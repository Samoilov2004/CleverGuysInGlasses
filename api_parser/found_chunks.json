Test C: Experimental protocol for circadian cell assay </p> Mperl-luc Rat-1 (P2C4) fibroblast cultures were prepared by dividing the cultures every 3-4 days (about 10-20% of confluence) on 150 cm<sup>2</sup> degassed polystyrene tissue culture flasks (Falcon® # 35-5001) and maintained in growth medium [EMEM (Cellgro #10-010-CV) ; 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco #16000-044); and 50 I.U./mL of penicillin-streptomycin (Cellgro #30-001-Cl) ] at 37°C and under 5% C0<sub>2</sub>. </p>Cells obtained from Rat-1 fibroblast cultures at 30-50% of confluence as described above were co-transfected with vectors containing the selection marker for resistance to zeocin for a stable transfection and a luciferase reporter gene directed by the promoter mPer-1. After 24 to 48 hours, the cultures were divided on 96-well plates and maintained in growth medium supplemented with 50-100 yg/mL of zeocin (Invitrogen® #45-0430) for 10-14 days. The zeocin-resistant \n\nstable transfectants were evaluated for expression of the reporter by adding to the growth medium luciferin 100 μΜ (Promega® #E1603®) and by assaying the luciferase activity on a TopCount® scintillation counter (Packard model #C384V00) . The Rat-1 cell clones expressing both zeocin resistance and luciferase activity directed by mPerl were serum-shock-synchronized with 50% horse serum [HS (Gibco® #16050-122)] and the activity of the circadian reporter was evaluated. The P2C4 clone of fibroblasts Mperl-luc Rat-1 was selected to test the compound. </p>The Mperl-luc Rat-1 (P2C4) fibroblasts at 40-50% of confluence obtained according to the protocol described above were plated out onto 96-well opaque tissue culture plates (Perkin Elmer® #6005680) . The cultures are maintained in growth medium supplemented with 100 yg/mL of zeocin (Invitrogen #45-0430) until they reached 100% of confluence (48-72 hours) . The cultures were then synchronized with 100 yL of synchronization medium [EMEM (Cellgro #10-010-CV) ; 100 I.U./mL of penicillin-streptomycin (Cellgro #30-001-Cl); 50% HS (Gibco #16050-122)] for 2 hours at 37°C and under 5% C0<sub>2</sub>. After synchronization, the cultures were rinsed with 100 yL of EMEM (Cellgro #10-010-CV) for 10 minutes at room temperature. After rinsing, the medium was replaced with 300 yL of C0<sub>2</sub>-independent medium [C0<sub>2</sub>I (Gibco #18045-088); L-glutamine 2 mM (Cellgro #25-005-Cl) ; 100 U.I./mL of penicillin-streptomycin (Cellgro #30-001-Cl); luciferin 100 yM (Promega #E 1603) ] . The compounds of the invention tested for the circadian effects were added to C02~independent medium in DMSO at 0.3% (final concentration) . The cultures were immediately closed in a leaktight manner with TopSeal- A® film (Packard #6005185) and transferred for the luciferase activity measurement. \n\nAfter synchronization, the test plates were maintained at 37°C in a tissue culture oven (Forma Scientific Model #3914) . The in vivo luciferase activity was estimated by measuring the relative light emission on a TopCount scintillation counter (Packard model #C384V00). </p>The period analysis was performed either by determining the interval between the relative light emission minima over several days or by Fourier transform. The two methods produced a virtually identical period estimation on a range of circadian periods. The power is given in EC Delta (t+lh) , which is presented as the effective micromolar concentration that induce a 1-hour prolongation of the period. The data were analysed by adjusting a hyperbolic curve to the data expressed as change of period (y-axis) as a function of the concentration of the test compound (x-axis) in the XLfit™ software and the EC Delta (t+lh) was interpolated from this curve .

PGD2 is detected at high concentration in an asthmatic's bronchoalveolar fluid (NPL 2), and it was reported that bronchoconstriction was induced by prostaglandin D2 inhalation in asthmatic patients but not healthy subjects (NPL 3) .</p>On the other hand, synthases that generate PGD2 are referred to as prostaglandin D synthases. Two different types, hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase and lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase, are known to exist. PGD2 participates in the onset and exacerbation of various diseases, including allergies, and in the regulatory mechanisms of the body; therefore, pharmaceutical preparations that can ameliorate excess production are considered to be very effective in the treatment of various diseases.</p>Human hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthases (H-PGDS) are mainly distributed throughout the placenta, lung, fetus liver, lymph node, brain, heart, thymus, bone marrow, and spleen. Moreover, at the cellular level, they are reported to be expressed in microglia in the brain, megakaryocyte, and Langerhans cells in the skin; Kupffer cells in the liver; macrophages; and many antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, mast cells, and Th2 cells.</p>Moreover, from the fact that H-PGDS are highly expressed in mast cells or inflammatory cells at nasal mucosa in allergic rhinitis, or nasal polyps in chronic sinusitis, it is thought that PGD2 produced by H-PGDS plays an important role in the onset and exacerbation of allergic diseases, such as asthma, rhinosinusitis, dermatitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (NPL4). Further, the expression of H-PGDS is confirmed in the necrosed part of skeletal muscle, in which the expression of H-PGDS does not generally occur (NPL5). For this reason, it is suggested that PGD2 produced by a hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase participates in diseases accompanied by tissue damage, such as muscular dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic obstructive arterial disease (NPL6).</p>Therefore, an H-PGDS inhibitor is expected to find application as a pharmaceutical preparation that is useful as an agent for preventing and/or treating diseases such as allergic disease and inflammatory disease in which PGD2 produced by a hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase or metabolite thereof participates, and muscle necrosis and traumatic brain injury.</p>There are some reports on an H-PGDS inhibitor (for example, PTL 1 and 2), and Patent Literature 3 discloses an H-PGDS inhibitor having a structure similar to that of the compound of the present invention.

(J. Biol. Chem., 262, 3820-3825, (1987)). More specifically, the reaction mixture (49 µL) containing 100 may Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM reduced glutathione, 0.1 mg/mL y-globulin, and human H-PGDS (q.s.), and a compound (final concentration: 0.01-100 µM) was preincubated at 25°C for 5 minutes. Note that a DMSO solution (final concentration: 1%) was added to the solvent control group. Subsequently, 1 µL of [14C] prostaglandin H2 (final concentration: 10 µM) was added to start the reaction. One minute after the start of the reaction, 250 µL of a reaction stopper solution (diethylether/methanol/1 M citric acid (30/4/1) at a temperature of -20°C was added to stop the reaction. After the reaction was stopped, 50 µL of the upper layer portion (organic solvent phase) was applied to a TLC plate and developed at -20° C for 45 minutes (developing solvent: diethylether/methanol/acetic acid (90/2/1)). After drying the TLC plate, the TLC plate was exposed to an imaging plate for 1 to 24 hours, and the radioactivity corresponding to prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) was analyzed using an image analyzer (produced by Fujifilm Corporation). The area (%) occupied by the PGD2 band per lane was calculated to determine the inhibition rate (%) of each Example compound at 0.1 µM relative to the control group in each experiment as well as the inhibition concentration at 50% (IC50 value, nM) relative to H-PGDS.

Compound of formula (I) according to any one of Claims 1 to 17 as a medicament. </claim-text>\n\n HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS, THEIR PREPARATION AND THEIR THERAPEUTIC </p> APPLICATION. </p> The invention is directed to certain novel compounds, methods for producing them and methods for treating or ameliorating a disorder involving tyrosine kinase dysregulation such as disorder associated with increased vascular permeability or angiogenesis. More particularly, this invention is directed to substituted triazolopyridine compounds useful as selective kinase inhibitors, methods for producing such compounds and methods for treating, preventing or ameliorating a kinase-mediated disorder. In particular, the methods relate to treating or ameliorating a disorder involving tyrosine kinase dysregulation including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, diabetes-associated disorders, inflammatory diseases, immunological disorders, cancer and diseases of the eye such as retinopathies, macular degeneration or other vitreoretinal diseases, and the like. </p> Passage of fluid and cells out of blood vessels is a significant contributing factor to inflammation, tissue injury, oedema and death in a variety of circumstances. These include ischemic injury, toxic shock, burns, trauma, allergic and immune reactions. Vascular permeability is regulated in part by cell-cell adhesions between endothelial cells. The endothelial cell monolayer lining the vasculature forms a barrier that maintains the integrity of the blood fluid compartment, but permits passage of soluble factors and leukocytes in a regulated manner. Dysregulation of this process results in vascular leakage into surrounding tissues, which accompanies the inflammation associated with pathological oedematous conditions. Vascular permeability is a finely-tuned function that can positively contribute to protective immune responses and wound healing; however, in a number of pathological situations, massive and/or chronic leakage of fluid as well as migration of immune cells into tissues can have serious, and sometimes, life-threatening consequences. </p> Abnormal retinal vascular permeability leading to oedema in the area of the macula is the leading cause of vision loss in diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, exudative macular degeneration, retinal vascular occlusions, and inflammatory and neoplastic conditions. Although a variety of disease processes may lead to increased vascular permeability through different mechanisms, the cytokine VEGF is known to play a major role as inducer of vascular leakage. VEGF was first described as a potent vascular permeability factor (VPF) secreted by tumour cells that stimulated a rapid and reversible increase in microvascular permeability. Increased vascular permeability in ischemic retinopathies and possibly also in exudative macular degeneration and uveitis, for example, correlated with VEGF levels and VEGF antagonists have been successfully \n\n used to reduce retinal/macular oedema in neovascular eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration leading to stabilization or even improvement of visual acuity in a subset of affected patients. The way by which VEGF induces vascular permeability has recently been unravelled and it has been shown that VEGF-induced vascular leakage is mediated by cytoplasmic protein kinase members of the Src proto oncogene family. </p> Protein kinases play a central role in the regulation and maintenance of a wide variety of cellular processes and cellular functions. For example, kinase activity acts as a molecular switch regulating cell proliferation, activation, and/or differentiation. It is now widely accepted that many diseases result from abnormal cellular responses triggered by overactive protein kinase-mediated pathways. </p> Src kinases form a family of membrane-attached non receptor-dependent tyrosine kinases encompassing eight members in mammals: Src, Fyn, Yes, Fgr, Lyn, Hck, Lck, and Blk which have important roles in receptor signalling and cellular communication. While most Src kinases are broadly expressed (i.e. Src, Fyn, Yes), certain members of the family such as Hck, Blk or Lck exhibit a restricted expression. Src kinases play a pivotal role as membrane-attached molecular switches that link a variety of extracellular cues to intracellular signalling pathways. This is the basis for the involvement of Src kinases in cell proliferation and differentiation as well as cell adhesion and migration. </p> It has been well-documented that Src protein levels and Src kinase activity are significantly elevated in human cancers including breast cancers, colon cancers, pancreatic cancers, certain B-cell leukemias and lymphomas, gastrointestinal cancer, non-small cell lung cancers, bladder cancer, prostate and ovarian cancers, melanoma and sarcoma. Thus, it has been anticipated that blocking signalling through the inhibition of the kinase activity of Src will be an effective means of modulating aberrant pathways that drive oncologic transformation of cells. </p> Similarly, it is well documented that Src-family kinases are also important for signalling downstream of immune cell receptors. Fyn, like Lck, is involved in TCR signalling in T cells. Hck and Fgr are involved in Fey receptor signalling leading to neutrophil activation. Lyn and Src also participate in Fey receptor signaling leading to release of histamine and other allergic mediators. These findings suggest that Src family kinase inhibitors may be useful in treating allergic diseases and asthma. </p> In accordance with the effect of VEGF on vascular permeability, several reports support a role of Src kinase in the development of oedema. For instance, Src but not Fyn deficiency or blockade of Src reduced brain oedema by about 55% following permanent \n\n cerebral ischemia in mice. Recently, PP1 , a Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor was found to decrease oedema, to decrease breakdown of the brain-blood barrier (BBB), to reduce expression of VEGF. Similarly, Scheppke et al. have shown that Src kinases are critical mediators of VEGF- and ischemia-induced retinal vascular leakage. </p> Furthermore, Src tyrosine kinases fully mediate VEGF receptor signalling in vascular endothelial cells. Thus, activation of Src kinases resulting from stimulation of VEGF receptor or other growth factor located on endothelial cells or progenitors triggers angiogenesis, a response which can be deleterious in retinal and corneal diseases and which markedly contributes to tumor development and metastasis migration. </p> Several classes of compounds have been disclosed that modulate or, more specifically, inhibit kinase activity as potential treatments of kinase-mediated disorders, particularly cancer. </p> For example, WO2001038315 describes aminoquinazolines as inhibitors of cyclin- dependent kinases. </p> WO2008068507 describes pyridinylquinazolines as Raf serine/threonine kinase inhibitors for treating cancer. </p> WO2008079988 describes quinazolines as PDK1 kinase inhibitors for treating proliferative diseases such as cancer. </p> WO20061 18256 describes quinazoline derivatives as p38MAPK inhibitors for inhalation and for treating various inflammatory diseases and cancer. </p> WO2006039718 describes aryl nitrogen-containing bicyclic compounds for use in treating protein kinase-mediated disease, including inflammation, cancer and related conditions. </p> WO2005037285 describes 2,6-disubstituted bicyclic heterocycles as Raf serine/threonine kinase inhibitors for treating disorders such as cancer. </p> WO2009046448 describes PI3 kinase activity modulators having substituted aminoquinazoline on the pyrimidine part of the quinazoline bicycle. </p> WO2009084695 describes aminoquinazoline derivatives substituted by two non- aromatic substituents. </p> WO2008020203 describes aminoquinazoline derivatives substituted by pyridine on the phenyl part of the quinazoline bicycle and having B-Raf inhibiting activity. \n\n US20100093698 describes aminotriazolopyridines derivatives substituted in position 5 and having Syk kinase inhibition activity. </p> WO2004065378 describes 2-aminopyridines as cdk4 inhibitors for treating cell proliferative disorders such as cancer, atherosclerosis and restenosis. </p> Interestingly, WO2006024034 describes heterocyclic compounds derived from benzotriazine, triazines, triazoles and oxadiazoles, such as benzotriazine compounds (WO2005096784) or pyrimidine compounds (WO2006101977) which are capable of inhibiting kinases, such as members of the Src kinase family. Nevertheless, these drugs while they are claimed as potentially useful as for treatment of various ophthalmological diseases (e.g. age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular oedema, cancer, and glaucoma) are lipophilic and water insoluble (see WO200613341 1 ). According to the inventors of WO200613341 1 , these specific properties are particularly advantageous, particularly for ophthalmic uses, since these drugs being insoluble in water (water solubility of less than about 0.1 mg/mL at a pH range of 4-8) possess high efficiency of loading and negligible leakage due to high partitioning of the drug into the liposome used for delivering them compared to the water. </p> WO 2010076238 describes mono-substituted aminoquinazoline derivatives having a good IC50 against src and lyn kinases. </p> Src kinases inhibitors described in US2005/0245524 are bright red in colour and very insoluble in formulations suitable for delivery by eye drops. These two parameters represent an important drawback for the compounds disclosed in US2005/0245524. </p> The eye is a tightly protected organ. In this respect, treating diseases of the back- of-the-eye is probably the most difficult and challenging task of drug discovery as evidenced by the paucity of therapeutic options. One of the most convenient and safest form of drug delivery to the eye is eye drops, since it is non invasive, does not require medical assistance and requires small volumes of drug solution. However, in order to be suitable for topical instillation, molecules have to be potent enough towards their molecular target, to present physico-chemical properties allowing crossing of cell membranes, and to be sufficiently soluble in aqueous medium to be applied as solution onto the cornea. In addition, it is crucial that such drug molecules are as colourless as possible to prevent staining of ocular tissue which ultimately may interfer with vision. Additionally, due to the multiple cross reactivity between kinases, it is highly desirable that said drug molecules inhibit the targeted kinases with a high degree of selectivity. \n\n A feature of the present invention is to provide novel compounds which have increased water solubility compared to competitors. </p> Another feature of the present invention is to provide compounds that are highly potent, particularly towards src kinase inhibitors. </p> Another feature of the present invention is to provide compounds which are useful for treating, preventing or ameliorating a disorder, including an ophthalmic disorder, involving tyrosine kinase dysregulation such as for example disorder associated with increased vascular permeability or angiogenesis. </p> Another feature of the present invention is to provide compounds which are colourless or almost colourless, especially in solution. </p> Additional features and advantages of the present invention will be set forth in part in the description that follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the present invention. The objectives and other advantages of the present invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the description and appended claims. </p> The invention relates to compound of the general formula below: </p><img id=\"imgf000006_0001\" path=\"imgf000006_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171271346/WO/20111229/A1/002011/16/11/59/imgf000006_0001.tif\"/>\n wherein </p>A is an aryl, an heterocycloalkyl, a -N-aryl, a -O-aryl, an heteroaryl, or a partially saturated heterocycloalkyl; </p>B is an heteroaryl or an aryl; </p>R1 and R2 are linked on a cycle and represent independently from each other: </p> -H, </p> -OH, </p> an halogen atom, </p> -OidCeJalkyl, </p> (Ci-C<sub>6</sub>) alkyle, </p> -(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>OH, </p> - NH<sub>2</sub>, \n\n N-oxide wherein the nitrogen atom belongs to A, </p>with the provisio that R1 and R2 can both be hydrogen atoms only when A is a </p>heterocycloalkyi, a -O-aryl, an heteroaryl or a partially substituted heterocycloalkyle; R3, R4 and R5 are, independently from each other, </p> -H, </p> -(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>OH, </p> -0(dd)alkyl, </p> -(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-CO-heterocycloalkyl, </p> -OH, </p> -heterocycloalkyl-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-OH, </p> -(d-d) alkyl, </p> -(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-heterocycloalkyl, </p> -(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-heterocycloalkyl-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-OH, </p> -0-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-heterocycloalkyl, </p> N-oxide wherein the nitrogen atom belongs to B, </p> -0-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-CO-heterocycloalkyl, </p> -0-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-OH, </p> -0(dd)alkyl-NR7R8, </p> -(dd)alkyl-NR7R8, </p> with the provisio that when A and B are aryl, at least two of R3, R4 and R5 are not hydrogen; </p> R6 is H, -0(dd)alkyl, or (dd)alkyl; </p> R7 and R8 are independently from each other H or (dd)alkyl; </p>n is 1 , 2 or 3; </p>X is N or C; and </p>Y is C or a bond, </p>as well as a prodrug thereof. </p> According to one embodiment, the invention concerns compounds of formula (I) as well as a prodrug of compounds of formula (I) : </p><img id=\"imgf000007_0001\" path=\"imgf000007_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171271347/WO/20111229/A1/002011/16/11/59/imgf000007_0001.tif\"/>\n wherein </p>A is phenyl; </p>B is phenyl, pyridine, or pyrimidine </p> R1 and R2 represent independently from each other: </p> -H, </p> -OH, </p> a halogen atom, </p>with the provisio that R1 and R2 are not simultaneously hydrogen atoms; </p>R3, R4 and R5 are, independently from each other, </p> -H, </p> -(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>OH, </p> -0(dd)alkyl, </p> -(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-CO-heterocycloalkyl, </p> -OH, </p> -heterocycloalkyl-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-OH, </p> -(d-d) alkyl, </p> -(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-heterocycloalkyl, </p> -(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-heterocycloalkyl-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-OH, </p> -0-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-heterocycloalkyl, </p> N-oxide wherein the nitrogen atom belongs to B, </p> -0-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-CO-heterocycloalkyl, </p> -0-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>-OH, </p> -0(dd)alkyl-NR7R8, </p> -(dd)alkyl-NR7R8, </p> - or R3 and R4 form together with B a fused bicycle (such as for example indole or benzimidazole, optionally substituted by R5, </p> with the provisio that when A and B are aryl, at least two of R3, R4 and R5 are not hydrogen; </p> R6 is H, -0(dd)alkyl, or (dd)alkyl; </p> R7 and R8 are independently from each other H or an optionally substituted (dd)alkyl optionally forming a cycloalkyl; </p>n is 1 , 2 or 3; </p>X is N or C; and </p> Y is CH or a covalent bond. \n\n This group of compounds of the Invention can be represented by formula (la) below : </p><img id=\"imgf000009_0001\" path=\"imgf000009_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171271348/WO/20111229/A1/002011/16/11/59/imgf000009_0001.tif\"/>\n (la) </p>wherein R1 , R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, and R8 are as defined in the invention according to any embodiment or combination thereof. </p>In the context of the present specification, the terms defined below should be uderstood as having the meaning defined next to each term: </p> - \"a\" and \"an\" are used in the sense that they mean \"at least one\", \"at least a first\", \"one or more\" or \"a plurality\" of the referenced compounds or steps, unless the context dictates otherwise.

Caliper LC3000 and EZ Reader II instruments are widely used throughout the drug discovery process for assay development, primary screening, selectivity screening, generation of Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs) and Mechanism of Action (MOA) studies. The LabChip ™ technology is particularly well suited for enzymatic 'targets' such as kinases, proteases, \n\n phosphatases, histone deacetylases (HDAC), phosphodiesterases (PDE), and acyl- transferases. The key benefit of the technology is the separation and direct measurement of substrates and products, which allows for higher signal-to-noise ratios and fewer false positive/negative results. This direct measurement also allows for the identification and elimination of enzymatic activities that are not associated with the kinase reaction of interest. </p> General : </p> The off-chip incubation mobility-shift kinase assay uses a microfluidic chip to measure the conversion of a fluorescent peptide substrate to a phosphorylated product. The reaction mixture, from a microtiter plate well, is introduced through a capillary sipper onto the chip, where the nonphosphorylated substrate and phosphorylated product are separated by electrophoresis and detected via laser-induced fluorescence. The signature of the fluorescence signal over time reveals the extent of the reaction. The phosphorylated product migrates through the chip faster than the non-phosphorylated substrate, and signals from the two forms of the peptide appear as distinct peaks. Caliper's data analysis software (HTSWA) determines peak heights, from which the ratio of product to the peak sum P/(P+S) and percent (% ) conversion is calculated. This value is used to compare compound wells to control wells present on the plate, and thereby determine the % inhibition values for the compound. The formula used to calculate % inhibition is as follows, where Ci<sub>0</sub>o<sub>%</sub> is the average % conversion of the 100% activity wells and C<sub>0%</sub> is the average % conversion of the 0% activity wells: </p> (1 -(%conversionofsample - C<sub>0</sub>%)/(C ioo%-Co%))<sup>*</sup>100 </p> Specific: </p> LC3000 Src Assays </p> Compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO and diluted to 25X the final desired screening concentration. Serial dilutions were performed to obtain the concentrations specified for particular studies. One μΙ_ of each concentration was transferred, in duplicate, to a 384-well Greiner microtiter plate. Generally, 12 μΙ_ of enzyme buffer containing purified kinase (various suppliers), 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT (Calbiochem, 2333153), 10 mM MgCI<sub>2</sub> (Sigma, M-1028) or 10 mM MnCI<sub>2</sub> (Sigma, M- 1787) (assay specific), and 0.002% Brij-35 (Sigma, B4184) was added to each well. Compound and enzyme were allowed to pre-incubate for 15 minutes. 12 μΙ_ of peptide/ATP buffer containing 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 .5 μΜ fluorescein-labeled peptide (specific to kinase of interest), ATP (at K<sub>M</sub> apparent, Sigma, A9187), and 0.002% \n\n Brij-35 was then added to each well to initiate the reaction. Generally, reactions were incubated for 1 - 1 .5 hours at room temperature to obtain adequate (15-40%) conversion of peptide to phosphorylated product in the linear range of the reaction. Reactions were terminated with the addition of 45 μΙ_ of Stop Buffer (containing 20 mM EDTA). Plates 5 were then read on the LabChip 3000 using a 12-sipper LabChip. % conversion values and % inhibition values were obtained as described and IC<sub>50</sub> curves of compounds were generated using Graphpad Prism Version 4 or 5.01 . A nonlinear curve fit using the sigmoidal dose response - variable slope fit was used to graph IC<sub>50</sub> curves and determine IC<sub>50</sub> values and hillslopes. </p> 10 It has been shown that the compounds of the Invention have IC50 against Src kinases of &lt; 200nM. Preferred compounds are those having IC50 against Src kinases of &lt; 100 nM. </p>Table 1 </p><img id=\"imgf000032_0001\" path=\"imgf000032_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171271363/WO/20111229/A1/002011/16/11/59/imgf000032_0001.tif\"/></p><img id=\"imgf000033_0001\" path=\"imgf000033_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171271364/WO/20111229/A1/002011/16/11/59/imgf000033_0001.tif\"/><img id=\"imgf000034_0001\" path=\"imgf000034_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171271365/WO/20111229/A1/002011/16/11/59/imgf000034_0001.tif\"/>\n compound 4- Chloro-3-[2- M + 1 = 368.0 47 14 (6-</p>NMR:9.85 (s, 1H);8.78 hydroxymethyl- /—OH </p> (d,2H);8.18(d, 1H); </p> pyridin-3- ylamino)- nr<sup>cl</sup> 7.63 (s, 2H); 7.39 (d, </p> 2H); 6.90 (m, 2H); 5.32 </p> [1,2,4]triazolo[1, </p> (bb, 1H);4.50 (s, 2H) </p> 5- a]pyridin-6- yl]-phenol </p>compound 3- [2-(3,5-Bis- M + 1 = 408.0 0.1 16 hydroxymethyl-</p>NMR: 10.0 (bb, 1H, OH); phenylamino)- 9.91 (s, 1H);9.35 (s, 1H); quinazolin-6-yl]- 7.95-7.83 (m, 4H); 7.69</p>4- chloro-phenol </p> (d, 1H);7.37 (d, 1H); </p> 6.94 (s, 1H); 6.84 (m, 2H); 5.18 (bb, 2H); 4.51 (s, 4H) </p> Compoun 4-Chloro-3-[2- M + 1 = 349.0 2 d 17 (pyridin-3-</p>NMR : 10.18 (s, 1H); </p> ylamino)- 9.41 (s, 1H); 9.10 (s, 1H); quinazolin-6-yl]- 8.47(d, 1H); 8.21 (d, 1H); phenol N N </p> H 7.99 (s, 1H);7.88 (dd, </p> 1H);7.75 (d, 1H);7.38 (m, 2H);6.84 (m, 2H) </p> Compoun 4- Chloro-3-[2- M + 1 =376.1 39 d 18 (1 H-indol-6-</p>NMR : 10.93 (s, 1H); </p> ylamino)- 9.48 (s, 1H);8.79 (s, 1H); </p> [1,2,4]triazolo[1, </p> 7.99 (s, 1H);7.58 (s, 2H);</p>5- a]pyridin-6-</p>HO 7.39 (m, 2H);7.16(m, yl]-phenol </p> 2H); 6.89 (m, 2H); 6.31 (s, 1H) \n\n\n<img id=\"imgf000036_0001\" path=\"imgf000036_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171271366/WO/20111229/A1/002011/16/11/59/imgf000036_0001.tif\"/>\n \n\n\n<img id=\"imgf000037_0001\" path=\"imgf000037_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171271367/WO/20111229/A1/002011/16/11/59/imgf000037_0001.tif\"/>\n \n\n\n<img id=\"imgf000038_0001\" path=\"imgf000038_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171271368/WO/20111229/A1/002011/16/11/59/imgf000038_0001.tif\"/>\n \n\n\n<img id=\"imgf000039_0001\" path=\"imgf000039_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171271369/WO/20111229/A1/002011/16/11/59/imgf000039_0001.tif\"/>\n \n\n\n<img id=\"imgf000040_0001\" path=\"imgf000040_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171271370/WO/20111229/A1/002011/16/11/59/imgf000040_0001.tif\"/>\n \n\n</p><img id=\"imgf000041_0001\" path=\"imgf000041_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171271371/WO/20111229/A1/002011/16/11/59/imgf000041_0001.tif\"/></p><img id=\"imgf000042_0001\" path=\"imgf000042_0001.tif\" file=\"https://surechembl.org/api/assets/attachment/171271372/WO/20111229/A1/002011/16/11/59/imgf000042_0001.tif\"/>\n 3H) </p> Compoun 4-Chloro-3-(2- M + 1 =506.01 0.2 d50 {3-[4-(2-</p>NMR : 9.77 (s, 1H); 9.33 hydroxy-ethy </p> (s, 1H);8.16(s, 1H); </p> l)-piperazin-1- 7.94(s, 1H);7.86 (dd, yl]-5- 1H);7.71 (s, 1H);7.67 hydroxymethyl- (d, 1H);7.38 (d, 1H), </p> 7.31 (s, 1H);6.88 (s, 1H); phenylamino}-</p>6.86 (dd, 1H);6.58 (s, quinazolin-6-yl)-</p>1H);4.44 (s, 2H); 3.56 (t, phenol </p> 2H); 3.17 (m, 4H); 2.61</p>(m, 4H); 2.47 (t, 2H) \n\n</p>All compounds of the invention are white or pale yellow powders, and in solution become pale yellow or colourless when in solution at the maximum concentration of solubilisation at pH 5. </p>Other data regarding some compounds of the invention are as follows: Table 2 </p> Flux between </p> In vitro Solubility 2 and 4 hours potency HPbCD 7% through 0,5 </p> Compound Colour </p> IC50 (nM) pH5 (mg/ml) cm2 of rabbit Src / Lyn (h) measured cornea </p> (Mg/h/cm2) </p>Compound Pale </p> &lt; 1 nM 1 ,2 17 </p> 16 Yellow </p>Compound Pale </p> 0.7 nM 1 ,5 6 </p> 43 Yellow </p>Compound Pale </p> 1 nM 2,3 8 </p> 45 Yellow \n\n Compound Pale </p> 0,8 nM &gt; 10 13 46 Yellow </p>Compound </p> 5 nM White 1 ,3 13 5 </p>Compound </p> 14 nM White 5,69 30 10 </p>Compound </p> 27 nM White 2,38 13 13 </p>Compound </p> 23 nM White 6,5 14 25 \n\n Compound </p> 83 nM White &gt;10 19 </p> 27 </p>Compound </p> 3 nM White 7,5 8 </p> 28 </p>Compounds n °1 to 50, including prodrugs (compounds n °48 and 49), not listed in table 2 show similar solubility and Corneal flux. </p> Accordingly above-recited problems of insolubility and coloration of compounds of the prior art have been solved by the compounds of the current invention.

Metalloproteinases are a superfamily of proteinases (enzymes) whose known numbers in recent years have increased dramatically. Based on structural and functional considerations these enzymes have been classified into families and subfamilies as described in N. M Hooper (1994) FEBS Letters 354:1-6. Examples of metalloproteinases include the matrixin family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) such as the collagenases (MMP1, MMP8, MMP13, MMP18), the gelatinases (MMP2, MMP9), the stromelysins (MMP3, MMP10, MMP11), the matrilysins (MMP7, MMP26), metalloelastase (MMP12), enamelysin (MP19), the membrane types MT-MMPs (MMP14, MMP15, MMP16, MMP17, MMP24, MMP25), and others (MMP20, MMP21, MMP22, MMP23a/b, MMP28); the ADAMs (a disintegrin, a metalloproteinase, also know as reprolysin or adamalysin or MDC) family which currently includes 32 known ADAMs with secretase and sheddase activity such as TNF converting enzyme (ADAM17), and 18 known ADAMTS (a disintegrin a metalloproteinase thrombospondin) including the aggrecanases (ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5); the astacin family which include enzymes such as procollagen processing proteinase (PCP); and other metalloproteinases such as the endothelin converting enzyme family and the angiotensin converting enzyme family.</p>Metalloproteinases are believed to be important in a plethora of physiological disease processes that involve tissue remodelling such as embryonic development, bone formation and uterine remodelling during menstruation. This is based on the ability of the metalloproteinases to cleave a broad range of matrix substrates such as collagen, proteoglycan and fibronectin. Metalloproteinases are also believed to be important in the processing, or secretion, of biological important cell mediators, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF); and the post translational proteolysis processing, or shedding, of biologically important membrane proteins, such as the low affinity IgE receptor CD23 (for a more complete list see N. M. Hooper et al., (1997) Biochem J. 321:265-279). Metalloproteinases have been associated with many disease conditions. Inhibition of the activity of one or more metalloproteinases may well be of benefit in these disease conditions, for example: various inflammatory and allergic diseases such as, inflammation of the joint (especially rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout), inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract (especially inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and gastritis), inflammation of the skin (especially psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis); in tumour metastasis or invasion; in disease associated where degradation outstrips synthesis of the extracellular matrix such as osteoarthritis; in bone resorptive disease (such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease); in diseases associated with aberrant angiogenesis; the enhanced collagen remodelling associated with diabetes, periodontal disease (such as periodontitis), corneal ulceration, ulceration of the skin, post-operative conditions (such as colonic anastomosis) and dermal wound healing; demyelinating diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems (such as multiple sclerosis); Alzheimer's disease; extracellular matrix remodelling observed in cardiovascular diseases such as restenosis and atherosclerosis; and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, COPD.</p>A number of metalloproteinase inhibitors are known; different classes of compounds may have different degrees of potency and selectivity for inhibiting various metalloproteinases. The present inventors have discovered a new class of compounds that are inhibitors of metalloproteinases and are of particular interest in inhibiting collagenase 3 (also known as MMP-13). The compounds of this invention have superior potency and/or pharmacokinetic properties.</p>Collagenase 3 (MMP13) was initially cloned from a cDNA library derived from a breast tumour [J. M. P. Freije et al (1994) Journal of Biological Chemistry 269(24):16766-16773]. PCR-RNA analysis of RNAs from a wide range of tissues indicated that collagenase 3 (MMP13) expression was limited to breast carcinomas as it was not found in breast fibroadenomas, normal or resting mammary gland, placenta, liver, ovary, uterus, prostate or parotid gland or in breast cancer cell lines (T47-D, MCF-7 and ZR75-1). Subsequent to this observation collagenase 3 (MMP13) has been detected in transformed epidermal keratinocytes [N. Johansson et al., (1997) Cell Growth Differ. 8(2):243-250], squamous cell carcinomas [N. Johansson et al., (1997) Am. J. Pathol. 151(2):499-508] and epidermal tumours [K. Airola et al., (1997) J. Invest. Dermatol. 109(2):225-231]. These results are suggestive that collagenase 3 (MMP 13) is secreted by transformed epithelial cells and may be involved in the extracellular matrix degradation and cell-matrix interaction associated with metastasis especially as observed in invasive breast cancer lesions and in malignant epithelia growth in skin carcinogenesis.</p>Recent published data implies that collagenase 3 (MMP13) plays a role in the turnover of other connective tissues. For instance, consistent with collagenase 3 (MMP13) substrate specificity and preference for degrading type II collagen [P. G. Mitchell et al., (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 97(3):761-768; V. Knauper et al., (1996) The Biochemical Journal 271:1544-1550], collagenase 3 (MP13) has been hypothesised to serve a role during primary ossification and skeletal remodelling [M. Stahle-Backdahl et al., (1997) Lab. Invest. 76(5):717-728; N. Johansson et al., (1997) Dev. Dyn. 208(3):387-397], in destructive joint diseases such as rheumatoid and osteo-arthritis [D. Wernicke et al., (1996) J. Rheumatol. 23:590-595; P. G. Mitchell et al., (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 97(3):761-768; O. Lindy et al., (1997) Arthritis Rheum 40(8):1391-1399]; and during the aseptic loosening of hip replacements [S. Imai et al., (1998) J. Bone Joint Surg. Br. 80(4):701-710]. Collagenase 3 (MMP13) has also been implicated in chronic adult periodontitis as it has been localised to the epithelium of chronically inflamed mucosa human gingival tissue [V. J. Uitto et al., (1998) Am. J. Pathol 152(6):1489-1499] and in remodelling of the collagenous matrix in chronic wounds [M. Vaalamo et al., (1997) J. Invest.
