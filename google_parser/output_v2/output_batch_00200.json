Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a novel 3,4-dihydrobenzoxazine compound having an inhibitory effect on vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1) activity and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient, and a method for treating and/or preventing diseases to which the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1) activity is involved, such as pain, acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, rheumatoid arthritis pain, neuralgia, etc., particularly pain.\n\n\nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\nCapsaicin, which is the main ingredient of red pepper, is a pungency causing ingredient as well as a pain producing substance. It has been reported that many nociceptive nerves, particularly unmyelinated C fibers have capsaicin sensitivity and it is known that C fibers will selectively drop out when capsaicin is administered to an infant rodent. It has been also reported that there are many sites of action for capsaicin distributed in the skin, cornea, and oral mucosa, and the distribution thereof is also observed in the muscles, joints and internal organs, particularly in the cardiovascular system, respiratory system and bladder urinary tract system, and it is important for activation of sensory nerve. In addition, capsaicin sensitivity is also observed in the nerves of the preoptic area of the thalamus, and involvement in the regulation of body temperature is presumed. Depolarization by inflow of Na\n+\n and Ca\n2+\n by capsaicin administration is observed in the nociceptive nerves and discharge of glutamic acid and neuropeptides (mainly Substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) from the center side end of the primary afferent fiber of the spinal dorsal horn is resulted. Now that specific binding activity of resiniferatoxin (RTX) which brings about similar effects to that of capsaicin has been observed, and that capsazepine has been revealed as a competitive inhibitor, liposoluble capsaicin is considered to act on receptor protein (see Szallasi A, Blumberg P M. (1999) Pharmacol. Rev. 51, 159-212 (Non-Patent Document 1)).\n\n\nThe capsaicin receptor gene was cloned in 1997 (see, for example, Caterina M J, Schumacher M A Tominaga M, Posen T A, Levine J D, Julius D. (1997) Nature 389, 816-824 (Non-Patent Document 2)). It was presumed from its amino acid sequence that it was an ion channel having a six-transmembrane domain. Since capsaicin has a vanillyl group in the structure, it is generically referred to as vanilloids along with its analogs such as RTX, and the cloned receptor was named vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (hereinafter referred to as VR 1; This VR1 may be also referred to as TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1)). Then, electrophysiological functional analysis using the patch clamping method has been performed by making oocytes of \nXenopus laevis \nand human derived cultured cells to express VR1, and it has been revealed that VR1 is directly activated by capsaicin, without mediated by an intracellular second messenger (see, for example, Caterina M J, Schumacher M A Tominaga M, Posen T A, Levine J D, Julius D. (1997) Nature 389, 816-824 (Non-Patent Document 2)), and that VR1 is a non-selective cation ion channel having high Ca\n2+\n permeability with an outward rectification property (see, for example, Premkumar L S, Agarwal S, Steffen D. (2002) J. Physiol. 545, 107-117 (Non-Patent Document 3)).\n\n\nAlthough capsaicin is a pain causing substance, it is used as an analgesic agent to mitigate pain in diabetic neuropathy or rheumatic neurosis (see, for example, Szallasi A, Blumberg P M. (1999) Pharmacol. Rev. 51, 159-212 (Non-Patent Document 1)). It is understood that such mitigation is resulted from a phenomenon that the sensory nerve end exposed to capsaicin stops answering to pain stimulus that is, desensitization. Although it is considered that the desensitization mechanism of VR1 involves Ca\n2+\n-mediated regulation, regulation depending on potential, activity control of VR1 by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, etc., many points remain unclear.\n\n\nAs well as capsaicin, heat and acid also cause pain and it is known that the capsaicin sensitive nociceptive nerves respond to two or more types of stimulation. It was found that VR1 was directly activated by not only capsaicin but heat stimulation of 43° C. or more (see, for example, Yang D, Gereau R W 4th. (2002) J. Neurosci. 22, 6388-6393 (Non-Patent Document 4)). The temperature of 43° C. is mostly in agreement with the temperature threshold which causes a pain in humans and animals, suggesting that VR1 participates in nociceptive heat stimulation receptance.\n\n\nAcidification occurs in an organ in the case of inflammation or ischemia and it is known to cause or enhance pain (see, for example, Bevan S, Geppetti P. (1994) Trends Neurosci. 17, 509-512 (Non-Patent Document 5)). It has turned out that when the pH outside cells is reduced within the limits of the acidification which takes place in the case of an organ lesion, VR1 can be directly activated by the acidification (proton) alone, and it is surmised that VR1 is the actual molecule which receives stimulation by acidification in an organ which takes place in the case of inflammation or ischemia (see, for example, Yang D, Gereau R W 4th. (2002) J. Neurosci. 22, 6388-6393 (Non-Patent Document 4)).\n\n\nImmunohistological analysis using a specific antibody has confirmed that the number of unmyelinated C fibers expressing VR1 increases in an inflamed region as compared in a normal region (see, for example, Carlton S M, Coggeshall R E. (2001) Neurosci. Lett. 310, 53-56 (Non-Patent Document 6)). The enhancement of VR1 expression in submucosal plexus has been actually observed in human inflammatory bowel disease (see, for example, Yiangou Y, Facer P, Dyer N H, Chan C L, Knowles C, Williams N S, Anand P. (2001) Lancet 357, 1338-1339 (Non-Patent Document 7)). Such an increase in the amount of VR1 expression causes peripheral sensitization in an inflamed organ and presumably contributes to duration of inflammatory hyperalgesia.\n\n\nIt has been also reported that extracellular ATP, bradykinin and a neuro growth factor which are inflammation related substances increase VR1 activity (see, for example, Tominaga M, Wada M, Masu M. (2001) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98, 6951-6956 (Non-Patent Document 8); Shu X, Mendell L M. (1999) Neurosci. Lett. 274, 159-162 (Non-Patent Document 9); Chuang H H, Prescott E D, Kong H, Shields S, Jordt S E, Basbaum A I, Chao, M V, Julius D. (2001) Nature 411, 957-962 (Non-Patent Document 10); and Sugiura T, Tominaga M, Katsuya H, Mizumura K. (2002) J. Neurophysiol. 88, 544-548 (Non-Patent Document 11)) and it is said to be a fact without doubt that VR1 involves in pain and hypersensitivity of pain including those caused by inflammation (see, for example, Numazaki M, Tominaga M (2003) Biochemistry 75, 359-371 (Non-Patent Document 12)).\n\n\nThe sensory nerve cells in a VR1-deficient mouse responded to none of capsaicin, proton and heat stimulation. It is also reported that in action analysis, VR1-deficient mouse does not show the pain reaction following capsaicin administration, and sensitivity to heat stimulation decreases and inflammatory hyperalgesia is not observed (see, for example, Caterina M J, Leffler A, Malmberg A B, Martin W J, Trafton J, Peterson-Zeitz K R, Koltzenburg M, Basbaum A I, Julius D. (2000) Science 288, 306-313 (Non-Patent Document 13) and Davis L B, Gray J, Gunthorpe M J et al. (2000) Nature 405, 183-187 (Non-Patent Document 14)). Thus, it has been confirmed also on an individual level from the analysis of VR1-deficient mouse that VR1 functions as a wide range pain stimulation receptor.\n\n\nMoreover, as for the relation between vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1) and a disease, it has been reported already that a substance which inhibits VR1 activity is useful as a therapeutical agent of various diseases.\n\n\nParticularly with regard to a therapeutical agent of pain, there is a report that capsazepine which is known as a VR1 antagonist has exhibited a significant analgesic effect in an animal model (see, for example, Ikeda Y, Ueno A, Naraba H, Oh-ishi S, (2001) Life Science 69, 2911-2919 (Non-Patent Document 15)), and use is expected as a new therapeutical agent of pain having an inhibitory effect of VR1 activity.\n\n\nIt has been confirmed with regard to bladder hyperstrain type frequent urination and urinary incontinence that the bladder contraction function of VR1-deficient mouse decreases and there is a report that a compound having a capsaicin-like pharmacological mechanism or a compound having an inhibitory action on VR1, i.e., a compound inhibiting vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1) activity is useful for improving bladder function, for example, as a therapeutical agent of frequent urination, urinary incontinence, etc (see, for example, (2002) Nat. Neurosci. 5, 856-860 (Non-Patent Document 16)).\n\n\nIn addition, another reference reports that a substance having an inhibitory effect to the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1), particularly antagonist of VR1 receptor is useful for preventing and treating diseases related to VR1 activity, particularly urgent urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, rheumatoid arthritis pain, neuralgia, neuropathy, hyperalgesia, nerve damage, ischemic symptom, neurodegenerative, cerebral apoplexy, incontinence, and inflammatory disease (see, for example, JP 2003-192673 (Patent Document 1)).\n\n\nFurthermore, it is also known that diseases relevant to the vanilloid receptor activity may include pain, acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, migraine, joint pain, neuropathy, nerve damage, diabetic nervous disease, neurodegenerative disease, neurogenic skin disorder, cerebral apoplexy, bladder hypersensitivity, irritable bowel syndrome, abnormalities in respiratory organs such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stimulation of skin, eye or mucosa, fever, stomach or duodenal ulcer, inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory disease, etc (see, for example, JP 2004-506714 T2 (Patent Document 2)).\n\n\nAccordingly, it can be said that substances having vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1) antagonistic activity is useful as a therapeutic agent for conditions in which C fibers participates, for example, not to mention pruritus, allergic and allergic rhinitis, overactive bladder type frequent urination and urinary incontinence, apoplexy, irritable bowel syndrome, respiratory ailment such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dermatitis, mucositis, stomach and duodenal ulcer, inflammatory bowel disease, etc. but also pain, acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, migraine, joint pain, neuropathy, nerve damage, diabetic nervous disease, neurodegenerative disease, rheumatoid arthritis pain, neuralgia, neuropathy, hyperalgesia, neurogenic skin disorder, apoplexy, overweight, urgent urinary incontinence, ischemic symptom and an inflammatory disease, etc.\n\n\nNext, compounds considered to relatively resemble the known vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1) antagonist and the compound of present invention are described.\n\n\nThe amide-type compounds represented by the following general formula [A], [B] and [C] are disclosed in WO03/068749 as compounds exhibiting antagonism to VR1 (Patent Document 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe urea-type compound represented by the following general formula [D] is disclosed in WO03/080578 as a compound exhibiting antagonism to VR1 (Patent Document 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuinuclidine-3′-yl 1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-2-carboxylate is disclosed as a compound exhibiting an inhibitory effect against capsaicin-induced extravasation of a plasma protein in the bladder is disclosed in WO03/006019 (Patent Document 5).\n\n\nThe urea-type compound represented by the following general formula [E] is disclosed in WO03/053945 as a compound exhibiting antagonism to VR1 (Patent Document 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compound represented by the following general formula [F] is disclosed as a compound in WO03/099284 as a compound exhibiting binding activity to VR1 (Patent Document 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, these compounds are different from the compound of the present invention in the structure, and there can be found no description which suggests the compound of the present invention.\n\n\nFor reference, the present inventors have previously made the patent application for a VR1 inhibitor represented by the following formula (PCT/JP2005/013446 (Patent Document 8)):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[Non-Patent Document 1] Szallasi A, Blumberg P M.

However, use of narcotic analgesics is severely restricted due to development of resistance/dependency and other serious side effects. It is known well other that an upper gastrointestinal tract disorder and a liver disorder frequently occur during long-term administration of nonnarcotic analgesics, and analgesic agent with a few side effects with higher analgesic effect is eagerly desired. Furthermore, as for diabetes-induced neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and neuropathic pain such as trigeminal neuralgia, no effective analgesic agent has been found yet and development of an effective analgesic agent thereof is also expected.\n\n\nCapsaicin-like compounds which act on VR1 are considered to develop the analgesic effect based on a pharmacological mechanism completely different from those of existing analgesic agents (block of capsaicin-sensitive nerves), and the efficacy is greatly expected as a therapeutic agent for neuropathic pain and the pain which originates in various conditions such as rheumatic arthritis for which the existing analgesic agents are not effective.\n\n\nThe fact that the final target of various inflammation related substances is VR1 suggests possibility that an agent which acts on VR1 is effective for various inflammatory pains and interstitial cystitis and its efficacy is greatly expected as an analgesic agent which replaces the existing analgesic agents.\n\n\nTherefore, the purpose of the present invention is to provide a new analgesic agent based on the pharmacological mechanism completely different from those of existing analgesic agents (block of capsaicin-sensitive nerves), i.e., VR1 activity inhibitor and to provide a novel compound for the same.\n\n\nMore specifically, the purpose of the present invention is to provide a VR1 activity inhibitor excellent in not only inhibitory activity on VR1 but also absorbability and sustainability which is more likely to be practically used.\n\n\nAnother purpose of the present invention is to provide a method for treating and/or preventing diseases to which the vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1) activity is involved, such as pain, acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, rheumatoid arthritis pain, neuralgia, etc., particularly pain.\n\n\nMeans for Solving the Problems\n\n\nAs a result of intensive study for developing an analgesic agent based on new action mechanism which will replace conventional analgesic agents such as nonnarcotic analgesics, pyrazolone analgesics, non-pyrazolone analgesics and NSAIDs, the present inventors have found out a 3,4-dihydrobenzoxazine compound which has excellent inhibitory activity on VR1 action and has more excellent absorbability and more excellent sustainability, and completed the present invention. The present invention is described in more detail below.\n\n \n \n1.

A fluorescent dye, Fura 2-AM solution (Dojindo Corporate, Cat. No. 343-05401) was added to the suspension to make a 5 μM concentration thereof. Further, Pluronic F-127 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Cat. No. P6866) was added to make a 0.1% content thereof. Then, the suspension was incubated at 37° C. for 30 min. The cells were harvested and washed two times with 20 mM MES buffer. The cells were suspended again to make a cell density of 5×10\n5 \ncells/mL. A 500-μL portion of the suspension was taken with a cuvette (MC MEDICAL, INC., Cat. No. SSR3121), to which 10 μL of 20 mM MES buffer containing 250 mM CaCl\n2 \nwas added to incorporate Ca\n2+\n into the cells. At the same time, 5 μL of a test compound solution (in a range of 100 μM to 10 nM in DMSO) was also added to provide a final concentration thereof in a range of 1 μM to 0.1 nM. Alternatively, 5 μL of DMSO was added as control to provide a final concentration of 1% DMSO. The suspension was set in an intracellular ionometer (CAF-110; JASCO) 10 min after those additions. The cells were stimulated with protons by addition of 50 μL of 20 mM MES buffer at pH 1.1 to the suspension to set its pH at 5.7. The activity of the test compound was determined as a difference between the minimum of fluorescence intensity before agonist stimulation and its maximum after the stimulation. The value of IC\n50 \nwas derived from percentage of inhibition by the test compound compared with the control.\n\n\nTest Example [2]\n\n\nMetabolic Stability Test in Liver S9;\n\n\nHuman liver S9 (final concentration: 2 mg protein/mL) was suspended in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (at pH 7.4, which contained β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate: 1.3 mM, D-glucose-6-phosphate: 3.3 mM, magnesium chloride: 3.3 mM and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase: 0.45 U/mL) and further mixed with the test compound dissolved in DMSO. The mixture was incubated at 37° C. for 0 and 60 minutes and then supplemented with acetonitrile containing formic acid (final concentration 0.1%). The test compound (uncharged) in a supernatant after centrifugation was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). A remaining ratio (%) was calculated from the obtained measurement value according to the following equation:\n\n\nRemaining ratio (%)=(amount of test compound after 60 minutes of incubation/amount of test compound on 0 minute of incubation)×100\n\n\n\nTest Example [3]\n\n\nIn-Vitro Membrane Permeability Test;\n\n\n10 mM DMSO solution of the test compound was diluted with Hanks buffer (pH 6.5) to 25 μM to make a test compound solution. 300 μL of Apical buffer (Hanks buffer (pH 6.5)) and 1 mL of Basolateral buffer (4.5% BSA-containing Hanks buffer (pH 7.4)) were added to the apical side (mucosal side) and the basolateral side (serosal side), respectively, of Caco2 cells (cells cultured for 6 days after seeding) seeded onto a plate for permeability test (BIOCOAT HTS Caco2 Assay system: BD Biosciences), and preincubated at 37° C. for 20 minutes, followed by measurement of a transepithelial electrical resistance value. Each buffer on the apical side and basolateral side was removed by aspiration. Then, 300 μL of the test compound solution and 1 mL of Basolateral buffer were added to the apical side and the basolateral side, respectively, and incubated at 37° C. for 2 hours with stirring at 60 rpm. Then, sampling was performed from each of the apical side and the basolateral side, and the sample was supplemented with acetonitrile and centrifuged. The test compound (uncharged) in the supernatant was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS: Quantum, Thermo Quest).\n\n\nA membrane permeability coefficient (Papp) was calculated according to the following equation:\n\n\n\nPapp\n(cm/sec.)=(\ndx/dt\n)/(\nA×C\n \n0\n)\n\n\n\n(wherein dx is the amount of the test compound (uncharged) on the basolateral side after incubation, dt is an incubation time, A is the surface area of the cell membrane, and C\n0 \nis the initial concentration of the test compound on the apical side.)\n\n\nTest Example [4]\n\n\nStability Test in Japanese Pharmacopoeia 1 Solution;\n\n\nThe test compound was dissolved in a mixed solution of CH\n3\nCN and Japanese Pharmacopoeia 1 solution (volume ratio 3:7) and adjusted in a vial for HPLC to a concentration of 0.05 mM. The test compound was measured by HPLC at 40° C. after 0 and 8 hours. The measurement value on 0 hour was defined as 100% to determine the remaining ratio of the test compound after 8 hours.\n\n\nThe “Japanese Pharmacopoeia 1 solution” here represents a solution in which 21 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added to 6 g of sodium chloride and further adjusted to 3 L with distilled water.\n\n\nThe results of the inhibitory effect on Ca\n2+\n entry in cells

in the compound of the present invention represented by the general formula [1] were, as shown in Tables 4 to 6, 0.024 nM, 0.038 nM, 0.24 nM, 0.019 nM, 0.66 nM, 0.15 nM, 0.14 nM, 0.038 nM, 0.54 nM and 0.69 nM, respectively, and the average value of IC\n50 \nof these ten compounds was 0.25 nM.\n\n\nParticularly the compounds of Examples 1-1, 1-2, 1-4 and 1-8 had values of IC\n50 \nof 0.024, 0.038, 0.019 and 0.038, respectively, and had an excellent inhibitory effect on VR1 activity.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the values of IC\n50 \nof the compounds of Comparative Examples 1 to 13 were, as shown in Tables 4 to 6, 3 nM, 1.3 nM, 18 nM, 5.2 nM, 42.0 nM, 0.3 nM, 0.4 nM, 7 nM, 0.12 nM, 0.04 nM, 0.36 nM, 0.03 nM and 0.12 nM, respectively, and the average value of IC\n50 \nof these thirteen compounds of Comparative Examples was 5.99 nM.\n\n\nAs described above, the compound of the present invention had inhibitory activity about 24 times those of the compounds of Comparative Examples in terms of the average values of IC\n50\n.\n\n\n[2] Discussion about Result of Metabolic Stability Test in Human Liver S9 (Test Example [2]);\n\n\nThe human liver S9 remaining ratios of the compounds of Examples 1-1 to 1-10 included in the compound of the present invention represented by the general formula [1] were, as shown in Tables 4 to 6, 90.8%, 65.3%, 59.6%, 39.7%, 82.2%, 91.8%, 50.4%, 91.5%, 77.3% and 92.2%, respectively, and the average human liver S9 remaining ratio of these ten compounds was 74%.\n\n\nParticularly the compounds of Examples 1-1, 1-6, 1-8 and 1-10 had 90% or higher remaining ratios and exhibited remarkably high remaining ratios, i.e., remarkably high metabolic stability in liver S9. Therefore, these compounds will be useful as drugs remarkably excellent in that they can resist oxidative metabolism and have the sustainability of the effect.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the human liver S9 remaining ratio of the compounds of Comparative Examples 1 to 13 were, as shown in Tables 4 to 6, 86.3%, 90.1%, 89.4%, 92.5%, 64.9%, 77.3%, 55.1%, 62.9%, 65.9%, 82.3%, 66.7%, 54.5% and 91.3%, respectively, and the average remaining ratio of these thirteen compounds of Comparative Examples was 75%.\n\n\n[3] Discussion about Result of In-Vitro Membrane Permeability Test (Test Example [3]);\n\n\nThe in-vitro membrane permeability of the compounds of Examples 1-1 to 1-10 included in the compound of the present invention represented by the general formula [1] was, as shown in Tables 4 to 6, 8.59×10\n−6\n, 20.96×10\n−6\n, 26.93×10\n−6\n, 30.25×10\n−6\n, 38.07×10\n−6\n, 37.53×10\n−6\n, 37.94×10\n−6\n, 13.61×10\n−6\n, 50.36×10\n−6 \nand 39.22×10\n−6\n, respectively, in terms of the Papp values (cm/sec.), and the average Papp value (cm/sec.) of these ten compounds was 30.35×10\n−6\n.\n\n\nParticularly the compounds of Examples 1-2 to 1-10 had 10×10\n−6 \n(cm/sec.) or more membrane permeability and exhibited remarkably high membrane permeability. Therefore, these compounds have exceedingly excellent properties as drugs because they have not only excellent values of IC\n50 \nbut also high absorbability which is a must for being practically used as a drug.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the Papp values (cm/sec.) of the compounds of Comparative Examples 1 to 13 were, as shown in Tables 4 to 6, 27.1×10\n−6\n, 24.2×10\n−6\n, 25.6×10\n−6\n, 5.3×10\n−6\n, 7.9×10\n−6\n, 21.1×10\n−6\n, 18.2×10\n−6\n, 43.1×10\n−6\n, 19.4×10\n−6\n, 6.7×10\n−6\n, 40.3×10\n−6\n, 10.4×10\n−6 \nand 28.6×10\n−6\n, respectively, and the average Papp value (cm/sec.) of these thirteen compounds of Comparative Examples was 21.38×10\n−6\n.\n\n\nAs described above, the compound of the present invention had membrane permeability about 1.4 times those of the compounds of Comparative Examples in terms of the average Papp values.\n\n\n[4] Discussion about Result of Stability Test in Japanese Pharmacopoeia 1 Solution (Test Example [4]);\n\n\nIn the stability test in Japanese Pharmacopoeia 1 solution, the remaining ratios of the compounds of Examples 1-6 and 1-8 included in the compound of the present invention represented by the general formula [1] were 100 and 101%, respectively. On the other hand, the remaining ratio of the compound of Comparative Example 13 was 62.1%.\n\n\nSince it is assumed that the Japanese Pharmacopoeia 1 solution has pH equal to that of gastric acid, it is generally known that stability therein suggests stability in gastric juice.\n\n\nTherefore, these compounds, as compared with the compound of Comparative Example 13, will be useful as drugs excellent in that they can be stable in gastric juice.\n\n\n[5] Summary;\n\n\n(1) Regarding Value of IC\n50\n;\n\n\nAccording to the document (J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2003 July; 306 (1): 377-86), it is known that BCTC, which is known as a substance inhibiting VR1 activity, has its inhibitory activity (value of IC\n50\n) of several nM. Moreover, we have also confirmed in our tests that the value of IC\n50 \nof BCTC is several nM.\n\n\nAll the values of IC\n50 \nof the compound of the present invention, specifically the compounds of the present Examples 1-1 to 1-10 are less than 1 nM.\n\n\nOn the other hand, of the compounds of Comparative Examples, seven compounds of Comparative Examples 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 had values of IC\n50 \nless than 1 nM. However, these seven compounds of Comparative Examples were not necessarily satisfiable with all things considered, for such reasons as they had remaining ratios less than 80% in the metabolic stability test in liver S9 and/or Papp values less than 10×10\n−6 \ncorresponding to membrane permeability or had inferior stability in gastric juice.\n\n\n(2) Regarding Metabolic Stability in Human Liver S9;\n\n\nMetabolic stability is one of important requirements for a drug, and those having 80% or higher metabolic stability are preferred. The compounds of Examples 1-1, 1-6, 1-8 and 1-10 had 90% or higher remaining ratios and exhibited remarkably high remaining ratios, i.e., remarkably high metabolic stability in liver S9.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the compounds of Comparative Examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 13, etc. also exhibited excellent metabolic stability. However, the compounds of Comparative Examples 1, 2, 3 and 4 had values of IC\n50 \nof 1 nM or higher and were not satisfiable in light of inhibitory activity. The compound of Comparative Example 10 had a Papp value of 6.7×10\n−6 \nand was not satisfiable in light of membrane permeability. Moreover, the compound of Comparative Example 13 had inferior stability in gastric juice and was not necessarily satisfiable.\n\n\n(3) Regarding Result of Membrane Permeability Test;\n\n\nRegarding membrane permeability, the compound of the present invention had membrane permeability about 1.4 times those of the compounds of Comparative Examples in terms of the average Papp values, as described above. Particularly the compounds of Examples 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 1-7, 1-9 and 1-10 had high membrane permeability of 30×10\n−6 \nor more in terms of the Papp values.\n\n\nOn the other hand, of the compounds of Comparative Examples, the compounds of Comparative Examples 8 and 11 had high membrane permeability. However, the compound of Comparative Example 8 had a value of IC\n50 \nof 7 nM corresponding to inhibitory activity and was not satisfiable in light of inhibitory activity. Moreover, the compound of Comparative Example 11 had a human liver S9 remaining ratio of 66.7% serving as an index of metabolic stability and was not necessarily satisfiable as a drug.\n\n\n(4) Characteristics of Compound of the Present Invention from the Viewpoint of Chemical Structure;\n\n\nWhen the compound of Comparative Example 11 and the compound of Example 1-2 are compared, they are different in that the former has only one fluorine atom in the phenyl group whereas the latter has two fluorine atoms. The latter has the value of IC\n50 \nabout 10 times higher than that of the former.\n\n\nWhen the compound of Comparative Example 8 and the compound of Example 1-6 are compared, they are different only in that the former has a trifluoromethyl group as a substituent for pyridine whereas the latter has a 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy group. The latter is improved in its liver S9 remaining ratio which is about 1.5 times that of the former and in its value of IC\n50 \nwhich is about 50 times that of the former.\n\n\nWhen the compounds of Comparative Examples 7 and 9 and the compound of Example 1-8 are compared, the compound of Example 1-8 which has two fluorine atoms and one 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy group as substituents for a phenyl group is different from the others in that the compound of Comparative Example 7 has only one trifluoromethyl group and in that the compound of Comparative Example 9 merely has one fluorine atom and one trifluoromethyl group. However, the compound of Example 1-8 is improved in its liver S9 remaining ratio which is about 1.4 to 1.7 times those of the compounds of Comparative Examples 7 and 9 and in its value of IC\n50 \nwhich is about 3 to 11 times those of the compounds of Comparative Examples 7 and 9.\n\n\nWhen the compound of Comparative Example 13 and the compound of Example 1-1 are compared, they are different in that the former has only one fluorine atom in the phenyl group whereas the latter has two fluorine atoms. The latter has the value of IC\n50 \nabout 5 times higher than that of the former. This was a result which was not expectable even by those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe compound represented by the general formula [1], particularly the compounds of Examples 1-1 to 1-10 are compounds having excellent inhibitory activity on VR1 as well as excellent metabolic stability in liver S9 and/or high membrane permeability.\n\n\nTherefore, the compounds of Examples 1-1 to 1-10 included in the compound represented by the general formula [1] not only are useful as drugs remarkably excellent in effectiveness as VR1 activity inhibitors but also will be useful as drugs remarkably excellent in that they can resist oxidative metabolism and have the sustainability of the effect as well as in that they can have high absorbability.\n\n\nTherefore, these compounds not only are useful as drugs remarkably excellent in effectiveness as VR1 activity inhibitors but also are expected to be practically used as drugs remarkably excellent in that they can resist oxidative metabolism and have the sustainability of the effect as well as in that they can have high absorbability.\n\n\nINDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY\n\n\nThe 3,4-dihydrobenzoxazine compound of the present invention effectively inhibits vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (VR1) activity, and therefore it is effective in the medical treatment and/or prevention of diseases such as pain, acute pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, rheumatoid arthritis pain, neuralgia, neuropathy, hyperalgesia, migraine, joint pain, acute herpetic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, chronic postherpetic neuralgia, postoperative pain, cancer pain, inflammatory pain, interstitial cystitis, posttraumatic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, neurodegenerative disease, cerebral apoplexy, ischemic symptom, nerve injury, neurogenic skin disorder, inflammatory disease, pruritus, allergic rhinitis, apoplexy, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dermatitis, mucositis, stomach and duodenal ulcer, inflammatory bowel disease, bladder hypersensitivity, overactive bladder type frequent urination, and overactive bladder type urinary incontinence."
