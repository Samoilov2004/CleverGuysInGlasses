GPCRs have usually seven transmembrane domains. Upon binding of a ligand to an extra-cellular portion or fragment of a GPCR, a signal is transduced within the cell that results in a change in a biological or physiological property or behaviour of the cell. GPCRs, along with G-proteins and effectors (intracellular enzymes and channels modulated by G-proteins), are the components of a modular signaling system that connects the state of intra-cellular second messengers to extra-cellular inputs.\n\n\nGPCR genes and gene products can modulate various physiological processes and are potential causative agents of disease. The GPCRs seem to be of critical importance to both the central nervous system and peripheral physiological processes.\n\n\nThe GPCR protein superfamily is represented in five families: Family I, receptors typified by rhodopsin and the beta2-adrenergic receptor and currently represented by over 200 unique members; Family II, the parathyroid hormone/calcitonin/secretin receptor family; Family III, the metabotropic glutamate receptor family, Family IV, the CAMP receptor family, important in the chemotaxis and development of \nD. discoideum\n; and Family V, the fungal mating pheromone receptor such as STE2.\n\n\nG proteins represent a family of heterotrimeric proteins composed of α, β and γ subunits, that bind guanine nucleotides. These proteins are usually linked to cell surface receptors (receptors containing seven transmembrane domains) for signal transduction. Indeed, following ligand binding to the GPCR, a conformational change is transmitted to the G protein, which causes the α-subunit to exchange a bound GDP molecule for a GTP molecule and to dissociate from the βγ-subunits.\n\n\nThe GTP-bound form of the α, β and γ-subunits typically functions as an effector-modulating moiety, leading to the production of second messengers, such as cAMP (e.g. by activation of adenyl cyclase), diacylglycerol or inositol phosphates.\n\n\nGreater than 20 different types of α-subunits are known in humans. These subunits associate with a small pool of β and γ subunits. Examples of mammalian G proteins include Gi, Go, Gq, Gs and Gt. G proteins are described extensively in Lodish et al., Molecular Cell Biology (Scientific American Books Inc., New York, N.Y., 1995; and also by Downes and Gautam, 1999, The G-Protein Subunit Gene Families. \nGenomics \n62:544-552), the contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nKnown and uncharacterized GPCRs currently constitute major targets for drug action and development. There are ongoing efforts to identify new G protein coupled receptors which can be used to screen for new agonists and antagonists having potential prophylactic and therapeutic properties.\n\n\nMore than 300 GPCRs have been cloned to date, excluding the family of olfactory receptors. Mechanistically, approximately 50-60% of all clinically relevant drugs act by modulating the functions of various GPCRs (Cudermann et al., \nJ. Mol. Med., \n73:51-63, 1995).\n\n\nChemerinR, also called Dez [Sequence ID Nos: 1 (human polynucleotide sequence, \nFIG. 1\n); 2 (human amino acid sequence, \nFIG. 2\n); 3 (mouse polynucleotide sequence, \nFIG. 3\n); 4 (mouse amino acid sequence, \nFIG. 3\n); 5 (rat polynucleotide sequence; \nFIG. 4\n); and 6 (rat amino acid sequence, \nFIG. 4\n)] has been described as an orphan G protein coupled receptor related to GPR-1 (38% overall amino acid identity), C3a receptor (38%), C5a anaphylatoxin receptor (36%) and formyl Met-Leu-Phe receptors (35%). ChemerinR is more distantly related to the chemokine receptors subfamily (Methner A, Hermey G, Schinke B, Hermans-Borgmeyer I. (1997) \nBiochem Biophys Res Commun \n233:336-42; Samson M, Edinger A L, Stordeur P, Rucker J, Verhasselt V, Sharron M, Govaerts C, Mollereau C, Vassart G, Doms R W, Parmentier M. (1998) \nEur J Immunol \n28:1689-700). ChemerinR transcripts were found to be abundant in monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages, with or without treatment with LPS. Low expression can also be detected by reverse transcription-PCR in CD4+ T lymphocytes. In situ hybridization experiments also showed that the receptor was differentially regulated during development, with a prominent expression in developing osseous and cartilaginous tissues. It was also detectable in the adult parathyroid glands, indicating a possible function in phosphocalic metabolism.\n\n\nThe gene encoding ChemerinR was assigned by radiation hybrid mapping to the g21.2-21.3 region of \nhuman chromosome\n 12, outside the gene clusters identified so far for chemoattractant receptors. ChemerinR was tested in fusion assays for potential coreceptor activity by a range of HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV viral strains. Several SIV strains (SIVmac316, SIVmac239, SIVmac17E-Fr and SIVsm62A), as well as a primary HIV-1 strain (92UG024-2) efficiently used ChemerinR as a co-receptor. This receptor therefore appears to be a coreceptor for immunodeficiency viruses that does not belong to the chemokine receptor family. It is also a putative chemoattractant receptor and it could play an important role in the recruitment or trafficking of leukocyte cell populations. ChemerinR, by its specific expression in macrophages and immature dendritic cells, appears as a particularly attractive candidate receptor involved in the initiation and early regulation of immune responses.\n\n\nTIG2 (Tazarotene-induced \ngene\n 2, thereafter Preprochemerin [Sequence ID Nos: 7 (human Preprochemerin polynucleotide sequence, \nFIG. 6\n); 8 (human amino acid sequence, \nFIG. 6\n); 9 (mouse polynucleotide sequence, \nFIG. 7\n); and 10 (mouse amino acid sequence, \nFIG. 7\n)] was identified as a cDNA, the expression of which is up-regulated by the treatment of skin raft cultures by the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) beta/gamma-selective anti-psoriatic synthetic retinoid, tazarotene [AGN 190168/ethyl 6-[2-(4,4-dimethylthiochroman-6-yl)-ethynyl]nicotinate] (Nagpal S, Patel S, Jacobe H, DiSepio D, Ghosn C, Malhotra M, Teng M, Duvic M, Chandraratna R A. (1997) \nJ Invest Dermatol \n109: 91-5). The retinoid-mediated up-regulation in the expression of Preprochemerin was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. The Preprochemerin is located at 17p13.3 position, a region associated with pancretic tumorigenesis. The Preprochemerin cDNA is 830 bp long and encodes a putative protein product of 163 amino acids. Preprochemerin is expressed and induced by tazarotene in culture only when keratinocytes and fibroblasts form a tissue-like 3-dimensional structure. RAR-specific retinoids were also shown to increase Preprochemerin mRNA levels. In contrast, neither RXR-specific retinoids nor 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increased Preprochemerin levels in these cells. Preprochemerin is also expressed at high levels in nonlesional psoriatic skin but at lower levels in the psoriatic lesion and its expression is up-regulated in psoriatic lesions after topical application of tazarotene. In addition, Preprochemerin has been shown to be dramatically upregulated by 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 and dexamethasone in osteoclast-supporting stromal cells (Adams A E, Abu-Amer Y, Chappel J, Stueckle S, Ross F P, Teitelbaum S L, Suva L J. (1999) \nJ Cell Biochem \n74: 587-95).\n\n\nDendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages are professional antigen-presenting cells that play key roles in both innate and adaptive immunity. DCs and macrophages are attracted to infection and inflammatory sites by a variety of factors, among which chemokines constitute the largest group so far (Caux, C. et al. (2002) \nTransplantation \n73: S7-S11, Mellman, I. and Steinman, R M (2001) \nCell \n106:255-258). It has been shown that tremendous functional, morphological and metabolic diversity exists among these cell populations. One of these functional differences is the expression of differential sets of chemoattractant receptors, which is responsible for the selective recruitment of specific cell subpopulations, according to their lineage, origin and maturation state (Caux, C. et al. (2002) \nTransplantation \n73: S7-S11). Many tumor types have been demonstrated to attract macrophages and DCs through the direct or indirect production of chemoattractant factors (Coussens, L M and Werb, Z. (2002) \nNature \n420:860-867, Vicari, A P and Caux, C. (2002) \nCytokine Growth Factors Rev. \n13:143-154). These include a number of CC-chemokines, such as MCP-1.\n\n\nDCs are specialized antigen-presenting cells located throughout the human body. DCs function as sentinels of the immune system. They serve as essential link between innate and adaptive immune systems and induce both primary and secondary immune responses (Palucka, K A and Banchereau, J. (1999) \nJ. Clin. Immunol. \n19:12-25). They traffic from the blood to the tissues where, while immature, they capture antigens. They then leave the tissues and move to the draining lymphoid organs where, coverted into mature DCs, they initiate the immune response by activating naïve CD8\n+\n cells, which seek out and kill the antigen-expressing tumor cells. Chemokines are important effectors of the regulation of DCs recruitment, and depending on the chemokine gradient released at the site of injury, different DC populations will be recruited. It is expected that the type of resulting immune response will likely be dependent on the DC subpopulation recruited and thus on the chemokines secreted (Caux, C. et al. (2002) \nTransplantation \n73: S7-S11).\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention is based on the discovery that Chemerin, a polypeptide resulting from the proteolytic processing of the Proprechemerin precursor, is a natural ligand of the ChemerinR, and binds specifically to ChemerinR.

The interaction is useful for screening assays for agents that modulate the interaction and thus the function of ChemerinR. The interaction between Chemerin and ChemerinR also provides for the diagnosis of conditions involving dysregulated receptor activity. The interaction also provides for therapeutic approaches for treatment of a disease or disorder.\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nFor convenience, the meaning of certain terms and phrases used in the specification, examples, and appended claims, are provided below.\n\n\nThe term “polypeptide” refers to a polymer in which the monomers are amino acids and are joined together through peptide or disulfide bonds. It also refers to either a full-length naturally-occurring amino acid sequence or a fragment thereof between about 8 and about 500 amino acids in length. Additionally, unnatural amino acids, for example, β-alanine, phenyl glycine and homoarginine may be included. Commonly-encountered amino acids which are not gene-encoded may also be used in the present invention. All of the amino acids used in the present invention may be either the D- or L-optical isomer. The L-isomers are preferred.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “ChemerinR polypeptide” refers to a polypeptide having two essential properties: 1) a ChemerinR polypeptide has at least 70% amino acid identity, and preferably 80%, 90%, 95% or higher, including 100% amino acid identity, to SEQ ID NO: 2; and 2) a ChemerinR polypeptide has ChemerinR activity, i.e., the polypeptide binds a Chemerin polypeptide or a functional fragment thereof. Optimally, a “ChemerinR polypeptide” also has ChemerinR signaling activity as defined herein.\n\n\nThe term “a Chemerin polypeptide” refers to a polypeptide having at least 30% or higher identity to a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 73, SEQ ID NO: 61 and SEQ ID Nos. 92-97, and the defined polypeptide specifically binds to and activates a signaling activity of a ChemerinR polypeptide. Preferrably, the polypeptide is at least 50%, or higher identity to a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 73, SEQ ID NO: 61 and SEQ ID Nos. 92-97. Preferrably, the polypeptide is at least 60%, or 70%, or 80%, or 85%, or higher identity to a polypeptide selected from the group consisting of: SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 73, SEQ ID NO: 61 and SEQ ID Nos. 92-97. The term “specifically binds” means that the Chemerin polypeptide has an EC\n50\n, IC\n50\n, or a K\nd \nof 100 nM or less. “Chemerin polypeptide” also refers to a fragment of a polypeptide meeting the preceding definition, wherein the fragment retains at least 50% of the binding activity and level of signaling activation of the full length polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 14. A Chemerin also includes a anolog, variant or some short polypeptide from C-terminal end of the Chemerin (SEQ ID NO 14) as depicted in \nFIGS. 8\n, and \n16\n, \n20\n \na \nand \n20\n \nb \nthat binds specifically to a ChemerinR polypeptide. A Chemerin polypeptide can comprise additions, insertions, deletions or substitutions relative to SEQ ID NO: 14, as long as the resulting polypeptide retains at least 50% of the binding activity and level of signaling activation of the full length polypeptide represented by SEQ ID NO: 14. In one embodiment, a “Chemerin polypeptide” encompasses further the truncated Preprochemerin sequence of SEQ ID NO: 73 shown in \nFIG. 16\n (the nucleotide sequence shown in \nFIG. 16\n, which encodes the truncated Preprochemerin polypeptide is SEQ ID NO: 72). In addition to the sequences necessary for binding to ChemerinR and activating a ChemerinR signaling activity, a Chemerin polypeptide, including the truncated Chemerin polypeptide can comprise additional sequences, as in for example, a Chemerin fusion protein. Non-limiting examples of fusion partners include glutathione-S-transferase (GST), maltose binding protein, alkaline phosphatase, thioredoxin, green fluorescent protein (GFP), histidine tags (e.g., 6× or greater His), or epitope tags (e.g., Myc tag, FLAG tag).\n\n\nThe term “a nucleic acid sequence” refers to a polynucleotides such DNA or RNA. The term should also include both single and doublestranded polynucleotides. The term should also be understood to include, as equivalents, analogs of either RNA or DNA made from nucleotide analogs, and, as applicable to the embodiment being described, single (sense or antisense) and double-stranded polynucleotides. ESTs, chromosomes, cDNAs, mRNAs, and rRNAs are representative examples of molecules that may be referred to as nucleic acids.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “Chemerin polynucleotide” refers to a polynucleotide that encodes a Chemerin polypeptide as defined herein, or the complement thereof. In one embodiment, a “Chemerin polynucleotide” is a polynucleotide sequence which encodes a truncated Preprochemerin polypeptide (e.g., the truncated Preprochemerin polypeptide shown in \nFIG. 17\n), such as the polynucleotide sequence shown in \nFIG. 17\n (SEQ ID NO: 49).\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “a ChemerinR polynucleotide” refers to a polynucleotide that encodes a ChemerinR polypeptide, or a ChemerinR polypeptide analog or variant as defined herein.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “standard” refers to a sample taken from an individual who is not affected by a disease or disorder characterized by dysregulation of G-protein coupled receptor (i.e., ChemerinR) activity. The “standard” is used as a reference for the comparison of receptor mRNA or polypeptide levels and quality (i.e., mutant vs. wild type), as well as for the comparison of G-protein coupled receptor activities. A “standard” also encompasses a reference sequence, e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1, with which sequences of nucleic acids or their encoded polypeptides are compared.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “dysregulation” refers to the signaling activity of ChemerinR in a sample wherein a) a 10% or greater increase or decrease in the amount of one or more of ChemerinR polypeptide, ligand or mRNA level is measured relative to a standard, as defined herein, in a given assay or; b) at least a single base pair change in the ChemerinR coding sequence is detected relative to SEQ ID NO: 1, and results in an alteration of ChemerinR ligand binding or signaling activity as defined in paragraphs a), c) or d) or; c) a 10% or greater increase or decrease in the amount of ChemerinR ligand binding activity is measured relative to a standard, as defined herein, in a given assay or; d) a 10% or greater increase or decrease in a second messenger, as defined herein, is measured relative to the standard, as defined herein, in a given assay.\n\n\nThe term “expression vector” refers to a nucleic acid construct capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are linked. The construct further includes regulatory sequences, including for example, a promoter, operably linked to the genes. In general, expressing vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of “plasmids” which refer generally to circular double stranded DNA loops which, in their vector form are not bound to chromosome.\n\n\nThe term “plasmid DNA expression vector” refers generally to a circular double stranded DNA loop which in their vector form are not bound to the chromosome, and which are capable of autonomous replication and/or expression of nucleic acids to which it is linked.\n\n\nThe term “adenovirus expression vector” refers to an expression vector which is derived from \nhuman adenovirus serotype\n 5, lacks ability to self-replicate, is capable of delivering into a cell a gene, and is capable of autonomous replication and/or expression of the gene inside the cell.\n\n\nThe term “composition” refers to a compound that is made of one or more molecules, preferably a protein or a nucleic acid encoding a protein, or a mixture thereof. A composition can be naturally occurring, or derived by recombinant technology, or by other synthetic means known to one skill in the art.\n\n\nThe term “therapeutic composition” refers to a composition that upon delivered into a cell, acts upon the cell to correct or compensate for an underlying molecular deficit, or counteract a disease state or syndrome of the cell.\n\n\nThe term “antibody” refers to the conventional immunoglobulin molecule, as well as fragments thereof which are also specifically reactive with one of the subject polypeptides. Antibodies can be fragmented using conventional techniques and the fragments screened for utility in the same manner as described herein below for whole antibodies. For example, F(ab)\n2 \nfragments can be generated by treating antibody with pepsin. The resulting F(ab)\n2 \nfragment can be treated to reduce disulfide bridges to produce Fab fragments. The antibody of the present invention is further intended to include bispecific, single-chain, and chimeric and humanized molecules having affinity for a polypeptide conferred by at least one CDR region of the antibody. In preferred embodiments, the antibodies, the antibody further comprises a label attached thereto and able to be detected, (e.g., the label can be a radioisotope, fluorescent compound, chemiluminescent compound, enzyme, or enzyme co-factor).\n\n\nThe term “monoclonal antibody” refers to an antibody that recognizes only one type of antigen. This type of antibodies is produced by the daughter cells of a single antibody-producing hybridoma.\n\n\nThe term “transgenic animal” refers to any animal, preferably a non-human mammal, bird, fish or an amphibian, in which one or more of the cells of the animal contain heterologous nucleic acid introduced by way of human intervention, such as by transgenic techniques well known in the art. The nucleic acid is introduced into the cell, directly or indirectly by introduction into a precursor of the cell, by way of deliberate genetic manipulation, such as by microinjection or by infection with a recombinant virus. The term genetic manipulation does not include classical cross-breeding, or in vitro fertilization, but rather is directed to the introduction of a recombinant DNA molecule. This molecule may be integrated within a chromosome, or it may be extra-chromosomally replicating DNA. In the typical transgenic animals described herein, the transgene causes cells to express a recombinant form of one of the subject polypeptide, e.g. either agonistic or antagonistic forms. However, transgenic animals in which the recombinant gene is silent are also contemplated, as for example, the FLP or CRE recombinase dependent constructs described below. Moreover, “transgenic animal” also includes those recombinant animals in which gene disruption of one or more genes is caused by human intervention, including both recombination and antisense techniques.\n\n\nThe term “therapeutically effective amount” refers to the total amount of each active component of the pharmaceutical composition or method that is sufficient to show a meaningful patient benefit, i.e., treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of the relevant medical condition, or an increase in rate of treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of such conditions. When applied to an individual active ingredient, administered alone, the term refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that results in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously. Generally, a composition will be administered in a single dosage in the range of 100 μg-100 mg/kg body weight, preferably in the range of 1 μg-100n/kg body weight. This dosage may be repeated daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or as considered appropriate by the treating physician.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “ChemerinR activity” refers to specific binding of a Chemerin polypeptide or a functional fragment thereof by a ChemerinR polypeptide.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “ChemerinR signaling activity” refers to the initiation or propagation of signaling by a ChemerinR polypeptide. ChemerinR signaling activity is monitored by measuring a detectable step in a signaling cascade by assaying one or more of the following: stimulation of GDP for GTP exchange on a G protein; alteration of adenylate cyclase activity; protein kinase C modulation; phosphatidylinositol breakdown (generating second messengers diacylglycerol, and inositol triphosphate); intracellular calcium flux; activation of MAP kinases; modulation of tyrosine kinases; or modulation of gene or reporter gene activity. A detectable step in a signaling cascade is considered initiated or mediated if the measurable activity is altered by 10% or more above or below a baseline established in the substantial absence of a Chemerin polypeptide relative to any of the ChemerinR activity assays described herein below. The measurable activity can be measured directly, as in, for example, measurement of cAMP or diacylglycerol levels. Alternatively, the measurable activity can be measured indirectly, as in, for example, a reporter gene assay.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “detectable step” refers to a step that can be measured, either directly, e.g., by measurement of a second messenger or detection of a modified (e.g., phosphorylated) protein, or indirectly, e.g., by monitoring a downstream effect of that step. For example, adenylate cyclase activation results in the generation of cAMP. The activity of adenylate cyclase can be measured directly, e.g., by an assay that monitors the production of cAMP in the assay, or indirectly, by measurement of actual levels of cAMP.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “isolated” refers to a population of molecules, e.g., polypeptides or polynucleotides, the composition of which is less than 50% (by weight), preferably less than 40% and most preferably 2% or less, contaminating molecules of an unlike nature. When the term “isolated” is applied to a ChemerinR polypeptide, it is specifically meant to encompass a ChemerinR polypeptide that is associated with or embedded in a lipid membrane.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “candidate compound” and “candidate modulator” refer to a composition being evaluated for the ability to modulate ligand binding to a ChemerinR polypeptide or the ability to modulate an activity of a ChemerinR polypeptide. Candidate modulators can be natural or synthetic compounds, including, for example, small molecules, compounds contained in extracts of animal, plant, bacterial or fungal cells, as well as conditioned medium from such cells.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “small molecule” refers to a compound having molecular mass of less than 3000 Daltons, preferably less than 2000 or 1500, still more preferably less than 1000, and most preferably less than 600 Daltons. A “small organic molecule” is a small molecule that comprises carbon.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “change in binding” or “change in activity” and the equivalent terms “difference in binding” or “difference in activity” refer to an at least 10% increase or decrease in binding, or signaling activity in a given assay.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “conditions permitting the binding of Chemerin to ChemerinR” refers to conditions of, for example, temperature, salt concentration, pH and protein concentration under which Chemerin binds ChemerinR. Exact binding conditions will vary depending upon the nature of the assay, for example, whether the assay uses viable cells or only membrane fraction of cells. However, because ChemerinR is a cell surface protein, and because Chemerin is a secreted polypeptide that interacts with ChemerinR on the cell surface, favored conditions will generally include physiological salt (90 mM) and pH (about 7.0 to 8.0). Temperatures for binding can vary from 15° C. to 37° C., but will preferably be between room temperature and about 30° C. The concentration of Chemerin and ChemerinR polypeptide in a binding reaction will also vary, but will preferably be about 0.1 pM (e.g., in a reaction with radiolabeled tracer Chemerin, where the concentration is generally below the K\nd\n) to 1 (e.g., Chemerin as competitor). As an example, for a binding assay using ChemerinR-expressing cells and purified, recombinant, labeled Chemerin polypeptide, binding is performed using 0.1 nM labeled Chemerin, 100 nM cold Chemerin, and 25,000 cells at 27° C. in 250 μl of a binding buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mM CaCl\n2\n, and 0.5% Fatty acid free BSA.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “sample” refers to the source of molecules being tested for the presence of an agent that modulates binding to or signaling activity of a ChemerinR polypeptide. A sample can be an environmental sample, a natural extract of animal, plant yeast or bacterial cells or tissues, a clinical sample, a synthetic sample, or a conditioned medium from recombinant cells or a fermentation process. The term “tissue sample” refers to a tissue that is tested for the presence, abundance, quality or an activity of a ChemerinR polypeptide, a Chemerin polypeptide, a nucleic acid encoding a ChemerinR or Chemerin polypeptide, or an agent that modifies the ligand binding or activity of a ChemerinR polypeptide.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “tissue” is an aggregate of cells that perform a particular function in an organism. The term “tissue” as used herein refers to cellular material from a particular physiological region. The cells in a particular tissue can comprise several different cell types. A non-limiting example of this would be brain tissue that further comprises neurons and glial cells, as well as capillary endothelial cells and blood cells, all contained in a given tissue section or sample. In addition to solid tissues, the term “tissue” is also intended to encompass non-solid tissues, such as blood.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “membrane fraction” refers to a preparation of cellular lipid membranes comprising a ChemerinR polypeptide. As the term is used herein, a “membrane fraction” is distinct from a cellular homogenate, in that at least a portion (i.e., at least 10%, and preferably more) of non-membrane-associated cellular constituents has been removed. The term “membrane associated” refers to those cellular constituents that are either integrated into a lipid membrane or are physically associated with a component that is integrated into a lipid membrane.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “decrease in binding” refers to a decrease of at least 10% in the binding of a Chemerin polypeptide or other agonist to a ChemerinR polypeptide as measured in a binding assay as described herein.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “second messenger” refers to a molecule, generated or caused to vary in concentration by the activation of a G-Protein Coupled Receptor, that participates in the transduction of a signal from that GPCR. Non-limiting examples of second messengers include cAMP, diacylglycerol, inositol triphosphates and intracellular calcium. The term “change in the level of a second messenger” refers to an increase or decrease of at least 10% in the detected level of a given second messenger relative to the amount detected in an assay performed in the absence of a candidate modulator.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “aequorin-based assay” refers to an assay for GPCr activity that measures intracellular calcium flux induced by activated GPCRs, wherein intracellular calcium flux is measured by the luminescence of aequorin expressed in the cell.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “binding” refers to the physical association of a ligand (e.g., a Chemerin polypeptide) with a receptor (e.g., ChemerinR). As the term is used herein, binding is “specific” if it occurs with an EC\n50 \nor a K\nd \nof 100 nM or less, generally in the range of 100 nM to 10 pM. For example, binding is specific if the EC\n50 \nor K\nd \nis 100 nM, 50 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 950 pM, 900 pM, 850 pM, 800 pM, 750 pM, 700 pM, 650 pM, 600 pM, 550 pM, 500 pM, 450 pM, 400 pM, 350 pM, 300 pM, 250 pM, 200 pM, 150 pM, 100 pM, 75 pM, 50 pM, 25 pM or 10 pM or less.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “EC\n50\n,” refers to that concentration of an agent at which a given activity, including binding of a Chemerin polypeptide or other ligand and a functional activity of a ChemerinR polypeptide, is 50% of the maximum for that ChemerinR activity measurable using the same assay. Stated differently, the “EC\n50\n” is the concentration of agent that gives 50% activation, when 100% activation is set at the amount of activity that does not increase with the addition of more agonist. It should be noted that the “EC\n50 \nof a Chemerin polypeptide” will vary with the identity of the Chemerin polypeptide; for example, variant Chemerin polypeptides (i.e., those containing insertions, deletions, substitutions or fusions with other polypeptides, including Chemerin molecules from species other than humans and variants of them that satisfy the definition of Chemerin polypeptide set forth above) can have EC\n50 \nvalues higher than, lower than or the same as wild-type Chemerin. Therefore, where a Chemerin variant sequence differs from wild-type Chemerin of SEQ ID NO:8, one of the skill in the art can determine the EC\n50 \nfor that variant according to conventional methods. The EC\n50 \nof a given Chemerin polypeptide is measured by performing an assay for an activity of a fixed amount of ChemerinR polypeptide in the presence of doses of the Chemerin polypeptide that increase at least until the ChemerinR response is saturated or maximal, and then plotting the measured ChemerinR activity versus the concentration of Chemerin polypeptide.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “IC\n50\n” is the concentration of an antagonist or inverse agonist that reduces the maximal activation of a ChemerinR receptor by 50%.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “detectably labeled” refers to the property of a molecule, e.g., a Chemerin polypeptide or other ChemerinR ligand, that has a structural modification that incorporates a functional group (label) that can be readily detected. Detectable labels include but are not limited to fluorescent compounds, isotopic compounds, chemiluminescent compounds, quantum dot labels, biotin, enzymes, electron-dense reagents, and haptens or proteins for which antisera or monoclonal antibodies are available. The various means of detection include but are not limited to spectroscopic, photochemical, radiochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, or chemical means.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “affinity tag” refers to a label, attached to a molecule of interest (e.g., a Chemerin polypeptide or other ChemerinR ligand), that confers upon the labeled molecule the ability to be specifically bound by a reagent that binds the label. Affinity tags include, but are not limited to an epitope for an antibody (known as “epitope tags”), biotin, 6×His, and GST. Affinity tags can be used for the detection, as well as for the purification of the labeled species.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “decrease in binding” refers to a decrease of at least 10% in the amount of binding detected in a given assay with a known or suspected modulator of ChemerinR relative to binding detected in an assay lacking that known or suspected modulator.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “delivering,” when used in reference to a drug or agent, means the addition of the drug or agent to an assay mixture, or to a cell in culture. The term also refers to the administration of the drug or agent to an animal. Such administration can be, for example, by injection (in a suitable carrier, e.g., sterile saline or water) or by inhalation, or by an oral, transdermal, rectal, vaginal, or other common route of drug administration.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “effective amount” refers to that amount of a drug or ChemerinR modulating agent that results in a change in a ChemerinR activity as defined herein (i.e., at least 10% increase or decrease in a ChemerinR activity).\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “amplifying,” when applied to a nucleic acid sequence, refers to a process whereby one or more copies of a nucleic acid sequence is generated from a template nucleic acid. A preferred method of “amplifying” is PCR or RT/PCR.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “substantial absence” refers to a level of an activating or inhibiting factor that is below the level necessary to activate or inhibit GPCR function by at least 10% as measured by a given assay disclosed herein or known in the art.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “G-Protein coupled receptor,” or “GPCR” refers to a membrane-associated polypeptide with 7 alpha helical transmembrane domains. Functional GPCR's associate with a ligand or agonist and also associate with and activate G-proteins. ChemerinR is a GPCR.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “agent that modulates the function of a ChemerinR polypeptide” is a molecule or compound that increases or decreases ChemerinR activity, including compounds that change the binding of Chemerin polypeptides or other agonists, and compounds that change ChemerinR downstream signaling activities.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “null mutation” refers to an insertion, deletion, or substitution that modifies the chromosomal sequences encoding a polypeptide, such that the polypeptide is not expressed.\n\n\nI. Assays for the Identification of Agents that Modulate the Activity of ChemerinR\n\n\nAgents that modulate the activity of ChemerinR can be identified in a number of ways that take advantage of the interaction of the receptor with Chemerin. For example, the ability to reconstitute ChemerinR/Chemerin binding either in vitro, on cultured cells or in vivo provides a target for the identification of agents that disrupt that binding. Assays based on disruption of binding can identify agents, such as small organic molecules, from libraries or collections of such molecules. Alternatively, such assays can identify agents in samples or extracts from natural sources, e.g., plant, fungal or bacterial extracts or even in human tissue samples (e.g., tumor tissue). In one aspect, the extracts can be made from cells expressing a library of variant nucleic acids, peptides or polypeptides, including, for example, variants of Chemerin polypeptide itself. Modulators of ChemerinR/Chemerin binding can then be screened using a binding assay or a functional assay that measures downstream signaling through the receptor. Both binding assays and functional assays are validated using Chemerin polypeptide.\n\n\nAnother approach that uses the ChemerinR/Chemerin interaction more directly to identify agents that modulate ChemerinR function measures changes in ChemerinR downstream signaling induced by candidate agents or candidate modulators. These functional assays can be performed in isolated cell membrane fractions or on cells expressing the receptor on their surfaces.\n\n\nA. ChemerinR polypeptides.\n\n\nAssays using the interaction of ChemerinR and Chemerin require a source of ChemerinR polypeptide. The polynucleotide and polypeptide sequence of human ChemerinR are presented herein as SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2. The human ChemerinR polynucleotide sequence is also available at GenBank Accession No. Y14838, and was reported in Samson et al., 1998, Eur. J. Immunol. 28: 1689-1700, incorporated herein by reference. ChemerinR polypeptide sequence is also recorded at accession Nos. O75748 and CAA75112 in the Swissprot database. Related sequences include those for CMKRL1 (GenBank Accession Nos. XM\n—\n006864 and NM004072 (nucleotide sequences) and Swissprot Accession No. Q99788 (polypeptide sequence)), human DEZb (GenBank Accession No. U79527 (nucleotide sequence)), human DEZa (GenBank Accession No. U79526 (nucleotide sequence), mouse DEZ (GenBank Accession No. U79525 (nucleotide sequence) and Swissprot Accession No. P97468 (polypeptide sequence)), and rat ChemerinR (GenBank Accession No. AJ002745 (nucleotide sequence) and Swissprot Accession No. O35786 (polypeptide sequence).\n\n\nOne skilled in the art can readily amplify a ChemerinR sequence from a sample containing mRNA encoding the protein through basic PCR and molecular cloning techniques using primers or probes designed from the known sequences.\n\n\nThe expression of recombinant polypeptides is well known in the art. Those skilled in the art can readily select vectors and expression control sequences for the expression of ChemerinR polypeptides useful according to the invention in eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells. ChemerinR must be associated with cell membrane or detergents like synthetic liposomes in order to have binding or signaling function. Methods for the preparation of cellular membrane fractions are well known in the art, e.g., the method reported by Hubbard & Cohn, 1975, J. Cell Biol. 64: 461-479, which is incorporated herein by reference. In order to produce membranes comprising ChemerinR, one need only apply such techniques to cells endogenously or recombinantly expressing ChemerinR. Alternatively, membrane-free ChemerinR can be integrated into membrane preparations by dilution of detergent solution of the polypeptide (see, e.g., Salamon et al., 1996, Biophys. J. 71:283-294, which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nB. Chemerin Polypeptides.\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a Chemerin polypeptide including the full-length active form and the truncated Chemerin polypeptides. The 163 amino acid full-length Preprochemerin polypeptide is first produced in a cell as inactive form (\nFIG. 6\n). This inactive form of Chemerin is converted into the active form of Chemerin (137 amino acids) by the following two steps: a) removing 20 amino acids at N-terminus (this form is called prochemerin, 143 amino acids, Fibure 8); b) removing 6 amino acids at C-terminus (137 amino acids, \nFIG. 9\n). Preferably, the C-terminus human truncated Preprochemerin and chemerin polypeptides are presented in \nFIGS. 16\n, \n8\n and \n20\n \na \n(human chemerin −9, −10, −11, −12, −13, −19) respectively. The Chemerin polypeptides of the invention may be a recombinant Chemerin polypeptide, a natural Chemerin polypeptide, or a synthetic Chemerin polypeptide, preferably a recombinant Chemerin polypeptide. The Chemerin polypeptide of the invention may also encompass the analogs or variants whose polypeptide sequences are different from the naturally-occurring ones, but retain substantially the same function or activity as a Chemerin polypeptide.\n\n\nThe full-length human inactive Preprochemerin polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences are presented herein as \n \nSEQ ID Nos\n \n 7 and 8, respectively (\nFIG. 6\n). Preprochemerin sequences are also available from GenBank (e.g., Human polynucleotide sequences include Accession Nos. XM 004765, U77594, NM 002889, human polypeptide sequence is available at Accession Nos. Q99969, BAA76499, AAB47975, NP002880, and XP004765; \nGallus gallus \npolynucleotide sequences include Accession Nos. BG713704, BG713660 and BG713614; mouse polynucleotide sequences include BF020273, AW113641 and bf018000; rat polynucleotide sequences include AW915104; \nSus scrofa \npolynucleotide sequences include BF078978 and BF713092 (overlapping ESTs, last 7 amino acids of Preprochemerin sequence in BF713092); and \nBos taurus \npolynucleotide sequences include BG691132). An alignment of Preprochemerin sequences is presented in \nFIG. 11\n.\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a Chemerin polypeptide. The nucleic acid sequences of the invention may also contain the coding sequences fused in frame to a marker sequence for purification of the polypeptides of the present invention. The nucleic acid sequences of the present invention may be employed for producing polypeptides of the present invention by recombinant techniques. The nucleic acid sequences of the invention may be included in any one of the expressing vectors such as plasmid DNA, phage DNA, or Viral DNA vectors etc, all vectors are well known in the art.\n\n\nAs with ChemerinR, Chemerin polynucleotides can be cloned through standard PCR and molecular cloning techniques using the known sequences as a source of amplification primers or probes. Similarly, cloned Chemerin polypeptides can be expressed in eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells as known in the art. As a non-limiting example, Chemerin may be cloned into an acceptable mammalian expression vector, such as pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) for expression in a host cell. A Chemerin expression construct for expression in yeast is described in Example 4.\n\n\nChemerin can also be expressed in vitro through in vitro transcription and translation. Further, if desired for a given assay or technique, Chemerin polypeptides useful according to the invention can be produced as fusion proteins or tagged proteins. For example, either full length Chemerin or a portion thereof (i.e., at least 10 amino acids, preferably at least 20 amino acids or more, up to one amino acid less than full length Chemerin) can be fused to Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST), secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), a FLAG tag, a Myc tag, or a 6×-His peptide to facilitate the purification or detection of the Chemerin polypeptide. Methods and vectors for the production of tagged or fusion proteins are well known in the art, as are methods of isolating and detecting such fused or tagged proteins.\n\n\nRecombinant Chemerin polypeptides can be used in purified form. Alternatively, conditioned medium from Chemerin transfected cells can be used. The amounts of Chemerin necessary in a given binding or functional assay according to the invention will vary depending upon the assay, but will generally use 1 pM to 1 nM of labeled and 10 pM to 1 μm of unlabeled Chemerin per assay. The affinities and EC\n50\ns of tagged Chemerin polypeptides for ChemerinR may vary relative to those of full length wild type Chemerin polypeptide, and the amount necessary for a given assay can therefore be adjusted relative to the wild-type values. If necessary for a given assay, Chemerin can be labeled by incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids in the medium during synthesis, e.g., \n35\nS-Met, \n14\nC-Leu, tritium H3 or others as appropriate. Methods of chemical labeling with \n125\nI are known in the art. Fluorescent labels can also be attached to Chemerin polypeptides or to other ChemerinR ligands using standard labeling techniques.\n\n\nThe Chemerin polypeptides may also be employed for treatment of a disease or disorder. For example, cells from a patient may be engineered with a polynucleotide (DNA or RNA) encoding a polypeptide ex vivo, with the engineered cells then being provided to a patient to be treated with the polypeptide. Such methods are well-known in the art. Similarly, cells may be engineered in vivo for expression of a polypeptide in vivo by, for example, procedures known in the art. These and other methods for administering a polypeptide of the present invention by such method should be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings of the present invention. For example, the expression vector for engineering cells in vivo may be a retrovirus, an adenovirus, or a non-viral vectors.\n\n\nC. Assays to Identify Modulators of ChemerinR Activity\n\n\nThe discovery that Chemerin is a ligand of the ChemerinR receptor permits screening assays to identify agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists of receptor activity. The screening assays will have two general approaches.\n\n\n1) Ligand binding assays, in which cells expressing ChemerinR, membrane extracts from such cells, or immobilized lipid membranes comprising ChemerinR are exposed to a labeled Chemerin polypeptide and candidate compound. Following incubation, the reaction mixture is measured for specific binding of the labeled Chemerin polypeptide to the ChemerinR receptor. Compounds that interfere with or displace labeled Chemerin polypeptide can be agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists of ChemerinR activity. Functional analysis can be performed on positive compounds to determine which of these categories they fit.\n\n\n2) Functional assays, in which a signaling activity of ChemerinR is measured.\n\n\na) For agonist screening, cells expressing ChemerinR or membranes prepared from them are incubated with candidate compound, and a signaling activity of ChemerinR is measured. The assays are validated using a Chemerin polypeptide as agonist, and the activity induced by compounds that modulate receptor activity is compared to that induced by Chemerin. An agonist or partial agonist will have a maximal biological activity corresponding to at least 10% of the maximal activity of wild type human Chemerin when the agonist or partial agonist is present at 10 μM or less, and preferably will have 50%, 75%, 100% or more, including 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold or more activity than wild-type human Chemerin.\n\n\nb) For antagonist or inverse agonist screening, cells expressing ChemerinR or membranes isolated from them are assayed for signaling activity in the presence of a Chemerin polypeptide with or without a candidate compound. Antagonists or inverse agonists will reduce the level of Chemerin-stimulated receptor activity by at least 10%, relative to reactions lacking the antagonist or inverse agonist.\n\n\nc) For inverse agonist screening, cells expressing constitutive ChemerinR activity or membranes isolated from them are used in a functional assay that measures an activity of the receptor in the presence and absence of a candidate compound. Inverse agonists are those compounds that reduce the constitutive activity of the receptor by at least 10%. Overexpression of ChemerinR (i.e., expression of 5-fold or higher excess of ChemerinR polypeptide relative to the level naturally expressed in macro phages in vivo) may lead to constitutive activation. ChememerinR can be overexpressed by placing it under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, e.g., the CMV early promoter. Alternatively, certain mutations of conserved GPCR amino acids or amino acid domains tend to lead to constitutive activity. See for example: Kjelsberg et al., 1992, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n267:1430; McWhinney et al., 2000. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n275:2087; Ren et al., 1993, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n268:16483; Samama et al., 1993, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n268:4625; Parma et al., 1993, \nNature \n365:649; Parma et al., 1998, \nJ. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. \n286:85; and Parent et al., 1996, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n271:7949.\n\n\nLigand Binding and Displacement Assays:\n\n\nOne can use ChemerinR polypeptides expressed on a cell, or isolated membranes containing receptor polypeptides, along with a Chemerin polypeptide in order to screen for compounds that inhibit the binding of Chemerin to ChemerinR. When identified in an assay that measures binding or Chemerin polypeptide displacement alone, compounds will have to be subjected to functional testing to determine whether they act as agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists.\n\n\nFor displacement experiments, cells expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide (generally 25,000 cells per assay or 1 to 100 μg of membrane extracts) are incubated in binding buffer (e.g., 50 mM Hepes pH 7.4; 1 mM CaCl\n2\n; 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) Fatty Acid-Free; and 0 5 mM MgCl\n2\n) for 1.5 hrs (at, for example, 27° C.) with labeled Chemerin polypeptide in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of a candidate modulator. To validate and calibrate the assay, control competition reactions using increasing concentrations of unlabeled Chemerin polypeptide can be performed. After incubation, cells are washed extensively, and bound, labeled Chemerin is measured as appropriate for the given label (e.g., scintillation counting, enzyme assay, fluorescence, etc.). A decrease of at least 10% in the amount of labeled Chemerin polypeptide bound in the presence of candidate modulator indicates displacement of binding by the candidate modulator. Candidate modulators are considered to bind specifically in this or other assays described herein if they displace 50% of labeled Chemerin (sub-saturating Chemerin dose) at a concentration of 10 μM or less (i.e., EC\n50 \nis 10 μM or less).\n\n\nAlternatively, binding or displacement of binding can be monitored by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Surface plasmon resonance assays can be used as a quantitative method to measure binding between two molecules by the change in mass near an immobilized sensor caused by the binding or loss of binding of a Chemerin polypeptide from the aqueous phase to a ChemerinR polypeptide immobilized in a membrane on the sensor. This change in mass is measured as resonance units versus time after injection or removal of the Chemerin polypeptide or candidate modulator and is measured using a Biacore Biosensor (Biacore AB). ChemerinR can be immobilized on a sensor chip (for example, research grade CM5 chip; Biacore AB) in a thin film lipid membrane according to methods described by Salamon et al. (Salamon et al., 1996, Biophys J. 71: 283-294; Salamon et al., 2001, Biophys. J. 80: 1557-1567; Salamon et al., 1999, Trends Biochem. Sci. 24: 213-219, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.). Sarrio et al. demonstrated that SPR can be used to detect ligand binding to the GPCR A(1) adenosine receptor immobilized in a lipid layer on the chip (Sarrio et al., 2000, Mol. Cell. Biol. 20: 5164-5174, incorporated herein by reference). Conditions for Chemerin binding to ChemerinR in an SPR assay can be fine-tuned by one of skill in the art using the conditions reported by Sarrio et al. as a starting point.\n\n\nSPR can assay for modulators of binding in at least two ways. First, a Chemerin polypeptide can be pre-bound to immobilized ChemerinR polypeptide, followed by injection of candidate modulator at approximately 10 μl/min flow rate and a concentration ranging from 1 nM to 100 μM, preferably about 1 μM. Displacement of the bound Chemerin can be quantitated, permitting detection of modulator binding. Alternatively, the membrane-bound ChemerinR polypeptide can be pre-incubated with candidate modulator and challenged with a Chemerin polypeptide. A difference in Chemerin binding to the ChemerinR exposed to modulator relative to that on a chip not pre-exposed to modulator will demonstrate binding. In either assay, a decrease of 10% or more in the amount of a Chemerin polypeptide bound is in the presence of candidate modulator, relative to the amount of a Chemerin polypeptide bound in the absence of candidate modulator indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits the interaction of ChemerinR and Chemerin.\n\n\nAnother method of measuring inhibition of binding of a Chemerin polypeptide to ChemerinR uses fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). FRET is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that occurs between a fluorescence donor (D) and a fluorescence acceptor (A) in close proximity to each other (usually <100 A of separation) if the emission spectrum of D overlaps with the excitation spectrum of A. The molecules to be tested, e.g., a Chemerin polypeptide and a ChemerinR polypeptide, are labeled with a complementary pair of donor and acceptor fluorophores. While bound closely together by the ChemerinR:Chemerin interaction, the fluorescence emitted upon excitation of the donor fluorophore will have a different wavelength than that emitted in response to that excitation wavelength when the polypeptides are not bound, providing for quantitation of bound versus unbound polypeptides by measurement of emission intensity at each wavelength. Donor:Acceptor pairs of fluorophores with which to label the polypeptides are well known in the art. Of particular interest are variants of the \nA. victoria \nGFP known as Cyan FP(CFP, Donor(D)) and Yellow FP (YFP, Acceptor(A)). The GFP variants can be made as fusion proteins with the respective members of the binding pair to serve as D-A pairs in a FRET scheme to measure protein-protein interaction. Vectors for the expression of GFP variants as fusions are known in the art. As an example, a CFP-Chemerin fusion and a YFP-ChemerinR fusion can be made. The addition of a candidate modulator to the mixture of labeled Chemerin and ChemerinR proteins will result in an inhibition of energy transfer evidenced by, for example, a decrease in YFP fluorescence relative to a sample without the candidate modulator. In an assay using FRET for the detection of ChemerinR:Chemerin interaction, a 10% or greater decrease in the intensity of fluorescent emission at the acceptor wavelength in samples containing a candidate modulator, relative to samples without the candidate modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits ChemerinR:Chemerin interaction.\n\n\nA variation on FRET uses fluorescence quenching to monitor molecular interactions. One molecule in the interacting pair can be labeled with a fluorophore, and the other with a molecule that quenches the fluorescence of the fluorophore when brought into close apposition with it. A change in fluorescence upon excitation is indicative of a change in the association of the molecules tagged with the fluorophore:quencher pair. Generally, an increase in fluorescence of the labeled ChemerinR polypeptide is indicative that the Chemerin polypeptide bearing the quencher has been displaced. For quenching assays, a 10% or greater increase in the intensity of fluorescent emission in samples containing a candidate modulator, relative to samples without the candidate modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits ChemerinR:Chemerin interaction.\n\n\nIn addition to the surface plasmon resonance and FRET methods, fluorescence polarization measurement is useful to quantitate protein-protein binding. The fluorescence polarization value for a fluorescently-tagged molecule depends on the rotational correlation time or tumbling rate. Protein complexes, such as those formed by ChemerinR associating with a fluorescently labeled Chemerin polypeptide, have higher polarization values than uncomplexed, labeled Chemerin. The inclusion of a candidate inhibitor of the ChemerinR:Chemerin interaction results in a decrease in fluorescence polarization, relative to a mixture without the candidate inhibitor, if the candidate inhibitor disrupts or inhibits the interaction of ChemerinR with Chemerin. Fluorescence polarization is well suited for the identification of small molecules that disrupt the formation of polypeptide or protein complexes. A decrease of 10% or more in fluorescence polarization in samples containing a candidate modulator, relative to fluorescence polarization in a sample lacking the candidate modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits ChemerinR:Chemerin interaction.\n\n\nAnother alternative for monitoring ChemerinR:Chemerin interactions uses a biosensor assay. ICS biosensors have been described by AMBRI (Australian Membrane Biotechnology Research Institute; http//www.ambri.com.au/). In this technology, the association of macromolecules such as ChemerinR and Chemerin, is coupled to the closing of gramacidin-facilitated ion channels in suspended membrane bilayers and thus to a measurable change in the admittance (similar to impedence) of the biosensor. This approach is linear over six orders of magnitude of admittance change and is ideally suited for large scale, high throughput screening of small molecule combinatorial libraries. A 10% or greater change (increase or decrease) in admittance in a sample containing a candidate modulator, relative to the admittance of a sample lacking the candidate modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits the interaction of ChemerinR and Chemerin.\n\n\nIt is important to note that in assays of protein-protein interaction, it is possible that a modulator of the interaction need not necessarily interact directly with the domain(s) of the proteins that physically interact. It is also possible that a modulator will interact at a location removed from the site of protein-protein interaction and cause, for example, a conformational change in the ChemerinR polypeptide. Modulators (inhibitors or agonists) that act in this manner are nonetheless of interest as agents to modulate the activity of ChemerinR.\n\n\nIt should be understood that any of the binding assays described herein can be performed with a non-Chemerin ligand (for example, agonist, antagonist, etc.) of ChemerinR, e.g., a small molecule identified as described herein. In practice, the use of a small molecule ligand or other non-Chemerin ligand has the benefit that non-polypeptide chemical compounds are generally cheaper and easier to produce in purified form than polypeptides such as Chemerin. Thus, a non-Chemerin ligand is better suited to high-throughput assays for the identification of agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists than full length Chemerin. This advantage in no way erodes the importance of assays using Chemerin, however, as such assays are well suited for the initial identification of non-Chemerin ligands.\n\n\nAny of the binding assays described can be used to determine the presence of an agent in a sample, e.g., a tissue sample, that binds to the ChemerinR receptor molecule, or that affects the binding of Chemerin to the receptor. To do so, ChemerinR polypeptide is reacted with Chemerin polypeptide or another ligand in the presence or absence of the sample, and Chemerin or ligand binding is measured as appropriate for the binding assay being used. A decrease of 10% or more in the binding of Chemerin or other ligand indicates that the sample contains an agent that modulates Chemerin or ligand binding to the receptor polypeptide.\n\n\nFunctional Assays of Receptor Activity\n\n\ni. GTPase/GTP Binding Assays:\n\n\nFor GPCRs such as ChemerinR, a measure of receptor activity is the binding of GTP by cell membranes containing receptors. In the method described by Traynor and Nahorski, 1995, Mol. Pharmacol. 47: 848-854, incorporated herein by reference, one essentially measures G-protein coupling to membranes by measuring the binding of labeled GTP. For GTP binding assays, membranes isolated from cells expressing the receptor are incubated in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 80 pM \n35\nS-GTPγS and 3 μM GDP. The assay mixture is incubated for 60 minutes at 30° C., after which unbound labeled GTP is removed by filtration onto GF/B filters. Bound, labeled GTP is measured by liquid scintillation counting. In order to assay for modulation of Chemerin-induced ChemerinR activity, membranes prepared from cells expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide are mixed with a Chemerin polypeptide, and the GTP binding assay is performed in the presence and absence of a candidate modulator of ChemerinR activity. A decrease of 10% or more in labeled GTP binding as measured by scintillation counting in an assay of this kind containing candidate modulator, relative to an assay without the modulator, indicates that the candidate modulator inhibits ChemerinR activity.\n\n\nA similar GTP-binding assay can be performed without Chemerin to identify compounds that act as agonists. In this case, Chemerin-stimulated GTP binding is used as a standard. A compound is considered an agonist if it induces at least 50% of the level of GTP binding induced by full length wild-type Chemerin when the compound is present at 1 μM or less, and preferably will induce a level the same as or higher than that induced by Chemerin.\n\n\nGTPase activity is measured by incubating the membranes containing a ChemerinR polypeptide with γ\n32\nP-GTP. Active GTPase will release the label as inorganic phosphate, which is detected by separation of free inorganic phosphate in a 5% suspension of activated charcoal in 20 mM H\n3\nPO\n4\n, followed by scintillation counting. Controls include assays using membranes isolated from cells not expressing ChemerinR (mock-transfected), in order to exclude possible non-specific effects of the candidate compound.\n\n\nIn order to assay for the effect of a candidate modulator on ChemerinR-regulated GTPase activity, membrane samples are incubated with a Chemerin polypeptide, with and without the modulator, followed by the GTPase assay. A change (increase or decrease) of 10% or more in the level of GTP binding or GTPase activity relative to samples without modulator is indicative of ChemerinR modulation by a candidate modulator.\n\n\nii. Downstream Pathway Activation Assays:\n\n \n \n \n \na. Calcium flux—The Aequorin-based Assay.\n \n \n \n\n\nThe aequorin assay takes advantage of the responsiveness of mitochondrial apoaequorin to intracellular calcium release induced by the activation of GPCRs (Stables et al., 1997, Anal. Biochem. 252:115-126; Detheux et al., 2000, J. Exp. Med., 192 1501-1508; both of which are incorporated herein by reference). Briefly, ChemerinR-expressing clones are transfected to coexpress mitochondrial apoaequorin and Gα16. Cells are incubated with 5 μM Coelenterazine H (Molecular Probes) for 4 hours at room temperature, washed in DMEM-F12 culture medium and resuspended at a concentration of 0.5×10\n6 \ncells/ml. Cells are then mixed with test agonist peptides and light emission by the aequorin is recorded with a luminometer for 30 sec. Results are expressed as Relative Light Units (RLU). Controls include assays using membranes isolated from cells not expressing ChemerinR (mock-transfected), in order to exclude possible non-specific effects of the candidate compound.\n\n\nAequorin activity or intracellular calcium levels are “changed” if light intensity increases or decreases by 10% or more in a sample of cells, expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide and treated with a candidate modulator, relative to a sample of cells expressing the ChemerinR polypeptide but not treated with the candidate modulator or relative to a sample of cells not expressing the ChemerinR polypeptide (mock-transfected cells) but treated with the candidate modulator.\n\n\nWhen performed in the absence of a Chemerin polypeptide, the assay can be used to identify an agonist of ChemerinR activity. When the assay is performed in the presence of a Chemerin polypeptide, it can be used to assay for an antagonist.\n\n \n \n \n \nb. Adenylate Cyclase Assay:\n \n \n \n\n\nAssays for adenylate cyclase activity are described by Kenimer & Nirenberg, 1981, Mol. Pharmacol. 20: 585-591, incorporated herein by reference. That assay is a modification of the assay taught by Solomon et al., 1974, Anal. Biochem. 58: 541-548, also incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, 100 μl reactions contain 50 mM Tris-Hcl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 20 mM creatine phosphate (disodium salt), 10 units (71 μg of protein) of creatine phosphokinase, 1 mM α-\n32\nP-ATP (tetrasodium salt, 2 μCi), 0.5 mM cyclic AMP, G-\n3\nH-labeled cyclic AMP (approximately 10,000 cpm), 0.5 mM Ro20-1724, 0.25% ethanol, and 50-200 μg of protein homogenate to be tested (i.e., homogenate from cells expressing or not expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide, treated or not treated with a Chemerin polypeptide with or without a candidate modulator). Reaction mixtures are generally incubated at 37° C. for 6 minutes. Following incubation, reaction mixtures are deproteinized by the addition of 0.9 ml of cold 6% trichloroacetic acid. Tubes are centrifuged at 1800×g for 20 minutes and each supernatant solution is added to a Dowex AG50W-X4 column. The cAMP fraction from the column is eluted with 4 ml of 0.1 mM imidazole-HCl (pH 7.5) into a counting vial. Assays should be performed in triplicate. Control reactions should also be performed using protein homogenate from cells that do not express a ChemerinR polypeptide.\n\n\nAccording to the invention, adenylate cyclase activity is “changed” if it increases or decreases by 10% or more in a sample taken from cells treated with a candidate modulator of ChemerinR activity, relative to a similar sample of cells not treated with the candidate modulator or relative to a sample of cells not expressing the ChemerinR polypeptide (mock-transfected cells) but treated with the candidate modulator.\n\n \n \n \n \nc. cAMP Assay:\n \n \n \n\n\nIntracellular or extracellular cAMP is measured using a cAMP radioimmunoassay (RIA) or cAMP binding protein according to methods widely known in the art. For example, Horton & Baxendale, 1995, Methods Mol. Biol. 41: 91-105, which is incorporated herein by reference, describes an RIA for cAMP.\n\n\nA number of kits for the measurement of cAMP are commercially available, such as the High Efficiency Fluorescence Polarization-based homogeneous assay marketed by LJL Biosystems and NEN Life Science Products. Control reactions should be performed using extracts of mock-transfected cells to exclude possible non-specific effects of some candidate modulators.\n\n\nThe level of cAMP is “changed” if the level of cAMP detected in cells, expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide and treated with a candidate modulator of ChemerinR activity (or in extracts of such cells), using the RIA-based assay of Horton & Baxendale, 1995, supra, increases or decreases by at least 10% relative to the cAMP level in similar cells not treated with the candidate modulator.\n\n \n \n \n \nd. Phospholipid Breakdown, DAG Production and Inositol Triphosphate Levels:\n \n \n \n\n\nReceptors that activate the breakdown of phospholipids can be monitored for changes due to the activity of known or suspected modulators of ChemerinR by monitoring phospholipid breakdown, and the resulting production of second messengers DAG and/or inositol triphosphate (IP\n3\n). Methods of measuring each of these are described in Phospholipid Signaling Protocols, edited by Ian M. Bird. Totowa, N.J., Humana Press, 1998, which is incorporated herein by reference. See also Rudolph et al., 1999, J. Biol. Chem. 274: 11824-11831, incorporated herein by reference, which also describes an assay for phosphatidylinositol breakdown. Assays should be performed using cells or extracts of cells expressing ChemerinR, treated or not treated with a Chemerin polypeptide with or without a candidate modulator. Control reactions should be performed using mock-transfected cells, or extracts from them in order to exclude possible non-specific effects of some candidate modulators.\n\n\nAccording to the invention, phosphatidylinositol breakdown, and diacylglycerol and/or inositol triphosphate levels are “changed” if they increase or decrease by at least 10% in a sample from cells expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide and treated with a candidate modulator, relative to the level observed in a sample from cells expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide that is not treated with the candidate modulator.\n\n \n \n \n \ne. PKC Activation Assays:\n \n \n \n\n\nGrowth factor receptor tyrosine kinases tend to signal via a pathway involving activation of Protein Kinase C (PKC), which is a family of phospholipid- and calcium-activated protein kinases. PKC activation ultimately results in the transcription of an array of proto-oncogene transcription factor-encoding genes, including c-fos, c-myc and c-jun, proteases, protease inhibitors, including collagenase type I and plasminogen activator inhibitor, and adhesion molecules, including intracellular adhesion molecule I (ICAM I). Assays designed to detect increases in gene products induced by PKC can be used to monitor PKC activation and thereby receptor activity. In addition, the activity of receptors that signal via PKC can be monitored through the use of reporter gene constructs driven by the control sequences of genes activated by PKC activation. This type of reporter gene-based assay is discussed in more detail below.\n\n\nFor a more direct measure of PKC activity, the method of Kikkawa et al., 1982, J. Biol. Chem. 257: 13341, incorporated herein by reference, can be used. This assay measures phosphorylation of a PKC substrate peptide, which is subsequently separated by binding to phosphocellulose paper. This PKC assay system can be used to measure activity of purified kinase, or the activity in crude cellular extracts. Protein kinase C sample can be diluted in 20 mM HEPES/2 mM DTT immediately prior to assay.\n\n\nThe substrate for the assay is the peptide Ac-FKKSFKL-NH2 (SEQ ID NO: 80), derived from the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate protein (MARCKS). The K\nm \nof the enzyme for this peptide is approximately 50 μM. Other basic, protein kinase C-selective peptides known in the art can also be used, at a concentration of at least 2-3 times their K\nm\n. Cofactors required for the assay include calcium, magnesium, ATP, phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol. Depending upon the intent of the user, the assay can be performed to determine the amount of PKC present (activating conditions) or the amount of active PCK present (non-activating conditions). For most purposes according to the invention, non-activating conditions will be used, such that the PKC that is active in the sample when it is isolated is measured, rather than measuring the PKC that can be activated. For non-activating conditions, calcium is omitted in the assay in favor of EGTA.\n\n\nThe assay is performed in a mixture containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1-2 mM DTT, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 100 μM ATP, ˜1 μCi γ-\n32\nP-ATP, 100 μg/ml peptide substrate (˜100 μM), 140 μM/3.8 μM phosphatidylserine/diacylglycerol membranes, and 100 μM calcium (or 500 μM EGTA). 48 μl of sample, diluted in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM DTT is used in a final reaction volume of 80 μl. Reactions are performed at 30° C. for 5-10 minutes, followed by addition of 25 μl of 100 mM ATP, 100 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, which stops the reactions.\n\n\nAfter the reaction is stopped, a portion (85 μl) of each reaction is spotted onto a Whatman P81 cellulose phosphate filter, followed by washes: four times 500 ml in 0.4% phosphoric acid, (5-10 mM per wash); and a final wash in 500 \nml\n 95% EtOH, for 2-5 mM. Bound radioactivity is measured by scintillation counting. Specific activity (cpm/nmol) of the labeled ATP is determined by spotting a sample of the reaction onto P81 paper and counting without washing. Units of PKC activity, defined as nmol phosphate transferred per min, are calculated as follows:\n\n\nThe activity, in UNITS (nmol/min) is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\ncpm\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\non\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\npaper\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n105\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nµl\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ntotal\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n85\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nµl\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nspotted\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\nassay\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ntime\n\n\n\n\n,\n\n\nmin\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nspecific\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nactivity\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nof\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nATP\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ncpm\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nn\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nmol\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn alternative assay can be performed using a Protein Kinase C Assay Kit sold by PanVera (Cat. # P2747).\n\n\nAssays are performed on extracts from cells expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide, treated or not treated with a Chemerin polypeptide with or without a candidate modulator. Control reactions should be performed using mock-transfected cells, or extracts from them in order to exclude possible non-specific effects of some candidate modulators.\n\n\nAccording to the invention, PKC activity is “changed” by a candidate modulator when the units of PKC measured by either assay described above increase or decrease by at least 10%, in extracts from cells expressing ChemerinR and treated with a candidate modulator, relative to a reaction performed on a similar sample from cells not treated with a candidate modulator.\n\n \n \n \n \nf. Kinase assays:\n \n \n \n\n\nMAP kinase activity can be assayed using any of several kits available commercially, for example, the p38 MAP Kinase assay kit sold by New England Biolabs (Cat # 9820) or the FlashPlate™ MAP Kinase assays sold by Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences.\n\n\nMAP Kinase activity is “changed” if the level of activity is increased or decreased by 10% or more in a sample from cells, expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide, treated with a candidate modulator relative to MAP kinase activity in a sample from similar cells not treated with the candidate modulator.\n\n\nDirect assays for tyrosine kinase activity using known synthetic or natural tyrosine kinase substrates and labeled phosphate are well known, as are similar assays for other types of kinases (e.g., Ser/Thr kinases). Kinase assays can be performed with both purified kinases and crude extracts prepared from cells expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide, treated with or without a Chemerin polypeptide, with or without a candidate modulator. Control reactions should be performed using mock-transfected cells, or extracts from them in order to exclude possible non-specific effects of some candidate modulators. Substrates can be either full length protein or synthetic peptides representing the substrate. Pinna & Ruzzene (1996, Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1314: 191-225, incorporated herein by reference) list a number of phosphorylation substrate sites useful for measuring kinase activities. A number of kinase substrate peptides are commercially available. One that is particularly useful is the “Src-related peptide,” RRLIEDAEYAARG (SEQ ID NO: 74; available from Sigma # A7433), which is a substrate for many receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. Because the assay described below requires binding of peptide substrates to filters, the peptide substrates should have a net positive charge to facilitate binding. Generally, peptide substrates should have at least 2 basic residues and a free amino terminus. Reactions generally use a peptide concentration of 0.7-1.5 mM.\n\n\nAssays are generally carried out in a 25 μl volume comprising 5 μl of 5× kinase buffer (5 mg/mL BSA, 150 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 100 mM MgCl\n2\n; depending upon the exact kinase assayed for, MnCl\n2 \ncan be used in place of or in addition to the MgCl\n2\n), 5 μl of 1.0 mM ATP (0.2 mM final concentration), γ-32P-ATP (100-500 cpm/pmol), 3 μl of 10 mM peptide substrate (1.2 mM final concentration), cell extract containing kinase to be tested (cell extracts used for kinase assays should contain a phosphatase inhibitor (e.g. 0.1-1 mM sodium orthovanadate)), and H\n2\nO to 25 μl. Reactions are performed at 30° C., and are initiated by the addition of the cell extract.\n\n\nKinase reactions are performed for 30 seconds to about 30 minutes, followed by the addition of 45 μl of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Samples are spun for 2 minutes in a microcentrifuge, and 35 μl of the supernatant is spotted onto Whatman P81 cellulose phosphate filter circles. The filters are washed three times with 500 ml cold 0.5% phosphoric acid, followed by one wash with 200 ml of acetone at room temperature for 5 minutes. Filters are dried and incorporated 32P is measured by scintillation counting. The specific activity of ATP in the kinase reaction (e.g., in cpm/pmol) is determined by spotting a small sample (2-5 μl) of the reaction onto a P81 filter circle and counting directly, without washing. Counts per minute obtained in the kinase reaction (minus blank) are then divided by the specific activity to determine the moles of phosphate transferred in the reaction.\n\n\nTyrosine kinase activity is “changed” if the level of kinase activity is increased or decreased by 10% or more in a sample from cells, expressing a ChemerinR polypeptide, treated with a candidate modulator relative to kinase activity in a sample from similar cells not treated with the candidate modulator.\n\n \n \n \n \ng. Transcriptional Reporters for Downstream Pathway Activation:\n \n \n \n\n\nThe intracellular signal initiated by binding of an agonist to a receptor, e.g., ChemerinR, sets in motion a cascade of intracellular events, the ultimate consequence of which is a rapid and detectable change in the transcription or translation of one or more genes. The activity of the receptor can therefore be monitored by measuring the expression of a reporter gene driven by control sequences responsive to ChemerinR activation.\n\n\nAs used herein “promoter” refers to the transcriptional control elements necessary for receptor-mediated regulation of gene expression, including not only the basal promoter, but also any enhancers or transcription-factor binding sites necessary for receptor-regulated expression. By selecting promoters that are responsive to the intracellular signals resulting from agonist binding, and operatively linking the selected promoters to reporter genes whose transcription, translation or ultimate activity is readily detectable and measurable, the transcription based reporter assay provides a rapid indication of whether a given receptor is activated.\n\n\nReporter genes such as luciferase, CAT, GFP, β-lactamase or β-galactosidase are well known in the art, as are assays for the detection of their products.\n\n\nGenes particularly well suited for monitoring receptor activity are the “immediate early” genes, which are rapidly induced, generally within minutes of contact between the receptor and the effector protein or ligand. The induction of immediate early gene transcription does not require the synthesis of new regulatory proteins. In addition to rapid responsiveness to ligand binding, characteristics of preferred genes useful to make reporter constructs include: low or undetectable expression in quiescent cells; induction that is transient and independent of new protein synthesis; subsequent shut-off of transcription requires new protein synthesis; and mRNAs transcribed from these genes have a short half-life. It is preferred, but not necessary that a transcriptional control element have all of these properties for it to be useful.\n\n\nAn example of a gene that is responsive to a number of different stimuli is the c-fos proto-oncogene. The c-fos gene is activated in a protein-synthesis-independent manner by growth factors, hormones, differentiation-specific agents, stress, and other known inducers of cell surface proteins. The induction of c-fos expression is extremely rapid, often occurring within minutes of receptor stimulation. This characteristic makes the c-fos regulatory regions particularly attractive for use as a reporter of receptor activation.\n\n\nThe c-fos regulatory elements include (see, Verma et al., 1987, Cell 51: 513-514): a TATA box that is required for transcription initiation; two upstream elements for basal transcription, and an enhancer, which includes an element with dyad symmetry and which is required for induction by TPA, serum, EGF, and PMA.\n\n\nThe 20 bp c-fos transcriptional enhancer element located between −317 and −298 bp upstream from the c-fos mRNA cap site, is essential for serum induction in serum starved NIH 3T3 cells. One of the two upstream elements is located at −63 to −57 and it resembles the consensus sequence for cAMP regulation.\n\n\nThe transcription factor CREB (cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein) is, as the name implies, responsive to levels of intracellular cAMP. Therefore, the activation of a receptor that signals via modulation of cAMP levels can be monitored by measuring either the binding of the transcription factor, or the expression of a reporter gene linked to a CREB-binding element (termed the CRE, or cAMP response element). The DNA sequence of the CRE is TGACGTCA (SEQ ID NO: 75). Reporter constructs responsive to CREB binding activity are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,919,649.\n\n\nOther promoters and transcriptional control elements, in addition to the c-fos elements and CREB-responsive constructs, include the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) gene promoter (cAMP responsive; Fink et al., 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85:6662-6666); the somatostatin gene promoter (cAMP responsive; Montminy et al., 1986, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 8.3:6682-6686); the proenkephalin promoter (responsive to cAMP, nicotinic agonists, and phorbol esters; Comb et al., 1986, Nature 323:353-356); the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy-kinase (PEPCK) gene promoter (cAMP responsive; Short et al., 1986, J. Biol. Chem. 261:9721-9726).\n\n\nAdditional examples of transcriptional control elements that are responsive to changes in GPCR activity include, but are not limited to those responsive to the AP-1 transcription factor and those responsive to NF-κB activity. The consensus AP-1 binding site is the palindrome TGA(C/G)TCA (Lee et al., 1987, Nature 325: 368-372; Lee et al., 1987, \nCell \n49: 741-752). The AP-1 site is also responsible for mediating induction by tumor promoters such as the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-β-acetate (TPA), and are therefore sometimes also referred to as a TRE, for TPA-response element. AP-1 activates numerous genes that are involved in the early response of cells to growth stimuli. Examples of AP-1-responsive genes include, but are not limited to the genes for Fos and Jun (which proteins themselves make up AP-1 activity), Fos-related antigens (Fra) 1 and 2, IκBα, ornithine decarboxylase, and annexins I and II.\n\n\nThe NF-κB binding element has the consensus sequence GGGGACTTTCC (SEQ ID NO: 81). A large number of genes have been identified as NF-κb responsive, and their control elements can be linked to a reporter gene to monitor GPCR activity. A small sample of the genes responsive to NF-κB includes those encoding IL-1β (Hiscott et al., 1993, Mol. Cell. Biol. 13: 6231-6240), TNF-α (Shakhov et al., 1990, J. Exp. Med. 171: 35-47), CCR5 (Liu et al., 1998, AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses 14: 1509-1519), P-selectin (Pan & McEver, 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 270: 23077-23083), Fas ligand (Matsui et al., 1998, J. Immunol. 161: 3469-3473), GM-CSF (Schreck & Baeuerle, 1990, Mol. Cell. Biol. 10: 1281-1286) and IκBα (Haskill et al., 1991, Cell 65: 1281-1289). Each of these references is incorporated herein by reference. Vectors encoding NF-κB-responsive reporters are also known in the art or can be readily made by one of skill in the art using, for example, synthetic NF-κB elements and a minimal promoter, or using the NF-κB-responsive sequences of a gene known to be subject to NF-κB regulation. Further, NF-κB responsive reporter constructs are commercially available from, for example, CLONTECH.\n\n\nA given promoter construct should be tested by exposing ChemerinR-expressing cells, transfected with the construct, to a Chemerin polypeptide. An increase of at least two-fold in the expression of reporter in response to Chemerin polypeptide indicates that the reporter is an indicator of ChemerinR activity.\n\n\nIn order to assay ChemerinR activity with a Chemerin-responsive transcriptional reporter construct, cells that stably express a ChemerinR polypeptide are stably transfected with the reporter construct. To screen for agonists, the cells are left untreated, exposed to candidate modulators, or exposed to a Chemerin polypeptide, and expression of the reporter is measured. The Chemerin-treated cultures serve as a standard for the level of transcription induced by a known agonist. An increase of at least 50% in reporter expression in the presence of a candidate modulator indicates that the candidate is a modulator of ChemerinR activity. An agonist will induce at least as much, and preferably the same amount or more, reporter expression than the Chemerin polypeptide. This approach can also be used to screen for inverse agonists where cells express a ChemerinR polypeptide at levels such that there is an elevated basal activity of the reporter in the absence of Chemerin or another agonist. A decrease in reporter activity of 10% or more in the presence of a candidate modulator, relative to its absence, indicates that the compound is an inverse agonist.\n\n\nTo screen for antagonists, the cells expressing ChemerinR and carrying the reporter construct are exposed to a Chemerin polypeptide (or another agonist) in the presence and absence of candidate modulator. A decrease of 10% or more in reporter expression in the presence of candidate modulator, relative to the absence of the candidate modulator, indicates that the candidate is a modulator of ChemerinR activity.\n\n\nControls for transcription assays include cells not expressing ChemerinR but carrying the reporter construct, as well as cells with a promoterless reporter construct. Compounds that are identified as modulators of ChemerinR-regulated transcription should also be analyzed to determine whether they affect transcription driven by other regulatory sequences and by other receptors, in order to determine the specificity and spectrum of their activity.\n\n\nThe transcriptional reporter assay, and most cell-based assays, are well suited for screening expression libraries for proteins for those that modulate ChemerinR activity. The libraries can be, for example, cDNA libraries from natural sources, e.g., plants, animals, bacteria, etc., or they can be libraries expressing randomly or systematically mutated variants of one or more polypeptides. Genomic libraries in viral vectors can also be used to express the mRNA content of one cell or tissue, in the different libraries used for screening of ChemerinR.\n\n\nAny of the assays of receptor activity, including the GTP-binding, GTPase, adenylate cyclase, cAMP, phospholipid-breakdown, diacylglyceorl, inositol triphosphate, PKC, kinase and transcriptional reporter assays, can be used to determine the presence of an agent in a sample, e.g., a tissue sample, that affects the activity of the ChemerinR receptor molecule. To do so, ChemerinR polypeptide is assayed for activity in the presence and absence of the sample or an extract of the sample. An increase in ChemerinR activity in the presence of the sample or extract relative to the absence of the sample indicates that the sample contains an agonist of the receptor activity. A decrease in receptor activity in the presence of Chemerin or another agonist and the sample, relative to receptor activity in the presence of Chemerin polypeptide alone, indicates that the sample contains an antagonist of ChemerinR activity. If desired, samples can then be fractionated and further tested to isolate or purify the agonist or antagonist. The amount of increase or decrease in measured activity necessary for a sample to be said to contain a modulator depends upon the type of assay used. Generally, a 10% or greater change (increase or decrease) relative to an assay performed in the absence of a sample indicates the presence of a modulator in the sample. One exception is the transcriptional reporter assay, in which at least a two-fold increase or 10% decrease in signal is necessary for a sample to be said to contain a modulator. It is preferred that an agonist stimulates at least 50%, and preferably 75% or 100% or more, e.g., 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold or greater receptor activation than wild-type Chemerin.\n\n\nOther functional assays include, for example, microphysiometer or biosensor assays (see Hafner, 2000, Biosens. Bioelectron. 15: 149-158, incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nII. Diagnostic Assays Based upon the Interaction of ChemerinR and Chemerin:\n\n\nSignaling through GPCRs is instrumental in the pathology of a large number of diseases and disorders. ChemerinR, which is expressed in cells of the lymphocyte lineages and which has been shown to act as a co-receptor for immunodeficiency viruses can have a role in immune processes, disorders or diseases. The ChemerinR expression pattern also includes bone and cartilage, indicating that this receptor can play a role in diseases, disorders or processes (e.g., fracture healing) affecting these tissues. Expression in adult parathyroid suggests possible importance in phosphocalic metabolism.\n\n\nBecause of its expression in cells of the lymphocyte lineages, ChemerinR can be involved in the body's response to viral infections or in diseases induced by various viruses, including HIV types I and II, or bacteria. The expression pattern of ChemerinR and the knowledge with respect to disorders generally mediated by GPCRs suggests that ChemerinR can be involved in disturbances of cell migration, cancer, development of tumors and tumor metastasis, inflammatory and neo-plastic processes, wound and bone healing and dysfunction of regulatory growth functions, diabetes, obesity, anorexia, bulimia, acute heart failure, hypotension, hypertension, urinary retention, osteoporosis, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, restenosis, atherosclerosis, diseases characterised by excessive smooth muscle cell proliferation, aneurysms, diseases characterised by loss of smooth muscle cells or reduced smooth muscle cell proliferation, stroke, ischemia, ulcers, allergies, benign prostatic hypertrophy, migraine, vomiting, psychotic and neurological disorders, including anxiety, schizophrenia, manic depression, depression, delirium, dementia and severe mental retardation, degenerative diseases, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease, and dyskinasias, such as Huntington's disease or Gilles de la Tourett's syndrome and other related diseases.\n\n\nThe interaction of ChemerinR with Chemerin can be used as the basis of assays for the diagnosis or monitoring of diseases, disorders or processes involving ChemerinR signaling. Diagnostic assays for ChemerinR-related diseases or disorders can have several different forms. First, diagnostic assays can measure the amount of ChemerinR and/or Chemerin polypeptide, genes or mRNA in a sample of tissue. Assays that measure the amount of mRNA encoding either or both of these polypeptides also fit in this category. Second, assays can evaluate the qualities of the receptor or the ligand. For example, assays that determine whether an individual expresses a mutant or variant form of either ChemerinR or Chemerin, or both, can be used diagnostically. Third, assays that measure one or more activities of ChemerinR polypeptide can be used diagnostically.\n\n\nA. Assays that Measure the Amount of ChemerinR or Chemerin\n\n\nChemerinR and Chemerin levels can be measured and compared to standards in order to determine whether an abnormal level of the receptor or its ligand is present in a sample, either of which indicate probable dysregulation of ChemerinR signaling. Polypeptide levels are measured, for example, by immunohistochemistry using antibodies specific for the polypeptide. A sample isolated from an individual suspected of suffering from a disease or disorder characterized by ChemerinR activity is contacted with an antibody for ChemerinR or Chemerin, and binding of the antibody is measured as known in the art (e.g., by measurement of the activity of an enzyme conjugated to a secondary antibody).\n\n\nAnother approach to the measurement of ChemerinR and/or Chemerin polypeptide levels uses flow cytometry analysis of cells from an affected tissue. Methods of flow cytometry, including the fluorescent labeling of antibodies specific for ChemerinR or Chemerin, are well known in the art. Other approaches include radioimmunoassay or ELISA. Methods for each of these are also well known in the art.\n\n\nThe amount of binding detected is compared to the binding in a sample of similar tissue from a healthy individual, or from a site on the affected individual that is not so affected. An increase of 10% or more relative to the standard is diagnostic for a disease or disorder characterized by ChemerinR dysregulation.\n\n\nChemerinR and Chemerin expression can also be measured by determining the amount of mRNA encoding either or both of the polypeptides in a sample of tissue. mRNA can be quantitated by quantitative or semi-quantitative PCR. Methods of “quantitative” amplification are well known to those of skill in the art, and primer sequences for the amplification of both ChemerinR and Chemerin are disclosed herein. A common method of quantitative PCR involves simultaneously co-amplifying a known quantity of a control sequence using the same primers. This provides an internal standard that can be used to calibrate the PCR reaction. Detailed protocols for quantitative PCR are provided in \nPCR Protocols, A Guide to Methods and Applications\n, Innis et al., Academic Press, Inc. N.Y., (1990), which is incorporated herein by reference. An increase of 10% or more in the amount of mRNA encoding ChemerinR or Chemerin in a sample, relative to the amount expressed in a sample of like tissue from a healthy individual or in a sample of tissue from an unaffected location in an affected individual is diagnostic for a disease or disorder characterized by dysregulation of ChemerinR signaling.\n\n\nB. Qualitative Assays\n\n\nAssays that evaluate whether or not the ChemerinR polypeptide or the mRNA encoding it are wild-type or not can be used diagnostically. In order to diagnose a disease or disorder characterized by ChemerinR or Chemerin dysregulation in this manner, RNA isolated from a sample is used as a template for PCR amplification of Chemerin and/or ChemerinR. The amplified sequences are then either directly sequenced using standard methods, or are first cloned into a vector, followed by sequencing. A difference in the sequence that changes one or more encoded amino acids relative to the sequence of wild-type ChemerinR or Chemerin can be diagnostic of a disease or disorder characterized by dysregulation of ChemerinR signaling. It can be useful, when a change in coding sequence is identified in a sample, to express the variant receptor or ligand and compare its activity to that of wild type ChemerinR or Chemerin. Among other benefits, this approach can provide novel mutants, including constitutively active and null mutants.\n\n\nIn addition to standard sequencing methods, amplified sequences can be assayed for the presence of specific mutations using, for example, hybridization of molecular beacons that discriminate between wild-type and variant sequences. Hybridization assays that discriminate on the basis of changes as small as one nucleotide are well known in the art. Alternatively, any of a number of “minisequencing” assays can be performed, including, those described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,888,819, 6,004,744 and 6,013,431 (incorporated herein by reference). These assays and others known in the art can determine the presence, in a given sample, of a nucleic acid with a known polymorphism.\n\n\nIf desired, array or microarray-based methods can be used to analyze the expression or the presence of mutation, in ChemerinR or Chemerin sequences. Array-based methods for minisequencing and for quantitation of nucleic acid expression are well known in the art.\n\n\nC. Functional Assays.\n\n\nDiagnosis of a disease or disorder characterized by the dysregulation of ChemerinR signaling can also be performed using functional assays. To do so, cell membranes or cell extracts prepared from a tissue sample are used in an assay of ChemerinR activity as described herein (e.g., ligand binding assays, the GTP-binding assay, GTPase assay, adenylate cyclase assay, cAMP assay, phospholipid breakdown, diacyl glycerol or inositol triphosphate assays, PKC activation assay, or kinase assay). The activity detected is compared to that in a standard sample taken from a healthy individual or from an unaffected site on the affected individual. As an alternative, a sample or extract of a sample can be applied to cells expressing ChemerinR, followed by measurement of ChemerinR signaling activity relative to a standard sample. A difference of 10% or more in the activity measured in any of these assays, relative to the activity of the standard, is diagnostic for a disease or disorder characterized by dysregulation of ChemerinR signaling.\n\n\nModulation of ChemerinR Activity in a Cell According to the Invention\n\n\nThe discovery of Chemerin as a ligand of ChemerinR provides methods of modulating the activity of a ChemerinR polypeptide in a cell. ChemerinR activity is modulated in a cell by delivering to that cell an agent that modulates the function of a ChemerinR polypeptide. This modulation can be performed in cultured cells as part of an assay for the identification of additional modulating agents, or, for example, in an animal, including a human. Agents include Chemerin polypeptides as defined herein, as well as additional modulators identified using the screening methods described herein.\n\n\nAn agent can be delivered to a cell by adding it to culture medium. The amount to deliver will vary with the identity of the agent and with the purpose for which it is delivered. For example, in a culture assay to identify antagonists of ChemerinR activity, one will preferably add an amount of Chemerin polypeptide that half-maximally activates the receptors (e.g., approximately EC\n50\n), preferably without exceeding the dose required for receptor saturation. This dose can be determined by titrating the amount of Chemerin polypeptide to determine the point at which further addition of Chemerin has no additional effect on ChemerinR activity.\n\n\nWhen a modulator of ChemerinR activity is administered to an animal for the treatment of a disease or disorder, the amount administered can be adjusted by one of skill in the art on the basis of the desired outcome. Successful treatment is achieved when one or more measurable aspects of the pathology (e.g., tumor cell growth, accumulation of inflammatory cells) is changed by at least 10% relative to the value for that aspect prior to treatment.\n\n\nCandidate Modulators Useful According to the Invention\n\n\nCandidate modulators can be screened from large libraries of synthetic or natural compounds. Numerous means are currently used for random and directed synthesis of saccharide, peptide, lipid, carbohydrate, and nucleic acid based compounds. Synthetic compound libraries are commercially available from a number of companies including, for example, Maybridge Chemical Co. (Trevillet, Cornwall, UK), Comgenex (Princeton, N.J.), Brandon Associates (Merrimack, N.H.), and Microsource (New Milford, Conn.). A rare chemical library is available from Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis.). Combinatorial libraries of small organic molecules are available and can be prepared. Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant and animal extracts are available from e.g., Pan Laboratories (Bothell, Wash.) or MycoSearch (NC), or are readily produceable by methods well known in the art. Additionally, natural and synthetically produced libraries and compounds are readily modified through conventional chemical, physical, and biochemical means.\n\n\nAs noted previously herein, candidate modulators can also be variants of known polypeptides (e.g., Chemerin, antibodies) or nucleic acids (e.g., aptamers) encoded in a nucleic acid library. Cells (e.g., bacteria, yeast or higher eukaryotic cells) transformed with the library can be grown and prepared as extracts, which are then applied in ChemerinR binding assays or functional assays of ChemerinR activity.\n\n\nIII. Antibodies Useful According to the Invention\n\n\nThe invention provides for antibodies to ChemerinR and Chemerin. Antibodies of the invention include, but are not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, multispecific, human, humanized or chimeric antibodies, single-chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab′) fragments, etc. The antibodies of the invention can be any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA, and IgY), class (e.g., IgG1-4, IgA1-2), or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody is an IgG isotype. In another preferred embodiment, the antibody is an IgG1 isotype. In another preferred embodiment, the antibody is an IgG2 isotype. In another preferred embodiment, the antibody is an IgG4 isotype.\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention may bind specifically to a polypeptide or polypeptide fragment or variant of Chemerin. Preferably, the antibodies of the invention bind specifically to the full-length Chemerin polypeptide. Also preferably, the antibodies of the invention bind specifically to the 157 amino acid truncated Preprochemerin polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 73). Also preferably, the antibodies of the invention bind specifically to the 19 amino acid Chemerin polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 53). Also preferably, the antibodies of the invention bind specifically to the 9 amino acid Chemerin polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 59). Also preferably, the antibodies of the invention bind specifically to the Chemerin fragment FSKALPRS (SEQ ID NO: 89).\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention may act as agonists or antagonists of the polypeptides of the invention. For example, the antibodies of the invention disrupt the Chemerin/ChemerinR interactions. The invention also features the antibodies that do not disrupt the Chemerin/ChemerinR interactions but disrupt the ChemerinR activation.\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention may be used, for example, but not limited to, to purify, detect, and target the polypeptides of the invention, including both in vitro and in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic methods. For example, the antibodies of the invention can be used in immunoassays for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring levels of the polypeptides of the present invention in biological samples (\nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual\n, Ed. by Harlow and Lane (Cold Spring Harbor Press: 1988)). The antibodies of the invention may be used either alone or in combination with other compositions. The antibodies may further be recombinantly fused to a heterologous polypeptide at the N- or C-terminus or chemically conjugated (including covalently and non-covalently conjugations) to polypeptides or other compositions. The antibodies of the invention may also be modified by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibodies, including by glycosylation, acetylation, pegylation, phosphylation, phosphorylation, amidation, derivatization by known protecting/blocking groups, proteolytic cleavage, linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein, etc.\n\n\nAntibodies can be made using standard protocols known in the art (See, for example, \nAntibodies: A Laboratory Manual\n, Ed. by Harlow and Lane (Cold Spring Harbor Press: 1988)). A mammal, such as a mouse, hamster, or rabbit can be immunized with an immunogenic form of the peptide (e.g., a ChemerinR or Chemerin polypeptide or an antigenic fragment which is capable of eliciting an antibody response, or a fusion protein as described herein above). Immunogens for raising antibodies are prepared by mixing the polypeptides (e.g., isolated recombinant polypeptides or synthetic peptides) with adjuvant. Alternatively, ChemerinR or Chemerin polypeptides or peptides are made as fusion proteins to larger immunogenic proteins. Polypeptides can also be covalently linked to other larger immunogenic proteins, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Alternatively, plasmid or viral vectors encoding ChemerinR or Chemerin, or a fragment of these proteins, can be used to express the polypeptides and generate an immune response in an animal as described in Costagliola et al., 2000, \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n105:803-811, which is incorporated herein by reference. In order to raise antibodies, immunogens are typically administered intradermally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly to experimental animals such as rabbits, sheep, and mice. In addition to the antibodies discussed above, genetically engineered antibody derivatives can be made, such as single chain antibodies.\n\n\nThe progress of immunization can be monitored by detection of antibody titers in plasma or serum. Standard ELISA, flow cytometry or other immunoassays can also be used with the immunogen as antigen to assess the levels of antibodies. Antibody preparations can be simply serum from an immunized animal, or if desired, polyclonal antibodies can be isolated from the serum by, for example, affinity chromatography using immobilized immunogen.\n\n\nTo produce monoclonal antibodies, antibody-producing splenocytes can be harvested from an immunized animal and fused by standard somatic cell fusion procedures with immortalizing cells such as myeloma cells to yield hybridoma cells. Such techniques are well known in the art, and include, for example, the hybridoma technique (originally developed by Kohler and Milstein, (1975) \nNature, \n256: 495-497), the human B cell hybridoma technique (Kozbar et al., (1983) \nImmunology Today, \n4:72), and the EBV-hybridoma technique to produce human monoclonal antibodies (Cole et al., (1985) \nMonoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy\n, Alan R. Liss, Inc. pp. 77-96). Hybridoma cells can be screened immunochemically for production of antibodies specifically reactive with a Chemerin or ChemerinR peptide or polypeptide, and monoclonal antibodies isolated from the media of a culture comprising such hybridoma cells.\n\n\nAntibody fragments of the invention may be generated by known techniques. For example, Fab and F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments of the invention may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules, using enzymes such as papain (to produce Fab fragments) or pepsin (to produce F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments).\n\n\nIV. Therapeutic Approaches Based on the Interaction of Chemerin and ChemerinR\n\n\nComposition or Therapeutic Composition and Administration Thereof\n\n\nThe invention provides composition or therapeutic compositions that contain a Chemerin polypeptide or a Chemerin nucleic acid sequence as described above. The therapeutic compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound including a Chemerin, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a preferred embodiment, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings.\n\n\nIn another preferred embodiment, the composition of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.\n\n\nGenerally, a composition will be administered in a single dosage in the range of 100 μg-100 mg/kg body weight, preferably in the range of 1 μg-100 μg/kg body weight. This dosage may be repeated daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or as considered appropriate by the treating physician. Alternatively, the therapeutically effective amount of the composition of the invention can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.\n\n\nThe invention also provides methods of treatment and inhibition for a disease or disorder by administration to a subject of an effective amount of a composition or therapeutic composition of the invention, preferably a nucleic acid or a polypeptide Chemerin molecule. In one aspect, the composition is substantially free from substances that limit effect or produce undesired side-effects of Chemerin. The subject can be any animal, and is preferably a mammal, and preferably a human.\n\n\nVarious delivery systems known in the art can be used to administer a composition of the invention, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the composition of the invention, receptor-mediated endocytosis, etc, which are incorporated by reference herein. Methods of introduction include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, and oral routes. The compositions of the invention may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition, it may be desirable to introduce the compositions or the therapeutic compositions of the invention into the central nervous system by any suitable route, including intraventricular and intrathecal injection; intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.\n\n\nThe invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention.\n\n\nVarious diseases or disorders can be treated with the compositions or therapeutic compositions of the invention. They include, but are not limited to, neoplasms located in the: colon, abdomen, bone, breast, digestive system, liver, pancreas, peritoneum, endocrine glands (adrenal, parathyroid, pituitary, testicles, ovary, thymus, thyroid), eye, head and neck, nervous (central and peripheral), lymphatic system, pelvic, skin, soft tissue, spleen, thoracic, and urogenital, as well as hypergammaglobulinemia, lymphoproliferative diseases, disorders, and/or conditions, paraproteinemias, purpura, sarcoidosis, Sezary Syndrome, Waldenstron's Macroglobulinemia, Gaucher's Disease, histiocytosis, and any other hyperproliferative disease.\n\n\nTransgenic Animals Useful According to the Invention\n\n\nTransgenic animals expressing ChemerinR or Chemerin or variants thereof are useful to study the signaling through ChemerinR, as well as for the study of drugs or agents that modulate the activity of ChemerinR. A transgenic animal is a non-human animal containing at least one foreign gene, called a transgene, which is part of its genetic material. Preferably, the transgene is contained in the animal's germ line such that it can be transmitted to the animal's offspring. A number of techniques may be used to introduce the transgene into an animal's genetic material, including, but not limited to, microinjection of the transgene into pronuclei of fertilized eggs and manipulation of embryonic stem cells (U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,191 by Wagner and Hoppe; Palmiter and Brinster, 1986, Ann. Rev. Genet., 20:465-499; French Patent Application 2593827 published Aug. 7, 1987, all of which are incorporated herein by reference). Transgenic animals can carry the transgene in all their cells or can be genetically mosaic.\n\n\nAccording to the method of conventional transgenesis, additional copies of normal or modified genes are injected into the male pronucleus of the zygote and become integrated into the genomic DNA of the recipient mouse. The transgene is transmitted in a Mendelian manner in established transgenic strains. Transgenes can be constitutively expressed or can be tissue specific or even responsive to an exogenous drug, e.g., Tetracycline. A transgenic animal expressing one transgene can be crossed to a second transgenic animal expressing a second transgene such that their offspring will carry and express both transgenes.\n\n\nKnock-Out Animals\n\n\nAnimals bearing a homozygous deletion in the chromosomal sequences encoding either ChemerinR or Chemerin or variants can be used to study the function of the receptor and ligand. Of particular interest is whether a Chemerin knockout has a distinct phenotype, which may point to whether Chemerin is the only ligand that binds ChemerinR or if it is a member of a family. Of further particular interest is the identification of identification of ChemerinR/Chemerin in specific physiological and/or pathological processes.\n\n\ni. Standard Knock Out Animals\n\n\nKnock out animals are produced by the method of creating gene deletions with homologous recombination. This technique is based on the development of embryonic stem (ES) cells that are derived from embryos, are maintained in culture and have the capacity to participate in the development of every tissue in the animals when introduced into a host blastocyst. A knock out animal is produced by directing homologous recombination to a specific target gene in the ES cells, thereby producing a null allele of the gene. The technology for making knock-out animals is well described (see, for example, Huszar et al., 1997, Cell, 88:131; and Ohki-Hamazaki et al., 1997, Nature, 390:165, both of which are incorporated herein by reference). One of skill in the art can generate a homozygous ChemerinR or Chemerin knock-out animal (e.g., a mouse) using the sequences for ChemerinR and Chemerin (disclosed herein and known in the art) to make the gene targeting construct.\n\n\nii. Tissue Specific Knock Out\n\n\nThe method of targeted homologous recombination has been improved by the development of a system for site-specific recombination based on the bacteriophage P1 site specific recombinase Cre. The Cre-loxP site-specific DNA recombinase from bacteriophage P1 is used in transgenic mouse assays in order to create gene knockouts restricted to defined tissues or developmental stages. Regionally restricted genetic deletion, as opposed to global gene knockout, has the advantage that a phenotype can be attributed to a particular cell/tissue (Marth, 1996, \nClin. Invest. \n97: 1999). In the Cre-loxP system one transgenic mouse strain is engineered such that loxP sites flank one or more exons of the gene of interest. Homozygotes for this so called ‘foxed gene’ are crossed with a second transgenic mouse that expresses the Cre gene under control of a cell/tissue type transcriptional promoter. Cre protein then excises DNA between loxP recognition sequences and effectively removes target gene function (Sauer, 1998, \nMethods, \n14:381). There are now many in vivo examples of this method, including, for instance, the inducible inactivation of mammary tissue specific genes (Wagner et al., 1997, \nNucleic Acids Res., \n25:4323). One of skill in the art can therefore generate a tissue-specific knock-out animal in which ChemerinR or Chemerin is homozygously eliminated in a chosen tissue or cell type.\n\n\nKits Useful According to the Invention\n\n\nThe invention provides for kits useful for screening for modulators of ChemerinR activity, as well as kits useful for diagnosis of diseases or disorders characterized by dysregulation of ChemerinR signaling. Kits useful according to the invention can include an isolated ChemerinR polypeptide (including a membrane- or cell-associated ChemerinR polypeptide, e.g., on isolated membranes, cells expressing ChemerinR, or, on an SPR chip) and an isolated Chemerin polypeptide. A kit can also comprise an antibody specific for ChemerinR and/or an antibody for Chemerin. Alternatively, or in addition, a kit can contain cells transformed to express a ChemerinR polypeptide and/or cells transformed to express a Chemerin polypeptide. In a further embodiment, a kit according to the invention can contain a polynucleotide encoding a ChemerinR polypeptide and/or a polynucleotide encoding a Chemerin polypeptide. In a still further embodiment, a kit according to the invention may comprise the specific primers useful for amplification of ChemerinR or Chemerin as described below. All kits according to the invention will comprise the stated items or combinations of items and packaging materials therefor. Kits will also include instructions for use.\n\n\nExpression Vectors\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to vectors containing the Chemerin and host cells, as well as the production of the Chemerin polypeptide by recombinant techniques. The vector may be a phage, plasmid, viral, or retroviral vector. The Chemerin polynucleotides may be joined to a vector containing a selectable marker propagation in a host. The Chemerin polynucleotide should be operatively linked to an appropriate promoter, as the phage lambda PL promoter, the \nE. coli \nlac, trp, phoA and tac promoters, the SV40 early and late promoters and promoters of retroviral LTRs. The expression vectors will further contain sites for transcription initiation, termination, and, in the transcribed region, a ribosome binding site for translation. The coding portion of the transcripts expressed by the constructs will preferably include a translation initiating codon at the beginning and a termination codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) appropriately positioned at the end of the polypeptide to be translated. The expressing vectors will also include one or more promoters. Suitable promoters which may be employed include, but are not limited to, retroviral LTR, the SV40 promoter, adenoviral promoters; heterologous promoters, such as the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter; the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) promoter; inducible promoters, such as the MMT promoter, the metallothionein promoter; heat shock promoters; the albumin promoter; the ApoAI promoter; human globin promoters; viral thymidine kinase promoters, such as the Herpes Simplex thymidine kinase promoter; retroviral LTRs (including the modified retroviral LTRs hereinabove described).; the .beta.-actin promoter; and human growth hormone promoters. The promoter also may be the native promoter which controls the genes encoding the polypeptides.\n\n\nAs indicated, the expression vectors will preferably include at least one selectable marker. Such markers include dihydrofolate reductase, G418, glutamine synthase or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture and tetracycline, kanamycin or ampicillin resistance genes for culturing in \nE. coli \nand other bacteria. Representative examples of appropriate hosts include, but are not limited to, bacterial cells, such as \nE. coli, Streptomyces \nand \nSalmonella typhimurium \ncells; fungal cells, such as yeast cells (e.g., \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae \nor \nPichia pastoris \n(ATCC Accession No. 201178)); insect cells such as \nDrosophila \nS2 and \nSpodoptera \nSf9 cells; animal cells such as CHO, NSO, COS, 293, and Bowes melanoma cells; and plant cells. Appropriate culture mediums and conditions for the above-described host cells are known in the art.\n\n\nGene Transfer Methods\n\n\nGene therapy has been studied and used for treating various types of diseases. Generally, gene therapy comprises delivering a gene of interest to cells affected with diseases for correction of abnormal conditions. The invention provides for gene transfer methods of the Chemerin gene for treatment of diseases including tumors/cancers such as cancers in lung, prostate, oesophagus, Pharynx, Colon-rectum, liver-bilary tract, stomach, larynx, pancreas, bladder, breast, colon-rectum, ovary, stomach, womb-leasing, pancreas, lung, liver, lymphoma, leukemia. Gene transfer of the Chemerin gene in accordance with the present invention can be accomplished through many means, including by both viral vectors and by non-viral methods.\n\n\nThe non-viral gene transfer methods include plasmid DNA expression vectors, liposomes, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and particle-mediated (gene gun) methods etc. All these methods are well known in the art and are incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\nThe viral gene transfer methods include retrovirus (including lentivirus), adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, herpes simplex virus, vaccinia, fowlpox, canarypox virus, Sindbis virus etc, which are well known in the art. In one embodiment, the gene transfer relates to recombinant retrovirus vectors such as the virus based on Mouse Moloney Leukemia virus, the chimeric Moloney-Human lentiviral (HIV) vector etc.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the gene transfer relates to human adenoviruses. The human adenovirus is a 36 kb double-stranded DNA virus containing genes that express more than 50 gene products throughout its life cycle. By eliminating the E1 region of the vector, the virus lacks ability to self-replicate and space is made for placing therapeutic expression sequences. The adenovirus vectors have been shown to be especially efficient at transferring genes into most tissues after in vivo administration. In another particular embodiment, the adenovirus vector can be modified to exhibit tissue-specific, tumor-selective expression (Doronin, K et al. (2001) \nJ. Virology, \n75:3314-3324). In one example, the adenovirus promoter E1A region is deleted and replaced with a modified promoter for α-fectoprotein (AFP). The expression of this modified adenovirus vector is limited to hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hallenbeck, P L et al. (1999) \nHuman Gene Ther. \n10:1721-1733). In another example, the adenovirus E4 promoter region is deleted and replaced with the promoter for surfactant protein B (SPB). The expression of the modified adenovirus is limited to lung carcinoma cells (Doronin, K et al. (2001) \nJ. Virology, \n75:3314-3324).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the gene transfer relates to recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. The AAV vectors contain small, single-stranded DNA genomes and have been shown to transduce brain, skeletal muscle, and liver tissues.\n\n\nThe cells targeted for gene transfer include any cells to which the delivery of the Chemerin gene is desired. Generally, the cells are those affected with diseases such as but not limited to tumoric cells. Various mammalian cell lines can also be employed for gene transfer, examples includes, but not limited to, COS-7 lines of monkey kidney fibroblasts, described by Gluzman, \nCell \n23:175 (1981), and other cell lines capable of expressing a compatible vector, for example, the C127, 3T3, CHO, HeLa and BHK cell lines. In particular, the cells are cell lines derived from tissues affected by dieseases, such as cancer cell lines.\n\n\nEx Vivo Therapeutic Approaches Based on the Interaction of Chemerin and ChemerinR\n\n\nThe ex vivo gene therapy involves removing cells from the blood or tissues of a subject, genetically modifying in vitro, and subsequently transplanting back into the same recipient. In one embodiment, a nucleic acid sequence is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting reombination cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art, including but not limited to transfection, electroporation, microinjection, infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequence, cell fusion, chromosome-mediated gene transfer, microcell-mediated gene transfer, shperoplast fusion, etc, all are known in the art. The gene transfer methods should provide for stable transfer of the nucleic acid sequence to the cell, so that the nucleic acid sequence is expressible in the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny. The resulting recombinant blood cells are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect, patient state, etc., and can be determined by one skilled in the art. Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired, available cell type, and include but are not limited to epithelial cells, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, muscle cells, hepatocytes; blood cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, megakaryocytes, granulocytes; various stem or progenitor cells, in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells, e.g., as obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood, fetal liver, etc. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence encodes a Chemerin polypeptide including the polypeptides ranging from the truncated to the full-length and the variants of the Chemerin polypeptide that bind specifically to a ChemerinR polypeptide. In a preferred embodiment, the cell used for ex vivo gene therapy is autologous to the recipient.\n\n\nIn another preferred embodiment, cells used are dendritic cells. For example, dendritic cells can be derived from hematopoietic progenitors or from adherent peripheral blood monocytes. The cultured dendritic cells are then loaded with tumor-associated antigens. Tumor antigen loading can be accomplished by a variety of techniques including (1) pulsing with purified defined peptides or modified tumor lysate, (2) co-culture with apoptotic tumor cells, (3) transfection with RNA, (4) fusion with tumor cells, or (5) gene transfer with viral or non-viral gene transfer systems as described above. The loaded dendritic cells are injected into a subject for stimulating immune response of the subject.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, cells can be pulsed with different types of compositions, preferably proteins or peptides. Such technique is known to one skilled in the art and is described in Nestle et al. (1998) Nat. Med. 4:328-332. Briefly, cells are transferred into a suitable medium and incubated in vitro for an appropriate time with the composition. The cells are then washed and resuspended in a suitable volume of medium for in vivo transfer. In a preferred embodiment, the cells used for peptide pulsing are of the same species as the individual to whom the composition should be applied. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the cells are autologous to the recipient. In another particularly preferred embodiment, the cells are dendritic cells.\n\n\nParticular examples of ex vivo dendritic cell gene therapy include those that have been assessed in melanoma (Nestle et al. (1998) \nNat. Med. \n4:328-332), renal cancer (Kurokawa et al. (2001), \nInt. J. Cancer, \n91:749-756), glioma (Yu et al (2001), Cancer Res., 61:842-847), breast and ovarian (Brossart et al. (2000), \nBlood, \n96:3102-3108), prostate (Burch et al. (2000), \nClin. Cancer Res., \n6:2175-2182), gastrointestinal, colon and lung (Fong et al. (2001) \nJ. Immunl., \n166:4254-4259).\n\n\nIn Vivo Gene Therapy\n\n\nThe present invention provides in vivo gene therapy methods. Such methods involve the direct administration of nucleic acid or a nucleic acid/protein complex into the individual being treated. For example, successful examples of animal models with in vivo gene therapy can be found in treatment of lung cancer (Zhang and Roth (1994), \nIn Vivo, \n8(5):755-769) and cutaneous melanoma (Gary et al. (1993), \nPNAS USA, \n90:11307-11311), etc.\n\n\nThe nucleic acid or protein is preferably Preprochemerin or ChemerinR (SEQ ID NO: 7), truncated Preprochemerin (SEQ ID NO: 72) or ChemerinR (SEQ ID NO: 1) of the invention. In vivo administration can be accomplished according to a number of established techniques including, but not limited to, injection of naked nucleic acid, viral infection, transport via liposomes and transport by endocytosis as described above. Suitable viral vectors include, for example, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus and retrovirus vectors etc as described in detail above.\n\n\nThe Preprochemerin or truncated Preprochemerin polynucleotides in a vector can be delivered to the interstitial space of tissues with a subject, including of muscle, skin, brain, lung, liver, spleen, bone marrow, thymus, heart, lymph, blood, bone, cartilage, pancreas, kidney, gall bladder, stomach, intestine, testis, ovary, uterus, rectum, nervous system, eye, gland, and connective tissue.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the Preprochemerin polynucleotides or truncated Preprochemerin/Chemerin or truncated Preprochemerin polypeptides are complexed in a liposome preparation. Liposomal preparations for use in the present invention include cationic, anionic, and neutral preparations, all are well known in the art.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a retroviral vector containing a Preprochemerin or truncated Preprochemerin RNA sequence is used for in vivo gene therapy. In another embodiment of the invention, an adenovirus-associated virus vector containing a preprochemerin or truncated Preprochemerin polynucleotides is used. In another embodiment, an adenovirus vector containing a Preprochemerin polypeptide is used.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the viral vectors for gene transfer are adenovirus vectors whose promoters are modified so that the expression of the vectors is limited to a specific tumor or a particular tissue. This type of vectors have the advantages of delivering the gene of interest to the targeted location, thus reducing the chance of harm due to the unspecific delivery of the viral vector to a variety of tissues including the normal cell tissues.\n\n\nIn a particular embodiment of the invention, the in vivo gene therapy includes administering the gene that encodes a Preprochemerin or truncated Preprochemerin polypeptide into a subject for stimulating immune response of the subject or therapeutic treatment of a disease. Preferably, the gene encoding a Preprochemerin or truncated Preprochemerin polypeptide is administered by a plasmid vector, or a viral vector, or non-viral methods. Preferably, the gene encoding a Preprochemerin or truncated Preprochemerin polypeptide is administered by a adenovirus vector whose expression is tissue-specific and/or tumor-selective.\n\n\nThe polynucleotides encoding Preprochemerin or truncated Preprochemerin may be administered along with other polynucleotides encoding an angiogenic protein. Examples of angiogenic proteins include, but are not limited to, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors, VEGF-1, VEGF-2, VEGF-3, epidermal growth factor alpha and beta, platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, tumor necrosis factor alpha, hepatocyte growth factor, insulin like growth factor, colony stimulating factor, macrophage colony stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor, and nitric oxide synthase.\n\n\nDetermining an effective amount of substance to be delivered can depend upon a number of factors including, for example, the chemical structure and biological activity of the substance, the age and weight of the animal, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, and the route of administration. The frequency of treatments depends upon a number of factors, such as the amount of polynucleotide constructs administered per dose, as well as the health and history of the subject. The precise amount, number of doses, and timing of doses will be determined by the attending physician or veterinarian.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nIn the following examples, all chemicals are obtained from Sigma, unless stated. The cell culture media are from Gibco BRL and the peptides are from Bachem.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nCloning of Human ChemerinR Receptor\n\n\nHuman ChemerinR was cloned as described in Samson et al. (1998) (SEQ ID NOS: 1 and 2). As an example of one set of steps one could use to clone other ChemerinR polypeptides useful according to the invention, the method is described here. In order to clone the ChemerinR sequence, a classical cloning procedure was performed on human genomic DNA. A clone, designated HOP 102 (ChemerinR), was amplified from human genomic DNA by using degenerate oligonucleotides. \nHOP\n 102 shared 45-50% identity with fMLP and C5a receptors and somewhat lower similarities with the family of chemokine receptors (\nFIG. 5\n). This partial clone was used as a probe to screen a human genomic library and three overlapping lambda clones were isolated. A restriction map of the clones was established and a 1.7 kb XbaI fragment was subcloned in pBS SK+ (Stratagene) and sequenced on both strands. The sequence was found to include the \nHOP\n 102 probe entirely, with 100% identity. This novel gene was named ChemerinR (GenBank Accession No. Y14838).\n\n\nAmplification of coding sequence of ChemerinR resulted in a fragment of 1.1 kb. This fragment was subcloned into the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) vector and sequenced on both strands (\nFIGS. 1 and 2\n).\n\n\nThe mouse and rat ortholog genes are disclosed in \nFIGS. 3 and 4\n respectively.\n\n\nExample 2a\n\n\nPurification of the Natural Ligand of ChemerinR and Identification of Chemerin\n\n\nApproximately one liter of a human ascitic fluid from a patient with ovarian cancer was prefiltered and then filtered successively through 0.45 and 0.22 μm Millex filters (Millipore).\n\n\nIn \nstep\n 1, the ascite was directly loaded onto a C18 reverse-phase column (10 mm×100 mm POROS 20 R2 beads, Applied Biosystems) pre-equilibrated with 5% CH\n3\nCN/0.1% TFA at a flow-rate of 20 ml/min at room temperature. A 5-95% gradient of CH\n3\nCN in 0.1% TFA was then applied with a slope of 6%/min. 5-milliliter fractions were collected, and 20 μl of each fraction was set aside and assayed for [Ca\n2+\n] transients in ChemerinR-expressing CHO cells.\n\n\nIn \nstep\n 2, the active fractions (approx. 10 fractions eluting between 25 and 40% CH\n3\nCN) were pooled, adjusted at \npH\n 5, filtered through a 20 μm Millex filter (Millipore), diluted 3-fold in acetate buffer at pH 4.8 and then applied to a cation-exchange HPLC column (Polycat 9.6 mm×250 mm, Vydac) pre-equilibrated with acetate buffer at pH 4.8 and 4° C. A 0-1M gradient of NaCl in acetate buffer at pH 4.8 was applied with 10%/min at a flow-rate of 4 ml/min. 1-milliliter fractions were collected and a 25 μl-aliquot from each fraction was used for the [Ca\n2+\n] assay after desalting on a 10 kDa-cut-off membrane (Ultrafree, Millipore).\n\n\nIn \nstep\n 3, the active fractions (eluted with approx. 700 mM NaCl) were pooled and desalted onto a 10 kDa-cut-off Ultrafree membrane to approx. 10 mM NaCl concentration. The eluates from distinct cation-exchange HPLC runs were pooled and loaded onto a second cation-exchange HPLC column (Polycat 2.1 mm×250 mm, Vydac) pre-equilibrated with acetate buffer at pH 4.8 and 4° C. A 0-1 M gradient of NaCl in acetate buffer at pH 4.8 was applied at a flow-rate of 1 ml/min. with a slope of 2%/min 0.5-milliliter fractions were collected and a 20 μl-aliquot from each fraction was used for intracellular calcium assay after desalting onto a 10 kDa-cut-off Ultrafree membrane.\n\n\nIn \nstep\n 4, the active fractions were pooled, diluted 8-fold with H\n2\nO/0.1% H\n3\nPO\n4 \nand loaded onto an analytical C18 reverse-phase column (4.6 mm×250 mm, Vydac) pre-equilibrated with 5% CH\n3\nCN/0.1% H\n3\nPO\n4 \nat a flow-rate of 1 ml/min at room temperature. A 5-95% gradient of CH\n3\nCN in 0.1% H\n3\nPO\n4 \nwas applied with a 0.3%/min. gradient between 25 and 40% of CH\n3\nCN. Individual UV absorption peaks (214 nm) were collected manually, and approx. 5% from each fraction volume was assayed for biological activity.\n\n\nIn \nstep\n 5, the active peaks (approximatively 28% CH\n3\nCN) were diluted 6-fold with H\n2\nO/0.1% TFA and directly loaded onto a second C18 reverse-phase column (1 mm×50 mm, Vydac) pre-equilibrated with 5% CH\n3\nCN/0.1% TFA at a flow-rate of 0.1 ml/min. at room temperature. A 5-95% gradient of CH\n3\nCN in 0.1% TFA was applied with a 0.3%/min. gradient between 30 and 45% of CH\n3\nCN. The final peak was collected manually at 40% CH\n3\nCN and analysed by mass spectrometry. 800 ml of ovarian cancer ascites fluid yielded 50 fmoles of Chemerin.\n\n\nThe active fraction was completely dried in a speed-vac and resuspended in 10 μl of 0.1M Tris at pH 8.7. After boiling the sample during 15 min at 95° C., the sample was incubated at 37° C. overnight in the presence of 250 ng of modified trypsin (Promega). The digested sample was then purified by solid-phase extraction onto a C18 ZipTip (Millipore). The eluted sample (1.5 μl in 70% CH\n3\nCN/0.1% TFA) was applied onto a MALDI target in the presence of 120 mg/ml dihydroxy-benzoic acid matrix and then analysed on a MALDI-Q-TOF prototype (Micromass). Eight peptides were predicted to derive from the product of the human tazarotene-induced gene (Tig)-2 (\nFIG. 20\n), covering 91 aminoacids out of the 143 aminoacid-long sequence of the Tig-2 gene product (after removal of the predicted signal peptide). However, the C-terminal peptide (peptide 8) was not tryptic, lacking the last six amino acids of the predicted protein. This observation indicated that the active compound might result from the proteolytic processing of the encoded precursor (\nFIGS. 12 and 13\n).\n\n\nExample 2b\n\n\nPurification of Human Native Chemerin (FIG. \n21\n)\n\n\nOne liter of ascitic fluid was filtered and loaded (50 ml per run) onto a reverse-phase column (10×100 mm, \nPoros\n 20 R2 beads, Applied Biosystems). A 5-95% CH\n3\nCN gradient (6%/min) in 0.1% TFA was applied, 5 ml fractions were collected and assayed for ChemR23 activation. Active fractions were adjusted to pH 4.8 and applied to a cation-exchange HPLC column (Polycat 9.6×250 mm, Vydac) in the presence of 10% CH\n3\nCN, eluted with a 0-1 M NaCl gradient (10%/min) in \nacetate buffer pH\n 5. Active fractions were desalted (Ultrafree, cut-off: 10 kDa, Millipore), loaded onto a second cation-exchange column (Polycat 2.1×250 mm, Vydac) and eluted with the same buffer (2%/min NaCl gradient). Active fractions (0.5 ml, desalted) were pooled, diluted 8-fold with 0.1% H3PO\n4 \nand loaded onto a C18 column (4.6×250 mm, Vydac). A 5-95% CH\n3\nCN gradient (0.3%/min) in 0.1% H\n3\nPO\n4 \nwas applied and individual UV absorption peaks (214 nm) were collected manually and assayed. The active fractions were loaded onto a second C18 column (2.1×250 mm, Vydac, 5-95% CH\n3\nCN in 0.1% TFA, 0.3%/min). The peaks were collected manually and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The use of human material collected for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes was approved by the ethical committee of the Medical School of the Université Libre de Bruxelles.\n\n\nExample 2c\n\n\nMass Spectrometry Analysis\n\n\nThe active fractions were vacuum dried, resuspended in 10 μl of 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.7, heated for 15 min at 95° C., incubated overnight at 37° C. with 250 ng of trypsin (Promega) and purified by solid-phase extraction (C18 ZipTip, Millipore). The digested peptides were eluted in 1.5 μl of 70% CH\n3\nCN/0.1% TFA onto a metallic MALDI target, dried and then mixed in 1.5 μl of matrix mix (2 mg/\nml\n 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 10 mg/ml (-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 2 mM fucose, 5 mM ammonium acetate). For proteic samples excised from SDS/acrylamide gels, the samples were processed as described (14). For determination of the N-terminus of the recombinant protein, the digested peptides were first separated onto a C18 column (1×250 mm, Vydac, 5-95% CH\n3\nCN in 0.1% TFA, 2%/min) and each HPLC fraction was analyzed separately. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a Q-TOF Ultima Global mass spectrometer equipped with a MALDI source (Micromass), and calibrated using the monoisotopic masses of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides from bovine serum albumin. Ionization was achieved using a nitrogen laser (337 nm beam, 10 Hz) and acquisitions were performed in a V mode reflectron position. Microsequencing was performed by argon-induced fragmentation after selection of the parent ion.\n\n\nEight peptides were predicted to derive from the product of the human tazarotene-induced gene (TIG)-2 (\nFIG. 22\n), covering 91 aminoacids out of the 143 aminoacid-long sequence of the TIG-2 gene product (after removal of the predicted signal peptide). However, the C-terminal peptide (peptide 8) was not tryptic lacking the last six amino acids of the predicted protein. This observation indicated that the active compound might result from the proteolytic processing of the encoded precursor (Table 1 and \nFIG. 22\n).\n\n\nTable 1: Sequences of Peptides Found in Monoisotopic Mass Fingerprinting\n\n\nThe two peptides indicated with an asterisk were microsequenced by MS/MS fragmentation.

The supernatant containing Chemerin-SEAP-His6 is collected after centrifugation, filtered (0.45 μm) and stored at 4° C. after adding 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.02% sodium azide.\n\n\nFor one-step affinity purification of the Chemerin fusion protein, the supernatant is applied to 1 ml of Hisbond resin (Qiagen). After washing, bound Chemerin-SEAP-His6 is eluted with a gradient of imidazol. The concentration of isolated Chemerin-SEAP-His6 is determined by a sandwich type enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Briefly microtiter plates are coated with anti-placental alkaline phosphatase antibody. After blocking with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate buffered saline, the samples are titrated and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, plates are incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-placental alkaline phosphatase diluted 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature, washed again, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 30 min. After washing, bound peroxidase is reacted with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. The reaction is stopped by adding 1 NH\n2\nSO\n4\n, and absorbance at 450 nm is measured. Alkaline phosphatase activity is determined by a chemiluminescent assay using the Great Escape™ detection kit (Clontech). Purified placental alkaline phophatase is used to generate a standard curve. The enzymatic activity is expressed as relative light units/sec.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR\n\n\nChemerinR and Chemerin transcripts were detected by quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan) in total or polyA+ RNA samples from human tissues and blood cell populations obtained commercially (Clontech and Ambion) or prepared locally (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen). Primers were 5′-GCAGACAAGCTGCCGGA-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 34) as forward, 5′-AGTTTGATGCAGGCCAGGC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 35) as reverse and 5′-AACCCGAGTGCAAAGTCAGGCCC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 36) as probe for Chemerin, 5′-GTCCCAGAACCACCGCAG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 37) as forward, 5′-AAGAAAGCCAGGACCCAGATG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 38) as reverse and 5′-TTCGCCTGGCTTACAT GGCCTGC-3′(SEQ ID NO: 39) as probe for ChemerinR and 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 40) as forward, 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 41) as reverse and 5′-AGCTCTCCCGCCGGCCTCTG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 42) as probe for the reference housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Standard curves were run systematically for the three genes, and the transcript copy number of proChemerin and ChemerinR was normalized to the GAPDH transcript copy number for each sample.\n\n\nWe investigated the presence of prochemerin and chemerinR transcripts in various human tissues and leukocyte populations by real-time RT-PCR (Taqman). In addition to immature dendritic cells, chemerinR transcripts were found primarily in spleen, lymph nodes and lung, and at lower levels in a number of other tissues (\nFIG. 24B\n). Abundant chemerin transcripts were found in liver, lung, pituitary and ovary (\nFIG. 24C\n), and lower levels could be detected in most tissues. Interestingly however, no expression of chemerin was found in peripheral blood leukocyte populations. Monoclonal antibodies generated against human chemerinR by genetic immunization (as described in Costagliola et al., 1998), and characterized by FACS on CHO-K1 cell lines expressing the receptor (data not shown) were used to confirm the presence of the receptor at the surface of dendritic cells and macrophages. High levels of chemerinR immunoreactivity were found on monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells, and chemerinR was downmodulated following maturation of the cells as a result of LPS or CD40L stimulation (\nFIGS. 24\n, D and E). Similarly, chemerinR immunoreactivity was observed at the surface of monocyte-derived human macrophages (\nFIG. 24F\n).\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nFunctional Assay for ChemerinR\n\n\nChemerinR-expres sing clones have been obtained by transfection of CHO-K1 cells to coexpressing mitochondrial apoaequorin and Gα16, limiting dilution and selection by northern blotting. Positive clones were used for screening with human ovarian cancer ascites extracts prepared as described above. A functional assay based on the luminescence of mitochondrial aequorin intracellular Ca\n2+\n release (Stables et al., 1997, \nAnal. Biochem. \n252:115-126; incorporated herein by reference) was performed as described (Detheux et al., 2000, \nJ. Exp. Med., \n192 1501-1508; incorporated herein by reference). Briefly, cells were collected from plates in PBS containing 5 mM EDTA, pelleted and resuspended at 5×10\n6 \ncells/ml in DMEM-F12 medium. Cells were incubated with 5 μM Coelenterazine H (Molecular Probes) for 4 hours at room temperature. Cells were then washed in DMEM-F12 medium and resuspended at a concentration of 0.5×10\n6 \ncells/ml. Cells were then mixed with test agonist peptides or plates containing tissue extracts and the light emission was recorded for 30 sec using a Microlumat luminometer (Perkin Elmer). Results are expressed as Relative Light Units (RLU).\n\n\n \nFIG. 17\n shows the concentration response curve for the truncated PreprocHEMERIN peptide (SEQ ID NO: 73, \nFIG. 16\n) to ChemerinR expressed in CHO cells. The assay was carried out as described in the preceeding paragraph. As shown in the figure, the truncated PreprocHEMERIN molecule activates ChemerinR with an EC\n50 \nof 4.27 nM. Results are expressed as Relative Light Units (RLU).\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nActivation of Cells Expressing ChemerinR by Recombinant Chemerin\n\n\nThe conditioned medium of COS-7, CHO-K1 and 293 T cells transfected with pcDNA3 encoding Chemerin or pcDNA3 alone, was collected and used for aequorin assays on CHO cells expressing ChemerinR. Results are shown in \nFIG. 14\n. Increasing amounts of conditioned supernatant resulted in an increase in luminescence in aequorin system cells expressing ChemerinR.\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nProduction of Antibodies Specific for Chemerin and ChemerinR\n\n\nAntibodies directed against Chemerin or ChemerinR were produced by repeated injections of plasmids encoding Chemerin or ChemerinR into mice. Sera were collected starting after the second injection and the titre and specificity of the antibodies was assessed by flow cytofluorometry with CHO-K1 cells transfected with the Chemerin or ChemerinR cDNA and CHO-K1 cells transfected with the cDNA of unrelated GPCR cDNA. Several sera were positive and were used for immunohistochemistry and other related applications, including flow cytometry analysis of human primary cells.\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies were obtained from immune mice by standard hybridoma technology using the NSO murine myeloma cell line as immortal partner. Supernatants were tested for anti ChemerinR antibody activity using the test used for assessing the antisera. Cells from the positive wells were expanded and frozen and the supernatants collected.\n\n\nIn particular, BALB/c mice were injected with 100 μg pcDNA-ChemerinR, or with the Chemerin C-terminal octapeptide FSKALPRS. Sera were tested by FACS on the CHO-ChemerinR cell line, or by ELISA for the Chemerin peptide, and immune mice were used to generate monoclonal antibodies by standard hybridoma technology, using the NSO myeloma cell line. The Ig class of selected hybridomas was determined with a mouse mAB isotyping kit (IsoStrip, Boehringer Mannheim).\n\n\n \nFIG. 15\n shows the results of experiments to characterize the antibodies raised against ChemerinR. A mixture of recombinant cells made up of ⅔ recombinant ChemerinR CHO cells and ⅓ mock-transfected CHO cells (negative control) was reacted with either a supernatant of cells expressing the anti ChemerinR 5C 1H2 monoclonal antibody (thick line) or a supernatant from cells with no known antibody activity (thin line, grey filling). After staining with FITC labeled anti mouse Ig these preparations were analyzed by flow cytofluorometry. Results are displayed as a histogram of the number of cells (Events axis) expressing a given fluorescence (FL1-H axis). Monoclonal 5C 1H2 allowed the discrimination of the ChemerinR recombinant sub-population of cells from the negative control cells, as evidenced by the relative proportions of both types of cells. The background fluorescence of the assay is given by the second staining (grey filling).\n\n\nThe ability of anti-chemerinR antibodies to block receptor activation by chemerin was investigated using the aequorin assay on chemerinR-expressing CHO-K1 cells. We found that two antibodies (4C7 and 1H2) were able to efficiently inhibit calcium mobilization promoted by recombinant chemerin, in a concentration-dependent manner (\nFIG. 26A\n).\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\nBinding Displacement Assay\n\n\nFor displacement experiments, ChemerinR-CHO-K1 cells (25,000 cells/tube) are incubated for 90 min. at 27° C. with 1 nM of SEAP-HIS6 or Chemerin-SEAP-HIS6 in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled Chemerin in 250 μl of binding buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.4; 1 mM Ca Cl\n2\n; 0.5% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) Fatty Acid-Free; 5 mM MgCl\n2\n). For saturation experiments, ChemerinR-CHO-K1 cells (25,000 cells/tube) are incubated for 90 min at 27° C. with increasing concentrations of Chemerin-SEAP-HIS6 in the presence or absence of 1 μM unlabeled Chemerin. After incubation, cells are washed 5 times and lysed in 50 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% triton X100. Samples are heated at 65° C. for 10 min to inactivate cellular phosphatases. Lysates are collected by centrifugation, and alkaline phosphatase activity in 25 μl of lysate is determined by the chemiluminescence assay described above.\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\nCompetition Binding Assay\n\n\nChemerinR expressing CHO-K1 cells were collected from plates with PBS supplemented with 5 mM EDTA, gently pelleted for 2 min at 1000×g, and resuspended in binding buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mM CaCl\n2\n, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.5% BSA). Competition binding assays were performed in Minisorb tubes (Nunc), using the \n125\nI-YHSFFFPGQFAFS (SEQ ID NO: 91) peptide as tracer (specific activity: 600 Ci/mmol, 50,000 cpm per tube), variable concentrations of competitors, and 500,000 cells in a final volume of 0.1 ml. Total binding was measured in the absence of competitor, and nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. Samples were incubated for 90 min at 27° C. and then bound tracer was separated by filtration through GF/B filters presoaked in 0.5% BSA. Filters were counted in a ®-scintillation counter. Binding parameters were determined with the PRISM software (Graphpad Software) using nonlinear regression applied to a one-site competition model.\n\n\nThe structure-function analysis of peptides derived from the C-terminus of chemerin allowed to design a bioactive peptide (YHSFFFPGQFAFS (SEQ ID NO: 91), EC\n50 \nof 28 nM on chemerinR-expressing CHO-K1 cells, using the aequorin-based assay) that could be labeled on its N-terminus tyrosine for binding studies. This iodinated peptide was used in a competition binding assay, using the unlabeled peptide or recombinant chemerin as competitors. As shown in \nFIG. 23C\n, the Ki values were estimated to 2.5±1.2 nM (pKi: 8.82±0.38) for recombinant Chemerin (filled circles) and 12.1±4.97 nM (pKi: 7.95±0.18) for the unlabel peptide (open square) (mean±s.e.m for 3 independent experiments).\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\nIntracellular Cascade Assays\n\n\nGTPγ\n35\nS binding to membranes of cells expressing human ChemR23 was performed as described previously (Kotani et al. 2000). Briefly, membranes (10 μg) from CHO-hChemR23 cells, pretreated or not with PTX) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in GTPγS binding buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 3μM GDP, 10 μg/ml saponin) containing different concentrations of peptides in 96 well microplates (Basic FlashPlates, New England Nuclear). [\n35\nS]-GTPγS (0.1 nM, Amersham-Pharmacia) was added, microplates were shaken for one minute and further incubated at 30° for 30 min. The incubation was stopped by centrifugation of the microplate for 10 min at 800 g and 4°, and aspiration of the supernatant. Microplates were counted in a TopCount (Packard, Downers, Ill.) for 1 min per well. Functional parameters were determined with the PRISM software (Graphpad Software) using nonlinear regression applied to a sigmoidal dose-response model.\n\n\nThe signaling pathways activated by chemerinR were investigated in CHO-K1 cells expressing the human receptor, but not G\nα16 \nor apoaequorin (CHO/chemerinR cells). Receptor activation was tested in a GTPγ[\n35\nS] binding assay, using membranes from CHO/chemerinR cells and human chemerin. The results show stimulation of ChemerinR expression CHO-K1 cells (EC50:7.8±0.4 nM, mean±s.e.m for 4 independent experiments, \nFIG. 23D\n). Furthermore, stimulation of these cells by human Chemerin at low nanomolar concentrations resulted in the release of intracellular calcium and inhibition of cAMP accumulation (not shown), as well as phosphorylation of the p42 and p44 MAP kinases (\nFIGS. 23\n E and F). All these effects were inhibited by Pertussis toxin pretreatment, demonstrating the involvement of G\ni \nfamily members. No activity of recombinant Chemerin or prochemerin was obtained in any of these assays on wild-type CHO-K1 cells (data not shown).\n\n\nExample 13\n\n\nTissue Distribution of Chemerin and ChemerinR\n\n\nSemi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using gene-specific primers to hCHEMERIN and ChemerinR on polyA+ RNA and total RNA from various human tissues (CLONTECH and Ambion). Briefly, total RNA from blood cells were prepared with Rneasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The hCHEMERIN primers were forward (5′-GCAGACAAGCTGCCGGA-3′; SEQ ID NO: 34), TaqMan probe (5′-AACCCGAGTGCAAAGTCAGGCCC-3′; SEQ ID NO: 36), and reverse (5′-AGTTTGATGCAGGCCAGGC-3′; SEQ ID NO: 35). The hChemerinR primers were forward (5′-GTCCCAGAACCACCGCAG-3′; SEQ ID NO: 37), TaqMan probe (5′-TTCGCCTGGCTTACATGGCCTGC-3′; SEQ ID NO: 39), and reverse (5′-AAGAAAGCCAGGACCCAGATG-3′; SEQ ID NO: 38). Primers designed to the housekeeping gene GAPDH Forward (5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′; SEQ ID NO: 40), TaqMan pobe (5′-AGCTCTCCCGCCGGCCTCTG-3′; SEQ ID NO: 42), and reverse (5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′; SEQ ID NO: 41) were used to produced reference mRNA profiles. The distribution of hCHEMERIN and ChemerinR in various tissues is shown in \nFIGS. 18 and 19\n, respectively. The level of expression of hCHEMERIN or ChemerinR are expressed as a ratio of hCHEMERIN or ChemerinR to GAPDH reference mRNA expression.\n\n\nExample 14\n\n\nExpression and Pharmacological Characterization of Human Chemerin\n\n\nThe recombinant Chemerin protein was purified by filtration through 0.45 μm Millex filters (Millipore) and separation through a cation-exchange HPLC column (Polycat 9.6×250 mm, Vydac, 0-1 M NaCl gradient in acetate buffer pH 5). The protein concentration in active fractions was determined following SDS/PAGE, by comparison with glutathione S-transferase and lysozyme standards after silver staining.\n\n\nHuman Chemerin cDNA was cloned and expressed in CHO-K1 cells. The bioactive recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity from conditioned medium, and analyzed by mass spectrometry and SDS/PAGE, which confirmed C-terminal truncation after serine 157 (not shown). A monoclonal antibody, generated against a peptide (FSKALPRS, SEQ ID NO: 89) corresponding to the predicted C-terminal sequence of the gene product, was used to purify to homogeneity from CHO-K1 conditioned medium, an unprocessed form of the protein (prochemerin), which was confirmed by mass spectrometry to retain the six C-terminal aminoacids (not shown). The amount of purified recombinant Chemerin (\nFIG. 23A\n) and prochemerin (not shown) was determined by comparison with protein standards, following SDS/PAGE and silver staining. It was inferred that over 90% of prochemerin released by CHO-K1 cells was enzymatically processed into Chemerin. Comparison of the biological activity of the two purified proteins assayed in parallel on CHO-K1 cells expressing human ChemerinR (\nFIG. 23B\n) demonstrated that processed Chemerin (filled circles) was about a hundred fold more active (EC50: 4.5±0.7 nM, mean±s.e.m. for 7 independent experiments) than unprocessed prochemerin (open circles) (EC50: 393±116 nM, mean±s.e.m. for 3 independent experiments). The N-terminus of prochemerin and Chemerin was determined by mass spectrometry: a tryptic peptide (ELTEAQR, 845.45 Da, SEQ ID NO: 90) corresponding to amino-\nacids\n 21 to 27 of preprochemerin was identified by sequencing (data not shown), confirming the signal peptide cleavage site predicted by the SignalP software from Expasy (available on the World Wide Web at cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). ChemerinR is structurally and evolutionary related to the C5a and C3a receptors, the prostaglandin D2 receptor CRTH2, and the orphan GPR1 receptor (20). These receptors, as well as a large set of other characterized and orphan receptors, including most chemokine receptors, were shown to be totally unreactive to purified human Chemerin (data not shown). The activation of ChemerinR by a set of over 200 bioactive molecules, including all currently available chemokines, C5a, C3a, fMLP, bradykinin, PAF and leukotrienes, was also tested. All these agents were unable to promote receptor activation even at concentrations significantly higher (100 nM or 1 mM) than those reported to activate their own receptors. Chemerin and its receptor appear therefore as a specific signaling system, in contrast to the situation prevailing with inflammatory chemokines and their respective receptors. In order to investigate whether proteolytic activation of prochemerin is performed intracellularly in the secretory pathway, or is an extracellular process, potentially regulated by the activation of extracellular proteases, we tested the activation of human purified prochemerin in the medium of cultured cells and conditioned media. We could show that human prochemerin can be fully converted into a form active on ChemerinR, during the incubation (at 100 nM) in the culture medium of hamster CHO-K1 cells, simian Cos-7 cells or human HEK293 cells (data not shown), as well as in conditioned media from these cells (\nFIG. 24A\n). These data indicate that prochemerin processing is performed extracellularly, and that the active Chemerin product is not degraded further by the proteolytic activity, and is therefore stable in extracellular medium. Although the protease responsible for this processing is not known, the regulation of this enzyme activity is expected to control the extracellular generation of active Chemerin in vivo.\n\n\nExample 15\n\n\nHigh Affinity Activation of ChemerinR by C-Terminus Truncated Peptide of Chemerin\n\n\nIn order to investigate the potential effect of peptides derived from the C-terminal domain of prochemerin, we first synthesized several peptides starting at position 139 of prochemerin, after the last cysteine (Table 2), and tested their ability to trigger intracellular calcium release in a cell line coexpressing the Chemerin receptor and apoaequorin, WE have use the arquorin assay as previously described in Detheux et al. (2000 \nJ. Exp. Med. \n192, 1501-1508). As shown in \nFIG. 25A\n and Table 2, the peptide corresponding to the C-terminal end of prochemerin (hProchemerin-25) was not able to activate the receptor under high concentration (mean EC\n50 \nof 160±21 μM), whereas the same peptide lacking the 6 last amino-acids (hChemerin-19) activated the Chemerin receptor with very high affinity (mean EC\n50 \nof 16.7±3.2 nM). As described before, the recombinant prochemerin was poorly active (mean EC\n50 \nof 393±116 nM) compared to the affinity of the processed recombinant Chemerin (mean EC\n50 \nof 4.5±0.7 nM). These results are consistent with the previously data showing the functional importance of the C-terminal processing of the prochemerin, which allows the transformation of a low affinity precursor to a high affinity form of the ligand. Surprisingly, these data also suggest that a sequence corresponding to the last 19 C-terminus amino acids of Chemerin seems to be sufficient for providing high affinity receptor activation.\n\n\nTo study the accuracy of the processing of the immature form of Chemerin, we further investigated the effect of C-terminal truncated peptides variants (Table 2). As shown in \nFIG. 25B\n and Table 2, addition of a single amino-acid (h[Lys-20] Chemerin-19) to the C-terminal end of the control peptide strongly affected the affinity (EC\n50 \nof 170 μM compared to a value of 16.7±3.2 nM for hChemerin-19). The same effect was observed after removal of at least 2 amino-acids (h[Phe18Ser19] Chemerin-19, EC\n50 \nof 220 μM; h[Ala17Phe18Ser19] Chemerin-19, EC\n50 \nof 130±10 μM). However, removal of only one amino-acid slightly impaired the response (h[Ser19] Chemerin-19, EC\n50\n=97±13 nM). From these data, the C-terminal end of the Chemerin appeared to be extremely precise, as addition of only one amino acid abrogated the high affinity intracellular calcium response. We also showed the functional importance of the Phenylalanine residue in \nposition\n 18 and, more slightly, the Serine in \nposition\n 19. Thus, C-terminal modification of the Chemerin seriously impaired the high affinity activation of its receptor, demonstrating the accuracy of the activating cleavage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EC\n50\n value of the truncated Chemerin peptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO\n\n\nPeptide (name and sequence)\n\n\nMean EC50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\nHuman prochemerin-25\n\n\n  160 ± 21 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFAFSKALPRS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n\nHuman Chemerin-19\n\n\n 16.7 ± 3.2 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\nHuman [Lys20] Chemerin-19\n\n\n170 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFAFSK\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n\nHuman [ΔSer19] Chemerin-19\n\n\n   97 ± 13 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFAF\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n56\n\n\nHuman [ΔPhe18Ser19] Chemerin-19\n\n\n220 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFA\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n57\n\n\nHuman [ΔAla17Phe18Ser19] \n\n\n  130 ± 10 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nChemerin-19\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQRAGEDPHSFYFPGQF\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n58\n\n\nHuman [ΔPhe16Ala17Phe18Ser19] \n\n\ninactif\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nChemerin-19\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQRAGEDPHSFYFPGQ\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\nHuman Chemerin-7\n\n\n  220 ± 100 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\nHuman Chemerin-8\n\n\n    2 ± 1 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\nHuman Chemerin-9\n\n\n    7 ± 0.25 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYFPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n62\n\n\nHuman Chemerin-10\n\n\n  8.2 ± 2 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFYFPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\nHuman Chemerin-12\n\n\n 12.2 ± 3.4 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHSFYFPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n64\n\n\nHuman Chemerin-13\n\n\n 14 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPHSFYFPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n65\n\n\nHuman [Ala-1] Chemerin-9\n\n\n  496 ± 80 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAFPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n66\n\n\nHuman [Ala-2] Chemerin-9\n\n\n155.3 ± 41.6 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYAPGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n67\n\n\nHuman [Ala-3] Chemerin-9\n\n\n 42.5 ± 7.5 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYFAGQFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n\nHuman [Ala-5] Chemerin-9\n\n\n 35.8 ± 5.9 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYFPGAFAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n\nHuman [Ala-6] Chemerin-9\n\n\n    5 ± 1 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYFPGQAAFS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n70\n\n\nHuman [Ala-8] Chemerin-9\n\n\n   38 ± 7 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYFPGQFAAS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n71\n\n\nHuman [Ala-9] Chemerin-9\n\n\n 48.3 ± 5.7 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYFPGQFAFA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 16\n\n\nThe Shorter C-Terminal Nonapeptide YFPGQFAFS has a High Affinity on ChemerinR\n\n\nWe then determined the minimum length of the C-terminal fragment able to activate the Chemerin receptor with high potency. Successive truncations of the N-terminal domain of the hChemerin-19 peptide were synthesized and tested using the aequorin assay (\nFIG. 25C\n). Truncations from \nresidue\n 1 to residue 10 (hChemerin-17 to hChemerin-9, \nFIG. 20\n and EC\n50 \nvalues in table 2) did not affect intracellular calcium signaling. However, removal of the Tyrosine residue in position 11 (hChemerin-8) resulted in a severely loss of affinity for the receptor (EC\n50 \nof 2±1 μM compared to a value of 16.7±3.2 nM for the control peptide: Human chemerin-19), and the response was completely abrogated for shorter peptide (hChemerin-7, EC\n50 \nof 220±100 μM). These results indicated that only the last 9 amino acids of Chemerin are necessary for high affinity receptor activation, as the EC\n50 \nof the nonapeptide is 7±0.25 nM, which is in the same range to the affinity of the recombinant Chemerin.\n\n\nExample 17\n\n\nAromatic residues in Chemerin C-Terminus are Necessary for ChemerinR Activiation\n\n\nSince multiple residues within the last 9 amino acids sequence of Chemerin appeared to be important for receptor activation, we examined the relative contribution of each amino acid of the YFPGQFAFS peptide in Chemerin receptor activation, by using an alanine-scanning mutagenesis approach. Eight different alanine-substituted hChemerin-9 analogs were synthesized and tested for intracellular calcium accumulation. As shown in \nFIG. 25D\n and Table 2, the EC\n50 \nof the Q5A, P3A and S9A mutated peptides was shifted to higher concentrations (EC\n50 \nof 35.8±5.9 nM, 42.5±7.5 nM and 48.3±5.7 nM respectively) as compared with the control peptide (mean EC\n50 \nof 7±0.25 nM). The EC\n50 \nof the F2A and Y1A peptides was more severely affected (EC\n50 \nof 155.3±41.6 nM and 496±80 nM, respectively), and alanine substitution of \nPhe\n 6 and \nPhe\n 8 dramatically impaired the functional response of Chemerin receptor (EC\n50 \nof 5±1 μM and 38±7 μM, respectively). These data suggested that aromatic Y1, F2, F6 and F8 residues play an important role in receptor activation.\n\n\nExample 18\n\n\nChemotaxis and Ca\n2+\n Mobilization Assays on Primary Cells\n\n\nMonocyte-derived DCs were generated by GM-CSF (50 ng/ml) and IL-13 (20 ng/ml) stimulation as previously described (17). Maturation of DCs was achieved following stimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS. Macrophages were obtained by incubating monocytes in Petriperm dishes (Haereus) for 6 days in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS and 10 ng/ml MCSF. Cell migration was evaluated using a 48-well microchemotaxis chamber technique as described (18). For Ca2+ mobilization assays, monocyte-derived DCs or macrophages (10\n7 \ncells/ml in HBSS without phenol red but containing 0.1% BSA) were loaded with 5 μM FURA-2 (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37° C. in the dark. The loaded cells were washed twice, resuspended at 10\n6 \ncells/ml, kept for 30 min at 4° C. in the dark with or without the blocking 4C7 monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml), and transferred into the quartz cuvette of a luminescence spectrometer LS50B (PerkinElmer). Ca\n2+\n mobilization in response to recombinant Chemerin was measured by recording the ratio of fluorescence emitted at 510 nm after sequential excitation at 340 and 380 nm.\n\n\nThe biological function of Chemerin was further investigated on leukocyte populations. In accordance to the coupling of human ChemerinR through the G i class of G proteins, its structural relatedness to chemoattractant receptors, and its expression in antigen-presenting cells, we showed that Chemerin acted as a chemotactic factor for these cells. Dendritic cells and macrophages were differentiated in vitro from human monocytes. Human recombinant Chemerin promoted in vitro migration of macrophages and immature dendritic cells (\nFIGS. 26\n B, C, and F), whereas no chemotaxis of mature dendritic cells was observed (data not shown). Maximal chemotactic responses were obtained for concentrations of 100 pM to 1 nM, according to the batch of recombinant Chemerin. Such bell-shaped chemotactic response, with a maximum corresponding to concentrations below the EC50 observed in other functional assays, is typically observed for other chemotactic factors such as chemokines. The effect was completely abolished following treatment with Pertussis toxin (\nFIGS. 26\n C and F), demonstrating the involvement of the G i class of G proteins. Migration of macrophages and dendritic cells was also inhibited by the antiChemerinR monoclonal antibody 4C7 (\nFIGS. 26\n C and F) without affecting RANTESinduced cell migration, demonstrating that the effect is specifically mediated by the ChemerinR. A checkerboard analysis showed that, when equal concentrations of Chemerin were present in both the lower and upper wells, no significant increase in cell migration was observed (\nFIGS. 26\n C and F). Thus, the migration of macrophages and immature dendritic cells induced by Chemerin is essentially a chemotactic effect rather than chemokinesis. We also investigated whether recombinant Chemerin could induce Ca\n2+\n mobilization in antigen-presenting cells. As expected, intracellular Ca\n2+\n levels increased in immature dendritic cells in response to recombinant Chemerin (\nFIG. 26D\n), whereas the 4C7 antibody inhibited the Ca2+ response (\nFIG. 26E\n). Similar observations were made for macrophages (\nFIGS. 26\n G and H).\n\n\nExample 19\n\n\nBioactive Chemerin Concentration in Human Samples\n\n\nIn order to investigate whether chemerin is frequently generated in pathological situations in human, we fractionated a set of inflammatory fluids and assayed the chemerin content by measuring the biological activity of the fractions on chemerinR, as compared to a standard curve made with purified recombinant chemerin. Significant levels of active chemerin, well within the active range (33 to 358 ng/ml, corresponding to 2 to 23 nM), were found in the majority of ascitic fluids resulting from ovary cancer, but also in ascitic fluids resulting from a liver cancer and from an ovary hyperstimulation syndrome, as well as in a pool of articular fluids from arthritic patients (Table 3). Interestingly, active chemerin was not detected in articular fluid pooled from patients with arthrosis (Table 3), nor in fractions from human hemofiltrate (not shown), demonstrating that its presence is linked to inflammatory situations.\n\n\nThe amount of Chemerin in ascitic (samples 1-17) and articular (\nsamples\n 18 and 19) fluids was estimated following two fractionation steps, by assaying the fractions on ChemerinR-expressing cells, using the aequorin-based assay and a standard curve made with purified recombinant human Chemerin. Articular fluids from arthritis and arthrosis patients were pooled for measurement, following centrifugation. 0. H.

Clones were characterized by assaying the conditioned medium on chemerinRexpres sing cells. In vitro proliferation rate was determined by BrdU incorporation as described30. For in vivo studies, cells were washed twice with PBS, and grafted (6×10\n5 \ncells in 0.1 ml PBS) subcutaneously into the back of 10-week-old C57B16 mice (5 to 11 mice per group, Harlan, The Netherlands). Perpendicular tumor diameters (D and d) were measured every 2 days, and the volume was estimated as V=π(d/2)(D/2)(d/2). Statistical analysis was performed by using the unpaired non parametric Mann-Whitney test. For microscopic analysis, tumors were embedded in OCT, snap-frozen in −80° C. isopentane and cut at 12 μm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) for routine analysis. All animal procedures were approved by the ethical committee of the Medical School of the Universite Libre de Bruxelles.\n\n\nThe biological function of Chemerin was further investigated in a mouse model in vivo. In accordance to the coupling of human ChemerinR through the G\n1 \nclass of G proteins, its structural relatedness to chemoattractant receptors, and its expression in dendritic cells, Chemerin acted as a chemotactic factor for these cells. Dendritic cells were differentiated in vitro from human monocytes. Human recombinant Chemerin was chemotactic in vitro for immature, but not mature, dendritic cells, with a maximal activity at 1 nM (See example 18 of the present application).\n\n\nAs active Chemerin was originally isolated from tumoral ascitis, we evaluated the significance of this expression in a tumor context, by investigating the consequence of Chemerin expression in a mouse tumor model in vivo. The mouse prochemerin and ChemerinR cDNAs were cloned. Following their expression in CHO-K1 cells, functional assays demonstrated that the human and mouse recombinant ligands were equally active on both the human and mouse receptors (data not shown). The melanoma cell line B16F0 was transfected with a bicistronic expression vector containing the mouse Chemerin cDNA (or a control vector), and stable cell lines were established. The expression of bioactive Chemerin was confirmed by measuring the activity of conditioned medium. The two selected cell lines released over a period of 24 hours about 125 ng/ml active Chemerin in the culture medium. Expression of Chemerin did not modify the growth rate of the cell lines, as assessed by measuring the proportion of cells in the various phases of the cell cycle (\nFIGS. 27A-C\n), or by directly counting cells over time (data not shown). However, following subcutaneous graft of the cells to syngenic mice, the phenotype of the developing tumors was profoundly modified by Chemerin expression. In three independent series, all mice receiving wild-type B 16F0 cells developed a rapidly growing tumor, in accordance with the literature, while a number of mice receiving Chemerin-expressing cells did not develop tumors up to four weeks after the graft. By combining the three series, 5 out of 24 mice grafted with Chemerin-expressing cells did not develop tumors (versus 0/24 in the control group, p<0.05, Fisher test). The size of the developing tumors was also much smaller for the Chemerin group (an average reduction of 70% 21-24 days after the graft of cells, \nFIG. 27D\n). The difference was significant from \nday\n 10 after the graft (p=0.02 to 0.004 according to time points, non-parametric Mann-Whitney test). Macroscopic analysis at the end of the observation period (12 to 30 days) revealed a number of phenotypic differences between the two groups. Chemerin-producing tumors were characterized by a more abundant vascularization, and a much lower extent of necrotic areas. These phenotypic differences were not the consequence of a difference in the size of the tumors, as they were observed as well following the selection of rare size-matched tumors belonging to the two groups. Microscopic analysis, following hematoxylin-eosin staining, confirmed these observations, particularly the major difference in the extent of necrosis, that occupies the largest part of control tumors, while being rare in Chemerin-producing tumors (\nFIGS. 27\n E and F).\n\n\nExample 21\n\n\nCalcium Flux\n\n\nThe Aequoscreen™ Assay\n\n\nChemerinR expressing clones were transfected to coexpress mithochondrial apoaequorin and Gα16. Cells in mid-log phase, grown in media without \nantibiotics\n 18 hours prior to the test, were detached by gentle flushing with PBS-EDTA (5 mM EDTA), recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in “BSA medium” (DMEM/HAM's F12 with HEPES, without phenol red+0.1% BSA). Cells were then counted, centrifuged and resuspended in a 15 ml Falcon tube at a concentration of 1×10\n6 \ncells/ml.\n\n\nCoelenterazine h (Molecular Probes, cat No. C-6780, stock solution: 500 μM in Methanol) was added to the cells in suspension at a final concentration of 5 μM.\n\n\nThe Falcon tube, wrapped in aluminium foil, was then placed on a vertical rotating wheel and incubated at room temperature (temperature should be maintained below 22° C.) overnight in order to reconstitute active aequorin.\n\n\nCells were then diluted 1/10 in “BSA-medium” and incubated as described above for 60 min. Reference ligands were diluted in “BSA-medium” and distributed in a 96-well plate (50 μl/well). For each measurement, 50 μl of cells (i.e. 5 000 cells) were injected into each well of the plate containing the ligands, and the emitted light is recorded (FDSS, Hamamatsu) during 20 seconds following cells injection. Results were expressed as Relative Light Units (RLU). Digitonin (50 μM, Sigma, cat no 37006) is used as positive controls of the cell response.\n\n\nThe intensity of the emitted light was integrated, yielding for each well one value representative of the emitted light.\n\n\nExample 22\n\n\nAromatic and Hydrophobic Residues in N-Terminus of the Nonapeptide YFPGQFAFS are Necessary for ChemerinR Activation\n\n\nIn order to investigate the importance of the N-terminus part of the nonapetpide YFPGQFAFS, several peptides were synthesized and tested using the Calcium flux-Aequoscreen assay. As shown in \nFIGS. 28 to 32\n and Table 4, peptides containing an aromatic or hydrophobic residue on position N1 and N2 are in the same range of activity of the recombinant Chemerin. These data suggested that aromatic and hydrophobic residues play an important role in receptor activation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEC50 value of the peptides modified by hydrophobic \n\n\n\n\n\n\nresidue (N-terminus) and EC50 value of the\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeptide modified in \nposition\n 9 by an Aspartate \n\n\n\n\n\n\nresidue and an amide function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO.\n\n\nSequence\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n92\n\n\nLFPGQFAFS\n\n\n66.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n93\n\n\nIFPGQFAFS\n\n\n25.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n94\n\n\nFLPGQFAFS\n\n\n29.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n95\n\n\nYLPGQFAFS\n\n\n3.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n96\n\n\nYVPGQFAFS\n\n\n43.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n97\n\n\nYFPGQFAFD-CONH2\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 23\n\n\nModification of the C terminal Part of the Nonapeptide YFPGQFAFS\n\n\nIn order to clarify the role of the C-terminal part in the interaction with ChemerinR, the Serine on \nposition\n 9 was mutated by an Aspartate residue and the carboxylic group on the C-term was replaced by an amide function.

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThe present application is a 35 U.S.C. §371 National Stage patent application of International patent application PCT/JP2008/055474, filed on Mar. 25, 2008, which claims priority to Japanese patent application JP 2007-078315, filed on Mar. 26, 2007.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a pharmaceutical, and particularly a compound useful as a therapeutic agent for chronic renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy.\n\n\nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\nPGE2 is known as one of the metabolites in an arachidonic acid cascade. The PGE2 exhibits various activities such as a pain inducing and increasing action, a pro- or anti-inflammatory action, an uterine contractile action, a digestive peristalsis promoting action, an awaking action, a suppressive effect on gastric acid secretion, a hypotensive action, a platelet aggregation inhibition action, a bone-resorption promoting action, an angiogenic action, and the like.\n\n\nPGE2 receptors are divided into four subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4, which have a wide distribution in various tissues. The activation of the EP 1 receptor is believed to increase intracellular Ca\n2+\n. The EP3 receptor is one of the receptors having different routes for second-messenger systems. Further, the activation of the EP2 and EP4 receptors is believed to cause the activation of an adenylate cyclase, and thus increase the intracellular cAMP level. Especially, the EP4 receptor is considered to be associated with smooth muscle relaxation, pro- or anti-inflammatory reactions, lymphocyte differentiation, mesangial cell relaxation or proliferation, gastric or enteric mucus secretion, or the like.\n\n\nThe inhibitors of the PGE2 receptor, that is, the “PGE2 antagonists”, exhibit binding activities to the PGE2 receptors. That is, the PGE2 antagonists exhibit a PGE2-antagonistic or PGE2-inhibiting action. Therefore, the PGE2 antagonists are expected as pharmaceuticals to treat PGE2-mediated diseases. It is expected that these PGE2 antagonists can be used as therapeutic drugs to treat EP4 receptors-related diseases, such as renal diseases, inflammatory diseases, various pains, or the like, by acting on the EP4 receptors, in humans or animals.\n\n\nAs a compound having a PGE2 antagonistic action, there has been reported a compound represented by the following formula, and particularly, such a compound is useful as an EP4 receptor agonist (Patent Document 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(wherein particularly X represents —CO— or lower alkylene, R\n5 \nrepresents H or lower alkyl, and R\n2 \nrepresents lower alkyl or aryl which may be substituted. Refer to the following publication for the details.)\n\n\n[Patent Document 1] Pamphlet of International Publication No. WO 2005/061475\n\n\nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nProblem that the Invention is to Solve\n\n\nIt is an object of the present invention to provide a novel pharmaceutical having a selective antagonistic action to an EP4 receptor, and particularly a novel compound useful as a therapeutic agent for chronic renal insufficiency and diabetic nephropathy.\n\n\nMeans for Solving the Problem\n\n\nAt first, the present applicants have made studies on a compound having an antagonistic action against an EP4 receptor, and as a result, they have found that the compound as disclosed in Patent Document 1 has a good antagonistic action against an EP4 receptor.

At this time, depending on the types of the functional groups, it is in some cases effective from the viewpoint of the production techniques to substitute the functional group with an appropriate protecting group (a group which is capable of being easily converted into the functional group), during the steps from starting materials to intermediates. Examples of such a functional group include an amino group, a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, and the like, and examples of the protecting group thereof include those as described in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (3\nrd \nedition, 1999)”, edited by Greene and Wuts, and the like, which may be appropriately selected and used depending on the reaction conditions. In these methods, a desired compound can be obtained by introducing the protecting group to carry out the reaction, and then, if desired, removing the protecting group.\n\n\nIn addition, the prodrug of the compound of the formula (I) can be prepared by introducing a specific group during the steps from starting materials to intermediates, in the same manner as for the afore-mentioned protecting groups, or by carrying out the reaction using the obtained compound of the formula (I).

Examples of the condensing agent include, but are not limited to, 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-1-ium-3-oxaide hexafluorophosphate (HATU), 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (WSC), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), diphenylphosphoryl azide, phosphorus oxychloride, and the like. It is favorable for the reaction in some cases to use an additive (for example, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), and the like) in some cases. It may be advantageous in some cases for the smooth progress of the reaction to carry out the reaction in the presence of an organic salt such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), N-methylmorpholine, and the like, or an inorganic salt such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium hydroxide, and the like.\n\n\nFurther, a method in which the compound (II) is derived into a reactive derivative thereof, and then the reactive derivative is reacted with the compound (III) can also be used. Here, examples of the reactive derivative of the carboxylic acid include oxyhalides obtained by the reaction of a halogenating agent such as phosphorus oxychloride, thionyl chloride, and the like, mixed acid anhydrides such as isobutyl chloroformate, and the like, active esters obtained by condensation with HOBt, and the like. The reaction of the reactive derivative and the compound (III) can be carried out, from under cooling to under heating, preferably at −20° C. to 60° C., in a solvent which is inert to the reaction, such as halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, and the like.\n\n\n(Production Process 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe present production process is a method for obtaining a compound (I-b) of the present invention by carrying out the amidation of an amine (IV) and a carboxylic acid (V). The amidation can be carried out by using various reaction conditions represented by the above-described Production Process 1\n\n\n(Production Process 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(wherein L represents a leaving group, preferably Cl or a 4-nitrophenoxy group).\n\n\nFurther, the compound (I-a) of the present invention can be prepared by reacting a compound (VI) with a compound (VII) or a compound (VIII). In the case of using the compound (VII), production can be made by using the same condition as the above-described Production Process 1. Further, in the case of using the compound (VIII), the reaction can be carried out using the compound (VI) and the compound (VIII) in equivalent amounts or either thereof in an excessive amount, from under cooling to heating under reflux, preferably at 0° C. to 80° C. usually stirring for 0.1 hour to 5 days, in a solvent which is inert to the reaction or without a solvent. Here, the solvent is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, halogenated hydrocarbons, DMF, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile as shown in Production Process 1, or a mixture thereof. It may be advantageous in some cases for the smooth progress of the reaction to carry out the reaction in the presence of an organic base such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, and the like, or an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium hydroxide, and the like.\n\n\nAs the compound (VIII), various alkyl chloroformates or alkyl 4-nitrophenylcarbamates can be used. The alkyl 4-nitrophenylcarbamate can be prepared by performing a reaction using 4-nitrophenyl chlorocarbamate and a corresponding alcohol in equivalent amounts or either thereof in an excessive amount at −20° C. to 80° C. usually for about 0.1 hour to 1 day, from under cooling to under heating, in the presence of a base, in a solvent which is inert to the reaction.\n\n\nFurther, in the compound (I-a) and the compound (I-b) of the present invention, by hydrolysis at an ester site with an acid or an alkali, or by removal of the protecting group of a carboxylic acid, the compound of the formula (I) in which the R site is H can be obtained.\n\n\n(Production Process 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe present production process is a method for obtaining a compound (I-c) of the present invention by reacting a compound (IX) with a compound (X).\n\n\nThe reaction is carried out by using the compound (IX) and the compound (X) in equivalent amounts or either thereof in an excessive amount at −45° C. to heating under reflux in the presence of a reducing agent in a solvent which is inert to the reaction, and in an embodiment, by stirring it at 0° C. to room temperature, usually for 0.1 hour to 5 days. Here, the solvent is not particularly limited, but examples thereof include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and the like, ethers, or a mixture thereof. Examples of the reducing agent include sodium cyanoborohydride, triacetoxy sodium borohydride, sodium borohydride, and the like. It is preferable in some cases to carry out the reaction in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as molecular sieves, and the like or an acid such as acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, a titanium (IV) isopropoxide complex, and the like. Depending on the reaction, when an imine compound formed as an intermediate in the reaction system may be stably isolated, a reducing reaction may be separately carried out after obtaining the imine compound. Further, the reaction can be carried out in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, and the like, in the presence or absence of an acid such as acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and the like, using a reduction catalyst (for example, palladium-carbon, Raney nickel, and the like), instead of treatment with the reducing agent. In this case, it is preferable to carry out the reaction under a hydrogen atmosphere at normal pressure to 50 atmospheres under heating from 0° C.\n\n\n(Production Process 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(wherein Ar means aryl which may be substituted or a hetero ring which may be substituted.

The cells were counted and seeded on a 15 cm collagen-coated dish to a confluence of 70%. The next day, to an Opti-MEM culture medium at 1.2 mL/dish was added Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at 60 μL/dish, followed by being left to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes. A plasmid in which a rat EP4 (alignment number 1) had been inserted into a TA cloning site of pcDNA3.1-V5-His-topo was added thereto to 15 μg/dish. After leaving it to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes, the resultant was added to the dish, and cultured for 20 to 24 hours. The cell culture was carried out in a CO\n2 \nincubator (37° C., 5% CO\n2\n).\n\n\nPreparation of Membrane Fraction\n\n\nThe culture medium was removed by suction, 10 mL of cooled PBS was added thereto per 15 cm dish, and the cells were scraped using a cell scraper (Sumitomo Bakelite).

Then, it was homogenized using a Polytron and the homogenate was centrifuged (26,000 rpm, 20 min, 4° C.). The obtained precipitate was resuspended in cooled 20 mM Tris-HCl, and homogenized again using a Polytron, and the homogenate was centrifuged (26,000 rpm, 20 min, 4° C.). The obtained precipitate was resuspended in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5; Dojindo Laboratories) to 1 mL per dish, homogenized again using a Polytron, and freeze-stored at −80° C. as a membrane fraction. At this time, a part thereof was used for the measurement of the protein concentration. Measurement of the protein concentration was carried out using a Bio-Rad Protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) in accordance with the appended standard Protocol in duplicate.\n\n\nBinding Assay\n\n\n[\n3\nH] PGE2 50 μL (final concentration 0.3 nM; Perkin Elmer), 100 μL (20 μg/well) of a membrane fraction prepared from the rat EP4 expression cell, and 50 μL of a test compound were mixed in a 96-well microplate (Sumitomo Bakelite), incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, then filtered by suction on a UniFilter-96 GF/B (Perkin Elmer) using a FilterMate Harvester (Perkin Elmer), and washed three times with 300 μL/well of a cooled assay buffer. Dilution of [\n3\nH]PGE2 and the membrane fraction was carried out using an assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n), and dilution of the test compound and the unlabeled PGE2 was carried out using DMSO and an assay buffer. Further, in the case of the addition of a human serum albumin (HSA), dilution was carried out using an assay buffer containing 4% HSA (final concentration 1%; Sigma). The UniFilter-96 GF/B was treated by preliminarily washing twice with 200 μL/well of a cooled assay buffer. The UniFilter-96 GF/B after filtration was dried in a dryer overnight, 50 μL/well of MicroScint20 (Perkin Elmer) was added thereto, and then the radioactivity was measured using a TopCount (Perkin Elmer).

No. 61/139,361 filed Dec. 19, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/061,943 filed Jun. 16, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/066,632 filed Feb. 20, 2008, which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to specific binding agents that recognize and bind to angiopoietins-1 (Ang-1) and/or angiopoetin-2 (Ang-2). More specifically, the invention relates to the production, diagnostic use, and therapeutic use of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, and the antigen-binding fragments thereof, which specifically bind Ang-1 and/or Ang-2. Aspects of the invention also relate to hybridomas or other cell lines expressing such antibodies. The described antibodies are useful for diagnostics and for the treatment of diseases associated with the activity and overproduction of Ang-1 or Ang-2.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nAngiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing ones, is essential to many physiological and pathological processes. Normally, angiogenesis is tightly regulated by pro- and anti-angiogenic factors, but in the case of diseases such as cancer, ocular neovascular diseases, arthritis, and psoriasis, the process can go awry. Folkman, \nJ., Nat. Med., \n1:27-31 (1995).\n\n\nThere are a number of diseases known to be associated with deregulated or undesired angiogenesis. Such diseases include, but are not limited to, ocular neovascularisation, such as retinopathies, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, psoriasis, hemangioblastoma, hemangioma, arteriosclerosis, inflammatory disease, such as a rheumatoid or rheumatic inflammatory disease, especially arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis), or other chronic inflammatory disorders, such as chronic asthma, arterial or post-transplantational atherosclerosis, endometriosis, and neoplastic diseases, for example so-called solid tumors and liquid (or hematopoietic) tumors (such as leukemias and lymphomas). Other diseases associated with undesired angiogenesis will be apparent to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nAlthough many signal transduction systems have been implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis, one of the best-characterized and most endothelial cell-selective systems involves the Tie-2 receptor tyrosine kinase (referred to as “Tie-2” or “Tie-2R” (also referred to as “ORK”); murine Tie-2 is also referred to as “tek”) and its ligands, the angiopoietins (Gale, N. W. and Yancopoulos, G. D., \nGenes Dev. \n13:1055-1066 [1999]). There are 4 known angiopoietins; angiopoietin-1 (“Ang-1”) through angiopoietin-4 (“Ang-4”). These angiopoietins are also referred to as “Tie-2 ligands”. (Davis, S., et al., \nCell, \n87:1161-1169 [1996]; Grosios, K., et al., \nCytogenet Cell Genet, \n84:118-120 [1999]; Holash, J., et al., \nInvestigative Ophthalmology \n& \nVisual Science, \n42:1617-1625 [1999]; Koblizek, T. I., et al., \nCurrent Biology, \n8:529-532 [1998]; Lin, P., et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA, \n95:8829-8834 [1998]; Maisonpierre, P. C., et al., \nScience, \n277:55-60 [1997]; Papapetropoulos, A., et al., \nLab Invest, \n79:213-223 [1999]; Sato, T. N., et al., \nNature, \n375:70-74 [1998]; Shyu, K. G., et al., \nCirculation, \n98:2081-2087 [1998]; Suri, C., et al., \nCell, \n87:1171-1180 [1996]; Suri, C., et al., \nScience, \n282:468-471 [1998]; Valenzuela, D. M., et al., \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, \n96:1904-1909 [1999]; Witzenbichler, B., et al., \nJ Biol Chem, \n273:18514-18521 [1998]). Whereas Ang-1 binding to Tie-2 stimulates receptor phosphorylation in cultured endothelial cells, Ang-2 has been observed to both agonize and antagonize Tie-2 receptor phosphorylation (Davis, S., et al., [1996], supra; Maisonpierre, P. C., et al., [1997], supra; Kim, I., J. H. Kim, et al., \nOncogene \n19(39): 4549-4552 (2000); Teichert-Kuliszewska, K., P. C. Maisonpierre, et al., \nCardiovascular Research \n49(3): 659-70 (2001)).\n\n\nThe phenotypes of mouse Tie-2 and Ang-1 knockouts are similar and suggest that Ang-1-stimulated Tie-2 phosphorylation mediates remodeling and stabilization of developing vessels in utero through maintenance of endothelial cell-support cell adhesion (Dumont, D. J., et al., \nGenes \n& \nDevelopment, \n8:1897-1909 [1994]; Sato, T. N., et al., \nNature, \n376:70-74 [1995]; Suri, C., et al., [1996], supra). The role of Ang-1 in vessel stabilization is thought to be conserved in the adult, where it is expressed widely and constitutively (Hanahan, D., \nScience, \n277:48-50 [1997]; Zagzag, D., et al., \nExperimental Neurology, \n159:391-400 [1999]). In contrast, Ang-2 expression is primarily limited to sites of vascular remodeling, where it is thought to block Ang-1 function, thereby inducing a state of vascular plasticity conducive to angiogenesis (Hanahan, D., [1997], supra; Holash, J., et al., \nScience, \n284:1994-1998 [1999]; Maisonpierre, P. C., et al., [1997], supra).\n\n\nNumerous published studies have purportedly demonstrated vessel-selective Ang-2 expression in disease states associated with angiogenesis. These pathological conditions include, for example, psoriasis, macular degeneration, and cancer (Bunone, G., et al., \nAmerican Journal of Pathology, \n155:1967-1976 [1999]; Etoh, T., et al., \nCancer Research, \n61:2145-2153 [2001]; Hangai, M., et al., \nInvestigative Ophthalmology \n& \nVisual Science, \n42:1617-1625 [2001]; Holash, J., et al., [1999] supra; Kuroda, K., et al., \nJournal of Investigative Dermatology, \n116:713-720 [2001]; Otani, A., et al., \nInvestigative Ophthalmology \n& \nVisual Science, \n40:1912-1920 [1999]; Stratmann, A., et al., \nAmerican Journal of Pathology, \n153:1459-1466 [1998]; Tanaka, S., et al., \nJ Clin Invest, \n103:34-345 [1999]; Yoshida, Y., et al., \nInternational Journal of Oncology, \n15:1221-1225 [1999]; Yuan, K., et al., \nJournal of Periodontal Research, \n35:165-171 [2000]; Zagzag, D., et al., supra). Most of these studies have focused on cancer, in which many tumor types appear to display vascular Ang-2 expression. In contrast with its expression in pathological angiogenesis, Ang-2 expression in normal tissues is extremely limited (Maisonpierre, P. C., et al., [1997], supra; Mezquita, J., et al., \nBiochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, \n260:492-498 [1999]). In the normal adult, the three main sites of angiogenesis are the ovary, placenta, and uterus; these are the primary tissues in normal (i.e., non-cancerous) tissues in which Ang-2 mRNA has been detected.\n\n\nCertain functional studies suggest that Ang-2 may be involved in tumor angiogenesis. Ahmad et al. (\nCancer Res., \n61:1255-1259 [2001]) describe Ang-2 over-expression and show that it is purportedly associated with an increase in tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. See also Etoh et al., supra, and Tanaka et al., supra, wherein data is presented purportedly associating Ang-2 over expression with tumor hypervascularity. However, in contrast, Yu et al. (\nAm. J. Path., \n158:563-570 [2001]) report data to show that overexpression of Ang-2 in Lewis lung carcinoma and TA3 mammary carcinoma cells purportedly prolonged the survival of mice injected with the corresponding transfectants.\n\n\nIn the past few years, various publications have suggested Ang-1, Ang-2 and Tie-2 as a possible target for anti-cancer therapy. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,166,185, 5,650,490, and 5,814,464 each disclose the concept of anti-Tie-2 ligand antibodies and receptor bodies. U.S. Patent App. Pub. No. 2003/0124129A1 describes certain anti-Ang 2 antibodies and their use in treatment of cancer. Lin et al. (\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n95:8829-8834 [1998]) injected an adenovirus expressing soluble Tie-2 into mice; the soluble Tie-2 purportedly decreased the number and size of the tumors developed by the mice. In a related study, Lin et al. (\nJ. Clin. Invest., \n100:2072-2078 [1997]) injected a soluble form of Tie-2 into rats; this compound purportedly reduced tumor size in the rats. Siemeister et al. (\nCancer Res., \n59:3185-3189 [1999]) generated human melanoma cell lines expressing the extracellular domain of Tie-2, injected these cell lines into nude mice, and concluded that soluble Tie-2 purportedly resulted in a “significant inhibition” of tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis.\n\n\nHence, an effective anti-Ang-2 therapy might benefit a vast population of cancer patients because most solid tumors require neovascularization to grow beyond 1-2 millimeters in diameter. Such therapy might have wider application in other angiogenesis-associated diseases as well, such as retinopathies, arthritis, and psoriasis.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nAlthough much evidence points to the usefulness of inhibiting Ang2 levels in treatment of unwanted angiogenesis (or any subset of conditions involving unwanted generation of blood vessels, like arteriogenesis), the present state of the art does not make clear whether the simultaneous inhibition of Ang1 would be beneficial in such therapies and if so what degree of Ang1 inhibition, in addition to Ang2 inhibition, might prove to provide at least an additive therapeutic effect. Accordingly, the present invention addresses an unrecognized need to identify new agents that specifically recognize and bind both Ang-1 and Ang-2 ligands. The binding agents, such as the antibodies of the present invention, have the desired activity levels in inhibiting Ang2 as well as Ang1 that make them particularly useful in a variety of settings such as diagnostic screening, bioassays, and therapeutic intervention in diseases that are associated with Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 activity, such as cancer, inflammation, and other diseases related to undesired angiogenesis.\n\n\nThe various embodiments of the invention relate to targeted binding agents that specifically bind to Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 and therein inhibit physiological or pathological angiogenesis. Mechanisms by which this can be achieved can include, but are not limited to, either inhibition of binding of Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 to the Tie1 and/or Tie2 receptor, inhibition of Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 induced Tie1 and/or Tie2 signaling, or increased clearance of Ang1 and/or Ang-2 from a patient's body, therein reducing the effective concentration of Ang-1 and/or Ang-2.\n\n\nOne embodiment of the invention, the specific binding agent is a fully human antibody that specifically binds to Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 and prevents Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 binding to Tie1 and/or Tie2 receptors.

Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are typically performed according to the manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art using conventional procedures such as those set forth in Sambrook et al. (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. [1989]), or as described herein. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclature utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques may be used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.\n\n\nThe terms used to describe the present invention, unless specifically defined herein, shall have their meaning as understood and used in the art.\n\n\nIt should be noted that the terms H5 and H5P are used interchangeably and refer to the heavy chain used in various embodiments of the invention, e.g., mAbs named as H5L7, H5L6, H5L8, H5L4, H5L11, H5L1, H5L12, and H5L9.\n\n\nThe term “Ang-2” refers to the polypeptide set forth in FIG. 6 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,166,185 (“Tie-2 ligand-2”), incorporated herein by reference, or fragments thereof as well as related polypeptides which include allelic variants, splice variants, derivatives, substitution, deletions, and/or insertion variants, fusion peptides and polypeptides, and interspecies homologs. The Ang-2 polypeptide may or may not include additional terminal residues, e.g., leader sequences, targeting sequences, amino terminal methionine, amino terminal methionine and lysine residues, and/or tag or fusion proteins sequences, depending on the manner in which it is prepared.\n\n\nThe term “specific binding agent” refers to a molecule, preferably a proteinaceous molecule, that binds Ang-2 as well as Ang-1 (and variants and derivatives thereof as defined herein) with a greater affinity than other angiopoietins. A specific binding agent may be a protein, peptide, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, lipid, or small molecular weight compound which binds preferentially to Ang-2 and Ang-1. In a preferred embodiment, the specific binding agent according to the present invention is an antibody, such as a polyclonal antibody, a monoclonal antibody (mAb), a chimeric antibody, a CDR-grafted antibody, a multi-specific antibody, a bi-specific antibody, a catalytic antibody, a humanized antibody, a human antibody, an anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibody, and antibodies that can be labeled in soluble or bound form, as well as antigen-binding fragments, variants or derivatives thereof, either alone or in combination with other amino acid sequences, provided by known techniques. Such techniques include, but are not limited to enzymatic cleavage, chemical cleavage, peptide synthesis or recombinant techniques. The anti-Ang-2 and Ang-1 specific binding agents of the present invention are capable of binding portions of Ang-2 and Ang-1 that modulate, e.g., inhibit or promote, the biological activity of Ang-2 and Ang-1 and/or other Ang-2-and Ang-1-associated activities.\n\n\nThe term “polyclonal antibody” refers to a heterogeneous mixture of antibodies that recognize and bind to different epitopes on the same antigen. Polyclonal antibodies may be obtained from crude serum preparations or may be purified using, for example, antigen affinity chromatography, or Protein A/Protein G affinity chromatography.\n\n\nThe term “monoclonal antibodies” refers to a collection of antibodies encoded by the same nucleic acid molecule that are optionally produced by a single hybridoma (or clone thereof) or other cell line, or by a transgenic mammal such that each monoclonal antibody will typically recognize the same epitope on the antigen. The term “monoclonal” is not limited to any particular method for making the antibody, nor is the term limited to antibodies produced in a particular species, e.g., mouse, rat, etc.\n\n\nThe term “chimeric antibodies” refers to antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in an antibody derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is/are identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. Also included are antigen-binding fragments of such antibodies that exhibit the desired biological activity (i.e., the ability to specifically bind Ang-2). See, U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 and Morrison et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci \n(\nUSA\n), 81:6851-6855 [1985].\n\n\nThe term “CDR grafted antibody” refers to an antibody in which the CDR from one antibody of a particular species or isotype is recombinantly inserted into the framework of another antibody of the same or different species or isotype.\n\n\nThe term “multi-specific antibody” refers to an antibody having variable regions that recognize more than one epitope on one or more antigens. A subclass of this type of antibody is a “bi-specific antibody” which recognizes two distinct epitopes on the same or different antigens.\n\n\n“Catalytic” antibodies refers to antibodies wherein one or more cytotoxic, or more generally one or more biologically active, moieties are attached to the targeting binding agent.\n\n\nThe term “humanized antibody” refers to a specific type of CDR-grafted antibody in which the antibody framework region is derived from a human but each CDR is replaced with that derived from another species, such as a murine CDR. The term “CDR” is defined infra.\n\n\nThe term “fully human” antibody refers to an antibody in which both the CDR and the framework are derived from one or more human DNA molecules.\n\n\nThe term “anti-idiotype” antibody refers to any antibody that specifically binds to another antibody that recognizes an antigen. Production of anti-idiotype antibodies can be performed by any of the methods described herein for production of Ang-2-specific antibodies except that these antibodies arise from e.g., immunization of an animal with an Ang-2-specific antibody or Ang-2-binding fragment thereof, rather than Ang-2 polypeptide itself or a fragment thereof.\n\n\nThe term “variants,” as used herein, include those polypeptides wherein amino acid residues are inserted into, deleted from and/or substituted into the naturally occurring (or at least a known) amino acid sequence for the binding agent. Variants of the invention include fusion proteins as described below.\n\n\n“Derivatives” include those binding agents that have been chemically modified in some manner distinct from insertion, deletion, or substitution variants.\n\n\n“Specifically binds” refers to the ability of a specific binding agent (such as an antibody or fragment thereof) of the present invention to recognize and bind mature, full-length or partial-length target polypeptide (herein Ang-2 and Ang-1), or an ortholog thereof, such that its affinity (as determined by, e.g., Affinity ELISA or BIAcore assays as described herein) or its neutralization capability (as determined by e.g., Neutralization ELISA assays described herein, or similar assays) is at least 10 times as great, but optionally 50 times as great, 100, 250 or 500 times as great, or even at least 1000 times as great as the affinity or neutralization capability of the same for any other angiopoietin or other peptide or polypeptide.\n\n\nThe term “antigen binding domain” or “antigen binding region” refers to that portion of the specific binding agent (such as an antibody molecule) which contains the specific binding agent amino acid residues (or other moieties) that interact with an antigen and confer on the binding agent its specificity and affinity for the antigen. In an antibody, the antigen-binding domain is commonly referred to as the “complementarity-determining region, or CDR.”\n\n\nThe term “epitope” refers to that portion of any molecule capable of being recognized by and bound by a specific binding agent, e.g. an antibody, at one or more of the binding agent's antigen binding regions. Epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules, such as for example, amino acids or carbohydrate side chains, and have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics as well as specific charge characteristics. Epitopes as used herein may be contiguous or non-contiguous. Moreover, epitopes may be mimetic in that they comprise a three dimensional structure that is identical to the epitope used to generate the antibody, yet comprise none or only some of the amino acid residues found in the Ang-2 used to stimulate the antibody immune response.\n\n\nThe term “inhibiting and/or neutralizing epitope” is an epitope, which when bound by a specific binding agent such as an antibody, results in the loss of (or at least the decrease in) biological activity of the molecule, cell, or organism containing such epitope, in vivo, in vitro, or in situ. In the context of the present invention, the neutralizing epitope is located on or is associated with a biologically active region of Ang-2. Alternatively, the term “activating epitope” is an epitope, which when bound by a specific binding agent of the invention, such as an antibody, results in activation, or at least maintenance of a biologically active conformation, of Ang-2.\n\n\nThe term “antibody fragment” refers to a peptide or polypeptide which comprises less than a complete, intact antibody. Complete antibodies comprise two functionally independent parts or fragments: an antigen binding fragment known as “Fab,” and a carboxy terminal crystallizable fragment known as the “Fc” fragment. The Fab fragment includes the first constant domain from both the heavy and light chain (CH1 and CL1) together with the variable regions from both the heavy and light chains that bind the specific antigen. Each of the heavy and light chain variable regions includes three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework amino acid residues which separate the individual CDRs. The Fc region comprises the second and third heavy chain constant regions (CH2 and CH3) and is involved in effector functions such as complement activation and attack by phagocytic cells. In some antibodies, the Fc and Fab regions are separated by an antibody “hinge region,” and depending on how the full length antibody is proteolytically cleaved, the hinge region may be associated with either the Fab or Fc fragment. For example, cleavage of an antibody with the protease papain results in the hinge region being associated with the resulting Fc fragment, while cleavage with the protease pepsin provides a fragment wherein the hinge is associated with both Fab fragment simultaneously. Because the two Fab fragments are in fact covalently linked following pepsin cleavage, the resulting fragment is termed the F(ab′)2 fragment.\n\n\nAn Fc domain may have a relatively long serum half-life, whereas a Fab is short-lived. [Capon et al., Nature, 337: 525-31 (1989)] When expressed as part of a fusion protein, an Fc domain can impart longer half-life or incorporate such functions as Fc receptor binding, Protein A binding, complement fixation and perhaps even placental transfer into the protein to which it is fused. The Fc region may be a naturally occurring Fc region, or may be altered to improve certain qualities, such as therapeutic qualities or circulation time.\n\n\nThe term “variable region” or “variable domain” refers to a portion of the light and/or heavy chains of an antibody, typically including approximately the amino-\nterminal\n 120 to 130 amino acids in the heavy chain and about 100 to 110 amino terminal amino acids in the light chain. The variable regions typically differ extensively in amino acid sequence even among antibodies of the same species. The variable region of an antibody typically determines the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. The variability in sequence is concentrated in those regions referred to as complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), while the more highly conserved regions in the variable domain are called framework regions (FR). The CDRs of the light and heavy chains contain within them the amino acids which are largely responsible for the direct interaction of the antibody with antigen, however, amino acids in the FRs can significantly affect antigen binding/recognition as discussed herein infra.\n\n\nThe term “light chain” when used in reference to an antibody collectively refers to two distinct types, called kappa (k) or lambda (l) based on the amino acid sequence of the constant domains.\n\n\nThe term “heavy chain” when used in reference to an antibody collectively refers to five distinct types, called alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma and mu, based on the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain constant domain. The combination of heavy and light chains give rise to five known classes of antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, respectively, including four known subclasses of IgG, designated as IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3 \nand IgG\n4\n.\n\n\nThe term “naturally occurring” when used in connection with biological materials such as nucleic acid molecules, polypeptides, host cells, and the like, refers to those which are found in nature and not modified by a human being.\n\n\nThe term “isolated” when used in relation to Ang-2 or to a specific binding agent of Ang-2 refers to a compound that is free from at least one contaminating polypeptide or compound that is found in its natural environment, and preferably substantially free from any other contaminating mammalian polypeptides that would interfere with its therapeutic or diagnostic use.\n\n\nThe term “mature” when used in relation to Ang-2, anti-Ang-2 antibody, or to any other proteinaceous specific binding agent of Ang-2 refers to a peptide or a polypeptide lacking a leader or signal sequence. When a binding agent of the invention is expressed, for example, in a prokaryotic host cell, the “mature” peptide or polypeptide may also include additional amino acid residues (but still lack a leader sequence) such as an amino terminal methionine, or one or more methionine and lysine residues. A peptide or polypeptide produced in this manner may be utilized with or without these additional amino acid residues having been removed.\n\n\nSpecific Binding Agents and Antibodies\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “specific binding agent” refers to a molecule that has specificity for recognizing and binding Ang-2 and Ang-1, as described herein. Suitable specific binding agents include, but are not limited to, antibodies and derivatives thereof, polypeptides, and small molecules. Suitable specific binding agents may be prepared using methods known in the art. An exemplary Ang-2 and Ang-1 polypeptide specific binding agent of the present invention is capable of binding a certain portion of the Ang-2 and Ang-1 polypeptides, and preferably modulating the activity or function of Ang-2 and Ang-1 polypeptides.\n\n\nSpecific binding agents such as antibodies and antibody fragments that specifically bind Ang-2 and Ang-1 polypeptides are within the scope of the present invention. The antibodies may be polyclonal including mono-specific polyclonal, monoclonal (mAbs), recombinant, chimeric, humanized such as CDR-grafted, human, single chain, catalytic, multi-specific and/or bi-specific, as well as antigen-binding fragments, variants, and/or derivatives thereof.\n\n\nPolyclonal antibodies against Ang2 and Ang1 polypeptides generally are produced in animals (e.g., rabbits, hamsters, goats, sheep, horses, pigs, rats, gerbils, guinea pigs, mice, or any other suitable mammal, as well as other non-mammal species) by means of multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections of Ang-2 and/or Ang-1 polypeptide or a fragment thereof with or without an adjuvant. Such adjuvants include, but are not limited to, Freund's complete and incomplete, mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, and surface-active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and dinitrophenol. BCG (bacilli Calmette-Guerin) and \nCorynebacterium parvum \nare potentially useful human adjuvants. It may be useful to conjugate an antigen polypeptide to a carrier protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum, albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor. Also, aggregating agents such as alum are used to enhance the immune response. After immunization, the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for anti-Ang-2 polypeptide antibody titer which can be determined using the assays described herein under “Examples”. Polyclonal antibodies may be utilized in the sera from which they were detected, or may be purified from the sera, using, for example, antigen affinity chromatography or Protein A or G affinity chromatography.\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies directed toward Ang-2 polypeptides can be produced using, for example but without limitation, the traditional “hybridoma” method or the newer “phage display” technique. For example, monoclonal antibodies of the invention may be made by the hybridoma method as described in Kohler et al., \nNature \n256:495 [1975]; the human B-cell hybridoma technique [Kosbor et al., \nImmunol Today \n4:72 (1983); Cote et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci \n(\nUSA\n) 80: 2026-2030 (1983); Brodeur et al., \nMonoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications\n, pp. 51-63, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987)] and the EBV-hybridoma technique [Cole et al., \nMonoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy\n, Alan R Liss Inc, New York N.Y., pp 77-96, (1985)]. Also provided by the invention are hybridoma cell lines that produce monoclonal antibodies reactive with Ang-2 polypeptides.\n\n\nWhen the hybridoma technique is employed, myeloma cell lines can be used. Such cell lines suited for use in hybridoma-producing fusion procedures preferably are non-antibody-producing, have high fusion efficiency, and enzyme deficiencies that render them incapable of growing in certain selective media which support the growth of only the desired fused cells (hybridomas). For example, cell lines used in mouse fusions are Sp-20, P3-X63/Ag8, P3-X63-Ag8.653, NS1/1.Ag 4 1, Sp210-Ag14, FO, NSO/U, MPC-11, MPC11-X45-GTG 1.7 and S194/5XX0Bul; cell lines used in rat fusions are R210.RCY3, Y3-Ag 1.2.3, IR983F and 4B210. Other cell lines useful for cell fusions are U-266, GM1500-GRG2, LICR-LON-HMy2 and UC729-6. Hybridomas and other cell lines that produce monoclonal antibodies are contemplated to be novel compositions of the present invention.\n\n\nThe phage display technique may also be used to generate monoclonal antibodies from any species. Preferably, this technique is used to produce fully human monoclonal antibodies in which a polynucleotide encoding a single Fab or Fv antibody fragment is expressed on the surface of a phage particle. [Hoogenboom et al., \nJ Mol Biol \n227: 381 (1991); Marks et al., \nJ Mol Biol \n222: 581 (1991); see also U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,793)]. Each phage can be “screened” using binding assays described herein to identify those antibody fragments having affinity for Ang-2. Thus, these processes mimic immune selection through the display of antibody fragment repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, and subsequent selection of phage by their binding to Ang-2. One such procedure is described in PCT Application No. PCT/US98/17364, filed in the name of Adams et al., which describes the isolation of high affinity and functional agonistic antibody fragments for MPL- and msk-receptors using such an approach. In this approach, a complete repertoire of human antibody genes can be created by cloning naturally rearranged human V genes from peripheral blood lymphocytes as previously described [Mullinax et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci \n(\nUSA\n) 87: 8095-8099 (1990)].\n\n\nOnce a polynucleotide sequences are identified which encode each chain of the full length monoclonal antibody or the Fab or Fv fragment(s) of the invention, host cells, either eukaryotic or prokaryotic, may be used to express the monoclonal antibody polynucleotides using recombinant techniques well known and routinely practiced in the art. Alternatively, transgenic animals are produced wherein a polynucleotide encoding the desired specific binding agent is introduced into the genome of a recipient animal, such as, for example, a mouse, rabbit, goat, or cow, in a manner that permits expression of the polynucleotide molecules encoding a monoclonal antibody or other specific binding agent. In one aspect, the polynucleotides encoding the monoclonal antibody or other specific binding agent can be ligated to mammary-specific regulatory sequences, and the chimeric polynucleotides can be introduced into the germline of the target animal. The resulting transgenic animal then produces the desired antibody in its milk [Pollock et al., \nJ Immunol Meth \n231:147-157 (1999); Little et al., \nImmunol Today \n8:364-370 (2000)]. In addition, plants may be used to express and produce Ang-2 specific binding agents such as monoclonal antibodies by transfecting suitable plants with the polynucleotides encoding the monoclonal antibodies or other specific binding agents.\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the present invention, a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody or fragment thereof that is derived from other than a human species may be “humanized” or “chimerized”. Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,859,205, 5,585,089, and 5,693,762). Humanization is performed, for example, using methods described in the art [Jones et al., \nNature \n321: 522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., \nNature, \n332: 323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., \nScience \n239:1534-1536 (1988)] by substituting at least a portion of, for example a rodent, complementarity-determining region (CDRs) for the corresponding regions of a human antibody. The invention also provides variants and derivatives of these human antibodies as discussed herein and well known in the art.\n\n\nAlso encompassed by the invention are fully human antibodies that bind Ang-2 polypeptides, as well as, antigen-binding fragments, variants and/or derivatives thereof. Such antibodies can be produced using the phage display technique described above. Alternatively, transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production can be used to generate such antibodies. This can be accomplished by immunization of the animal with an Ang-2 antigen or fragments thereof where the Ang-2 fragments have an amino acid sequence that is unique to Ang-2. Such immunogens can be optionally conjugated to a carrier. See, for example, Jakobovits et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci \n(\nUSA\n), 90: 2551-2555 (1993); Jakobovits et al., \nNature \n362: 255-258 (1993); Bruggermann et al., \nYear in Immuno, \n7: 33 (1993). In one method, such transgenic animals are produced by incapacitating the endogenous loci encoding the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains therein, and inserting loci encoding human heavy and light chain proteins into the genome thereof. Partially modified animals, that are those having less than the full complement of these modifications, are then crossbred to obtain an animal having all of the desired immune system modifications. When administered an immunogen, these transgenic animals are capable of producing antibodies with human variable regions, including human (rather than e.g., murine) amino acid sequences, that are immuno-specific for the desired antigens. See PCT application Nos., PCT/US96/05928 and PCT/US93/06926. Additional methods are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,807, PCT application Nos. PCT/US91/245, PCT/GB89/01207, and in EP 546073B1 and EP 546073A1. Human antibodies may also be produced by the expression of recombinant DNA in host cells or by expression in hybridoma cells as described herein.\n\n\nTransgenesis is achieved in a number of different ways. See, for example, Bruggeman et al., \nImmunol Today \n17:391-7 (1996). In one approach, a minilocus is constructed such that gene segments in a germline configuration are brought artificially close to each other. Due to size limitations (i.e., having generally less than 30 kb), the resulting minilocus will contain a limited number of differing gene segments, but is still capable of producing a large repertoire of antibodies. Miniloci containing only human DNA sequences, including promoters and enhancers are fully functional in the transgenic mouse.\n\n\nWhen larger number of gene segments are desired in the transgenic animal, yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) are utilized. YACs can range from several hundred kilobases to 1 Mb and are introduced into the mouse (or other appropriate animal) genome via microinjection directly into an egg or via transfer of the YAC into embryonic stem (ES)-cell lines. In general, YACs are transferred into ES cells by lipofection of the purified DNA, or yeast spheroplast fusion wherein the purified DNA is carried in micelles and fusion is carried out in manner similar to hybridoma fusion protocols. Selection of desired ES cells following DNA transfer is accomplished by including on the YAC any of the selectable markers known in the art.\n\n\nAs another alternative, bacteriophage P1 vectors are used which are amplified in a bacterial \nE. coli \nhost. While these vectors generally carry less inserted DNA than a YAC, the clones are readily grown in high enough yield to permit direct microinjection into a mouse egg. Use of a cocktail of different P1 vectors has been shown to lead to high levels of homologous recombination.\n\n\nOnce an appropriate transgenic mouse (or other appropriate animal) has been identified, using any of the techniques known in the art to detect serum levels of a circulating antibody (e.g., ELISA), the transgenic animal is crossed with a mouse in which the endogenous Ig locus has been disrupted. The result provides progeny wherein essentially all B cells express human antibodies.\n\n\nAs still another alternative, the entire animal Ig locus is replaced with the human Ig locus, wherein the resulting animal expresses only human antibodies. In another approach, portions of the animal's locus are replaced with specific and corresponding regions in the human locus. In certain cases, the animals resulting from this procedure may express chimeric antibodies, as opposed to fully human antibodies, depending on the nature of the replacement in the mouse Ig locus.\n\n\nHuman antibodies can also be produced by exposing human splenocytes (B or T cells) to an antigen in vitro, then reconstituting the exposed cells in an immunocompromised mouse, e.g. SCID or nod/SCID. See Brams et al., \nJ Immunol, \n160: 2051-2058 [1998]; Carballido et al., \nNat Med, \n6: 103-106 [2000]. In one approach, engraftment of human fetal tissue into SCID mice (SCID-hu) results in long-term hematopoiesis and human T-cell development [McCune et al., \nScience \n241:1532-1639 (1988); Ifversen et al., \nSem Immunol \n8:243-248 (1996)]. Any humoral immune response in these chimeric mice is completely dependent on co-development of T-cells in the animals [Martensson et al., \nImmunol \n83:1271-179 (1994)]. In an alternative approach, human peripheral blood lymphocytes are transplanted intraperitoneally (or otherwise) into SCID mice [Mosier et al., \nNature \n335:256-259 (1988)]. When the transplanted cells are treated with either a priming agent, such as Staphylococcal Enterotoxin A (SEA) [Martensson et al., \nImmunol \n84: 224-230 (1995)], or anti-human CD40 monoclonal antibodies [Murphy et al., \nBlood \n86:1946-1953 (1995)], higher levels of B cell production are detected.\n\n\nAlternatively, an entirely synthetic human heavy chain repertoire is created from unrearranged V gene segments by assembling each human VH segment with D segments of random nucleotides together with a human J segment [Hoogenboom et al., \nJ Mol Biol \n227:381-388 (1992)]. Likewise, a light chain repertoire is constructed by combining each human V segment with a J segment [Griffiths et al., \nEMBO J. \n13:3245-3260 (1994)]. Nucleotides encoding the complete antibody (i.e., both heavy and light chains) are linked as a single chain Fv fragment and this polynucleotide is ligated to a nucleotide encoding a filamentous phage minor coat protein. When this fusion protein is expressed on the surface of the phage, a polynucleotide encoding a specific antibody is identified by selection using an immobilized antigen.\n\n\nIn still another approach, antibody fragments are assembled as two Fab fragments by fusion of one chain to a phage protein and secretion of the other into bacterial periplasm [Hoogenboom et al., \nNucl Acids Res \n19:4133-4137 [1991]; Barbas et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci \n(\nUSA\n) 88:7978-7982 (1991)].\n\n\nLarge-scale production of chimeric, humanized, CDR-grafted, and fully human antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, are typically produced by recombinant methods. Polynucleotide molecule(s) encoding the heavy and light chains of each antibody or antigen-binding fragments thereof, can be introduced into host cells and expressed using materials and procedures described herein. In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies are produced in mammalian host cells, such as CHO cells. Details of such production are described herein.\n\n\nThe specific binding agents of the present invention, such as the antibodies, antibody fragments, and antibody derivatives of the invention can further comprise any constant region known in the art. The light chain constant region can be, for example, a kappa- or lambda-type light chain constant region, e.g., a human kappa- or lambda-type light chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region can be, for example, an alpha-, delta-, epsilon-, gamma-, or mu-type heavy chain constant regions, e.g., a human alpha-, delta-, epsilon-, gamma-, or mu-type heavy chain constant region. In one embodiment, the light or heavy chain constant region is a fragment, derivative, variant, or mutein of a naturally occurring constant region.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the specific binding agents of the present invention, such as the antibodies, antibody fragments, and antibody derivatives of the invention comprise an IgG.\n\n\nTechniques are known for deriving an antibody of a different subclass or isotype from an antibody of interest, i.e., subclass switching. Thus, IgG antibodies may be derived from an IgM antibody, for example, and vice versa. Such techniques allow the preparation of new antibodies that possess the antigen-binding properties of a given antibody (the parent antibody), but also exhibit biological properties associated with an antibody isotype or subclass different from that of the parent antibody. Recombinant DNA techniques may be employed. Cloned DNA encoding particular antibody polypeptides may be employed in such procedures, e.g., DNA encoding the constant domain of an antibody of the desired isotype. See also Lantto et al., 2002, Methods Mol. Biol. 178:303-16.\n\n\nThe specific binding agents of the present invention, such as the antibodies, antibody fragments, and antibody derivatives of the invention may comprise the IgG1 heavy chain constant domain or a fragment of the IgG1 heavy chain domain.

\n\nFusion Partners of Specific Binding Agents\n\n\n\nIn a further embodiment of the invention, the polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence variable domains of Ang-2 antibodies, such as a heavy chain variable region with an amino acid sequence as described herein or a light chain variable region with an amino acid sequence as described herein, may be fused at either the N-terminus or the C-terminus to one or more domains of an Fc region of human IgG. When constructed together with a therapeutic protein such as the Fab of an Ang-2-specific antibody, an Fc domain can provide longer half-life or incorporate such functions as Fc receptor binding, Protein A binding, complement fixation and perhaps even placental transfer. [Capon et al., Nature, 337: 525-531 (1989)].\n\n\nIn one example, the antibody hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions may be fused at either the N-terminus or C-terminus of the specific binding agent polypeptides such as an anti-Ang-2 Fab or Fv fragment (obtained, e.g., from a phage display library) using methods known to the skilled artisan. The resulting fusion protein may be purified by use of a Protein A or Protein G affinity column. Peptides and proteins fused to an Fc region have been found to exhibit a substantially greater half-life in vivo than the unfused counterpart. Also, a fusion to an Fc region allows for dimerization/multimerization of the fusion polypeptide. The Fc region may be a naturally occurring Fc region, or may be altered to improve certain qualities, such as therapeutic qualities, circulation time, decrease aggregation problems, etc. Other examples known in the art include those wherein the Fc region, which may be human or another species, or may be synthetic, is fused to the N-terminus of CD30L to treat Hodgkin's Disease, anaplastic lymphoma and T-cell leukemia (U.S. Pat. No. 5,480,981), the Fc region is fused to the TNF receptor to treat septic shock [Fisher et al., N Engl J Med, 334: 1697-1702 (1996)], and the Fc region is fused to the Cd4 receptor to treat AIDS [Capon et al., Nature, 337: 525-31 (1989)].\n\n\nCatalytic antibodies are another type of fusion molecule and include antibodies to which one or more cytotoxic, or more generally one or more biologically active, moieties are attached to the specific binding agent. See, for example Rader et al., \nChem Eur J \n12:2091-2095 (2000). Cytotoxic agents of this type improve antibody-mediated cytotoxicity, and include such moieties as cytokines that directly or indirectly stimulate cell death, radioisotopes, chemotherapeutic drugs (including prodrugs), bacterial toxins (ex. pseudomonas exotoxin, diphtheria toxin, etc.), plant toxins (ex. ricin, gelonin, etc.), chemical conjugates (e.g., maytansinoid toxins, calechaemicin, etc.), radioconjugates, enzyme conjugates (RNase conjugates, antibody-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy [ADEPT)]), and the like. In one aspect, the cytotoxic agent can be “attached” to one component of a bi-specific or multi-specific antibody by binding of this agent to one of the alternative antigen recognition sites on the antibody. As an alternative, protein cytotoxins can be expressed as fusion proteins with the specific binding agent following ligation of a polynucleotide encoding the toxin to a polynucleotide encoding the binding agent. In still another alternative, the specific binding agent can be covalently modified to include the desired cytotoxin.\n\n\nExamples of such fusion proteins are immunogenic polypeptides, proteins with long circulating half lives, such as immunoglobulin constant regions, marker proteins, proteins or polypeptides that facilitate purification of the desired specific binding agent polypeptide, and polypeptide sequences that promote formation of multimeric proteins (such as leucine zipper motifs that are useful in dimer formation/stability).\n\n\nThis type of insertional variant generally has all or a substantial portion of the native molecule, linked at the N- or C-terminus, to all or a portion of a second polypeptide. For example, fusion proteins typically employ leader sequences from other species to permit the recombinant expression of a protein in a heterologous host. Another useful fusion protein includes the addition of an immunologically active domain, such as an antibody epitope, to facilitate purification of the fusion protein. Inclusion of a cleavage site at or near the fusion junction will facilitate removal of the extraneous polypeptide after purification. Other useful fusions include linking of functional domains, such as active sites from enzymes, glycosylation domains, cellular targeting signals or transmembrane regions.\n\n\nThere are various commercially available fusion protein expression systems that may be used in the present invention. Particularly useful systems include but are not limited to the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) system (Pharmacia), the maltose binding protein system (NEB, Beverley, Mass.), the FLAG system (IBI, New Haven, Conn.), and the 6×His system (Qiagen, Chatsworth, Calif.). These systems are capable of producing recombinant polypeptides bearing only a small number of additional amino acids, which are unlikely to affect the antigenic ability of the recombinant polypeptide. For example, both the FLAG system and the 6×His system add only short sequences, both of which are known to be poorly antigenic and which do not adversely affect folding of the polypeptide to its native conformation. Another N-terminal fusion that is contemplated to be useful is the fusion of a Met-Lys dipeptide at the N-terminal region of the protein or peptides. Such a fusion may produce beneficial increases in protein expression or activity.\n\n\nA particularly useful fusion construct may be one in which a specific binding agent peptide is fused to a hapten to enhance immunogenicity of a specific binding agent fusion construct which is useful, for example, in the production of anti-idiotype antibodies of the invention. Such fusion constructs to increase immunogenicity are well known to those of skill in the art, for example, a fusion of specific binding agent with a helper antigen such as hsp70 or peptide sequences such as from diphtheria toxin chain or a cytokine such as IL-2 will be useful in eliciting an immune response. In other embodiments, fusion construct can be made which will enhance the targeting of the antigen binding agent compositions to a specific site or cell.\n\n\nOther fusion constructs including heterologous polypeptides with desired properties, e.g., an Ig constant region to prolong serum half-life or an antibody or fragment thereof for targeting also are contemplated. Other fusion systems produce polypeptide hybrids where it is desirable to excise the fusion partner from the desired polypeptide. In one embodiment, the fusion partner is linked to the recombinant specific binding agent polypeptide by a peptide sequence containing a specific recognition sequence for a protease. Examples of suitable sequences are those recognized by the Tobacco Etch Virus protease (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.) or Factor Xa (New England Biolabs, Beverley, Mass.).\n\n\nThe invention also provides fusion polypeptides comprising all or part of a variable domain of an Ang-2 antibody, such as a heavy chain variable region with an amino acid sequence as described herein or a light chain variable region with an amino acid sequence as described herein in combination with truncated tissue factor (tTF), a vascular targeting agent consisting of a truncated form of a human coagulation-inducing protein that acts as a tumor blood vessel clotting agent. The fusion of tTF to the anti-Ang-2 antibody, or fragments thereof may facilitate the delivery of anti-Ang-2 to target cells.\n\n\nVariants of Specific Binding Agents\n\n\nVariants of Specific Binding Agents of the present invention include insertion, deletion, and/or substitution variants. In one aspect of the invention, insertion variants are provided wherein one or more amino acid residues supplement a specific binding agent amino acid sequence. Insertions may be located at either or both termini of the protein, or may be positioned within internal regions of the specific binding agent amino acid sequence. Insertional variants with additional residues at either or both termini can include, for example, fusion proteins and proteins including amino acid tags or labels. Insertion variants include specific binding agent polypeptides wherein one or more amino acid residues are added to a specific binding agent amino acid sequence, or fragment thereof.\n\n\nVariant products of the invention also include mature specific binding agent products. Such specific binding agent products have the leader or signal sequences removed, however the resulting protein has additional amino terminal residues as compared to wild-type Ang-2 polypeptide. The additional amino terminal residues may be derived from another protein, or may include one or more residues that are not identifiable as being derived from a specific protein. Specific binding agent products with an additional methionine residue at position −1 (Met\n−1\n-specific binding agent) are contemplated, as are specific binding agent products with additional methionine and lysine residues at positions −2 and −1 (Met\n−2\n-Lys\n−1\n-specific binding agent). Variants of specific binding agents having additional Met, Met-Lys, Lys residues (or one or more basic residues in general) are particularly useful for enhanced recombinant protein production in bacterial host cells.\n\n\nThe invention also embraces specific binding agent variants having additional amino acid residues that arise from use of specific expression systems. For example, use of commercially available vectors that express a desired polypeptide as part of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion product provides the desired polypeptide having an additional glycine residue at amino acid position −1 after cleavage of the GST component from the desired polypeptide. Variants which result from expression in other vector systems are also contemplated, including those wherein poly-histidine tags are incorporated into the amino acid sequence, generally at the carboxy and/or amino terminus of the sequence.\n\n\nInsertional variants also include fusion proteins as described above, wherein the amino and/or carboxy termini of the specific binding agent-polypeptide is fused to another polypeptide, a fragment thereof, or amino acid sequences which are not generally recognized to be part of any specific protein sequence.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides deletion variants wherein one or more amino acid residues in a specific binding agent polypeptide are removed. Deletions can be effected at one or both termini of the specific binding agent polypeptide, or from removal of one or more residues within the specific binding agent amino acid sequence. Deletion variants necessarily include all fragments of a specific binding agent polypeptide.\n\n\nAntibody fragments include those portions of the antibody that bind to an epitope on the antigen polypeptide. Examples of such fragments include Fab and F(ab′)\n2 \nfragments generated, for example, by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of full-length antibodies. Other binding fragments include those generated by recombinant DNA techniques, such as the expression of recombinant plasmids containing nucleic acid sequences encoding antibody variable regions. The invention also embraces polypeptide fragments of an Ang-2 binding agent wherein the fragments maintain the ability to specifically bind an Ang-2 polypeptide. Fragments comprising at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 or 50 or more consecutive amino acids of a peptide or polypeptide of the invention are comprehended herein. Preferred polypeptide fragments display immunological properties unique to or specific for the antigen-binding agent so of the invention. Fragments of the invention having the desired immunological properties can be prepared by any of the methods well known and routinely practiced in the art.\n\n\nIn still another aspect, the invention provides substitution variants of specific binding agents of the invention. Substitution variants are generally considered to be “similar” to the original polypeptide or to have a certain “percent identity” to the original polypeptide, and include those polypeptides wherein one or more amino acid residues of a polypeptide are removed and replaced with alternative residues. In one aspect, the substitutions are conservative in nature, however, the invention embraces substitutions that are also non-conservative.\n\n\nIdentity and similarity of related polypeptides can be readily calculated by known methods. Such methods include, but are not limited to, those described in Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A. M., ed., Oxford University Press, New York (1988); Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New York (1993); Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, \nPart\n 1, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey (1994); Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press (1987); Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M. Stockton Press, New York (1991); and Carillo et al., \nSIAM J. Applied Math., \n48:1073 (1988).\n\n\nPreferred methods to determine the relatedness or percent identity of two polypeptides are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Methods to determine identity are described in publicly available computer programs. Preferred computer program methods to determine identity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, the GCG program package, including GAP (Devereux et al., \nNucl. Acid. Res., \n12:387 (1984); Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis., BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA (Altschul et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n215:403-410 (1990)). The BLASTX program is publicly available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and other sources (\nBLAST Manual\n, Altschul et al. NCB/NLM/NIH Bethesda, Md. 20894; Altschul et al., supra (1990)). The well-known Smith Waterman algorithm may also be used to determine identity.\n\n\nCertain alignment schemes for aligning two amino acid sequences may result in the matching of only a short region of the two sequences, and this small aligned region may have very high sequence identity even though there is no significant relationship between the two full-length sequences. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the selected alignment method (GAP program) will result in an alignment that spans at least ten percent of the full length of the target polypeptide being compared, i.e., at least 40 contiguous amino acids where sequences of at least 400 amino acids are being compared, 30 contiguous amino acids where sequences of at least 300 to about 400 amino acids are being compared, at least 20 contiguous amino acids where sequences of 200 to about 300 amino acids are being compared, and at least 10 contiguous amino acids where sequences of about 100 to 200 amino acids are being compared.\n\n\nFor example, using the computer algorithm GAP (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wis.), two polypeptides for which the percent sequence identity is to be determined are aligned for optimal matching of their respective amino acids (the “matched span”, as determined by the algorithm). In certain embodiments, a gap opening penalty (which is typically calculated as 3× the average diagonal; the “average diagonal” is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the “diagonal” is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the particular comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty (which is usually 1/10 times the gap opening penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such as \nPAM\n 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm. In certain embodiments, a standard comparison matrix (see Dayhoff et al., \nAtlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, \n5(3)(1978) for the \nPAM\n 250 comparison matrix; Henikoff et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n89:10915-10919 (1992) for the BLOSUM 62 comparison matrix) is also used by the algorithm.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the parameters for a polypeptide sequence comparison include the following:\n\n\nAlgorithm: Needleman et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n48:443-453 (1970);\n\n\nComparison matrix: BLOSUM 62 from Henikoff et al., supra (1992);\n\n\nGap Penalty: 12\n\n\nGap Length Penalty: 4\n\n\nThreshold of Similarity: 0\n\n\nThe GAP program may be useful with the above parameters. In certain embodiments, the aforementioned parameters are the default parameters for polypeptide comparisons (along with no penalty for end gaps) using the GAP algorithm.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the parameters for polynucleotide molecule sequence comparisons include the following:\n\n \n \n \n \nAlgorithm: Needleman et al., supra (1970);\n \nComparison matrix: matches=+10, mismatch=0\n \nGap Penalty: 50\n \nGap Length Penalty: 3\n \n \n \n\n\nThe GAP program may also be useful with the above parameters. The aforementioned parameters are the default parameters for polynucleotide molecule comparisons.\n\n\nOther exemplary algorithms, gap opening penalties, gap extension penalties, comparison matrices, thresholds of similarity, etc. may be used, including those set forth in the Program Manual, Wisconsin Package, \nVersion\n 9, September, 1997. The particular choices to be made will be apparent to those of skill in the art and will depend on the specific comparison to be made, such as DNA-to-DNA, protein-to-protein, protein-to-DNA; and additionally, whether the comparison is between given pairs of sequences (in which case GAP or BestFit are generally preferred) or between one sequence and a large database of sequences (in which case FASTA or BLASTA are preferred).\n\n\nAs used herein, the twenty conventional amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage. See Immunology—A Synthesis (2nd Edition, E. S. Golub and D. R. Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Mass. (1991)), which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose.\n\n\nThe amino acids may have either L or D stereochemistry (except for Gly, which is neither L nor D) and the polypeptides and compositions of the present invention may comprise a combination of stereochemistries. However, the L stereochemistry is preferred. The invention also provides reverse molecules wherein the amino terminal to carboxy terminal sequence of the amino acids is reversed. For example, the reverse of a molecule having the normal sequence X\n1\n-X\n2\n-X\n3 \nwould be X\n3\n-X\n2\n-X\n1\n. The invention also provides retro-reverse molecules wherein, as above, the amino terminal to carboxy terminal sequence of amino acids is reversed and residues that are normally “L” enantiomers are altered to the “D” stereoisomer form.\n\n\nStereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as α-, α-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino acids may also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present invention. Examples of unconventional amino acids include, without limitation: aminoadipic acid, beta-alanine, beta-aminopropionic acid, aminobutyric acid, piperidinic acid, aminocaprioic acid, aminoheptanoic acid, aminoisobutyric acid, aminopimelic acid, diaminobutyric acid, desmosine, diaminopimelic acid, diaminopropionic acid, N-ethylglycine, N-ethylaspargine, hyroxylysine, allo-hydroxylysine, hydroxyproline, isodesmosine, allo-isoleucine, N-methylglycine, sarcosine, N-methylisoleucine, N-methylvaline, norvaline, norleucine, orithine, 4-hydroxyproline, γ-carboxyglutamate, ε-N,N,N-trimethyllysine, ε-N-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, σ-N-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and amino acids (e.g., 4-hydroxyproline).\n\n\nSimilarly, unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5′ end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5′ direction. The direction of 5′ to 3′ addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5′ to the 5′ end of the RNA transcript are referred to as “upstream sequences”; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3′ to the 3′ end of the RNA transcript are referred to as “downstream sequences”.\n\n\nConservative amino acid substitutions may encompass non-naturally occurring amino acid residues, which are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems. These include peptidomimetics and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties.\n\n\nNaturally occurring residues may be divided into classes based on common side chain properties:\n\n\n1) hydrophobic: Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile;\n\n\n2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln;\n\n\n3) acidic: Asp, Glu;\n\n\n4) basic: His, Lys, Arg;\n\n\n5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and\n\n\n6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.\n\n\nFor example, non-conservative substitutions may involve the exchange of a member of one of these classes for a member from another class. Such substituted residues may be introduced into regions of the human antibody that are homologous with non-human antibodies, or into the non-homologous regions of the molecule.\n\n\nIn making such changes, according to certain embodiments, the hydropathic index of amino acids may be considered. Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics. They are: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9); alanine (+1.8); glycine (−0.4); threonine (−0.7); serine (−0.8); tryptophan (−0.9); tyrosine (−1.3); proline (−1.6); histidine (−3.2); glutamate (−3.5); glutamine (−3.5); aspartate (−3.5); asparagine (−3.5); lysine (−3.9); and arginine (−4.5).\n\n\nThe importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biological function on a protein is understood in the art. Kyte et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n157:105-131 (1982). It is known that certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and still retain a similar biological activity. In making changes based upon the hydropathic index, in certain embodiments, the substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within ±2 is included. In certain embodiments, those which are within ±1 are included, and in certain embodiments, those within ±0.5 are included.\n\n\nIt is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity, particularly where the biologically functional protein or peptide thereby created is intended for use in immunological embodiments, as in the present case. In certain embodiments, the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with its immunogenicity and antigenicity, i.e., with a biological property of the protein.\n\n\nThe following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to these amino acid residues: arginine (+3.0); lysine (+3.0); aspartate (+3.0±1); glutamate (+3.0±1); serine (+0.3); asparagine (+0.2); glutamine (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (−0.4); proline (−0.5±1); alanine (−0.5); histidine (−0.5); cysteine (−1.0); methionine (−1.3); valine (−1.5); leucine (−1.8); isoleucine (−1.8); tyrosine (−2.3); phenylalanine (−2.5) and tryptophan (−3.4). In making changes based upon similar hydrophilicity values, in certain embodiments, the substitution of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within ±2 is included, in certain embodiments, those which are within ±1 are included, and in certain embodiments, those within ±0.5 are included. One may also identify epitopes from primary amino acid sequences on the basis of hydrophilicity. These regions are also referred to as “epitopic core regions.”\n\n\nExemplary amino acid substitutions are set forth in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmino Acid Substitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOriginal\n\n\n \n\n\nPreferred\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResidues\n\n\nExemplary Substitutions\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla\n\n\nVal, Leu, Ile\n\n\nVal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg\n\n\nLys, Gln, Asn\n\n\nLys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn\n\n\nGln, Glu, Asp\n\n\nGln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp\n\n\nGlu, Gln, Asn\n\n\nGlu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys\n\n\nSer, Ala\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln\n\n\nAsn, Glu, Asp\n\n\nAsn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlu\n\n\nAsp, Asn, Gln\n\n\nAsp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly\n\n\nPro, Ala\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis\n\n\nAsn, Gln, Lys, Arg\n\n\nArg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle\n\n\nLeu, Val, Met, Ala,\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPhe, Norleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu\n\n\nNorleucine, Ile,\n\n\nIle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nVal, Met, Ala, Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys\n\n\nArg, 1,4Diamino-butyric Acid,\n\n\nArg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGln, Asn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet\n\n\nLeu, Phe, Ile\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe\n\n\nLeu, Val, Ile, Ala,\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro\n\n\nAla\n\n\nGly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer\n\n\nThr, Ala, Cys\n\n\nThr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr\n\n\nSer\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp\n\n\nTyr, Phe\n\n\nTyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr\n\n\nTrp, Phe, Thr, Ser\n\n\nPhe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal\n\n\nIle, Met, Leu, Phe,\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAla, Norleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA skilled artisan will be able to determine suitable variants of the polypeptide as set forth herein using well-known techniques. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art may identify suitable areas of the molecule that may be changed without destroying activity by targeting regions not believed to be important for activity. In certain embodiments, one can identify residues and portions of the molecules that are conserved among similar polypeptides. In certain embodiments, even areas that may be important for biological activity or for structure may be subject to conservative amino acid substitutions without destroying the biological activity or without adversely affecting the polypeptide structure.\n\n\nAdditionally, one skilled in the art can review structure-function studies identifying residues in similar polypeptides that are important for activity or structure. In view of such a comparison, one can predict the importance of amino acid residues in a protein that correspond to amino acid residues which are important for activity or structure in similar proteins. One skilled in the art may opt for chemically similar amino acid substitutions for such predicted important amino acid residues.\n\n\nOne skilled in the art can also analyze the three-dimensional structure and amino acid sequence in relation to that structure in similar polypeptides. In view of such information, one skilled in the art may predict the alignment of amino acid residues of an antibody with respect to its three dimensional structure. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art may choose not to make radical changes to amino acid residues predicted to be on the surface of the protein, since such residues may be involved in important interactions with other molecules. Moreover, one skilled in the art may generate test variants containing a single amino acid substitution at each desired amino acid residue. The variants can then be screened using activity assays known to those skilled in the art. Such variants could be used to gather information about suitable variants. For example, if one discovered that a change to a particular amino acid residue resulted in destroyed, undesirably reduced, or unsuitable activity, variants with such a change may be avoided. In other words, based on information gathered from such routine experiments, one skilled in the art can readily determine the amino acids where further substitutions should be avoided either alone or in combination with other mutations.\n\n\nA number of scientific publications have been devoted to the prediction of secondary structure. See Moult J., \nCurr. Op. in Biotech., \n7(4):422-427 (1996), Chou et al., \nBiochemistry, \n13(2):222-245 (1974); Chou et al., \nBiochemistry, \n113(2):211-222 (1974); Chou et al., \nAdv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol., \n47:45-148 (1978); Chou et al., \nAnn. Rev. Biochem., \n47:251-276 and Chou et al., \nBiophys. J., \n26:367-384 (1979). Moreover, computer programs are currently available to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of predicting secondary structure is based upon homology modeling. For example, two polypeptides or proteins which have a sequence identity of greater than 30%, or similarity greater than 40% often have similar structural topologies. The recent growth of the protein structural database (PDB) has provided enhanced predictability of secondary structure, including the potential number of folds within a polypeptide's or protein's structure. See Holm et al., \nNuci. Acid. Res., \n27(1):244-247 (1999). It has been suggested (Brenner et al., \nCurr. Op. Struct. Biol., \n7(3):369-376 (1997)) that there are a limited number of folds in a given polypeptide or protein and that once a critical number of structures have been resolved, structural prediction will become dramatically more accurate.\n\n\nAdditional methods of predicting secondary structure include “threading” (Jones, D., \nCurr. Opin. Struct. Biol., \n7(3):377-87 (1997); Sippl et al., \nStructure, \n4(1):15-19 (1996)), “profile analysis” (Bowie et al., \nScience, \n253:164-170 (1991); Gribskov et al., \nMeth. Enzym., \n183:146-159 (1990); Gribskov et al., \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci., \n84(13):4355-4358 (1987)), and “evolutionary linkage” (See Holm, supra (1999), and Brenner, supra (1997)).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, antibody variants include glycosylation variants wherein the number and/or type of glycosylation site has been altered compared to the amino acid sequences of the parent polypeptide. In certain embodiments, protein variants comprise a greater or a lesser number of N-linked glycosylation sites than the native protein. An N-linked glycosylation site is characterized by the sequence: Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr, wherein the amino acid residue designated as X may be any amino acid residue except proline. The substitution of amino acid residues to create this sequence provides a potential new site for the addition of an N-linked carbohydrate chain. Alternatively, substitutions which eliminate this sequence will remove an existing N-linked carbohydrate chain. Also provided is a rearrangement of N-linked carbohydrate chains wherein one or more N-linked glycosylation sites (typically those that are naturally occurring) are eliminated and one or more new N-linked sites are created. Additional preferred antibody variants include cysteine variants wherein one or more cysteine residues are deleted from or substituted for another amino acid (e.g., serine) as compared to the parent amino acid sequence. Cysteine variants may be useful when antibodies must be refolded into a biologically active conformation such as after the isolation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Cysteine variants generally have fewer cysteine residues than the native protein, and typically have an even number to minimize interactions resulting from unpaired cysteines.\n\n\nAccording to certain embodiments, amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and/or (5) confer or modify other functional properties on such polypeptides. According to certain embodiments, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (in certain embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (in certain embodiments, in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts). In certain embodiments, a conservative amino acid substitution typically may not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in Proteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W.H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984)); Introduction to Protein Structure (C. Branden and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton et at. Nature 354:105 (1991).\n\n\nThe specific binding agent molecules of this invention that are polypeptide or peptide substitution variants may have up to about ten to twelve percent of the original amino acid sequence replaced. For antibody variants, the heavy chain may have 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 amino acid replaced, while the light chain may have 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 amino acid replaced.\n\n\nDerivatives of Specific Binding Agents\n\n\nThe invention also provides derivatives of specific binding agent polypeptides. Derivatives include specific binding agent polypeptides bearing modifications other than insertion, deletion, or substitution of amino acid residues. Preferably, the modifications are covalent in nature, and include for example, chemical bonding with polymers, lipids, other organic, and inorganic moieties. Derivatives of the invention may be prepared to increase circulating half-life of a specific binding agent polypeptide, or may be designed to improve targeting capacity for the polypeptide to desired cells, tissues, or organs.\n\n\nThe invention further embraces derivative binding agents covalently modified to include one or more water soluble polymer attachments such as polyethylene glycol, polyoxyethylene glycol, or polypropylene glycol as described U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835, 4,496,689, 4,301,144, 4,670,417, 4,791,192 and 4,179,337. Still other useful polymers known in the art include monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, dextran, cellulose, or other carbohydrate based polymers, poly-(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)-polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol homopolymers, a polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymer, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol) and polyvinyl alcohol, as well as mixtures of these polymers. Particularly preferred are specific binding agent products covalently modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) subunits. Water-soluble polymers may be bonded at specific positions, for example at the amino terminus of the specific binding agent products, or randomly attached to one or more side chains of the polypeptide. The use of PEG for improving the therapeutic capacity for specific binding agent, and for humanized antibodies in particular, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,133,426 to Gonzales et al., issued Oct. 17, 2000.\n\n\nTarget Sites for Antibody Mutagenesis\n\n\nCertain strategies can be employed to manipulate inherent properties of an Ang-1 and/or Ang-2-specific antibody, such as the affinity of the antibody for its target. These strategies include the use of site-specific or random mutagenesis of the polynucleotide molecule encoding the antibody to generate antibody variants, followed by a screening step designed to recover antibody variants that exhibit the desired change, e.g. increased or decreased affinity.\n\n\nThe amino acid residues most commonly targeted in mutagenic strategies are those in the CDRs. As described supra, these regions contain the residues that actually interact with Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 and other amino acids that affect the spatial arrangement of these residues. However, amino acids in the framework regions of the variable domains outside the CDR regions have also been shown to make substantial contributions to the antigen-binding properties of the antibody, and can be targeted to manipulate such properties. See Hudson, \nCurr Opin Biotech, \n9:395-402 (1999) and references therein.\n\n\nSmaller and more effectively screened libraries of antibody variants can be produced by restricting random or site-directed mutagenesis to sites in the CDRs that correspond to areas prone to “hyper-mutation” during the somatic affinity maturation process. See Chowdhury and Pastan, \nNature Biotech, \n17: 568-572 [1999] and references therein. The types of DNA elements known to define hyper-mutation sites in this manner include direct and inverted repeats, certain consensus sequences, secondary structures, and palindromes. The consensus DNA sequences include the tetrabase sequence Purine-G-Pyrimidine-A/T (i.e. A or G-G-C or T-A or T) and the serine codon AGY (wherein Y can be a C or a T).\n\n\nThus, an embodiment of the present invention includes mutagenic strategies with the goal of increasing the affinity of an antibody for its target. These strategies include mutagenesis of the entire variable heavy and light chain, mutagenesis of the CDR regions only, mutagenesis of the consensus hypermutation sites within the CDRs, mutagenesis of framework regions, or any combination of these approaches (“mutagenesis” in this context could be random or site-directed). Definitive delineation of the CDR regions and identification of residues comprising the binding site of an antibody can be accomplished though solving the structure of the antibody in question, and the antibody-ligand complex, through techniques known to those skilled in the art, such as X-ray crystallography. Various methods based on analysis and characterization of such antibody crystal structures are known to those of skill in the art and can be employed, although not definitive, to approximate the CDR regions. Examples of such commonly used methods include the Kabat, Chothia, AbM and contact definitions.\n\n\nThe Kabat definition is based on the sequence variability and is the most commonly used definition to predict CDR regions. [Johnson and Wu, \nNucleic Acids Res, \n28: 214-8 (2000)]. The Chothia definition is based on the location of the structural loop regions. [Chothia et al., \nJ Mol Biol, \n196: 901-17 (1986); Chothia et al., \nNature, \n342: 877-83 (1989)]. The AbM definition is a compromise between the Kabat and Chothia definition. AbM is an integral suite of programs for antibody structure modeling produced by Oxford Molecular Group [Martin et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci \n(\nUSA\n) 86:9268-9272 (1989); Rees, et al., ABM™, a computer program for modeling variable regions of antibodies, Oxford, UK; Oxford Molecular, Ltd.]. The AbM suite models the tertiary structure of an antibody from primary sequencing using a combination of knowledge databases and ab initio methods. An additional definition, known as the contact definition, has been recently introduced. [MacCallum et al., \nJ Mol Biol, \n5:732-45 (1996)]. This definition is based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures.\n\n\nBy convention, the CDR regions in the heavy chain are typically referred to as H1, H2 and H3 and are numbered sequentially in order counting from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus. The CDR regions in the light chain are typically referred to as L1, L2 and L3 and are numbered sequentially in order counting from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus.\n\n\nThe CDR-H1 is approximately 10 to 12 residues in length and typically starts 4 residues after a Cys according to the Chothia and AbM definitions or typically 5 residues later according to the Kabat definition. The H1 is typically followed by a Trp, typically Trp-Val, but also Trp-Ile, or Trp-Ala. The length of H1 is approximately 10 to 12 residues according to the AbM definition while the Chothia definition excludes the last 4 residues.\n\n\nThe CDR-H2 typically starts 15 residues after the end of H1 according to the Kabat and AbM definition. The residues preceding H2 are typically Leu-Glu-Trp-11e-Gly but there are a number of variations. H2 is typically followed by the amino acid sequence Lys/Arg-Leu/Ile/Val/Phe/Thr/Ala-Thr/Ser/Ile/Ala. According to the Kabat definition, the length of the H2 is approximately 16 to 19 residues where the AbM definition predicts the length to be typically 9 to 12 residues.\n\n\nThe CDR-H3 typically starts 33 residues after the end of H2 and is typically preceded by the amino acid sequence (typically Cys-Ala-Arg). The H3 is typically followed by the amino acid sequence-Gly. The length of H3 can be anywhere between 3 to 25 residues.\n\n\nThe CDR-L1 typically starts at approximately \nresidue\n 24 and will typically follow a Cys. The residue after the CDR-L1 is always a Trp and will typically begin the sequence Trp-Tyr-Gln, Trp-Leu-Gln, Trp-Phe-Gln, or Trp-Tyr-Leu. The length of CDR-L1 is approximately 10 to 17 residues. The punitive CDR-L1 for the antibodies of the invention follows this pattern exactly with a Cys residue followed by 15 amino acids then Trp-Tyr-Gln.\n\n\nThe CDR-L2 starts approximately 16 residues after the end of L1. It will generally follow residues Ile-Tyr, Val-Tyr, Ile-Lys or Ile-Phe. The length of CDR-L2 is approximately 7 residues.\n\n\nThe CDR-L3 typically starts 33 residues after the end of L2 and typically follows a Cys. L3 is typically followed by the amino acid sequence Phe-Gly-XXX-Gly. The length of L3 is approximately 7 to 11 residues.\n\n\nVarious methods for modifying antibodies have been described in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,530,101 (to Queen et al., Jun. 25, 1996) describes methods to produce humanized antibodies wherein the sequence of the humanized immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework is 65% to 95% identical to the sequence of the donor immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework. Each humanized immunoglobulin chain will usually comprise, in addition to the CDRs, amino acids from the donor immunoglobulin framework that are, e.g., capable of interacting with the CDRs to affect binding affinity, such as one or more amino acids which are immediately adjacent to a CDR in the donor immunoglobulin or those within about 3 angstroms as predicted by molecular modeling. The heavy and light chains may each be designed by using any one or all of various position criteria. When combined into an intact antibody, the humanized immunoglobulins of the present invention will be substantially non-immunogenic in humans and retain substantially the same affinity as the donor immunoglobulin to the antigen, such as a protein or other compound containing an epitope. See also, related methods in U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,761 to Queen, et al., issued Dec. 2, 1997 (“Polynucleotides encoding improved humanized immunoglobulins”); U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,762 to Queen, et al., issued Dec. 2, 1997 (“Humanized Immunoglobulins”); U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089 to Queen, et al. issued Dec. 17, 1996 (“Humanized Immunoglobulins”).\n\n\nIn one example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,565,332 to Hoogenboom et al. issued Oct. 15, 1996 (“Production of chimeric antibodies—a combinatorial approach”) describes methods for the production of antibodies, and antibody fragments which have similar binding specificity as a parent antibody but which have increased human characteristics. Humanized antibodies are obtained by chain shuffling, using, for example, phage display technology, and a polypeptide comprising a heavy or light chain variable domain of a non-human antibody specific for an antigen of interest is combined with a repertoire of human complementary (light or heavy) chain variable domains. Hybrid pairings that are specific for the antigen of interest are identified and human chains from the selected pairings are combined with a repertoire of human complementary variable domains (heavy or light). In another embodiment, a component of a CDR from a non-human antibody is combined with a repertoire of component parts of CDRs from human antibodies. From the resulting library of antibody polypeptide dimers, hybrids are selected and used in a second humanizing shuffling step. Alternatively, this second step is eliminated if the hybrid is already of sufficient human character to be of therapeutic value. Methods of modification to increase human character are also described. See also Winter, \nFEBS Letts \n430:92-92 (1998).\n\n\nAs another example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,054,297 to Carter et al., issued Apr. 25, 2000 describes a method for making humanized antibodies by substituting a CDR amino acid sequence for the corresponding human CDR amino acid sequence and/or substituting a FR amino acid sequence for the corresponding human FR amino acid sequences.\n\n\nAs another example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,886 to Studnicka et al., issued Jun. 16, 1998 (“Modified antibody variable domains”) describes methods for identifying the amino acid residues of an antibody variable domain which may be modified without diminishing the native affinity of the antigen binding domain while reducing its immunogenicity with respect to a heterologous species and methods for preparing these modified antibody variable domains which are useful for administration to heterologous species. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,619 to Studnicka issued Feb. 9, 1999.\n\n\nAs discussed, modification of an antibody by any of the methods known in the art is typically designed to achieve increased binding affinity for an antigen and/or reduce immunogenicity of the antibody in the recipient. In one approach, humanized antibodies can be modified to eliminate glycosylation sites in order to increase affinity of the antibody for its cognate antigen [Co et al., \nMol Immunol \n30:1361-1367 (1993)]. Techniques such as “reshaping,” “hyperchimerization,” and “veneering/resurfacing” have produced humanized antibodies with greater therapeutic potential. [Vaswami et al., \nAnnals of Allergy, Asthma\n, & \nImmunol \n81:105 (1998); Roguska et al., \nProt Engineer \n9:895-904 (1996)]. See also U.S. Pat. No. 6,072,035 to Hardman et al., issued Jun. 6, 2000, which describes methods for reshaping antibodies. While these techniques diminish antibody immunogenicity by reducing the number of foreign residues, they do not prevent anti-idiotypic and anti-allotypic responses following repeated administration of the antibodies. Alternatives to these methods for reducing immunogenicity are described in Gilliland et al., \nJ Immunol \n62(6): 3663-71 (1999).\n\n\nIn many instances, humanizing antibodies result in a loss of antigen binding capacity. It is therefore preferable to “back mutate” the humanized antibody to include one or more of the amino acid residues found in the original (most often rodent) antibody in an attempt to restore binding affinity of the antibody. See, for example, Saldanha et al., \nMol Immunol \n36:709-19 (1999).\n\n\nNon-Peptide Specific Binding Agent Analogs/Protein Mimetics\n\n\nFurthermore, nonpeptide specific binding agent analogs of peptides that provide a stabilized structure or lessened bio-degradation, are also contemplated. Specific binding agent peptide mimetic analogs can be prepared based on a selected inhibitory peptide by replacement of one or more residues by nonpeptide moieties. Preferably, the nonpeptide moieties permit the peptide to retain its natural confirmation, or stabilize a preferred, e.g., bioactive, confirmation which retains the ability to recognize and bind Ang-1 and/or Ang-2. In one aspect, the resulting analog/mimetic exhibits increased binding affinity for Ang-1 and/or Ang-2. One example of methods for preparation of nonpeptide mimetic analogs from specific binding agent peptides is described in Nachman et al., \nRegul Pept \n57:359-370 (1995). If desired, the specific binding agent peptides of the invention can be modified, for instance, by glycosylation, amidation, carboxylation, or phosphorylation, or by the creation of acid addition salts, amides, esters, in particular C-terminal esters, and N-acyl derivatives of the peptides of the invention. The specific binding agent peptides also can be modified to create peptide derivatives by forming covalent or noncovalent complexes with other moieties. Covalently-bound complexes can be prepared by linking the chemical moieties to functional groups on the side chains of amino acids comprising the specific binding agent peptides, or at the N- or C-terminus.\n\n\nIn particular, it is anticipated that the specific binding agent peptides can be conjugated to a reporter group, including, but not limited to a radiolabel, a fluorescent label, an enzyme (e.g., that catalyzes a colorimetric or fluorometric reaction), a substrate, a solid matrix, or a carrier (e.g., biotin or avidin). The invention accordingly provides a molecule comprising an antibody molecule, wherein the molecule preferably further comprises a reporter group selected from the group consisting of a radiolabel, a fluorescent label, an enzyme, a substrate, a solid matrix, and a carrier. Such labels are well known to those of skill in the art, e.g., biotin labels are particularly contemplated. The use of such labels is well known to those of skill in the art and is described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,817,837; U.S. Pat. No. 3,850,752; U.S. Pat. No. 3,996,345 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,277,437. Other labels that will be useful include but are not limited to radioactive labels, fluorescent labels and chemiluminescent labels. U.S. Patents concerning use of such labels include for example U.S. Pat. No. 3,817,837; U.S. Pat. No. 3,850,752; U.S. Pat. No. 3,939,350 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,996,345. Any of the peptides of the present invention may comprise one, two, or more of any of these labels.\n\n\nMethods of Making Specific Binding Agents\n\n\nSpecific binding agents of the present invention that are proteins can be prepared by chemical synthesis in solution or on a solid support in accordance with conventional techniques. The current limit for solid phase synthesis is about 85-100 amino acids in length. However, chemical synthesis techniques can often be used to chemically ligate a series of smaller peptides to generate full length polypeptides. Various automatic synthesizers are commercially available and can be used in accordance with known protocols. See, for example, Stewart and Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2d. ed., Pierce Chemical Co., (1984); Tam et al., \nJ Am Chem Soc, \n105:6442, (1983); Merrifield, Science, 232:341-347, (1986); and Barany and Merrifield, The Peptides, Gross and Meienhofer, eds, Academic Press, New York, 1-284; Barany et al., Int. J. Peptide Protein Res., 30, 705-739 (1987); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,398), each incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nSolid phase peptide synthesis methods use a copoly(styrene-divinylbenzene) containing 0.1-1.0 mM amines/g polymer. These methods for peptide synthesis use butyloxycarbonyl (t-BOC) or 9-fluorenylmethyloxy-carbonyl(FMOC) protection of alpha-amino groups. Both methods involve stepwise syntheses whereby a single amino acid is added at each step starting from the C-terminus of the peptide (See, Coligan et al., Current Protocols in Immunology, Wiley Interscience, 1991, Unit 9). On completion of chemical synthesis, the synthetic peptide can be deprotected to remove the t-BOC or FMOC amino acid blocking groups and cleaved from the polymer by treatment with acid at reduced temperature (e.g., liquid HF-10% anisole for about 0.25 to about 1 hour at 0° C.). After evaporation of the reagents, the specific binding agent peptides are extracted from the polymer with 1% acetic acid solution that is then lyophilized to yield the crude material. This can normally be purified by such techniques as gel filtration on Sephadex G-15 using 5% acetic acid as a solvent. Lyophilization of appropriate fractions of the column will yield the homogeneous specific binding agent peptide or peptide derivatives, which can then be characterized by such standard techniques as amino acid analysis, thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, molar rotation, solubility, and quantitated by the solid phase Edman degradation.\n\n\nChemical synthesis of anti-Ang-1 and/or anti-Ang-2 antibodies, derivatives, variants, and fragments thereof, as well as other protein-based Ang-2 binding agents permits incorporation of non-naturally occurring amino acids into the agent.\n\n\nRecombinant DNA techniques are a convenient method for preparing full length antibodies and other large proteinaceous specific binding agents of the present invention, or fragments thereof. A cDNA molecule encoding the antibody or fragment may be inserted into an expression vector, which can in turn be inserted into a host cell for production of the antibody or fragment. It is understood that the cDNAs encoding such antibodies may be modified to vary from the “original” cDNA (translated from the mRNA) to provide for codon degeneracy or to permit codon preference usage in various host cells.\n\n\nGenerally, a DNA molecule encoding an antibody can be obtained using procedures described herein in the Examples. Where it is desirable to obtain Fab molecules or CDRs that are related to the original antibody molecule, one can screen a suitable library (phage display library; lymphocyte library, etc.) using standard techniques to identify and clone related Fabs/CDRs. Probes used for such screening may be full length or truncated Fab probes encoding the Fab portion of the original antibody, probes against one or more CDRs from the Fab portion of the original antibody, or other suitable probes. Where DNA fragments are used as probes, typical hybridization conditions are those such as set forth in Ausubel et. al. (Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Current Protocols Press [1994]). After hybridization, the probed blot can be washed at a suitable stringency, depending on such factors as probe size, expected homology of probe to clone, the type of library being screened, and the number of clones being screened. Examples of high stringency screening are 0.1×SSC, and 0.1 percent SDS at a temperature between 50-65° C.\n\n\nA variety of expression vector/host systems may be utilized to contain and express the polynucleotide molecules encoding the specific binding agent polypeptides of the invention. These systems include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria transformed with recombinant bacteriophage, plasmid or cosmid DNA expression vectors; yeast transformed with yeast expression vectors; insect cell systems infected with virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus); plant cell systems transfected with virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with bacterial expression vectors (e.g., Ti or pBR322 plasmid); or animal cell systems.\n\n\nMammalian cells that are useful in recombinant specific binding agent protein productions include but are not limited to VERO cells, HeLa cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, COS cells (such as COS-7), W138, BHK, HepG2, 3T3, RIN, MDCK, A549, PC12, K562 and 293 cells, as well as hybridoma cell lines as described herein. Mammalian cells are preferred for preparation of those specific binding agents such as antibodies and antibody fragments that are typically glycosylated and require proper refolding for activity. Preferred mammalian cells include CHO cells, hybridoma cells, and myeloid cells.\n\n\nSome exemplary protocols for the recombinant expression of the specific binding agent proteins are described herein below.\n\n\nThe term “expression vector” refers to a plasmid, phage, virus or vector, for expressing a polypeptide from a DNA (RNA) sequence. An expression vector can comprise a transcriptional unit comprising an assembly of (1) a genetic element or elements having a regulatory role in gene expression, for example, promoters or enhancers, (2) a structural or sequence that encodes the binding agent which is transcribed into mRNA and translated into protein, and (3) appropriate transcription initiation and termination sequences. Structural units intended for use in yeast or eukaryotic expression systems preferably include a leader sequence enabling extracellular secretion of translated protein by a host cell. Alternatively, where recombinant specific binding agent protein is expressed without a leader or transport sequence, it may include an amino terminal methionine residue. This residue may or may not be subsequently cleaved from the expressed recombinant protein to provide a final specific binding agent product.\n\n\nFor example, the specific binding agents may be recombinantly expressed in yeast using a commercially available expression system, e.g., the \nPichia \nExpression System (Invitrogen, San Diego, Calif.), following the manufacturer's instructions. This system also relies on the pre-pro-alpha sequence to direct secretion, but transcription of the insert is driven by the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter upon induction by methanol.\n\n\nThe secreted specific binding agent peptide is purified from the yeast growth medium by, e.g., the methods used to purify the peptide from bacterial and mammalian cell supernatants.\n\n\nAlternatively, the cDNA encoding the specific binding agent peptide may be cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1393 (PharMingen, San Diego, Calif.). This vector can be used according to the manufacturer's directions (PharMingen) to infect \nSpodoptera frugiperda \ncells in sF9 protein-free media and to produce recombinant protein. The specific binding agent protein can be purified and concentrated from the media using a heparin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia).\n\n\nAlternatively, the peptide may be expressed in an insect system. Insect systems for protein expression are well known to those of skill in the art. In one such system, \nAutographa californica \nnuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) can be used as a vector to express foreign genes in \nSpodoptera frugiperda \ncells or in \nTrichoplusia larvae\n. The specific binding agent peptide coding sequence can be cloned into a nonessential region of the virus, such as the polyhedrin gene, and placed under control of the polyhedrin promoter. Successful insertion of the specific binding agent peptide will render the polyhedrin gene inactive and produce recombinant virus lacking coat protein coat. The recombinant viruses can be used to infect \nS. frugiperda \ncells or \nTrichoplusia larvae \nin which peptide is expressed [Smith et al., \nJ Virol \n46: 584 (1983); Engelhard et al., \nProc Nat Acad Sci \n(\nUSA\n) 91: 3224-7 (1994)].\n\n\nIn another example, the DNA sequence encoding the specific binding agent peptide can be amplified by PCR and cloned into an appropriate vector for example, pGEX-3X (Pharmacia). The pGEX vector is designed to produce a fusion protein comprising glutathione-S-transferase (GST), encoded by the vector, and a specific binding agent protein encoded by a DNA fragment inserted into the vector's cloning site. The primers for the PCR can be generated to include for example, an appropriate cleavage site. Where the specific binding agent fusion moiety is used solely to facilitate expression or is otherwise not desirable as an attachment to the peptide of interest, the recombinant specific binding agent fusion protein may then be cleaved from the GST portion of the fusion protein. The pGEX-3X/specific binding agent peptide construct is transformed into \nE. coli \nXL-1 Blue cells (Stratagene, La Jolla Calif.), and individual transformants isolated and grown. Plasmid DNA from individual transformants can be purified and partially sequenced using an automated sequencer to confirm the presence of the desired specific binding agent encoding nucleic acid insert in the proper orientation.\n\n\nExpression of polynucleotides encoding anti-Ang-1 and/or anti-Ang-2 antibodies and fragments thereof using the recombinant systems described above may result in production of antibodies or fragments thereof that must be “re-folded” (to properly create various disulphide bridges) in order to be biologically active. Typical refolding procedures for such antibodies are set forth in the Examples herein and in the following section.\n\n\nSpecific binding agents made in bacterial cells may be produced as an insoluble inclusion body in the bacteria, can be purified as follows. Host cells can be sacrificed by centrifugation; washed in 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, \n \npH\n \n 8, 1 mM EDTA; and treated with 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) for 15 minutes at room temperature. The lysate can be cleared by sonication, and cell debris can be pelleted by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 12,000×g. The specific binding agent-containing pellet can be resuspended in 50 mM Tris, \n \npH\n \n 8, and 10 mM EDTA, layered over 50% glycerol, and centrifuged for 30 min. at 6000×g. The pellet can be resuspended in standard phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) free of Mg\n++\n and Ca\n++\n. The specific binding agent can be further purified by fractionating the resuspended pellet in a denaturing SDS polyacrylamide gel (Sambrook et al., supra). The gel can be soaked in 0.4 M KCl to visualize the protein, which can be excised and electroeluted in gel-running buffer lacking SDS. If the GST fusion protein is produced in bacteria, as a soluble protein, it can be purified using the GST Purification Module (Pharmacia).\n\n\nMammalian host systems for the expression of the recombinant protein are well known to those of skill in the art. Host cell strains can be chosen for a particular ability to process the expressed protein or produce certain post-translation modifications that will be useful in providing protein activity. Such modifications of the polypeptide include, but are not limited to, acetylation, carboxylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, lipidation and acylation. Different host cells such as CHO, HeLa, MDCK, 293, WI38, as well as hybridoma cell lines, and the like have specific cellular machinery and characteristic mechanisms for such post-translational activities and can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the introduced, foreign protein.\n\n\nA number of selection systems can be used to recover the cells that have been transformed for recombinant protein production. Such selection systems include, but are not limited to, HSV thymidine kinase, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase genes, in tk−, hgprt− or aprt− cells, respectively. Also, anti-metabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for DHFR which confers resistance to methotrexate; gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid; neo which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G418 and confers resistance to chlorsulfuron; and hygro which that confers resistance to hygromycin. Additional selectable genes that may be useful include trpB, which allows cells to utilize indole in place of tryptophan, or hisD, which allows cells to utilize histinol in place of histidine. Markers that give a visual indication for identification of transformants include anthocyanins, β-glucuronidase and its substrate, GUS, and luciferase and its substrate, luciferin.\n\n\nPurification and Refolding of Specific Binding Agents\n\n\nIn some cases, the specific binding agents produced using procedures described above may need to be “refolded” and oxidized into a proper tertiary structure and generating di-sulfide linkages in order to be biologically active. Refolding can be accomplished using a number of procedures well known in the art. Such methods include, for example, exposing the solubilized polypeptide agent to a pH usually above 7 in the presence of a chaotropic agent. The selection of chaotrope is similar to the choices used for inclusion body solubilization, however a chaotrope is typically used at a lower concentration. An exemplary chaotropic agent is guanidine. In most cases, the refolding/oxidation solution will also contain a reducing agent plus its oxidized form in a specific ratio to generate a particular redox potential which allows for dusykfide shuffling to occur for the formation of cysteine bridges. Some commonly used redox couples include cysteine/cystamine, glutathione/dithiobisGSH, cupric chloride, dithiothreitol DTT/dithiane DTT, and 2-mercaptoethanol (bME)/dithio-bME. In many instances, a co-solvent may be used to increase the efficiency of the refolding. Commonly used cosolvents include glycerol, polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, and arginine.\n\n\nIt will be desirable to purify specific binding agent proteins or variants thereof of the present invention. Protein purification techniques are well known to those of skill in the art. These techniques involve, at one level, the crude fractionation of the polypeptide and non-polypeptide fractions. Having separated the specific binding agent polypeptide from other proteins, the polypeptide of interest can be further purified using chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques to achieve partial or complete purification (or purification to homogeneity). Analytical methods particularly suited to the preparation of a pure specific binding agent peptide are ion-exchange chromatography, exclusion chromatography; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; isoelectric focusing. A particularly efficient method of purifying peptides is fast protein liquid chromatography or even HPLC.\n\n\nCertain aspects of the present invention concerns the purification, and in particular embodiments, the substantial purification, of an encoded specific binding agent protein or peptide. The term “purified specific binding agent protein or peptide” as used herein, is intended to refer to a composition, isolatable from other components, wherein the specific binding agent protein or peptide is purified to any degree relative to its naturally-obtainable state. A purified specific binding agent protein or peptide therefore also refers to a specific binding agent protein or peptide, free from the environment in which it may naturally occur.\n\n\nGenerally, “purified” will refer to a specific binding agent composition that has been subjected to fractionation to remove various other components, and which composition substantially retains its expressed biological activity. Where the term “substantially purified” is used, this designation will refer to a specific binding agent composition in which the specific binding agent protein or peptide forms the major component of the composition, such as constituting about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95% or more of the proteins in the composition.\n\n\nVarious methods for quantifying the degree of purification of the specific binding agent will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. These include, for example, determining the specific binding activity of an active fraction, or assessing the amount of specific binding agent polypeptides within a fraction by SDS/PAGE analysis. A preferred method for assessing the purity of a specific binding agent fraction is to calculate the binding activity of the fraction, to compare it to the binding activity of the initial extract, and to thus calculate the degree of purification, herein assessed by a “-fold purification number.” The actual units used to represent the amount of binding activity will, of course, be dependent upon the particular assay technique chosen to follow the purification and whether or not the expressed specific binding agent protein or peptide exhibits a detectable binding activity.\n\n\nVarious techniques suitable for use in specific binding agent protein purification will be well known to those of skill in the art. These include, for example, precipitation with ammonium sulphate, PEG, antibodies (immunoprecipitation) and the like or by heat denaturation, followed by centrifugation; chromatography steps such as affinity chromatography (e.g., Protein-A-Sepharose), ion exchange, gel filtration, reverse phase, hydroxylapatite and affinity chromatography; isoelectric focusing; gel electrophoresis; and combinations of such and other techniques. As is generally known in the art, it is believed that the order of conducting the various purification steps may be changed, or that certain steps may be omitted, and still result in a suitable method for the preparation of a substantially purified specific binding agent.\n\n\nThere is no general requirement that the specific binding agent always be provided in its most purified state. Indeed, it is contemplated that less substantially specific binding agent products will have utility in certain embodiments. Partial purification may be accomplished by using fewer purification steps in combination, or by utilizing different forms of the same general purification scheme. For example, it is appreciated that a cation-exchange column chromatography performed utilizing an HPLC apparatus will generally result in a greater “-fold” purification than the same technique utilizing a low-pressure chromatography system. Methods exhibiting a lower degree of relative purification may have advantages in total recovery of specific binding agent protein product, or in maintaining binding activity of an expressed specific binding agent protein.\n\n\nIt is known that the migration of a polypeptide can vary, sometimes significantly, with different conditions of SDS/PAGE [Capaldi et al., \nBiochem Biophys\\Res Comm, \n76: 425 (1977)]. It will therefore be appreciated that under differing electrophoresis conditions, the apparent molecular weights of purified or partially purified specific binding agent expression products may vary.\n\n\nBinding Assays\n\n\nImmunological binding assays typically utilize a capture agent to bind specifically to and often immobilize the analyte target antigen. The capture agent is a moiety that specifically binds to the analyte. In one embodiment of the present invention, the capture agent is an antibody or fragment thereof that specifically binds Ang-2 and/or Ang-1. These immunological binding assays are well known in the art [see, Asai, ed., Methods in Cell Biology, Vol. 37, Antibodies in Cell Biology, Academic Press, Inc., New York (1993)].\n\n\nImmunological binding assays frequently utilize a labeling agent that will signal the existence of the bound complex formed by the capture agent and antigen. The labeling agent can be one of the molecules comprising the bound complex; i.e. it can be labeled specific binding agent or a labeled anti-specific binding agent antibody. Alternatively, the labeling agent can be a third molecule, commonly another antibody, which binds to the bound complex. The labeling agent can be, for example, an anti-specific binding agent antibody bearing a label. The second antibody, specific for the bound complex, may lack a label, but can be bound by a fourth molecule specific to the species of antibodies which the second antibody is a member of. For example, the second antibody can be modified with a detectable moiety, such as biotin, which can then be bound by a fourth molecule, such as enzyme-labeled streptavidin. Other proteins capable of specifically binding immunoglobulin constant regions, such as protein A or protein G may also be used as the labeling agent. These binding proteins are normal constituents of the cell walls of streptococcal bacteria and exhibit a strong non-immunogenic reactivity with immunoglobulin constant regions from a variety of species [see, generally Akerstrom, \nJ Immunol, \n135:2589-2542 (1985); and Chaubert, \nMod Pathol, \n10:585-591 (1997)].\n\n\nThroughout the assays, incubation and/or washing steps may be required after each combination of reagents. Incubation steps can vary from about 5 seconds to several hours, preferably from about 5 minutes to about 24 hours. However, the incubation time will depend upon the assay format, analyte, volume of solution, concentrations, and the like. Usually, the assays will be carried out at ambient temperature, although they can be conducted over a range of temperatures.\n\n\nA. Non-Competitive Binding Assays:\n\n\nImmunological binding assays can be of the non-competitive type. These assays have an amount of captured analyte that is directly measured. For example, in one preferred “sandwich” assay, the capture agent (antibody) can be bound directly to a solid substrate where it is immobilized. These immobilized antibodies then capture (bind to) antigen present in the test sample. The protein thus immobilized is then bound to a labeling agent, such as a second antibody having a label. In another preferred “sandwich” assay, the second antibody lacks a label, but can be bound by a labeled antibody specific for antibodies of the species from which the second antibody is derived. The second antibody also can be modified with a detectable moiety, such as biotin, to which a third labeled molecule can specifically bind, such as streptavidin. [See, Harlow and Lane, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, \nCh\n 14, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY (1988), incorporated herein by reference].\n\n\nB. Competitive Binding Assays:\n\n\nImmunological binding assays can be of the competitive type. The amount of analyte present in the sample is measure indirectly by measuring the amount of an added analyte displaced, or competed away, from a capture agent by the analyte present in the sample. In one preferred competitive binding assay, a known amount of analyte, usually labeled, is added to the sample and the sample is then contacted with an antibody (the capture agent). The amount of labeled analyze bound to the antibody is inversely proportional to the concentration of analyte present in the sample. (See, Harlow and Lane, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, \nCh\n 14, pp. 579-583, supra).\n\n\nIn another preferred competitive binding assay, the antibody is immobilized on a solid substrate. The amount of protein bound to the antibody may be determined either by measuring the amount of protein present in a protein/antibody complex, or alternatively by measuring the amount of remaining uncomplexed protein. The amount of protein may be detected by providing a labeled protein. See, Harlow and Lane, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, \nCh\n 14, supra).\n\n\nYet another preferred competitive binding assay, hapten inhibition is utilized. Here, a known analyte is immobilized on a solid substrate. A known amount of antibody is added to the sample, and the sample is contacted with the immobilized analyte. The amount of antibody bound to the immobilized analyte is inversely proportional to the amount of analyte present in the sample. The amount of immobilized antibody may be detected by detecting either the immobilized fraction of antibody or the fraction that remains in solution. Detection may be direct where the antibody is labeled or indirect by the subsequent addition of a labeled moiety that specifically binds to the antibody as described above.\n\n\nC. Utilization of Competitive Binding Assays:\n\n\nThe competitive binding assays can be used for cross-reactivity determinations to permit a skilled artisan to determine if a protein or enzyme complex which is recognized by a specific binding agent of the invention is the desired protein and not a cross-reacting molecule or to determine whether the antibody is specific for the antigen and does not bind unrelated antigens. In assays of this type, antigen can be immobilized to a solid support and an unknown protein mixture is added to the assay, which will compete with the binding of the specific binding agents to the immobilized protein. The competing molecule also binds one or more antigens unrelated to the antigen. The ability of the proteins to compete with the binding of the specific binding agents antibodies to the immobilized antigen is compared to the binding by the same protein that was immobilized to the solid support to determine the cross-reactivity of the protein mix.\n\n\nD. Other Binding Assays:\n\n\nThe present invention also provides Western blot methods to detect or quantify the presence of Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 in a sample. The technique generally comprises separating sample proteins by gel electrophoresis on the basis of molecular weight and transferring the proteins to a suitable solid support, such as nitrocellulose filter, a nylon filter, or derivatized nylon filter. The sample is incubated with antibodies or fragments thereof that specifically bind Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 and the resulting complex is detected. These antibodies may be directly labeled or alternatively may be subsequently detected using labeled antibodies that specifically bind to the antibody.\n\n\nBinding assays to detect those Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 specific binding agents that disrupt Ang-2 binding to its receptor are set forth in the Examples herein.\n\n\nDiagnostic Assays\n\n\nThe antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof of present invention are useful for the diagnosis of conditions or diseases characterized by expression of Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 or subunits, or in assays to monitor patients being treated with inducers of Ang-1 and/or Ang-2, its fragments, agonists or inhibitors of Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 activity. Diagnostic assays for Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 include methods utilizing a specific binding agent and a label to detect Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 in human body fluids or extracts of cells or tissues. The specific binding agents of the present invention can be used with or without modification. In a preferred diagnostic assay, the specific binding agents will be labeled by attaching, e.g., a label or a reporter molecule. A wide variety of labels and reporter molecules are known, some of which have been already described herein. In particular, the present invention is useful for diagnosis of human disease.\n\n\nA variety of protocols for measuring Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 proteins using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for the respective protein are known in the art. Examples include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA) and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes on Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 is preferred, but a competitive binding assay can be employed. These assays are described, for example, in Maddox et al., \nJ Exp Med, \n158:1211 [1983].\n\n\nIn order to provide a basis for diagnosis, normal or standard values for human Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 expression are usually established. This determination can be accomplished by combining body fluids or cell extracts from normal subjects, preferably human, with a specific binding agent, for example, an antibody, to Ang-1 and/or Ang-2, under conditions suitable for complex formation that are well known in the art. The amount of standard complex formation can be quantified by comparing the binding of the specific binding agents to known quantities of Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 protein, with both control and disease samples. Then, standard values obtained from normal samples can be compared with values obtained from samples from subjects potentially affected by disease. Deviation between standard and subject values suggests a role for Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 in the disease state.\n\n\nFor diagnostic applications, in certain embodiments, specific binding agents typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety. The detectable moiety can be any one that is capable of producing, either directly or indirectly, a detectable signal. For example, the detectable moiety may be a radioisotope, such as \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, or \n125\nI, a fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, or luciferin; or an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, or horseradish peroxidase [Bayer et al., \nMeth Enz, \n184: 138-163, (1990)].\n\n\nDiseases\n\n\nThe present invention provides a specific binding agent that binds to Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 that is useful for the treatment of human diseases and pathological conditions. Agents that modulate Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 binding activity, or other cellular activity, may be used in combination with other therapeutic agents to enhance their therapeutic effects or decrease potential side effects.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention provides reagents and methods useful for treating diseases and conditions characterized by undesirable or aberrant levels of Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 activity in a cell. These diseases include cancers, and other hyperproliferative conditions, such as hyperplasia, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, immunological disorders, and infertility.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides methods of treating cancer in an animal, including humans, comprising administering to the animal an effective amount of a specific binding agent that inhibits or decreases Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 activity. The invention is further directed to methods of inhibiting cancer cell growth, including processes of cellular proliferation, invasiveness, and metastasis in biological systems. Methods include use of a compound of the invention as an inhibitor of cancer cell growth. Preferably, the methods are employed to inhibit or reduce cancer cell growth, invasiveness, metastasis, or tumor incidence in living animals, such as mammals. Methods of the invention are also readily adaptable for use in assay systems, e.g., assaying cancer cell growth and properties thereof, as well as identifying compounds that affect cancer cell growth.\n\n\nThe cancers treatable by methods of the present invention preferably occur in mammals. Mammals include, for example, humans and other primates, as well as pet or companion animals such as dogs and cats, laboratory animals such as rats, mice and rabbits, and farm animals such as horses, pigs, sheep, and cattle.\n\n\nTumors or neoplasms include growths of tissue cells in which the multiplication of the cells is uncontrolled and progressive. Some such growths are benign, but others are termed malignant and may lead to death of the organism. Malignant neoplasms or cancers are distinguished from benign growths in that, in addition to exhibiting aggressive cellular proliferation, they may invade surrounding tissues and metastasize. Moreover, malignant neoplasms are characterized in that they show a greater loss of differentiation (greater dedifferentiation), and of their organization relative to one another and their surrounding tissues. This property is also called “anaplasia.”\n\n\nNeoplasms treatable by the present invention also include solid tumors, i.e., carcinomas and sarcomas. Carcinomas include those malignant neoplasms derived from epithelial cells that infiltrate (invade) the surrounding tissues and give rise to metastases. Adenocarcinomas are carcinomas derived from glandular tissue, or which form recognizable glandular structures. Another broad category or cancers includes sarcomas, which are tumors whose cells are embedded in a fibrillar or homogeneous substance like embryonic connective tissue. The invention also enables treatment of cancers of the myeloid or lymphoid systems, including leukemias, lymphomas and other cancers that typically do not present as a tumor mass, but are distributed in the vascular or lymphoreticular systems.\n\n\nThe type of cancer or tumor cells amenable to treatment according to the invention include, for example, ACTH-producing tumor, acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, cancer of the adrenal cortex, bladder cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, colorectal cancer, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, Ewing's sarcoma, gallbladder cancer, hairy cell leukemia, head and neck cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, kidney cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer (small and non-small cell), malignant peritoneal effusion, malignant pleural effusion, melanoma, mesothelioma, multiple myeloma, neuroblastoma, glioma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, ovarian (germ cell) cancer, pancreatic cancer, penile cancer, prostate cancer, retinoblastoma, skin cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, squamous cell carcinomas, stomach cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid cancer, trophoblastic neoplasms, uterine cancer, vaginal cancer, cancer of the vulva, and Wilms' tumor.\n\n\nThe invention is particularly illustrated herein in reference to treatment of certain types of experimentally defined cancers. In these illustrative treatments, standard state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo models have been used. These methods can be used to identify agents that can be expected to be efficacious in in vivo treatment regimens. However, it will be understood that the method of the invention is not limited to the treatment of these tumor types, but extends to any solid tumor derived from any organ system. Cancers whose invasiveness or metastasis is associated with Ang-2 expression or activity are especially susceptible to being inhibited or even induced to regress by means of the invention.\n\n\nThe invention can also be practiced by including with a specific binding agent of the invention, such as an antibody, in combination with another anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agent, such as any conventional chemotherapeutic agent. The combination of a specific binding agent with such other agents can potentiate the chemotherapeutic protocol. Numerous chemotherapeutic protocols will present themselves in the mind of the skilled practitioner as being capable of incorporation into the method of the invention. Any chemotherapeutic agent can be used, including alkylating agents, antimetabolites, hormones and antagonists, radioisotopes, as well as natural products. For example, the compound of the invention can be administered with antibiotics such as doxorubicin and other anthracycline analogs, nitrogen mustards such as cyclophosphamide, pyrimidine analogs such as 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, hydroxyurea, taxol and its natural and synthetic derivatives, and the like. As another example, in the case of mixed tumors, such as adenocarcinoma of the breast, where the tumors include gonadotropin-dependent and gonadotropin-independent cells, the compound can be administered in conjunction with leuprolide or goserelin (synthetic peptide analogs of LH-RH). Other antineoplastic protocols include the use of a tetracycline compound with another treatment modality, e.g., surgery, radiation, etc., also referred to herein as “adjunct antineoplastic modalities.” Thus, the method of the invention can be employed with such conventional regimens with the benefit of reducing side effects and enhancing efficacy.\n\n\nThe present invention thus provides compositions and methods useful for the treatment of a wide variety of cancers, including solid tumors and leukemias. Types of cancer that may be treated include, but are not limited to: adenocarcinoma of the breast, prostate, and colon; all forms of bronchogenic carcinoma of the lung; myeloid; melanoma; hepatoma; neuroblastoma; papilloma; apudoma; choristoma; branchioma; malignant carcinoid syndrome; carcinoid heart disease; carcinoma (e.g., Walker, basal cell, basosquamous, Brown-Pearce, ductal, Ehrlich tumor, \nKrebs\n 2, merkel cell, mucinous, non-small cell lung, oat cell, papillary, scirrhous, bronchiolar, bronchogenic, squamous cell, and transitional cell); histiocytic disorders; leukemia; histiocytosis malignant; Hodgkin's disease; immunoproliferative small lung cell carcinoma; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; plasmacytoma; reticuloendotheliosis; melanoma; chondroblastoma; chondroma; chondrosarcoma; fibroma; fibrosarcoma; giant cell tumors; histiocytoma; lipoma; liposarcoma; mesothelioma; myxoma; myxosarcoma; osteoma; osteosarcoma; chordoma; craniopharyngioma; dysgerminoma; hamartoma; mesenchymoma; mesonephroma; myosarcoma; ameloblastoma; cementoma; odontoma; teratoma; thymoma; tophoblastic tumor. Further, the following types of cancers may also be treated: adenoma; cholangioma; cholesteatoma; cyclindroma; cystadenocarcinoma; cystadenoma; granulosa cell tumor; gynandroblastoma; hepatoma; hidradenoma; islet cell tumor; Leydig cell tumor; papilloma; Sertoli cell tumor; theca cell tumor; leiomyoma; leiomyosarcoma; myoblastoma; myoma; myosarcoma; rhabdomyoma; rhabdomyosarcoma; ependymoma; ganglioneuroma; glioma; medulloblastoma; meningioma; neurilemmoma; neuroblastoma; neuroepithelioma; neurofibroma; neuroma; paraganglioma; paraganglioma nonchromaffin; angiokeratoma; angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia; angioma sclerosing; angiomatosis; glomangioma; hemangioendothelioma; hemangioma; hemangiopericytoma; hemangiosarcoma; lymphangioma; lymphangiomyoma; lymphangiosarcoma; pinealoma; carcinosarcoma; chondrosarcoma; cystosarcoma phyllodes; fibrosarcoma; hemangiosarcoma; leiomyosarcoma; leukosarcoma; liposarcoma; lymphangiosarcoma; myosarcoma; myxosarcoma; ovarian carcinoma; rhabdomyosarcoma; sarcoma; neoplasms; nerofibromatosis; and cervical dysplasia.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention is using the materials and methods of the present invention to prevent and/or treat any hyperproliferative condition of the skin including psoriasis and contact dermatitis or other hyperproliferative diseases. It has been demonstrated that patients with psoriasis and contact dermatitis have elevated Ang-2 activity within these lesions [Ogoshi et al., \nJ. Inv. Dermatol., \n110:818-23 (1998)]. Preferably, specific binding agents specific for Ang-2 will be used in combination with other pharmaceutical agents to treat humans that express these clinical symptoms. The specific binding agents can be delivered using any of the various carriers through routes of administration described herein and others that are well known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\nOther aspects of the present invention include treating various retinopathies (including diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration) in which angiogenesis is involved, as well as disorders/diseases of the female reproductive tract such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and other such conditions associated with dysfunctional vascular proliferation (including endometrial microvascular growth) during the female reproductive cycle.\n\n\nStill another aspect of the present invention relates to treating abnormal vascular growth including cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) gastrointestinal mucosal injury and repair, ulceration of the gastroduodenal mucosa in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease, including ischemia resulting from stroke, a wide spectrum of pulmonary vascular disorders in liver disease and portal hypertension in patients with nonhepatic portal hypertension.\n\n\nAnother aspect of present invention is the prevention of cancers utilizing the compositions and methods provided by the present invention. Such reagents will include specific binding agents against Ang-2.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions of Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 specific binding agents are within the scope of the present invention. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising antibodies are described in detail in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,171,586, to Lam et al., issued Jan. 9, 2001. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a specific binding agent, such as an antibody, or a fragment, variant, derivative or fusion thereof as described herein, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable agent. In a preferred embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions comprise antagonist specific binding agents that modulate partially or completely at least one biological activity of Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable agent. Typically, the specific binding agents will be sufficiently purified for administration to an animal\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical composition may contain formulation materials for modifying, maintaining or preserving, for example, the pH, osmolarity, viscosity, clarity, color, isotonicity, odor, sterility, stability, rate of dissolution or release, adsorption or penetration of the composition. Suitable formulation materials include, but are not limited to, amino acids (such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine); antimicrobials; antioxidants (such as ascorbic acid, sodium sulfite or sodium hydrogen-sulfite); buffers (such as borate, bicarbonate, Tris-HCl, citrates, phosphates, other organic acids); bulking agents (such as mannitol or glycine), chelating agents [such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)]; complexing agents (such as caffeine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, beta-cyclodextrin or hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin); fillers; monosaccharides; disaccharides and other carbohydrates (such as glucose, mannose, or dextrins); proteins (such as serum albumin, gelatin or immunoglobulins); coloring; flavoring and diluting agents; emulsifying agents; hydrophilic polymers (such as polyvinylpyrrolidone); low molecular weight polypeptides; salt-forming counter ions (such as sodium); preservatives (such as benzalkonium chloride, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, thimerosal, phenethyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, chlorhexidine, sorbic acid or hydrogen peroxide); solvents (such as glycerin, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol); sugar alcohols (such as mannitol or sorbitol); suspending agents; surfactants or wetting agents (such as pluronics, PEG, sorbitan esters, polysorbates such as polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80, triton, tromethamine, lecithin, cholesterol, tyloxapal); stability enhancing agents (sucrose or sorbitol); tonicity enhancing agents (such as alkali metal halides (preferably sodium or potassium chloride, mannitol sorbitol); delivery vehicles; diluents; excipients and/or pharmaceutical adjuvants. (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, A. R. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Company, 1990).\n\n\nThe optimal pharmaceutical composition will be determined by one skilled in the art depending upon, for example, the intended route of administration, delivery format, and desired dosage. See for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra. Such compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the specific binding agent.\n\n\nThe primary vehicle or carrier in a pharmaceutical composition may be either aqueous or non-aqueous in nature. For example, a suitable vehicle or carrier may be water for injection, physiological saline solution or artificial cerebrospinal fluid, possibly supplemented with other materials common in compositions for parenteral administration. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles. Other exemplary pharmaceutical compositions comprise Tris buffer of about pH 7.0-8.5, or acetate buffer of about pH 4.0-5.5, which may further include sorbitol or a suitable substitute therefore. In one embodiment of the present invention, binding agent compositions may be prepared for storage by mixing the selected composition having the desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra) in the form of a lyophilized cake or an aqueous solution. Further, the binding agent product may be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipients such as sucrose.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be selected for parenteral delivery. Alternatively, the compositions may be selected for inhalation or for enteral delivery such as orally, aurally, opthalmically, rectally, or vaginally. The preparation of such pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is within the skill of the art.\n\n\nThe formulation components are present in concentrations that are acceptable to the site of administration. For example, buffers are used to maintain the composition at physiological pH or at slightly lower pH, typically within a pH range of from about 5 to about 8.\n\n\nWhen parenteral administration is contemplated, the therapeutic compositions for use in this invention may be in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution comprising the desired specific binding agent in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. A particularly suitable vehicle for parenteral injection is sterile distilled water in which a binding agent is formulated as a sterile, isotonic solution, properly preserved. Yet another preparation can involve the formulation of the desired molecule with an agent, such as injectable microspheres, bio-erodible particles, polymeric compounds (polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid), beads, or liposomes, that provides for the controlled or sustained release of the product which may then be delivered via a depot injection. Hyaluronic acid may also be used, and this may have the effect of promoting sustained duration in the circulation. Other suitable means for the introduction of the desired molecule include implantable drug delivery devices.\n\n\nIn another aspect, pharmaceutical formulations suitable for parenteral administration may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks' solution, ringer's solution, or physiologically buffered saline. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils, such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate, triglycerides, or liposomes. Non-lipid polycationic amino polymers may also be used for delivery. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents to increase the solubility of the compounds and allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition may be formulated for inhalation. For example, a binding agent may be formulated as a dry powder for inhalation. Polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule inhalation solutions may also be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery. In yet another embodiment, solutions may be nebulized. Pulmonary administration is further described in PCT Application No. PCT/US94/001875, which describes pulmonary delivery of chemically modified proteins.\n\n\nIt is also contemplated that certain formulations may be administered orally. In one embodiment of the present invention, binding agent molecules that are administered in this fashion can be formulated with or without those carriers customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. For example, a capsule may be designed to release the active portion of the formulation at the point in the gastrointestinal tract when bioavailability is maximized and pre-systemic degradation is minimized. Additional agents can be included to facilitate absorption of the binding agent molecule. Diluents, flavorings, low melting point waxes, vegetable oils, lubricants, suspending agents, tablet disintegrating agents, and binders may also be employed.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can also be formulated using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art in dosages suitable for oral administration. Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical compositions to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, and the like, for ingestion by the patient.\n\n\nPharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained through combining active compounds with solid excipient and processing the resultant mixture of granules (optionally, after grinding) to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable auxiliaries can be added, if desired. Suitable excipients include carbohydrate or protein fillers, such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, and sorbitol; starch from corn, wheat, rice, potato, or other plants; cellulose, such as methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, or sodium carboxymethylcellulose; gums, including arabic and tragacanth; and proteins, such as gelatin and collagen. If desired, disintegrating or solubilizing agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, and alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate.\n\n\nDragee cores may be used in conjunction with suitable coatings, such as concentrated sugar solutions, which may also contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for product identification or to characterize the quantity of active compound, i.e., dosage.\n\n\nPharmaceutical preparations that can be used orally also include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a coating, such as glycerol or sorbitol. Push-fit capsules can contain active ingredients mixed with fillers or binders, such as lactose or starches, lubricants, such as talc or magnesium stearate, and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid, or liquid polyethylene glycol with or without stabilizers.\n\n\nAnother pharmaceutical composition may involve an effective quantity of binding agent in a mixture with non-toxic excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. By dissolving the tablets in sterile water, or other appropriate vehicle, solutions can be prepared in unit dose form. Suitable excipients include, but are not limited to, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or bicarbonate, lactose, or calcium phosphate; or binding agents, such as starch, gelatin, or acacia; or lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or talc.\n\n\nAdditional pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those skilled in the art, including formulations involving binding agent molecules in sustained- or controlled-delivery formulations. Techniques for formulating a variety of other sustained- or controlled-delivery means, such as liposome carriers, bio-erodible microparticles or porous beads and depot injections, are also known to those skilled in the art. See for example, PCT/US93/00829 that describes controlled release of porous polymeric microparticles for the delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. Additional examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices may include polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919, EP 58,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate [Sidman et al., \nBiopolymers, \n22:547-556 (1983)], poly (2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) [Langer et al., \nJ Biomed Mater Res, \n15:167-277, (1981)] and [Langer et al., \nChem Tech, \n12:98-105 (1982)], ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra) or poly-D(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988). Sustained-release compositions also include liposomes, which can be prepared by any of several methods known in the art. See e.g., Eppstein et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci \n(\nUSA\n), 82:3688-3692 (1985); EP 36,676; EP 88,046; EP 143,949.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical composition to be used for in vivo administration typically must be sterile. This may be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. Where the composition is lyophilized, sterilization using this method may be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. The composition for parenteral administration may be stored in lyophilized form or in solution. In addition, parenteral compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.\n\n\nOnce the pharmaceutical composition has been formulated, it may be stored in sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or a dehydrated or lyophilized powder. Such formulations may be stored either in a ready-to-use form or in a form (e.g., lyophilized) requiring reconstitution prior to administration.\n\n\nIn a specific embodiment, the present invention is directed to kits for producing a single-dose administration unit. The kits may each contain both a first container having a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous formulation. Also included within the scope of this invention are kits containing single and multi-chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and lyosyringes).\n\n\nAn effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for treatment will thus vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the indication for which the binding agent molecule is being used, the route of administration, and the size (body weight, body surface or organ size) and condition (the age and general health) of the patient. Accordingly, the clinician may titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. A typical dosage may range from about 0.1 mg/kg to up to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In other embodiments, the dosage may range from 0.1 mg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 1 mg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 5 mg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg.\n\n\nFor any compound, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays or in animal models such as mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, or pigs. An animal model may also be used to determine the appropriate concentration range and route of administration. Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans.\n\n\nThe exact dosage will be determined in light of factors related to the subject requiring treatment. Dosage and administration are adjusted to provide sufficient levels of the active compound or to maintain the desired effect. Factors that may be taken into account include the severity of the disease state, the general health of the subject, the age, weight, and gender of the subject, time and frequency of administration, drug combination(s), reaction sensitivities, and response to therapy. Long-acting pharmaceutical compositions may be administered every 3 to 4 days, every week, or biweekly depending on the half-life and clearance rate of the particular formulation.\n\n\nThe frequency of dosing will depend upon the pharmacokinetic parameters of the binding agent molecule in the formulation used. Typically, a composition is administered until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The composition may therefore be administered as a single dose, or as multiple doses (at the same or different concentrations/dosages) over time, or as a continuous infusion. Further refinement of the appropriate dosage is routinely made. Appropriate dosages may be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data.\n\n\nThe route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is in accord with known methods, e.g. orally, through injection by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intra-parenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular, intra-ocular, intraarterial, intraportal, intralesional routes, intramedullary, intrathecal, intraventricular, transdermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, enteral, topical, sublingual, urethral, vaginal, or rectal means, by sustained release systems or by implantation devices. Where desired, the compositions may be administered by bolus injection or continuously by infusion, or by implantation device.\n\n\nAlternatively or additionally, the composition may be administered locally via implantation of a membrane, sponge, or another appropriate material on to which the desired molecule has been absorbed or encapsulated. Where an implantation device is used, the device may be implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery of the desired molecule may be via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or continuous administration.\n\n\nIn some cases, it may be desirable to use pharmaceutical compositions in an ex vivo manner. In such instances, cells, tissues, or organs that have been removed from the patient are exposed to the pharmaceutical compositions after which the cells, tissues and/or organs are subsequently implanted back into the patient.\n\n\nIn other cases, a binding agent which is a polypeptide can be delivered by implanting certain cells that have been genetically engineered, using methods such as those described herein, to express and secrete the polypeptide. Such cells may be animal or human cells, and may be autologous, heterologous, or xenogeneic. Optionally, the cells may be immortalized. In order to decrease the chance of an immunological response, the cells may be encapsulated to avoid infiltration of surrounding tissues. The encapsulation materials are typically biocompatible, semi-permeable polymeric enclosures or membranes that allow the release of the protein product(s) but prevent the destruction of the cells by the patient's immune system or by other detrimental factors from the surrounding tissues.\n\n\nCombination Therapy\n\n\nSpecific binding agents of the invention can be utilized in combination with other therapeutic in the treatment of Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 pathologies. These other therapeutics include, for example radiation treatment, chemotherapeutic agents, as well as other growth factors or inhibitors.\n\n\nChemotherapy treatment can employ anti-neoplastic agents including, for example, alkylating agents including: nitrogen mustards, such as mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan and chlorambucil; nitrosoureas, such as carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), and semustine (methyl-CCNU); ethylenimines/methylmelamine such as thriethylenemelamine (TEM), triethylene, thiophosphoramide (thiotepa), hexamethylmelamine (HMM, altretamine); alkyl sulfonates such as busulfan; triazines such as dacarbazine (DTIC); antimetabolites including folic acid analogs such as methotrexate and trimetrexate, pyrimidine analogs such as 5-fluorouracil, fluorodeoxyuridine, gemcitabine, cytosine arabinoside (AraC, cytarabine), 5-azacytidine, 2,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine, purine analogs such as 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, azathioprine, 2′-deoxycoformycin (pentostatin), erythrohydroxynonyladenine (EHNA), fludarabine phosphate, and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (cladribine, 2-CdA); natural products including antimitotic drugs such as paclitaxel, vinca alkaloids including vinblastine (VLB), vincristine, and vinorelbine, taxotere, estramustine, and estramustine phosphate; ppipodophylotoxins such as etoposide and teniposide; antibiotics such as actimomycin D, daunomycin (rubidomycin), doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, idarubicin, bleomycins, plicamycin (mithramycin), mitomycinC, and actinomycin; enzymes such as L-asparaginase; biological response modifiers such as interferon-alpha, IL-2, G-CSF and GM-CSF; miscellaneous agents including platinum coordination complexes such as cisplatin and carboplatin, anthracenediones such as mitoxantrone, substituted urea such as hydroxyurea, methylhydrazine derivatives including N-methylhydrazine (MIH) and procarbazine, adrenocortical suppressants such as mitotane (o,p′-DDD) and aminoglutethimide; hormones and antagonists including adrenocorticosteroid antagonists such as prednisone and equivalents, dexamethasone and aminoglutethimide; progestin such as hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate; estrogen such as diethylstilbestrol and ethinyl estradiol equivalents; antiestrogen such as tamoxifen; androgens including testosterone propionate and fluoxymesterone/equivalents; antiandrogens such as flutamide, gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs and leuprolide; and non-steroidal antiandrogens such as flutamide.\n\n\nCombination therapy can done in conjunction with the growth factors listed below or with agents that are designed to inhibit the growth factors listed below. The growth factors include cytokines, lymphokines, growth factors, or other hematopoietic factors such as M-CSF, GM-CSF, TNF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-14, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IFN, TNF0, TNF1, TNF2, G-CSF, Meg-CSF, GM-CSF, thrombopoietin, stem cell factor, and erythropoietin.

Examples of such specific binding agents are provided in WO 2007/027713, incorporated herein by reference, which discloses agonistic antibodies that induce apoptosis via the DR5 receptor.\n\n\nImmunotherapeutics\n\n\nImmunotherapeutics generally rely on the use of immune effector cells and molecules to target and destroy cancer cells. The immune effectors may be, for example an antibody of the present invention that recognizes some marker on the surface of a target cell. The antibody alone may serve as an effector of therapy or it may recruit other cells to actually effect cell killing. The antibody may also be conjugated to a drug or toxin (chemotherapeutic, radionuclide, ricin A chain, cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, etc.) and thus may merely serve as a targeting agent.\n\n\nAccording to the present invention, mutant forms of Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 may be targeted by immunotherapy either antibodies or antibody conjugates of the invention. It is particularly contemplated that the antibody compositions of the invention may be used in a combined therapy approach in conjunction with Ang-2 targeted therapy.\n\n\nPassive immunotherapy has proved to be particularly effective against a number of cancers. See, for example, WO 98/39027.\n\n\nThe following examples are intended for illustration purposes only, and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nGeneration of Affinity Matured Antibodies Against Ang2 by Phage Display\n\n\nOverall Strategy\n\n\nCDR randomization was employed to enhance the activity of Ang2 antibody, similar to previous approaches (Chen Y et al., 1999 J Mol Biol (293)865-881; Yelton D E et al., 1995 J Immunol (155) 1994-2004; Yang W—P et al., 1995 J Mol Biol (254) 392-403). Briefly, the variable regions of Ang2 antibody 536 were cloned into the TargetQuest modified pCES-1 vector (Dyax Corp, de Haard H J et al 1999 J Biol Chem (274) 18218-30). All CDR regions were targeted for randomization of each CDR residue by mutagenesis using NNK containing oligonucleotides. After the mutagenesis reaction, phage clones were interrogated for each position using phage ELISA to identify beneficial mutations (for methods see WO 2004/046306, WO 2003/03057134, and US 2003/0099647 A1, for general phage antibody refs., Marks J D et al., 1991 J Mol Biol (222) 581-597; Hoogenboom H R et al 1992 J Mol Biol (227) 381-388; Griffiths A D et al., 1993 EMBO J. (12) 725-734; Vaughan T P et al., 1996 Nat Biotechnol (14) 309-314). Clones with beneficial mutations were converted to full antibodies. Heavy chain clones were paired with light chain clones and resulting IgG was tested for neutralization activity. Top 22 clones were characterized further.\n\n\nA. Ab536 Fab Template Construction\n\n\nThe variable regions of 536 antibody were cloned into pCES-1 vector using standard molecular biology techniques (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3\nrd \nEdition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., 2001). The heavy chain variable and full length light chain fragments were generated by PCR using the following oligonucleotides:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHeavy chain reverse:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCCGCTGTGCCCCCAGAGGTGC (SEQ ID NO: 60)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHeavy chain forward:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nttttttccatggccgaggtccagctggtgcagtc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 61)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLight chain reverse:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTTTTTTGGCGCGCCTTATTAACACTCTCCCCTGTTGAAGCT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 62)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLight chain forward:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nttttttgtgcacttgacattgtgatgactcagtct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 63)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variable region of heavy chain was inserted between the restriction sites, NcoI and BstEII. The full length light chain was inserted between restriction sites, ApaLI and AscI. The resulting construct was used as a template for CDR randomization.\n\n\nB. CDR Mutations\n\n\nAntibody 536 as a Fab in vector pCES-1 was affinity matured by a step-wise site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides bearing NNK (N=ATCG; K=GT) codons for each of the CDR positions. The QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene #200518-5) was used following the manufacturer recommended protocol. To identify phages with enhanced binding to Ang2, phage ELISA performed with biotinylated human Ang2 protein coated at 2 ug/ml in PBS onto the 96 well Maxisorp plates (NUNC). Briefly, after blocking with 2% milk in PBS, overnight phage culture that were grown with helper phage was incubated and bound phages were detected with anti-M13 antibodies conjugated with HRP (Pharmacia). Luminescence signal was compared relative to parental 536 Fab, and clones with superior signal were selected for further analysis.\n\n\nC. IgG Conversion of Phage Fab\n\n\nAfter phage ELISA and sequence analysis, 95 clones each from light chain and heavy chain mutagenesis with enhanced binding against Ang2 were selected and converted into IgG. Briefly, the variable regions of each clone were PCR amplified using a pair of primers. Primer sequences for LC were CTG CTG CTG TGG CTG AGA GGT GCG CGC TGT GAT ATT GTG ATG ACT CAG TCT CCA CTC TCC (SEQ ID NO: 64) and AAA AAA CGT ACG TTT GAT CTC CAG CTT GGT CC (SEQ ID NO: 65). Primers for HC were TTTTTTTTGCGCGCTGTGAGGTCCAGCTGGTGCAGTC (SEQ ID NO: 66) and AAAAAAGGCACTA GAGACGGTGACCAGGGTTCC (SEQ ID NO: 67). After digesting with BssHII and BsiWI for LC, and BssHII and BsmBI for HC, the variable regions were inserted into pcDNA3 vectors containing VK1 leader sequence and constant sequence of human Kappa and human IgG1 using standard molecular biology techniques. Each ligation mixture was transformed into two 96well plates of XL10 gold competent cells (Stratagene), and the transformation mixture were grown overnight for plasmid prep the next day. Resulting DNA were paired with relative parental 536 LC or HC DNA, and transiently transfected into 293T cells in OPTI-MEM using Fugene6. After 7 days, the media from transfected cells were collected, and IgG concentration was quantified by Lance assay using anti-human IgG antibody (Fc specific) labeled with europium and anti-human IgG antibody labeled with APC (Perkin Elmer).\n\n\nD. Selection of IgG Clones\n\n\nConditioned media that contain IgG were tested in HTRF neutralizing assay for its inhibitory effect of Tie-2 interaction with either Ang1 or Ang2. From initial screening, 15LC clones and 11HC clones that showed improved activity were picked. The DNA of selected clones were prepared and confirmed by sequencing. Then the combination of each LC and HC mutants, along with 536 parental clone, were transfected into two 96 plates seeded with 293T cells. Conditioned media were collected, and analyzed for the IgG concentration and inhibitory effect in Tie2 neutralizing assay. From this combination, 22 clones that contain single mutation in each LC and HC were selected for further analysis.\n\n\nE. Expression and Purification of Human Affinity Matured Ang2 Antibodies in CHO Cells\n\n\nCS-9 cells used for transfection of the anti-Ang2 IgG expression plasmid(s) are a serum-free suspension CHO cell line. They were derived by gradually adapting DXB-11 CHO cells to grow in serum-free medium as described in Rasmussen et al, 1998 (Rasmussen, B., Davis, R., Thomas, J., Reddy, P. 1998. Isolation, characterization and recombinant protein expression in Veggie-CHO: A serum-free CHO host cell line. Cytotechnology. 28: 31-42). DXB-11 cells are a DHFR-deficient mutant derivative from CHO-K1 cells. (Chasin and Urlaub, 1983; Urlaub and Chasin. 1980. Isolation of Chinese hamster cell mutants deficient in dihydrofolate reductase activity. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77, 4216-4220.; Chasin L. A., Graf, L., Ellis, N., Lanzberg, M., Urlaub, G. 1982. Gene amplification in dihydro folate reductase deficient mutants. Schimke, R. T. (Ed.) Gene amplification; Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory: Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., p 161-166.). CHO-K1 is an epithelioid cell line originally isolated from the Chinese hamster ovary (Kao and Puck. Genetics of somatic mammalian cells. VII. Induction and isolation of nutritional mutants in Chinese hamster cells. \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. \n60: 1275-1281, 1968.).\n\n\nTo derive the CS-9 host cell line, DXB-11 cells were grown in media with gradual reduction in serum over 100 passages to obtain serum-free-adapted cells referred to as SF-CHO (Rasmussen et al, 1998). The SF-CHO cells were subsequently sub-cloned by limiting dilution cloning and individual clones were evaluated. The CS-9 clone was selected as the host cell line for expression of recombinant proteins and banked in serum-free medium. The bank was tested for adventious agents and sterility and found to be free of viral, mycoplamsa and microbial agents. The host cell line, CS-9, is a DHFR deficient CHO cell line auxotrophic for glycine, hypoxanthine and thymidine (GHT). The plasmids pDC323 and pDC324 each encode a portion of the DHFR cDNA and the 2 plasmids must complement each other to express a functional DHFR molecule by association of the 2 DHFR fragments in vivo.\n\n\nThe following twenty-two antibodies, each consisted of two heavy chains and 2 light (kappa or lambda) chains as designated in the following Table 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody Heavy\n \nAntibody Light\n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody*\n \nChain\n \nChain\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nH6L7\n \nH6 HC\n \nL7 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH5L7\n \nH5 HC\n \nL7 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH4L13\n \nH4 HC\n \nL13 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH11L7\n \nH11 HC\n \nL7 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH10L7\n \nH10 HC\n \nL7 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH4L7\n \nH4 HC\n \nL7 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH5L6\n \nH5 HC\n \nL6 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH2L7\n \nH2 HC\n \nL7 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH5L8\n \nH5 HC\n \nL8 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH6L8\n \nH6 HC\n \nL8 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH3L7\n \nH3 HC\n \nL7 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH5L4\n \nH5 HC\n \nL4 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH4L12\n \nH4 HC\n \nL12 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH6L6\n \nH6 HC\n \nL6 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH4L2\n \nH4 HC\n \nL2 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH4L6\n \nH4 HC\n \nL6 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH4L4\n \nH4 HC\n \nL4 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH5L11\n \nH5 HC\n \nL11 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH5L1\n \nH5 HC\n \nL1 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH4L11\n \nH4 HC\n \nL11 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH5L12\n \nH5 HC\n \nL12 LC\n \n \n \n \n \nH5L9\n \nH5 HC\n \nL9 LC\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n*Tested for binding to hAng-2, mAng-2, and hAng-1 as described herein.\n \n \n \n \n \n\nTables 3 and 4 set forth the sequences and SEQ ID NOs. of the heavy and light (kappa and lambda) chains of the 22 anti-Ang-1 and/or anti-Ang-2 antibodies converted from phage to full length IgG1 antibodies.

Neutralization ELISA and BIAcore) were developed to assess direct antibody binding to Ang-2 and related family members (for example, Ang-1), and the effect of antibodies on the Ang-2:Tie2 interaction. These in vitro and cell-based assays are described as follows.\n\n\nA. Affinity ELISA\n\n\nFor the initial screening of candidate anti-Ang-2 antibodies, purified human Ang-2 (R and D Systems, Inc; catalog number 623-AN; Ang-2 is provided as a mixture of 2 truncated versions) or murine Ang-2 polypeptide (prepared as described above) were used. For confirmatory binding assays, human Ang-2 was obtained from conditioned media of human 293T cells transfected with full length human Ang-2 DNA and cultured in serum free DMEM containing about 50 micrograms per ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA).\n\n\nUsing microtiter plates, approximately 100 microliters per well of Ang-2 was added to each well and the plates were incubated about 2 hours, after which the plates were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing about 0.1 percent Tween-20 four times. The wells were then blocked using about 250 microliters per well of about 5 percent BSA in PBS, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for about 2 hours. After incubation, excess blocking solution was discarded, and about 100 microliters of candidate anti-Ang-2 antibody was added to each well in a dilution series starting at a concentration of about 40 nanomolar and then serially diluting 4-fold in PBS containing about 1 percent BSA. The plates were then incubated overnight at room temperature. After incubation, plates were washed with PBS containing about 0.1 percent Tween-20. Washing was repeated four additional times, after which about 100 microliters per well of goat anti-human IgG(Fc)-HRP (Pierce Chemical Co., catalog #31416) previously diluted 1:5000 in PBS containing 1 percent BSA (bovine serum albumin) was added. Plates were incubated approximately 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were then washed five times in PBS containing about 0.1 percent Tween-20, after which about 100 microliters per well of TMB (3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine Liquid Substrate System; Sigma chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo., catalog number T8665) substrate was added and plates were incubated about 5-15 minutes until blue color developed. Absorbance was then read in a spectrophotomer at about 370 nm.\n\n\nB. Neutralization ELISA\n\n\nMicrotiter plates to which human Ang-2 polypeptide was bound were prepared as described for the Affinity ELISA. Candidate anti-Ang-2 antibodies were prepared in serial dilutions as described for the Affinity ELISA above in a solution of PBS containing about 1 percent BSA and about 1 nM Tie2 (provided as a Tie2-Fc molecule where the Tie2 portion contains only the soluble extracellular portion of the molecule; R and D Systems, catalog number 313-TI). After about 100 microliters of the antibody/Tie2 solution was added to each well, the plates were incubated overnight at room temperature, and then washed five times in PBS containing about 0.1 percent Tween-20. After washing, about 100 microliters per well of anti-Tie2 antibody (Pharmingen Inc., catalog #557039) was added to a final concentration of about 1 microgram per ml and the plates were incubated about 1 hour at room temperature then washed five time in PBS containing about 0.1 percent Tween-20. Next, about 100 microliters per well of goat anti-mouse-IgG-HRP (Pierce Chemical CO., catalog #31432) was added at a dilution of 1:10,000 in PBS containing about 1 percent BSA. Plates were incubated at room temperature for about 1 hour, after which they were washed five times with PBS containing about 0.1 percent Tween-20. About 100 microliters per well of TMB substrate (described above) was then added and color was allowed to develop. Absorbance was then read in a spectrophotomer at 370 nm.\n\n\nC. Affinity BIAcore\n\n\nAn affinity analysis of each candidate Ang-2 antibody was performed on a BIAcore®2000 (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) with PBS and 0.005 percent P20 surfactant (BIAcore, Inc.) as running buffer. Recombinant Protein G (Repligen, Needham, Mass.) was immobilized to a research grade CM5 sensor chip (Biacore, Inc.) via primary amine groups using the Amine Coupling Kit (Biacore, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol.\n\n\nBinding assays were carried out by first attaching about 100 Ru of each candidate anti-Ang-2 antibody to the immobilized Protein G, after which various concentrations (0-100 nM) of huAng-2 or mAng-2 were then injected over the bound antibody surface at a flow rate of about 50 ul/min for about 3 minutes. Antibody binding kinetics including k\na \n(association rate constant), k\nd \n(dissociation rate constant) and K\nD \n(dissociation equilibrium constant) were determined using the BIA evaluation 3.1 computer program (BIAcore, Inc.). Lower dissociation equilibrium constants indicated greater affinity of the antibody for Ang-2.\n\n\nAll twenty two of the antibodies and a negative control IgG1 (referred to as RDB1) were tested using affinity and neutralization ELISA (as described in Example 3 above) as well as the BIAcore neutralization assay to determine their affinity, neutralization, and specificity capabilities. The results are set forth below (Table 2) and were calculated using standard procedures. Three antibodies, H6L7, H4L4 and H4L11 were evaluated for IC50 neutralizing concentrations against human and murine Ang-1 and Ang-2., using the ELISA analysis described above. All three antibodies were shown to crossreact with mouse, rabbit, and cynomolgus monkey Ang1 and Ang2, exhibiting similar potencies across angiopoietin orthologs. The results are reported in the following Table 3.\n\n\nD. HTRF hAng-1 and hAng-2 Antibody IC50s and IC90s\n\n\nEqual volume of 1.6 nM Streptavidin-Europium (SA-EU) and 8 nM Biotinylated angiopoietin 2 (in-house) or Biotinylated agiopoietin 1 (R&D Cat# BAF923) were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes in the dark with rotation in a 15 ml conical tube (Fisher 352096). Then 50 ul of the above SA-EU/Biotinylated Ang 2(1) mixture was added to each well on a Mixing Plate (Costar 3356). To the Mixing Plate, 50 ul of serial diluted Ang1 and Ang2 antibody at 4× final concentrations were added to each well. The Mixing Plate was then incubated at room temperature for 1 hour on a shaker in the dark. On an Assay Plate (Costar 3356), 20 ul of 10 nM huTie-2-Fc-APC (Prozyme Custom Lot# DF99-048) was added to each well. Then 20 ul of the mixture from each well on the Mixing Plate was transferred to each well on the Assay Plate. The Assay Plate was incubated at room temperature for 2 hours in the dark with rotation. Then the Assay Plate was read on RUBYstar plate reader (BMG labtechnologies, INC). All the reagents in the assay were diluted with HTRF buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20). IC50 and IC90 were calculated with GRAFIT 5.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiochemical Potency of Antibodies Against hAng1 and hAng2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC50\n\n\nIC90 \n\n\n \n\n\nIC50\n\n\nIC90\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhAng1\n\n\nhAng1\n\n\n \n\n\nhAng2\n\n\nhAng2\n\n\nIC90/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nIC90/IC50\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nIC50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH6L7\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0.49\n\n\n8.0\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH5L7\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n0.42\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n0.23\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4L13\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n11\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH11L7\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n8.1\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0.20\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH10L7\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n14\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4L7\n\n\n0.23\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0.22\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH5L6\n\n\n0.32\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n11\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n0.23\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH2L7\n\n\n0.33\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n11\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0.20\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH5L8\n\n\n0.37\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH6L8\n\n\n0.57\n\n\n7.7\n\n\n13\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH3L7\n\n\n0.58\n\n\n7.1\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0.23\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH5L4\n\n\n0.60\n\n\n11\n\n\n19\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4L12\n\n\n0.63\n\n\n8.7\n\n\n14\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH6L6\n\n\n0.66\n\n\n10\n\n\n16\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0.20\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4L2\n\n\n0.66\n\n\n6.8\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4L6\n\n\n0.74\n\n\n15\n\n\n20\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0.20\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4L4\n\n\n0.87\n\n\n8.2\n\n\n9.4\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0.16\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH5L11\n\n\n0.97\n\n\n18\n\n\n18\n\n\n0.08\n\n\n0.25\n\n\n3.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH5L1\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n24\n\n\n15\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n0.29\n\n\n4.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAMG\n 386*\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n106\n\n\n41\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n0.13\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAMG\n 386*\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n278\n\n\n71\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n4.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4L11\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n107\n\n\n15\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n0.17\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nH5L12\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n159\n\n\n11\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n0.31\n\n\n4.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH5L9\n\n\n18\n\n\n181\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n1.57\n\n\n8.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Peptibody.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nMolecular Characterization of Angiopoietin Antibodies\n\n\nFour of the fully human IgG2 antibodies (Ab536, H4L4, H6L7, and H4L11) with potent hAng2 inhibitory activity and a range of hAng1 inhibitory activities were selected for further studies.

For each study group, mice were injected subcutaneously on the right flank with 2×10\n6 \ncells in Matrigel™. Ten animals with average tumor volume of 300 mm3 were randomly assigned to each experimental group. The animals were injected IP twice per week, beginning on day 17 post implantation, with 300 μg of the angiopoietin-targeted antibodies or isotype control antibody. \nAMG\n 386 at the optimum biological dose (OBD) in this model of 14 μg (SC) twice weekly was included as a positive control and antibody 536LC1 was included at 300 μg twice weekly. Body weight and tumor size were measured twice weekly.\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 1\n, all three antibodies significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to treatment with an isotype control antibody (p<0.0001). Treatment with H6L7 and H4L4, resulted in significantly greater inhibition of tumor growth compared to 536LC1. Data represents mean±SEM. At the end of the experiment, tumors were harvested, fixed in zinc-formalin and paraffin embedded. Histological sections of tumor were stained with hematoxylin. The viable tumor fraction was then estimated, using RGB thresholding and automated pixel counting, from a 1× digital image of the entire tumor cross-section. Viable tumor burden was calculated as the viable fraction multiplied by the terminal tumor weight. Data represents mean±SEM (n=10). \nFIG. 2\n demonstrates that antibodies H6L7, H4L4 and H4L11 also significantly reduced tumor burden relative to control (p<0.0001), suggesting that the volume-based tumor measurements underestimated the anti-tumor effect of the antibodies.\n\n\nHistopathology was performed on tumors and normal tissues from the mice in the study shown in \nFIGS. 1 and 2\n. Treatment of xenograft-bearing nude mice with the angiopoietin inhibitors (\nAMG\n 386, 536LC1, H4L4, H4L11, or H6L7) did not elicit adverse anatomic effects in non-target tissues.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nEffect of Anti-Ang-1 and/or Ang-2 Antibodies on Endothelial cell Proliferation\n\n\nIn a parallel experiment, animals with approximately 400 mm\n3 \ntumors were treated with 536LC1 (AKA LC1), H4L11, H4L4, H6L7, \nAMG\n 386 or control IgG2 for 72 hrs. Seventeen hours prior to sacrifice, animals were implanted with osmotic minipumps containing 3 mg/mL BrdU. Upon sacrifice, endothelial cells were isolated from the Colo205 tumor-bearing mice and were analyzed by flow cytometry to assess proliferation. Dissociated cells were stained with anti-mouse CD45-FITC and CD31-PE antibodies, followed by fixation and staining with anti-BrdU-alexa647 antibodies. Data represents mean±SEM (n=5). As shown in \nFIG. 3\n, treatment with all antibodies significantly reduced the percentage of BrdU positive cells (p<0.002 compared to IgG2 control). These data are consistent with an anti-angiogenic therapeutic mechanism whereby the angiopoietin-targeted antibodies inhibit tumor endothelial cell proliferation in vivo.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nDose Titration of H4L4 in Colo205 Tumor Xenografts\n\n\nThe antibody H4L4 was selected for more extensive analysis exploring the dose dependency of H4L4-mediated tumor growth inhibition. The animals were injected with H4L4 IP twice-weekly beginning on \nday\n 14 at doses ranging from 3 μg to 300 μg. \nAMG\n 386 at the optimum biological dose of 14 μg (SC) twice weekly was included as a positive control. As shown in \nFIG. 4\n, all doses of H4L4 significantly inhibited tumor growth and viable tumor burden (p<0.0001), with an OBD of ˜30 μg in the viable tumor burden analysis (\nFIG. 5\n.).\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nEffect of H4L4 on Colo205 Tumor Endothelial Cell Proliferation In Vivo\n\n\nIn a parallel experiment, Colo205 tumor-bearing mice with tumors of approximately 450 mm\n3 \nwere treated with a single dose of H4L4, \nAMG\n 386 or control IgG2 for 72 hours and then analyzed as in \nFIG. 3\n. As shown in \nFIG. 6\n, treatment with H4L4 significantly inhibited endothelial cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, with an OBD of 30 μg.\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nPharmacokinetics of H4L4, H6L7, H4L11, and 536LC1 in Mice, Rats and Cynomologus monkey\n\n\nThe pharmacokinetics (PK) of H4L4, H6L7, H4L11, and 536LC1 have been characterized in CD-1 mice after single-dose intravenous (IV) or intraperitoneal (IP) administration. The PK of H4L4 and H6L7 was also characterized in Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys after single-dose IV administration.\n\n\nAfter single-dose IV or IP administration to mice, H4L4 exposure appeared to increase approximately dose-proportionally in the dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg (Table 4). The overall mean terminal half-life (t\n1/2,z\n), clearance (CL), and volume of distribution at steady-state (V\nss\n) was 207 hrs, 0.43 mL/hr/kg, and 128 mL/kg, respectively. The bioavailability (% F) after IP administration was greater than 90% for all dose groups. In contrast, H6L7, H4L11, and 536LC1 exhibited nonlinear PK in mice with exposure increasing greater than dose proportionally from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg. The exposure of H6L7 in rats and monkeys also increased greater than dose-proportionally after a single IV dose of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg.\n\n\nIn contrast to its linear PK profile in mice, H4L4 exhibited nonlinear rat and monkey PK. The mean residence time (MRT) in rats ranged from 57 to 217 hours; the CL ranged from 0.3 to 1.4 mL/hr/kg; the V\nss \nranged from 57 to 68 mL/kg. In monkeys, the MRT ranged from 40 to 163 hours; the CL ranged from 0.4 to 1.9 mL/hr/kg; the V\nss \nranged from 49 to 75 mL/kg.\n\n\nThe PK of H4L4 was also assessed in nude mice bearing Colo205 tumor xenografts in a pharmacology study at 3, 10, 30, 100 or 300 μg dose/mouse, administered IP twice weekly for 4 weeks. Serum H4L4 exposure increased approximately dose proportionally as assessed by serum trough concentrations. The PK of H4L4 in nude mice was similar to that observed in CD-1 mice, and PK did not appear to change over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPK Parameters of H4L4 and H6L7 in Preclinical Species\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMouse\n\n\nRat\n\n\nMonkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.1\n\n\n1\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n1\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n1\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH4L4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDose (mg/kg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n1/2,z \n(hr)\n\n\n196\n\n\n180\n\n\n244\n\n\n42.5\n\n\n66.7\n\n\n213\n\n\n36.2\n\n\n35.6\n\n\n80.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRT (hr)\n\n\n259\n\n\n273\n\n\n420\n\n\n57.4\n\n\n107\n\n\n217\n\n\n40.1\n\n\n52.0\n\n\n163\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCL (mL/hr/kg)\n\n\n0.666\n\n\n0.386\n\n\n0.249\n\n\n1.39\n\n\n0.552\n\n\n0.319\n\n\n1.89\n\n\n0.933\n\n\n0.414\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nss \n(mL/kg)\n\n\n173\n\n\n105\n\n\n105\n\n\n66.4\n\n\n57.0\n\n\n68.5\n\n\n74.9\n\n\n48.6\n\n\n67.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n0 \n(mL/kg)\n\n\n71.0\n\n\n46.6\n\n\n46.7\n\n\n43.3\n\n\n34.5\n\n\n36.1\n\n\n48.2\n\n\n40.8\n\n\n44.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH6L7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDose (mg/kg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n1/2,z \n(hr)\n\n\n8.27\n\n\n99.0\n\n\n82.8\n\n\n9.43\n\n\n25.8\n\n\n92.9\n\n\n10.4\n\n\n32.6\n\n\n65.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRT (hr)\n\n\n11.6\n\n\n54.3\n\n\n263\n\n\n13.2\n\n\n41.2\n\n\n158\n\n\n15.1\n\n\n51.8\n\n\n158\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCL (mL/hr/kg)\n\n\n19.4\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n0.349\n\n\n3.31\n\n\n1.02\n\n\n0.331\n\n\n2.81\n\n\n0.824\n\n\n0.358\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nss \n(mL/kg)\n\n\n224\n\n\n109\n\n\n91.8\n\n\n43.3\n\n\n41.3\n\n\n51.9\n\n\n41.3\n\n\n42.2\n\n\n55.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n0 \n(mL/kg)\n\n\n90.9\n\n\n58.4\n\n\n56.6\n\n\n35.4\n\n\n35.3\n\n\n38.1\n\n\n40.0\n\n\n37.7\n\n\n43.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nAngiopoietin-1 Neutralization Mediates Context-Dependent Suppression of Angiogenesis and Tumor Growth\n\n\nWhile Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) is a key mediator of postnatal angiogenesis, the role of Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) in this setting is less clear. To investigate the postnatal function of Ang1, we have developed potent and selective peptibodies (peptide-Fc fusion proteins) that inhibit the interaction between Ang1 and its receptor, Tie2. We show that selective Ang1 antagonism has no independent effect in models of angiogenesis-associated diseases (cancer and diabetic retinopathy), although it can induce ovarian atrophy in normal juvenile rats and inhibit ovarian follicular angiogenesis in a hormone-induced ovulation model. Surprisingly, the activity of Ang1 inhibitors appears to be unmasked in some disease models when combined with Ang2 inhibitors. Dual inhibition of Ang1 and Ang2 cooperatively suppresses ovarian follicular angiogenesis and tumor xenograft growth; however, Ang1 inhibition fails to augment the activity of Ang2 inhibition in suppressing tumor endothelial cell proliferation, corneal angiogenesis, and oxygen-induced retinal angiogenesis. In no case was Ang1 inhibition shown to 1) confer superior activity to that of Ang2 inhibition or dual Ang1/Ang2 inhibition or 2) antagonize the effects of Ang2 inhibition. These results imply that Ang1 plays a context-dependent role in promoting postnatal angiogenesis and angiogenesis-associated pathology.\n\n\nAng1 plays an important role in developmental angiogenesis, but its function in postnatal neovascularization is less clear. Ang1 has been shown to mediate both pro- and anti-angiogenic effects in various postnatal settings. To investigate the function of Ang1 by inhibiting endogenous Ang1. To that end, we have developed Ang1-neutralizing peptibodies and tested them alone or in combination with Ang2 inhibitors in preclinical models of postnatal angiogenesis.\n\n\nWe generated Ang1-neutralizing peptibodies to investigate the functional role of Ang1 in angiogenesis. Phage display peptide libraries were panned to identify peptides that bound Ang1, but not Ang2. The resulting clones were converted into peptibodies by expressing the peptides in \nE. coli \nas fusions to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Peptibodies were then screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assays for their ability to neutralize the interaction between Tie2 and angiopoietins. One of these peptibodies was affinity-matured to increase its ability to antagonize Ang1, and a resultant peptibody, mL4-3, was chosen for the studies herein. mL4-3 exhibited similar potency against several Ang1 orthologs, and it displayed >40,000-fold selectivity over Ang2 (Tables 10 and 11). Also shown in Table 10 are two previously described peptibodies: AMG 386 [also known as 2xCon4 (C)] and L1-7(N). L1-7(N) is a very potent and selective Ang2 inhibitor, and \nAMG\n 386 is a dual inhibitor of Ang1 and Ang2. The pharmacokinetic profiles of mL4-3 in rodents were acceptable for daily to weekly s.c. dosing (Table 3).\n\n\nmL4-3 can be used as a reagent for interrogating Ang1 function in vivo. To assess whether mL4-3 was capable of selectively sequestering Ang1 in vivo, mL4-3, L1-7(N), and Fc were administered s.c. to mice, followed by an i.v. challenge with recombinant Ang1. Ang1 induced Tie2 phosphorylation in mouse lung endothelium (approximately 5-fold), an effect that could be prevented by mL4-3, but not by L1-7(N) or Fc (\nFIG. 7\n).\n\n\nNext, we wanted to determine whether mL4-3 could neutralize endogenous Ang1 in a setting in which Ang1 was known to play a physiologically relevant role. Developmental genetic knockout studies have shown that Ang1 deletion reduces cardiac size and endocardial folding in embryos. In an attempt to replicate this phenotype pharmacologically, mL4-3 was administered to pregnant mice in early and middle gestation. Embryos were harvested at embryonic day 12.5, the time at which lethality was observed in Ang1-null mouse embryos. Pharmacokinetic assessment of mouse embryo lysates demonstrated a mean mL4-3 trough level of 3.0 μg/g of tissue, confirming that mL4-3 was capable of crossing the placenta. Histological analysis revealed reduced cardiac size and trabeculation, similar to, but less dramatic than that observed in Ang1-null embryos (\nFIG. 8\n). The less pronounced phenotype of the mL4-3 treated embryos may be a consequence of suboptimal embryonic mL4-3 exposures and incomplete Ang1 sequestration. Nonetheless, mL4-3 clearly induces embryonic cardiac defects that phenocopy those of Ang1 genetic knockout mice, confirming the utility of mL4-3 as a reagent for investigating Ang1 function in vivo.\n\n\nAng1 antagonism augments Ang2 antagonism in suppressing tumor growth. In a previous report, we demonstrated that systemically administered L1-7(N) and \nAMG\n 386 were capable of inhibiting the growth of Colo205 tumor xenografts implanted into nude mice. In that study, the antitumor effects of \nAMG\n 386 were modestly superior to those of L1-7(N) (P=0.006). To confirm that dual Ang1/Ang2 inhibition confers better tumor growth suppression than Ang2 inhibition alone, a similar experiment was performed, but this time groups treated with mL4-3 or a combination of mL4-3 and L1-7(N) were also tested (\nFIG. 9\n). The \nAMG\n 386 treatment group and the mL4-3/L1-7(N) combination treatment group showed comparable antitumor efficacy; moreover, both groups exhibited efficacy superior to that mediated by either L1-7(N) or mL4-3 alone. In fact, mL4-3 had no discernable single-agent effect on tumor growth, implying that combining Ang2 antagonism with Ang1 antagonism may have unmasked the antitumor effect of Ang1 inhibition. Additional replicates of these experiments confirmed that \nAMG\n 386 and the mL4-3/L1-7(N) combination mediated greater tumor growth suppression than L1-7(N) alone (data not shown). However, in a minority of instances, these differences did not reach statistical significance, perhaps reflecting the subtle nature of the incremental advantage conferred by dual Ang1/Ang2 inhibition over selective Ang2 inhibition. Selective Ang1 inhibition had no antitumor effect on its own in any of the experiments in which it was tested (\nFIG. 9\n and data not shown).\n\n\nAng2 antagonism, but not Ang1 antagonism, inhibits tumor endothelial cell proliferation, corneal angiogenesis, and retinal angiogenesis. We previously showed that dual Ang1/Ang2 inhibition was capable of suppressing Colo205 tumor endothelial cell proliferation in vivo. To investigate whether this effect was conferred through Ang1 inhibition, Ang2 inhibition, or a combination of the two, Colo205 tumor-bearing mice were treated with mL4-3, L1-7(N), mL4-3/L1-7(N), or \nAMG\n 386. As with the tumor volume readout described in the previous section, mL4-3 had no single-agent effect on tumor endothelial cell proliferation, while L1-7(N) was inhibitory (\nFIG. 10A\n). Curiously, however, dual Ang1/Ang2 inhibition conferred no greater effect on endothelial cell proliferation than Ang2 inhibition alone (\nFIG. 10A\n), an observation that has been repeatedly reproduced (data not shown) and stands in contrast to the apparently cooperative effects of combined Ang1/Ang2 inhibition on Colo205 tumor growth. This dissimilarity implies that repression of endothelial cell proliferation is only one component underlying the tumor growth inhibition mediated by angiopoietin antagonism.\n\n\nThese agents were next tested in two models of ocular angiogenesis, one involving the cornea and the other involving the retina. The cornea is normally avascular, but pathological angiogenesis can occur in the cornea secondary to conditions such as keratitis and corneal transplant rejection. VEGF- and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced models of corneal angiogenesis were used to test the roles of Ang1 and Ang2 antagonism in neovessel formation. As observed with endothelial cell proliferation, corneal angiogenesis appeared to be dependent on Ang2, but not on Ang1 (\nFIGS. 10B and 10C\n). The same conclusion could be drawn from evaluation of these angiopoietin-antagonizing peptibodies in a Tie2-dependent retinal model of angiogenesis in which neovascularization was induced by changes in ambient oxygen tension (\nFIG. 10D\n). Thus, in three preclinical settings (endothelial cell proliferation, corneal angiogenesis, and retinal angiogenesis), Ang2 inhibition dramatically suppressed neovessel formation, while Ang1 inhibition had no effect alone or in combination with Ang2 inhibition.\n\n\nSelective inhibition of Ang1 or Ang2 induces ovarian atrophy, but not epiphyseal plate thickening. To assess the effects of angiopoietin inhibition in normal animals, rats were treated systemically with mL4-3, L1-7(N), or \nAMG\n 386 for one month. \nAMG\n 386, like VEGF antagonists, has been observed to induce epiphyseal plate thickening and ovarian atrophy, effects considered to be mechanism-based consequences of antiangiogenic therapy. In the present study, \nAMG\n 386 provoked epiphyseal plate thickening in all treated animals, while, remarkably, L1-7(N) and mL4-3 failed to alter epiphyseal morphology in any rats (Table 13). Thus, induction of epiphyseal plate thickening appears to require inhibition of both Ang1 and Ang2. In striking contrast, all three peptibodies produced ovarian atrophy at similar incidence rates, indicating that selective inhibition of Ang1 or Ang2 is sufficient to induce ovarian atrophy.\n\n\nAng1 and Ang2 Inhibitors Cooperatively Suppress Ovarian Follicular Angiogenesis. To better understand the effects of angiopoietin inhibition on the ovary, we employed a hormone-induced model of ovarian follicular angiogenesis that allowed controlled assessment of neovascularization in mice that had never previously ovulated. In this model, pregnant mare serum (PMS) and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) were used to induce rapid, synchronized ovulation in multiple follicles (\nFIG. 11\n). Mice were treated systemically with Fc control, mL4-3, L1-7(N), or an mL4-3/L1-7(N) combination to determine the effects of these agents on neovessel formation in transforming Graafian follicles. Two identically-designed replicates of this experiment were performed on different days, and remarkably, both yielded almost identical activity profiles with respect to percentage inhibition of blood vessel area (replicate 1, replicate 2): L1-7(N) (8%, 11%), mL4-3 (15%, 14%), mL4-3/L1-7(N) (24%, 26%). All single-agent and combination peptibody groups, with the exception of the L1-7(N) group in \nExperiment\n 1, mediated statistically significant inhibition of angiogenesis relative to the Fc control (P<0.05) (\nFIG. 11\n). Thus, both inhibition of ovarian angiogenesis and induction of ovarian atrophy could be elicited by inhibiting Ang1, Ang2, or both, consistent with the notion that the observed ovarian atrophy was a consequence of failed neovessel development.\n\n\nWe demonstrate that Ang1 inhibition plays a context-dependent role in the suppression of angiogenesis in preclinical disease models and in normal animals. In utero, pharmacologic Ang1 inhibition partially phenocopied the genetic ablation of Ang1, consistent with the important role of Ang1 in developmental angiogenesis. Postnatally, selective Ang1 antagonism inhibited ovarian angiogenesis and induced ovarian atrophy, effects that could also be achieved by inhibiting Ang2 alone or Ang1 plus Ang2 together. However, in postnatal disease models, Ang1 inhibition had little effect on its own, although its biological activity appeared to be unmasked in some settings when combined with Ang2 suppression. The mechanism underlying the differential dependency on Ang1 in these settings remains to be determined\n\n\nThe ovary, by virtue of its role in reproductive cycling, is one of the few organs that undergoes normal angiogenesis in adults. Based on the ovarian expression patterns of Ang1 and Ang2 in hormone-induced ovulating rats, it has been proposed that Ang2 plays an early role in vessel invasion, and Ang1 plays a later role to mature the newly-formed vessels. Under this hypothesis, Ang2 and Ang1 perform opposing functions, where Ang2 initially displaces Ang1 from Tie2, resulting in vessel destabilization and angiogenesis. This state of plasticity is subsequently reversed when Ang1 ousts Ang2 from the receptor to re-establish vascular quiescence and stability. In conflict with this model, the data from the current study imply that Ang1 and Ang2 both play pro-angiogenic roles in the ovary.\n\n\nIn the Colo205 tumor xenograft model, antagonism of Ang1 and Ang2 mediated greater tumor suppression than was achieved by inhibiting Ang1 or Ang2 individually, indicating that this model is dependent on both angiopoietins. However, in the same model, only Ang2 inhibition was capable of down-modulating tumor endothelial cell proliferation, suggesting that Ang1 is not involved in this function. What accounts for the different dependencies of these two endpoints on Ang1? One possibility is that Ang1 inhibition has a direct effect on tumor cells. This seems unlikely, however, given that \nAMG\n 386, a dual inhibitor of Ang1 and Ang2, has no effect on the in vitro growth of cultured Colo205 tumor cells. A second possibility is that Ang1 antagonism plays an anti-angiogenic role that is not conferred through inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, but instead through mechanisms that might impact functions such as endothelial cell migration or invasion. This explanation could be applicable if Ang1 and Ang2 mediated qualitatively or quantitatively different signals through Tie2, or if Ang1 signaled through additional receptors that were not responsive to Ang2. A third possibility is that Ang1 signals through Tie2 on non-endothelial cells, such as Tie2-expressing monocytes (TEMs). TEMs are recruited to tumors, where they cluster around neovessels. Selective ablation of TEMs in tumor-bearing mice suppresses tumor angiogenesis and inhibits tumor growth, and it has been postulated that TEMs promote tumor angiogenesis by providing paracrine signals that stimulate neovessels. Perhaps Ang1 stimulates TEMs to release pro-angiogenic cytokines other than the angiopoietins. In such a setting, inhibition of Ang1 could have an indirect anti-neovascular effect that might complement the direct anti-angiogenic effect of Ang2 suppression.\n\n\nIn contrast to the subtle and context-dependent effects of Ang1 inhibition, Ang2 inhibition frequently mediated effects that were equivalent or nearly equivalent to those conferred by combined antagonism of Ang1 and Ang2, implying that Ang2 may be the dominant angiopoietin involved in postnatal angiogenesis. Ang1 appears to be the dominant angiopoietin involved in prenatal angiogenesis, suggesting a shift in the dependency on these two factors around the time of birth. Our inhibitors do not antagonize Ang4, but the functional relevance of this factor is unclear, given its lung-restricted expression pattern.\n\n\nAng1 and Ang2 have been shown to play both similar and opposing functional roles in various in vitro and in vivo systems. The inability to draw consistent conclusions in this regard across multiple publications may be in part a consequence of the different conditions under which the question was examined. These differences include evaluation of 1) in vitro versus in vivo systems, 2) prenatal versus postnatal angiogenesis, 3) varying vascular beds, 4) pathological versus normal angiogenesis, and 5) gain-of-function versus loss-of-function experimental designs. This final difference may be particularly important, as the addition of exogenous factors to a model system may be a less physiologically relevant means to elucidate function than removal of endogenous factors. Perhaps the most informative published experiments in this regard are those in which Ang1 and Ang2 have been genetically deleted in the germline of rodents. These studies provide significant insight into the developmental roles of Ang1 and Ang2. However, it is more difficult to genetically examine the postnatal in vivo function of Ang1 and Ang2 without the availability of conditional knockout systems; the constitutive Ang1 knockout mouse dies in utero (as does the constitutive Ang2 knockout on some strain backgrounds), and the postnatal phenotype of surviving Ang2 knockout mice may be influenced by residual effects of developmental gene deletion. By using pharmacologic Ang1 and Ang2 inhibitors to examine the postnatal roles of Ang1 and Ang2 in vivo, we have circumvented these issues. The results of the current study imply that Ang1 and Ang2 do not functionally oppose one another in postnatal systems, and in some cases, they appear to act cooperatively.\n\n\nPathological angiogenesis is associated with altered angiopoietin levels in a number of diseases, including cancer, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and psoriasis. Angiopoietin-targeted interventions in these therapeutic indications may provide clinical benefit. The data presented herein suggest that, in some settings, combined inhibition of Ang1 and Ang2 may provide superior therapeutic efficacy to that mediated by targeting Ang2 alone.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nPhage display selection of Ang1-binding peptides. Three filamentous phage libraries, TN8-IX (5×10\n9 \nindependent transformants), TN12-I (1.4×10\n9 \nindependent transformants), and Linear (2.3×10\n9 \nindependent transformants) (Dyax Corp., Cambridge, Mass.), were used to select for Ang1-binding phage. After negative selection on empty streptavidin Dynabeads (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, Calif.) blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or beads loaded with biotinylated Ang2 (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.), remaining phage were incubated with beads loaded with biotinylated Ang1 (R&D Systems, Inc.). After extensive washing, the phage from each round of selection were eluted in a nonspecific manner using 100 mM triethylamine solution (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, Mo.). The eluted phage were amplified in \nE. coli \nstrain XL-1 Blue MRF′, purified by precipitation, and then used for the next round of selection.\n\n\nAfter three rounds of selection, individual phage clones were isolated and analyzed by phage ELISA and DNA sequencing. Briefly, Ang1 protein was coated on 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc brand, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester, N.Y.) and blocked with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20) containing 4% dry milk. Phage supernatants were incubated in the wells and bound phage were detected with an HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.). To check cross-reactivity to Ang2 or streptavidin, control plates were set up in a similar fashion. ELISA results and DNA sequencing data were used as criteria for selecting peptide sequences to express in a peptibody format. Peptibodies were evaluated in an HTRF assay, and several were chosen for affinity maturation.\n\n\nPeptide affinity maturation was performed by generating and panning nucleotide-doped phage display libraries. Libraries with over 1×10\n9 \nindependent transformants were obtained. These focused libraries were panned by a procedure similar to that used for panning the primary libraries.\n\n\nPeptibody expression and purification. Peptibody mL4-3 was expressed and purified as described in Oliner, J., et al. 2004., \nCancer Cell \n6:507-516.

Europium-labeled streptavidin (LANCE reagent, PerkinElmer Inc., Boston, Mass.) and biotinylated human Ang1 (R&D Systems, Inc.) or Ang2 were mixed in HTRF buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.05\n% Tween\n 20, 0.1% BSA) and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 minutes on a shaker. Equal volumes of the above mixture and serially diluted peptibodies or Fc were mixed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Equal volumes of allophycocyanin-conjugated Tie2-Fc (Tie2-APC) (Prozyme, San Leandro, Calif.) and the above mixture were mixed and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The final concentrations of reagents in the assay were 4 nM europium-streptavidin, 2 nM biotinylated Ang1 or Ang2, and 5 nM Tie2-APC. Peptibodies were serially diluted from 10,000 nM to 0.5 nM or 100 nM to 0.005 nM to generate full titration curves. Neutralization of angiopoietin:Tie2 interaction was measured by the diminishing energy transfer between APC and europium and was quantified using a Rubystar plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenberg, Germany). The potency of angipoietin/Tie2 neutralization was determined by calculating the percentage inhibition of each peptibody dilution in reference to the maximum (no angiopoietin in the assay mixture) and minimum inhibition (no peptibody in the assay mixture) controls. IC\n50 \nvalues were calculated by plotting percentage inhibition using XLfit4, where fit=A+((B−A)/(1+((C/X)^D))) (IDBS, Guildford, UK).\n\n\nAngiopoietin: Tie2 neutralization ELISA. Ninety-six-well microtiter plates were coated with a panel of recombinant angiopoietins in 293T cell conditioned media (DMEM/50 ug/ml BSA) at 37° C. for 1 hour. The conditioned media were used at angiopoietin concentrations that conferred 70% of maximally achievable binding to 1 nM hTie2-Fc (Recombinant hTie2-Fc, Catalog #313-TI, R&D Systems Inc.). Plates were washed three times with PBS/0.1% Tween-20 and then block for 2 hours at room temperature with PBS/5% BSA. The blocking solution was removed without washing the plates. mL4-3 or Fc serially diluted in a solution of 1 nM Tie2-Fc/1% BSA/PBS was added to the angiopoietin-coated plates, which were incubated overnight at room temperature and then washed with PBS/1% Tween-20. A mouse-derived anti-Tie2 antibody (Catalog #557039, BD Pharmingen Inc., San Jose, Calif.) was added to each well at a final concentration of 1 ug/ml and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were then washed 3 times with PBS/0.1% Tween-20. Goat anti-mouse-IgG-HRP (Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, Catalog #31432, Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) was added at a dilution of 1:10,000 in PBS/1% BSA to each well and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBS/0.1% Tween-20 before TMB substrate (SureBlue Reserve TMB, Catalog#53-00002, KPL, Gaithersburg, Md.) was added and optical density at 650 nM was measured on a plate reader (SpectraMax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.). The degree of angiopoietin:Tie2 neutralization (IC\n50\n) was determined by comparison against a Tie2 standard curve (the binding activity of serially diluted Tie2 in the absence of competitor) using XLfit.\n\n\nAnimal studies. All procedures were approved by the Amgen Animal Care and Use Committee and met Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care standards.\n\n\nPharmacokinetic assessment. Three CD-1 mice received a single s.c. injection of 3.2 mg/kg of mL4-3, and two Sprague-Dawley rats received a single i.v. injection of 10 mg/kg of mL4-3. Blood samples were collected up to 274 hours from the mice and 336 hours from the rats for serum pharmacokinetic assessment. mL4-3 concentrations in serum samples from each species were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Polystyrene 96-well plates were coated with human Ang1, followed by incubation with mL4-3-containing serum samples. After washing away any unbound substances, a horseradish peroxidase-labeled monoclonal mouse anti-IgG1 antibody was added to the wells. Following a wash step to remove any unbound monoclonal antibody, TMB-peroxidase substrate was added to the wells. The optical density units measured at 450-650 nm were converted to concentrations by comparing to a concurrently analyzed standard curve.\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis of the individual serum concentration-time data (WinNonlin Professional, version 3.3; Pharsight Corp, Mountain View, Calif.). Terminal phase half-life (t\n1/2\n) was calculated as t\n1/2\n=ln(2)/λ\nz\n, in which λ\nz \nis the first-order terminal phase elimination rate constant estimated via linear regression of the terminal log-linear decay phase. Area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC\n0-last\n) was estimated by the linear/log trapezoidal method from \ntime\n 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (C\nlast\n). AUC\n0-inf \nwas estimated from \ntime\n 0 to infinity as AUC\n0-inf\n=AUC\n0-last \nC\nlast\n/λ\nz\n. AUC\n0-inf \nvalues were normalized to a 1 mg/kg dose.\n\n\nBecause the pharmacokinetic properties of mL4-3, L1-7, and \nAMG\n 386 were dissimilar, the dose levels and schedules of each agent were chosen, where possible, to achieve equimolar serum steady-state C\nmin \nconcentrations within pharmacology studies.\n\n\nAdministration of mL4-3 to pregnant mice. Two groups of six 129/SV female mice were impregnated by C57BL/6 males. Pregnant females were dosed with 300 mg/kg Fc control or mL4-3 by s.c. administration on gestational days E4.5, E7.5 and E11.5. Conceptuses (embryos and placentae) were removed on day E12.5, evaluated for gross abnormalities, and fixed by immersion in IHC-zinc (mL4-3-treated, n=10; Fc control-treated, n=10) or Bouin's solution (mL4-3-treated, n=5; Fc control-treated, n=6). Paraffin-embedded tissues were step-sectioned at 50-μm intervals through the heart (embryos in both longitudinal and transverse orientation) and the middle of the placenta. Serial sections from each interval were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or stained with a conventional indirect immunohistochemistry procedure using polyclonal anti-CD31 (rat anti-mouse monoclonal MEC 13.3, BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif.) to specifically label blood vessels. Criteria for scoring changes were established by evaluating sections with a foreknowledge of the treatment. Subsequently, lesion severity was graded rapidly using a tiered scale (minimal, mild, moderate, or marked) and a blinded analytical paradigm. These ordinal pathology data were analyzed using the Chi-square test contained in the JMP statistical software package (v.5.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, N.C.). An embryo from each pregnant mother collected on day E12.5 was analyzed by ELISA using human Ang1 as a capture reagent and horseradish peroxidase-labeled monoclonal mouse anti-IgG1 antibody as a detection reagent.\n\n\nTie2 phosphorylation assay. The effect of the selective angiopoietin inhibitors on Ang1-induced Tie2 phosphorylation in mouse lungs was performed as described in Hodous, B. L., et al. 2007., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n50:611-626). Briefly, CD-1 nude mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass.) were treated s.c. once daily for 23 days with Fc control (20 mg/kg), mL4-3 (20 mg/kg) or L1-7(N) (2 mg/kg). Mice (n=3 per group) were then administered 12 μg by i.v. injection of recombinant Ang1 (R&D Systems Inc.). Fifteen minutes later, mouse lungs were harvested, and the levels of phosphorylated Tie2 were determined by immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Fisher's post hoc test using StatView 5.0.1 software (SAS Institute Inc.). Results are expressed as mean±standard error (SE).\n\n\nTumor xenograft models. Eight- to 10-week old female CD1 nude mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used in all experiments. Mice were injected s.c. with 2×10\n6 \nColo205 cells in one-third volume Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). Peptibodies or Fc control were administered by s.c. injection once tumors were established. \nAMG\n 386 was dosed twice per week; the other peptibodies and Fc control were dosed once daily. Where necessary, Fc control protein was added to the treatment groups to match the total amount of protein delivered in the combination group (5.2 mg/kg). Tumor measurements and body weights were recorded twice per week. All tumor studies were performed in a blinded fashion. Tumor volume was calculated as length×width×height in mm\n3 \nResults are expressed as mean±SE. Statistical analysis was performed using repeated measures analysis of variance followed by a Scheffé post hoc test using StatView 5.0.1 software (SAS Institute Inc.).\n\n\nTumor endothelial cell proliferation assay. Tumor endothelial cell proliferation was assayed as previously described (Oliner, J., et al. 2004., \nCancer Cell \n6:507-516). Briefly, Colo205 tumor-bearing mice were treated systemically with peptibodies for 72 hours and implanted with osmotic pumps containing 3 mg/\nmL BrdU\n 16 hours prior to euthanasia. Tumors were harvested, dissociated, fixed, and stained to allow determination of BrdU incorporation in tumor endothelial cells. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t-test.\n\n\nCorneal angiogenesis model. VEGF and bFGF-induced angiogenesis studies were performed in female CD rats (n=8 per group) as described in Coxon, A., et al. \nArthritis Rheum \n46:2604-2612, 2002. Inhibition of interleukin-1 but not tumor necrosis factor suppresses neovascularization in rat models of corneal angiogenesis and adjuvant arthritis. Treatment with Fc (60 mg/kg), L1-7(N) (5 mg/kg), mL4-3 (60 mg/kg), or the combination of L1-7(N) and mL4-3 (at the same doses used in the single-agent groups) was initiated on the day prior to surgery and continued on \nday\n 3 and \nday\n 6. On \nday\n 8 the study was terminated and the corneas were photographed, as described (Oliner, J., et al. 2004., \nCancer Cell \n6:507-516). For each corneal image, the number of blood vessels intersecting the midpoint between the implanted disc and the limbus was counted. All evaluations were performed in a blinded fashion. Statistical significance was assessed by ANOVA followed by Fisher's post hoc test.\n\n\nRetinal neovascularization. Ischemic retinopathy was produced in C57BL/6J mice using the method described by Smith et al., \nInvest. Ophthalmol Vis Sci \n35: 101-111, 1994. Postnatal day seven (P7) pups and their mothers were placed in a hyperoxic chamber (75±0.5% oxygen) for 5 days and then returned to room air for an additional 5 days (n=7 pups per group). Chamber temperature was maintained between 20° C. and 22° C., and oxygen was constantly controlled by an oxygen control unit (ProOx Model P110 coupled to an oxygen sensor Model E702 Biospherix Ltd, Redfield, N.Y.). One cage with P7 pups remained at room air (normoxia condition). Fc control (200 mg/kg), mL4-3 (100 mg/kg), L1-7(N) (100 mg/kg), or mL4-3/L1-7(N) combination (100 mg/kg each) was administered s.c. once daily for nine days starting on P8. From P8 to P11 the injections were administered using ports to gain access into the chamber. On P17 the pups were sacrificed and their eyes removed and fixed using Davidson's fixative. The eyes were then processed into paraffin using standard methods. Step sections were cut parallel to the optical axis at 100-1 μm intervals. The blocks were completely through-sectioned, resulting in 15 or 16 sections per eye. All sections were stained with H&E. Of the 15 or 16 slides in the step-section series, the middle 10 consecutive slides were used in the analyses, bracketing either side of the optical axis. For each section, the number of vascular nuclei (both endothelial and pericyte nuclei) that were on the vitreous side of the inner limiting membrane were counted. The individual slide counts were recorded and all ten section counts summed for each animal. Five mice in each study group were counted. All counts were performed in a blinded fashion, without knowledge of treatment conditions. Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA followed by Fisher's post hoc test.\n\n\nOvarian follicular angiogenesis. Superovulation was induced in study mice using standard methodology. Briefly, four-week old female C57BL/6J mice were injected with 5-7 IU PMS, effectively resetting the estrus cycle. Forty-eight hours later, the mice were injected with 5 IU of HCG to induce superovulation. The females were then faux-bred and remained on study for 24 hours. Study mice were treated with peptibodies twice per day. Dosing commenced at the time of the initial PMS injection and continued for two consecutive days, with the fourth dose given concurrently with the HCG injection. Mice were euthanized 48 hours following the HCG injection. Right and left ovaries were removed and immersion-fixed in cold zinc tris solution. After 48 hours, ovaries were transferred to 70% ethanol and processed to paraffin using standard methods. Two sequential sections were cut from each ovary pair and individually stained either with H&E or immunostained for vascular endothelium (CD31, rat anti-mouse monoclonal MEC 13.3, BD Biosciences Pharmingen) using DAB as the chromogen. Additionally, the anti-CD31 IHC sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. The individual follicles selected for analysis were identified based on transformational state. This was determined by treatment-blind inspection of the H&E sections under low power. Corresponding images of ten transformed follicles per animal, where feasible, were then captured at 10× objective magnification from the anti-CD31 immunostained sections. The follicle section area was delineated as a ROI, and the CD31-positive area fraction was determined via RGB thresholding using MetaMorph image analysis software (MetaMorph v6.1, UIC, Downingtown, Pa.). Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's post hoc test.\n\n\nEvaluation of normal tissues in treated rats. Peptibodies were evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) for effects on normal tissues Animals received 300 mg/kg of \nAMG\n 386, L1-7(N) or mL4-3 IV twice weekly for 28 days (n=10 animals per group). At scheduled necropsy, a full tissue set was sectioned, stained, and observed for microscopic changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptibodies competitively inhibit angiopoietin: Tie2 interactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nhAng1\n\n\nhAng2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAgent\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\nIC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL1-7(N)\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n0.064\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmL4-3\n\n\n0.022\n\n\n3085\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nAMG\n 386\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n0.029\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFc\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nh, human\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmL4-3 selectively neutralizes Ang1:Tie2 interactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhAng1\n\n\nmAng1\n\n\nrAng1\n\n\ncAng1\n\n\nhAng2\n\n\nmAng2\n\n\ncAng2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmL4-3\n\n\n0.045\n\n\n0.033\n\n\n0.061\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n1876\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n1890\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFc\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n>10,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nh, human;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nm, mouse;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nr, rabbit;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc, cynomolgus monkey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean pharmacokinetic parameters of angiopoietin\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninhibitors in mice and rats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMouse\n\n\nRat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDose-normalized\n\n\n \n\n\nDose-normalized\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nt\n1/2\n \n\n\nAUC\n0-inf\n \n\n\nt\n1/2\n \n\n\nAUC\n0-inf\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent\n\n\n(hr)\n\n\n(μM · hr/mg/kg)\n\n\n(hr)\n\n\n(μM · hr/mg/kg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmL4-3\n\n\n45\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n42\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL1-7(N)\na\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n7.0\n\n\n47\n\n\n4.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAMG\n 386\na\n \n\n\n97\n\n\n15\n\n\n85\n\n\n8.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nAdapted from Oliner et al (18).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelective inhibition of Ang1 or Ang2 induces ovarian atrophy,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbut not epiphyseal plate thickening\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEpiphyseal plate\n\n\nEpiphyseal plate\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgent\n\n\nthickening (males)\n\n\nthickening (females)\n\n\n \nOvarian atrophy\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAMG\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 386\n\n\n10\n\n\n10\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL1-7(N)\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmL4-3\n\n\n0\n\n\n0\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nn = 10 per group"

The United States government has certain rights in the invention.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe endogenous cholinergic neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, exert its biological effect via two types of cholinergic receptors; the muscarinic ACh receptors and the nicotinic ACh receptors. As it is well established that muscarinic ACh receptors dominate quantitatively over nicotinic ACh receptors in the brain area important to memory and cognition, much research aimed at the development of agents for the treatment of memory related disorders have focused on the synthesis of muscarinic ACh receptor modulators. Recently, however, an interest in the development of nicotinic ACh receptor modulators has emerged. Several diseases are associated with degeneration of the cholinergic system i.e. senile dementia of the Alzheimer type, vascular dementia and cognitive impairment due to the organic brain damage disease related directly to alcoholism. Indeed several CNS disorders can be attributed to a cholinergic deficiency, a dopaminergic deficiency, an adrenergic deficiency or a serotonergic deficiency. Alzheimer's disease is characterised by a profound loss of memory and cognitive functions caused by a severe depletion of cholinergic neurons, i.e. neurons that release acetylcholine. A reduction in the number of nicotinic ACh receptors are also observed with the progression of Alzheimer's disease. It is believed that the neurons in the cortex that die with the progression of Alzheimer's disease do so because of lack of stimulation of the nicotinic ACh receptors. It is predicted that treatment of Alzheimer patients with nicotinic ACh receptor modulators will not only improve the memory of patients but in addition act to keep these neurons alive. Smoking actually seems to protect individuals against neurodegeneration and compounds behaving on these receptor may very likely have a generally neuroprotective effect.\n\n\nHowever degeneration of the cholinergic system is not limited to individuals suffering from i.e. Alzheimers disease but is also seen in healthy aged adults and rats. Therefore it is suggested that the cholinergic system is involved and partly responsible for the memory disturbances seen in aged animals and humans. Nicotine receptor modulator may therefore be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, memory loss, memory dysfunction, AIDS-dementia, senile dementia or neurodegenerative disorders.\n\n\nParkinsons disease appears to involve degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. One symptom of the disease has been observed to be loss of nicotinic receptors associated with the dopaminergic neurons and possibly interfering with the process of release of dopamine. As sustained nicotine administration increases the number of receptors present, administration of nicotine receptor modulators may ameliorate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Other condition or disorders or disease ascribed to deficiencies in the dopaminergic system is: drug addiction, depression, obesity and narcolepsy.\n\n\nTourette's syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder involving a range of neurological and behavioral symptoms. It is believed that neurotransmitter dysfunction is involved though the pathophysiology is still unknown and that nicotine will be beneficial in the treatment of the disease (Devor et. al. The Lancet, vol. 8670 p. 1046, 1989).\n\n\nSchizophrenia is a severe psychiatric illness. Neuroleptic compounds has been used in the treatment of the disease, the effect of the compounds is believed to be interaction in the dopaminergic system. Nicotine is proposed to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia (Merriam et. al. Psychiatr. annals, Vol. 23, p. 171-178, 1993 and Adler et. al. Biol. Psychiatry, Vol. 32, p. 607-616, 1992.)\n\n\nNicotine has been reported to have en effect on neurotransmitter release in several systems. Release of acetylcholine and dopamine by neurons upon administration of nicotine has been reported (J. Neurochem. vol. 43, 1593-1598, 1984) and release of norepinephrine by Hall et. al. (Biochem. Pharmacol. vol. 21, 1829-1838, 1972) Release of serotonin by Hery et. al. (Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. vol. 296. p. 91-97, 1977). Release of glutamate by Toth et. al (Neurochem. Res. vol. 17, p. 265-271, 1992).\n\n\nThe serotonin system and dysfunction's of the serotonergic system is believed to be involved in diseases or conditions or disorders like: anxiety, depression, eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorders, chemical substance abuse, alcoholism, pain, memory deficits and anxiety, pseudodementia, Ganser's syndrome, migraine pain, bulimia, obesity, premenstrual syndrome or late luteal phase syndrome, tobacco abuse, post-traumatic syndrome, social phobia, chronic fatigue syndrome, premature ejaculation, erectile difficulty, anorexia nervosa, disorders of sleep, autism, mutism or trichotillomania.\n\n\nNicotine improves concentration and task performance. Therefore compounds exhibiting nicotine receptor modulating properties will be likely to be useful compounds in the treatment of leaning deficit, cognition deficit, attention deficit, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia.\n\n\nTobacco use and especially cigarette smoking is recognised as a serious health problem. However nicotine withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation makes it difficult to break this habit. Withdrawal symptoms include anger, anxiety, difficulties in concentrating, restlessness, decreased heart rate and increased appetite and weight gain. Nicotine itself has shown to ease the withdrawal symptoms.\n\n\nWithdrawal from addictive substances, i.e. opiates, benzodiazepines, ethanol, tobacco or nicotine, is in general a traumatic experience characterized by anxiety and frustration. Nicotine has been found to be effective in reducing anger, irritability, frustration and feelings of tension without causing general response depression, drowsiness or sedation and compounds having same characteristics as nicotine is likely to have same effects.\n\n\nMild to moderate pain is normally treatable with NSAID's (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) while opiates are used preferentially for moderate to severe pain. The opiates have some well-known side-effects, including chemical dependence and abuse potential as well as a depressive effect on the respiratory and gastrointestinal system. There exists therefore a strong need for analgesic compounds that do not exhibit these side effects and which can relieve mild, moderate and severe pain of acute, chronic or recurrent character as well as migraine pain and postoperative pain, phantom limb pain.\n\n\nEpibatidine, a compound isolated from the skin of a poison frog, is a very potent analgesic with an approximate potency of 500 times that of morphine. The analgesic effect is not affected by naloxone, which is an indication of a negligible affinity for the opiate receptors. Epibatidine is an nicotinic cholinergic receptor agonist and it is therefore very likely, that compounds possessing this receptor modulating character will also show a strong analgesic response. It is well known that nicotine has an effect on appetite and it is predicted that modulators at the nicotine ACh receptor may be useful as appetite suppressants in the treatment of obesity and eating disorders.\n\n\nIn addition to epibatidine, various heterocyclic 2-pyrrolidinyloxy-substituted compounds with analgesic and hypotensive activities have been disclosed by Scheffler et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,643,995) and Tomioka et al. (Chem. Pharm. Bull, 38:2133-5, 1990).\n\n\nCertain other 2-pyridyloxy-substituted compounds are disclosed inter alia by Engel et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,946,836 as having analgesic activity.\n\n\nVarious other compounds having a pyrrolidine or azetidine moiety substituted at the 3-position with a heterocycloxy group have also been disclosed (cf. U.S. Pat. No. 4,592,866 to A. D. Cale; U.S. Pat. No. 4,705,853 to A. D. Cale; U.S. Pat. No. 4,956,359 to Taylor et al.; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,037,841 to Schoehe et al. and European patent application EP296560A2, to Sugimoto et al.).\n\n\nThe cholinergic receptors play an important role in the functioning of muscles, organs and generally in the central nervous system. There are also complex interactions between cholinergic receptors and the function of receptors of other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline.\n\n\nIt is likely that nicotine receptor modulator compounds can be effective in preventing or treating conditions or disorders or diseases like: inflammation, inflammatory skin conditions, Chron's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative collitis, diarrhoea, neurodegeneration, perpherical neuropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, nociception, endocrine disorders, thyrotoxicosis, pheochromocytoma, hypertension, arrhytmias, mania, manic depression, Huntington's disease, jetlag.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are nicotine receptor modulators and have the potential to exhibit nicotinic pharmacology, preferentially without the side effects associated with nicotine itself. Additionally, the compounds are expected to have the potential as enhancers of neurotransmitter secretion and suppress symptoms associated with a low activity of neurotransmitters.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE

In a broad aspect, the permissible substituents include acyclic and cyclic, branched and unbranched, carbocyclic and heterocyclic, aromatic and nonaromatic substituents of organic compounds. Illustrative substituents include, for example, those described herein above. The permissible substituents can be one or more and the same or different for appropriate organic compounds. For purposes of this invention, the heteroatoms such as nitrogen may have hydrogen substituents and/or any permissible substituents of organic compounds described herein which satisfy the valences of the heteroatoms. This invention is not intended to be limited in any manner by the permissible substituents of organic compounds.\n\n\nThe phrase “protecting group” as used herein means temporary substituents which protect a potentially reactive functional group from undesired chemical transformations.

The present invention contemplates all such compounds, including cis- and trans-isomers, R- and S-enantiomers, diastereomers, (\nD\n)-isomers, (\nL\n) -isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, as failing within the scope of the invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention.\n\n\nIf, for instance, a particular enantiomer of a compound of the present invention is desired, it may be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, it may be isolated using chiral chromatography methods, or by derivation with a chiral auxiliary, where the resulting diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic functional group, such as amino, or an acidic functional group, such as carboxyl, diastereomeric salts are formed with an appropriate optically-active acid or base, followed by resolution of the diastereomers thus formed by fractional crystallization or chromatographic means well known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantiomers.\n\n\nContemplated equivalents of the compounds described above include compounds which otherwise correspond thereto, and which have the same general properties thereof (e.g., functioning as analgesics), wherein one or more simple variations of substituents are made which do not adversely affect the efficacy of the compound in binding to opioid receptors. In general, the compounds of the present invention may be prepared by the methods illustrated in the general reaction schemes as, for example, described below, or by modifications thereof using readily available starting materials, reagents and conventional synthesis procedures. In these reactions, it is also possible to make use of variants which are in themselves known, but are not mentioned here.\n\n\nFor purposes of this invention, the chemical elements are identified in accordance with the Periodic Table of the Elements, CAS version, Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 67th Ed., 1986-87, inside cover.\n\n\nDISCUSSION OF SELECTED PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been shown that C-5 position of the pyridyl moiety of A-84543 (8) could tolerate sterically bulky substituents without losing the binding affinity at α4β2 nAChR. We investigated the effects of the C-5 substituents of the pyridine on the binding affinity and subtype-selectivity at neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors caused by the steric factor as well as the hydropathy profile of the introduced group. In the nicotinic series, introduction of an ethynyl substituent at the C-5 position of the pyridyl ring lead to SIB-1508Y (4) with altered subtype selectivity for neuronal nAChRs. Thus, a series of 5-alkynyl substituted A-84543 analogues 11-17 were prepared in good yields from 5-\nbromo derivative\n 10 by Pd—C catalyzed Sonogashira reaction in aqueous system (Scheme 1). The intermediate 10 was readily obtained by treatment of 3,5-dibromopyridine with (S)-1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinylmethanol (9) in the presence of sodium hydride. The 5-ethynyl derivative 19 was prepared by treatment 12 with NaH. Catalytic hydrogenation of 10 and 16 on Pd—C provided 8 and 19, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-(6-Hydroxy-1-hexynyl) derivative 26 and N-demethyl analogue of 16 were synthesized as shown in \nScheme\n 2. Treatment of the \nalcohols\n 20 and 21 with 3-bromo-5-hydroxypyridine under Mitsunobu conditions provided the corresponding 3-pyridyl ethers 22 and 23, which were coupled with 5-hexyn-1-ol under the Pd—C catalyzed Sonogashira reaction protocol to afford the corresponding 24 and 25 in good yield. Removal of the Boc protection groups in 24 and 25 provided 26 and 27, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo epibatidine analogues 31 and 34 were prepared as shown in \nSchemes\n 3 and 4, respectively. Reductive Heck reaction of the olefin 28 with 3,5-dibromopyridine provided 29, which was coupled with 6-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-1-hexyne under the catalysis with Pd(PPh\n3\n)Cl\n2 \nand CuI to give 30. Removal of the TBS and Boc protection groups together with trifluoroacetic acid provided 5-(6-hydroxy-1-hexynyl) substituted dechloroepibatidine analogue 31 (Scheme 3). 6-(6-Hydroxy-1-hexynyl) substituted epibatidine analogue 34 were prepared from 32 in a similar manner (Scheme 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree fluorine-containing 3-pyridyl ether analogues 36, 41, and 42 were also prepared, in particular, with the expectation that they could serve for PET imaging purposes if appropriately labeled with \n18\nF. 5-(6-Fluoro-1-hexynyl) derivative 36 was prepared from the alcohol 16 by treatment with iodine in the presence of PPh\n3 \nand imidazole, followed by silver fluoride (Scheme 5). Tosylation of the alcohols 24 and 25 provided the corresponding tosylates 37 and 38. Treatment of 37 and 38 with tetrabutylammonium fluoride followed by trifluoroacetic acid gave 41 and 42, respectively, in good yields (Scheme 6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to assess the steric and hydropathic effects of the C-5 substituents of the pyridine on the binding affinity and subtype-selectivity at neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. A series of A-84543 analogues 10-19 were evaluated by their binding assays at the six heterologously expressed nAChR subtypes (α2β2, α2β4, α3β2, α3β4, α4β2, and α4β4) and at receptors in rat forebrain. The results are summarized in Table 1. The binding affinity ratios for a ligand, calculated from its affinities at an α subunit paired with either the β2 osubunit or the β4 subunit, represents a measure of the selectivity of that ligand with regard to the β subunits. These ratios are shown in Table 2. We also compared the affinities of these agonists for the heterologously expressed α3β4 subunit combination to their affinities for the rat forebrain receptor. An α3β4 subtype is found in many sympathetic ganglia, while an α4β2 subtype is the predominant receptor in rat forebrain; therefore, the affinity ratios of drugs at these subtypes can help to predict the likelihood of possibly limiting autonomic nervous system side effects of drugs aimed at the predominant receptor in forebrain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding affinities (K\ni\n, nM) of (−)-nicotine (1), (±)-epibatidine (2) and 3, 4, 6-8, 11,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 at heterologously expressed nAChR subtypes and rat forebrain\na\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK\ni\n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nRat\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLigand\n\n\nR=\n\n\nα2β2\n\n\nα2β4\n\n\nα3β2\n\n\nα3β4\n\n\nα4β2\n\n\nα4β4\n\n\nforebrain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n12\n\n\n112\n\n\n47\n\n\n443\n\n\n10\n\n\n40\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n0.095\n\n\n0.035\n\n\n0.565\n\n\n0.061\n\n\n0.157\n\n\n0.060\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n0.073\n\n\n18.4\n\n\n0.208\n\n\n77.7\n\n\n0.142\n\n\n8.04\n\n\n0.248\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.07\n\n\n209.0\n\n\n9.04\n\n\n835.0\n\n\n1.40\n\n\n205.0\n\n\n5.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.32\n\n\n546\n\n\n29.3\n\n\n2,040\n\n\n1.56\n\n\n345\n\n\n7.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.75\n\n\n434\n\n\n10.7\n\n\n3,080\n\n\n1.02\n\n\n473\n\n\n3.65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.52\n\n\n437\n\n\n4.96\n\n\n2,460\n\n\n0.936\n\n\n369\n\n\n6.40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.4\n\n\n1,720\n\n\n20.3\n\n\n9,560\n\n\n2.61\n\n\n1410\n\n\n6.81\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.19\n\n\n8,240\n\n\n7.27\n\n\n59,900\n\n\n2.07\n\n\n8280\n\n\n3.71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.43\n\n\n1,880\n\n\n7.64\n\n\n18,200\n\n\n0.954\n\n\n1690\n\n\n3.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.93\n\n\n5,890\n\n\n19.70\n\n\n32,600\n\n\n1.34\n\n\n5060\n\n\n8.39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.87\n\n\n3,230\n\n\n12.6\n\n\n40,200\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n1270\n\n\n3.56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.8\n\n\n7,800\n\n\n52.1\n\n\n62,700\n\n\n6.50\n\n\n3560\n\n\n21.70\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.33\n\n\n1,150\n\n\n13.40\n\n\n20,000\n\n\n0.75\n\n\n968\n\n\n5.39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nK\nd \nvalues (nM) for [\n3\nH]-epibatidine used for calculating K\ni \nvalues were 0.02 for α2β2, 0.08 for α2β4, 0.03 for α3β2, 0.30 for α3β4, 0.04 for α4β2 and 0.09 for α4β4.

A-85380 (7) and A-84543 (8) possessed very high affinity for all three of the nAChR subtypes containing β2 subunits but much lower affinity for the subtypes containing β 4 subunits, although the best selectivities among the six nAChR subtypes and rat forebrain are still less than 400-fold. The improved selectivity suggests the possibility of developing subtype-selective ligands and therapeutically useful drugs. As a matter of fact, 7 and 8, as the novel lead compounds, have caused extensive investigation since their discovery in the mid 1990s. Introduction of additional substituent groups at the C5 position of the pyridyl ring of 8 resulting 10-19 didn't cause any significant difference on the binding affinities at the α4β2 containing subtype or the rat forebrain (within 5-fold). These results are in accord with the previous conclusion that the C5 position of the pyridyl ring of 8 could tolerate substitutions without losing affinity for α4β2 receptor subtype. However, it is noteworthy that the subtype selectivities of the derivatives 10-19 among the six heterologously expressed neuronal nAChR subtypes and rat forebrain are much dependent on the properties of the substituent groups. First of all, the presence of a bulky substitutions at the C5 position of pyridyl part slightly improved the nAChR subtype selectivity for α4β2 or the receptors in rat forebrain over the ganglionic α3β4, although the steric volume of substitutions has little effect on α4β2 nAChR binging affinity. Secondly, the ligands 13-17 and 19 with appendages containing additional polar groups, such as hydroxyl group and amide group, show significantly improved affinity ratios, e.g. α2β4/α2β2, α3β4/α3β2, α4β4/α4β2, and α3β4/forbrain, in comparison to 8. For example, the affinity ratios, as compared in Table 2, for 13 are over 4000 and up to 16,000. These high active and selective analogues containing to appropriately functionalized side-chain appendages are quite interesting, because in addition to their general use as pharmacological tools, they can be used to make fluorescent probes and affinity columns for certain nAChR subtypes, as well as for PET imaging study after labeled with \n11\nC or \n18\nF. The 5-(6-hydroxy-1-hexynyl) derivative 16 is one of the best ligands possessing not only high affinity for the α4β2 subtype but also high selectivity among the nAChR subtypes compared. Its analogue 17 with a prolonged (10-carbon) side-chain appendage shows both lower affinity and less subtype selectivity at the six heterologously expressed nAChR subtypes and rat forebrain. The saturated analogue 19 shows similar binding affinities for the 132 containing subtypes as those of 16, but the former is a little less selective.\n\n\nThe 6-hydroxy-1-hexynyl substituent at the CS position of the pyridine ring of 16 is an optimum group for attaining both the expected high binding affinity at the α4β2 receptor and the excellent subtype-selectivity. Therefore, 5-(6-hydroxy-1-hexynyl) substituted A-85380 analogue 26, N-demethyl 5-(6-hydroxy-1-hexynyl) substituted A-84543 analogue 27 were prepared and evaluated at the six defined rat nicotinic receptor subtypes and rat forebrain. The binding affinity results, together with the subtype selectivity of α3β4 vs the receptors in rat forebrain, are summarized in Table 3. The N-demethyl derivative 27 shows a little higher not only binding affinities at the nAChR subtypes but also subtype selectivity of α3β4 vs rat forebrain than its N-methyl analogue 16. Similar to 16 and 27, the four-membered ring analogue 26 possessed much higher affinities at receptors composed of an α subunit in combination with the β2 subunit than the β4 subunit. In fact, 26 is the most selective nAChR agonist known at α4β2 vs ganglionic α3β4 receptors (54,000-fold) while possessed the similar high binding affinity as epibatidine (2) and A-85380 (7) at the α4β2 subtype.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding affinities (K\ni\n, nM) of 16, 26, 27, 31, 34, 36, 41, 42 at heterologously\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpressed nAChR subtypes and rat forebrain\na\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nK\ni \n(nM)\n\n\nAffinity ratio\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLigand\n\n\nα2β2\n\n\nα2β4\n\n\nα3β2\n\n\nα3β4\n\n\nα4β2\n\n\nα4β4\n\n\nForebrain\n\n\n(α3β4/Forbrain)\nb\n \n\n\ncLogP\nc\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n2.87\n\n\n3,230\n\n\n12.6\n\n\n40,200\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n1270\n\n\n3.56\n\n\n11,292\n\n\n2.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n269\n\n\n0.53\n\n\n4,840\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n74\n\n\n—\n\n\n53,778\n\n\n1.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n1.51\n\n\n835\n\n\n2.69\n\n\n16,100\n\n\n0.665\n\n\n778\n\n\n1.15\n\n\n14,000\n\n\n1.68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n0.352\n\n\n45.10\n\n\n0.146\n\n\n266.0\n\n\n0.166\n\n\n15.40\n\n\n0.215\n\n\n1,237\n\n\n1.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\n16.90\n\n\n67.40\n\n\n19.8\n\n\n95.40\n\n\n67.70\n\n\n61.80\n\n\n52.00\n\n\n2\n\n\n1.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n\n0.796\n\n\n197\n\n\n0.635\n\n\n5,490\n\n\n0.201\n\n\n118\n\n\n0.362\n\n\n15,166\n\n\n2.38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n3.50\n\n\n680\n\n\n5.27\n\n\n7,580\n\n\n0.907\n\n\n721\n\n\n3.45\n\n\n2,197\n\n\n2.94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nK\nd \nvalues (nM) for [\n3\nH]-epibatidine used for calculating K\ni \nvalues were 0.02 for α2β2, 0.08 for α2β4, 0.03 for α3β2, 0.30 for α3β4, 0.04 for α4β2 and 0.09 for α4β4.

It is noteworthy that, although a lot of epibatidine analogues have been prepared with the expectation to improve their subtype selectivity, in most reports, pharmacological investigations, if conducted at all, are limited to measurements at the α4β2 receptor or only one or two other nAChR subtypes. A very recent study reveals that introduction of a bulky phenyl group at the C5 position of the pyridyl ring of epibatidine results in ligands with antagonist action. On the other hand, it has been shown that dechloroepibatidine binds with similar affinity as epibatidine at the α4β2 nAChR subtype. Thus, the 5-(6-hydroxy-1-hexynyl) substituted dechloroepibatidine analogues 31 was prepared and evaluated at the six rat nicotinic receptor subtypes and rat forebrain. As shown in Table 3, 31 also possessed subnanomolar affinities at the β2 containing subtypes although there are 3-14 folds less active than epibatidine (2) at each β2 containing subtypes. It is noteworthy that 31 was quite selective for an α subunit paired with the β2 versus the β4 subunit, and the affinity ratios were up to 1,800. While epibatidine itself activates and binds to most nAChR subtypes with picomolar affinity (K; ratios less than 20). 6-(6-Hydroxy-1-hexynyl) substituted dechloroepibatidine analogue 34, 200-1000 folds lower binding affinities than epibatidine at the nAChRs, didn't show much subtype selectivity among the neuronal nAChRs interest (less than 6-fold). This result is in agreement with the previous results that introduction of a bulky substituent at C6-position of the pyridine ring of both epibatidine and nicotine resulted in markedly decreased nAChR binding affinities. Together with the present results, we can conclude that the nicotine analogues, epibatidine analogues, and the 3-pyridyl ether analogues herein are binding in a similar fashion at the nAChRs. The C5-position, if not the only position, of the pyridyl ring of nicotine, epibatidine, and the 3-pyridyl ether analogues (e.g. 7 and 8) could tolerate an additional large polar group to obtain significant subtype selectivity without losing the binding affinity at the α4β2 subtype.\n\n\nAll of the three fluoride analogues of 16, 26, and 27, i.e. compounds 36, 41, and 42, show not only subnanomolar affinities for α4β2 nAChR subtype but also excellent selectivities (up to 15,000-fold) for the receptors in rat forebrain over α3β4 subtype. The excellent receptor affinity and subtype selectivity of these fluoride analogues are very useful as they are potential agents for PET imaging study in the diagnosis of certain CNS disorders. It is noteworthy that the selective ligands 14-16 could also be extremely useful for the PET imaging study by labeling the N-methyl as \n11\nC-methyl, as these ligands with lower lipophilicity (lower cLogP values) which is desirable to decrease nonspecific binding of the radioligands.\n\n\nThe therapeutic potential of nicotinic ligands depends substantially on the ability to affect selectively certain receptor subtypes with beneficial effects. While nicotine, epibatidine, and some 3-pyridyl ethers show good affinity for the neuronal nAChRs, they generally lack selectivity. Along with our objective in the design of subtype selective nAChR ligands, we discovered that introduction of a bulky hydrophilic group, like 6-hydroxy-1-hexynyl, at the C5 position of the pyridyl ring of nicotine (1), epibatidine (2), and the 3-pyridyl ether analogues (7 and 8) could significantly improve n AChR subtype selectivity at receptors composed of an α subunit in combination with the β2 subunit than the β4 subunit without losing the binding affinities at the α4β2 subtype. For example, compounds 26, 27, and 31 were 2 orders of magnitude more selective for α4β2 over α3β4 than the corresponding \n \n \nparent compounds\n \n \n 7, 8, and 2. These ligands with high affinity and selectivity are quite interesting because, in addition to their general use as pharmacological tools, they containing appropriately functionalized side-chain appendages could be used to make fluorescent probes and affinity columns for certain nAChR subtypes. In light of the high affinity and selectivity found for ligands 14-16 and the fluorinated analogues 36, 41, and 42, their use in brain PET imaging studies is an aspect of the present invention.\n\n\nSynthesis of Compounds\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be prepared by any conventional method useful for the preparation of analogous compounds and as described in the examples below.\n\n\nStarting materials for the processes described in the present patent application are known or can be prepared by known processes from commercially available materials.\n\n\nA compound of the invention can be converted to another compound of the invention using conventional methods.\n\n\nThe products of the reactions described herein are isolated by conventional means such as extraction, crystallization, distillation, chromatography, and the like.\n\n\nExamples of the nicotinic ACh receptor ligands of the present invention may be prepared by the general methods described in the Schemes hereinafter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReductive Heck reaction on 24 and 27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEntry\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nConditions\n\n\nProducts (ratio)\na\n \n\n\nYield (%)\nb\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n24\n\n\nPd(OAc)\n2\n, 2-chloro-5-iodopyridine,\n\n\n25:26 (5.0:1)\n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHCO\n2\nNa, n-Bu\n4\nNCl, DMF,100 ° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n24\n\n\nPd(OAc)\n2\n(PPh)\n2\n, 2-chloro-5-\n\n\n25:26 (2.5:1)\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\niodopyridine, piperidine, HCO\n2\nH,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDMF, 75° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n24\n\n\nPd(PPh)\n4\n, 2-chloro-5-iodopyridine,\n\n\n25:26 (0.9:1)\n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\npiperidine, HCO\n2\nH, DMF, 75° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n27\n\n\nPd(PPh)\n4\n, 2-chloro-5-iodopyridine,\n\n\n28:29 (12:1)\nc\n \n\n\n92\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\npiperidine, HCO\n2\nH, DMF, 75° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nRatios were determined from the \n1\nH NMR spectra of the product mixtures after chromatography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nb\nOverall yields were of isolated material after chromatography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nc\nRatio was determined from the \n1\nH NMR spectrum of the crude reaction products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nBinding Affinity Assays\n\n\n\nMany different assay methods can be used to determine the activity of the compounds of the present invention. These assay methods include, for example, the following but also include other methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nNicotinic ACh receptors in the brain are pentameric structures composed of subunits distinct from those found in skeletal muscles. The existence of eight α-subunits (α2-α9) and three β-subunits (β2-β4) in the mammalian brain has been described.\n\n\nThe predominant subtype with high affinity for nicotine is comprised of three α-subunits and two β-subunits.\n\n\nThe affinity of compounds of the invention for nicotinic ACh receptors may be investigated in three tests for in vitro inhibition of \n3\nH-epibatidin binding, \n3\nH-α-bungarotoxin binding and \n3\nH-cytisine binding as described below:\n\n\nIn Vitro Inhibition of \n3\nH-Cytisine Binding\n\n\nThe predominant subtype with high affinity for nicotine is comprised of α4 and β2 subunits. nAChRs of the latter type may selectively be labelled by the nicotine agonist \n3\nH-cytisine.\n\n\nTissue Preparation: Preparations may be performed at 0-4° C. unless otherwise indicated. Cerebral corticies from male Wistar rats (150-250 g) may be homogenized for 20 sec in 15 mL Tris, HCl (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and 2.5 mM CaCl2 using an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer. The homogenate may then be centrifuged at 27,000×g for 10 min. The supernatant may then be discarded and the pellet resuspended in fresh buffer and centrifuged a second time. The final pellet may be resuspended in fresh buffer (35 mL per g of original tissue) and used for binding assays.\n\n\nAssay: Aliquots of 500 μl homogenate may be added to 25 μl of test solution and 25 μl of \n3\nH-cytisine (1 nM, final concentration), mixed and incubated for 90 min at 2° C. Non-specific binding may then be determined using (−)-nicotine (100 μM, final concentration). After incubation the samples may be added to 5 mL of ice-cold buffer and poured directly onto Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters under suction and immediately washed with 2×5 mL ice-cold buffer. The amount of radioactivity on the filters may then be determined by conventional liquid scintillation counting. Specific binding is total binding minus non-specific binding.\n\n\nIn Vitro Inhibition of \n3\nH-α-Bungarotoxin Binding Rat Brain\n\n\nα-Bungarotoxin is a peptide isolated from the venom of the Elapidae snake Bungarus multicinctus (Mebs et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 44(3), 711 (1971)) and has high affinity for neuronal and neuromuscular nicotinic receptors, where it acts as a potent antagonist. \n3\nH-α-Bungarotoxin binds to a single site in rat brain with a unique distribution pattern in rat brain (Clarke et al., J. Neurosci. 5, 1307-1315 (1985)).\n\n\n \n3\nH-α-Bungarotoxin labels nAChR are formed by the α7 subunit isoform found in the brain and the isoform in the neuromuscular junction (Changeaux, Fidia Res. Found. Neurosci. Found. Lect. 4, 21-168 (1990). Functionally, the α7 homo-oligomer expressed in oocytes has a calcium permeability greater than neuromuscular receptors and, in some instances greater than NMDA channels (Seguela et al., J. Neurosci. 13, 596-604 (1993).\n\n\nTissue Preparation: Preparations may be performed at 0-4° C. unless otherwise indicated. Cerebral cortices from male Wistar rats (150-250 g) may be homogenized for 10 sec in 15 \nmL\n 20 mM Hepes buffer containing 118 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4 and 2.5 mM CaCl2 (pH 7.5) using an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer. The tissue suspension may then be centrifuged at 27,000×g for 10 min. The supernatant is discarded and the pellet is washed twice by centrifugation at 27,000×g for 10 min in 20 mL fresh buffer, and the final pellet may be resuspended in fresh buffer containing 0.01% BSA (35 mL per g of original tissue) and used for binding assays.\n\n\nAssay: Aliquots of 500 μl homogenate may be added to 25 μl of test solution and 25 μl of \n3\nH-α-bungarotoxin (2 nM, final concentration), mixed and incubated for 2 h at 37° C. Non-specific binding may then be determined using (−)-nicotine (1 mM, final concentration). After incubation the samples may be added to 5 mL of ice-cold Hepes buffer containing 0.05% PEI and poured directly onto Whatman GF/C glass fibre filters (presoaked in 0.1% PEI for at least 6 h) under suction and immediately washed with 2×5 mL ice-cold buffer. The amount of radioactivity on the filters may then be determined by conventional liquid scintillation counting. Specific binding is total binding minus non-specific binding.\n\n\nIn Vitro Inhibition of \n3\nH-Epibatidin Binding\n\n\nAs discussed previously, Epibatidin is an alkaloid that was first isolated from the skin of the Ecuadoran frog Epipedobates tricolor and was found to have very high affinity for neuronal nicotinic receptors, where it acts as a potent agonist. It is believed that \n3\nH-epibatidin binds to two sites in rat brain, both of which have pharmacological profiles consistent with neuronal nicotinic receptors and a similar brain regional distribution (Hougling et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 48, 280-287 (1995)).\n\n\nThe high affinity binding site for \n3\nH-epibatidin is most certainly binding to the α4β2 subtype of nicotinic receptors. The identity of the low affinity site is still believed to be unknown. The inability of α-bungarotoxin to compete for \n3\nH-epibatidin binding sites may indicate that neither site measured represents the nicotinic receptor composed of α7 subunits.\n\n\nTissue preparation: Preparations may be performed at 0-4° C. unless otherwise indicated. The forebrain (÷cerebellum) from a male Wistar rat (150-250 g) may be homogenized for 10-20 sec in 20 mL Tris, HCl (50 mM, pH 7.4) using an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer. The tissue suspension may then be centrifuged at 27,000×g for 10 min. The supernatant is then discarded and the pellet may then be washed three times by centrifugation at 27,000×g for 10 min in 20 mL fresh buffer, and the final pellet may be resuspended in fresh buffer (400 mL per g of original tissue) and used for binding assays.\n\n\nAssay: Aliquots of 2.0 mL homogenate may be added to 0.100 mL of test solution and 0.100 mL of \n3\nH-epibatidin (0.3 nM, final concentration), mixed and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Non-specific binding may then be determined using (−)-nicotine (30 μM, final concentration). After incubation the samples may then be poured directly onto Whatman GF/C glass fibre filters (presoaked in 0.1% PEI for at least 20 min) under suction and immediately washed with 2×5 mL ice-cold buffer. The amount of radioactivity on the filters may be determined by conventional liquid scintillation counting.

\n\nDosages\n\n\n\nThe dosage of any compositions of the present invention will vary depending on the symptoms, age and body weight of the patient, the nature and severity of the disorder to be treated or prevented, the route of administration, and the form of the subject composition. Any of the subject formulations may be administered in a single dose or in divided doses. Dosages for the compositions of the present invention may be readily determined by techniques known to those of skill in the art or as taught herein.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the dosage of the subject compounds will generally be in the range of about 0.01 ng to about 10 g per kg body weight, specifically in the range of about 1 ng to about 0.1 g per kg, and more specifically in the range of about 100 ng to about 10 mg per kg.\n\n\nAn effective dose or amount, and any possible affects on the timing of administration of the formulation, may need to be identified for any particular composition of the present invention. This may be accomplished by routine experiment as described herein, using one or more groups of animals (preferably at least 5 animals per group), or in human trials if appropriate. The effectiveness of any subject composition and method of treatment or prevention may be assessed by administering the composition and assessing the effect of the administration by measuring one or more applicable indices, and comparing the post-treatment values of these indices to the values of the same indices prior to treatment.\n\n\nThe precise time of administration and amount of any particular subject composition that will yield the most effective treatment in a given patient will depend upon the activity, pharmacokinetics, and bioavailability of a subject composition, physiological condition of the patient (including age, sex, disease type and stage, general physical condition, responsiveness to a given dosage and type of medication), route of administration, and the like. The guidelines presented herein may be used to optimize the treatment, e.g., determining the optimum time and/or amount of administration, which will require no more than routine experimentation consisting of monitoring the subject and adjusting the dosage and/or timing.\n\n\nWhile the subject is being treated, the health of the patient may be monitored by measuring one or more of the relevant indices at predetermined times during the treatment period. Treatment, including composition, amounts, times of administration and formulation, may be optimized according to the results of such monitoring. The patient may be periodically reevaluated to determine the extent of improvement by measuring the same parameters. Adjustments to the amount(s) of subject composition ministered and possibly to the time of administration may be made based on these reevaluations.\n\n\nTreatment may be initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage may be increased by small increments until the optimum therapeutic effect is attained.\n\n\nThe use of the subject compositions may reduce the required dosage for any individual agent contained in the compositions because the onset and duration of effect of the different agents may be complimentary.\n\n\nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of subject compositions may be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD\n50 \nand the ED\n50\n.\n\n\nThe data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies may be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of any subject composition lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED\n50 \nwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For compositions of the present invention, the therapeutically effective dose may be estimated initially from cell culture assays.\n\n\nFormulation\n\n\nThe compositions of the present invention may be administered by various means, depending on their intended use, as is well known in the art. For example, if compositions of the present invention are to be administered orally, they may be formulated as tablets, capsules, granules, powders or syrups. Alternatively, formulations of the present invention may be administered parenterally as injections (intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous), drop infusion preparations or suppositories. For application by the ophthalmic mucous membrane route, compositions of the present invention may be formulated as eyedrops or eye ointments. These formulations may be prepared by conventional means, and, if desired, the compositions may be mixed with any conventional additive, such as an excipient, a binder, a disintegrating agent, a lubricant, a corrigent, a solubilizing agent, a suspension aid, an emulsifying agent or a coating agent.\n\n\nIn formulations of the subject invention, wetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants may be present in the formulated agents.\n\n\nSubject compositions may be suitable for oral, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal, aerosol and/or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of composition that may be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dose vary depending upon the subject being treated, and the particular mode of administration.\n\n\nMethods of preparing these formulations include the step of bringing into association compositions of the present invention with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association agents with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia), each containing a predetermined amount of a subject composition thereof as an active ingredient. Compositions of the present invention may also be administered as a bolus, electuary, or paste.\n\n\nIn solid dosage forms for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees, powders, granules and the like), the subject composition is mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any of the following: (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; (2) binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; (3) humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; (5) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; (6) absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; (7) wetting agents, such as, for example, acetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; (8) absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; (9) lubricants, such a talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof; and (10) coloring agents. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.\n\n\nA tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the subject composition moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Tablets, and other solid dosage forms, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art.\n\n\nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the subject composition, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\nSuspensions, in addition to the subject composition, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\nFormulations for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing a subject composition with one or more suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate, and which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the body cavity and release the active agent. Formulations which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.\n\n\nDosage forms for transdermal administration of a subject composition includes powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active component may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required.\n\n\nThe ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to a subject composition, excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof.\n\n\nPowders and sprays may contain, in addition to a subject composition, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays may additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane.\n\n\nCompositions of the present invention may alternatively be administered by aerosol. This is accomplished by preparing an aqueous aerosol, liposomal preparation or solid particles containing the compound. A non-aqueous (e.g., fluorocarbon propellant) suspension could be used. Sonic nebulizers may be used because they minimize exposing the agent to shear, which may result in degradation of the compounds contained in the subject compositions.\n\n\nOrdinarily, an aqueous aerosol is made by formulating an aqueous solution or suspension of a subject composition together with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and stabilizers. The carriers and stabilizers vary with the requirements of the particular subject composition, but typically include non-ionic surfactants (Tweens, Pluronics, or polyethylene glycol), innocuous proteins like serum albumin, sorbitan esters, oleic acid, lecithin, amino acids such as glycine, buffers, salts, sugars or sugar alcohols. Aerosols generally are prepared from isotonic solutions.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise a subject composition in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents.\n\n\nExamples of suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.\n\n\nKits\n\n\nThis invention also provides kits for conveniently and effectively implementing the methods of this invention. Such kits comprise any subject composition, and a means for facilitating compliance with methods of this invention. Such kits provide a convenient and effective means for assuring that the subject to be treated takes the appropriate active in the correct dosage in the correct manner. The compliance means of such kits includes any means which facilitates administering the actives according to a method of this invention. Such compliance means include instructions, packaging, and dispensing means, and combinations thereof. Kit components may be packaged for either manual or partially or wholly automated practice of the foregoing methods. In other embodiments involving kits, this invention contemplates a kit including compositions of the present invention, and optionally instructions for their use.\n\n\nEXEMPLIFICATION\n\n\nThe invention now being generally described, it will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples which are included merely for purposes of illustration of certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention, and are not intended to limit the invention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-2-p-tolylsulfonyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2,5-diene: A stirred mixture of p-tolylsulfonylacetylene (6 g, 33 mmol) and N-tert-butoxycarbonylpyrrole (14 g, 83 mmol) was heated under N\n2 \nat 80° C. for 36 h.
