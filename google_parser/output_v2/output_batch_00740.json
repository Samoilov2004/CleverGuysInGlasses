They have been classified into seven subfamilies: TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), TRPP (polycystin), TRPML (mucolipin), TRPA (ankyrin, ANKTM 1) and TRPN (NOMPC) families. The TRPC family can be divided into 4 subfamilies (i) TRPC 1 (ii) TRPC2 (iii) TRPC 3, TRPC6, TRPC 7 and (iv) TRPC4, TRPC 5 based on sequence functional similarities. Currently the TRPV family has 6 members. TRPV 5 and TRPV6 are more closely related to each other than to TRPV 1 , TRPV2, TRPV 3 or TRPV4. TRPAl is most closely related to TRPV 3 and is more closely related to TRPV 1 and TRPV2 than to TRPV 5 and TRPV6. The TRPM family has 8 members. Constituents include the following: the founding member TRPM1 (melastatin or LTRPC 1 ), TRPM3 ( IAA 1616 or LTRPC3), TRPM7 (TRP-PLIK, Cha ( l ), LTRPC7), TRPM6 (Cha 2), TRPM2 (TRPC 7 or LTRPC2), TRPM8 (TRP-p8 or CMR1 ), TRPM5 (MTR1 or LTRPC5) and TRPM4 (FLJ20041 or LTRPC4). The TRPML family consists of the mucolipins, which include TRPML1 (mucolipin 1 ), TRPML2 (mucolipin 2) and TRPML3 (mucolipin 3). The TRPP family consists of two groups of channels: those predicted to have six transmembrane domains and those that have eleven. TRPP2 (P JD2), TRPP3 (P D2L1 ), TRPP5 (P D2L2) are all predicted to have six transmembrane domains. TRPPl (PKDl , PC I ), PKD-REJ and PKD-l Ll are all thought to have eleven transmembrane domains. The sole mammalian member of the TRPA family is ANKTM1. \n\n It is believed TRPA l is expressed in nociceptive neurons. Nociceptive neurons of the nervous system sense the peripheral damage and transmit pain signals. TRPA l is membrane bound and most likely acts as a heterodimeric voltage gated channel. It is believed to have a particular secondary structure, its N-terminus is lined with a large number of ankyrin repeats which are believed to form a spring-like edifice.TRPA l is activated by a variety of noxious stimuli, including cold temperatures (activated at 17°C), pungent natural compounds (e.g., mustard, cinnamon and garlic) and environmental irritants (MacPherson, L. J. et al., Nature, 2007, 445; 541 -545). Noxious compounds activate TRPA l ion channels through covalent modification of cysteines to form covalently linked adducts. Variety of endogenous molecules produced during tissue inflammation / injury have been identified as pathological activators of TRPA l receptor. These include hydrogen peroxide which is produced due to oxidative stress generated during inflammation, alkenyl aldehyde 4-HNE - an intracellular lipid peroxidation product and cyclopentenone prostaglandin 15dPGJ2 which is produced from PGD2 during inflammation / allergic response. TRPAl is also activated in receptor dependant fashion by Bradykinin (B ) which is released during tissue injury at peripheral terminals\n\n\nThe difference between TRPA l and other TRP receptors is that TRPA l ligand binding persists for hours due to which the physiological response (e.g., pain) is greatly prolonged. Hence to dissociate the electrophile, an effective antagonist is required. \n\n\n WO 2009/158719, WO 2009/002933, WO 2008/0949099, WO 2007/073505, WO 2004/055054 and WO 2005/089206 describe the TRP channels as the targets for the treatment of pain and related conditions. \n\n\n In efforts to discover better analgesics for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain and to develop treatments for various neuropathic and nociceptive pain states, there exists a need for a more effective and safe therapeutic treatment of diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by TRPAl . \n\n\n Summary of the Invention \n\n\n The present invention relates to compounds of the formula (I): \n\n\n \n\n or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, \n\n\n wherein, \n\n\n R\n1\n and R\n2\n are independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, arylalkyi, heterocyclylalkyl, and - (CR\nx\nR\ny\n)\nn\nOR\nx\n;

Digestive organ diseases like irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, functional dyspepsia, constipation, diarrhea, and vomiting. The connection between therapeutic effect and inhibition of TRPAl is illustrated, for example, in Story, G. M. et al. Cell, 2003, 1 12, 819-829; McMahon, S.B. and Wood, J. N., Cell, 2006, 124, 1 123-1 125; Voorhoeve, P. M. et al. Cell, 2006, 124, 1 169-1 181 ; Wissenbach, U, Niemeyer, B. A. and Flockerzi, V. Biology of the Cell, 2004, 96, 47-54; and the references cited therein. \n\n\n Pain can be acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limiting, chronic pain persists for 3 months or longer and can lead to significant changes in a patient's personality; lifestyle, functional ability and overall quality of life ( . M. Foley, Pain, in Cecil Textbook of Medicine; J. C. Bennett & F. Plum (eds.), 20th ed., 1996, 100- 107). The sensation of pain can be triggered by any number of physical or chemical stimuli and \n\n the sensory neurons which mediate the response to this harmful stimulus are termed as \"nociceptors\". Nociceptors are primary sensory afferent (C and Αδ fibers) neurons that are activated by a wide variety of noxious stimuli including chemical, mechanical, thermal and proton (pH<6) modalities. Nociceptors are the nerves which sense and respond to parts of the body which suffer from damage. They signal tissue irritation, impending injury, or actual injury. When activated, they transmit pain signals (via the peripheral nerves as well as the spinal cord) to the brain. \n\n\n Chronic pain can be classified as either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain includes tissue injury-induced pain and inflammatory pain such as that associated with arthritis. Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the sensory nerves of the peripheral or central nervous system and is maintained by aberrant somatosensory processing. The pain is typically well localized, constant and often with an aching or throbbing quality. Visceral pain is the subtype of nociceptive pain that involves the internal organs. It tends to be episodic and poorly localized. Nociceptive pain is usually time limited, meaning when the tissue damage heals, the pain typically resolves (arthritis is a notable exception in that it is not time limited). \n\n\nGeneral Methods of Preparation \n\n\n The compounds described herein, including compounds of general formula (I) and (II), and specific examples, can be prepared by techniques known to in the art, for example, through the reaction scheme depicted in Schemes 1 -9.

Modifications to reaction conditions, for example, temperature, duration of the reaction or combinations thereof are envisioned as part of the present invention. The compounds obtained by using the general reaction scheme may be of insufficient purity. These compounds can be purified by any of the methods for purification of organic compounds known in the art, for example, crystallization or silica gel or alumina column chromatography using different solvents in suitable ratios. All possible stereoisomers are envisioned within the scope of this invention. \n\n\n A general approach for the synthesis of pyrido[3,4-i/]pyrimidinyl acetamide derivatives of the general formula (I), wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\na\n, R\nb\n, U, V, W, Y and 'p' are as defined above in description can depicted in Scheme 1. The carboxylic acid (when R is \n\n hydrogen) or its ester derivative (when R is alkyl) of the formula (1) is coupled with amine of formula (2) in presence of a suitable coupling agent (for R = H) or a suitable base such as sodium hydride (for R = alkyl) in a suitable solvent or a mixture of solvents to afford compounds of the formula (I). \n\n\n Scheme 1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA general approach for the synthesis of pyrido[3,4-c/]pyrimidinyl acetamide derivatives of the general formula (la), wherein U, V, W, Y, R\n3\n and 'p' are as defined above can depicted in Scheme 2. The known 6-methyl-l,3-dimethyluracil derivative (3) can be prepared by two different methods. In one approach N,N-dimethyl urea is condensed with acetic anhydride in presence of dry pyridine as reported by Egg, H. et al in Synthesis, 1982, 1071 -1073. Alternatively, intermediate (3) can be prepared by alkylation of 6-methyluracil according to the procedure reported by Siverman, R. B. et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1982, 104, 6434-6439. Friedel-Crafts acylation of intermediate (3) in the presence of catalytic amount of Lewis acid e.g., ZnCI\n2\n gives compounds of the formula (4) [Tsupak, E. B. et al in J. Chemistry heterocyclic compounds, 2003, 39, 953- 959]. The condensation of compounds of the formula (4) with triethylorthoformate gives compound of the formula (5). Oxidative cleavage of olefenic double in intermediate (5) using a suitable reagent such as NaI0 or NalCVOsC^ or CuCl/DMF/0\n2\n gives desired aldehyde of formula (6). The aldehyde of formula (6) can be transformed into aldehyde amine of the formula (7) in three steps. Cyclisation of aldehyde amine (7) gives desired pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine-5-one of the formula (8). The aromatization of compound (8) using phosphorous oxyhalide such as phosphorous oxychloride or phosphorous oxybromide in dry toluene in the presence of suitable base such as N,N-dimethyl aniline gives compounds of halo pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidine of the formula (9). Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of halo compound (9) with allylboronic acid ester followed by oxidative cleavage can give corresponding pyrido[3,4-i/]pyrimidinyl acetic acid of the formula ( Γ) [ otha et al., in Synlett, (2005), 12, 1877-1890 and Sharpless, . B. et al. in J. Org. Chem., ( 1981 ), 3936-3938]. The coupling of compounds of formula ( Γ) with amines of \n\n formula (2) by using a standard amide coupling method can give compounds of general formula (la). \n\n\n Scheme 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In another approach pyrido[3,4-i/]pyrimidinyl acetamide derivatives of the general formula (la), wherein U, V, W, Y, R\n3\n and 'p' are as defined above, can be prepared from a pyridine derivative as depicted in Scheme 3. Thus, commercially available 3,5- dibromopridine-4-carbaldehyde of the formula (10) is converted to the corresponding nitrile of formula (1 1) by a known approach using ammonia in the presence of iodine. Selective displacement of bromo compound (1 1) with methyl amine hydrochloride in the presence of suitable base gives compounds of the formula (12). The nitrile of formula ( 12) is converted to the corresponding amide of the formula (13) by using standard procedure as reported in the literature. Cyclisation of compounds of the formula ( 13) with triphosgene or carbonyl dimidazole in the presence of suitable solvent gives the compounds of the formula (14), which on selective N-alkylation afforded compounds of the formula ( 15). Aryl bromide of formula (15) on reaction with allylboronic acid pinacol ester of the formula ( 16) in the presence of Pd(0) catalyst gives ally! pyrido[3,4- i ]pyrimidinedione of the formula (17). Oxidative cleavage of the terminal olefinic bond of intermediate ( 17) using sodium metaperiodate in the presence of catalytic amounts of ruthenium (III) chloride (Sharpless, . B. et al. in J. Org. Chem., (1981 ), 3936-3938) can give the desired pyrido[3,4-</|pyrimidinyl acetic acid derivative of the formula ( Γ). The \n\n coupling of compounds of formula ( ) with amines of formula (2) by using a standard amide coupling method can give compounds of general formula (la). \n\n\n Scheme 3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Another approach for the synthesis of for the synthesis of pyrido[3,4- c/]pyrimidinyl acetamide derivatives of the general formula (la), wherein U, V, W, Y, R\n3\n and 'p' are as defined above can be depicted in Scheme 4. Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of bromo compound (13) with allylboronic acid ester (16) in the presence of Pd(0) catalyst gives allyl compounds of the formula (18). Cyclisation of compounds of the formula (18) with triphosgene gives compounds of the formula ( 19). The selective N-methylation of (19) gives compounds of the formula (17). Oxidative cleavage of the terminal olefinic bond of intermediate ( 17) using sodium metaperiodate in the presence of catalytic amounts of ruthenium (III) chloride can give the desired pyrido[3,4-i/]pyrimidinyl acetic acid of the formula ( ). The coupling of compounds of formula ( Γ) with amines of formula (2) by using a standard amide coupling method gives compounds of general formula (la). \n\n\nScheme 4 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n An alternative approach for the synthesis of pyrido[3,4-c/)pyrimidinyl acetamides of general formula (la) is shown in Scheme 5. Thus, reaction of 5-bromo pyrido[3,4- ] pyrimidinedione (15) with dialkyl malonate of the formula (20) in the presence of suitable base such as sodium hydride in suitable solvent such as dry DMSO gives the adduct (21) which on dealkoxycarboxylation using suitable base gives pyrido[3,4- i/]pyrimidinyl ester of the formula (22). A similar approach is reported by Koomen, G. J. et al Tetrahedron ( 1985), 41, 1893-1904. The coupling reaction of ethyl pyrido[3,4- i/]pyrimidinyl acetate of the formula (22) with amine of the formula (2) mediated by a suitable base such as sodium hydride in the presence of a suitable solvent such as toluene or xylene affords compounds of the general formula (la). \n\n\n Scheme 5 oxylation \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Another approach for the synthesis of pyrido[3,4-i/]pyrimidinyl acetamides of general formula (la) is shown in Scheme 6. Thus, reaction of 6-methyl-l,3-dimethyluracil of general formula (3) with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal of formula (23) in the presence of a suitable solvent (DMF) affords enamine of general formula (24). The compound of general formula (24) on oxidative cleavage of aliphatic olefinic bond using sodium periodate in presence of a suitable solvent gives formyl uracil of general formula \n\n (25). Condensation of compound of formula (25) with aminoacetaldehyde dimethylacetal of formula (26) gives intermediate of general formula (27). Reaction of compound of formula (27) with glyoxylic acid under acidic conditions, preferably con. HCI, followed by esterification affords ethyl pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidinyl acetate of the formula (22). A similar approach is reported by Walter, J. G. et al. in J. Org. Chem., (40), 733-739, 1975. The coupling reaction of ethyl pyrido[3,4-i/jpyrimidinyl acetate of the formula (22) with amine of the formula (2) using suitable base such as sodium hydride in presence of a suitable solvent such as toluene or xylene affords compounds of the general formula (la). \n\n\nScheme 6 \n\n\n\n\n\n(3) (23) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 7 depicts synthesis of 2-amino-4-arylthiazoles of the formula (34) from aryl alkyl ketone of the formula (33) using known approaches. Certain di-and tri- substituted aryl alkyl ketone were not commercially available and they were prepared from the corresponding benzoic acid derivative of formula (29) in three steps. Thus, acid of formula (29) was converted to the corresponding acid chloride of formula (30) using oxalyl chloride in the presence of catalytic amounts of DMF in dry dichloromethane. The acid chloride of formula (30) was converted to corresponding Weinerb amide of formula (32) by treating with N,0-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride of formula (31) in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine. The addition of methyl magnesium iodide to Weinreb amide of formula (32) afforded aryl alkyl ketone derivative of formula (33). \n\n Conversion of aryl alkyl ketone derivative of formula (33) to 2-amino-4- substituted arylthiazole of the formula (34) can be effected by two approaches as described in Scheme 7. In the first case aryl alkyl ketone was converted to the corresponding a-bromo ketone, which in turn was reacted with thiourea in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at refluxing condition. Alternatively, aryl alkyl ketone derivative of formula (33) can be converted to 2-amino-4-aryl thiazole (34) in one step by its reaction with thiourea and iodine in refluxing ethanol (Carroll, K. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1950, 3722 and Naik, S. J.; Halkar, U. P., ARKIVOC 2005, xiii, 141 -149). \n\n\n Scheme 7 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n R\nc\nCH\n2\nMgl ether \n\n\n (34) thiourea, l\n2\n EtOH \n\n\n5-Amino- 3-aryloxadiazoles of the formula (38) were prepared as shown in Scheme 8. The reaction of aryl nitrile of the formula (35) with dry ethanol in presence of dry HCl gas in dry diethyl ether gives imido ester hydrochloride of formula (36). The cyclisation of imido ester hydrochloride (36) using cyanamide and hydroxyl amine hydrochloride in presence of a suitable solvent gives desired oxadiazole amine of the formula (38). \n\n\n Scheme 8 se, solvent \n\n\n\n\n\n (37) OS) \n\n 3-Amino-l-arylpyrazoles of the formula (41) were prepared as shown in Scheme 9.

Life Sciences, 2003, 73, 487-498. (b) McNamara C, R. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 2007, 104, 13525- 13530. The screening of the compounds can be carried out by other methods and procedures known to persons skilled in the art. \n\n\n Screening for TRPA l antagonist using the \n4¾\nCalcium uptake assay: \n\n\n The inhibition of TRPAl receptor activation was measured as inhibition of ally 1 isothiocyanate (AITC) induced cellular uptake of radioactive calcium. \n\n\n Test compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO to prepare 10 mM stock and then diluted using plain medium with 0.1% BSA and 1.8 mM CaCl\n2\n to get the desired concentration. The final concentration of DMSO in the reaction was 0.5% (v/v). Human TRPA l expressing CHO cells were grown in F- 12 DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 400 / ml of G-418. Rat TRPA l expressing CHO cells were grown in F-12 DMEM medium with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and 400 μg / ml of Zeocin. Cells were seeded 24 h prior to the assay in 96 well plates so as to get ~ 50,000 cells per well on the day of experiment. Cells were treated with the test compounds for 10 minutes followed by the addition of AITC at a final concentration of 30 μΜ (for human TRPAl) and / or 10 μΜ (for rat TRPAl) and 5 μθι\n'\n/πιΐ \n45\nCa\n+2\n for 3 minutes. Cells were washed and lysed using a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 % deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS. Radioactivity in the lysate was measured in a Packard TopCount after addition of liquid scintillant. (Toth et al, Life Sciences (2003) 73, 487-498; McNamara CR et al, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, (2007) 104 , 13525-13530). \n\n\n Concentration response curves were plotted as a % of maximal response obtained in the absence of test antagonist. ICs\n0\n values can be calculated from concentration response curve by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad PRISM software. \n\n\n The compounds prepared were tested using the above assay procedure and the results obtained are given in Table 2. Percentage inhibition at concentrations of 1.0 μΜ and 10.0 μΜ are given in the table along with IC50 (nM) details for selected examples. The IC50 (nM) values of the compounds are set forth in Table 3 wherein \"A\" refers to an IC\n50\n value of less than 50 nM, \"B\" refers to IC\n50\n value in range of 50.01 to 100.0 nM and \"C\" refers to IC\n50\n value of more than 100.0 nM \n\n Table 2: In-vitro screening results of compounds of invention"
