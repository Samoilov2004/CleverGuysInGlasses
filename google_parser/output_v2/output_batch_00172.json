Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. \nField of the Invention\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds, compositions comprising a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound and methods for preventing or treating pain or diarrhea in an animal comprising administering to an animal in need of such prevention or treatment an effective amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound.\n\n\n \n\n\n2. \nBackground of the Invention\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPain is the most common symptom for which patients seek medical advice and treatment. Pain can be acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limited, chronic pain can persist for 3 months or longer and lead to significant changes in a patient's personality, lifestyle, functional ability or overall quality of life (\nK.M. Foley, Pain, in Cecil Textbook of medicine 100-107, J.C. Bennett and F. Plum eds., 20th ed. 1996\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPain has been traditionally managed by administering a non-opioid analgesic, such as acetylsalicylic acid, choline magnesium trisalicylate, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, fenoprofen, diflusinal and naproxen; or an opioid analgesic, such as morphine, hydromorphone, methadone, levorphanol, fentanyl, oxycodone and oxymorphone. \nId.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnited States Patent No. \n \n6,576,650 B1\n \n, United States Patent \n \n6,166,039\n \n, and United States Patent No. \n \n5,849,761, to Yaksh \n \nand United States Patent No. \n \n6,573,282, to Yaksh et al\n \n \n.\n describe 1,4-substituted piperidine derivatives allegedly useful as peripherally active anti hyperalgesic opiates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnited States Patent No. \n \n6,362,203 B1 to Mogi et al.\n \n describes 4-hydroxy-4-phenylpiperidine derivatives that are alleged to exhibit peripheral analgesic action.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCanadian Patent Publication No. \n \n949560 of Carron et al.\n \n describes piperidine derivatives bearing substituents at the 1 and 4 positions that are alleged to be useful as analgesics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternational Publication No. \n \nWO 02/38185 A2 of Dunn et al.\n \n describes 1,4 substituted piperidine compounds that are allegedly useful as an antihyperalgesic opiate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Abstract of International Publication No. \n \nWO 01/70689 A1\n \n also discloses piperidine derivatives carrying substituents at the 1 and 4 positions that are allegedly useful as opioid δ receptor agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTraditional opioid analgesics exert their pharmacological activity once they have passed through the blood-brain barrier. But this passage through the blood-brain barrier can lead to undesirable central nervous system-mediated side effects, such as respiratory depression, increased drug tolerance, increased drug dependence, constipation and unwanted euphoria.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere remains a clear need for new drugs that are useful for treating or preventing pain or diarrhea and that reduce or avoid one or more side effects associated with traditional therapy for treating pain or diarrhea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCitation of any reference in Section 2 of this application is not an admission that such reference is prior art to the present application.\n\n\n \n\n\n3. \nSummary of the Invention\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses compounds having the formula (I):\n\n \n \n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAr\n1\n is -C\n3\n-C\n8\n cycloalkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl or -(5- to 7-membered) heteroaryl, each being unsubstituted or substituted with one, two, or three R\n2\n groups;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAr\n2\n is phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl or -(5- to 7-membered) heteroaryl, each being unsubstituted or substituted with one, two, or three R\n2\n groups;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAr\n4\n is -C\n3\n-C\n8\n cycloalkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl or -(5- to 7-membered) heteroaryl, each being unsubstituted or substituted with one, two, or three R\n2\n groups;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG is -H, -C(O)(CH\n2\n)\nn\nCO\n2\nR\n4\n, -C(O)(CH\n2\n)\nn\nR\n5\n, -(C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkylene)CO\n2\nR\n4\n, or -(C\n1\n-C\n5\n alkylene)R\n5\n;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1\n = -H, -C(O)NH\n2\n, -C(O)NHOH, -CO\n2\nR\n4\n, -CHO, -CN, -(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -C(O)NH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -C(O)N(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)\n2\n, -CF\n3\n, -CHF\n2\n, -CH\n2\nF,\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n2\n and R\n3\n are each independently -halogen, -C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl, -O(C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl), -NH(C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl), -N(C\n1\n-C\n3\n alkyl)\n2\n, -CF\n3\n, or -OCF\n3\n ;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n4\n = -H, -C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl, -CH\n2\nO(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -CH\n2\nN(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)\n2\n, or -CH\n2\nNH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl);\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n5\n = -NH\n2\n, -NHSO\n2\nR\n4\n, -C(O)NH\n2\n, -C(O)NHOH, - SO\n2\nNH\n2\n, -C(O)NH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -C(O)N(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)\n2\n, -SO\n2\nNH(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl), -SO\n2\nN(C\n1\n-C\n4\n alkyl)\n2\n, -H, -OH, -CN, or -C\n3\n-C\n8\n cycloalkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl, -(5- to 7-membered) heteroaryl each C\n3\n-C\n8\n cycloalkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl, phenanthryl, -(5- to 7-membered) heteroaryl being unsubstituted or substituted with one or more R\n2\n groups;\n\nm = an integer ranging from 0 to 4;\n\nn = an integer ranging from 1 to 4;\n\np = 0 or 1;

Accordingly, the invention also encompasses 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds and their uses as described herein in the form of their individual stereoisomer or tautomers. In addition, one or more hydrogen, carbon or other atoms of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound can be replaced by an isotope of the hydrogen, carbon or other atoms, respectively. Such compounds, which are encompassed by the present invention, are useful as research and diagnostic tools in metabolic pharmacokinetic studies and in binding assays.\n\n\n \n\n\n4.4 \nTherapeutic Uses of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the invention, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are administered to an animal, in one embodiment a mammal, in another embodiment a human, for the treatment or prevention of pain. The 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used to treat or prevent acute or chronic pain. For example, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used for, but are not limited to, treating or preventing cancer pain, central pain, labor pain, myocardial infarction pain, pancreatic pain, colic pain, post operative pain, headache pain, muscle pain, and pain associated with intensive care.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can also be used for inhibiting, preventing, or treating pain associated with inflammation or with an inflammatory disease in an animal. The pain to be inhibited, treated or prevented may be associated with inflammation associated with an inflammatory disease, which can arise where there is an inflammation of the body tissue, and which can be a local inflammatory response and/or a systemic inflammation. For example, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used to inhibit, treat, or prevent pain associated with inflammatory diseases including, but not limited to: organ transplant rejection; reoxygenation injury resulting from organ transplantation (see \nGrupp et al. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 31:297 303 (1999\n)) including, but not limited to, transplantation of the heart, lung, liver, or kidney; chronic inflammatory diseases of the joints, including arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and bone diseases associated with increased bone resorption; inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ileitis, ulcerative colitis, Barrett's syndrome, and Crohn's disease; inflammatory lung diseases, such as asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and chronic obstructive airway disease; inflammatory diseases of the eye, including corneal dystrophy, trachoma, onchocerciasis, uveitis, sympathetic ophthalmitis and endophthalmitis; chronic inflammatory diseases of the gum, including gingivitis and periodontitis; tuberculosis; leprosy; inflammatory diseases of the kidney, including uremic complications, glomerulonephritis and nephrosis; inflammatory diseases of the skin, including sclerodermatitis, psoriasis and eczema; inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, including chronic demyelinating diseases of the nervous system, multiple sclerosis, AIDS-related neurodegeneration and Alzheimer s disease, infectious meningitis, encephalomyelitis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and viral or autoimmune encephalitis; autoimmune diseases, including Type I and Type II diabetes mellitus; diabetic complications, including, but not limited to, diabetic cataract, glaucoma, retinopathy, nephropathy (such as microaluminuria and progressive diabetic nephropathy), polyneuropathy, mononeuropathies, autonomic neuropathy, gangrene of the feet, atherosclerotic coronary arterial disease, peripheral arterial disease, nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar coma, foot ulcers, joint problems, and a skin or mucous membrane complication (such as an infection, a shin spot, a candidal infection or necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum); immune-complex vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); inflammatory diseases of the heart, such as cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease hypercholesterolemia, and atherosclerosis; as well as various other diseases that can have significant inflammatory components, including preeclampsia, chronic liver failure, brain and spinal cord trauma, and cancer. The 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can also be used for inhibiting, treating, or preventing pain associated with inflammatory disease that can, for example, be a systemic inflammation of the body, exemplified by gram-positive or gram negative shock, hemorrhagic or anaphylactic shock, or shock induced by cancer chemotherapy in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., shock associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Such shock can be induced, e.g., by a chemotherapeutic agent that is adminstered as a treatment for cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are administered to an animal, in one embodiment a mammal, in another embodiment a human, for the treatment or prevention of diarrhea. The 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used to treat or prevent acute or chronic diarrhea. For example, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used for, but are not limited to, treating or preventing acute diarrhea caused by a virus, such as but not limited to Norwalk-virus, Norwalk-like virus, Rotavirus, and Cytomegaloviurs: protozoa, such as but not limited to \nGirardia lamlia, Crpytosporidium\n and \nEntamoeba histolytica\n; and bacteria, including but not limited to \nStapylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens,\n enterotoxigenic \nE. coli, Vibrio cholera,\n enterohemmorrhagic \nE. coli\n O157:H5, \nVibrio parahaemolyticus, Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella,\n enteroinvasive \nE. coli, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Yersinia enterocolitica, Chlamydia, Nisseria gonorrhoeae,\n and \nListeria monocytogenes.\n For example, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be used for treating or preventing chronic diarrhea classified as including, but not limited to, osmotic diarrhea, secretory diarrhea, or resulting from an inflammatory condition, a malabsorption syndrome, a motility disorder, and a chronic infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present inventor believes that unlike traditional opioid agonists and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds do not significantly cross the blood-brain barrier. Accordingly, the administration of an effective amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound to an animal should result in fewer side effects, including, for example, respiratory depression, unwanted euphoria, sedation, increased drug tolerance, and increased drug dependence, that can result from the administration of traditional opioid agonists or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. In one embodiment, the administration of an effective amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound to an animal results in none of the aforementioned side effects. Therefore, in certain embodiments, the present methods encompass treating or preventing pain, while reducing or eliminating one or more of the aforementioned side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are agonists for and, accordingly, are capable of stimulating an opioid receptor. In one embodiment, the opiod receptor is a µ receptor. In another embodiment, the opioid receptor is an ORL-1 receptor. In a further embodiment, the opioid receptor is a δ-opioid receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to methods for stimulating opioid-receptor function in a cell comprising contacting a cell capable of expressing an opioid receptor with an effective amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound. The method is also useful for stimulating opioid receptor function in a cell \nin vivo,\n in an animal, in one embodiment a human, by contacting a cell capable of expressing an opioid receptor, in an animal, with an effective amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound. In one embodiment, the method is useful for treating or preventing pain or diarrhea in an animal. Brain tissue, spinal chord tissue, immune cells, cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and primary afferent nerve cells are examples of tissues and/or cells that are capable of expressing an opioid receptor. This method can be used \nin vitro,\n for example, as an assay to select cells that express an opioid receptor.\n\n\n \n\n\n4.4.1 \nTherapeutic/Prophylactic Administration and Compositions of the Invention\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDue to their activity, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are advantageously useful in veterinary and human medicine. As described above, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-pipefidine Compounds are useful for treating or preventing pain or diarrhea in an animal in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen administered to an animal, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-pipefidine Compounds can be administered as a component of a pharmaceutical composition that comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The present compositions, which comprise a 4-Oxadiazolyi-pipefidine Compound, are in one embodiment administered orally. The compositions of the invention can also be adapted for and administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal, and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and can be administered alone or together with another therapeutic agent. Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, \ne.g\n., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, capsules, \netc\n., and can be used to administer the 4-Oxadiazolyl-pipefidine Compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of administration include but are not limited to intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectal, by inhalation, or topical, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The mode of administration is left to the discretion of the practitioner. In most instances, administration will result in the release of a therapeutically effective amount of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-pipefidine Compounds into the bloodstream.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn specific embodiments, it may be desirable to administer the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds locally. This may be achieved, for example, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes; or fibers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent, or via perfusion in a fluorocarbon or synthetic pulmonary surfactant. In certain embodiments, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and excipients such as triglycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the 4-Oxadiazolyi-piperidine Compounds can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see \nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n) and \nTreat et al., Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer 317-327 and 353-365 (1989\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be delivered in a controlled-release system (\nsee, e.g.,\n \nGoodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984\n)). Other controlled release systems discussed in the review by \nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n) may be used. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (\nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n); \nSefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987\n); \nBuchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980\n); and \nSaudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989\n)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (\nsee\n \nMedical Applications of Controlled Release (Langer and Wise eds., 1974\n); \nControlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance (Smolen and Ball eds., 1984\n); \nRanger and Peppas, J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61 (1983\n); \nLevy et al., Science 228:190 (1985\n); \nDuring et al., Ann. Neurol. 25:351 (1989\n); and \nHoward et al., J. Neurosurg. 71:105 (1989\n)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of a target of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose. In further embodiments, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be administered by controlled-release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in \n \nU.S. Patent Nos.: 3,845,770\n \n; \n \n3,916,899\n \n; \n \n3,536,809\n \n; \n \n3,598,123\n \n; \n \n4,008,719\n \n; \n \n5,674,533\n \n; \n \n5,059,595\n \n; \n \n5,591,767\n \n; \n \n5,120,548\n \n; \n \n5,073,543\n \n; \n \n5,639,476\n \n; \n \n5,354,556\n \n; and \n \n5,733,566\n \n, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds. The invention thus encompasses single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present compositions can optionally comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient so as to provide the form for proper administration to the animal. Such pharmaceutical excipients can be liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. The pharmaceutical excipients can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating, and coloring agents may be used. When administered to an animal, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are preferably sterile. Water is a particularly useful excipient when the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid excipients, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients also include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The present compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients for intravenous administration of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds include, but are not limited to, normal (about 0.9%) saline, about 25 to about 30% polyethylene glycol (\"PEG\") diluted with saline or water, and about 2 to about 30% hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin diluted with water. In one embodiment, compositions for intravenous administration comprise the compound dissolved in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions may also include a solubilizing agent. Compositions for intravenous administration can optionally include a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water-free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are to be administered by infusion, they can be dispensed, for example, from an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients for intraperitoneal administration of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-pipefidine Compounds include, but are not limited to, normal (about 0.9%) saline, about 25 to about 30% PEG diluted with saline or water, about 25 to about 30% propylene glycol (PG) diluted with saline or water, and about 2 to about 30% hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin diluted with water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients for subcutaneous and intramuscular administration of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds include, but are not limited to, water, normal (about 0.9%) saline, about 25 to about 30% PEG diluted with saline or water, and about 25 to about 30% PG diluted with saline or water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients for oral administration of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-pipefidine Compounds include, but are not limited to, water, normal (about 0.9%) saline, about 25 to about 30% polyethylene glycol PEG diluted with saline or water, about 2 to about 30% hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin diluted with water, about 25 to about 30% PG diluted with saline or water, and about 1 to about 5% methylcellulose diluted with water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients for intracerebroventricular and intrathecal administration of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds include, but are not limited to, normal (about 0.9%) saline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained release formulations, suppositories, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the composition is in the form of a capsule (\nsee e.g.,\n \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,698,155\n \n). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical excipients are described in\n Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., 19th ed. 1995\n), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a composition adapted for oral administration to an animal, particularly a human being. Compositions for oral delivery may be in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs, for example. Orally administered compositions can contain preserving agents, coloring agents, and one or more agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin and flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated or otherwise formulated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In these later platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate-release formulations. A time delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate may also be used. Oral compositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose and magnesium carbonate. In one embodiment, such excipients are of pharmaceutical grade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nControlled release pharmaceutical compositions can have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled counterparts. In one embodiment a controlled-release composition comprises a minimal amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled release compositions include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled release compositions can favorably affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound, and can thus reduce the occurrence of adverse side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, controlled release compositions can initially release an amount of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound that promptly treats or prevents pain or diarrhea, and then gradually and continually release another amount of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. To maintain this constant level of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound in the body, the 4-Oxadiazolyi-pipefidine Compound can be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions including, but not limited to, changes in pH, changes in temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or availability of water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds that is effective in the treatment or prevention of pain or diarrhea can depend on the nature or severity of the disorder or condition causing the pain and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal effective dosage amounts. The precise dose to be employed can also depend on the intended route of administration, and the degree or severity of the pain or diarrhea and can be determined according to the judgment of the medical practitioner in view of each patient's circumstances and published clinical studies. Suitable effective dosage amounts can range from about 10 micrograms to about 2500 milligrams about every 4 h, although typically about 100 mg or less. In one-embodiment, the effective dosage amount ranges from about 0.01 milligrams to about 100 milligrams of a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound about every 4 h, in another embodiment about 0.020 milligrams to about 50 milligrams about every 4 h, and in another embodiment about 0.025 milligrams to about 20 milligrams about every 4 h. The dosage amounts described herein refer to total amounts administered; that is, if more than one 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound is administered, the effective dosage amounts correspond to the total amount administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere a cell capable of expressing an opioid receptor is contacted with a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound \nin vitro,\n the effective amount for opioid receptor function stimulation will typically range from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg/L, in one embodiment from about 0.1 mg to about 50 mg/L, and in another embodiment from about 1 mg to about 20 mg/L, of a solution or suspension of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In one embodiment, the opiod receptor is a µ receptor. In another embodiment, the opiod receptor is an ORL-1 receptor. In a further embodiment, the opioid receptor is a δ-opioid receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere a cell capable of expressing an opioid receptor is contacted with a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound \nin vivo,\n the effective amount for opioid receptor function stimulation will typically range from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, in one embodiment from about 0.1 mg to about 50 mg/kg body weight per day, and in another embodiment from about 1 mg to about 20 mg/kg of body weight per day. In one embodiment, the opiod receptor is a µ receptor. In another embodiment, the opiod receptor is an ORL-1 receptor. In a further embodiment, the opioid receptor is a δ-opioid receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds can be assayed \nin vitro\n or \nin vivo\n for their ability to treat or prevent pain or diarrhea prior to use in humans. Animal model systems can be used to demonstrate the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compounds' safety or efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present methods for treating or preventing pain or diarrhea in an animal can further comprise administering to the animal an effective amount a 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound in combination with an effective amount of another therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present methods for stimulating opioid-receptor function in a cell can further comprise contacting the cell with an effective amount of another therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of other therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, an opioid agonist, a non-opioid analgesic, a non-steroid antiinflammatory agent, an antimigraine agent, a Cox-II inhibitor, an antiemetic, a β-adrenergic blocker, an anticonvulsant, an antidepressant, a Ca\n2+\n -channel blocker, an anticancer agent, an anti-anxiety agent, an agent for treating or preventing an addictive disorder and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffective amounts of the other therapeutic agents are well known to those skilled in the art. However, it is well within the skilled artisan's purview to determine the other therapeutic agent's optimal effective-amount range. In one embodiment of the invention, where another therapeutic agent is administered to an animal, the effective amount of the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound is less than its effective amount would be where the other therapeutic agent is not administered. In this case, without being bound by theory, it is believed that the 4-Oxadiazolyl-piperidine Compound and the other therapeutic agent act synergistically to treat or prevent pain or diarrhea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of useful opioid agonists include, but are not limited to, alfentanil, allylprodine, alphaprodine, anileridine, benzylmorphine, bezitramide, buprenorphine, butorphanol, clonitazene, codeine, desomorphine, dextromoramide, dezocine, diampromide, diamorphone, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, dimenoxadol, dimepheptanol, dimethylthiambutene, dioxaphetyl butyrate, dipipanone, eptazocine, ethoheptazine, ethylmethylthiambutene, ethylmorphine, etonitazene fentanyl, heroin, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, hydroxypethidine, isomethadone, ketobemidone, levorphanol, levophenacylmorphan, lofentanil, meperidine, meptazinol, metazocine, methadone, metopon, morphine, myrophine, nalbuphine, narceine, nicomorphine, norlevorphanol, normethadone, nalorphine, normorphine, norpipanone, opium, oxycodone, oxymorphone, papaveretum, pentazocine, phenadoxone, phenomorphan, phenazocine, phenoperidine, piminodine, piritramide, proheptazine, promedol, properidine, propiram, propoxyphene, sufentanil, tilidine, tramadol, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the opioid agonist is selected from codeine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, morphine, tramadol, oxymorphone, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of useful non-opioid analgesics include non steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, benoxaprofen, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, flubufen, ketoprofen, indoprofen, piroprofen, carprofen, oxaprozin, pramoprofen, muroprofen, trioxaprofen, suprofen, aminoprofen, tiaprofenic acid, fluprofen, bucloxic acid, indomethacin, sulindac, tolmetin, zomepirac, tiopinac, zidometacin, acemetacin, fentiazac, clidanac, oxpinac, mefenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, flufenamic acid, niflumic acid, tolfenamic acid, diflurisal, flufenisal, piroxicam, sudoxicam, isoxicam, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and mixtures thereof.

No. 61/130,776, filed June 3, 2008 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/132,951 , filed June 24, 2008, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to multivalent and multispecific binding proteins, methods of making, and specifically to their uses in the, diagnosis, prevention and/or treatment of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer, and other diseases.\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\nEngineered proteins, such as multispecific antibodies capable of binding two or more antigens are known in the art. Such multispecific binding proteins can be generated using cell fusion, chemical conjugation, or recombinant DNA techniques.\n\n\nBispecific antibodies have been produced using quadroma technology (see Milstein, C. and A.C. Cuello (1983) Nature 305(5934):537-40) based on the somatic fusion of two different hybridoma cell lines expressing murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with the desired specificities of the bispecific antibody. Because of the random pairing of two different immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy and light chains within the resulting hybrid-hybridoma (or quadroma) cell line, up to ten different Ig species are generated, of which only one is the functional bispecific antibody. The presence of mis-paired by-products, and significantly reduced production yields, means sophisticated purification procedures are required.\n\n\nBispecific antibodies can also be produced by chemical conjugation of two different mAbs (see Staerz, U.D., et al. (1985) Nature 314(6012): 628-31). This approach does not yield homogeneous preparation. Other approaches have used chemical conjugation of two different mAbs or smaller antibody fragments (see Brennan, M., et al. (1985) Science 229(4708): 81-3).\n\n\nAnother method used to produce bispecific antibodies is the coupling of two parental antibodies with a hetero-bifunctional crosslinker, but the resulting bispecific antibodies suffer from significant molecular heterogeneity because reaction of the crosslinker with the parental antibodies is not site-directed. To obtain more homogeneous preparations of bispecific antibodies two different Fab fragments have been chemically crosslinked at their hinge cysteine residues in a \n\n site-directed manner (see Glennie, MJ., et al. (1987) J. Immunol. 139(7): 2367-75). But this method results in Fab'2 fragments, not full IgG molecule.\n\n\nA wide variety of other recombinant bispecific antibody formats have been developed (see Kriangkum, J., et al. (2001) Biomol. Eng. 18(2): 31-40). Amongst them tandem single-chain Fv molecules and diabodies, and various derivatives thereof, are the most widely used. Routinely, construction of these molecules starts from two single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments that recognize different antigens (see Economides, A.N., et al. (2003) Nat. Med. 9(1): 47-52). Tandem scFv molecules (taFv) represent a straightforward format simply connecting the two scFv molecules with an additional peptide linker. The two scFv fragments present in these tandem scFv molecules form separate folding entities. Various linkers can be used to connect the two scFv fragments and linkers with a length of up to 63 residues (see Nakanishi, K., et al. (2001) Ann. Rev. Immunol. 19: 423-74). Although the parental scFv fragments can normally be expressed in soluble form in bacteria, it is, however, often observed that tandem scFv molecules form insoluble aggregates in bacteria. Hence, refolding protocols or the use of mammalian expression systems are routinely applied to produce soluble tandem scFv molecules. In a recent study, in vivo expression by transgenic rabbits and cattle of a tandem scFv directed against CD28 and a melanoma-associated proteoglycan was reported (see Gracie, J.A., et al. (1999) J. Clin. Invest. 104(10): 1393-401). In this construct, the two scFv molecules were connected by a CHl linker and serum concentrations of up to 100 mg/L of the bispecific antibody were found. Various strategies including variations of the domain order or using middle linkers with varying length or flexibility were employed to allow soluble expression in bacteria. A few studies have now reported expression of soluble tandem scFv molecules in bacteria (see Leung, B.P., et al. (2000) J. Immunol. 164(12): 6495-502; Ito, A., et al. (2003) J. Immunol. 170(9): 4802-9; Kami, A., et al. (2002) J. Neuroimmunol. 125(1-2): 134-40) using either a very short Ala3 linker or long glycine/serine-rich linkers. In another recent study, phage display of a tandem scFv repertoire containing randomized middle linkers with a length of 3 or 6 residues was employed to enrich for those molecules that are produced in soluble and active form in bacteria. This approach resulted in the isolation of a tandem scFv molecule with a 6 amino acid residue linker (see Arndt, M. and J. Krauss (2003) Methods MoI. Biol. 207: 305-21). It is unclear whether this linker sequence represents a general solution to the soluble expression of tandem scFv molecules. Nevertheless, this study demonstrated that phage display of tandem scFv molecules in combination with directed mutagenesis is a powerful tool to enrich for these molecules, which can be expressed in bacteria in an active form.\n\n\nBispecific diabodies (Db) utilize the diabody format for expression. Diabodies are produced from scFv fragments by reducing the length of the linker connecting the VH and VL \n\n domain to approximately 5 residues (see Peipp, M. and T. Valerius (2002) Biochem. Soc. Trans. 30(4): 507-11). This reduction of linker size facilitates dimerization of two polypeptide chains by crossover pairing of the VH and VL domains. Bispecific diabodies are produced by expressing, two polypeptide chains with, either the structure VHA-VLB and VHB-VLA (VH-VL configuration), or VLA-VHB and VLB-VHA (VL-VH configuration) within the same cell. A large variety of different bispecific diabodies have been produced in the past and most of them are expressed in soluble form in bacteria. However, a recent comparative study demonstrates that the orientation of the variable domains can influence expression and formation of active binding sites (see Mack, M. et al.(1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A 92(15): 7021-5). Nevertheless, soluble expression in bacteria represents an important advantage over tandem scFv molecules. However, since two different polypeptide chains are expressed within a single cell inactive homodimers can be produced together with active heterodimers. This necessitates the implementation of additional purification steps in order to obtain homogenous preparations of bispecific diabodies. One approach to force the generation of bispecific diabodies is the production of knob-into-hole diabodies (see Holliger, P., T. Prospero, and G. Winter (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A 90(14): 6444-8.18). This approach was demonstrated for a bispecific diabody directed against HER2 and CD3. A large knob was introduced in the VH domain by exchanging Val37 with Phe and Leu45 with Trp and a complementary hole was produced in the VL domain by mutating Phe98 to Met and Tyr87 to Ala, either in the anti- HER2 or the anti-CD3 variable domains. By using this approach the production of bispecific diabodies could be increased from 72% by the parental diabody to over 90% by the knob-into-hole diabody. Importantly, production yields only slightly decrease as a result of these mutations. However, a reduction in antigen-binding activity was observed for several constructs. Thus, this rather elaborate approach requires the analysis of various constructs in order to identify those mutations that produce heterodimeric molecule with unaltered binding activity. In addition, such approach requires mutational modification of the immunoglobulin sequence at the constant region, thus creating non-native and non-natural form of the antibody sequence, which may result in increased immunogenicity, poor in vivo stability, as well as undesirable pharmacokinetics.\n\n\nSingle-chain diabodies (scDb) represent an alternative strategy for improving the formation of bispecific diabody-like molecules (see Holliger, P. and G. Winter (1997) Cancer\n\n\nImmunol. Immunother. 45(3-4): 128-30; Wu, A.M., et al. (1996) Immunotechnology 2(1): p. 21- 36). Bispecific single-chain diabodies are produced by connecting the two diabody-forming polypeptide chains with an additional middle linker with a length of approximately 15 amino acid residues. Consequently, all molecules with a molecular weight corresponding to monomeric single-chain diabodies (50-60 kDa) are bispecific. Several studies have demonstrated that bispecific single chain diabodies are expressed in bacteria in soluble and active form with the \n\n majority of purified molecules present as monomers (see Holliger, P. and G. Winter (1997) Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 45(3-4): 128-30; Wu, A.M., et al. (1996) Immunotechnol. 2(1): 21-36; Pluckthun, A. and P. Pack (1997) Immunotechnol. 3(2): 83-105; Ridgway, J.B., et al. (1996) Protein Engin. 9(7): 617-21). Thus, single-chain diabodies combine the advantages of tandem scFvs (all monomers are bispecific) and diabodies (soluble expression in bacteria).\n\n\nMore recently diabodies have been fused to Fc to generate more Ig-like molecules, named di-diabodies (see Lu, D., et al. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279(4): 2856-65). In addition, multivalent antibody construct comprising two Fab repeats in the heavy chain of an IgG and capable of binding four antigen molecules has been described (see WO 0177342A1, and Miller, K., et al. (2003) J. Immunol. 170(9): 4854-61).\n\n\nThere is a need in the art for improved multivalent binding proteins capable of binding two or more antigens.

Specifically, the invention relates to dual variable domain immunoglobulins (DVD-Ig), and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, as well as nucleic acids, recombinant expression vectors and host cells for making such DVD-Igs. Methods of using the DVD-Igs of the invention to detect specific antigens, either in vitro or in vivo are also encompassed by the invention. \n\n Unless otherwise defined herein, scientific and technical terms used in connection with the present invention shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. The meaning and scope of the terms should be clear, however, in the event of any latent ambiguity, definitions provided herein take precedent over any dictionary or extrinsic definition. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. In this application, the use of \"or\" means \"and/or\" unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, the use of the term \"including\", as well as other forms, such as \"includes\" and \"included\", is not limiting. Also, terms such as \"element\" or \"component\" encompass both elements and components comprising one unit and elements and components that comprise more than one subunit unless specifically stated otherwise.\n\n\nGenerally, nomenclatures used in connection with, and techniques of, cell and tissue culture, molecular biology, immunology, microbiology, genetics and protein and nucleic acid chemistry and hybridization described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. The methods and techniques of the present invention are generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification unless otherwise indicated. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are performed according to manufacturer's specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The nomenclatures used in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques are used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.\n\n\nThat the present invention may be more readily understood, select terms are defined below.\n\n\nThe term \"polypeptide\" as used herein, refers to any polymeric chain of amino acids. The terms \"peptide\" and \"protein\" are used interchangeably with the term polypeptide and also refer to a polymeric chain of amino acids. The term \"polypeptide\" encompasses native or artificial proteins, protein fragments and polypeptide analogs of a protein sequence. A polypeptide may be monomelic or polymeric. Use of \"polypeptide\" herein is intended to encompass polypeptide and fragments and variants (including fragments of variants) thereof, unless otherwise contradicted by context. For an antigenic polypeptide, a fragment of polypeptide optionally contains at least one contiguous or nonlinear epitope of polypeptide. The precise boundaries of the at least one epitope fragment can be confirmed using ordinary skill in the art. The fragment comprises at least about 5 contiguous amino acids, such as at least about 10 contiguous amino acids, at least about 15 \n\n contiguous amino acids, or at least about 20 contiguous amino acids. A variant of polypeptide is as described herein.\n\n\nThe term \"isolated protein\" or \"isolated polypeptide\" is a protein or polypeptide that by virtue of its origin or source of derivation is not associated with naturally associated components that accompany it in its native state; is substantially free of other proteins from the same species; is expressed by a cell from a different species; or does not occur in nature. Thus, a polypeptide that is chemically synthesized or synthesized in a cellular system different from the cell from which it naturally originates will be \"isolated\" from its naturally associated components. A protein may also be rendered substantially free of naturally associated components by isolation, using protein purification techniques well known in the art.\n\n\nThe term \"recovering\" as used herein, refers to the process of rendering a chemical species such as a polypeptide substantially free of naturally associated components by isolation, e.g., using protein purification techniques well known in the art.\n\n\n\"Biological activity\" as used herein, refers to any one or more inherent biological properties of a molecule (whether present naturally as found in vivo, or provided or enabled by recombinant means). Biological properties include but are not limited to binding receptor; induction of cell proliferation, inhibiting cell growth, inductions of other cytokines, induction of apoptosis, and enzymatic activity. Biological activity also includes activity of an Ig molecule.\n\n\nThe terms \"specific binding\" or \"specifically binding\", as used herein, in reference to the interaction of an antibody, a protein, or a peptide with a second chemical species, mean that the interaction is dependent upon the presence of a particular structure (e.g., an antigenic determinant or epitope) on the chemical species; for example, an antibody recognizes and binds to a specific protein structure rather than to proteins generally. If an antibody is specific for epitope \"A\", the presence of a molecule containing epitope A (or free, unlabeled A), in a reaction containing labeled \"A\" and the antibody, will reduce the amount of labeled A bound to the antibody.\n\n\nThe term \"antibody\", as used herein, broadly refers to any immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule comprised of four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains, or any functional fragment, mutant, variant, or derivation thereof, which retains the essential epitope binding features of an Ig molecule. Such mutant, variant, or derivative antibody formats are known in the art. Nonlimiting embodiments of which are discussed below.\n\n\nIn a full-length antibody, each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as HCVR or VH) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CHl, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is \n\n comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as LCVR or VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino- terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FRl, CDRl, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. Immunoglobulin molecules can be of any type (e.g., IgG, IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA and IgY), class (e.g., IgG 1, IgG2, IgG 3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2) or subclass.\n\n\nThe term \"Fc region\" is used to define the C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain, which may be generated by papain digestion of an intact antibody. The Fc region may be a native sequence Fc region or a variant Fc region. The Fc region of an immunoglobulin generally comprises two constant domains, a CH2 domain and a CH3 domain, and optionally comprises a CH4 domain. Replacements of amino acid residues in the Fc portion to alter antibody effector function are known in the art (Winter, et al. US Patent Nos 5,648,260 and 5,624,821). The Fc portion of an antibody mediates several important effector functions e.g.,cytokine induction,\n\n\nADCC, phagocytosis, complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and half-life/ clearance rate of antibody and antigen-antibody complexes. In some cases these effector functions are desirable for therapeutic antibody but in other cases might be unnecessary or even deleterious, depending on the therapeutic objectives. Certain human IgG isotypes, particularly IgGl and IgG3, mediate ADCC and CDC via binding to FcγRs and complement CIq, respectively. Neonatal Fc receptors (FcRn) are the critical components determining the circulating half-life of antibodies. In still another embodiment at least one amino acid residue is replaced in the constant region of the antibody, for example the Fc region of the antibody, such that effector functions of the antibody are altered. The dimerization of two identical heavy chains of an immunoglobulin is mediated by the dimerization of CH3 domains and is stabilized by the disulfide bonds within the hinge region (Huber et al. Nature; 264: 415-20; Thies et al 1999 J MoI Biol; 293: 67-79.). Mutation of cysteine residues within the hinge regions to prevent heavy chain-heavy chain disulfide bonds will destabilize dimeration of CH3 domains. Residues responsible for CH3 dimerization have been identified (DaIF Acqua 1998 Biochemistry 37: 9266-73.). Therefore, it is possible to generate a monovalent half-Ig. Interestingly, these monovalent half Ig molecules have been found in nature for both IgG and IgA subclasses (Seligman 1978 Ann Immunol 129: 855-70;Biewenga et al 1983 Clin Exp Immunol 51 : 395-400). The stoichiometry of FcRn: Ig Fc region has been determined to be 2:1 (West et al .2000 Biochemistry 39: 9698-708), and half Fc is sufficient for mediating FcRn binding (Kim et al 1994 Eur J Immunol; 24: 542-548.). Mutations to disrupt the dimerization of CH3 domain may not have greater adverse effect on its FcRn binding as the residues important for CH3 dimerization are located on the inner interface of CH3 b sheet \n\n structure, whereas the region responsible for FcRn binding is located on the outside interface of CH2-CH3 domains. However the half Ig molecule may have certain advantage in tissue penetration due to its smaller size than that of a regular antibody. In one embodiment at least one amino acid residue is replaced in the constant region of the binding protein of the invention, for example the Fc region, such that the dimerization of the heavy chains is disrupted, resulting in half DVD Ig molecules. The anti-inflammatory activity of IgG is dependent on sialylation of the N -linked glycan of the IgG Fc fragment. The precise glycan requirements for anti-inflammatory activity has been determined, such that an appropriate IgGl Fc fragment can be created, thereby generating a fully recombinant, sialylated IgGl Fc with greatly enhanced potency (Anthony, R.M., et al. (2008) Science 320:373-376).\n\n\nThe term \"antigen-binding portion\" of an antibody (or simply \"antibody portion\"), as used herein, refers to one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen. It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Such antibody embodiments may also be bispecific, dual specific, or multi-specific formats; specifically binding to two or more different antigens.\n\n\nExamples of binding fragments encompassed within the term \"antigen-binding portion\" of an antibody include (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CHl domains; (ii) a F(ab')2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CHl domains; (iv) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (v) a dAb fragment (Ward et al, (1989) Nature 341:544-546, Winter et al., PCT publication WO 90/05144 Al herein incorporated by reference), which comprises a single variable domain; and (vi) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR). Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are coded for by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv (scFv); see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science TAT/All-Alβ; and Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also intended to be encompassed within the term \"antigen-binding portion\" of an antibody. Other forms of single chain antibodies, such as diabodies are also encompassed. Diabodies are bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites (see e.g., Holliger, P., et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:6444-6448; Poljak, RJ., et al. (1994) Structure 2:1121-1123). Such antibody binding portions are known in the art\n\n\n(Kontermann and Dubel eds., Antibody Engineering (2001) Springer- Verlag. New York. 790 pp. \n\n (ISBN 3-540-41354-5). In addition single chain antibodies also include \"linear antibodies\" comprising a pair of tandem Fv segments (VH-CHl-VH-CHl) which, together with complementary light chain polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions (Zapata et al. Protein Eng. 8(10):1057-1062 (1995); and US Patent No. 5,641,870).\n\n\nThe term \"multivalent binding protein\" is used throughout this specification to denote a binding protein comprising two or more antigen binding sites. In an embodiment, the multivalent binding protein is engineered to have the three or more antigen binding sites, and is generally not a naturally occurring antibody. The term \"multispecific binding protein\" refers to a binding protein capable of binding two or more related or unrelated targets. Dual variable domain (DVD) binding proteins of the invention comprise two or more antigen binding sites and are tetravalent or multivalent binding proteins. DVDs may be monospecific, i.e., capable of binding one antigen or multispecific, i.e. capable of binding two or more antigens. DVD binding proteins comprising two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are referred to as DVD-Ig. Each half of a DVD-Ig comprises a heavy chain DVD polypeptide, and a light chain DVD polypeptide, and two antigen binding sites. Each binding site comprises a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain with a total of 6 CDRs involved in antigen binding per antigen binding site.\n\n\nThe term \"bispecific antibody\", as used herein, refers to full-length antibodies that are generated by quadroma technology (see Milstein, C. and A.C. Cuello, Nature, 1983. 305(5934): p. 537-40), by chemical conjugation of two different monoclonal antibodies (see Staerz, U.D., et al., Nature, 1985. 314(6012): p. 628-31), or by knob-into-hole or similar approaches which introduces mutations in the Fc region (see Holliger, P., T. Prospero, and G. Winter, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 1993. 90(14): p. 6444-8.18), resulting in multiple different immunoglobulin species of which only one is the functional bispecific antibody. By molecular function, a bispecific antibody binds one antigen (or epitope) on one of its two binding arms (one pair of HC/LC), and binds a different antigen (or epitope) on its second arm (a different pair of HC/LC). By this definition, a bispecific antibody has two distinct antigen binding arms (in both specificity and CDR sequences), and is monovalent for each antigen it binds to.\n\n\nThe term \"dual-specific antibody\", as used herein, refers to full-length antibodies that can bind two different antigens (or epitopes) in each of its two binding arms (a pair of HC/LC) (see PCT publication WO 02/02773). Accordingly a dual-specific binding protein has two identical antigen binding arms, with identical specificity and identical CDR sequences, and is bivalent for each antigen it binds to. \n\n A \"functional antigen binding site\" of a binding protein is one that is capable of binding a target antigen. The antigen binding affinity of the antigen binding site is not necessarily as strong as the parent antibody from which the antigen binding site is derived, but the ability to bind antigen must be measurable using any one of a variety of methods known for evaluating antibody binding to an antigen. Moreover, the antigen binding affinity of each of the antigen binding sites of a multivalent antibody herein need not be quantitatively the same.\n\n\nThe term \"cytokine\" is a generic term for proteins released by one cell population, which act on another cell population as intercellular mediators. Examples of such cytokines are lymphokines, monokines, and traditional polypeptide hormones. Included among the cytokines are growth hormone such as human growth hormone, N-methionyl human growth hormone, and bovine growth hormone; parathyroid hormone; thyroxine; insulin; proinsulin; relaxin; prorelaxin; glycoprotein hormones such as follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH); hepatic growth factor; fibroblast growth factor; prolactin; placental lactogen; tumor necrosis factor-alpha and - beta; mullerian-inhibiting substance; mouse gonadotropin-associated peptide; inhibin; activin; vascular endothelial growth factor; integrin; thrombopoietin (TPO); nerve growth factors such as NGF-alpha; platelet-growth factor; placental growth factor, transforming growth factors (TGFs) such as TGF- alpha and TGF-beta; insulin-like growth factor-1 and -11 ; erythropoietin (EPO); osteoinductive factors; interferons such as interferon-alpha, -beta and -gamma colony stimulating factors (CSFs) such as macrophage -CSF (M-CSF); granulocyte macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF); and granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF); interleukins (ILs) such as IL-I, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-IO, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL- 15, IL-18, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23, IL-33; a tumor necrosis factor such as TNF-alpha or TNF-beta; and other polypeptide factors including LIF and kit ligand (KL). As used herein, the term cytokine includes proteins from natural sources or from recombinant cell culture and biologically active equivalents of the native sequence cytokines.\n\n\nThe term \"linker\" is used to denote polypeptides comprising two or more amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds and are used to link one or more antigen binding portions. Such linker polypeptides are well known in the art (see e.g., Holliger, P., et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 90:6444-6448; Poljak, RJ., et al. (1994) Structure 2:1121-1123). Exemplary linkers include, but are not limited to, AKTTPKLEEGEFSEAR (SEQ ID NO: 1);\n\n\nAKTTPKLEEGEFSEARV (SEQ ID NO: 2); AKTTPKLGG (SEQ ID NO: 3); SAKTTPKLGG (SEQ ID NO: 4); SAKTTP (SEQ ID NO: 5); RADAAP (SEQ ID NO: 6); RADAAPTVS (SEQ ID NO: 7); RADAAAAGGPGS (SEQ ID NO: 8); RADAAAA(G\n4\nS)\n4\n (SEQ ID NO: 9)\n;\n SAKTTPKLEEGEFSEARV (SEQ ID NO: 10); ADAAP (SEQ ID NO: 11); ADAAPTVSIFPP (SEQ ID NO: 12); TVAAP (SEQ ID NO: 13); TVAAPSVFIFPP (SEQ ID NO: 14); QPKAAP \n\n (SEQ ID NO: 15); QPKAAPSVTLFPP (SEQ ID NO: 16); AKTTPP (SEQ ID NO: 17); AKTTPPSVTPLAP (SEQ ID NO: 18); AKTTAP (SEQ ID NO: 19); AKTT APSVYPLAP (SEQ ID NO: 20); ASTKGP (SEQ ID NO: 21); ASTKGPSVFPLAP (SEQ ID NO: 22), GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 23); GENKVEYAPALMALS (SEQ ID NO: 24); GPAKELTPLKEAKVS (SEQ ID NO: 25); and GHEAAAVMQVQYPAS (SEQ ID NO: 26).\n\n\nAn \"immunoglobulin constant domain\" refers to a heavy or light chain constant domain. Human IgG heavy chain and light chain constant domain amino acid sequences are known in the art.\n\n\nThe term \"monoclonal antibody\" or \"mAb\" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigen. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations that typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each mAb is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. The modifier \"monoclonal\" is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method.\n\n\nThe term \"human antibody\", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example in the CDRs and in particular CDR3. However, the term \"human antibody\", as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences.\n\n\nThe term \"recombinant human antibody\", as used herein, is intended to include all human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies expressed using a recombinant expression vector transfected into a host cell (described further in Section II C, below), antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library (Hoogenboom H.R. (1997) TIB Tech. 15:62-70; Azzazy H., and Highsmith W.E. (2002) Clin. Biochem. 35 :425-445; Gavilondo J.V., and Larrick J.W. (2002) BioTechniques 29:128-145; Hoogenboom H., and Chames P. (2000) Immunology Today 21 :371-378 ), antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes (see, Taylor, L. D., et al. (1992) Nucl. Acids Res. 20:6287-6295; Kellermann S-A. and Green L.L. (2002) Current Opinion in Biotechnology 13:593-597; Little M. et al. (2000) \n\n Immunology Today 21 :364-370) or antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involves splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In certain embodiments, however, such recombinant human antibodies are subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the VH and VL regions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline VH and VL sequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo.\n\n\nAn \"affinity matured\" antibody is an antibody with one or more alterations in one or more\n\n\nCDRs thereof which result an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen, compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration(s). Exemplary affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. BidlTechnology 10:779-783 (1992) describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and/or framework residues is described by: Barbas et al. Proc Nat. Acad. Sci, USA 91 :3809-3813 (1994); Schier et al. Gene 169:147- 155 (1995); Yelton et al. J. Immunol. 155: 1994-2004 (1995); Jackson et al., J. Immunol. 154(7):3310-9 (1995); Hawkins et al, J. MoI. BioL 226:889-896 (1992) and selective mutation at selective mutagenesis positions, contact or hypermutation positions with an activity enhancing amino acid residue as described in US patent US 6914128B1.\n\n\nThe term \"chimeric antibody\" refers to antibodies which comprise heavy and light chain variable region sequences from one species and constant region sequences from another species, such as antibodies having murine heavy and light chain variable regions linked to human constant regions.\n\n\nThe term \"CDR-grafted antibody\" refers to antibodies which comprise heavy and light chain variable region sequences from one species but in which the sequences of one or more of the CDR regions of VH and/or VL are replaced with CDR sequences of another species, such as antibodies having murine heavy and light chain variable regions in which one or more of the murine CDRs (e.g., CDR3) has been replaced with human CDR sequences.\n\n\nThe term \"humanized antibody\" refers to antibodies which comprise heavy and light chain variable region sequences from a non-human species (e.g., a mouse) but in which at least a portion of the VH and/or VL sequence has been altered to be more \"human-like\", i.e., more similar to human germline variable sequences. One type of humanized antibody is a CDR-grafted antibody, \n\n in which human CDR sequences are introduced into non-human VH and VL sequences to replace the corresponding nonhuman CDR sequences. Also \"humanized antibody\"is an antibody or a variant, derivative, analog or fragment thereof which immunospecifically binds to an antigen of interest and which comprises a framework (FR) region having substantially the amino acid sequence of a human antibody and a complementary determining region (CDR) having substantially the amino acid sequence of a non-human antibody. As used herein, the term \"substantially\" in the context of a CDR refers to a CDR having an amino acid sequence at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98% or at least 99% identical to the amino acid sequence of a non-human antibody CDR. A humanized antibody comprises substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains (Fab, Fab', F(ab') 2, FabC, Fv) in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin (i.e., donor antibody) and all or substantially all of the framework regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. In an embodiment, a humanized antibody also comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody contains both the light chain as well as at least the variable domain of a heavy chain. The antibody also may include the CHl, hinge, CH2, CH3, and CH4 regions of the heavy chain. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody only contains a humanized light chain. In some embodiments, a humanized antibody only contains a humanized heavy chain. In specific embodiments, a humanized antibody only contains a humanized variable domain of a light chain and/or humanized heavy chain.\n\n\nThe terms \"Kabat numbering\", \"Kabat definitions\" and \"Kabat labeling\" are used interchangeably herein. These terms, which are recognized in the art, refer to a system of numbering amino acid residues which are more variable (i.e. hypervariable) than other amino acid residues in the heavy and light chain variable regions of an antibody, or an antigen binding portion thereof (Kabat et al. (1971) Ann. NY Acad, ScL 190:382-391 and, Kabat, E.A., et al.\n\n\n(1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242). For the heavy chain variable region, the hypervariable region ranges from amino acid positions 31 to 35 for CDRl , amino acid positions 50 to 65 for CDR2, and amino acid positions 95 to 102 for CDR3. For the light chain variable region, the hypervariable region ranges from amino acid positions 24 to 34 for CDRl, amino acid positions 50 to 56 for CDR2, and amino acid positions 89 to 97 for CDR3.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"CDR\" refers to the complementarity determining region within antibody variable sequences. There are three CDRs in each of the variable regions of the heavy chain and the light chain, which are designated CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3, for each of the variable regions. The term \"CDR set\" as used herein refers to a group of three CDRs that occur in a single \n\n variable region capable of binding the antigen. The exact boundaries of these CDRs have been defined differently according to different systems. The system described by Kabat (Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1987) and (1991)) not only provides an unambiguous residue numbering system applicable to any variable region of an antibody, but also provides precise residue boundaries defining the three CDRs. These CDRs may be referred to as Kabat CDRs. Chothia and coworkers (Chothia &Lesk, J. MoI. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987) and Chothia et al., Nature 342:877-883 (1989)) found that certain sub- portions within Kabat CDRs adopt nearly identical peptide backbone conformations, despite having great diversity at the level of amino acid sequence. These sub-portions were designated as Ll, L2 and L3 or Hl, H2 and H3 where the \"L\" and the \"H\" designates the light chain and the heavy chains regions, respectively. These regions may be referred to as Chothia CDRs, which have boundaries that overlap with Kabat CDRs. Other boundaries defining CDRs overlapping with the Kabat CDRs have been described by Padlan (FASEB J. 9:133-139 (1995)) and MacCallum (J MoI Biol 262(5):732-45 (1996)). Still other CDR boundary definitions may not strictly follow one of the herein systems, but will nonetheless overlap with the Kabat CDRs, although they may be shortened or lengthened in light of prediction or experimental findings that particular residues or groups of residues or even entire CDRs do not significantly impact antigen binding. The methods used herein may utilize CDRs defined according to any of these systems, although certain embodiments use Kabat or Chothia defined CDRs.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"framework\" or \"framework sequence\" refers to the remaining sequences of a variable region minus the CDRs. Because the exact definition of a CDR sequence can be determined by different systems, the meaning of a framework sequence is subject to correspondingly different interpretations. The six CDRs (CDR-Ll, -L2, and -L3 of light chain and CDR-Hl, -H2, and -H3 of heavy chain) also divide the framework regions on the light chain and the heavy chain into four sub-regions (FRl, FR2, FR3 and FR4) on each chain, in which CDRl is positioned between FRl and FR2, CDR2 between FR2 and FR3, and CDR3 between FR3 and FR4. Without specifying the particular sub-regions as FRl, FR2, FR3 or FR4, a framework region, as referred by others, represents the combined FRs within the variable region of a single, naturally occurring immunoglobulin chain. As used herein, a FR represents one of the four sub- regions, and FRs represents two or more of the four sub- regions constituting a framework region.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"germline antibody gene\" or \"gene fragment\" refers to an immunoglobulin sequence encoded by non- lymphoid cells that have not undergone the maturation process that leads to genetic rearrangement and mutation for expression of a particular immunoglobulin. (See, e.g., Shapiro et al., Crit. Rev. Immunol. 22(3): 183-200 (2002); Marchalonis et al., Adv Exp Med Biol. 484:13-30 (2001)). One of the advantages provided by \n\n various embodiments of the present invention stems from the recognition that germline antibody genes are more likely than mature antibody genes to conserve essential amino acid sequence structures characteristic of individuals in the species, hence less likely to be recognized as from a foreign source when used therapeutically in that species.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"neutralizing\" refers to counteracting the biological activity of an antigen when a binding protein specifically binds the antigen. In an embodiment, the neutralizing binding protein binds the cytokine and reduces its biologically activity by at least about 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 85% or more.\n\n\nThe term \"activity\" includes activities such as the binding specificity and affinity of a DVD-Ig for two or more antigens.\n\n\nThe term \"epitope\" includes any polypeptide determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. In certain embodiments, epitope determinants include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl, or sulfonyl, and, in certain embodiments, may have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics. An epitope is a region of an antigen that is bound by an antibody. In certain embodiments, an antibody is said to specifically bind an antigen when it recognizes its target antigen in a complex mixture of proteins and/or macromolecules. Antibodies are said to \"bind to the same epitope\" if the antibodies cross-compete (one prevents the binding or modulating effect of the other). In addition structural definitions of epitopes (overlapping, similar, identical) are informative, but functional definitions are often more relevant as they encompass structural (binding) and functional (modulation, competition) parameters.\n\n\nThe term \"surface plasmon resonance\", as used herein, refers to an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BIAcore® system\n\n\n(BIAcore International AB, a GE Healthcare company, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, NJ). For further descriptions, see Jδnsson, U., et al. (1993) Ann. Biol. Clin. 5J_:19-26; Jδnsson, U., et al. (1991) Biotechniques 11 :620-627; Johnsson, B., et al. (1995) /. MoI. Recognit. 8:125-131; and Johnnson, B., et al. (1991) Anal. Biochem. 198:268-277.\n\n\nThe term \"K\n0n\n\", as used herein, is intended to refer to the on rate constant for association of a binding protein (e.g., an antibody) to the antigen to form the, e.g., antibody/antigen complex as is known in the art. The \"Kon\" also is known by the terms \"association rate constant\", or \"ka\", as used interchangeably herein. This value indicating the binding rate of an antibody to its target \n\n antigen or the rate of complex formation between an antibody and antigen also is shown by the equation below:\n\n\nAntibody (\"Ab\") + Antigen (\"Ag\")→Ab-Ag.\n\n\nThe term \"K^ff\", as used herein, is intended to refer to the off rate constant for dissociation, or \"dissociation rate constant\", of a binding protein (e.g., an antibody) from the, e.g., antibody/antigen complex as is known in the art. This value indicates the dissociation rate of an antibody from its target antigen or separation of Ab-Ag complex over time into free antibody and antigen as shown by the equation below:\n\n\nAb + Ag<-Ab-Ag.\n\n\nThe term \"K\nD\n\" , as used herein, is intended to refer to the \"equilibrium dissociation constant\", and refers to the value obtained in a titration measurement at equilibrium, or by dividing the dissociation rate constant (koff) by the association rate constant (kon). The association rate constant, the dissociation rate constant and the equilibrium dissociation constant are used to represent the binding affinity of an antibody to an antigen. Methods for determining association and dissociation rate constants are well known in the art. Using fluorescence-based techniques offers high sensitivity and the ability to examine samples in physiological buffers at equilibrium. Other experimental approaches and instruments such as a BIAcore® (biomolecular interaction analysis) assay can be used (e.g., instrument available from BIAcore International AB, a GE Healthcare company, Uppsala, Sweden). Additionally, a KinExA® (Kinetic Exclusion Assay) assay, available from Sapidyne Instruments (Boise, Idaho) can also be used.\n\n\n\"Label\" and \"detectable label\" mean a moiety attached to a specific binding partner, such as an antibody or an analyte, e.g., to render the reaction between members of a specific binding pair, such as an antibody and an analyte, detectable, and the specific binding partner, e.g., antibody or analyte, so labeled is referred to as \"detectably labeled.\" Thus, the term \"labeled binding protein\" as used herein, refers to a protein with a label incorporated that provides for the identification of the binding protein. In an embodiment, the label is a detectable marker that can produce a signal that is detectable by visual or instrumental means, e.g., incorporation of a radiolabeled amino acid or attachment to a polypeptide of biotinyl moieties that can be detected by marked avidin (e.g., streptavidin containing a fluorescent marker or enzymatic activity that can be detected by optical or colorimetric methods). Examples of labels for polypeptides include, but are not limited to, the following: radioisotopes or radionuclides (e.g., \n3\nH\n1\n \n14\nC\n1\n \n35\nS, \n90\nY, \n99\nTc, \n111\nIn, \n125\n1, \n131\n1, \n177\nLu, \n166\nHo, or \n153\nSm); chromogens, fluorescent labels (e.g., FITC, rhodamine, lanthanide phosphors), enzymatic labels (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, luciferase, alkaline \n\n phosphatase); chemiluminescent markers; biotinyl groups; predetermined polypeptide epitopes recognized by a secondary reporter (e.g., leucine zipper pair sequences, binding sites for secondary antibodies, metal binding domains, epitope tags); and magnetic agents, such as gadolinium chelates. Representative examples of labels commonly employed for immunassays include moieties that produce light, e.g., acridinium compounds, and moieties that produce fluorescence, e.g., fluorescein. Other labels are described herein. In this regard, the moiety itself may not be detectably labeled but may become detectable upon reaction with yet another moiety. Use of \"detectably labeled\" is intended to encompass the latter type of detectable labeling.\n\n\nThe term \"conjugate\" refers to a binding protein, such as an antibody, chemically linked to a second chemical moiety, such as a therapeutic or cytotoxic agent. The term \"agent\" is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a mixture of chemical compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from biological materials. In an embodiment, the therapeutic or cytotoxic agents include, but are not limited to, pertussis toxin, taxol, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, mitomycin, etoposide, tenoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, colchicin, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, mithramycin, actinomycin D, 1 -dehydrotestosterone, glucocorticoids, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. When employed in the context of an immunoassay, the conjugate antibody may be a detectably labeled antibody used as the detection antibody.\n\n\nThe terms \"crystal\" and \"crystallized\" as used herein, refer to a binding protein (e.g., an antibody), or antigen binding portion thereof, that exists in the form of a crystal. Crystals are one form of the solid state of matter, which is distinct from other forms such as the amorphous solid state or the liquid crystalline state. Crystals are composed of regular, repeating, three- dimensional arrays of atoms, ions, molecules (e.g., proteins such as antibodies), or molecular assemblies (e.g., antigen/antibody complexes). These three-dimensional arrays are arranged according to specific mathematical relationships that are well-understood in the field. The fundamental unit, or building block, that is repeated in a crystal is called the asymmetric unit. Repetition of the asymmetric unit in an arrangement that conforms to a given, well-defined crystallographic symmetry provides the \"unit cell\" of the crystal. Repetition of the unit cell by regular translations in all three dimensions provides the crystal. See Giege, R. and Ducruix, A. Barrett, Crystallization of Nucleic Acids and Proteins, a Practical Approach, 2nd ea., pp. 20 1- 16, Oxford University Press, New York, New York, (1999).\"\n\n\nThe term \"polynucleotide\" means a polymeric form of two or more nucleotides, either ribonucleotides or deoxvnucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide. The term includes single and double stranded forms of DNA. \n\n The term \"isolated polynucleotide\" shall mean a polynucleotide (e.g., of genomic, cDNA, or synthetic origin, or some combination thereof) that, by virtue of its origin , the \"isolated polynucleotide\" is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide with which the \"isolated polynucleotide\" is found in nature; is operably linked to a polynucleotide that it is not linked to in nature; or does not occur in nature as part of a larger sequence.\n\n\nThe term \"vector\", is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a \"plasmid\", which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced (e.g., bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors). Other vectors (e.g., non-episomal mammalian vectors) can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell, and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover, certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as \"recombinant expression vectors\" (or simply, \"expression vectors\"). In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification, \"plasmid\" and \"vector\" may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. However, the invention is intended to include such other forms of expression vectors, such as viral vectors (e.g., replication defective retroviruses, adenoviruses and adeno- associated viruses), which serve equivalent functions.\n\n\nThe term \"operably linked\" refers to a juxtaposition wherein the components described are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. A control sequence \"operably linked\" to a coding sequence is ligated in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control sequences. \"Operably linked\" sequences include both expression control sequences that are contiguous with the gene of interest and expression control sequences that act in trans or at a distance to control the gene of interest. The term \"expression control sequence\" as used herein refers to polynucleotide sequences which are necessary to effect the expression and processing of coding sequences to which they are ligated. Expression control sequences include appropriate transcription initiation, termination, promoter and enhancer sequences; efficient RNA processing signals such as splicing and polyadenylation signals; sequences that stabilize cytoplasmic mRNA; sequences that enhance translation efficiency (i.e., Kozak consensus sequence); sequences that enhance protein stability; and when desired, sequences that enhance protein secretion. The nature of such control sequences differs depending upon the host organism; in prokaryotes, such control sequences generally \n\n include promoter, ribosomal binding site, and transcription termination sequence; in eukaryotes, generally, such control sequences include promoters and transcription termination sequence. The term \"control sequences\" is intended to include components whose presence is essential for expression and processing, and can also include additional components whose presence is advantageous, for example, leader sequences and fusion partner sequences.\n\n\n\"Transformation\", refers to any process by which exogenous DNA enters a host cell. Transformation may occur under natural or artificial conditions using various methods well known in the art. Transformation may rely on any known method for the insertion of foreign nucleic acid sequences into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell. The method is selected based on the host cell being transformed and may include, but is not limited to, viral infection, electroporation, lipofection, and particle bombardment. Such \"transformed\" cells include stably transformed cells in which the inserted DNA is capable of replication either as an autonomously replicating plasmid or as part of the host chromosome. They also include cells which transiently express the inserted DNA or RNA for limited periods of time.\n\n\nThe term \"recombinant host cell\" (or simply \"host cell\"), is intended to refer to a cell into which exogenous DNA has been introduced. In an embodiment, the host cell comprises two more more (e.g., multiple) nucleic acids encoding antibodies, such as the host cells described in US Patent No. 7,262,028, for example. It should be understood that such terms are intended to refer not only to the particular subject cell, but to the progeny of such a cell. Because certain modifications may occur in succeeding generations due to either mutation or environmental influences, such progeny may not, in fact, be identical to the parent cell, but are still included within the scope of the term \"host cell\" as used herein. In an embodiment, host cells include prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells selected from any of the Kingdoms of life. In another embodiment, eukaryotic cells include protist, fungal, plant and animal cells. In another embodiment, host cells include but are not limited to the prokaryotic cell line E.Coli; mammalian cell lines CHO, HEK 293, COS, NSO, SP2 and PER.C6; the insect cell line Sf9; and the fungal cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n\n\nStandard techniques may be used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, and tissue culture and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques may be performed according to manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The foregoing techniques and procedures may be generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification. See e.g., Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory \n\n Manual (2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)), which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose.\n\n\n\"Transgenic organism\", as known in the art, refers to an organism having cells that contain a transgene, wherein the transgene introduced into the organism (or an ancestor of the organism) expresses a polypeptide not naturally expressed in the organism. A \"transgene\" is a DNA construct, which is stably and operably integrated into the genome of a cell from which a transgenic organism develops, directing the expression of an encoded gene product in one or more cell types or tissues of the transgenic organism.\n\n\nThe term \"regulate\"and \"modulate\" are used interchangeably, and, as used herein, refers to a change or an alteration in the activity of a molecule of interest (e.g., the biological activity of a cytokine). Modulation may be an increase or a decrease in the magnitude of a certain activity or function of the molecule of interest. Exemplary activities and functions of a molecule include, but are not limited to, binding characteristics, enzymatic activity, cell receptor activation, and signal transduction.\n\n\nCorrespondingly, the term \"modulator\" is a compound capable of changing or altering an activity or function of a molecule of interest (e.g., the biological activity of a cytokine). For example, a modulator may cause an increase or decrease in the magnitude of a certain activity or function of a molecule compared to the magnitude of the activity or function observed in the absence of the modulator. In certain embodiments, a modulator is an inhibitor, which decreases the magnitude of at least one activity or function of a molecule. Exemplary inhibitors include, but are not limited to, proteins, peptides, antibodies, peptibodies, carbohydrates or small organic molecules. Peptibodies are described, e.g., in WO01/83525.\n\n\nThe term \"agonist\", refers to a modulator that, when contacted with a molecule of interest, causes an increase in the magnitude of a certain activity or function of the molecule compared to the magnitude of the activity or function observed in the absence of the agonist. Particular agonists of interest may include, but are not limited to, polypeptides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, or any other molecules that bind to the antigen.\n\n\nThe term \"antagonist\" or \"inhibitor\", refer to a modulator that, when contacted with a molecule of interest causes a decrease in the magnitude of a certain activity or function of the molecule compared to the magnitude of the activity or function observed in the absence of the antagonist. Particular antagonists of interest include those that block or modulate the biological or immunological activity of of the antigen. Antagonists and inhibitors of antigens may include, but \n\n are not limited to, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, or any other molecules, which bind to the antigen.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"effective amount\" refers to the amount of a therapy which is sufficient to reduce or ameliorate the severity and/or duration of a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof, prevent the advancement of a disorder, cause regression of a disorder, prevent the recurrence, development, onset or progression of one or more symptoms associated with a disorder, detect a disorder, or enhance or improve the prophylactic or therapeutic effect(s) of another therapy (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agent).\n\n\n\"Patient\" and \"subject\" may be used interchangeably herein to refer to an animal, such as a mammal, including a primate (for example, a human, a monkey, and a chimpanzee), a non- primate (for example, a cow, a pig, a camel, a llama, a horse, a goat, a rabbit, a sheep, a hamster, a guinea pig, a cat, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a whale), a bird (e.g., a duck or a goose), and a shark. Preferably, the patient or subject is a human, such as a human being treated or assessed for a disease, disorder or condition, a human at risk for a disease, disorder or condition, a human having a disease, disorder or condition, and/or human being treated for a disease, disorder or condition.\n\n\nThe term \"sample\", as used herein, is used in its broadest sense. A \"biological sample\", as used herein, includes, but is not limited to, any quantity of a substance from a living thing or formerly living thing. Such living things include, but are not limited to, humans, mice, rats, monkeys, dogs, rabbits and other animals. Such substances include, but are not limited to, blood, (e.g., whole blood), plasma, serum, urine, amniotic fluid, synovial fluid, endothelial cells, leukocytes, monocytes, other cells, organs, tissues, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen.\n\n\n\"Component,\" \"components,\" and \"at least one component,\" refer generally to a capture antibody, a detection or conjugate antibody, a control, a calibrator, a series of calibrators, a sensitivity panel, a container, a buffer, a diluent, a salt, an enzyme, a co-factor for an enzyme, a detection reagent, a pretreatment reagent/solution, a substrate (e.g., as a solution), a stop solution, and the like that can be included in a kit for assay of a test sample, such as a patient urine, serum or plasma sample, in accordance with the methods described herein and other methods known in the art. Thus, in the context of the present disclosure, \"at least one component,\" \"component,\" and \"components\" can include a polypeptide or other analyte as above, such as a composition comprising an analyte such as polypeptide, which is optionally immobilized on a solid support, such as by binding to an anti-analyte (e.g., anti-polypeptide) antibody. Some components can be in solution or lyophilized for reconstitution for use in an assay. \n\n \"Control\" refers to a composition known to not analyte (\"negative control\") or to contain analyte (\"positive control\"). A positive control can comprise a known concentration of analyte. \"Control,\" \"positive control,\" and \"calibrator\" may be used interchangeably herein to refer to a composition comprising a known concentration of analyte. A \"positive control\" can be used to establish assay performance characteristics and is a useful indicator of the integrity of reagents (e.g., analytes).\n\n\n\"Predetermined cutoff and \"predetermined level\" refer generally to an assay cutoff value that is used to assess diagnostic/prognostic/therapeutic efficacy results by comparing the assay results against the predetermined cutoff/level, where the predetermined cutoff/level already has been linked or associated with various clinical parameters (e.g., severity of disease, progression/nonprogression/improvement, etc.). While the present disclosure may provide exemplary predetermined levels, it is well-known that cutoff values may vary depending on the nature of the immunoassay (e.g., antibodies employed, etc.). It further is well within the ordinary skill of one in the art to adapt the disclosure herein for other immunoassays to obtain immunoassay-specific cutoff values for those other immunoassays based on this disclosure. Whereas the precise value of the predetermined cutoff/level may vary between assays, correlations as described herein (if any) should be generally applicable.\n\n\n\"Pretreatment reagent,\" e.g., lysis, precipitation and/or solubilization reagent, as used in a diagnostic assay as described herein is one that lyses any cells and/or solubilizes any analyte that is/are present in a test sample. Pretreatment is not necessary for all samples, as described further herein. Among other things, solubilizing the analyte (e.g., polypeptide of interest) may entail release of the analyte from any endogenous binding proteins present in the sample. A pretreatment reagent may be homogeneous (not requiring a separation step) or heterogeneous (requiring a separation step). With use of a heterogeneous pretreatment reagent there is removal of any precipitated analyte binding proteins from the test sample prior to proceeding to the next step of the assay.\n\n\n\"Quality control reagents\" in the context of immunoassays and kits described herein, include, but are not limited to, calibrators, controls, and sensitivity panels. A \"calibrator\" or \"standard\" typically is used (e.g., one or more, such as a plurality) in order to establish calibration (standard) curves for interpolation of the concentration of an analyte, such as an antibody or an analyte. Alternatively, a single calibrator, which is near a predetermined positive/negative cutoff, can be used. Multiple calibrators (i.e., more than one calibrator or a varying amount of calibrator(s)) can be used in conjunction so as to comprise a \"sensitivity panel.\" \n\n \"Risk\" refers to the possibility or probability of a particular event occurring either presently or at some point in the future. \"Risk stratification\" refers to an array of known clinical risk factors that allows physicians to classify patients into a low, moderate, high or highest risk of developing a particular disease, disorder or condition.\n\n\n\"Specific\" and \"specificity\" in the context of an interaction between members of a specific binding pair (e.g., an antigen (or fragment thereof) and an antibody (or antigenically reactive fragment thereof)) refer to the selective reactivity of the interaction. The phrase \"specifically binds to\" and analogous phrases refer to the ability of antibodies (or antigenically reactive fragments thereof) to bind specifically to analyte (or a fragment thereof) and not bind specifically to other entities.\n\n\n\"Specific binding partner\" is a member of a specific binding pair. A specific binding pair comprises two different molecules, which specifically bind to each other through chemical or physical means. Therefore, in addition to antigen and antibody specific binding pairs of common immunoassays, other specific binding pairs can include biotin and avidin (or streptavidin), carbohydrates and lectins, complementary nucleotide sequences, effector and receptor molecules, cofactors and enzymes, enzyme inhibitors and enzymes, and the like. Furthermore, specific binding pairs can include members that are analogs of the original specific binding members, for example, an analyte-analog. Immunoreactive specific binding members include antigens, antigen fragments, and antibodies, including monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies as well as complexes, fragments, and variants (including fragments of variants) thereof, whether isolated or recombinantly produced.\n\n\n\"Variant\" as used herein means a polypeptide that differs from a given polypeptide (e.g., IL- 18, BNP, NGAL or HIV polypeptide or anti-polypeptide antibody) in amino acid sequence by the addition (e.g., insertion), deletion, or conservative substitution of amino acids, but that retains the biological activity of the given polypeptide (e.g., a variant IL-18 can compete with anti-IL-18 antibody for binding to IL-18). A conservative substitution of an amino acid, i.e., replacing an amino acid with a different amino acid of similar properties (e.g., hydrophilicity and degree and distribution of charged regions) is recognized in the art as typically involving a minor change. These minor changes can be identified, in part, by considering the hydropathic index of amino acids, as understood in the art (see, e.g., Kyte et al., J. MoI. Biol. 157: 105-132 (1982)). The hydropathic index of an amino acid is based on a consideration of its hydrophobicity and charge. It is known in the art that amino acids of similar hydropathic indexes can be substituted and still retain protein function. In one aspect, amino acids having hydropathic indexes of ± 2 are substituted. The hydrophilicity of amino acids also can be used to reveal substitutions that would result in proteins retaining biological function. A consideration of the hydrophilicity of amino \n\n acids in the context of a peptide permits calculation of the greatest local average hydrophilicity of that peptide, a useful measure that has been reported to correlate well with antigenicity and immunogenicity (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,101, which is incorporated herein by reference). Substitution of amino acids having similar hydrophilicity values can result in peptides retaining biological activity, for example immunogenicity, as is understood in the art. In one aspect, substitutions are performed with amino acids having hydrophilicity values within ± 2 of each other. Both the hydrophobicity index and the hydrophilicity value of amino acids are influenced by the particular side chain of that amino acid. Consistent with that observation, amino acid substitutions that are compatible with biological function are understood to depend on the relative similarity of the amino acids, and particularly the side chains of those amino acids, as revealed by the hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, charge, size, and other properties. \"Variant\" also can be used to describe a polypeptide or fragment thereof that has been differentially processed, such as by proteolysis, phosphorylation, or other post-translational modification, yet retains its biological activity or antigen reactivity, e.g., the ability to bind to IL-18. Use of \"variant\" herein is intended to encompass fragments of a variant unless otherwise contradicted by context.\n\n\nI. Generation of DVD binding protein\n\n\nThe invention pertains to Dual Variable Domain binding proteins capable of binding one or more targets and methods of making the same. In an embodiment, the binding protein comprises a polypeptide chain, wherein said polypeptide chain comprises VDl-(Xl)n-VD2-C- (X2)n, wherein VDl is a first variable domain, VD2 is a second variable domain, C is a constant domain, Xl represents an amino acid or polypeptide, X2 represents an Fc region and n is 0 or 1. The binding protein of the invention can be generated using various techniques. The invention provides expression vectors, host cell and methods of generating the binding protein.\n\n\nA. Generation of parent monoclonal antibodies\n\n\nThe variable domains of the DVD binding protein can be obtained from parent antibodies, including polyclonal and mAbs capable of binding antigens of interest. These antibodies may be naturally occurring or may be generated by recombinant technology.\n\n\nMAbs can be prepared using a wide variety of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma, recombinant, and phage display technologies, or a combination thereof. For example, mAbs can be produced using hybridoma techniques including those known in the art and taught, for example, in Harlow et al. , Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2nd ed. 1988); Hammerling, et al., in: Monoclonal Antibodies and T-CeIl Hybridomas 563-681 (Elsevier, N.Y., 1981) (said references incorporated by reference in their \n\n entireties). The term \"monoclonal antibody\" as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term \"monoclonal antibody\" refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone, including any eukaryotic, prokaryotic, or phage clone, and not the method by which it is produced. Hybridomas are selected, cloned and further screened for desirable characteristics, including robust hybridoma growth, high antibody production and desirable antibody characteristics, as discussed in Example lbelow. Hybridomas may be cultured and expanded in vivo in syngeneic animals, in animals that lack an immune system, e.g., nude mice, or in cell culture in vitro. Methods of selecting, cloning and expanding hybridomas are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In a particular embodiment, the hybridomas are mouse hybridomas. In another embodiment, the hybridomas are produced in a non-human, non-mouse species such as rats, sheep, pigs, goats, cattle or horses. In another embodiment, the hybridomas are human hybridomas, in which a human non-secretory myeloma is fused with a human cell expressing an antibody capable of binding a specific antigen.\n\n\nRecombinant inAbs are also generated from single, isolated lymphocytes using a procedure referred to in the art as the selected lymphocyte antibody method (SLAM), as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,627,052, PCT Publication WO 92/02551 and Babcock, J.S. et al. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:7843-7848. In this method, single cells secreting antibodies of interest, e.g., lymphocytes derived from an immunized animal, are identified, and, heavy- and light-chain variable region cDNAs are rescued from the cells by reverse transcriptase-PCR and these variable regions can then be expressed, in the context of appropriate immunoglobulin constant regions (e.g., human constant regions), in mammalian host cells, such as COS or CHO cells. The host cells transfected with the amplified immunoglobulin sequences, derived from in vivo selected lymphocytes, can then undergo further analysis and selection in vitro, for example by panning the transfected cells to isolate cells expressing antibodies to the antigen of interest. The amplified immunoglobulin sequences further can be manipulated in vitro, such as by in vitro affinity maturation methods such as those described in PCT Publication WO 97/29131 and PCT Publication WO 00/56772.\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies are also produced by immunizing a non-human animal comprising some, or all, of the human immunoglobulin locus with an antigen of interest. In an embodiment, the non-human animal is a XENOMOUSE transgenic mouse, an engineered mouse strain that comprises large fragments of the human immunoglobulin loci and is deficient in mouse antibody production. See, e.g., Green et al. Nature Genetics 7:13-21 (1994) and United States Patents Nos. 5,916,771, 5,939,598, 5,985,615, 5,998,209, 6,075,181, 6,091,001, 6,114,598 and 6,130,364. See also WO 91/10741, published July 25,1991, WO 94/02602, published February 3, 1994, WO 96/34096 and WO 96/33735, both published October 31 , \n\n 1996, WO 98/16654, published April 23, 1998, WO 98/24893, published June 11, 1998, WO 98/50433, published November 12, 1998, WO 99/45031, published September 10, 1999, WO 99/53049, published October 21, 1999, WO 00 09560, published February 24, 2000 and WO 00/037504, published June 29, 2000. The XENOMOUSE transgenic mouse produces an adult- like human repertoire of fully human antibodies, and generates antigen-specific human monoclonal antibodies. The XENOMOUSE transgenic mouse contains approximately 80% of the human antibody repertoire through introduction of megabase sized, germline configuration YAC fragments of the human heavy chain loci and x light chain loci. See Mendez et al., Nature Genetics 15:146-156 (1997), Green and Jakobovits J. Exp. Med. 188:483-495 (1998), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\nIn vitro methods also can be used to make the parent antibodies, wherein an antibody library is screened to identify an antibody having the desired binding specificity. Methods for such screening of recombinant antibody libraries are well known in the art and include methods described in, for example, Ladner et al. U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409; Kang et al. PCT Publication No. WO 92/18619; Dower et al. PCT Publication No. WO 91/17271 ; Winter et al. PCT\n\n\nPublication No. WO 92/20791; Markland et al. PCT Publication No. WO 92/15679; Breitling et al.

In phage display methods, functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In a particular, such phage can be utilized to display antigen-binding domains expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library (e. g., human or murine). Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds the antigen of interest can be selected or identified with antigen, e.g., using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and Ml 3 binding domains expressed from phage with Fab, Fv or disulfide stabilized Fv antibody domains recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII protein. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to \n\n make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman et al., J. Immunol. Methods 182:41-50 (1995); Ames et al., J. Immunol. Methods 184:177-186 (1995); Kettleborough et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 24:952-958 (1994); Persic et al., Gene 187 9-18 (1997); Burton et al., Advances in Immunology 57:191-280 (1994); PCT application No. PCT/GB91/01134; PCT publications WO 90/02809; WO 91/10737; WO 92/01047; WO\n\n\n92/18619; WO 93/11236; WO 95/15982; WO 95/20401 ; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,698,426; 5,223,409; 5,403,484; 5,580,717; 5,427,908; 5,750,753; 5,821,047; 5,571,698; 5,427,908; 5,516,637; 5,780, 225; 5,658,727; 5,733,743 and 5,969,108; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nAs described in the herein references, after phage selection, the antibody coding regions from the phage can be isolated and used to generate whole antibodies including human antibodies or any other desired antigen binding fragment, and expressed in any desired host, including mammalian cells, insect cells, plant cells, yeast, and bacteria, e.g., as described in detail below. For example, techniques to recombinantly produce Fab, Fab' and F(ab')2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in PCT publication WO\n\n\n92/22324; Mullinax et al., BioTechniques 12(6):864-869 (1992); and Sawai et al., AJRI 34:26-34 (1995); and Better et al., Science 240:1041-1043 (1988) (said references incorporated by reference in their entireties). Examples of techniques which can be used to produce single-chain Fvs and antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. 4,946,778 and 5,258, 498; Huston et al., Methods in Enzymology 203:46-88 (1991); Shu et al., PNAS 90:7995-7999 (1993); and Skerra et al., Science 240:1038-1040 (1988).\n\n\nAlternative to screening of recombinant antibody libraries by phage display, other methodologies known in the art for screening large combinatorial libraries can be applied to the identification of parent antibodies. One type of alternative expression system is one in which the recombinant antibody library is expressed as RNA-protein fusions, as described in PCT\n\n\nPublication No. WO 98/31700 by Szostak and Roberts, and in Roberts, R. W. and Szostak, J.W. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 94:12297-12302. In this system, a covalent fusion is created between an mRNA and the peptide or protein that it encodes by in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs that carry puromycin, a peptidyl acceptor antibiotic, at their 3 ' end. Thus, a specific mRNA can be enriched from a complex mixture of mRNAs (e.g., a combinatorial library) based on the properties of the encoded peptide or protein, e.g., antibody, or portion thereof, such as binding of the antibody, or portion thereof, to the dual specificity antigen. Nucleic acid sequences encoding antibodies, or portions thereof, recovered from screening of such libraries can be expressed by recombinant means as described herein (e.g., in mammalian host cells) and, moreover, can be subjected to further affinity maturation by either additional rounds of screening \n\n of mRNA-peptide fusions in which mutations have been introduced into the originally selected sequence(s), or by other methods for affinity maturation in vitro of recombinant antibodies, as described herein.\n\n\nIn another approach the parent antibodies can also be generated using yeast display methods known in the art. In yeast display methods, genetic methods are used to tether antibody domains to the yeast cell wall and display them on the surface of yeast. In particular, such yeast can be utilized to display antigen-binding domains expressed from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library (e.g., human or murine). Examples of yeast display methods that can be used to make the parent antibodies include those disclosed in Wittrup, et al. U.S. Patent No. 6,699,658 incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe antibodies described herein can be further modified to generate CDR grafted and humanized parent antibodies. CDR-grafted parent antibodies comprise heavy and light chain variable region sequences from a human antibody wherein one or more of the CDR regions of V\nH\n and/or V\nL\n are replaced with CDR sequences of murine antibodies capable of binding antigen of interest. A framework sequence from any human antibody may serve as the template for CDR grafting. However, straight chain replacement onto such a framework often leads to some loss of binding affinity to the antigen. The more homologous a human antibody is to the original murine antibody, the less likely the possibility that combining the murine CDRs with the human framework will introduce distortions in the CDRs that could reduce affinity. Therefore, in an embodiment, the human variable framework that is chosen to replace the murine variable framework apart from the CDRs have at least a 65% sequence identity with the murine antibody variable region framework. In an embodiment, the human and murine variable regions apart from the CDRs have at least 70% sequence identify. In a particular embodiment, that the human and murine variable regions apart from the CDRs have at least 75% sequence identity.

Health (1983), each entirely incorporated herein by reference. Such imported sequences can be used to reduce immunogenicity or reduce, enhance or modify binding, affinity, on-rate, off-rate, avidity, specificity, half-life, or any other suitable characteristic, as known in the art.\n\n\nFramework residues in the human framework regions may be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter, e.g., improve, antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art, e.g., by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. (See, e.g., Queen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,089; Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323 (1988), which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.) Three-dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three-dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate \n\n immunoglobulin sequence, i.e., the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way, FR residues can be selected and combined from the consensus and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic, such as increased affinity for the target antigen(s), is achieved. In general, the CDR residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding. Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art, such as but not limited to those described in Jones et al., Nature 321 :522 (1986); Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534 (1988)), Sims et al., J.

Criteria for selecting parent monoclonal antibodies\n\n\nAn embodiment of the invention pertains to selecting parent antibodies with at least one or more properties desired in the DVD-Ig molecule. In an embodiment, the desired property is selected from one or more antibody parameters. In another embodiment, the antibody parameters are selected from the group consisting of antigen specificity, affinity to antigen, potency, biological function, epitope recognition, stability, solubility, production efficiency, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, tissue cross reactivity, and orthologous antigen binding.\n\n\nBl. Affinity to Antigen\n\n\nThe desired affinity of a therapeutic mAb may depend upon the nature of the antigen, and the desired therapeutic end-point. In an embodiment, monoclonal antibodies have higher affinities (Kd = 0.01 - 0.50 pM) when blocking a cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction as such interaction are usually high affinity interactions (e.g.,<pM - <nM ranges). In such instances, the mAb affinity for its target should be equal to or better than the affinity of the cytokine (ligand) for its receptor. On the other hand, mAb with lesser affinity (> nM range) could be therapeutically effective e.g.,in clearing circulating potentially pathogenic proteins e.g., mono clonal antibodies that bind to, sequester, and clear circulating species of A-β amyloid. In other instances, reducing \n\n the affinity of an existing high affinity mAb by site-directed mutagenesis or using a mAb with lower affinity for its target could be used to avoid potential side-effects e.g.,a high affinity mAb may sequester/neutralize all of its intended target, thereby completely depleting/eliminating the function(s) of the targeted protein. In this scenario, a low affinity mAb may sequester/neutralize a fraction of the target that may be responsible for the disease symptoms (the pathological or overproduced levels), thus allowing a fraction of the target to continue to perform its normal physiological function(s). Therefore, it may be possible to reduce the Kd to adjust dose and/or reduce side-effects. The affinity of the parental mAb might play a role in appropriately targeting cell surface molecules to achieve desired therapeutic out-come. For example, if a target is expressed on cancer cells with high density and on normal cells with low density, a lower affinity mAb will bind a greater number of targets on tumor cells than normal cells, resulting in tumor cell elimination via ADCC or CDC, and therefore might have therapeutically desirable effects. Thus selecting a mAb with desired affinity may be relevant for both soluble and surface targets.\n\n\nSignaling through a receptor upon interaction with its ligand may depend upon the affinity of the receptor-ligand interaction. Similarly, it is conceivable that the affinity of a mAb for a surface receptor could determine the nature of intracellular signaling and whether the mAb may deliver an agonist or an antagonist signal. The affinity-based nature of mAb -mediated signaling may have an impact of its side-effect profile. Therefore, the desired affinity and desired functions of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies need to be determined carefully by in vitro and in vivo experimentation.\n\n\nThe desired Kd of a binding protein (e.g., an antibody) may be determined experimentally depending on the desired therapeutic outcome. In an embodiment parent antibodies with affinity (Kd) for a particular antigen equal to, or better than, the desired affinity of the DVD-Ig for the same antigen are selected. The antigen binding affinity and kinetics are assessed by Biacore or another similar technique. In one embodiment, each parent antibody has a dissociation constant (Kd) to its antigen selected from the group consisting of: at most about 10\n\"7\n M; at most about 10\n\"8\n M; at most about 10\n\"9\n M; at most about 10\n\"10\n M; at most about 10\n\"π\n M; at most about 10\n\"12\n M; and at most 10\n~13\n M. First parent antibody from which VDl is obtained and second parent antibody from which VD2 is obtained may have similar or different affinity (K\nD\n) for the respective antigen. Each parent antibody has an on rate constant (Kon) to the antigen selected from the group consisting of: at least about 10\n2\nM\n4\nS\n\"1\n; at least about 10\n3\nM\n4\nS\n\"1\n; at least about 10\n4\nM\n-1\nS\n\"1\n; at least about 10\n5\nM\n-1\nS\n\"1\n; and at least about 10\n6\nM\n-1\nS\n\"1\n, as measured by surface plasmon resonance. The first parent antibody from which VDl is obtained and the second parent antibody from which VD2 is obtained may have similar or different on rate constant (Kon) for the respective antigen. In one embodiment, each parent antibody has an off rate constant (Koff) to the antigen selected from the \n\n group consisting of: at most about 10\n\"3\nS\n\"1\n; at most about 10\n\"4\nS\n\"1\n; at most about 10\n\"5\nS\n\"1\n; and at most about 10\n\"6\nS\n\"1\n, as measured by surface plasmon resonance. The first parent antibody from which VDl is obtained and the second parent antibody from which VD2 is obtained may have similar or different off rate constants (Ko ff) for the respective antigen.\n\n\nB2. Potency\n\n\nThe desired affinity/potency of parental monoclonal antibodies will depend on the desired therapeutic outcome. For example, for receptor-ligand (R-L) interactions the affinity (kd) is equal to or better than the R-L kd (pM range). For simple clearance of a pathologic circulating protein, the kd could be in low nM range e.g.,clearance of various species of circulating A-β peptide. In addition, the kd will also depend on whether the target expresses multiple copies of the same epitope e.g a mAb targeting conformational epitope in Aβ oligomers.\n\n\nWhere VDI and VD2 bind the same antigen, but distint epitopes, the DVD-Ig will contain 4 binding sites for the same antigen, thus increasing avidity and thereby the apparent kd of the DVD-Ig. In an embodiment, parent antibodies with equal or lower kd than that desired in the DVD-Ig are chosen. The affinity considerations of a parental mAb may also depend upon whether the DVD-Ig contains four or more identical antigen binding sites (i.e; a DVD-Ig from a single mAb). In this case, the apparent kd would be greater than the mAb due to avidity. Such DVD-Igs can be employed for cross-linking surface receptor, increase neutralization potency, enhance clearance of pathological proteins etc.\n\n\nIn an embodiment parent antibodies with neutralization potency for specific antigen equal to or better than the desired neutralization potential of the DVD-Ig for the same antigen are selected. The neutralization potency can be assessed by a target-dependent bioassay where cells of appropriate type produce a measurable signal (i.e. proliferation or cytokine production) in response to target stimulation, and target neutralization by the mAb can reduce the signal in a dose-dependent manner.\n\n\nB3. Biological functions\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies can perform potentially several functions. Some of these functions are listed in Table 1. These functions can be assessed by both in vitro assays (e.g., cell-based and biochemical assays) and in vivo animal models. \n\n Table 1. Some Potential Applications For Therapeutic Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAbs with distinct functions described in the examples herein in Table 1 can be selected to achieve desired therapeutic outcomes. Two or more selected parent monoclonal antibodies can then be used in DVD-Ig format to achieve two distinct functions in a single DVD-Ig molecule. For example, a DVD-Ig can be generated by selecting a parent mAb that neutralizes function of a specific cytokine, and selecting a parent mAb that enhances clearance of a pathological protein. Similarly, we can select two parent monoclonal antibodies that recognize two different cell surface receptors, one mAb with an agonist function on one receptor and the other mAb with an antagonist function on a different receptor. These two selected monoclonal antibodies each with a distinct function can be used to construct a single DVD-Ig molecule that will possess the two distinct functions (agonist and antagonist) of the selected monoclonal antibodies in a single molecule. Similarly, two antagonistic monoclonal antibodies to cell surface receptors each blocking binding of respective receptor ligands (e.g.,EGF and IGF) can be used in a DVD-Ig format. Conversely, an antagonistic anti-receptor mAb (e.g.,anti-EGFR) and a neutralizing anti- soluble mediator (e.g.,anti-IGFl/2) mAb can be selected to make a DVD-Ig.\n\n\nB4. Epitope Recognition:\n\n\nDifferent regions of proteins may perform different functions. For example specific regions of a cytokine interact with the cytokine receptor to bring about receptor activation whereas other regions of the protein may be required for stabilizing the cytokine. In this instance one may select a mAb that binds specifically to the receptor interacting region(s) on the cytokine and thereby block cytokine-receptor interaction. In some cases, for example certain chemokine receptors that bind multiple ligands, a mAb that binds to the epitope (region on chemokine receptor) that interacts with only one ligand can be selected. In other instances, monoclonal antibodies can bind to epitopes on a target that are not directly responsible for physiological functions of the protein, but binding of a mAb to these regions could either interfere with \n\n physiological functions (steric hindrance) or alter the conformation of the protein such that the protein cannot function (mAb to receptors with multiple ligand which alter the receptor conformation such that none of the ligand can bind). Anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies that do not block binding of the cytokine to its receptor, but block signal transduction have also been identified (e.g., 125-2H, an anti-IL-18 mAb).\n\n\nExamples of epitopes and mAb functions include, but are not limited to, blocking Receptor-Ligand (R-L) interaction (neutralizing mAb that binds R-interacting site); steric hindrance resulting in diminished or no R-binding. An Ab can bind the target at a site other than a receptor binding site, but still interferes with receptor binding and functions of the target by inducing conformational change and eliminate function (e.g., Xolair), binding to R but block signaling (125 -2H).\n\n\nIn an embodiment, the parental mAb needs to target the appropriate epitope for maximum efficacy. Such epitope should be conserved in the DVD-Ig. The binding epitope of a mAb can be determined by several approaches, including co-crystallography, limited proteolysis of mAb- antigen complex plus mass spectrometric peptide mapping (Legros V. et al 2000 Protein Sci. 9:1002-10), phage displayed peptide libraries (O'Connor KH et al 2005 J Immunol Methods. 299:21-35), as well as mutagenesis (Wu C. et al . 2003 J Immunol 170:5571-7).\n\n\nB5. Physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties:\n\n\nTherapeutic treatment with antibodies often requires administration of high doses, often several mg/kg (due to a low potency on a mass basis as a consequence of a typically large molecular weight). In order to accommodate patient compliance and to adequately address chronic disease therapies and outpatient treatment, subcutaneous (s.c.) or intramuscular (i.m.) administration of therapeutic mAbs is desirable. For example, the maximum desirable volume for s.c. administration is ~1.0 mL, and therefore, concentrations of >100 mg/mL are desirable to limit the number of injections per dose. In an embodiment, the therapeutic antibody is administered in one dose. The development of such formulations is constrained, however, by protein-protein interactions (e.g., aggregation, which potentially increases immunogenicity risks) and by limitations during processing and delivery (e.g., viscosity). Consequently, the large quantities required for clinical efficacy and the associated development constraints limit full exploitation of the potential of antibody formulation and s.c. administration in high-dose regimens. It is apparent that the physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties of a protein molecule and the protein solution are of utmost importance, e.g.,stability, solubility and viscosity features. \n\n B5.1. Stability:\n\n\nA \"stable\" antibody formulation is one in which the antibody therein essentially retains its physical stability and/or chemical stability and/or biological activity upon storage. Stability can be measured at a selected temperature for a selected time period. In an embodiment,, the antibody in the formulation is stable at room temperature (about 30\n0\nC) or at 40\n0\nC for at least 1 month and/or stable at about 2-8°C. for at least 1 year for at least 2 years. Furthermore, in an embodiment, the formulation is stable following freezing (to, e.g., -70\n0\nC) and thawing of the formulation, hereinafter referred to as a \"freeze/thaw cycle.\" In another example, a \"stable\" formulation may be one wherein less than about 10% and less than about 5% of the protein is present as an aggregate in the formulation.\n\n\nA DVD-Ig stable in vitro at various temperatures for an extended time period is desirable. One can achieve this by rapid screening of parental mAbs stable in vitro at elevated temperature, e.g.,at 40\n0\nC for 2-4 weeks, and then assess stability. During storage at 2-8°C, the protein reveals stability for at least 12 months, e.g., at least 24 months. Stability (% of monomelic, intact molecule) can be assessed using various techniques such as cation exchange chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, SDS-PAGE, as well as bioactivity testing. For a more comprehensive list of analytical techniques that may be employed to analyze covalent and conformational modifications see Jones, A. J. S. (1993) Analytical methods for the assessment of protein formulations and delivery systems. In: Cleland, J. L.; Langer, R., editors. Formulation and delivery of peptides and proteins, 1\nst\n edition, Washington, ACS, pg. 22-45; and Pearlman, R.; Nguyen, T. FL(1990) Analysis of protein drugs. In: Lee, V. H., editor. Peptide and protein drug delivery, 1st edition, New York, Marcel Dekker, Inc., pg. 247-301.\n\n\nHeterogeneity and aggregate formation: stability of the antibody may be such that the formulation may reveal less than about 10%, and, in an embodiment, less than about 5%, in another embodiment, less than about 2%, or, in an embodiment, within the range of 0.5% to 1.5% or less in the GMP antibody material that is present as aggregate. Size exclusion chromatography is a method that is sensitive, reproducible, and very robust in the detection of protein aggregates.\n\n\nIn addition to low aggregate levels, the antibody must , in an embodiment, be chemically stable. Chemical stability may be determined by ion exchange chromatography (e.g.,cation or anion exchange chromatography), hydrophobic interaction chromatography, or other methods such as isoelectric focusing or capillary electrophoresis. For instance, chemical stability of the antibody may be such that after storage of at least 12 months at 2-8°C the peak representing unmodified antibody in a cation exchange chromatography may increase not more than 20%, in \n\n an embodiment, not more than 10%, or, in another embodiment, not more than 5% as compared to the antibody solution prior to storage testing.\n\n\nIn an embodiment, the parent antibodies display structural integrity; correct disulfide bond formation, and correct folding: Chemical instability due to changes in secondary or tertiary structure of an antibody may impact antibody activity. For instance, stability as indicated by activity of the antibody may be such that after storage of at least 12 months at 2-8°C the activity of the antibody may decrease not more than 50%, in an embodiment not more than 30%, or even not more than 10%, or in an embodiment not more than 5% or 1% as compared to the antibody solution prior to storage testing. Suitable antigen-binding assays can be employed to determine antibody activity.\n\n\nB5.2. Solubility:\n\n\nThe \"solubility\" of a mAb correlates with the production of correctly folded, monomelic IgG. The solubility of the IgG may therefore be assessed by HPLC. For example, soluble (monomelic) IgG will give rise to a single peak on the HPLC chromatograph, whereas insoluble (e.g., multimeric and aggregated) will give rise to a plurality of peaks. A person skilled in the art will therefore be able to detect an increase or decrease in solubility of an IgG using routine HPLC techniques. For a more comprehensive list of analytical techniques that may be employed to analyze solubility (see Jones, A. G. Dep. Chem. Biochem. Eng., Univ. Coll. London, London, UK. Editor(s): Shamlou, P. Ayazi. Process. Solid-Liq. Suspensions (1993), 93-117. Publisher: Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, UK and Pearlman, Rodney; Nguyen, Tue H, Advances in\n\n\nParenteral Sciences (1990), 4 (Pept. Protein Drug Delivery), 247-301). Solubility of a therapeutic mAb is critical for formulating to high concentration often required for adequate dosing. As outlined herein, solubilities of > 100 mg/mL may be required to accommodate efficient antibody dosing. For instance, antibody solubility may be not less than about 5 mg/mL in early research phase, in an embodiment not less than about 25 mg/mL in advanced process science stages, or in an embodiment not less than about 100 mg/mL, or in an embodiment not less than about 150 mg/mL. It is obvious to a person skilled in the art that the intrinsic properties of a protein molecule are important the physico-chemical properties of the protein solution, e.g.,stability, solubility, viscosity. However, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that a broad variety of excipients exist that may be used as additives to beneficially impact the characteristics of the final protein formulation. These excipients may include: (i) liquid solvents, cosolvents (e.g.,alcohols such as ethanol); (ii) buffering agents (e.g.,phosphate, acetate, citrate, amino acid buffers); (iii) sugars or sugar alcohols (e.g.,sucrose, trehalose, fructose, raffinose, mannitol, sorbitol, dextrans); (iv) surfactants (e.g.,polysorbate 20, 40, 60, 80, poloxamers); (v) isotonicity modifiers (e.g.,salts \n\n such as NaCl, sugars, sugar alcohols); and (vi) others (e.g.,preservatives, chelating agents, antioxidants, chelating substances (e.g.,EDTA), biodegradable polymers, carrier molecules (e.g.,HSA, PEGs)\n\n\nViscosity is a parameter of high importance with regard to antibody manufacture and antibody processing (e.g.,diafiltration/ultrafiltration), fill-finish processes (pumping aspects, filtration aspects) and delivery aspects (syringeability, sophisticated device delivery). Low viscosities enable the liquid solution of the antibody having a higher concentration. This enables the same dose may be administered in smaller volumes. Small injection volumes inhere the advantage of lower pain on injection sensations, and the solutions not necessarily have to be isotonic to reduce pain on injection in the patient. The viscosity of the antibody solution may be such that at shear rates of 100 (1/s) antibody solution viscosity is below 200 mPa s, in an embodiment below 125 mPa s, in another embodiment below 70 mPa s, and in yet another embodiment below 25 mPa s or even below 10 mPa s.\n\n\nB 5.3. Production efficiency\n\n\nThe generation of a DVD-Ig that is efficiently expressed in mammalian cells, such as\n\n\nChinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), will in an embodiment require two parental monoclonal antibodies which are themselves expressed efficiently in mammalian cells. The production yield from a stable mammalian line (i.e., CHO) should be above about 0.5g/L, in an embodiment above about lg/L, and in another embodiment in the range of about 2-5 g/L or more (Kipriyanov SM, Little M. 1999 MoI Biotechnol. 12:173-201 ; Carroll S, Al-Rubeai M. 2004 Expert Opin Biol Ther. 4:1821-9).\n\n\nProduction of antibodies and Ig fusion proteins in mammalian cells is influenced by several factors. Engineering of the expression vector via incorporation of strong promoters, enhancers and selection markers can maximize transcription of the gene of interest from an integrated vector copy. The identification of vector integration sites that are permissive for high levels of gene transcription can augment protein expression from a vector (Wurm et al, 2004, Nature Biotechnology , 2004, Vol/Iss/Pg. 22/11 (1393-1398)). Furthermore, levels of production are affected by the ratio of antibody heavy and light chains and various steps in the process of protein assembly and secretion (Jiang et al. 2006, Biotechnology Progress, Jan-Feb 2006, vol. 22, no. 1, p. 313-8).\n\n\nB 6. Immunogenicity\n\n\nAdministration of a therapeutic mAb may results in certain incidence of an immune response (ie, the formation of endogenous antibodies directed against the therapeutic mAb). \n\n Potential elements that might induce immunogenicity should be analyzed during selection of the parental monoclonal antibodies, and steps to reduce such risk can be taken to optimize the parental monoclonal antibodies prior to DVD-Ig construction. Mouse-derived antibodies have been found to be highly immunogenic in patients. The generation of chimeric antibodies comprised of mouse variable and human constant regions presents a logical next step to reduce the immunogenicity of therapeutic antibodies (Morrison and Schlom, 1990). Alternatively, immunogenicity can be reduced by transferring murine CDR sequences into a human antibody framework (reshaping/CDR grafting/humanization), as described for a therapeutic antibody by Riechmann et al., 1988. Another method is referred to as \"resurfacing\" or \"veneering\", starting with the rodent variable light and heavy domains, only surface-accessible framework amino acids are altered to human ones, while the CDR and buried amino acids remain from the parental rodent antibody (Roguska et al., 1996). In another type of humanization, instead of grafting the entire CDRs, one technique grafts only the \"specificity-determining regions\" (SDRs), defined as the subset of CDR residues that are involved in binding of the antibody to its target (Kashmiri et al., 2005). This necessitates identification of the SDRs either through analysis of available three- dimensional structures of antibody-target complexes or mutational analysis of the antibody CDR residues to determine which interact with the target. Alternatively, fully human antibodies may have reduced immunogenicity compared to murine, chimeric or humanized antibodies.\n\n\nAnother approach to reduce the immunogenicity of therapeutic antibodies is the elimination of certain specific sequences that are predicted to be immunogenic. In one approach, after a first generation biologic has been tested in humans and found to be unacceptably immunogenic, the B-cell epitopes can be mapped and then altered to avoid immune detection. Another approach uses methods to predict and remove potential T-cell epitopes. Computational methods have been developed to scan and to identify the peptide sequences of biologic therapeutics with the potential to bind to MHC proteins (Desmet et al., 2005). Alternatively a human dendritic cell-based method can be used to identify CD4\n+\n T-cell epitopes in potential protein allergens (Stickler et al., 2005; S.L. Morrison and J. Schlom, Important Adv. Oncol. (1990), pp. 3-18; Riechmann, L., Clark, M., Waldmann, H. and Winter, G. \"Reshaping human antibodies for therapy .\" Nature (1988) 332: 323-327; Roguska-M-A, Pedersen-J-T, Henry-A-H, Searle-S-M, Roja-C-M, Avery-B, Hoffee-M, Cook-S, Lambert-J-M, Blattler-W-A, Rees-A-R, Guild-B-C.

In vivo efficacy\n\n\nTo generate a DVD-Ig molecule with desired in vivo efficacy, it is important to generate and select mAbs with similarly desired in vivo efficacy when given in combination. However, in some instances the DVD-Ig may exhibit in vivo efficacy that cannot be achieved with the combination of two separate mAbs. For instance, a DVD-Ig may bring two targets in close proximity leading to an activity that cannot be achieved with the combination of two separate mAbs. Additional desirable biological functions are described herein in section B 3. Parent antibodies with characteristics desirable in the DVD-Ig molecule may be selected based on factors such as pharmacokinetic 1 \n1\nA; tissue distribution; soluble versus cell surface targets; and target concentration- soluble/density -surface.\n\n\nB 8. In vivo tissue distribution\n\n\nTo generate a DVD-Ig molecule with desired in vivo tissue distribution, in an embodiment parent mAbs with similar desired in vivo tissue distribution profile must be selected. Alternatively, based on the mechanism of the dual-specific targeting strategy, it may at other times not be required to select parent mAbs with the similarly desired in vivo tissue distribution when given in combination. For instance, in the case of a DVD-Ig in which one binding component targets the DVD-Ig to a specific site thereby bringing the second binding component to the same target site. For example, one binding specificity of a DVD-Ig could target pancreas (islet cells) and the other specificity could bring GLPl to the pancreas to induce insulin.\n\n\nB 9. Isotype:\n\n\nTo generate a DVD-Ig molecule with desired properties including, but not limited to, Isotype, Effector functions and the circulating half-life, in an embodiment parent mAbs with appropriate Fc-effector functions depending on the therapeutic utility and the desired therapeutic end-point are selected. There are five main heavy-chain classes or isotypes some of which have several sub-types and these determine the effector functions of an antibody molecule. These effector functions reside in the hinge region, CH2 and CH3 domains of the antibody molecule. However, residues in other parts of an antibody molecule may have effects on effector functions \n\n as well. The hinge region Fc-effector functions include: (i) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, (ii) complement (CIq) binding, activation and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), (iii) phagocytosis/clearance of antigen-antibody complexes, and (iv) cytokine release in some instances. These Fc-effector functions of an antibody molecule are mediated through the interaction of the Fc-region with a set of class-specific cell surface receptors. Antibodies of the IgGl isotype are most active while IgG2 and IgG4 having minimal or no effector functions. The effector functions of the IgG antibodies are mediated through interactions with three structurally homologous cellular Fc receptor types (and sub-types) (FcgRl, FcgRII and FcgRIII). These effector functions of an IgGl can be eliminated by mutating specific amino acid residues in the lower hinge region (e.g.,L234A, L235A) that are required for FcgR and CIq binding. Amino acid residues in the Fc region, in particular the CH2-CH3 domains, also determine the circulating half- life of the antibody molecule. This Fc function is mediated through the binding of the Fc-region to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) which is responsible for recycling of antibody molecules from the acidic lysosomes back to the general circulation.\n\n\nWhether a mAb should have an active or an inactive isotype will depend on the desired therapeutic end-point for an antibody. Some examples of usage of isotypes and desired therapeutic outcome are listed below:\n\n\na) If the desired end-point is functional neutralization of a soluble cytokine then an inactive isotype may be used;\n\n\nb) If the desired out-come is clearance of a pathological protein an active isotype may be used;\n\n\nc) If the desired out-come is clearance of protein aggregates an active isotype may be used;\n\n\nd) If the desired outcome is to antagonize a surface receptor an inactive isotype is used (Tysabri, IgG4; OKT3, mutated IgGl);\n\n\ne) If the desired outcome is to eliminate target cells an active isotype is used (Herceptin,\n\n\nIgGl (and with enhanced effector functions); and\n\n\nf) If the desired outcome is to clear proteins from circulation without entering the CNS an IgM isotype may be used (e.g.,clearing circulating Ab peptide species).\n\n\nThe Fc effector functions of a parental mAb can be determined by various in vitro methods well known in the art. \n\n As discussed, the selection of isotype, and thereby the effector functions will depend upon the desired therapeutic end-point. In cases where simple neutralization of a circulating target is desired, for example blocking receptor-ligand interactions, the effector functions may not be required. In such instances isotypes or mutations in the Fc-region of an antibody that eliminate effector functions are desirable. In other instances where elimination of target cells is the therapeutic end-point, for example elimination of tumor cells, isotypes or mutations or de- fucosylation in the Fc-region that enhance effector functions are desirable (Presta GL, Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 58:640-656, 2006; Satoh M., Iida S., Shitara K. Expert Opinion Biol. Ther. 6:1161-1173, 2006). Similarly, depending up on the therapeutic utility, the circulating half-life of an antibody molecule can be reduced/prolonged by modulating antibody-FcRn interactions by introducing specific mutations in the Fc region (Dall'Acqua WF, Kiener PA, Wu H. J. Biol. Chem. 281 :23514-23524, 2006; Petkova SB., Akilesh S., Sproule TJ. et al. Internal Immunol. 18:1759-1769, 2006; Vaccaro C, Bawdon R., Wanjie S et al. PNAS 103:18709-18714, 2007).\n\n\nThe published information on the various residues that influence the different effector functions of a normal therapeutic mAb may need to be confirmed for DVD-Ig. It may be possible that in a DVD-Ig format additional (different) Fc-region residues, other than those identified for the modulation of monoclonal antibody effector functions, may be important.\n\n\nOverall, the decision as to which Fc-effector functions (isotype) will be critical in the final DVD-Ig format will depend up on the disease indication, therapeutic target, desired therapeutic end-point and safety considerations. Listed below are exemplary appropriate heavy chain and light chain constant regions including, but not limited to:\n\n\no IgGl - allotype: Glmz\n\n\no IgGl mutant - A234, A235\n\n\no IgG2 - allotype: G2m(n-)\n\n\no Kappa - Km3\n\n\no Lambda\n\n\nFc Receptor and CIq Studies: The possibility of unwanted antibody-dependent cell- mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) by antibody complexing to any overexpressed target on cell membranes can be abrogated by the (for example, L234A, L235A) hinge-region mutations. These substituted amino acids, present in the IgGl hinge region of mAb, are expected to result in diminished binding of mAb to human Fc receptors \n\n (but not FcRn), as FcgR binding is thought to occur within overlapping sites on the IgGl hinge region. This feature of mAb may lead to an improved safety profile over antibodies containing a wild-type IgG. Binding of mAb to human Fc receptors can be determined by flow cytometry experiments using cell lines (e.g.,THP-l, K562) and an engineered CHO cell line that expresses F cgRIIb (or other FcgRs). Compared to IgGl control monoclonal antibodies, mAb show reduced binding to FcgRI and FcgRIIa whereas binding to FcgRIIb is unaffected. The binding and activation of CIq by antigen/IgG immune complexes triggers the classical complement cascade with consequent inflammatory and/or immunoregulatory responses. The CIq binding site on IgGs has been localized to residues within the IgG hinge region. CIq binding to increasing concentrations of mAb was assessed by CIq ELISA. The results demonstrate that mAb is unable to bind to CIq, as expected when compared to the binding of a wildtype control IgGl . Overall, the L234A, L235A hinge region mutation abolishes binding of mAb to FcgRI, FcgRIIa and CIq but does not impact the interaction of mAb with FcgRIIb. This data suggests that in vivo, mAb with mutant Fc will interact normally with the inhibitory FcgRIIb but will likely fail to interact with the activating FcgRI and FcgRIIa receptors or CIq.\n\n\nHuman FcRn binding: The neonatal receptor (FcRn) is responsible for transport of IgG across the placenta and to control the catabolic half-life of the IgG molecules. It might be desirable to increase the terminal half-life of an antibody to improve efficacy, to reduce the dose or frequency of administration, or to improve localization to the target. Alternatively, it might be advantageous to do the converse that is, to decrease the terminal half-life of an antibody to reduce whole body exposure or to improve the target-to-non-target binding ratios. Tailoring the interaction between IgG and its salvage receptor, FcRn, offers a way to increase or decrease the terminal half-life of IgG. Proteins in the circulation, including IgG, are taken up in the fluid phase through micropinocytosis by certain cells, such as those of the vascular endothelia. IgG can bind FcRn in endosomes under slightly acidic conditions (pH 6.0-6.5) and can recycle to the cell surface, where it is released under almost neutral conditions (pH 7.0-7.4). Mapping of the Fc- region-binding site on FcRn80, 16, 17 showed that two histidine residues that are conserved across species, His310 and His435, are responsible for the pH dependence of this interaction. Using phage -display technology, a mouse Fc-region mutation that increases binding to FcRn and extends the half-life of mouse IgG was identified (see Victor, G. et al.; Nature Biotechnology\n\n\n(1997), 15(7), 637-640). Fc-region mutations that increase the binding affinity of human IgG for FcRn at pH 6.0, but not at pH 7.4, have also been identified (see DallAcqua William F, et al., Journal of Immunology (2002), 169(9), 5171-80). Moreover, in one case, a similar pH-dependent increase in binding (up to 27-fold) was also observed for rhesus FcRn, and this resulted in a twofold increase in serum half-life in rhesus monkeys compared with the parent IgG (see Hinton, Paul R. et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry (2004), 279(8), 6213-6216). These findings \n\n indicate that it is feasible to extend the plasma half-life of antibody therapeutics by tailoring the interaction of the Fc region with FcRn. Conversely, Fc-region mutations that attenuate interaction with FcRn can reduce antibody half-life.\n\n\nB.10 Pharmacokinetics (PK):\n\n\nTo generate a DVD-Ig molecule with desired pharmacokinetic profile, in an embodiment parent mAbs with the similarly desired pharmacokinetic profile are selected. One consideration is that immunogenic response to monoclonal antibodies (ie, HAHA, human anti-human antibody response; HACA, human anti-chimeric antibody response) further complicates the pharmacokinetics of these therapeutic agents. In an embodiment, monoclonal antibodies with minimal or no immunogenicity are used for constructing DVD-Ig molecules such that the resulting DVD-Igs will also have minimal or no immunogenicity. Some of the factors that determine the PK of a mAb include, but are not limited to, Intrinsic properties of the mAb (VH amino acid sequence); immunogenicity; FcRn binding and Fc functions.\n\n\nThe PK profile of selected parental monoclonal antibodies can be easily determined in rodents as the PK profile in rodents correlates well with (or closely predicts) the PK profile of monoclonal antibodies in cynomolgus monkey and humans. The PK profile is determined as described in Example section I.2.2.3.A.\n\n\nAfter the parental monoclonal antibodies with desired PK characteristics (and other desired functional properties as discussed herein) are selected, the DVD-Ig is constructed. As the DVD-Ig molecules contain two antigen-binding domains from two parental monoclonal antibodies, the PK properties of the DVD-Ig are assessed as well. Therefore, while determining the PK properties of the DVD-Ig, PK assays may be employed that determine the PK profile based on functionality of both antigen-binding domains derived from the 2 parent monoclonal antibodies. The PK profile of a DVD-Ig can be determined as described in Example 1.2.2.3.A. Additional factors that may impact the PK profile of DVD-Ig include the antigen-binding domain (CDR) orientation; Linker size; and Fc / FcRn interactions. PK characteristics of parent antibodies can be evaluated by assessing the following parameters: absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion.\n\n\nAbsorption: To date, administration of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies is via parenteral routes (e.g., intravenous [IV], subcutaneous [SC], or intramuscular [IM]). Absorption of a mAb into the systemic circulation following either SC or IM administration from the interstitial space is primarily through the lymphatic pathway. Saturable, presystemic, proteolytic degradation may result in variable absolute bioavailability following extravascular administration. \n\n Usually, increases in absolute bioavailability with increasing doses of monoclonal antibodies may be observed due to saturated proteolytic capacity at higher doses. The absorption process for a mAb is usually quite slow as the lymph fluid drains slowly into the vascular system, and the duration of absorption may occur over hours to several days.The absolute bioavailability of monoclonal antibodies following SC administration generally ranges from 50% to 100%. In the case of a transport-mediating structure at the blood-brain barrier targeted by the DVD-Ig construct, circulation times in plasma may be reduced due to enhanced trans-cellular transport at the blood brain barrier (BBB) into the CNS compartment, where the DVD-Ig is liberated to enable interaction via its second antigen recognition site.\n\n\nDistribution: Following IV administration, monoclonal antibodies usually follow a biphasic serum (or plasma) concentration-time profile, beginning with a rapid distribution phase, followed by a slow elimination phase. In general, a biexponential pharmacokinetic model best describes this kind of pharmacokinetic profile. The volume of distribution in the central compartment (Vc) for a mAb is usually equal to or slightly larger than the plasma volume (2-3 liters). A distinct biphasic pattern in serum (plasma) concentration versus time profile may not be apparent with other parenteral routes of administration, such as IM or SC, because the distribution phase of the serum (plasma) concentration-time curve is masked by the long absorption portion. Many factors, including physicochemical properties, site-specific and target-oriented receptor mediated uptake, binding capacity of tissue, and mAb dose can influence biodistribution of a mAb. Some of these factors can contribute to nonlinearity in biodistribution for a mAb.\n\n\nMetabolism and Excretion: Due to the molecular size, intact monoclonal antibodies are not excreted into the urine via kidney. They are primarily inactivated by metabolism (e.g., catabolism). For IgG-based therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, half-lives typically ranges from hours or 1 -2 days to over 20 days. The elimination of a mAb can be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, affinity for the FcRn receptor, immunogenicity of the mAb, the degree of glycosylation of the mAb, the susceptibility for the mAb to proteolysis, and receptor- mediated elimination.\n\n\nB.ll Tissue cross-reactivity pattern on human and tox species:\n\n\nIdentical staining pattern suggests that potential human toxicity can be evaluated in tox species. Tox species are those animal in which unrelated toxicity is studied. \n\n The individual antibodies are selected to meet two criteria. (1) Tissue staining appropriate for the known expression of the antibody target. (2) Similar staining pattern between human and tox species tissues from the same organ.\n\n\nCriterion 1 : Immunizations and/or antibody selections typically employ recombinant or synthesized antigens (proteins, carbohydrates or other molecules). Binding to the natural counterpart and counterscreen against unrelated antigens are often part of the screening funnel for therapeutic antibodies. However, screening against a multitude of antigens is often unpractical. Therefore tissue cross-reactivity studies with human tissues from all major organs serve to rule out unwanted binding of the antibody to any unrelated antigens.\n\n\nCriterion 2: Comparative tissue cross reactivity studies with human and tox species tissues (cynomolgus monkey, dog, possibly rodents and others, the same 36 or 37 tissues are being tested as in the human study) help to validate the selection of a tox species. In the typical tissue cross-reactivity studies on frozen tissues sections therapeutic antibodies may demonstrate the expected binding to the known antigen and/or to a lesser degree binding to tissues based either on low level interactions (unspecific binding, low level binding to similar antigens, low level charge based interactions etc.). In any case the most relevant toxicology animal species is the one with the highest degree of coincidence of binding to human and animal tissue.\n\n\nTissue cross reactivity studies follow the appropriate regulatory guidelines including EC CPMP Guideline 111/5271/94 \"Production and quality control of mAbs\" and the 1997 US FDA/CBER \"Points to Consider in the Manufacture and Testing of Monoclonal Antibody\n\n\nProducts for Human Use\". . Cryosections (5 μm) of human tissues obtained at autopsy or biopsy were fixed and dried on object glass. The peroxidase staining of tissue sections was performed, using the avidin-biotin system. FDA's Guidance \"Points to Consider in the Manufacture and Testing of Monoclonal Antibody Products for Human Use\". Relevant references include Clarke J 2004, Boon L. 2002a, Boon L 2002b, Ryan A 1999.\n\n\nTissue cross reactivity studies are often done in two stages, with the first stage including cryosections of 32 tissues (typically: Adrenal Gland, Gastrointestinal Tract, Prostate, Bladder, Heart, Skeletal Muscle, Blood Cells, Kidney, Skin, Bone Marrow, Liver, Spinal Cord, Breast, Lung, Spleen, Cerebellum, Lymph Node, Testes, Cerebral Cortex, Ovary, Thymus, Colon, Pancreas, Thyroid, Endothelium, Parathyroid, Ureter, Eye, Pituitary, Uterus, Fallopian Tube and Placenta) from one human donor. In the second phase a full cross reactivity study is performed with up to 38 tissues (including adrenal, blood, blood vessel, bone marrow, cerebellum, cerebrum, cervix, esophagus, eye, heart, kidney, large intestine, liver, lung, lymph node, breast mammary gland, ovary, oviduct, pancreas, parathyroid, peripheral nerve, pituitary, placenta, prostate, \n\n salivary gland, skin, small intestine, spinal cord, spleen, stomach, striated muscle, testis, thymus, thyroid, tonsil, ureter, urinary bladder, and uterus) from 3 unrelated adults. Studies are done typically at minimally two dose levels.\n\n\nThe therapeutic antibody (i.e. test article) and isotype matched control antibody may be biotinylated for avidin-biotin complex (ABC) detection; other detection methods may include tertiary antibody detection for a FITC (or otherwise) labeled test article, or precomplexing with a labeled anti-human IgG for an unlabeled test article.\n\n\nBriefly, cryosections (about 5 μm) of human tissues obtained at autopsy or biopsy are fixed and dried on object glass. The peroxidase staining of tissue sections is performed, using the avidin-biotin system. First (in case of a precomplexing detection system), the test article is incubated with the secondary biotinylated anti-human IgG and developed into immune complex. The immune complex at the final concentrations of 2 and 10 μg/mL of test article is added onto tissue sections on object glass and then the tissue sections were reacted for 30 minutes with a avidin-biotin-peroxidase kit. Subsequently, DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine), a substrate for the peroxidase reaction, was applied for 4 minutes for tissue staining. Antigen-Sepharose beads are used as positive control tissue sections.\n\n\nAny specific staining is judged to be either an expected (e.g.,consistent with antigen expression) or unexpected reactivity based upon known expression of the target antigen in question. Any staining judged specific is scored for intensity and frequency. Antigen or serum competion or blocking studies can assist further in determining whether observed staining is specific or nonspecific.\n\n\nIf two selected antibodies are found to meet the selction criteria - appropriate tissue staining, matching staining between human and toxicology animal specific tissue - they can be selected for DVD-Ig generation.\n\n\nThe tissue cross reactivity study has to be repeated with the final DVD-Ig construct, but while these studies follow the same protocol as outline herein, they are more complex to evaluate because any binding can come from any of the two parent antibodies, and any unexplained binding needs to be confirmed with complex antigen competition studies.\n\n\nIt is readily apparent that the complex undertaking of tissue crossreactivity studies with a multispecific molecule like a DVD-Ig is greatly simplified if the two parental antibodies are selected for (1) lack of unexpected tissue cross reactivity findings and (2) for appropriate similarity of tissue cross reactivity findings between the corresponding human and toxicology animal species tissues. \n\n B.12 Specificity and selectivity:\n\n\nTo generate a DVD-Ig molecule with desired specificity and selectivity, one needs to generate and select parent mAbs with the similarly desired specificity and selectivity profile.\n\n\nBinding studies for specificity and selectivity with a DVD-Ig can be complex due to the four or more binding sites, two each for each antigen. Briefly, binding studies using ELISA,\n\n\nBIAcore. KinExA or other interaction studies with a DVD-Ig need to monitor the binding of one, two or more antigens to the DVD-Ig molecule. While BIAcore technology can resolve the sequential, independent binding of multiple antigens, more traditional methods including ELISA or more modern techniques like KinExA cannot. Therefore careful characterization of each parent antibody is critical. After each individual antibody has been characterized for specificity, confirmation of specificity retention of the individual binding sites in the DVD-Ig molecule is greatly simplified.\n\n\nIt is readily apparent that the complex undertaking of determining the specificity of a DVD-Ig is greatly simplified if the two parental antibodies are selected for specificity prior to being combined into a DVD-Ig.\n\n\nAntigen-antibody interaction studies can take many forms, including many classical protein protein interaction studies, including ELISA (Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay), Mass spectrometry, chemical cross linking, SEC with light scattering, equilibrium dialysis, gel permeation, ultrafiltration, gel chromatography, large-zone analytical SEC, micropreparative ultracentrigugation (sedimentation equilibrium), spectroscopic methods, titration microcalorimetry, sedimentation equilibrium (in analytical ultracentrifuge), sedimentation velocity (in analytical centrifuge), surface plasmon resonance (including BIAcore).

Margulies, Ethan M. Shevach, Warren Strober (eds.) published by John Wiley & Sons Inc and relevant references included therein.\n\n\nCytokine Release in Whole Blood: The interaction of mAb with human blood cells can be investigated by a cytokine release assay (Wing, M. G. Therapeutic Immunology (1995), 2(4), 183-190; \"Current Protocols in Pharmacology\", SJ. Enna, Michael Williams, John W. Ferkany, Terry Kenakin, Paul Moser, (eds.) published by John Wiley & Sons Inc; Madhusudan, S. Clinical Cancer Research (2004), 10(19), 6528-6534; Cox, J. Methods (2006), 38(4), 274-282; Choi, I. European Journal of Immunology (2001), 31(1), 94-106). Briefly, various concentrations of mAb \n\n are incubated with human whole blood for 24 hours. The concentration tested should cover a wide range including final concentrations mimicking typical blood levels in patients (including but not limited to 100 ng/ml - 1 OOμg/ml). Following the incubation, supernatants and cell lysates were analyzed for the presence of IL-lRα, TNF-α, IL-Ib, IL-6 and IL-8. Cytokine concentration profiles generated for mAb were compared to profiles produced by a negative human IgG control and a positive LPS or PHA control. The cytokine profile displayed by mAb from both cell supernatants and cell lysates was comparable to control human IgG. In an embodiment, the monoclonal antibody does not interact with human blood cells to spontaneously release inflammatory cytokines.\n\n\nCytokine release studies for a DVD-Ig are complex due to the four or more binding sites, two each for each antigen. Briefly, cytokine release studies as described herein measure the effect of the whole DVD-Ig molecule on whole blood or other cell systems, but can resolve which portion of the molecule causes cytokine release. Once cytokine release has been detected, the purity of the DVD-Ig preparation has to be ascertained, because some co-purifying cellular components can cause cytokine release on their own. If purity is not the issue, fragmentation of DVD-Ig (including but not limited to removal of Fc portion, separation of binding sites etc.), binding site mutagenesis or other methods may need to be employed to deconvolute any observations. It is readily apparent that this complex undertaking is greatly simplified if the two parental antibodies are selected for lack of cytokine release prior to being combined into a DVD- Ig.\n\n\nB.13 Cross reactivity to other species for toxicological studies:\n\n\nIn an embodiment, the individual antibodies selected with sufficient cross-reactivity to appropriate tox species, for example, cynomolgus monkey. Parental antibodies need to bind to orthologous species target (i.e. cynomolgus monkey) and elicit appropriate response (modulation, neutralization, activation). In an embodiment, the cross-reactivity (affinity /potency) to orthologous species target should be within 10-fold of the human target. In practice, the parental antibodies are evaluated for multiple species, including mouse, rat, dog, monkey (and other non- human primates), as well as disease model species (i.e. sheep for asthma model). The acceptable cross-reactivity to tox species from the perantal monoclonal antibodies allows future toxicology studies of DVD-Ig-Ig in the same species. For that reason, the two parental monoclonal antibodies should have acceptable cross-reactivity for a common tox species therefore allowing toxicology studies of DVD-Ig in the same species.\n\n\nParent inAbs may be selected from various inAbs capable of binding specific targets and well known in the art. These include, but are not limited to anti-TNF antibody (US Patent No. \n\n 6,258,562), anti-IL-12 and/or anti-IL-12p40 antibody (US Patent No. 6,914,128); anti-IL-18 antibody (US 2005/0147610 Al), anti-C5, anti-CBL, anti-CD147, anti-gpl20, anti-VLA-4, anti- CDl Ia, anti-CD18, anti-VEGF, anti-CD40L, anti CD-40 (e.g., see WO2007124299) anti-Id, anti- ICAM-I, anti-CXCL13, anti-CD2, anti-EGFR, anti-TGF-beta 2, anti-HGF, anti-cMet, anti DLL- 4, anti-NPRl, anti-PLGF, anti-ErbB3, anti-E-selectin, anti-Fact VII, anti-Her2/neu, anti-F gp, anti-CDl l/18, anti-CD14, anti-ICAM-3, anti-RON, anti CD-19, anti-CD80 (e.g., see WO2003039486, anti-CD4, anti-CD3, anti-CD23, anti-beta2-integrin, anti-alpha4beta7, anti- CD52, anti-HLA DR, anti-CD22 (e.g., see US Patent NO: 5,789,554), anti-CD20, anti-MIF, anti- CD64 (FcR), anti-TCR alpha beta, anti-CD2, anti-Hep B, anti-CA 125, anti-EpCAM, anti-gpl20, anti-CMV, anti-gpllbllla, anti-IgE, anti-CD25, anti-CD33, anti-HLA, anti-IGFl,2, anti IGFR, anti-VNRintegrin, anti -IL-I alpha, anti-IL-lbeta, anti-IL-1 receptor, anti-IL-2 receptor, anti-IL-4, anti-IL-4 receptor, anti-IL5, anti-IL-5 receptor, anti-IL-6, anti- IL-6R, RANKL, NGF, DKK, alphaVbeta3, IL-17A, anti-IL-8, anti-IL-9, anti-IL-13, anti-IL-13 receptor, anti-IL-17, and anti- IL-23; IL-23pl9; (see Presta LG. 2005 Selection, design, and engineering of therapeutic antibodies J Allergy Clin Immunol. 116:731-6 and http://www.path.cam.ac.uk/~mrc7/humanisation/antibodies.html \n\"\n).\n\n\nParent mAbs may also be selected from various therapeutic antibodies approved for use, in clinical trials, or in development for clinical use.

Construction of DVD molecules:\n\n\nThe dual variable domain immunoglobulin (DVD-Ig) molecule is designed such that two different light chain variable domains (VL) from the two different parent monoclonal antibodies are linked in tandem directly or via a short linker by recombinant DNA techniques, followed by the light chain constant domain. Similarly, the heavy chain comprises two different heavy chain variable domains (VH) linked in tandem, followed by the constant domain CHl and Fc region (Fig.lA).\n\n\nThe variable domains can be obtained using recombinant DNA techniques from a parent antibody generated by any one of the methods described herein. In an embodiment, the variable domain is a murine heavy or light chain variable domain. In another embodiment, the variable domain is a CDR grafted or a humanized variable heavy or light chain domain. In an embodiment, the variable domain is a human heavy or light chain variable domain.\n\n\nIn one embodiment the first and second variable domains are linked directly to each other using recombinant DNA techniques. In another embodiment the variable domains are linked via a linker sequence. In an embodiment, two variable domains are linked. Three or more variable domains may also be linked directly or via a linker sequence. The variable domains may bind the same antigen or may bind different antigens. DVD molecules of the invention may include one immunoglobulin variable domain and one non- immunoglobulin variable domain such as ligand binding domain of a receptor, active domain of an enzyme. DVD molecules may also comprise 2 or more non-Ig domains.\n\n\nThe linker sequence may be a single amino acid or a polypeptide sequence. In an embodiment, the linker sequences are selected from the group consisting of AKTTPKLEEGEFSEAR (SEQ ID NO: 1); AKTTPKLEEGEF SEARV (SEQ ID NO: 2); AKTTPKLGG (SEQ ID NO: 3); SAKTTPKLGG (SEQ ID NO: 4); SAKTTP (SEQ ID NO: 5); RADAAP (SEQ ID NO: 6); RADAAPTVS (SEQ ID NO: 7); RADAAAAGGPGS (SEQ ID NO: 8); RADAAAA(G\n4\nS)\n4\n (SEQ ID NO: 9)\n,\n S AKTTPKLEEGEF SEARV (SEQ ID NO: 10); ADAAP (SEQ ID NO: 11); ADAAPTVSIFPP (SEQ ID NO: 12); TVAAP (SEQ ID NO: 13); TVAAPSVFIFPP (SEQ ID NO: 14); QPKAAP (SEQ ID NO: 15); QPKAAPSVTLFPP (SEQ ID NO: 16); AKTTPP (SEQ ID NO: 17); AKTTPPSVTPLAP (SEQ ID NO: 18); AKTTAP (SEQ ID \n\n NO: 19); AKTT APSVYPLAP (SEQ ID NO: 20); ASTKGP (SEQ ID NO: 21); ASTKGPSVFPLAP (SEQ ID NO: 22), GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 23); GENKVEYAPALMALS (SEQ ID NO: 24); GP AKELTPLKE AKV S (SEQ ID NO: 25); and GHEAAAVMQVQYPAS (SEQ ID NO: 26). The choice of linker sequences is based on crystal structure analysis of several Fab molecules. There is a natural flexible linkage between the variable domain and the CH1/CL constant domain in Fab or antibody molecular structure. This natural linkage comprises approximately 10-12 amino acid residues, contributed by 4-6 residues from C-terminus of V domain and 4-6 residues from the N-terminus of CL/CH1 domain. DVD Igs of the invention were generated using N-terminal 5-6 amino acid residues, or 11-12 amino acid residues, of CL or CHl as linker in light chain and heavy chain of DVD-Ig, respectively. The N-terminal residues of CL or CHl domains, particularly the first 5-6 amino acid residues, adopt a loop conformation without strong secondary structures, therefore can act as flexible linkers between the two variable domains. The N-terminal residues of CL or CHl domains are natural extension of the variable domains, as they are part of the Ig sequences, therefore minimize to a large extent any immunogenicity potentially arising from the linkers and junctions.\n\n\nOther linker sequences may include any sequence of any length of CL/CH1 domain but not all residues of CL/CH1 domain; for example the first 5-12 amino acid residues of the CL/CH1 domains; the light chain linkers can be from CK or Cλ; and the heavy chain linkers can be derived from CHl of any isotypes, including Cγl, Cγ2, Cγ3, Cγ4, Cαl, Cα2, Cδ, Cε, and Cμ. Linker sequences may also be derived from other proteins such as Ig-like proteins, (e.g.TCR, FcR, KIR); G/S based sequences (e.g G4S repeats; SEQ ID NO: 27); hinge region-derived sequences; and other natural sequences from other proteins.\n\n\nIn an embodiment a constant domain is linked to the two linked variable domains using recombinant DNA techniques. In an embodiment, sequence comprising linked heavy chain variable domains is linked to a heavy chain constant domain and sequence comprising linked light chain variable domains is linked to a light chain constant domain. In an embodiment, the constant domains are human heavy chain constant domain and human light chain constant domain respectively. In an embodiment, the DVD heavy chain is further linked to an Fc region. The Fc region may be a native sequence Fc region, or a variant Fc region. In another embodiment, the Fc region is a human Fc region. In another embodiment the Fc region includes Fc region from IgGl , IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, IgM, IgE, or IgD.\n\n\nIn another embodiment two heavy chain DVD polypeptides and two light chain DVD polypeptides are combined to form a DVD-Ig molecule. Table 2 lists amino acid sequences of VH and VL regions of exemplary antibodies for targets useful for treating disease, e.g., for \n\n treating cancer. In an embodiment, the invention provides a DVD comprising at least two of the VH and/or VL regions listed in Table 2, in any orientation.\n\n\nTable 2: List of Amino Acid Sequences of VH and VL regions of Antibodies for Generating DVD-Igs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed description of specific DVD-Ig molecules capable of binding specific targets, and methods of making the same, is provided in the Examples section below.\n\n\nC. Production of DVD proteins\n\n\nBinding proteins of the present invention may be produced by any of a number of techniques known in the art. For example, expression from host cells, wherein expression vector(s) encoding the DVD heavy and DVD light chains is (are) transfected into a host cell by standard techniques. The various forms of the term \"transfection\" are intended to encompass a wide variety of techniques commonly used for the introduction of exogenous DNA into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell, e.g., electroporation, calcium-phosphate precipitation, DEAE- dextran transfection and the like. Although it is possible to express the DVD proteins of the invention in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells, DVD proteins are expressed in eukaryotic cells, for example, mammalian host cells, because such eukaryotic cells (and in particular mammalian cells) are more likely than prokaryotic cells to assemble and secrete a properly folded and immunologically active DVD protein.\n\n\nExemplary mammalian host cells for expressing the recombinant antibodies of the invention include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) (including dhfr- CHO cells, described in Urlaub and Chasin, (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA 77:4216-4220, used with a DHFR selectable marker, e.g., as described in RJ. Kaufman and P.A. Sharp (1982) MoI. Biol. 159:601- 621), NSO myeloma cells, COS cells, SP2 and PER.C6 cells. When recombinant expression vectors encoding DVD proteins are introduced into mammalian host cells, the DVD proteins are produced by culturing the host cells for a period of time sufficient to allow for expression of the DVD proteins in the host cells or secretion of the DVD proteins into the culture medium in which the host cells are grown. DVD proteins can be recovered from the culture medium using standard protein purification methods.\n\n\nIn an exemplary system for recombinant expression of DVD proteins of the invention, a recombinant expression vector encoding both the DVD heavy chain and the DVD light chain is introduced into dhfr- CHO cells by calcium phosphate -mediated transfection. Within the \n\n recombinant expression vector, the DVD heavy and light chain genes are each operatively linked to CMV enhancer/ AdMLP promoter regulatory elements to drive high levels of transcription of the genes. The recombinant expression vector also carries a DHFR gene, which allows for selection of CHO cells that have been transfected with the vector using methotrexate selection/amplification. The selected transformant host cells are cultured to allow for expression of the DVD heavy and light chains and intact DVD protein is recovered from the culture medium. Standard molecular biology techniques are used to prepare the recombinant expression vector, transfect the host cells, select for transformants, culture the host cells and recover the DVD protein from the culture medium. Still further the invention provides a method of synthesizing a DVD protein of the invention by culturing a host cell of the invention in a suitable culture medium until a DVD protein of the invention is synthesized. The method can further comprise isolating the DVD protein from the culture medium.\n\n\nAn important feature of DVD-Ig is that it can be produced and purified in a similar way as a conventional antibody. The production of DVD-Ig results in a homogeneous, single major product with desired dual-specific activity, without any sequence modification of the constant region or chemical modifications of any kind. Other previously described methods to generate \"bi-specific\", \"multi-specific\", and \"multi-specific multivalent\" full length binding proteins do not lead to a single primary product but instead lead to the intracellular or secreted production of a mixture of assembled inactive, mono-specific, multi-specific, multivalent, full length binding proteins, and multivalent full length binding proteins with combination of different binding sites. As an example, based on the design described by Miller and Presta (PCT publication WO2001/077342(Al), there are 16 possible combinations of heavy and light chains. Consequently only 6.25% of protein is likely to be in the desired active form, and not as a single major product or single primary product compared to the other 15 possible combinations. Separation of the desired, fully active forms of the protein from inactive and partially active forms of the protein using standard chromatography techniques, typically used in large scale manufacturing, is yet to be demonstrated.\n\n\nSurprisingly the design of the \"dual-specific multivalent full length binding proteins\" of the present invention leads to a dual variable domain light chain and a dual variable domain heavy chain which assemble primarily to the desired \"dual-specific multivalent full length binding proteins\".\n\n\nAt least 50%, at least 75% and at least 90% of the assembled, and expressed dual variable domain immunoglobulin molecules are the desired dual-specific tetravalent protein. This aspect of the invention particularly enhances the commercial utility of the invention. Therefore, the present invention includes a method to express a dual variable domain light chain and a dual variable \n\n domain heavy chain in a single cell leading to a single primary product of a \"dual-specific tetravalent full length binding protein\".\n\n\nThe present invention provides a methods of expressing a dual variable domain light chain and a dual variable domain heavy chain in a single cell leading to a \"primary product\" of a \"dual-specific tetravalent full length binding protein\", where the \"primary product\" is more than 50% of all assembled protein, comprising a dual variable domain light chain and a dual variable domain heavy chain.\n\n\nThe present invention provides methods of expressing a dual variable domain light chain and a dual variable domain heavy chain in a single cell leading to a single \"primary product\" of a \"dual-specific tetravalent full length binding protein\", where the \"primary product\" is more than 75% of all assembled protein, comprising a dual variable domain light chain and a dual variable domain heavy chain.\n\n\nThe present invention provides methods of expressing a dual variable domain light chain and a dual variable domain heavy chain in a single cell leading to a single \"primary product\" of a \"dual-specific tetravalent full length binding protein\", where the \"primary product\" is more than 90% of all assembled protein, comprising a dual variable domain light chain and a dual variable domain heavy chain.\n\n\nII. Derivatized DVD binding proteins:\n\n\nOne embodiment provides a labeled binding protein wherein the binding protein of the invention is derivatized or linked to another functional molecule (e.g., another peptide or protein). For example, a labeled binding protein of the invention can be derived by functionally linking an binding protein of the invention (by chemical coupling, genetic fusion, noncovalent association or otherwise) to one or more other molecular entities, such as another antibody (e.g., a bispecific antibody or a diabody), a detectable agent, a cytotoxic agent, a pharmaceutical agent, and/or a protein or peptide that can mediate association of the binding protein with another molecule (such as a streptavidin core region or a polyhistidine tag).\n\n\nUseful detectable agents with which a binding protein of the invention may be derivatized include fluorescent compounds. Exemplary fluorescent detectable agents include fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, 5-dimethylamine-l-napthalenesulfonyl chloride, phycoerythrin and the like. A binding protein may also be derivatized with detectable enzymes, such as alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase, glucose oxidase and the like. When a binding protein is derivatized with a detectable enzyme, it is detected by adding additional reagents that the enzyme uses to produce a detectable reaction product. For example, when the \n\n detectable agent horseradish peroxidase is present, the addition of hydrogen peroxide and diaminobenzidine leads to a colored reaction product, which is detectable, a binding protein may also be derivatized with biotin, and detected through indirect measurement of avidin or streptavidin binding.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the invention provides a crystallized binding protein and formulations and compositions comprising such crystals. In one embodiment the crystallized binding protein has a greater half-life in vivo than the soluble counterpart of the binding protein. In another embodiment the binding protein retains biological activity after crystallization.\n\n\nCrystallized binding protein of the invention may be produced according to methods known in the art and as disclosed in WO 02072636, incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the invention provides a glycosylated binding protein wherein the antibody or antigen-binding portion thereof comprises one or more carbohydrate residues. Nascent in vivo protein production may undergo further processing, known as post-translational modification. In particular, sugar (glycosyl) residues may be added enzymatically, a process known as glycosylation. The resulting proteins bearing covalently linked oligosaccharide side chains are known as glycosylated proteins or glycoproteins. Antibodies are glycoproteins with one or more carbohydrate residues in the Fc domain, as well as the variable domain. Carbohydrate residues in the Fc domain have important effect on the effector function of the Fc domain, with minimal effect on antigen binding or half-life of the antibody (R. Jefferis, Biotechnol. Prog. 21 (2005), pp. 11-16). In contrast, glycosylation of the variable domain may have an effect on the antigen binding activity of the antibody. Glycosylation in the variable domain may have a negative effect on antibody binding affinity, likely due to steric hindrance (Co, M.S., et al., MoI. Immunol. (1993) 30:1361- 1367), or result in increased affinity for the antigen (Wallick, S.C., et al., Exp. Med. (1988) 168:1099-1109; Wright, A., et al., EMBO J. (1991) 10:2717 2723).\n\n\nOne aspect of the present invention is directed to generating glycosylation site mutants in which the O- or N-linked glycosylation site of the binding protein has been mutated. One skilled in the art can generate such mutants using standard well-known technologies. Glycosylation site mutants that retain the biological activity but have increased or decreased binding activity are another object of the present invention.\n\n\nIn still another embodiment, the glycosylation of the antibody or antigen-binding portion of the invention is modified. For example, an aglycoslated antibody can be made (i.e., the antibody lacks glycosylation). Glycosylation can be altered to, for example, increase the affinity \n\n of the antibody for antigen. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further detail in PCT Publication WO2003016466A2, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,714,350 and 6,350,861, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nAdditionally or alternatively, a modified binding protein of the invention can be made that has an altered type of glycosylation, such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues (see Kanda, Yutaka et al., Journal of Biotechnology (2007), 130(3), 300-310.) or an antibody having increased bisecting GIcNAc structures. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies of the invention to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. See, for example, Shields, R. L. et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-26740; Umana et al. (1999) Nat. Biotech. 17:176-1, as well as, European Patent No: EP 1,176,195; PCT Publications WO 03/035835; WO 99/54342 80, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nProtein glycosylation depends on the amino acid sequence of the protein of interest, as well as the host cell in which the protein is expressed. Different organisms may produce different glycosylation enzymes (eg., glycosyltransferases and glycosidases), and have different substrates (nucleotide sugars) available. Due to such factors, protein glycosylation pattern, and composition of glycosyl residues, may differ depending on the host system in which the particular protein is expressed. Glycosyl residues useful in the invention may include, but are not limited to, glucose, galactose, mannose, fucose, n-acetylglucosamiiie and sialic acid. In an embodiment, the glycosylated binding protein comprises glycosyl residues such that the glycosylation pattern is human.\n\n\nIt is known to those skilled in the art that differing protein glycosylation may result in differing protein characteristics. For instance, the efficacy of a therapeutic protein produced in a microorganism host, such as yeast, and glycosylated utilizing the yeast endogenous pathway may be reduced compared to that of the same protein expressed in a mammalian cell, such as a CHO cell line. Such glycoproteins may also be immunogenic in humans and show reduced half-life in vivo after administration. Specific receptors in humans and other animals may recognize specific glycosyl residues and promote the rapid clearance of the protein from the bloodstream. Other \n\n adverse effects may include changes in protein folding, solubility, susceptibility to proteases, trafficking, transport, compartmentalization, secretion, recognition by other proteins or factors, antigenicity, or allergenicity. Accordingly, a practitioner may choose a therapeutic protein with a specific composition and pattern of glycosylation, for example glycosylation composition and pattern identical, or at least similar, to that produced in human cells or in the species-specific cells of the intended subject animal.\n\n\nExpressing glycosylated proteins different from that of a host cell may be achieved by genetically modifying the host cell to express heterologous glycosylation enzymes. Using techniques known in the art a practitioner may generate antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof exhibiting human protein glycosylation. For example, yeast strains have been genetically modified to express non-naturally occurring glycosylation enzymes such that glycosylated proteins (glycoproteins) produced in these yeast strains exhibit protein glycosylation identical to that of animal cells, especially human cells (U.S patent applications 20040018590 and 20020137134 and PCT publication WO2005100584 A2).\n\n\nIn addition to the binding proteins, the present invention is also directed to anti-idiotypic\n\n\n(anti-Id) antibodies specific for such binding proteins of the invention. An anti-Id antibody is an antibody, which recognizes unique determinants generally associated with the antigen-binding region of another antibody. The anti-Id can be prepared by immunizing an animal with the binding protein or a CDR containing region thereof. The immunized animal will recognize, and respond to the idiotypic determinants of the immunizing antibody and produce an anti-Id antibody. It is readily apparent that it may be easier to generate anti-idiotypic antibodies to the two or more parent antibodies incorporated into a DVD-Ig molecule; and confirm binding studies by methods well recognized in the art (e.g.,BIAcore, ELISA) to verify that anti-idiotypic antibodies specific for the idiotype of each parent antibody also recognize the idiotype (e.g.,antigen binding site) in the context of the DVD-Ig. The anti-idiotypic antibodies specific for each of the two or more antigen binding sites of a DVD-Ig provide ideal reagents to measure DVD-Ig concentrations of a human DVD-Ig in patrient serum; DVD-Ig concentration assays can be established using a \"sandwich assay ELISA format\" with an antibody to a first antigen binding regions coated on the solid phase (e.g.,BIAcore chip, ELISA plate etc.), rinsed with rinsing buffer, incubation with the serum sample, another rinsing step and ultimately incubation with another anti-idiotypic antibody to the another antigen binding site, itself labeled with an enzyme for quantitation of the binding reaction. In an embodiment, for a DVD-Ig with more than two different binding sites, anti-idiotypic antibodies to the two outermost binding sites (most distal and proximal from the constant region) will not only help in determining the DVD-Ig concentration in human serum but also document the integrity of the molecule in vivo. Each anti- \n\n Id antibody may also be used as an \"immunogen\" to induce an immune response in yet another animal, producing a so-called anti-anti-Id antibody.\n\n\nFurther, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that a protein of interest may be expressed using a library of host cells genetically engineered to express various glycosylation enzymes, such that member host cells of the library produce the protein of interest with variant glycosylation patterns. A practitioner may then select and isolate the protein of interest with particular novel glycosylation patterns. In an embodiment, the protein having a particularly selected novel glycosylation pattern exhibits improved or altered biological properties.\n\n\nIII. Uses of DVD-Ig\n\n\nGiven their ability to bind to two or more antigens the binding proteins of the invention can be used to detect the antigens (e.g., in a biological sample, such as serum or plasma), using a conventional immunoassay, such as an enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), an radioimmunoassay (RIA) or tissue immunohistochemistry. The DVD-Ig is directly or indirectly labeled with a detectable substance to facilitate detection of the bound or unbound antibody. Suitable detectable substances include various enzymes, prosthetic groups, fluorescent materials, luminescent materials and radioactive materials. Examples of suitable enzymes include horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, or acetylcholinesterase; examples of suitable prosthetic group complexes include streptavidin/biotin and avidin/biotin; examples of suitable fluorescent materials include umbelliferone, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, dichlorotriazinylamine fluorescein, dansyl chloride or phycoerythrin; an example of a luminescent material includes luminol; and examples of suitable radioactive material include \n3\nH\n1\n \n14\nC \n35\nS, \n9\nV, \n99\nTc, \n111\nIn, \n125\n1, \n131\n1, \n177\nLu, \n166\nHo, or \n153\nSm.\n\n\nIn an embodiment, the binding proteins of the invention are capable of neutralizing the activity of the antigens both in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, such DVD-Igs can be used to inhibit antigen activity, e.g., in a cell culture containing the antigens, in human subjects or in other mammalian subjects having the antigens with which a binding protein of the invention cross- reacts. In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for reducing antigen activity in a subject suffering from a disease or disorder in which the antigen activity is detrimental. A binding protein of the invention can be administered to a human subject for therapeutic purposes.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"a disorder in which antigen activity is detrimental\" is intended to include diseases and other disorders in which the presence of the antigen in a subject suffering from the disorder has been shown to be or is suspected of being either responsible for the pathophysiology of the disorder or a factor that contributes to a worsening of the disorder. \n\n Accordingly, a disorder in which antigen activity is detrimental is a disorder in which reduction of antigen activity is expected to alleviate the symptoms and/or progression of the disorder. Such disorders may be evidenced, for example, by an increase in the concentration of the antigen in a biological fluid of a subject suffering from the disorder (e.g., an increase in the concentration of antigen in serum, plasma, synovial fluid, etc. of the subject). Non-limiting examples of disorders that can be treated with the binding proteins of the invention include those disorders discussed below and in the section pertaining to pharmaceutical compositions of the antibodies of the invention.\n\n\nThe DVD-Igs of the invention may bind one antigen or multiple antigens. Such antigens include, but are not limited to, the targets listed in the following databases, which databases are incorporated herein by reference. These target databases include those listings:\n\n\nTherapeutic targets (http://xin.cz3.nus.edu.sg/group/cjttd/ttd.asp);\n\n\nCytokines and cytokine receptors (http://www.cytokinewebfacts.com/, http://www.copewithcytokines.de/cope.cgi, and\n\n\nhttp://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/cmbidata/cgf/CGF_Database/cytokine.medic.kumamoto- u.ac.jp/CFC/indexR.html);\n\n\nChemokines (http://cytokine.medic.kumamoto-u.ac.jp/CFC/CK/Chemokine.html);\n\n\nChemokine receptors and GPCRs (http://csp.medic.kumamoto-u.ac.jp/CSP/Receptor.html, http://www.gpcr.org/7tm/);\n\n\nOlfactory Receptors (http://senselab.med.yale.edu/senselab/ORDB/default.asp);\n\n\nReceptors (http ://www.iuphar-db.org/iuphar-rd/list/index.htm);\n\n\nCancer targets (http://cged.hgc.jp/cgi-bin/input.cgi);\n\n\nSecreted proteins as potential antibody targets (http://spd.cbi.pku.edu.cn/);\n\n\nProtein kinases (http://spd.cbi.pku.edu.cn/), and\n\n\nHuman CD markers (http://content.labvelocity.eom/tools/6/l 226/CD_table_final_locked.pdf) and (Zola H, 2005 CD molecules 2005: human cell differentiation molecules Blood, 106:3123-6).\n\n\nDVD-Igs are useful as therapeutic agents to simultaneously block two different targets to enhance efficacy/safety and/or increase patient coverage. Such targets may include soluble \n\n targets (TNF) and cell surface receptor targets (VEGFR and EGFR). It can also be used to induce redirected cytotoxicity between tumor cells and T cells (Her2 and CD3) for cancer therapy, or between autoreactive cell and effector cells for autoimmune disease or transplantation, or between any target cell and effector cell to eliminate disease-causing cells in any given disease.\n\n\nIn addition, DVD-Ig can be used to trigger receptor clustering and activation when it is designed to target two different epitopes on the same receptor. This may have benefit in making agonistic and antagonistic anti-GPCR therapeutics. In this case, DVD-Ig can be used to target two different epitopes (including epitopes on both the loop regions and the extracellular domain) on one cell for clustering/signaling (two cell surface molecules) or signaling (on one molecule). Similarly, a DVD-Ig molecule can be designed to triger CTLA-4 ligation, and a negative signal by targeting two different epitopes (or 2 copies of the same epitope) of CTLA-4 extracellular domain, leading to down regulation of the immune response. CTLA-4 is a clinically validated target for therapeutic treatment of a number of immunological disorders. CTLA-4/B7 interactions negatively regulate T cell activation by attenuating cell cycle progression, IL-2 production, and proliferation of T cells following activation, and CTLA-4 (CD152) engagement can down- regulate T cell activation and promote the induction of immune tolerance. However, the strategy of attenuating T cell activation by agonistic antibody engagement of CTLA-4 has been unsuccessful since CTLA-4 activation requires ligation. The molecular interaction of CTLA-4/B7 is in \"skewed zipper\" arrays, as demonstrated by crystal structural analysis (Stamper 2001 Nature 410:608). However none of the currently available CTLA-4 binding reagents have ligation properties, including anti-CTLA-4 mAbs. There have been several attempts to address this issue. In one case, a cell member-bound single chain antibody was generated, and significantly inhibited allogeneic rejection in mice (Hwang 2002 JI 169:633). In a separate case, artificial APC surface- linked single-chain antibody to CTLA-4 was generated and demonstrated to attenuate T cell responses (Griffin 2000 JI 164:4433). In both cases, CTLA-4 ligation was achieved by closely localized member-bound antibodies in artificial systems. While these experiments provide proof- of-concept for immune down-regulation by triggering CTLA-4 negative signaling, the reagents used in these reports are not suitable for therapeutic use. To this end, CTLA-4 ligation may be achieved by using a DVD-Ig molecule, which target two different epitopes (or 2 copies of the same epitope) of CTLA-4 extracellular domain. The rationale is that the distance spanning two binding sites of an IgG, approximately 150-170A, is too large for active ligation of CTLA-4 (30- 50 A between 2 CTLA-4 homodimer). However the distance between the two binding sites on DVD-Ig (one arm) is much shorter, also in the range of 30-50 A, allowing proper ligation of CTLA-4. \n\n Similarly, DVD-Ig can target two different members of a cell surface receptor complex (e.g.,IL-12R alpha and beta). Furthermore, DVD-Ig can target CRl and a soluble protein/pathogen to drive rapid clearance of the target soluble protein/pathogen.\n\n\nAdditionally, DVD-Igs of the invention can be employed for tissue-specific delivery (target a tissue marker and a disease mediator for enhanced local PK thus higher efficacy and/or lower toxicity), including intracellular delivery (targeting an internalizing receptor and a intracellular molecule), delivering to inside brain (targeting transferrin receptor and a CNS disease mediator for crossing the blood-brain barrier). DVD-Ig can also serve as a carrier protein to deliver an antigen to a specific location via binding to a non-neutralizing epitope of that antigen and also to increase the half-life of the antigen. Furthermore, DVD-Ig can be designed to either be physically linked to medical devices implanted into patients or target these medical devices (see Burke, Sandra E.; Kuntz, Richard E.; Schwartz, Lewis B., Zotarolimus eluting stents. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews (2006), 58(3), 437-446; Surface coatings for biological activation and functionalization of medical devices, Hildebrand, H. F.; Blanchemain, N.; Mayer, G.; Chai, F.; Lefebvre, M.; Boschin, F., Surface and Coatings Technology (2006), 200(22-23), 6318-6324; Drug/ device combinations for local drug therapies and infection prophylaxis, Wu, Peng; Grainger, David W., Biomaterials (2006), 27(11), 2450-2467; Mediation of the cytokine network in the implantation of orthopedic devices., Marques, A. P.; Hunt, J. A.; Reis, Rui L., Biodegradable Systems in Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine (2005), 377-397). Briefly, directing appropriate types of cell to the site of medical implant may promote healing and restoring normal tissue function. Alternatively, inhibition of mediators (including but not limited to cytokines), released upon device implantation by a DVD coupled to or target to a device is also provided. For example, Stents have been used for years in interventional cardiology to clear blocked arteries and to improve the flow of blood to the heart muscle. However, traditional bare metal stents have been known to cause restenosis (re-narrowing of the artery in a treated area) in some patients and can lead to blood clots. Recently, an anti-CD34 antibody coated stent has been described which reduced restenosis and prevents blood clots from occurring by capturing endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) circulating throughout the blood. Endothelial cells are cells that line blood vessels, allowing blood to flow smoothly. The EPCs adhere to the hard surface of the stent forming a smooth layer that not only promotes healing but prevents restenosis and blood clots, complications previously associated with the use of stents (Aoji et al. 2005 J Am Coll Cardiol. 45(10): 1574-9). In addition to improving outcomes for patients requiring stents, there are also implications for patients requiring cardiovascular bypass surgery. For example, a prosthetic vascular conduit (artificial artery) coated with anti-EPC antibodies would eliminate the need to use arteries from patients legs or arms for bypass surgery grafts. This would reduce surgery and anesthesia times, which in turn will reduce coronary surgery deaths. DVD-Ig are \n\n designed in such a way that it binds to a cell surface marker (such as CD34) as well as a protein (or an epitope of any kind, including but not limited to proteins, lipids and polysaccharides) that has been coated on the implanted device to facilitate the cell recruitment. Such approaches can also be applied to other medical implants in general. Alternatively, DVD-Igs can be coated on medical devices and upon implantation and releasing all DVDs from the device (or any other need which may require additional fresh DVD-Ig, including aging and denaturation of the already loaded DVD-Ig) the device could be reloaded by systemic administration of fresh DVD-Ig to the patient, where the DVD-Ig is designed to binds to a target of interest (a cytokine, a cell surface marker (such as CD34) etc.) with one set of binding sites and to a target coated on the device (including a protein, an epitope of any kind, including but not limited to lipids, polysaccharides and polymers ) with the other. This technology has the advantage of extending the usefulness of coated implants.\n\n\nA. Use of DVD-Igs in various diseases\n\n\nDVD-Ig molecules of the invention are also useful as therapeutic molecules to treat various diseases. Such DVD molecules may bind one or more targets involved in a specific disease. Examples of such targets in various diseases are described below.\n\n\n1. Human Autoimmune and Inflammatory Response\n\n\nMany proteins have been implicated in general autoimmune and inflammatory responses, including C5, CCLl (1-309), CCLl 1 (eotaxin), CCL 13 (mcp-4), CCL 15 (MIP-Id), CCL 16 (HCC- 4), CCL17 (TARC), CCL18 (PARC), CCL19, CCL2 (mcp-1), CCL20 (MIP-3a), CCL21 (MIP-2), CCL23 (MPIF-I), CCL24 (MPIF-2 / eotaxin-2), CCL25 (TECK), CCL26, CCL3 (MIP-Ia), CCL4 (MIP-Ib), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL7 (mcp-3), CCL8 (mcp-2), CXCLl, CXCLlO (IP-IO), CXCLl 1 (I-TAC / IP-9), CXCL12 (SDFl), CXCL13, CXCL14, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5 (ENA-78 / LIX), CXCL6 (GCP-2), CXCL9, IL13, IL8, CCL13 (mcp-4), CCRl, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, CX3CR1, IL8RA, XCRl (CCXCRl), IFNA2, ILlO, IL13, IL17C, ILIA, ILlB, ILlFlO, IL1F5, IL1F6, IL1F7, IL1F8, IL1F9, IL22, IL5, IL8, IL9, LTA, LTB, MIF, SCYEl (endothelial Monocyte-activating cytokine), SPPl, TNF, TNFSF5, IFNA2, ILlORA, ILlORB, IL13, IL13RA1, IL5RA, IL9, IL9R, ABCFl, BCL6, C3, C4A, CEBPB, CRP, ICEBERG, ILlRl, ILlRN, IL8RB, LTB4R, TOLLIP, FADD, IRAKI, IRAK2, MYD88, NCK2, TNFAIP3, TRADD, TRAFl, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF4, TRAF5, TRAF6,\n\n\nACVRl, ACVRlB, ACVR2, ACVR2B, ACVRLl, CD28, CD3E, CD3G, CD3Z, CD69, CD80, CD86, CNRl, CTLA4, CYSLTRl, FCERlA, FCER2, FCGR3A, GPR44, HAVCR2, OPRDl, P2RX7, TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, TLR9, TLRlO, BLRl, CCLl, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CCLl 1, CCL13, CCL15, CCL16, CCL17, CCL18, CCL19, \n\n CCL20, CCL21, CCL22, CCL23, CCL24, CCL25, CCRl, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CCR9, CX3CL1, CX3CR1, CXCLl, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCLlO, CXCLl 1, CXCL12, CXCL13, CXCR4, GPR2, SCYEl, SDF2, XCLl, XCL2, XCRl, AMH, AMHR2, BMPRlA, BMPRlB, BMPR2, C19orflO (IL27w), CERl, CSFl, CSF2, CSF3, DKFZp451J0118, FGF2, GFIl, IFNAl, IFNBl, IFNG, IGFl, ILIA, ILlB, ILlRl, IL1R2, IL2, IL2RA, IL2RB, IL2RG, IL3, IL4, IL4R, IL5, IL5RA, IL6, IL6R, IL6ST, IL7, IL8, IL8RA, IL8RB, IL9, IL9R, ILlO, ILlORA, ILlORB, ILI l, ILI lRA, IL12A, IL12B, IL12RB1, IL12RB2, IL13, IL13RA1, IL13RA2, IL15, IL15RA, IL16, IL17, IL17R, IL18, IL18R1, IL19, IL20, KITLG, LEP, LTA, LTB, LTB4R, LTB4R2, LTBR, MIF, NPPB, PDGFB, TBX21, TDGFl, TGFA, TGFBl, TGFBlIl, TGFB2, TGFB3, TGFBI, TGFBRl, TGFBR2, TGFBR3, THlL, TNF, TNFRSFlA, TNFRSFlB, TNFRSF7, TNFRSF8, TNFRSF9, TNFRSFl IA, TNFRSF21, TNFSF4, TNFSF5, TNFSF6, TNFSFl 1, VEGF, ZFPM2, and RNFl 10 (ZNF144). In one aspect, DVD-Igs capable of binding one or more of the targets listed herein are provided.\n\n\n2. Asthma\n\n\nAllergic asthma is characterized by the presence of eosinophilia, goblet cell metaplasia, epithelial cell alterations, airway hyperreactivity (AHR), and Th2 and ThI cytokine expression, as well as elevated serum IgE levels. It is now widely accepted that airway inflammation is the key factor underlying the pathogenesis of asthma, involving a complex interplay of inflammatory cells such as T cells, B cells, eosinophils, mast cells and macrophages, and of their secreted mediators including cytokines and chemokines. Corticosteroids are the most important anti-inflammatory treatment for asthma today, however their mechanism of action is non-specific and safety concerns exist, especially in the juvenile patient population. The development of more specific and targeted therapies is therefore warranted. There is increasing evidence that IL-13 in mice mimics many of the features of asthma, including AHR, mucus hypersecretion and airway fibrosis, independently of eosinophilic inflammation (Finotto et al., International Immunology (2005), 17(8), 993-1007; Padilla et al., Journal of Immunology (2005), 174(12), 8097-8105).\n\n\nIL- 13 has been implicated as having a pivotal role in causing pathological responses associated with asthma. The development of anti-IL-13 mAb therapy to reduce the effects of IL- 13 in the lung is an exciting new approach that offers considerable promise as a novel treatment for asthma. However other mediators of differential immunological pathways are also involved in asthma pathogenesis, and blocking these mediators, in addition to IL- 13, may offer additional therapeutic benefit. Such target pairs include, but are not limited to, IL-13 and a pro- inflammatory cytokine, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). TNF-α may amplify the inflammatory response in asthma and may be linked to disease severity (McDonnell, et al., \n\n Progress in Respiratory Research (2001), 31 (New Drugs for Asthma, Allergy and COPD), 247- 250.). This suggests that blocking both IL-13 and TNF-α may have beneficial effects, particularly in severe airway disease. In another embodiment the DVD-Ig of the invention binds the targets IL-13 and TNFα and is used for treating asthma.\n\n\nAnimal models such as OVA-induced asthma mouse model, where both inflammation and AHR can be assessed, are known in the art and may be used to determine the ability of various DVD-Ig molecules to treat asthma. Animal models for studying asthma are disclosed in Coffman, et al., Journal of Experimental Medicine (2005), 201(12), 1875-1879; Lloyd, et al., Advances in Immunology (2001), 77, 263-295; Boyce et al., Journal of Experimental Medicine (2005), 201(12), 1869-1873; and Snibson, et al., Journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2005), 35(2), 146-52. In addition to routine safety assessments of these target pairs specific tests for the degree of immunosuppression may be warranted and helpful in selecting the best target pairs (see Luster et al., Toxicology (1994), 92(1-3), 229-43; Descotes, et al., Developments in biological standardization (1992), 77 99-102; Hart et al., Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2001), 108(2), 250-257).\n\n\nBased on the rationale disclosed herein and using the same evaluation model for efficacy and safety other pairs of targets that DVD-Ig molecules can bind and be useful to treat asthma may be determined. In an embodiment, such targets include, but are not limited to, IL-13 and IL- lbeta, since IL-lbeta is also implicated in inflammatory response in asthma; IL-13 and cytokines and chemokines that are involved in inflammation, such as IL-13 and IL-9; IL-13 and IL-4; IL-13 and IL-5; IL-13 and IL-25; IL-13 and TARC; IL-13 and MDC; IL-13 and MIF; IL-13 and TGF-β; IL-13 and LHR agonist; IL-13 and CL25; IL-13 and SPRR2a; IL-13 and SPRR2b; and IL-13 and ADAM8. The present invention also provides DVD-Igs capable of binding one or more targets involved in asthma selected from the group consisting of CSFl (MCSF), CSF2 (GM-CSF), CSF3 (GCSF), FGF2, IFNAl, IFNBl, IFNG, histamine and histamine receptors, ILIA, ILlB, IL2, IL3, IL4, IL5, IL6, IL7, IL8, IL9, ILlO, ILl 1, IL12A, IL12B, IL13, IL14, IL15, IL16, IL17, ILl 8, IL19, KITLG, PDGFB, IL2RA, IL4R, IL5RA, IL8RA, IL8RB, IL12RB1, IL12RB2, IL13RA1, IL13RA2, IL18R1, TSLP, CCLl, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL7, CCL8, CCL13, CCL17, CCL18, CCL19, CCL20, CCL22, CCL24,CX3CL1, CXCLl, CXCL2, CXCL3, XCLl, CCR2, CCR3, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, CCR7, CCR8, CX3CR1, GPR2, XCRl, FOS, GATA3, JAKl, JAK3, STAT6, TBX21, TGFBl, TNF, TNFSF6, YYl, CYSLTRl, FCERlA, FCER2, LTB4R, TB4R2, LTBR, and Chitinase. \n\n 3. Rheumatoid arthritis\n\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA), a systemic disease, is characterized by a chronic inflammatory reaction in the synovium of joints and is associated with degeneration of cartilage and erosion of juxta-articular bone. Many pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF, chemokines, and growth factors are expressed in diseased joints. Systemic administration of anti-TNF antibody or sTNFR fusion protein to mouse models of RA was shown to be anti-inflammatory and joint protective. Clinical investigations in which the activcity of TNF in RA patients was blocked with intravenously administered infliximab (Harriman G, Harper LK, Schaible TF. 1999 Summary of clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis using infliximab, an anti-TNFalpha treatment. Ann Rheum Dis 58 Suppl 1 :161-4), a chimeric anti-TNF mAb, has provided evidence that TNF regulates IL-6, IL-8, MCP-I, and VEGF production, recruitment of immune and inflammatory cells into joints, angiogenesis, and reduction of blood levels of matrix metalloproteinases-1 and -3. A better understanding of the inflammatory pathway in rheumatoid arthritis has led to identification of other therapeutic targets involved in rheumatoid arthritis. Promising treatments such as interleukin-6 antagonists (IL-6 receptor antibody MRA, developed by Chugai, Roche (see Nishimoto, Norihiro et al., Arthritis & Rheumatism (2004), 50(6), 1761-1769), CTLA4Ig (abatacept, Genovese Mc et al 2005 Abatacept for rheumatoid arthritis refractory to tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibition. N Engl J Med. 353:1114-23.), and anti-B cell therapy (rituximab, Okamoto H, Kamatani N. 2004 Rituximab for rheumatoid arthritis. N Engl J Med. 351 :1909) have already been tested in randomized controlled trials over the past year. Other cytokines have been identified and have been shown to be of benefit in animal models, including interleukin-15 (therapeutic antibody HuMax-IL_15, AMG 714 see Baslund, Bo et al., Arthritis & Rheumatism (2005), 52(9), 2686-2692), interleukin-17, and interleukin-18, and clinical trials of these agents are currently under way. Dual-specific antibody therapy, combining anti-TNF and another mediator, has great potential in enhancing clinical efficacy and/or patient coverage. For example, blocking both TNF and VEGF can potentially eradicate inflammation and angiogenesis, both of which are involved in pathophysiology of RA. Blocking other pairs of targets involved in RA including, but not limited to, TNF and IL-18; TNF and IL-12; TNF and IL-23; TNF and IL-lbeta; TNF and MIF; TNF and IL-17; and TNF and IL-15 with specific DVD Igs is also contemplated. In addition to routine safety assessments of these target pairs, specific tests for the degree of immunosuppression may be warranted and helpful in selecting the best target pairs (see Luster et al., Toxicology (1994), 92(1-3), 229-43; Descotes, et al., Developments in biological standardization (1992), 77 99-102; Hart et al., Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2001), 108(2), 250-257). Whether a DVD Ig molecule will be useful for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis can be assessed using pre-clinical animal RA models such as the collagen- induced arthritis mouse model. Other useful models are also well known in the art (see Brand \n\n DD., Comp Med. (2005) 55(2): 114-22). Based on the cross-reactivity of the parental antibodies for human and mouse othologues (e.g.,reactivity for human and mouse TNF, human and mouse IL- 15 etc.) validation studies in the mouse CIA model may be conducted with \"matched surrogate antibody\" derived DVD-Ig molecules; briefly, a DVD-Ig based on two (or more) mouse target specific antibodies may be matched to the extent possible to the characteristics of the parental human or humanized antibodies used for human DVD-Ig construction (similar affinity, similar neutralization potency, similar half-life etc.).\n\n\n4. SLE\n\n\nThe immunopathogenic hallmark of SLE is the polyclonal B cell activation, which leads to hyperglobulinemia, autoantibody production and immune complex formation. The fundamental abnormality appears to be the failure of T cells to suppress the forbidden B cell clones due to generalized T cell dysregulation. In addition, B and T-cell interaction is facilitated by several cytokines such as IL-IO as well as co-stimulatory molecules such as CD40 and CD40L, B7 and CD28 and CTLA-4, which initiate the second signal. These interactions together with impaired phagocytic clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic material, perpetuate the immune response with resultant tissue injury. The following targets may be involved in SLE and can potentially be used for DVD-Ig approach for therapeutic intervention: B cell targeted therapies: CD-20, CD-22, CD- 19, CD28, CD4, CD80, HLA-DRA, ILlO, IL2, IL4, TNFRSF5, TNFRSF6, TNFSF5, TNFSF6, BLRl, HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7A, HDAC9, ICOSL, IGBPl, MS4A1, RGSl, SLA2, CD81, IFNBl, ILlO, TNFRSF5, TNFRSF7, TNFSF5, AICDA, BLNK,\n\n\nGALNAC4S-6ST, HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7A, HDAC9, ILlO, ILl 1, IL4, INHA, INHBA, KLF6, TNFRSF7, CD28, CD38, CD69, CD80, CD83, CD86, DPP4, FCER2, IL2RA, TNFRSF8, TNFSF7, CD24, CD37, CD40, CD72, CD74, CD79A, CD79B, CR2, IL1R2, ITGA2, ITGA3, MS4A1, ST6GAL1, CDlC, CHSTlO, HLA-A, HLA-DRA, and NT5E.; co-stimulatory signals: CTLA4 or B7.1/B7.2; inhibition of B cell survival: BIyS, BAFF; Complement inactivation: C5; Cytokine modulation: the key principle is that the net biologic response in any tissue is the result of a balance between local levels of proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines (see Sfikakis PP et al 2005 Curr Opin Rheumatol 17:550-7). SLE is considered to be a Th-2 driven disease with documented elevations in serum IL-4, IL-6, IL-10. DVD Igs capable of binding one or more targets selected from the group consisting of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-α, and TNF-α are also contemplated. Combination of targets discussed herein will enhance therapeutic efficacy for SLE which can be tested in a number of lupus preclinical models (see Peng SL (2004) Methods MoI Med.; 102:227-72). Based on the cross-reactivity of the parental antibodies for human and mouse othologues (e.g.,reactivity for human and mouse CD20, human and mouse Interferon alpha etc.) validation studies in a mouse lupus model may be conducted with \"matched surrogate antibody\" \n\n derived DVD-Ig molecules; briefly, a DVD-Ig based two (or more) mouse target specific antibodies may be matched to the extent possible to the characteristics of the parental human or humanized antibodies used for human DVD-Ig construction (similar affinity, similar neutralization potency, similar half-life etc.).\n\n\n5. Multiple sclerosis\n\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex human autoimmune-type disease with a predominantly unknown etiology. Immunologic destruction of myelin basic protein (MBP) throughout the nervous system is the major pathology of multiple sclerosis. MS is a disease of complex pathologies, which involves infiltration by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and of response within the central nervous system. Expression in the CNS of cytokines, reactive nitrogen species and costimulator molecules have all been described in MS. Of major consideration are immunological mechanisms that contribute to the development of autoimmunity. In particular, antigen expression, cytokine and leukocyte interactions, and regulatory T-cells, which help balance/modulate other T-cells such as ThI and Th2 cells, are important areas for therapeutic target identification.\n\n\nIL- 12 is a proinflammatory cytokine that is produced by APC and promotes differentiation of ThI effector cells. IL-12 is produced in the developing lesions of patients with MS as well as in EAE-affected animals. Previously it was shown that interference in IL-12 pathways effectively prevents EAE in rodents, and that in vivo neutralization of IL-12p40 using a anti-IL-12 mAb has beneficial effects in the myelin-induced EAE model in common marmosets.\n\n\nTWEAK is a member of the TNF family, constitutively expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), with pro-inflammatory, proliferative or apoptotic effects depending upon cell types. Its receptor, Fnl4, is expressed in CNS by endothelial cells, reactive astrocytes and neurons. TWEAK and Fnl4 mRNA expression increased in spinal cord during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Anti-TWEAK antibody treatment in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) induced EAE in C57BL/6 mice resulted in a reduction of disease severity and leukocyte infiltration when mice were treated after the priming phase.\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention pertains to DVD Ig molecules capable of binding one or more, for example two, targets selected from the group consisting of IL-12, TWEAK, IL-23, CXCLl 3, CD40, CD40L, IL-18, VEGF, VLA-4, TNF, CD45RB, CD200, IFNgamma, GM-CSF, FGF, C5, CD52, and CCR2. An embodiment includes a dual-specific anti-IL-12/TWEAK DVD Ig as a therapeutic agent beneficial for the treatment of MS. \n\n Several animal models for assessing the usefulness of the DVD molecules to treat MS are known in the art (see Steinman L, et al., (2005) Trends Immunol. 26(11):565-71; Lublin FD., et al., (1985) Springer Semin Immunopathol.8(3): 197-208; Genain CP, et al., (1997) J MoI Med. 75(3): 187-97; Tuohy VK, et al., (1999) J Exp Med. 189(7): 1033-42; Owens T, et al., (1995) Neurol Clin.l3(l):51-73; and 't Hart BA, et al., (2005) J Immunol 175(7):4761-8. Based on the cross-reactivity of the parental antibodies for human and animal species othologues (e.g.,reactivity for human and mouse IL-12, human and mouse TWEAK etc.) validation studies in the mouse EAE model may be conducted with \"matched surrogate antibody\" derived DVD-Ig molecules; briefly, a DVD-Ig based on to (or more) mouse target specific antibodies may be matched to the extent possible to the characteristics of the parental human or humanized antibodies used for human DVD-Ig construction (similar affinity, similar neutralization potency, similar half-life etc.). The same concept applies to animal models in other non-rodent species, where a \"matched surrogate antibody\" derived DVD-Ig would be selected for the anticipated pharmacology and possibly safety studies. In addition to routine safety assessments of these target pairs specific tests for the degree of immunosuppression may be warranted and helpful in selecting the best target pairs (see Luster et al., Toxicology (1994), 92(1-3), 229-43; Descotes, et al., Developments in biological standardization (1992), 77 99-102; Jones R. 2000 Rovelizumab (ICOS Corp). IDrugs.3(4):442-6).\n\n\nMS is however not only an imunologic disease but has a very important neurodegenerative component. Disease progression in MS is due to cumulative loss and damage of axons and the final disease scores of the patients are determined by these neurodegenerative processes (Compston A. & Coles A. (2008) Lancet 372: 1502 - 1517; Trapp BD. & Nave KA. (2008) Annu.Rev. Neuroscience 31 : 247 - 269). Several mechanisms might account for axonal damage in MS. Excessive release of the neurotransmitter glutamate with associated calcium- mediated neurotoxicity, nitric-oxide release and subsequent axon damage, loss of neurotrophic support, massive accumulation of repulsive or axon growth inhibitory molecules like RGM A, NOGO A, Semaphorins, Ephrins, may contribute to axon-directed neurodegeneration and loss of successful axon regeneration. Targeting in a single DVD Ig molecule neutralizing activities directed against components like RGM A, NOGO A, Semaphorins, Ephrins with neutralizing activities directed against pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-12, TWEAK, IL-23, CXCL13,\n\n\nCD40, CD40L, IL-18, VEGF, VLA-4, TNF, CD45RB, CD200, IFNgamma, GM-CSF, FGF, C5, CD52, and CCR2 would enable the simultaneous focus on inflammation and neuroregeneration, a goal not yet achieved by any of the current therapeutic MS principles. Stimulating neuroregeneration can compensate the functional impairments caused by the massive axonal neurodegeneration observed in MS, making recovery of lost cerebral functions possible. \n\n 6. Sepsis\n\n\nThe pathophysiology of sepsis is initiated by the outer membrane components of both gram-negative organisms (lipopolysaccharide [LPS], lipid A, endotoxin) and gram-positive organisms (lipoteichoic acid, peptidoglycan). These outer membrane components are able to bind to the CD14 receptor on the surface of monocytes. By virtue of the recently described toll-like receptors, a signal is then transmitted to the cell, leading to the eventual production of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF -alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-I). Overwhelming inflammatory and immune responses are essential features of septic shock and play a central part in the pathogenesis of tissue damage, multiple organ failure, and death induced by sepsis. Cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL-I), have been shown to be critical mediators of septic shock. These cytokines have a direct toxic effect on tissues; they also activate phospholipase A2. These and other effects lead to increased concentrations of platelet-activating factor, promotion of nitric oxide synthase activity, promotion of tissue infiltration by neutrophils, and promotion of neutrophil activity.\n\n\nThe treatment of sepsis and septic shock remains a clinical conundrum, and recent prospective trials with biological response modifiers (i.e. anti-TNF, anti-MIF) aimed at the inflammatory response have shown only modest clinical benefit. Recently, interest has shifted toward therapies aimed at reversing the accompanying periods of immune suppression. Studies in experimental animals and critically ill patients have demonstrated that increased apoptosis of lymphoid organs and some parenchymal tissues contribute to this immune suppression, anergy, and organ system dysfunction. During sepsis syndromes, lymphocyte apoptosis can be triggered by the absence of IL-2 or by the release of glucocorticoids, granzymes, or the so-called 'death' cytokines: tumor necrosis factor alpha or Fas ligand. Apoptosis proceeds via auto -activation of cytosolic and/or mitochondrial caspases, which can be influenced by the pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. In experimental animals, not only can treatment with inhibitors of apoptosis prevent lymphoid cell apoptosis; it may also improve outcome. Although clinical trials with anti-apoptotic agents remain distant due in large part to technical difficulties associated with their administration and tissue targeting, inhibition of lymphocyte apoptosis represents an attractive therapeutic target for the septic patient. Likewise, a dual-specific agent targeting both inflammatory mediator and a apoptotic mediator, may have added benefit. One aspect of the invention pertains to DVD Igs capable of binding one or more targets involved in sepsis, in an embodiment two targets, selected from the group consisting TNF, IL-I , MIF, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, IL-12, IL-23, FasL, LPS, Toll-like receptors, TLR-4, tissue factor, MIP-2, ADORA2A, CASPl, CASP4, IL-IO, IL-IB\n5\n NFKBl, PROC, TNFRSFlA, CSF3, CCR3, ILlRN, MIF\n5\n NFKBl, PTAFR, TLR2, TLR4, GPR44, HMOXl, midkine, IRAKI, NFKB2, SERPINAl, SERPINEl, \n\n and TREMl . The efficacy of such DVD Igs for sepsis can be assessed in preclinical animal models known in the art (see Buras JA, et al.,(2005) Nat Rev Drug Discov. 4(10):854-65 and Calandra T, et al., (2000) Nat Med. 6(2): 164-70).\n\n\n7. Neurological disorders\n\n\n7.1. Neurodegenerative Diseases\n\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases are either chronic in which case they are usually age- dependent or acute (e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, etc.). They are characterized by progressive loss of neuronal functions (neuronal cell death, axon loss, neuritic dystrophy, demyelination), loss of mobility and loss of memory. Emerging knowledge of the mechanisms underlying chronic neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease disease) show a complex etiology and a variety of factors have been recognized to contribute to their development and progression e.g.,age, glycemic status, amyloid production and multimerization, accumulation of advanced glycation-end products (AGE) which bind to their receptor RAGE (receptor for AGE), increased brain oxidative stress, decreased cerebral blood flow, neuroinflammation including release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, neuronal dysfunction and microglial activation. Thus these chronic neurodegenerative diseases represent a complex interaction between multiple cell types and mediators. Treatment strategies for such diseases are limited and mostly constitute either blocking inflammatory processes with nonspecific anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., corticosteroids, COX inhibitors) or agents to prevent neuron loss and/or synaptic functions. These treatments fail to stop disease progression. Recent studies suggest that more targeted therapies such as antibodies to soluble A-b peptide (including the A-b oligomeric forms) can not only help stop disease progression but may help maintain memory and other cognitive functions as well. These preliminary observations suggest that specific therapies targeting more than one disease mediator (e.g.,A-b and a pro-inflammatory cytokine such as TNF) may provide even better therapeutic efficacy for chronic neurodegenerative diseases than observed with targeting a single disease mechanism (e.g.,soluble A-b alone) (see CE. Shepherd, et al, Neurobiol Aging. 2005 Oct 24; Nelson RB., Curr Pharm Des. 2005;l 1 :3335; William L. Klein.; Neurochem Int. 2002 ;41 :345; Michelle C Janelsins, et al., J Neuroinflammation. 2005 ;2:23; Soloman B., Curr Alzheimer Res. 2004; 1 : 149; Igor Klyubin, et al., Nat Med. 2005;l 1 :556-61 ; Arancio O, et al., EMBO Journal (2004) 1-10; Bornemann KD, et al., Am J Pathol. 2001 ;158:63; Deane R, et al., Nat Med. 2003;9:907-13; and Eliezer Masliah, et al., Neuron. 2005;46:857).\n\n\nThe DVD-Ig molecules of the invention can bind one or more targets involved in Chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers. Such targets include, but are not limited to, any \n\n mediator, soluble or cell surface, implicated in AD pathogenesis e.g AGE (SlOO A, amphoterin), pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-I), chemokines (e.g., MCP 1), molecules that inhibit nerve regeneration (e.g., Nogo, RGM A), molecules that enhance neurite growth (neurotrophins) and molecules that can mediate transport at the blood brain barrier (e.g., transferrin receptor, insulin receptor or RAGE). The efficacy of DVD-Ig molecules can be validated in pre-clinical animal models such as the transgenic mice that over-express amyloid precursor protein or RAGE and develop Alzheimer's disease-like symptoms. In addition, DVD-Ig molecules can be constructed and tested for efficacy in the animal models and the best therapeutic DVD-Ig can be selected for testing in human patients. DVD-Ig molecules can also be employed for treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Alpha-Synuclein is involved in Parkinson's pathology. A DVD-Ig capable of targeting alpha-synuclein and inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-I, MCP-I can prove effective therapy for Parkinson's disease and are contemplated in the invention.\n\n\nAlternatively a DVD-Ig capable of targeting alpha-synuclein and RGM A could not only halt the pathologic progress in the substantia nigra of Parkinson disease patients but could also result in regenerative growth of damaged neurites because RGM A has been recently shown to be strongly upregulated in this area in PD patients (Bossers K. et al. (2009) Brain Pathol. 19: 91 - 107).\n\n\n7.2 Neuronal Regeneration and Spinal Cord Injury\n\n\nDespite an increase in knowledge of the pathologic mechanisms, spinal cord injury (SCI) is still a devastating condition and represents a medical indication characterized by a high medical need. Most spinal cord injuries are contusion or compression injuries and the primary injury is usually followed by secondary injury mechanisms (inflammatory mediators e.g., cytokines and chemokines) that worsen the initial injury and result in significant enlargement of the lesion area, sometimes more than 10-fold. These primary and secondary mechanisms in SCI are very similar to those in brain injury caused by other means, e.g., trauma and stroke. No satisfying treatment exists and high dose bolus injection of methylprednisolone (MP) is the only used therapy within a narrow time window of 8 h post injury. This treatment, however, is only intended to prevent secondary injury without causing any significant functional recovery. It is heavily critisized for the lack of unequivocal efficacy and severe adverse effects, like immunosuppression with subsequent infections and severe histopathological muscle alterations. No other drugs, biologies or small molecules, stimulating the endogenous regenerative potential are approved, but promising treatment principles and drug candidates have shown efficacy in animal models of SCI in recent years and first promising clinical data have been presented just recently. To a large \n\n extent the lack of functional recovery in human SCI is caused by factors inhibiting neurite growth, at lesion sites, in scar tissue, in myelin as well as on injury-associated cells. Such factors are the myelin-associated proteins NogoA, OMgp and MAG, RGM A, the scar-associated CSPG (Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans) and inhibitory factors on reactive astrocytes (some semaphorins and ephrins). However, at the lesion site not only growth inhibitory molecules are found but also neurite growth stimulating factors like neurotrophins, laminin, Ll and others. This ensemble of neurite growth inhibitory and growth promoting molecules may explain that blocking single factors, like NogoA or RGM A, resulted in significant functional recovery in rodent SCI models, because a reduction of the inhibitory influences could shift the balance from growth inhibition to growth promotion. However, recoveries observed with blocking a single neurite outgrowth inhibitory molecule were not complete. To achieve faster and more pronounced recoveries either blocking two neurite outgrowth inhibitory molecules e.g Nogo and RGM A, or blocking an neurite outgrowth inhibitory molecule and enhancing functions of a neurite outgrowth enhancing molecule e.g Nogo and neurotrophins, or blocking a neurite outgrowth inhibitory moleclule e.g.,Nogo and a pro-inflammatory molecule e.g.,TNF, may be desirable (see McGee AW, et al., Trends Neurosci. 2003;26:193; Marco Domeniconi, et al., J Neurol Sci. 2005;233:43; Milan Makwanal, et al., FEBS J. 2005;272:2628; Barry J. Dickson, Science. 2002;298:1959; Felicia Yu Hsuan Teng, et al., J Neurosci Res. 2005;79:273; Tara Karnezis, et al., Nature Neuroscience 2004; 7, 736; Gang Xu, et al., J. Neurochem.2004; 91; 1018).\n\n\nIn one aspect, DVD-Igs capable of binding target pairs such as NgR and RGM A; NogoA and RGM A; MAG and RGM A; OMGp and RGM A; RGM A and RGM B; RGM A and Semaphorin 3A; RGM A and Semaphorin 4; CSPGs and RGM A; aggrecan, midkine, neurocan, versican, phosphacan, Te38 and TNF-α; AB globulomer-specific antibodies combined with antibodies promoting dendrite & axon sprouting are provided. Dendrite pathology and axon damage, or neuritic dystrophy are a very early sign of AD and it is known that NOGO A restricts dendrite growth and that the other molecules associated with myelin and mentioned above e.g., RGM A, MAG, OMGp impair axonal regrowth. One can combine such type of ab with any of the SCI-candidate (myelin-proteins) Ab. Other DVD-Ig targets may include any combination of NgR-p75, NgR-Troy, NgR-Nogo66 (Nogo), NgR-Lingo, Lingo-Troy, Lingo-p75, MAG or Omgp. Additionally, targets may also include any mediator, soluble or cell surface, implicated in inhibition of neurite e.g Nogo, Ompg, MAG, RGM A, semaphorins, ephrins, soluble A-b, proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-I), chemokines (e.g., MIP Ia), molecules that inhibit nerve regeneration. The efficacy of anti-nogo / anti-RGM A or similar DVD-Ig molecules can be validated in pre-clinical animal models of spinal cord injury. In addition, these DVD-Ig molecules can be constructed and tested for efficacy in the animal models and the best therapeutic DVD-Ig can be selected for testing in human patients. In addition, DVD-Ig molecules can be \n\n constructed that target two distinct ligand binding sites on a single receptor e.g., Nogo receptor which binds three ligand Nogo, OMGp, and MAG and RAGE that binds A-b and SlOO A. Furthermore, neurite outgrowth inihibitors e.g., nogo and nogo receptor, also play a role in preventing nerve regeneration in immunological diseases like multiple sclerosis. Inhibition of nogo-nogo receptor interaction has been shown to enhance recovery in animal models of multiple sclerosis. Therefore, DVD-Ig molecules that can block the function of one immune mediator e.g., a cytokine like IL-12 and a neurite outgrowth inhibitor molecule e.g., nogo or RGM may offer faster and greater efficacy than blocking either an immune or an neurite outgrowth inhibitor molecule alone.\n\n\nIn general, antibodies do not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) in an efficient and relevant manner. However, in certain neurologic diseases, e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, etc., the BBB may be compromised and allows for increased penetration of DVD-Igs and antibodies into the brain. In other neurological conditions, where BBB leakage is not occurring, one may employ the targeting of endogenous transport systems, including carrier- mediated transporters such as glucose and amino acid carriers and receptor-mediated transcytosis- mediating cell structures/receptors at the vascular endothelium of the BBB, thus enabling trans- BBB transport of the DVD-Ig. Structures at the BBB enabling such transport include but are not limited to the insulin receptor, transferrin receptor, LRP and RAGE. In addition, strategies enable the use of DVD-Igs also as shuttles to transport potential drugs into the CNS including low molecular weight drugs, nanoparticles and nucleic acids (Coloma MJ, et al. (2000) Pharm Res. 17(3):266-74; Boado RJ, et al. (2007) Bioconjug. Chem. 18(2):447-55).\n\n\nDVD Igs capable of binding the following pairs of targets to treat neurological disease are contemplated: Abeta (seq. 1) and Abeta (seq. 3); TNF and Abeta (seq. 2); IL-Ib and Abeta (seq. 2); Abeta (seq. 1) and Abeta (seq. 2); IGF1,2 and Abeta (seq. 2); Abeta (seq. 2) and IL-18; IL-6 and Abeta (seq. 2); TNF and Abeta (seq.3); IL-Ib and Abeta (seq. 3); Abeta (seq. 1) and Abeta (seq. 3); IGF1,2 and Abeta (seq. 3); Abeta (seq. 3) and IL-18; IL-6 and Abeta (seq. 3); TNF and Abeta (seq. 1); IL-Ib and Abeta (seq. 1); IGF1,2 and Abeta (seq. 1); Abeta (seq. 1) and IL-18; IL- 6 and Abeta (seq. 1); Abeta (seq. 1) and RAGE; NGF and IL-18; NGF and IL-Ib; NGF and IL-6; TNF and EGFR (seq. 2); TNF and RAGE; CD-20 and EGFR (seq. 1); CD-20 and EGFR (seq. 2); RGMA and TNF (see Examples 2.1 to 2.27)\n\n\n8. Oncological disorders\n\n\nMonoclonal antibody therapy has emerged as an important therapeutic modality for cancer (von Mehren, M, et al. (2003) Annu. Rev. Med. 54:343-69). Antibodies may exert antitumor effects by inducing apoptosis, redirected cytotoxicity, interfering with ligand-receptor \n\n interactions, or preventing the expression of proteins that are critical to the neoplastic phenotype. In addition, antibodies can target components of the tumor microenvironment, perturbing vital structures such as the formation of tumor-associated vasculature. Antibodies can also target receptors whose ligands are growth factors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor. The antibody thus inhibits natural ligands that stimulate cell growth from binding to targeted tumor cells. Alternatively, antibodies may induce an anti-idiotype network, complement-mediated cytotoxicity, or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The use of dual-specific antibody that targets two separate tumor mediators will likely give additional benefit compared to a mono-specific therapy.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a DVD of the invention is capable of binding VEGF and phosphatidylserine; VEGF and ErbB3; VEGF and PLGF; VEGF and ROBO4; VEGF and BSG2; VEGF and CDCPl ; VEGF and ANPEP; VEGF and c-MET; HER-2 and ERB3; HER-2 and BSG2; HER-2 and CDCPl ; HER-2 and ANPEP; EGFR and CD64; EGFR and BSG2; EGFR and CDCPl ; EGFR and ANPEP; IGFlR and PDGFR; IGFlR and VEGF; IGFlR and CD20; CD20 and CD74; CD20 and CD30; CD20 and DR4; CD20 and VEGFR2; CD20 and CD52; CD20 and CD4; HGF and c-MET; HGF and NRPl; HGF and phosphatidylserine; ErbB3 and lGFIR; ErbB3 and IGF 1,2; c-Met and Her-2; c-Met and NRPl ; c-Met and IGFlR; IGF 1,2 and PDGFR; IGF 1,2 and CD20; IGF 1,2 and IGFlR; IGF2 and EGFR; IGF2 and HER2; IGF2 and CD20; IGF2 and VEGF; IGF2 and IGFlR; IGFl and IGF2; PDGFRa and VEGFR2; PDGFRa and PLGF; PDGFRa and VEGF; PDGFRa and c-Met; PDGFRa and EGFR; PDGFRb and VEGFR2; PDGFRb and c- Met; PDGFRb and EGFR; RON and c-Met; RON and MTSPl ; RON and MSP; RON and CDCPl ; VGFRl and PLGF; VGFRl and RON; VGFRl and EGFR; VEGFR2 and PLGF; VEGFR2 and NRPl ; VEGFR2 and RON; VEGFR2 and DLL4; VEGFR2 and EGFR; VEGFR2 and ROBO4; VEGFR2 and CD55; LPA and SlP; EPHB2 and RON; CTLA4 and VEGF; CD3 and EPCAM; CD40 and IL6; CD40 and IGF; CD40 and CD56; CD40 and CD70; CD40 and VEGFRl; CD40 and DR5; CD40 and DR4; CD40 and APRIL; CD40 and BCMA; CD40 and RANKL; CD28 and MAPG; CD80 and CD40; CD80 and CD30; CD80 and CD33; CD80 and CD74; CD80 and CD2; CD80 and CD3; CD80 and CD19; CD80 and CD4; CD80 and CD52; CD80 and VEGF; CD80 and DR5; CD80 and VEGFR2; CD22 and CD20; CD22 and CD80; CD22 and CD40; CD22 and CD23; CD22 and CD33; CD22 and CD74; CD22 and CD19; CD22 and DR5; CD22 and DR4; CD22 and VEGF; CD22 and CD52; CD30 and CD20; CD30 and CD22; CD30 and CD23; CD30 and CD40; CD30 and VEGF; CD30 and CD74; CD30 and CDl 9; CD30 and DR5; CD30 and DR4; CD30 and VEGFR2; CD30 and CD52; CD30 and CD4; CD138 and RANKL; CD33 and FTL3; CD33 and VEGF; CD33 and VEGFR2; CD33 and CD44; CD33 and DR4; CD33 and DR5; DR4 and CD137; DR4 and IGF1,2; DR4 and IGFlR; DR4 and DR5; DR5 and CD40; DR5 and CD137; DR5 and CD20; DR5 and EGFR; DR5 and IGF1,2; DR5 and \n\n IGFR, DR5 and HER-2, and EGFR and DLL4.

Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThe invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a binding protein, of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions comprising binding proteins of the invention are for use in, but not limited to, diagnosing, detecting, or monitoring a disorder, in preventing, treating, managing, or ameliorating of a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof, and/or in research. In a specific embodiment, a composition comprises one or more binding proteins of the invention. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises one or more binding proteins of the invention and one or more prophylactic or therapeutic agents other than binding proteins of the invention for treating a disorder. In an embodiment, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents known to be useful for or having been or currently being used in the prevention, treatment, management, or amelioration of a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof. In accordance with these embodiments, the composition may further comprise of a carrier, diluent or excipient.\n\n\nThe binding proteins of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to a subject. Typically, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a binding protein of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, \n\n coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include one or more of water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like, as well as combinations thereof. In some embodiments, isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride, are included in the composition.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable carriers may further comprise minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, preservatives or buffers, which enhance the shelf life or effectiveness of the antibody or antibody portion.\n\n\nVarious delivery systems are known and can be used to administer one or more antibodies of the invention or the combination of one or more antibodies of the invention and a prophylactic agent or therapeutic agent useful for preventing, managing, treating, or ameliorating a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, recombinant cells capable of expressing the antibody or antibody fragment, receptor- mediated endocytosis (see, e. g., Wu and Wu, J. Biol. Chem. 262:4429-4432 (1987)), construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector, etc. Methods of administering a prophylactic or therapeutic agent of the invention include, but are not limited to, parenteral administration (e.g., intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous and subcutaneous) , epidurala administration, intratumoral administration, and mucosal adminsitration (e.g., intranasal and oral routes). In addition, pulmonary administration can be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,019,968; 5,985,320; 5,985,309; 5,934,272; 5,874,064; 5,855,913; 5,290,540; and 4,880,078; and PCT Publication Nos. WO 92/19244; WO 97/32572; WO 97/44013; WO 98/31346; and WO 99/66903, each of which is incorporated herein by reference their entireties. In one embodiment, a binding protein of the invention, combination therapy, or a composition of the invention is administered using Alkermes AIR® pulmonary drug delivery technology (Alkermes, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.). In a specific embodiment, prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the invention are administered intramuscularly, intravenously, intratumorally, orally, intranasally, pulmonary, or subcutaneously. The prophylactic or therapeutic agents may be administered by any convenient route, for example by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral mucosa, rectal and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local.\n\n\nIn an embodiment, specific binding of antibody-coupled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to tumor cells in vitro, followed by their highly specific ablation with near-infrared (NIR) light can be used to target tumor cells. For example, biotinylated polar lipids can be used to prepare stable, biocompatible, noncytotoxic CNT dispersions that are then attached to one or two different \n\n neutralite avidin-derivatized DVD-Igs directed against one or more tumor antigens (e.g., CD22) (Chakravarty, P. et al. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105:8697-8702.\n\n\nIn a specific embodiment, it may be desirable to administer the prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment; this may be achieved by, for example, and not by way of limitation, local infusion, by injection, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous or non-porous material, including membranes and matrices, such as sialastic membranes, polymers, fibrous matrices (e.g., Tissuel®), or collagen matrices. In one embodiment, an effective amount of one or more antibodies of the invention antagonists is administered locally to the affected area to a subject to prevent, treat, manage, and/or ameliorate a disorder or a symptom thereof. In another embodiment, an effective amount of one or more antibodies of the invention is administered locally to the affected area in combination with an effective amount of one or more therapies (e. g., one or more prophylactic or therapeutic agents) other than a binding protein of the invention of a subject to prevent, treat, manage, and/or ameliorate a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the prophylactic or therapeutic agent can be delivered in a controlled release or sustained release system. In one embodiment, a pump may be used to achieve controlled or sustained release (see Langer, supra; Sefton, 1987, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:20; Buchwald et al., 1980, Surgery 88:507; Saudek et al., 1989, N. Engl. J. Med. 321 :574). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used to achieve controlled or sustained release of the therapies of the invention (see e.g., Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Langer and Wise (eds.), CRC Pres., Boca Raton, FIa. (1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance, Smolen and Ball (eds.), Wiley, New York (1984); Ranger and Peppas, 1983, J., Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61; see also Levy et al., 1985, Science 228:190; During et al., 1989, Ann. Neurol. 25:351 ; Howard et al., 1989, J. Neurosurg. 7 1 :105); U.S. Pat. No. 5,679,377; U.S. Pat. No. 5, 916,597; U. S. Pat. No. 5,912,015; U.S. Pat. No.\n\n\n5,989,463; U.S. Pat. No. 5,128,326; PCT Publication No. WO 99/15154; and PCT Publication No. WO 99/20253. Examples of polymers used in sustained release formulations include, but are not limited to, poly(2 -hydroxy ethyl methacrylate), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic acid), poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate), poly(methacrylic acid), polyglycolides (PLG), polyanhydrides, poly(N- vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyacrylamide, poly(ethylene glycol), polylactides (PLA), poly(lactide-co-glycolides) (PLGA), and polyorthoesters. In an embodiment, the polymer used in a sustained release formulation is inert, free of leachable impurities, stable on storage, sterile, and biodegradable. In yet another embodiment, a controlled or sustained release system can be placed in proximity of the prophylactic or therapeutic target, thus requiring only a \n\n fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)).\n\n\nControlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (1990, Science 249:1527-1533). Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more therapeutic agents of the invention. See, e.g., U. S. Pat. No. 4,526, 938, PCT publication WO 91/05548, PCT publication WO 96/20698, Ning et al. , 1996, \"Intratumoral Radioimmunotheraphy of a Human Colon Cancer Xenograft Using a Sustained-Release Gel,\" Radiotherapy &Oncology 39:179-189, Song et al., 1995, \"Antibody Mediated Lung Targeting of Long- Circulating Emulsions,\" PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science &Technology 50:372-397, Cleek et al., 1997, \"Biodegradable Polymeric Carriers for a bFGF Antibody for Cardiovascular Application,\" Pro.

Bioact. Mater. 24:759- 760, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\n\n\nIn a specific embodiment, where the composition of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding a prophylactic or therapeutic agent, the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded prophylactic or therapeutic agent, by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular, e.g., by use of a retroviral vector (see U. S. Pat. No. 4,980,286), or by direct injection, or by use of microparticle bombardment (e.g., a gene gun; Biolistic, Dupont), or coating with lipids or cell- surface receptors or transfecting agents, or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox-like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus (see, e.g., Joliot et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:1864-1868). Alternatively, a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination.\n\n\nA pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include, but are not limited to, parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral, intranasal (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (e.g., topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. In a specific embodiment, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, oral, intranasal, or topical administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocamne to ease pain at the site of the injection. \n\n If the compositions of the invention are to be administered topically, the compositions can be formulated in the form of an ointment, cream, transdermal patch, lotion, gel, shampoo, spray, aerosol, solution, emulsion, or other form well-known to one of skill in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences and Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, 19th ed., Mack Pub. Co., Easton, Pa. (1995). In an embodiment, for non- sprayable topical dosage forms, viscous to semi-solid or solid forms comprising a carrier or one or more excipients compatible with topical application and having a dynamic viscosity greater than water are employed. Suitable formulations include, without limitation, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, creams, ointments, powders, liniments, salves, and the like, which are, if desired, sterilized or mixed with auxiliary agents (e.g., preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, buffers, or salts) for influencing various properties, such as, for example, osmotic pressure. Other suitable topical dosage forms include sprayable aerosol preparations wherein the active ingredient, in an embodiment, in combination with a solid or liquid inert carrier, is packaged in a mixture with a pressurized volatile (e.g., a gaseous propellant, such as freon) or in a squeeze bottle. Moisturizers or humectants can also be added to pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms if desired. Examples of such additional ingredients are well-known in the art.\n\n\nIf the method of the invention comprises intranasal administration of a composition, the composition can be formulated in an aerosol form, spray, mist or in the form of drops. In particular, prophylactic or therapeutic agents for use according to the present invention can be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant (e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas). In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges (composed of, e.g., gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.\n\n\nIf the method of the invention comprises oral administration, compositions can be formulated orally in the form of tablets, capsules, cachets, gelcaps, solutions, suspensions, and the like. Tablets or capsules can be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, or calcium hydrogen phosphate) ; lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate) ; or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well-known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, but not limited to, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they \n\n may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives, or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol, or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl-p- hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer salts, flavoring, coloring, and sweetening agents as appropriate. Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated for slow release, controlled release, or sustained release of a prophylactic or therapeutic agent(s).\n\n\nThe method of the invention may comprise pulmonary administration, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, of a composition formulated with an aerosolizing agent. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,019,968; 5,985,320; 5,985,309; 5,934,272; 5,874,064; 5,855,913; 5,290,540; and 4,880,078; and PCT Publication Nos. WO 92/19244; WO 97/32572; WO 97/44013; WO 98/31346; and WO 99/66903, each of which is incorporated herein by reference their entireties. In a specific embodiment, a binding protein of the invention, combination therapy, and/or composition of the invention is administered using Alkermes AIR® pulmonary drug delivery technology (Alkermes, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.).\n\n\nThe method of the invention may comprise administration of a composition formulated for parenteral administration by injection (e. g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion). Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form (e.g., in ampoules or in multi- dose containers) with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle (e.g., sterile pyrogen- free water) before use.\n\n\nThe methods of the invention may additionally comprise of administration of compositions formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (e.g., subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compositions may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (e.g., as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives (e.g., as a sparingly soluble salt).\n\n\nThe methods of the invention encompasse administration of compositions formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric, phosphoric, acetic, oxalic, tartaric acids, etc., and those formed \n\n with cations such as those derived from sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2- ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, etc.\n\n\nGenerally, the ingredients of compositions are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the mode of administration is infusion, composition can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the mode of administration is by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\nIn particular, the invention also provides that one or more of the prophylactic or therapeutic agents, or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is packaged in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of the agent. In one embodiment, one or more of the prophylactic or therapeutic agents, or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is supplied as a dry sterilized lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container and can be reconstituted (e.g., with water or saline) to the appropriate concentration for administration to a subject. In an embodiment, one or more of the prophylactic or therapeutic agents or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is supplied as a dry sterile lyophilized powder in a hermetically sealed container at a unit dosage of at least 5 mg, at least 10 mg, at least 15 mg, at least 25 mg, at least 35 mg, at least 45 mg, at least 50 mg, at least 75 mg, or at least 100 mg. The lyophilized prophylactic or therapeutic agents or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention should be stored at between 2° C. and 8° C. in its original container and the prophylactic or therapeutic agents, or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention should be administered within 1 week, e.g., within 5 days, within 72 hours, within 48 hours, within 24 hours, within 12 hours, within 6 hours, within 5 hours, within 3 hours, or within 1 hour after being reconstituted. In an alternative embodiment, one or more of the prophylactic or therapeutic agents or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention is supplied in liquid form in a hermetically sealed container indicating the quantity and concentration of the agent. In an embodiment, the liquid form of the administered composition is supplied in a hermetically sealed container at least 0.25 mg/ml, at least 0.5 mg/ml, at least 1 mg/ml, at least 2.5 mg/ml, at least 5 mg/ml, at least 8 mg/ml, at least 10 mg/ml, at least 15 mg/kg, at least 25 mg/ml, at least 50 mg/ml, at least 75 mg/ml or at least 100 mg/ml. The liquid form should be stored at between 2° C. and 8° C. in its original container.\n\n\nThe binding proteins of the invention can be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition suitable for parenteral administration. In an embodiment, the antibody or antibody- portions will be prepared as an injectable solution containing 0.1-250 mg/ml binding protein. The \n\n injectable solution can be composed of either a liquid or lyophilized dosage form in a flint or amber vial, ampule or pre-filled syringe. The buffer can be L-histidine (1-50 mM), optimally 5- 1OmM, at pH 5.0 to 7.0 (optimally pH 6.0). Other suitable buffers include but are not limited to, sodium succinate, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate or potassium phosphate. Sodium chloride can be used to modify the toxicity of the solution at a concentration of 0-300 mM (optimally 150 mM for a liquid dosage form). Cryoprotectants can be included for a lyophilized dosage form, principally 0-10% sucrose (optimally 0.5-1.0%). Other suitable cryoprotectants include trehalose and lactose. Bulking agents can be included for a lyophilized dosage form, principally 1-10% mannitol (optimally 2-4%). Stabilizers can be used in both liquid and lyophilized dosage forms, principally 1-50 mM L-Methionine (optimally 5-10 mM). Other suitable bulking agents include glycine, arginine, can be included as 0-0.05% polysorbate-80 (optimally 0.005-0.01%). Additional surfactants include but are not limited to polysorbate 20 and BRIJ surfactants. The pharmaceutical composition comprising the binding proteins of the invention prepared as an injectable solution for parenteral administration, can further comprise an agent useful as an adjuvant, such as those used to increase the absorption, or dispersion of a therapeutic protein (e.g., antibody). A particularly useful adjuvant is hyaluronidase, such as Hylenex® (recombinant human hyaluronidase). Addition of hyaluronidase in the injectable solution improves human bioavailability following parenteral administration, particularly subcutaneous administration. It also allows for greater injection site volumes (i.e. greater than 1 ml) with less pain and discomfort, and minimum incidence of injection site reactions, (see WO2004078140, and US2006104968 incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\nThe compositions of this invention may be in a variety of forms. These include, for example, liquid, semi-solid and solid dosage forms, such as liquid solutions (e.g., injectable and infusible solutions), dispersions or suspensions, tablets, pills, powders, liposomes and suppositories. The form chosen depends on the intended mode of administration and therapeutic application. Typical compositions are in the form of injectable or infusible solutions, such as compositions similar to those used for passive immunization of humans with other antibodies. The chosen mode of administration is parenteral (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular). In an embodiment, the antibody is administered by intravenous infusion or injection. In another embodiment, the antibody is administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.\n\n\nTherapeutic compositions typically must be sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, dispersion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (i.e., antibody or \n\n antibody portion) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated herein, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated herein. In the case of sterile, lyophilized powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the methods of preparation are vacuum drying and spray-drying that yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The proper fluidity of a solution can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of injectable compositions can be brought about by including, in the composition, an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin.\n\n\nThe binding proteins of the present invention can be administered by a variety of methods known in the art, although for many therapeutic applications, in an embodiment, the route/mode of administration is subcutaneous injection, intravenous injection or infusion. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. In certain embodiments, the active compound may be prepared with a carrier that will protect the compound against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Many methods for the preparation of such formulations are patented or generally known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, J.R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a binding protein of the invention may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. The compound (and other ingredients, if desired) may also be enclosed in a hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, compressed into tablets, or incorporated directly into the subject's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the compounds may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. To administer a compound of the invention by other than parenteral administration, it may be necessary to coat the compound with, or co-administer the compound with, a material to prevent its inactivation.\n\n\nSupplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions. In certain embodiments, a binding protein of the invention is coformulated with and/or coadministered with one or more additional therapeutic agents that are useful for treating disorders with binding protein of the invention. For example, a binding protein of the invention \n\n may be co formulated and/or coadministered with one or more additional antibodies that bind other targets (e.g., antibodies that bind other cytokines or that bind cell surface molecules). Furthermore, one or more antibodies of the invention may be used in combination with two or more of the foregoing therapeutic agents. Such combination therapies may advantageously utilize lower dosages of the administered therapeutic agents, thus avoiding possible toxicities or complications associated with the various monotherapies.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a binding protein is linked to a half-life extending vehicle known in the art. Such vehicles include, but are not limited to, the Fc domain, polyethylene glycol, and dextran. Such vehicles are described, e.g., in U.S. Application Serial No. 09/428,082 and published PCT Application No. WO 99/25044, which are hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose.\n\n\nIn a specific embodiment, nucleic acid sequences encoding a binding protein of the invention or another prophylactic or therapeutic agent of the invention are administered to treat, prevent, manage, or ameliorate a disorder or one or more symptoms thereof by way of gene therapy. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids produce their encoded antibody or prophylactic or therapeutic agent of the invention that mediates a prophylactic or therapeutic effect.\n\n\nAny of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention.

The combination can also include more than one additional agent, e.g., two or three additional agents if the combination is such that the formed composition can perform its intended function.\n\n\nCombinations to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug(s) also referred to as NSAIDS which include drugs like ibuprofen. Other combinations are corticosteroids including prednisolone; the well known side-effects of steroid use can be reduced or even eliminated by tapering the steroid dose required when treating patients in combination with the DVD Igs of this invention. Non-limiting examples of therapeutic agents for rheumatoid arthritis with which an antibody, or antibody portion, of the invention can be combined include the following: cytokine suppressive anti-inflammatory drug(s) (CSAIDs); antibodies to or antagonists of other human cytokines or growth factors, for example, TNF, LT, IL-I, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-15, IL-16, IL-18, IL-21, IL-23, interferons, EMAP-II, GM-CSF, FGF, and PDGF.

Yet another combination include key players of the autoimmune response which may act parallel to, dependent on or in concert with IL- 12 function; especially are IL- 18 antagonists including IL- 18 antibodies or soluble IL- 18 receptors, or IL-18 binding proteins. It has been shown that IL- 12 and IL-18 have overlapping but distinct functions and a combination of antagonists to both may be most effective. Yet another combination are non-depleting anti-CD4 inhibitors.

A \"therapeutically effective amount\" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic result. A therapeutically effective amount of the binding protein may be determined by a person skilled in the art and may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the binding protein to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the antibody, or antibody portion, are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A \"prophylactically effective amount\" refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically, since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease, the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.\n\n\nDosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be achieved, and (b) the \n\n limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.\n\n\nAn exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a binding protein of the invention is 0.1-20 mg/kg, for example, 1-10 mg/kg. It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the type and severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition.\n\n\nV. Diagnostics\n\n\nThe disclosure herein also provides diagnostic applications. This is further elucidated below.\n\n\nI. Method of Assay\n\n\nThe present disclosure also provides a method for determining the presence, amount or concentration of an analyte (or a fragment thereof) in a test sample using at least one DVD-Ig as described herein. Any suitable assay as is known in the art can be used in the method. Examples include, but are not limited to, immunoassay, such as sandwich immunoassay (e.g., monoclonal, polyclonal and/or DVD-Ig sandwich immunoassays or any variation thereof (e.g., monoclonal/D VD-Ig, DVD-Ig/polyclonal, etc.), including radioisotope detection\n\n\n(radioimmunoassay (RIA)) and enzyme detection (enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (e.g., Quantikine ELISA assays, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN))), competitive inhibition immunoassay (e.g., forward and reverse), fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA), enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT), bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), and homogeneous chemiluminescent assay, etc. In a SELDI- based immunoassay, a capture reagent that specifically binds an analyte (or a fragment thereof) of interest is attached to the surface of a mass spectrometry probe, such as a pre-activated protein chip array. The analyte (or a fragment thereof) is then specifically captured on the biochip, and the captured analyte (or a fragment thereof) is detected by mass spectrometry. Alternatively, the analyte (or a fragment thereof) can be eluted from the capture reagent and detected by traditional MALDI (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization) or by SELDI. A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay, in particular one employing the ARCHITECT® automated analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), is an example of a preferred immunoassay. \n\n Methods well-known in the art for collecting, handling and processing urine, blood, serum and plasma, and other body fluids, are used in the practice of the present disclosure, for instance, when a DVD-Ig as described herein is employed as an immunodiagnostic reagent and/or in an analyte immunoassay kit. The test sample can comprise further moieties in addition to the analyte of interest, such as antibodies, antigens, haptens, hormones, drugs, enzymes, receptors, proteins, peptides, polypeptides, oligonucleotides and/or polynucleotides. For example, the sample can be a whole blood sample obtained from a subject. It can be necessary or desired that a test sample, particularly whole blood, be treated prior to immunoassay as described herein, e.g., with a pretreatment reagent. Even in cases where pretreatment is not necessary (e.g., most urine samples), pretreatment optionally can be done (e.g., as part of a regimen on a commercial platform).\n\n\nThe pretreatment reagent can be any reagent appropriate for use with the immunoassay and kits of the invention. The pretreatment optionally comprises: (a) one or more solvents (e.g., methanol and ethylene glycol) and optionally, salt, (b) one or more solvents and salt, and optionally, detergent, (c) detergent, or (d) detergent and salt. Pretreatment reagents are known in the art, and such pretreatment can be employed, e.g., as used for assays on Abbott TDx, AxSYM®, and ARCHITECT® analyzers (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), as described in the literature (see, e.g., Yatscoff et al., Abbott TDx Monoclonal Antibody Assay Evaluated for Measuring Cyclosporin in Whole Blood, Clin. Chem. 36: 1969-1973 (1990), and Wallemacq et al., Evaluation of the New AxSYM Cyclosporine Assay: Comparison with TDx Monoclonal Whole Blood and EMIT Cyclosporine Assays, Clin. Chem. 45: 432-435 (1999)), and/or as commercially available. Additionally, pretreatment can be done as described in Abbott's U.S. Pat. No. 5,135,875, European Pat. Pub. No. 0 471 293, U.S Provisional Pat. App. 60/878,017, filed December 29, 2006, and U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2008/0020401 (incorporated by reference in its entirety for its teachings regarding pretreatment). The pretreatment reagent can be a heterogeneous agent or a homogeneous agent.\n\n\nWith use of a heterogeneous pretreatment reagent, the pretreatment reagent precipitates analyte binding protein (e.g., protein that can bind to an analyte or a fragment thereof) present in the sample. Such a pretreatment step comprises removing any analyte binding protein by separating from the precipitated analyte binding protein the supernatant of the mixture formed by addition of the pretreatment agent to sample. In such an assay, the supernatant of the mixture absent any binding protein is used in the assay, proceeding directly to the antibody capture step.\n\n\nWith use of a homogeneous pretreatment reagent there is no such separation step. The entire mixture of test sample and pretreatment reagent are contacted with a labeled specific binding partner for analyte (or a fragment thereof), such as a labeled anti-analyte antibody (or an \n\n antigenically reactive fragment thereof). The pretreatment reagent employed for such an assay typically is diluted in the pretreated test sample mixture, either before or during capture by the first specific binding partner. Despite such dilution, a certain amount of the pretreatment reagent is still present (or remains) in the test sample mixture during capture. According to the invention, the labeled specific binding partner can be a DVD-Ig (or a fragment, a variant, or a fragment of a variant thereof).\n\n\nIn a heterogeneous format, after the test sample is obtained from a subject, a first mixture is prepared. The mixture contains the test sample being assessed for an analyte (or a fragment thereof) and a first specific binding partner, wherein the first specific binding partner and any analyte contained in the test sample form a first specific binding partner-analyte complex.\n\n\nPreferably, the first specific binding partner is an anti-analyte antibody or a fragment thereof. The first specific binding partner can be a DVD-Ig (or a fragment, a variant, or a fragment of a variant thereof) as described herein. The order in which the test sample and the first specific binding partner are added to form the mixture is not critical. Preferably, the first specific binding partner is immobilized on a solid phase. The solid phase used in the immunoassay (for the first specific binding partner and, optionally, the second specific binding partner) can be any solid phase known in the art, such as, but not limited to, a magnetic particle, a bead, a test tube, a microtiter plate, a cuvette, a membrane, a scaffolding molecule, a film, a filter paper, a disc and a chip.\n\n\nAfter the mixture containing the first specific binding partner-analyte complex is formed, any unbound analyte is removed from the complex using any technique known in the art. For example, the unbound analyte can be removed by washing. Desirably, however, the first specific binding partner is present in excess of any analyte present in the test sample, such that all analyte that is present in the test sample is bound by the first specific binding partner.\n\n\nAfter any unbound analyte is removed, a second specific binding partner is added to the mixture to form a first specific binding partner-analyte-second specific binding partner complex. The second specific binding partner is preferably an anti-analyte antibody that binds to an epitope on analyte that differs from the epitope on analyte bound by the first specific binding partner. Moreover, also preferably, the second specific binding partner is labeled with or contains a detectable label as described above. The second specific binding partner can be a DVD-Ig (or a fragment, a variant, or a fragment of a variant thereof) as described herein.\n\n\nAny suitable detectable label as is known in the art can be used. For example, the detectable label can be a radioactive label (such as 3H, 1251, 35S, 14C, 32P, and 33P), an enzymatic label (such as horseradish peroxidase, alkaline peroxidase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and the like), a chemiluminescent label (such as acridinium esters, thioesters, or \n\n sulfonamides; luminol, isoluminol, phenanthridinium esters, and the like), a fluorescent label (such as fluorescein (e.g., 5 -fluorescein, 6-carboxyfluorescein, 3'6-carboxyfiuorescein, 5(6)- carboxyfluorescein, 6-hexachloro-fluorescein, 6-tetrachlorofluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and the like)), rhodamine, phycobiliproteins, R-phycoerythrin, quantum dots (e.g., zinc sulfide-capped cadmium selenide), a thermometric label, or an immuno-polymerase chain reaction label. An introduction to labels, labeling procedures and detection of labels is found in Polak and Van Noorden, Introduction to Immunocytochemistry, 2nd ed., Springer Verlag, N.Y. (1997), and in Haugland, Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals (1996), which is a combined handbook and catalogue published by Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, Oregon. A fluorescent label can be used in FPIA (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,593,896, 5,573,904, 5,496,925, 5,359,093, and 5,352,803, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties). An acridinium compound can be used as a detectable label in a homogeneous or heterogeneous chemiluminescent assay (see, e.g., Adamczyk et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 16: 1324-1328 (2006); Adamczyk et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 4: 2313-2317 (2004); Adamczyk et al., Biorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 14: 3917-3921 (2004); and Adamczyk et al., Org. Lett. 5: 3779- 3782 (2003)).\n\n\nA preferred acridinium compound is an acridinium-9-carboxamide. Methods for preparing acridinium 9-carboxamides are described in Mattingly, J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 6: 107-114 (1991); Adamczyk et al., J. Org. Chem. 63: 5636-5639 (1998); Adamczyk et al., Tetrahedron 55: 10899-10914 (1999); Adamczyk et al., Org. Lett. 1 : 779-781 (1999); Adamczyk et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 11 : 714-724 (2000); Mattingly et al., In Luminescence Biotechnology: Instruments and Applications; Dyke, K. V. Ed.; CRC Press: Boca Raton, pp. 77-105 (2002); Adamczyk et al., Org. Lett. 5: 3779-3782 (2003); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,468,646, 5,543,524 and 5,783,699 (each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for its teachings regarding same). Another preferred acridinium compound is an acridinium-9-carboxylate aryl ester. An example of an acridinium-9-carboxylate aryl ester is 10-methyl-9- (phenoxycarbonyl)acridinium fluorosulfonate (available from Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI). Methods for preparing acridinium 9-carboxylate aryl esters are described in McCapra et al., Photochem. Photobiol. 4: 1111-21 (1965); Razavi et al., Luminescence 15: 245-249 (2000); Razavi et al., Luminescence 15: 239-244 (2000); and U.S. Patent No. 5,241,070 (each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for its teachings regarding same). Further details regarding acridinium-9-carboxylate aryl ester and its use are set forth in US 2008-0248493.\n\n\nChemiluminescent assays (e.g., using acridinium as described above or other chemiluminescent agents) can be performed in accordance with the methods described in Adamczyk et al., Anal. Chim. Acta 579(1): 61-67 (2006). While any suitable assay format can be \n\n used, a microplate chemiluminometer (Mithras LB-940, Berthold Technologies U.S.A., LLC, Oak Ridge, TN) enables the assay of multiple samples of small volumes rapidly.\n\n\nThe order in which the test sample and the specific binding partner(s) are added to form the mixture for chemiluminescent assay is not critical. If the first specific binding partner is detectably labeled with a chemiluminescent agent such as an acridinium compound, detectably labeled first specific binding partner-analyte complexes form. Alternatively, if a second specific binding partner is used and the second specific binding partner is detectably labeled with a chemiluminescent agent such as an acridinium compound, detectably labeled first specific binding partner-analyte-second specific binding partner complexes form. Any unbound specific binding partner, whether labeled or unlabeled, can be removed from the mixture using any technique known in the art, such as washing.\n\n\nHydrogen peroxide can be generated in situ in the mixture or provided or supplied to the mixture (e.g., the source of the hydrogen peroxide being one or more buffers or other solutions that are known to contain hydrogen peroxide) before, simultaneously with, or after the addition of an above-described acridinium compound. Hydrogen peroxide can be generated in situ in a number of ways such as would be apparent to one skilled in the art.\n\n\nUpon the simultaneous or subsequent addition of at least one basic solution to the sample, a detectable signal, namely, a chemiluminescent signal, indicative of the presence of analyte is generated. The basic solution contains at least one base and has a pH greater than or equal to 10, preferably, greater than or equal to 12. Examples of basic solutions include, but are not limited to, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, and calcium bicarbonate. The amount of basic solution added to the sample depends on the concentration of the basic solution. Based on the concentration of the basic solution used, one skilled in the art can easily determine the amount of basic solution to add to the sample.\n\n\nThe chemiluminescent signal that is generated can be detected using routine techniques known to those skilled in the art. Based on the intensity of the signal generated, the amount of analyte in the sample can be quantified. Specifically, the amount of analyte in the sample is proportional to the intensity of the signal generated. The amount of analyte present can be quantified by comparing the amount of light generated to a standard curve for analyte or by comparison to a reference standard. The standard curve can be generated using serial dilutions or solutions of known concentrations of analyte by mass spectroscopy, gravimetric methods, and other techniques known in the art. While the above is described with emphasis on use of an \n\n acridinium compound as the chemiluminescent agent, one of ordinary skill in the art can readily adapt this description for use of other chemiluminescent agents.\n\n\nAnalyte immunoassays generally can be conducted using any format known in the art, such as, but not limited to, a sandwich format. Specifically, in one immunoassay format, at least two antibodies are employed to separate and quantify analyte, such as human analyte, or a fragment thereof in a sample. More specifically, the at least two antibodies bind to different epitopes on an analyte (or a fragment thereof) forming an immune complex, which is referred to as a \"sandwich.\" Generally, in the immunoassays one or more antibodies can be used to capture the analyte (or a fragment thereof) in the test sample (these antibodies are frequently referred to as a \"capture\" antibody or \"capture\" antibodies) and one or more antibodies can be used to bind a detectable (namely, quantifiable) label to the sandwich (these antibodies are frequently referred to as the \"detection antibody,\" the \"detection antibodies,\" the \"conjugate,\" or the \"conjugates\"). Thus, in the context of a sandwich immunoassay format, a DVD-Ig (or a fragment, a variant, or a fragment of a variant thereof) as described herein can be used as a capture antibody, a detection antibody, or both. For example, one DVD-Ig having a domain that can bind a first epitope on an analyte (or a fragment thereof) can be used as a capture antibody and/or another DVD-Ig having a domain that can bind a second epitope on an analyte (or a fragment thereof) can be used as a detection antibody. In this regard, a DVD-Ig having a first domain that can bind a first epitope on an analyte (or a fragment thereof) and a second domain that can bind a second epitope on an analyte (or a fragment thereof) can be used as a capture antibody and/or a detection antibody. Alternatively, one DVD-Ig having a first domain that can bind an epitope on a first analyte (or a fragment thereof) and a second domain that can bind an epitope on a second analyte (or a fragment thereof) can be used as a capture antibody and/or a detection antibody to detect, and optionally quantify, two or more analytes. In the event that an analyte can be present in a sample in more than one form, such as a monomelic form and a dimeric/multimeric form, which can be homomeric or heteromeric, one DVD-Ig having a domain that can bind an epitope that is only exposed on the monomelic form and another DVD-Ig having a domain that can bind an epitope on a different part of a dimeric/multimeric form can be used as capture antibodies and/or detection antibodies, thereby enabling the detection, and optional quantification, of different forms of a given analyte. Furthermore, employing DVD-Igs with differential affinities within a single DVD- Ig and/or between DVD-Igs can provide an avidity advantage. In the context of immunoassays as described herein, it generally may be helpful or desired to incorporate one or more linkers within the structure of a DVD-Ig. When present, optimally the linker should be of sufficient length and structural flexibility to enable binding of an epitope by the inner domains as well as binding of another epitope by the outer domains. In this regard, if a DVD-Ig can bind two different analytes \n\n and one analyte is larger than the other, desirably the larger analyte is bound by the outer domains.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, a sample being tested for (for example, suspected of containing) analyte (or a fragment thereof) can be contacted with at least one capture antibody (or antibodies) and at least one detection antibody (which can be a second detection antibody or a third detection antibody or even a successively numbered antibody, e.g., as where the capture and/or detection antibody comprise multiple antibodies) either simultaneously or sequentially and in any order. For example, the test sample can be first contacted with at least one capture antibody and then (sequentially) with at least one detection antibody. Alternatively, the test sample can be first contacted with at least one detection antibody and then (sequentially) with at least one capture antibody. In yet another alternative, the test sample can be contacted simultaneously with a capture antibody and a detection antibody.\n\n\nIn the sandwich assay format, a sample suspected of containing analyte (or a fragment thereof) is first brought into contact with at least one first capture antibody under conditions that allow the formation of a first antibody/analyte complex. If more than one capture antibody is used, a first capture antibody/analyte complex comprising two or more capture antibodies is formed. In a sandwich assay, the antibodies, i.e., preferably, the at least one capture antibody, are used in molar excess amounts of the maximum amount of analyte (or a fragment thereof) expected in the test sample. For example, from about 5 μg to about 1 mg of antibody per mL of buffer (e.g., microparticle coating buffer) can be used.\n\n\nCompetitive inhibition immunoassays, which are often used to measure small analytes because binding by only one antibody is required, comprise sequential and classic formats. In a sequential competitive inhibition immunoassay a capture antibody to an analyte of interest is coated onto a well of a microtiter plate or other solid support. When the sample containing the analyte of interest is added to the well, the analyte of interest binds to the capture antibody. After washing, a known amount of labeled (e.g., biotin or horseradish peroxidase (HRP)) analyte is added to the well. A substrate for an enzymatic label is necessary to generate a signal. An example of a suitable substrate for HRP is 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). After washing, the signal generated by the labeled analyte is measured and is inversely proportional to the amount of analyte in the sample. In a classic competitive inhibition immunoassay an antibody to an analyte of interest is coated onto a solid support (e.g., a well of a microtiter plate). However, unlike the sequential competitive inhibition immunoassay, the sample and the labeled analyte are added to the well at the same time. Any analyte in the sample competes with labeled analyte for binding to the capture antibody. After washing, the signal generated by the labeled analyte is measured and is inversely proportional to the amount of analyte in the sample. \n\n Optionally, prior to contacting the test sample with the at least one capture antibody (for example, the first capture antibody), the at least one capture antibody can be bound to a solid support, which facilitates the separation of the first antibody/analyte (or a fragment thereof) complex from the test sample. The substrate to which the capture antibody is bound can be any suitable solid support or solid phase that facilitates separation of the capture antibody-analyte complex from the sample.\n\n\nExamples include a well of a plate, such as a microtiter plate, a test tube, a porous gel (e.g., silica gel, agarose, dextran, or gelatin), a polymeric film (e.g., polyacrylamide), beads (e.g., polystyrene beads or magnetic beads), a strip of a filter/membrane (e.g., nitrocellulose or nylon), microparticles (e.g., latex particles, magnetizable microparticles (e.g., microparticles having ferric oxide or chromium oxide cores and homo- or hetero-polymeric coats and radii of about 1-10 microns). The substrate can comprise a suitable porous material with a suitable surface affinity to bind antigens and sufficient porosity to allow access by detection antibodies. A microporous material is generally preferred, although a gelatinous material in a hydrated state can be used. Such porous substrates are preferably in the form of sheets having a thickness of about 0.01 to about 0.5 mm, preferably about 0.1 mm. While the pore size may vary quite a bit, preferably the pore size is from about 0.025 to about 15 microns, more preferably from about 0.15 to about 15 microns. The surface of such substrates can be activated by chemical processes that cause covalent linkage of an antibody to the substrate. Irreversible binding, generally by adsorption through hydrophobic forces, of the antigen or the antibody to the substrate results; alternatively, a chemical coupling agent or other means can be used to bind covalently the antibody to the substrate, provided that such binding does not interfere with the ability of the antibody to bind to analyte. Alternatively, the antibody can be bound with microparticles, which have been previously coated with streptavidin (e.g., DYNAL® Magnetic Beads, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or biotin (e.g., using Power-BindTM-SA-MP streptavidin-coated microparticles (Seradyn,\n\n\nIndianapolis, IN)) or anti-species-specific monoclonal antibodies. If necessary, the substrate can be derivatized to allow reactivity with various functional groups on the antibody. Such derivatization requires the use of certain coupling agents, examples of which include, but are not limited to, maleic anhydride, N-hydroxysuccinimide, and l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide. If desired, one or more capture reagents, such as antibodies (or fragments thereof), each of which is specific for analyte(s) can be attached to solid phases in different physical or addressable locations (e.g., such as in a biochip configuration (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,225,047; Int'l Pat. App. Pub. No. WO 99/51773; U.S. Pat. No. 6,329,209; Int'l Pat. App. Pub. No. WO 00/56934, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,242,828). If the capture reagent is attached to a mass spectrometry probe as the solid support, the amount of analyte bound to the probe can be detected by laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Alternatively, a single column can be packed with \n\n different beads, which are derivatized with the one or more capture reagents, thereby capturing the analyte in a single place (see, antibody-derivatized, bead-based technologies, e.g., the xMAP technology of Luminex (Austin, TX)).\n\n\nAfter the test sample being assayed for analyte (or a fragment thereof) is brought into contact with the at least one capture antibody (for example, the first capture antibody), the mixture is incubated in order to allow for the formation of a first antibody (or multiple antibody)- analyte (or a fragment thereof) complex. The incubation can be carried out at a pH of from about 4.5 to about 10.0, at a temperature of from about 2°C to about 45\n0\nC, and for a period from at least about one (1) minute to about eighteen (18) hours, preferably from about 1 to about 24 minutes, most preferably for about 4 to about 18 minutes. The immunoassay described herein can be conducted in one step (meaning the test sample, at least one capture antibody and at\n\n\nleast one detection antibody are all added sequentially or simultaneously to a reaction vessel) or in more than one step, such as two steps, three steps, etc.\n\n\nAfter formation of the (first or multiple) capture antibody/analyte (or a fragment thereof) complex, the complex is then contacted with at least one detection antibody under conditions which allow for the formation of a (first or multiple) capture antibody/analyte (or a fragment thereof)/second detection antibody complex). While captioned for clarity as the \"second\" antibody (e.g., second detection antibody), in fact, where multiple antibodies are used for capture and/or detection, the at least one detection antibody can be the second, third, fourth, etc. antibodies used in the immunoassay. If the capture antibody/analyte (or a fragment thereof) complex is contacted with more than one detection antibody, then a (first or multiple) capture antibody/analyte (or a fragment thereof)/(multiple) detection antibody complex is formed. As with the capture antibody (e.g., the first capture antibody), when the at least one (e.g., second and any subsequent) detection antibody is brought into contact with the capture antibody/analyte (or a fragment thereof) complex, a period of incubation under conditions similar to those described above is required for the formation of the (first or multiple) capture antibody/analyte (or a fragment thereof)/(second or multiple) detection antibody complex. Preferably, at least one detection antibody contains a detectable label. The detectable label can be bound to the at least one detection antibody (e.g., the second detection antibody) prior to, simultaneously with, or after the formation of the (first or multiple) capture antibody/analyte (or a fragment thereof)/(second or multiple) detection antibody complex. Any detectable label known in the art can be used (see discussion above, including of the Polak and Van Noorden (1997) and Haugland (1996) references). \n\n The detectable label can be bound to the antibodies either directly or through a coupling agent. An example of a coupling agent that can be used is EDAC (l-ethyl-3-(3- dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide, hydrochloride), which is commercially available from Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO. Other coupling agents that can be used are known in the art. Methods for binding a detectable label to an antibody are known in the art. Additionally, many detectable labels can be purchased or synthesized that already contain end groups that facilitate the coupling of the detectable label to the antibody, such as CPSP-Acridinium Ester (i.e., 9-[N- tosyl-N-(3-carboxypropyl)]-10-(3-sulfopropyl)acridinium carboxamide) or SPSP-Acridinium Ester (i.e., N10-(3-sulfopropyl)-N-(3-sulfopropyl)-acridinium-9-carboxamide).\n\n\nThe (first or multiple) capture antibody/analyte/(second or multiple) detection antibody complex can be, but does not have to be, separated from the remainder of the test sample prior to quantification of the label. For example, if the at least one capture antibody (e.g., the first capture antibody) is bound to a solid support, such as a well or a bead, separation can be accomplished by removing the fluid (of the test sample) from contact with the solid support. Alternatively, if the at least first capture antibody is bound to a solid support, it can be simultaneously contacted with the analyte-containing sample and the at least one second detection antibody to form a first (multiple) antibody/analyte/second (multiple) antibody complex, followed by removal of the fluid (test sample) from contact with the solid support. If the at least one first capture antibody is not bound to a solid support, then the (first or multiple) capture antibody/analyte/(second or multiple) detection antibody complex does not have to be removed from the test sample for quantification of the amount of the label.\n\n\nAfter formation of the labeled capture antibody/analyte/detection antibody complex (e.g., the first capture antibody/analyte/second detection antibody complex), the amount of label in the complex is quantified using techniques known in the art. For example, if an enzymatic label is used, the labeled complex is reacted with a substrate for the label that gives a quantifiable reaction such as the development of color. If the label is a radioactive label, the label is quantified using appropriate means, such as a scintillation counter. If the label is a fluorescent label, the label is quantified by stimulating the label with a light of one color (which is known as the \"excitation wavelength\") and detecting another color (which is known as the \"emission wavelength\") that is emitted by the label in response to the stimulation. If the label is a chemiluminescent label, the label is quantified by detecting the light emitted either visually or by using luminometers, x-ray film, high speed photographic film, a CCD camera, etc. Once the amount of the label in the complex has been quantified, the concentration of analyte or a fragment thereof in the test sample is determined by appropriate means, such as by use of a standard curve that has been generated using serial dilutions of analyte or a fragment thereof of known concentration. Other than using \n\n serial dilutions of analyte or a fragment thereof, the standard curve can be generated gravimetrically, by mass spectroscopy and by other techniques known in the art.\n\n\nIn a chemiluminescent microparticle assay employing the ARCHITECT® analyzer, the conjugate diluent pH should be about 6.0 +/- 0.2, the microparticle coating buffer should be maintained at about room temperature (i.e., at from about 17 to about 27 5C), the microparticle coating buffer pH should be about 6.5 +/- 0.2, and the microparticle diluent pH should be about 7.8 +/- 0.2. Solids preferably are less than about 0.2%, such as less than about 0.15%, less than about 0.14%, less than about 0.13%, less than about 0.12%, or less than about 0.11%, such as about 0.10%.\n\n\nFPIAs are based on competitive binding immunoassay principles. A fluorescently labeled compound, when excited by a linearly polarized light, will emit fluorescence having a degree of polarization inversely proportional to its rate of rotation. When a fluorescently labeled tracer- antibody complex is excited by a linearly polarized light, the emitted light remains highly polarized because the fluorophore is constrained from rotating between the time light is absorbed and the time light is emitted. When a \"free\" tracer compound (i.e., a compound that is not bound to an antibody) is excited by linearly polarized light, its rotation is much faster than the corresponding tracer-antibody conjugate produced in a competitive binding immunoassay. FPIAs are advantageous over RIAs inasmuch as there are no radioactive substances requiring special handling and disposal. In addition, FPIAs are homogeneous assays that can be easily and rapidly performed.\n\n\nIn view of the above, a method of determining the presence, amount, or concentration of analyte (or a fragment thereof) in a test sample is provided. The method comprises assaying the test sample for an analyte (or a fragment thereof) by an assay (i) employing (i') at least one of an antibody, a fragment of an antibody that can bind to an analyte, a variant of an antibody that can bind to an analyte, a fragment of a variant of an antibody that can bind to an analyte, and a DVD- Ig (or a fragment, a variant, or a fragment of a variant thereof) that can bind to an analyte, and (ii') at least one detectable label and (ii) comprising comparing a signal generated by the detectable label as a direct or indirect indication of the presence, amount or concentration of analyte (or a fragment thereof) in the test sample to a signal generated as a direct or indirect indication of the presence, amount or concentration of analyte (or a fragment thereof) in a control or calibrator. The calibrator is optionally part of a series of calibrators, in which each of the calibrators differs from the other calibrators by the concentration of analyte.\n\n\nThe method can comprise (i) contacting the test sample with at least one first specific binding partner for analyte (or a fragment thereof) selected from the group consisting of an \n\n antibody, a fragment of an antibody that can bind to an analyte, a variant of an antibody that can bind to an analyte, a fragment of a variant of an antibody that can bind to an analyte, and a DVD- Ig (or a fragment, a variant, or a fragment of a variant thereof) that can bind to an analyte so as to form a first specific binding partner/analyte (or fragment thereof) complex, (ii) contacting the first specific binding partner/analyte (or fragment thereof) complex with at least one second specific binding partner for analyte (or fragment thereof) selected from the group consisting of a detectably labeled anti-analyte antibody, a detectably labeled fragment of an anti-analyte antibody that can bind to analyte, a detectably labeled variant of an anti-analyte antibody that can bind to analyte, a detectably labeled fragment of a variant of an anti-analyte antibody that can bind to analyte, and a detectably labeled DVD-Ig (or a fragment, a variant, or a fragment of a variant thereof) so as to form a first specific binding partner/analyte (or fragment thereof)/second specific binding partner complex, and (iii) determining the presence, amount or concentration of analyte in the test sample by detecting or measuring the signal generated by the detectable label in the first specific binding partner/analyte (or fragment thereofj/second specific binding partner complex formed in (ii). A method in which at least one first specific binding partner for analyte (or a fragment thereof) and/or at least one second specific binding partner for analyte (or a fragment thereof) is a DVD-Ig (or a fragment, a variant, or a fragment of a variant thereof) as described herein can be preferred.\n\n\nAlternatively, the method can comprise contacting the test sample with at least one first specific binding partner for analyte (or a fragment thereof) selected from the group consisting of an antibody, a fragment of an antibody that can bind to an analyte, a variant of an antibody that can bind to an analyte, a fragment of a variant of an antibody that can bind to an analyte, and a DVD-Ig (or a fragment, a variant, or a fragment of a variant thereof) and simultaneously or sequentially, in either order, contacting the test sample with at least one second specific binding partner, which can compete with analyte (or a fragment thereof) for binding to the at least one first specific binding partner and which is selected from the group consisting of a detectably labeled analyte, a detectably labeled fragment of analyte that can bind to the first specific binding partner, a detectably labeled variant of analyte that can bind to the first specific binding partner, and a detectably labeled fragment of a variant of analyte that can bind to the first specific binding partner. Any analyte (or a fragment thereof) present in the test sample and the at least one second specific binding partner compete with each other to form a first specific binding partner/analyte (or fragment thereof) complex and a first specific binding partner/second specific binding partner complex, respectively. The method further comprises determining the presence, amount or concentration of analyte in the test sample by detecting or measuring the signal generated by the detectable label in the first specific binding partner/second specific binding partner complex formed in (ii), wherein the signal generated by the detectable label in the first specific binding \n\n partner/second specific binding partner complex is inversely proportional to the amount or concentration of analyte in the test sample.\n\n\nThe above methods can further comprise diagnosing, prognosticating, or assessing the efficacy of a therapeutic/prophylactic treatment of a patient from whom the test sample was obtained. If the method further comprises assessing the efficacy of a therapeutic/prophylactic treatment of the patient from whom the test sample was obtained, the method optionally further comprises modifying the therapeutic/prophylactic treatment of the patient as needed to improve efficacy. The method can be adapted for use in an automated system or a semi-automated system.\n\n\nWith regard to the methods of assay (and kit therefor), it may be possible to employ commercially available anti-analyte antibodies or methods for production of anti-analyte as described in the literature. Commercial supplies of various antibodies include, but are not limited to, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), Gen Way Biotech, Inc. (San Diego, CA), and R&D Systems (RDS; Minneapolis, MN).\n\n\nGenerally, a predetermined level can be employed as a benchmark against which to assess results obtained upon assaying a test sample for analyte or a fragment thereof, e.g., for detecting disease or risk of disease. Generally, in making such a comparison, the predetermined level is obtained by running a particular assay a sufficient number of times and under appropriate conditions such that a linkage or association of analyte presence, amount or concentration with a particular stage or endpoint of a disease, disorder or condition or with particular clinical indicia can be made. Typically, the predetermined level is obtained with assays of reference subjects (or populations of subjects). The analyte measured can include fragments thereof, degradation products thereof, and/or enzymatic cleavage products thereof.\n\n\nIn particular, with respect to a predetermined level as employed for monitoring disease progression and/or treatment, the amount or concentration of analyte or a fragment thereof may be \"unchanged,\" \"favorable\" (or \"favorably altered\"), or \"unfavorable\" (or \"unfavorably altered\"). \"Elevated\" or \"increased\" refers to an amount or a concentration in a test sample that is higher than a typical or normal level or range (e.g., predetermined level), or is higher than another reference level or range (e.g., earlier or baseline sample). The term \"lowered\" or \"reduced\" refers to an amount or a concentration in a test sample that is lower than a typical or normal level or range (e.g., predetermined level), or is lower than another reference level or range (e.g., earlier or baseline sample). The term \"altered\" refers to an amount or a concentration in a sample that is altered (increased or decreased) over a typical or normal level or range (e.g., predetermined level), or over another reference level or range (e.g., earlier or baseline sample). \n\n The typical or normal level or range for analyte is defined in accordance with standard practice. Because the levels of analyte in some instances will be very low, a so-called altered level or alteration can be considered to have occurred when there is any net change as compared to the typical or normal level or range, or reference level or range, that cannot be explained by experimental error or sample variation. Thus, the level measured in a particular sample will be compared with the level or range of levels determined in similar samples from a so-called normal subject. In this context, a \"normal subject\" is an individual with no detectable disease, for example, and a \"normal\" (sometimes termed \"control\") patient or population is/are one(s) that exhibit(s) no detectable disease, respectively, for example. Furthermore, given that analyte is not routinely found at a high level in the majority of the human population, a \"normal subject\" can be considered an individual with no substantial detectable increased or elevated amount or concentration of analyte, and a \"normal\" (sometimes termed \"control\") patient or population is/are one(s) that exhibit(s) no substantial detectable increased or elevated amount or concentration of analyte. An \"apparently normal subject\" is one in which analyte has not yet been or currently is being assessed. The level of an analyte is said to be \"elevated\" when the analyte is normally undetectable (e.g., the normal level is zero, or within a range of from about 25 to about 75 percentiles of normal populations), but is detected in a test sample, as well as when the analyte is present in the test sample at a higher than normal level. Thus, inter alia, the disclosure provides a method of screening for a subject having, or at risk of having, a particular disease, disorder, or condition. The method of assay can also involve the assay of other markers and the like.\n\n\nAccordingly, the methods described herein also can be used to determine whether or not a subject has or is at risk of developing a given disease, disorder or condition. Specifically, such a method can comprise the steps of:\n\n\n(a) determining the concentration or amount in a test sample from a subject of analyte (or a fragment thereof) (e.g., using the methods described herein, or methods known in the art); and\n\n\n(b) comparing the concentration or amount of analyte (or a fragment thereof) determined in step (a) with a predetermined level, wherein, if the concentration or amount of analyte determined in step (a) is favorable with respect to a predetermined level, then the subject is determined not to have or be at risk for a given disease, disorder or condition. However, if the concentration or amount of analyte determined in step (a) is unfavorable with respect to the predetermined level, then the subject is determined to have or be at risk for a given disease, disorder or condition. \n\n Additionally, provided herein is method of monitoring the progression of disease in a subject. Optimally the method comprising the steps of:\n\n\n(a) determining the concentration or amount in a test sample from a subject of analyte;\n\n\n(b) determining the concentration or amount in a later test sample from the subject of analyte; and\n\n\n(c) comparing the concentration or amount of analyte as determined in step (b) with the concentration or amount of analyte determined in step (a), wherein if the concentration or amount determined in step (b) is unchanged or is unfavorable when compared to the concentration or amount of analyte determined in step (a), then the disease in the subject is determined to have continued, progressed or worsened. By comparison, if the concentration or amount of analyte as determined in step (b) is favorable when compared to the concentration or amount of analyte as determined in step (a), then the disease in the subject is determined to have discontinued, regressed or improved.\n\n\nOptionally, the method further comprises comparing the concentration or amount of analyte as determined in step (b), for example, with a predetermined level. Further, optionally the method comprises treating the subject with one or more pharmaceutical compositions for a period of time if the comparison shows that the concentration or amount of analyte as determined in step (b), for example, is unfavorably altered with respect to the predetermined level.\n\n\nStill further, the methods can be used to monitor treatment in a subject receiving treatment with one or more pharmaceutical compositions. Specifically, such methods involve providing a first test sample from a subject before the subject has been administered one or more pharmaceutical compositions. Next, the concentration or amount in a first test sample from a subject of analyte is determined (e.g., using the methods described herein or as known in the art). After the concentration or amount of analyte is determined, optionally the concentration or amount of analyte is then compared with a predetermined level. If the concentration or amount of analyte as determined in the first test sample is lower than the predetermined level, then the subject is not treated with one or more pharmaceutical compositions. However, if the concentration or amount of analyte as determined in the first test sample is higher than the predetermined level, then the subject is treated with one or more pharmaceutical compositions for a period of time. The period of time that the subject is treated with the one or more pharmaceutical compositions can be determined by one skilled in the art (for example, the period of time can be from about seven (7) days to about two years, preferably from about fourteen (14) days to about one (1) year). \n\n During the course of treatment with the one or more pharmaceutical compositions, second and subsequent test samples are then obtained from the subject. The number of test samples and the time in which said test samples are obtained from the subject are not critical. For example, a second test sample could be obtained seven (7) days after the subject is first administered the one or more pharmaceutical compositions, a third test sample could be obtained two (2) weeks after the subject is first administered the one or more pharmaceutical compositions, a fourth test sample could be obtained three (3) weeks after the subject is first administered the one or more pharmaceutical compositions, a fifth test sample could be obtained four (4) weeks after the subject is first administered the one or more pharmaceutical compositions, etc.\n\n\nAfter each second or subsequent test sample is obtained from the subject, the concentration or amount of aiialyte is determined in the second or subsequent test sample is determined (e.g., using the methods described herein or as known in the art). The concentration or amount of analyte as determined in each of the second and subsequent test samples is then compared with the concentration or amount of analyte as determined in the first test sample (e.g., the test sample that was originally optionally compared to the predetermined level). If the concentration or amount of analyte as determined in step (c) is favorable when compared to the concentration or amount of analyte as determined in step (a), then the disease in the subject is determined to have discontinued, regressed or improved, and the subject should continue to be administered the one or pharmaceutical compositions of step (b). However, if the concentration or amount determined in step (c) is unchanged or is unfavorable when compared to the concentration or amount of analyte as determined in step (a), then the disease in the subject is determined to have continued, progressed or worsened, and the subject should be treated with a higher concentration of the one or more pharmaceutical compositions administered to the subject in step (b) or the subject should be treated with one or more phaπnaceutical compositions that are different from the one or more pharmaceutical compositions administered to the subject in step (b). Specifically, the subject can be treated with one or more pharmaceutical compositions that are different from the one or more pharmaceutical compositions that the subject had previously received to decrease or lower said subject's analyte level.\n\n\nGenerally, for assays in which repeat testing may be done (e.g., monitoring disease progression and/or response to treatment), a second or subsequent test sample is obtained at a period in time after the first test sample has been obtained from the subject. Specifically, a second test sample from the subject can be obtained minutes, hours, days, weeks or years after the first test sample has been obtained from the subject. For example, the second test sample can be obtained from the subject at a time period of about 1 minute, about 5 minutes, about 10 minutes, about 15 minutes, about 30 minutes, about 45 minutes, about 60 minutes, about 2 hours, about 3 \n\n hours, about 4 hours, about 5 hours, about 6 hours, about 7 hours, about 8 hours, about 9 hours, about 10 hours, about 11 hours, about 12 hours, about 13 hours, about 14 hours, about 15 hours, about 16 hours, about 17 hours, about 18 hours, about 19 hours, about 20 hours, about 21 hours, about 22 hours, about 23 hours, about 24 hours, about 2 days, about 3 days, about 4 days, about 5 days, about 6 days, about 7 days, about 2 weeks, about 3 weeks, about 4 weeks, about 5 weeks, about 6 weeks, about 7 weeks, about 8 weeks, about 9 weeks, about 10 weeks, about 11 weeks, about 12 weeks, about 13 weeks, about 14 weeks, about 15 weeks, about 16 weeks, about 17 weeks, about 18 weeks, about 19 weeks, about 20 weeks, about 21 weeks, about 22 weeks, about 23 weeks, about 24 weeks, about 25 weeks, about 26 weeks, about 27 weeks, about 28 weeks, about 29 weeks, about 30 weeks, about 31 weeks, about 32 weeks, about 33 weeks, about 34 weeks, about 35 weeks, about 36 weeks, about 37 weeks, about 38 weeks, about 39 weeks, about 40 weeks, about 41 weeks, about 42 weeks, about 43 weeks, about 44 weeks, about 45 weeks, about 46 weeks, about 47 weeks, about 48 weeks, about 49 weeks, about 50 weeks, about 51 weeks , about 52 weeks, about 1.5 years, about 2 years, about 2.5 years, about 3.0 years, about 3.5 years, about 4.0 years, about 4.5 years, about 5.0 years, about 5.5. years, about 6.0 years, about\n\n\n6.5 years, about 7.0 years, about 7.5 years, about 8.0 years, about 8.5 years, about 9.0 years, about 9.5 years or about 10.0 years after the first test sample from the subject is obtained.\n\n\nWhen used to monitor disease progression, the above assay can be used to monitor the progression of disease in subjects suffering from acute conditions. Acute conditions, also known as critical care conditions, refer to acute, life-threatening diseases or other critical medical conditions involving, for example, the cardiovascular system or excretory system. Typically, critical care conditions refer to those conditions requiring acute medical intervention in a hospital- based setting (including, but not limited to, the emergency room, intensive care unit, trauma center, or other emergent care setting) or administration by a paramedic or other field-based medical personnel. For critical care conditions, repeat monitoring is generally done within a shorter time frame, namely, minutes, hours or days (e.g., about 1 minute, about 5 minutes, about 10 minutes, about 15 minutes, about 30 minutes, about 45 minutes, about 60 minutes, about 2 hours, about 3 hours, about 4 hours, about 5 hours, about 6 hours, about 7 hours, about 8 hours, about 9 hours, about 10 hours, about 11 hours, about 12 hours, about 13 hours, about 14 hours, about 15 hours, about 16 hours, about 17 hours, about 18 hours, about 19 hours, about 20 hours, about 21 hours, about 22 hours, about 23 hours, about 24 hours, about 2 days, about 3 days, about 4 days, about 5 days, about 6 days or about 7 days), and the initial assay likewise is generally done within a shorter timeframe, e.g., about minutes, hours or days of the onset of the disease or condition. \n\n The assays also can be used to monitor the progression of disease in subjects suffering from chronic or non-acute conditions. Non-critical care or, non-acute conditions, refers to conditions other than acute, life-threatening disease or other critical medical conditions involving, for example, the cardiovascular system and/or excretory system. Typically, non-acute conditions include those of longer-term or chronic duration. For non-acute conditions, repeat monitoring generally is done with a longer timeframe, e.g., hours, days, weeks, months or years (e.g., about 1 hour, about 2 hours, about 3 hours, about 4 hours, about 5 hours, about 6 hours, about 7 hours, about 8 hours, about 9 hours, about 10 hours, about 11 hours, about 12 hours, about 13 hours, about 14 hours, about 15 hours, about 16 hours, about 17 hours, about 18 hours, about 19 hours, about 20 hours, about 21 hours, about 22 hours, about 23 hours, about 24 hours, about 2 days, about 3 days, about 4 days, about 5 days, about 6 days, about 7 days, about 2 weeks, about 3 weeks, about 4 weeks, about 5 weeks, about 6 weeks, about 7 weeks, about 8 weeks, about 9 weeks, about 10 weeks, about 11 weeks, about 12 weeks, about 13 weeks, about 14 weeks, about 15 weeks, about 16 weeks, about 17 weeks, about 18 weeks, about 19 weeks, about 20 weeks, about 21 weeks, about 22 weeks, about 23 weeks, about 24 weeks, about 25 weeks, about 26 weeks, about 27 weeks, about 28 weeks, about 29 weeks, about 30 weeks, about 31 weeks, about 32 weeks, about 33 weeks, about 34 weeks, about 35 weeks, about 36 weeks, about 37 weeks, about 38 weeks, about 39 weeks, about 40 weeks, about 41 weeks, about 42 weeks, about 43 weeks, about 44 weeks, about 45 weeks, about 46 weeks, about 47 weeks, about 48 weeks, about 49 weeks, about 50 weeks, about 51 weeks , about 52 weeks, about 1.5 years, about 2 years, about 2.5 years, about 3.0 years, about 3.5 years, about 4.0 years, about 4.5 years, about 5.0 years, about 5.5. years, about 6.0 years, about 6.5 years, about 7.0 years, about 7.5 years, about 8.0 years, about 8.5 years, about 9.0 years, about 9.5 years or about 10.0 years), and the initial assay likewise generally is done within a longer time frame, e.g., about hours, days, months or years of the onset of the disease or condition.\n\n\nFurthermore, the above assays can be performed using a first test sample obtained from a subject where the first test sample is obtained from one source, such as urine, serum or plasma. Optionally, the above assays can then be repeated using a second test sample obtained from the subject where the second test sample is obtained from another source. For example, if the first test sample was obtained from urine, the second test sample can be obtained from serum or plasma. The results obtained from the assays using the first test sample and the second test sample can be compared. The comparison can be used to assess the status of a disease or condition in the subject.\n\n\nMoreover, the present disclosure also relates to methods of determining whether a subject predisposed to or suffering from a given disease, disorder or condition will benefit from \n\n treatment. In particular, the disclosure relates to analyte companion diagnostic methods and products. Thus, the method of \"monitoring the treatment of disease in a subject\" as described herein further optimally also can encompass selecting or identifying candidates for therapy.\n\n\nThus, in particular embodiments, the disclosure also provides a method of determining whether a subject having, or at risk for, a given disease, disorder or condition is a candidate for therapy. Generally, the subject is one who has experienced some symptom of a given disease, disorder or condition or who has actually been diagnosed as having, or being at risk for, a given disease, disorder or condition, and/or who demonstrates an unfavorable concentration or amount of analyte or a fragment thereof, as described herein.\n\n\nThe method optionally comprises an assay as described herein, where analyte is assessed before and following treatment of a subject with one or more pharmaceutical compositions (e.g., particularly with a pharmaceutical related to a mechanism of action involving analyte), with immunosuppressive therapy, or by immunoabsorption therapy, or where analyte is assessed following such treatment and the concentration or the amount of analyte is compared against a predetermined level. An unfavorable concentration of amount of analyte observed following treatment confirms that the subject will not benefit from receiving further or continued treatment, whereas a favorable concentration or amount of analyte observed following treatment confirms that the subject will benefit from receiving further or continued treatment. This confirmation assists with management of clinical studies, and provision of improved patient care.\n\n\nIt goes without saying that, while certain embodiments herein are advantageous when employed to assess a given disease, disorder or condition as discussed herein, the assays and kits can be employed to assess analyte in other diseases, disorders and conditions. The method of assay can also involve the assay of other markers and the like.\n\n\nThe method of assay also can be used to identify a compound that ameliorates a given disease, disorder or condition. For example, a cell that expresses analyte can be contacted with a candidate compound. The level of expression of analyte in the cell contacted with the compound can be compared to that in a control cell using the method of assay described herein.\n\n\nII. Kit\n\n\nA kit for assaying a test sample for the presence, amount or concentration of an analyte (or a fragment thereof) in a test sample is also provided. The kit comprises at least one component for assaying the test sample for the analyte (or a fragment thereof) and instructions for assaying the test sample for the analyte (or a fragment thereof). The at least one component for assaying the test sample for the analyte (or a fragment thereof) can include a composition \n\n comprising an anti-analyte DVD-Ig (or a fragment, a variant, or a fragment of a variant thereof), which is optionally immobilized on a solid phase.\n\n\nThe kit can comprise at least one component for assaying the test sample for an analyte by immunoassay, e.g., chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay, and instructions for assaying the test sample for an analyte by immunoassay, e.g., chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. For example, the kit can comprise at least one specific binding partner for an analyte, such as an anti-analyte, monoclonal/poly clonal antibody (or a fragment thereof that can bind to the analyte, a variant thereof that can bind to the analyte, or a fragment of a variant that can bind to the analyte) or an anti-analyte DVD-Ig (or a fragment, a variant, or a fragment of a variant thereof), either of which can be detectably labeled. Alternatively or additionally, the kit can comprise detectably labeled analyte (or a fragment thereof that can bind to an anti-analyte, monoclonal/polyclonal antibody or an anti-analyte DVD-Ig (or a fragment, a variant, or a fragment of a variant thereof)), which can compete with any analyte in a test sample for binding to an anti-analyte, monoclonal/polyclonal antibody (or a fragment thereof that can bind to the analyte, a variant thereof that can bind to the analyte, or a fragment of a variant that can bind to the analyte) or an anti-analyte DVD-Ig (or a fragment, a variant, or a fragment of a variant thereof), either of which can be immobilized on a solid support. The kit can comprise a calibrator or control, e.g., isolated or purified analyte. The kit can comprise at least one container (e.g., tube, microtiter plates or strips, which can be already coated with a first specific binding partner, for example) for conducting the assay, and/or a buffer, such as an assay buffer or a wash buffer, either one of which can be provided as a concentrated solution, a substrate solution for the detectable label (e.g., an enzymatic label), or a stop solution. Preferably, the kit comprises all components, i.e., reagents, standards, buffers, diluents, etc., which are necessary to perform the assay. The instructions can be in paper form or computer-readable form, such as a disk, CD, DVD, or the like.\n\n\nAny antibodies, such as an anti-analyte antibody or an anti-analyte DVD-Ig, or tracer can incorporate a detectable label as described herein, such as a fluorophore, a radioactive moiety, an enzyme, a biotin/avidin label, a chromophore, a chemiluminescent label, or the like, or the kit can include reagents for carrying out detectable labeling. The antibodies, calibrators and/or controls can be provided in separate containers or pre-dispensed into an appropriate assay format, for example, into microtiter plates.\n\n\nOptionally, the kit includes quality control components (for example, sensitivity panels, calibrators, and positive controls). Preparation of quality control reagents is well-known in the art and is described on insert sheets for a variety of immunodiagnostic products. Sensitivity panel members optionally are used to establish assay performance characteristics, and further optionally \n\n are useful indicators of the integrity of the immunoassay kit reagents, and the standardization of assays.\n\n\nThe kit can also optionally include other reagents required to conduct a diagnostic assay or facilitate quality control evaluations, such as buffers, salts, enzymes, enzyme co-factors, enzyme substrates, detection reagents, and the like. Other components, such as buffers and solutions for the isolation and/or treatment of a test sample (e.g., pretreatment reagents), also can be included in the kit. The kit can additionally include one or more other controls. One or more of the components of the kit can be lyophilized, in which case the kit can further comprise reagents suitable for the reconstitution of the lyophilized components.\n\n\nThe various components of the kit optionally are provided in suitable containers as necessary, e.g., a microtiter plate. The kit can further include containers for holding or storing a sample (e.g., a container or cartridge for a urine sample). Where appropriate, the kit optionally also can contain reaction vessels, mixing vessels, and other components that facilitate the preparation of reagents or the test sample. The kit can also include one or more instruments for assisting with obtaining a test sample, such as a syringe, pipette, forceps, measured spoon, or the like.\n\n\nIf the detectable label is at least one acridinium compound, the kit can comprise at least one acridinium-9-carboxamide, at least one acridinium-9-carboxylate aryl ester, or any combination thereof. If the detectable label is at least one acridinium compound, the kit also can comprise a source of hydrogen peroxide, such as a buffer, a solution, and/or at least one basic solution. If desired, the kit can contain a solid phase, such as a magnetic particle, bead, test tube, microtiter plate, cuvette, membrane, scaffolding molecule, film, filter paper, disc or chip.\n\n\nIII. Adaptation of Kit and Method\n\n\nThe kit (or components thereof), as well as the method of determining the presence, amount or concentration of an analyte in a test sample by an assay, such as an immunoassay as described herein, can be adapted for use in a variety of automated and semi-automated systems (including those wherein the solid phase comprises a microparticle), as described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,089,424 and 5,006,309, and as commercially marketed, e.g., by Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL) as ARCHITECT®.\n\n\nSome of the differences between an automated or semi-automated system as compared to a non-automated system (e.g., ELISA) include the substrate to which the first specific binding partner (e.g., an anti-analyte, monoclonal/polyclonal antibody (or a fragment thereof, a variant thereof, or a fragment of a variant thereof) or an anti-analyte DVD-Ig (or a fragment thereof, a \n\n variant thereof, or a fragment of a variant thereof) is attached; either way, sandwich formation and analyte reactivity can be impacted), and the length and timing of the capture, detection and/or any optional wash steps. Whereas a non-automated format, such as an ELISA, may require a relatively longer incubation time with sample and capture reagent (e.g., about 2 hours), an automated or semi-automated format (e.g., ARCHITECT®, Abbott Laboratories) may have a relatively shorter incubation time (e.g., approximately 18 minutes for ARCHITECT®). Similarly, whereas a non-automated format, such as an ELISA, may incubate a detection antibody, such as the conjugate reagent, for a relatively longer incubation time (e.g., about 2 hours), an automated or semi-automated format (e.g., ARCHITECT®) may have a relatively shorter incubation time (e.g., approximately 4 minutes for the ARCHITECT®).\n\n\nOther platforms available from Abbott Laboratories include, but are not limited to, AxSYM®, IMx® (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,294,404, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety), PRISM®, EIA (bead), and Quantum™ II, as well as other platforms. Additionally, the assays, kits and kit components can be employed in other formats, for example, on electrochemical or other hand-held or point-of-care assay systems. The present disclosure is, for example, applicable to the commercial Abbott Point of Care (i-STAT®, Abbott Laboratories) electrochemical immunoassay system that performs sandwich immunoassays. Immunosensors and their methods of manufacture and operation in single-use test devices are described, for example in, U.S. Patent No. 5,063,081, U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2003/0170881, U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2004/0018577, U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2005/0054078, and U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No.\n\n\n2006/0160164, which are incorporated in their entireties by reference for their teachings regarding same.\n\n\nIn particular, with regard to the adaptation of an analyte assay to the I-STAT® system, the following configuration is preferred. A microfabricated silicon chip is manufactured with a pair of gold amperometric working electrodes and a silver-silver chloride reference electrode. On one of the working electrodes, polystyrene beads (0.2 mm diameter) with immobilized anti- analyte, monoclonal/polyclonal antibody (or a fragment thereof, a variant thereof, or a fragment of a variant thereof) or anti-analyte DVD-Ig (or a fragment thereof, a variant thereof, or a fragment of a variant thereof), are adhered to a polymer coating of patterned polyvinyl alcohol over the electrode. This chip is assembled into an I-STAT® cartridge with a fluidics format suitable for immunoassay. On a portion of the wall of the sample-holding chamber of the cartridge there is a layer comprising a specific binding partner for an analyte, such as an anti- analyte, monoclonal/polyclonal antibody (or a fragment thereof, a variant thereof, or a fragment of a variant thereof that can bind the analyte) or an anti-analyte DVD-Ig (or a fragment thereof, a variant thereof, or a fragment of a variant thereof that can bind the analyte), either of which can be \n\n detectably labeled. Within the fluid pouch of the cartridge is an aqueous reagent that includes p- aminophenol phosphate.\n\n\nIn operation, a sample suspected of containing an analyte is added to the holding chamber of the test cartridge, and the cartridge is inserted into the I-STAT® reader. After the specific binding partner for an analyte has dissolved into the sample, a pump element within the cartridge forces the sample into a conduit containing the chip. Here it is oscillated to promote formation of the sandwich. In the penultimate step of the assay, fluid is forced out of the pouch and into the conduit to wash the sample off the chip and into a waste chamber. In the final step of the assay, the alkaline phosphatase label reacts with p-aminophenol phosphate to cleave the phosphate group and permit the liberated p-aminophenol to be electrochemically oxidized at the working electrode. Based on the measured current, the reader is able to calculate the amount of analyte in the sample by means of an embedded algorithm and factory-determined calibration curve.\n\n\nIt further goes without saying that the methods and kits as described herein necessarily encompass other reagents and methods for carrying out the immunoassay. For instance, encompassed are various buffers such as are known in the art and/or which can be readily prepared or optimized to be employed, e.g., for washing, as a conjugate diluent, microparticle diluent, and/or as a calibrator diluent. An exemplary conjugate diluent is ARCHITECT® conjugate diluent employed in certain kits (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) and containing 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), a salt, a protein blocker, an antimicrobial agent, and a detergent. An exemplary calibrator diluent is ARCHITECT® human calibrator diluent employed in certain kits (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL), which comprises a buffer containing MES, other salt, a protein blocker, and an antimicrobial agent. Additionally, as described in U.S. Patent Application No. 61/142,048 filed December 31, 2008, improved signal generation may be obtained, e.g., in an I-Stat cartridge format, using a nucleic acid sequence linked to the signal antibody as a signal amplifier.\n\n\nIt will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that other suitable modifications and adaptations of the methods of the invention described herein are obvious and may be made using suitable equivalents without departing from the scope of the invention or the embodiments disclosed herein. Having now described the present invention in detail, the same will be more clearly understood by reference to the following examples, which are included for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting of the invention. \n\n EXEMPLIFICATION Example 1: Design, Construction, and Analysis of a DVD-Ig\n\n\nExample 1.1: Assays Used to Identify and Characterize Parent Antibodies and DVD-Ig\n\n\nThe following assays were used throughout the Examples to identify and characterize parent antibodies and DVD-Ig, unless otherwise stated.\n\n\nExample 1.1.1: Assays Used To Determine Binding and Affinity of Parent Antibodies and DVD-Ig for Their Target Antigen(s)\n\n\nExample 1.1.1.A: Direct Bind ELISA\n\n\nEnzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays to screen for antibodies that bind a desired target antigen were performed as follows. High bind ELISA plates (Corning Costar # 3369, Acton, MA) were coated with lOOμL/well of lOμg/ml of desired target antigen (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or desired target antigen extra-cellular domain / FC fusion protein (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or monoclonal mouse anti-polyHistidine antibody (R&D Systems # MAB050, Minneapolis, MN) in phosphate buffered saline (1OX PBS, Abbott Bioresearch Center, Media Prep# MPS-073, Worcester, MA) overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed four times with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20. Plates were blocked by the addition of 300 μL/well blocking solution (non-fat dry milk powder, various retail suppliers, diluted to 2% in PBS) for 1/2 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed four times after blocking with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20.\n\n\nAlternatively, one hundred microliters per well of 10 μg/ml of Histidine (His) tagged desired target antigen (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was added to ELISA plates coated with monoclonal mouse anti-polyHistidine antibody as described above and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Wells were washed four times with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20.\n\n\nOne hundred microliters of antibody or DVD-Ig preparations diluted in blocking solution as described above was added to the desired target antigen plate or desired target antigen / FC fusion plate or the anti-polyHistidine antibody / His tagged desired target antigen plate prepared as described above and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Wells were washed four times with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20. \n\n One hundred microliters of IOng/mL goat anti-human IgG -FC specific HRP conjugated antibody (Southern Biotech # 2040-05, Birmingham, AL) was added to each well of the desired target antigen plate or anti-polyHistidine antibody / Histidine tagged desired target antigen plate. Alternatively, one hundred microliters of 10 ng/mL goat anti-human IgG -kappa light chain specific HRP conjugated antibody (Southern Biotech # 2060-05 Birmingham, AL) was added to each well of the desired target antigen / FC fusion plate and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed 4 times with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20.\n\n\nOne hundred microliters of enhanced TMB solution (Neogen Corp. #308177, K Blue, Lexington, KY) was added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μL IN sulphuric acid. Plates were read spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450 nm.\n\n\nTable 3 contains a list of the antigens used in the Direct Bind Assay.\n\n\nTable 4 contains the binding data expressed as EC50 in nM for those antibodies and DVD-Ig constructs tested in the Direct Bind ELISA assay.\n\n\nIn the Direct Bind ELISA, binding was sometimes not observed, probably because the antibody binding site on the target antigen was either \"masked\" or the antigen is \"distorted\" when coated to the plastic surface. The inability of a DVD-Ig to bind its target may also be due to steric limitation imposed on DVD-Ig by the Direct Bind ELISA format. The parent antibodies and DVD-Igs that did not bind in the Direct Bind ELISA format bound to target antigen in other ELISA formats, such as FACS, Biacore or bioassay. Non-binding of a DVD-Ig was also restored by adjusting the linker length between the two variable domains of the DVD-Ig, as shown previously. Table 3: Antigens Used in Direct Bind ELISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/FC = Fc region fusion \n\n Table 4: Direct Binding ELISA of Parental Antibodies and DVD Constructs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding of all DVD constructs was maintained and comparable to parent antibodies. All N- terminal variable domains bound with a similar high affinity as the parent antibody as well as the C-terminal variable domains of DVD constructs DVD289, DVD291, DVD294 and DVD296.\n\n\nExample l.l.l.B: Aβ 1-42 ELISA\n\n\nELISA assays were performed to screen for antibodies that bind a desired target antigen as follows. Maxisorb NUNC Immuno plates were coated with lOOμL/well of lμg/ml of Aβ 1 -42 diluted in coating buffer overnight at 6°C. Plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20. Blocking solution was prepared by dissolving the blocking reagent for ELISA \n\n (Roche) in 100 mL water and then diluted further 1 :10 prior to use. Plates were blocked by the addition of 265 μL/well blocking solution for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were washed three times after blocking with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20.\n\n\nAntibody or DVD-Igs were diluted to 100 ng/μL in PBST + 0.5% BSA and serially diluted 1 :3. One hundred microliters of antibody or DVD-Ig preparations was added to the plate and incubated for 2 hour at room temperature. Wells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20.\n\n\nTwo hundred microliters of anti-human POD diluted 1 :5000 was added to each well of the plate and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20.\n\n\nOne hundred microliters of TMB solution was added to each well and incubated for 10 minutes. TMB solution was prepared by mixing 20 mL 100 mM natrium-acetate pH4.9 with 200 μL TMB solution (Roche #92817060) and 29.5 μL 3% H\n2\nO\n2.\n The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μL IN sulphuric acid. Plates were read spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450 nm.

Aβ 20-42 globulomer and PBS at 37°C was pre-warmed for 1 minute. High bind ELISA plates (Corning Costar #3369, Acton, MA) were coated with lOOμL/well of 2μg/ml of Aβ 20-42 globulomer diluted in PBS overnight at 4°C. Plates were blocked with 320 μL/well of 100% superblock PBS buffer (Thermo Scientific, #37515) and incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed three times after blocking with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20.\n\n\nAntibody or DVD-Igs were diluted to 2000 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL, 40 ng/mL, 8 ng/mL, 1.6 ng/mL and 0.32 ng/mL in 10% superblock in PBS. One hundred microliters of antibody or DVD-Ig preparations was added to the plate in triplicate and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Wells were washed five times with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20.\n\n\nOne hundred microliters of goat anti -human HRP conjugated antibody (Pierce #31412) diluted 1 :40,000 was added to each well of the plate and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed five times with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20.\n\n\nOne hundred microliters of TMB solution (Invitrogen-Zymed; #00-2023) was added to each well and incubated for 5 minutes. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μL 2N sulphuric acid. Plates were read spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450 nm. Results are shown in Table 6.\n\n\nTable 6: A3 20-42 ELISA of Parental Antibodies and DVD Constructs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding of all DVD constructs was maintained and was comparable to parent antibodies.\n\n\nExample l.l.l.D: Capture ELISA\n\n\nELISA plates (Nunc, MaxiSorp, Rochester, NY) are incubated overnight at 4\n0\nC with anti- human Fc antibody (5 μ g/ml in PBS, Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Plates are \n\n washed three times in washing buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20), and blocked for 1 hour at 25\n0\nC in blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA). Wells are washed three times, and serial dilutions of each antibody or DVD-Ig in PBS containing 0.1% BSA are added to the wells and incubated at 25\n0\nC for 1 hour. The wells are washed three times, and biotinylated antigen (2nM) is added to the plates and incubated for 1 hour at 25\n0\nC. The wells are washed three times and incubated for 1 hour at 25\n0\nC with streptavidin-HRP (KPL #474-3000, Gaithersburg, MD). The wells are washed three times, and 100 μ 1 of ULTRA-TMB ELISA (Pierce, Rockford, IL) is added per well. Following color development the reaction is stopped with IN HCL and absorbance at 45OnM is measured. Results are shown in Table 7.\n\n\nExample 1.1.1.E: Affinity Determination Using BIACORE Technology Table 7: Reagent Used in Biacore Analyses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nECD = Extracellular Domain /FC = antigen/IgG FC domain fusion protein\n\n\nBIACORE Methods:\n\n\nThe BIACORE assay (Biacore, Inc, Piscataway, NJ) determines the affinity of antibodies or DVD-Ig with kinetic measurements of on-rate and off-rate constants. Binding of antibodies or DVD-Ig to a target antigen (for example, a purified recombinant target antigen) is determined by surface plasmon resonance-based measurements with a Biacore® 1000 or 3000 instrument (Biacore® AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using running HBS-EP (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20) at 25° C. All chemicals are obtained from Biacore® AB (Uppsala, Sweden) or otherwise from a different source as described in the text. For example, approximately 5000 RU of goat anti-mouse IgG, (Fcγ), fragment specific polyclonal antibody (Pierce Biotechnology Inc, Rockford, IL) diluted in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) is directly immobilized across a CM5 research grade biosensor chip using a standard amine coupling kit according to manufacturer's instructions and procedures at 25 μg/ml. Unreacted moieties on the biosensor surface are blocked with ethanolamine. Modified carboxymethyl dextran surface in flowcell 2 and 4 is used as a reaction surface. Unmodified carboxymethyl dextran without goat anti-mouse IgG in flow cell 1 and 3 is used as the reference surface. For kinetic analysis, rate equations derived from the 1 :1 Langmuir binding model are fitted simultaneously to association and dissociation phases of all eight injections (using global fit analysis) with the use of \n\n Biaevaluation 4.0.1 software. Purified antibodies or DVD-Ig are diluted in HEPES-buffered saline for capture across goat anti-mouse IgG specific reaction surfaces. Antibodies or DVD-Ig to be captured as a ligand (25 μg/ml) are injected over reaction matrices at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The association and dissociation rate constants, k\non\n (M\n4\nS\n\"1\n) and k\noff\n (s\n\"1\n) are determined under a continuous flow rate of 25 μl/min. Rate constants are derived by making kinetic binding measurements at different antigen concentrations ranging from 10 - 200 nM. The equilibrium dissociation constant (M) of the reaction between antibodies or DVD-Igs and the target antigen is then calculated from the kinetic rate constants by the following formula: K\nD\n = k\nOff\n/k\non\n. Binding is recorded as a function of time and kinetic rate constants are calculated. In this assay, on-rates as fast as 10\n6\n M\n4\nS\n\"1\n and off-rates as slow as 10\n\"6\n s\n\"\n can be measured. Results are shown in Table 8.\n\n\nTable 8: BIACORE Analysis of Parental Antibodies and DVD Constructs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBinding of all DVD-Ig constructs characterized by Biacore technology was maintained and comparable to that of parent antibodies. All N-terminal variable domains bound with a similar high affinity as the parent antibody.\n\n\nExample 1.1.2: Assays Used To Determine the Functional Activity Of Parent Antibodies And DVD-Ig\n\n\nExample 1.1.2.A: Cytokine Bioassay\n\n\nThe ability of an anti-cytokine or an anti-growth factor parent antibody or DVD-Ig containing anti-cytokine or anti-growth factor sequences to inhibit or neutralize a target cytokine \n\n or growth factor bioactivity is analyzed by determining the inhibitory potential of the antibody or DVD-Ig. For example, the ability of an anti-IL-4 antibody to inhibit IL-4 mediated IgE production may be used. For example, human naive B cells are isolated from peripheral blood, respectively, buffy coats by Ficoll-paque density centrifugation, followed by magnetic separation with MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) specific for human slgD FITC labeled goat F(ab)2 antibodies followed by anti-FITC MACS beads. Magnetically sorted naive B cells are adjusted to 3 x 10\n5\n cells per ml in XVl 5 and plated out in 100 μl per well of 96-well plates in a 6 x 6 array in the center of the plate, surrounded by PBS filled wells during the 10 days of culture at 37° C in the presence of 5% CO\n2\n. One plate each is prepared per antibody to be tested, consisting of 3 wells each of un-induced and induced controls and quintuplicate repeats of antibody titrations starting at 7μg/ml and running in 3-fold dilution down to 29 ng/ml final concentrations added in 50μl four times concentrated pre-dilution. To induce IgE production, rhIL-4 at 20 ng/ml plus anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) at 0.5 μg/ml final concentrations in 50 μl each are added to each well, and IgE concentrations are determined at the end of the culture period by a standard sandwich ELISA method.\n\n\nExample 1.1.2.B: Cytokine Release Assay\n\n\nThe ability of a parent antibody or DVD-Ig to cause cytokine release is analyzed. Peripheral blood is withdrawn from three healthy donors by venipuncture into heparized vacutainer tubes. Whole blood is diluted 1 :5 with RPMI-1640 medium and placed in 24-well tissue culture plates at 0.5 mL per well. The anti-cytokine antibodies (e.g., anti-IL-4) are diluted into RPMI-1640 and placed in the plates at 0.5 mL/well to give final concentrations of 200, 100, 50, 10, and 1 μg/mL. The final dilution of whole blood in the culture plates is 1 :10. LPS and PHA are added to separate wells at 2 μg/mL and 5 μg/mL final concentration as a positive control for cytokine release. Polyclonal human IgG is used as negative control antibody. The experiment is performed in duplicate. Plates are incubated at 37°C at 5% CO\n2\n. Twenty-four hours later the contents of the wells are transferred into test tubes and spun for 5 minutes at 1200 rpm. Cell-free supernatants are collected and frozen for cytokine assays. Cells left over on the plates and in the tubes are lysed with 0.5 mL of lysis solution, and placed at -20\n0\nC and thawed. 0.5 mL of medium is added (to bring the volume to the same level as the cell-free supernatant samples) and the cell preparations are collected and frozen for cytokine assays. Cell-free supernatants and cell lysates are assayed for cytokine levels by ELISA, for example, for levels of IL-8, IL-6, IL-lβ, IL-IRA, or TNF-α. Example 1.1.2.C: Cytokine Cross-Reactivity Study\n\n\nThe ability of an anti-cytokine parent antibody or DVD-Ig directed to a cytokine(s) of interest to cross react with other cytokines is analyzed. Parent antibodies or DVD-Ig are immobilized on a Biacore biosensor matrix. An anti-human Fc mAb is covalently linked via free \n\n amine groups to the dextran matrix by first activating carboxyl groups on the matrix with 10OmM N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and 40OmM N-Ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC). Approximately 50μL of each antibody or DVD-Ig preparation at a concentration of 25μg/mL, diluted in sodium acetate, pH 4.5, is injected across the activated biosensor and free amines on the protein are bound directly to the activated carboxyl groups. Typically, 5000 Resonance Units (RU's) are immobilized. Unreacted matrix EDC-esters are deactivated by an injection of 1 M ethanolamine. A second flow cell is prepared as a reference standard by immobilizing human IgGl /K using the standard amine coupling kit. SPR measurements are performed using the CM biosensor chip. All antigens to be analyzed on the biosensor surface are diluted in HBS-EP running buffer containing 0.01 % P20.\n\n\nTo examine the cytokine binding specificity, excess cytokine of interest (10OnM, e.g., soluble recombinant human) is injected across the anti-cytokine parent antibody or DVD-Ig immobilized biosensor surface (5 minute contact time). Before injection of the cytokine of interest and immediately afterward, HBS-EP buffer alone flows through each flow cell. The net difference in the signals between the baseline and the point corresponding to approximately 30 seconds after completion of cytokine injection are taken to represent the final binding value. Again, the response is measured in Resonance Units. Biosensor matrices are regenerated using 1OmM HCl before injection of the next sample where a binding event is observed, otherwise running buffer was injected over the matrices. Human cytokines (e.g., IL-lα, IL-lβ, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-23, IL-27, TNF-α, TNF-β, and IFN-γ, for example) are also simultaneously injected over the immobilized mouse IgGl /K reference surface to record any nonspecific binding background. By preparing a reference and reaction surface, Biacore can automatically subtract the reference surface data from the reaction surface data in order to eliminate the majority of the refractive index change and injection noise. Thus, it is possible to ascertain the true binding response attributed to an anti-cytokine antibody or DVD-Ig binding reaction.\n\n\nWhen a cytokine of interest is injected across immobilized anti-cytokine antibody, significant binding is observed. 1 OmM HCl regeneration completely removes all non-covalently associated proteins. Examination of the sensorgram shows that immobilized anti-cytokine antibody or DVD-Ig binding to soluble cytokine is strong and robust. After confirming the expected result with the cytokine of interest, the panel of remaining recombinant human cytokines is tested, for each antibody or DVD-Ig separately. The amount of anti-cytokine antibody or DVD-Ig bound or unbound cytokine for each injection cycle is recorded. The results from three independent experiments are used to determine the specificity profile of each antibody or DVD- \n\n Ig. Antibodies or DVD-Ig with the expected binding to the cytokine of interest and no binding to any other cytokine are selected.\n\n\nExample 1.1.2. D: Tissue Cross Reactivity\n\n\nTissue cross reactivity studies are done in three stages, with the first stage including cryosections of 32 tissues, second stage including up to 38 tissues, and the 3\nrd\n stage including additional tissues from 3 unrelated adults as described below. Studies are done typically at two dose levels.\n\n\nStage 1: Cryosections (about 5 μm) of human tissues (32 tissues (typically: Adrenal Gland, Gastrointestinal Tract, Prostate, Bladder, Heart, Skeletal Muscle, Blood Cells, Kidney, Skin, Bone Marrow, Liver, Spinal Cord, Breast, Lung, Spleen, Cerebellum, Lymph Node, Testes, Cerebral Cortex, Ovary, Thymus, Colon, Pancreas, Thyroid, Endothelium, Parathyroid, Ureter, Eye, Pituitary, Uterus, Fallopian Tube and Placenta) from one human donor obtained at autopsy or biopsy) are fixed and dried on object glass. The peroxidase staining of tissue sections is performed, using the avidin-biotin system.\n\n\nStage 2: Cryosections (about 5 μm) of human tissues 38 tissues (including adrenal, blood, blood vessel, bone marrow, cerebellum, cerebrum, cervix, esophagus, eye, heart, kidney, large intestine, liver, lung, lymph node, breast mammary gland, ovary, oviduct, pancreas, parathyroid, peripheral nerve, pituitary, placenta, prostate, salivary gland, skin, small intestine, spinal cord, spleen, stomach, striated muscle, testis, thymus, thyroid, tonsil, ureter, urinary bladder, and uterus) from 3 unrelated adults obtained at autopsy or biopsy) are fixed and dried on object glass. The peroxidase staining of tissue sections is performed, using the avidin-biotin system.\n\n\nStage 3: Cryosections (about 5 μm) of cynomolgus monkey tissues (38 tissues (including adrenal, blood, blood vessel, bone marrow, cerebellum, cerebrum, cervix, esophagus, eye, heart, kidney, large intestine, liver, lung, lymph node, breast mammary gland, ovary, oviduct, pancreas, parathyroid, peripheral nerve, pituitary, placenta, prostate, salivary gland, skin, small intestine, spinal cord, spleen, stomach, striated muscle, testis, thymus, thyroid, tonsil, ureter, urinary bladder, and uterus) from 3 unrelated adult monkeys obtained at autopsy or biopsy) are fixed and dried on object glass. The peroxidase staining of tissue sections is performed, using the avidin- biotin system.\n\n\nThe antibody or DVD-Ig is incubated with the secondary biotinylated anti-human IgG and developed into immune complex. The immune complex at the final concentrations of 2 and 10 μg/mL of antibody or DVD-Ig is added onto tissue sections on object glass and then the tissue \n\n sections are reacted for 30 minutes with a avidin-biotin-peroxidase kit. Subsequently, DAB (3,3'- diaminobenzidine), a substrate for the peroxidase reaction, is applied for 4 minutes for tissue staining. Antigen-Sepharose beads are used as positive control tissue sections. Target antigen and human serum blocking studies serve as additional controls. The immune complex at the final concentrations of 2 and 10 μg/mL of antibody or DVD-Ig is pre-incubated with target antigen (final concentration of 100 μg/ml) or human serum (final concentration 10%) for 30 minutes, and then added onto the tissue sections on object glass and then the tissue sections are reacted for 30 minutes with a avidin-biotin-peroxidase kit. Subsequently, DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine), a substrate for the peroxidase reaction, is applied for 4 minutes for tissue staining.\n\n\nAny specific staining is judged to be either an expected (e.g., consistent with antigen expression) or unexpected reactivity based upon known expression of the target antigen in question. Any staining judged specific is scored for intensity and frequency. The tissue staining between stage 2 (human tissue) and stage 3 (cynomolgus monkey tissue) is either judged to be similar or different. Example 1.1.2.E: Inhibition of HUVEC Proliferation/Survival by VEGF Parent Antibody and DVD-Ig Constructs\n\n\nPrior to plating for the assay, normal human umbilical vascular endothelial cells or HUVEC (passage 2-6) are maintained in EBM-2 (Lonza-Clonetics, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with EGM -2 SingleQuots (Lonza-Clonetics, Walkersville, MD, #CC-4176). HUVEC cells are plated at 10,000 cells/well on collagen coated black 96-well plates in (1 OOμl)\n\n\nEMB-2 with 0.1% FBS in the absence of growth factors. The following day the media is replaced with 0.1% FBS in the absence of growth factors. The following day the media is replaced with lOOμl of EMB-2 (without growth factors or serum) and incubated for four hours prior to the addition of VEGF and antibodies/DVD-Igs. Anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies or DVD-Igs (at final concentrations of 67 nM, 6.7 nM and 0.67 nM) are diluted in EMB-2 with 0.1 % BSA and are pre-incubated with recombinant human VEGFi\n65\n (50ng/ml) for 1 hour at 25\n0\nC in 50μl. Antibody/D VD-Ig and VEGF mixtures are then added to the cells (50μl), and the plates were incubated at 37 \n0\nC in a humidified, 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere for 72 hours. Cell survival/proliferation is measured indirectly by assessing ATP levels using an ATPlite kit (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nExample 1.1.2. F: IL-lα/β Bioassay and Neutralization Assay\n\n\nMRC5 cells were plated at 1.5-2 x 10\n4\n cells per well in a 100 μL volume and incubated overnight at 37\n0\nC, 5% CO\n2\n. A 20 μg/mL working stock of antibody (4x concentrated) was prepared in complete MEM medium. An eight point serial dilution was performed (5 μg/mL- \n\n 0.0003 μg/mL) in complete MEM in Marsh dilution plates. Sixty-five μL /well of each antibody dilution was added in quadruplicate to a 96 well v-bottom (Costar# 3894) plate and 65 μL of a 200 pg/mL solution of IL-I α or IL-I β or 65 μL of a mixed solution containing a 50 pg/mL solution of both IL-I α and IL-l β was also added. Control wells received 65 μL 200 pg/ml of IL- lα or IL-lβ or 50 pg/mL mixed IL-lα/β (4x concentrated) plus 65 μL MEM media and media control wells received 130 μL of media. Following a lhour incubation, 100 μL of the Ab/Ag mixture was added to the MRC5 cells. All well volumes were equal to 200 μL. All plate reagents were then Ix concentrated. After a 16-20 hour incubation, the well contents (150 μL) were transferred into a 96-well round bottom plate (Costar# 3799) and placed in a -20\n0\nC freezer. The supernatants were tested for hIL-8 levels by using a human IL-8 ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or hIL-8 chemiluminescence kit (MDS). Neutralization potency was determined by calculating percent inhibition relative to the IL- lα, IL-l β, or the IL-lα/β alone control value. Results are shown in Table 9.\n\n\nTable 9: IL-13Neutralization Assay With IL-13 Parent Antibody and DVD-Ig Constructs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll DVD-Igs containing VDs from AB032 in either the N-terminal or C-terminal position showed neutralization in the MRC5 IL-lIα/β neutralization assay.\n\n\nExample 1.1.2.G: Neutralization of huTNFα L929 cells were grown to a semi-confluent density and harvested using 0.05% tryspin\n\n\n(Gibco#25300). The cells were washed with PBS, counted and resuspended at 1E6 cells/mL in assay media containing 4 μg/mL actinomycin D. The cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (Costar#3599) at a volume of 50 μL and 5E4 cells/well. The DVD-Ig™ and control IgG were diluted to a 4x concentration in assay media and serial 1 :3 dilutions were performed. The huTNFα was diluted to 400 pg/mL in assay media. Antibody sample (200 μL) was added to the huTNFα (200 μL) in a 1 :2 dilution scheme and allowed to incubate for 0.5 hour at room temperature. \n\n The DVD-Ig™ / huTNFα solution was added to the plated cells at 100 μL for a final concentration of 100 pg/mL huTNFα and 25 nM - 0.00014 nM DVD-Ig™. The plates were incubated for 20 hour at 37\n0\nC, 5 % CO\n2\n. To quantitate viability, 100 μL was removed from the wells and 10 μL of WST-I reagent (Roche cat# 11644807001) was added. Plates were incubated under assay conditions for 3.5 hours, centrifuged at 500 xg and 75 μL supernatant transferred to an ELISA plate (Costar cat#3369). The plates were read at OD 420-600 nm on a Spectromax 190 ELISA plate reader. The results are provided in Table 10.\n\n\nTable 10: HuTNFα Neutralization Assay With huTNFα Parent Antibody and DVD-Ig Constructs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll DVD-Igs containing VDs from ABOl 7 in either the N-terminal or C-terminal position showed neutralization in the TNFα neutralization assay.\n\n\nExample 1.1.2.H: IL-6 induced pSTAT3 Assay\n\n\nTF-I cells are cultured in DMEM with 2 mM 1-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 100 LVmL Pen/strep, 1.5g/L sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/L glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS, and 2 ng/mL GM-CSF. TF-I cells are plated at 1.5-2 x 10\n5\n cells per well in a 10 μL volume and incubated overnight at 37\n0\nC, 5% CO\n2\n in assay medium, (complete DMEM minus GM-CSF). Cells are plated into a 96 \n1\nA well white assay plate. A 500 μg/mL working stock of antibody (4x concentrated) is prepared in PBS. Antibodies and DVD-Igs are serial diluted 1 :5 in assay medium in Marsh dilution plates. Five uL /well of each antibody dilution is added in triplicate to the 96 \n1\nA well white assay plate containing the cells. Cells and antibodies or DVD-Igs are pre-incubated for 30 minutes on ice. IL-6 is prepared at lOμg/mL stock in endotoxin free D-PBS (0.1% BSA) and a working stock of 100 ng/mL (4x concentration) prepared with assay media. Five μL/well of the 100 ng/mL IL-6 is added to each well. Plates are incubated for 30 minutes at 37\n0\nC. Cells are lysed by adding 5μLof 5X cell lysis buffer to all wells and the plates are shaken for 10 minutes at \n\n room temperature. Plates are frozen at -20\n0\nC and the pSTAT3 SureFire Assay was run (Perkin Elmer).\n\n\nThe plate is thawed at room temperature and 30 μL/ well of Reaction Buffer plus Activation Buffer mix containing Alpha Screen Acceptor Beeds (40 parts reaction buffer, 10 parts activation buffer and 1 part acceptor beads) is added to each well. The plate is sealed with foil to protect it from light and is agitated gently for 2 hours at 37\n0\nC.

The plates are incubated at 37 \n0\nC in a humidified, 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere for 3 days. The number of live cells in each well is quantified using MTS reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI) to determine the percent of tumor growth inhibition. Wells without antibody treatment are used as controls of 0% inhibition whereas wells without cells are considered to show 100% inhibition.\n\n\nExample 1.1.2.J: Tumoricidal Effect of A Parent or DVD-Ig Antibody In Vitro\n\n\nParent antibodies or DVD-Ig that bind to target antigens on tumor cells may be analyzed for tumoricidal activity.

The plates are incubated at 37 \n0\nC in a humidified, 5% CO\n2\n atmosphere for 3 days. The number of live cells in each well is quantified using MTS reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI) to determine the percent of tumor growth inhibition. Wells without antibody treatment are used as controls of 0% inhibition whereas wells without cells were considered to show 100% inhibition.\n\n\nFor assessment of apoptosis, caspase-3 activation is determined by the following protocol: antibody-treated cells in 96 well plates are lysed in 120 μl of Ix lysis buffer (1.67mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 7mM KCl, 0.83mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.1 ImM EDTA, 0.1 ImM EGTA, 0.57% CHAPS,\n\n\nImM DTT, Ix protease inhibitor cocktail tablet; EDTA-free; Roche Pharmaceuticals, Nutley, NJ) at room temperature with shaking for 20 minutes. After cell lysis, 80 μl of a caspase-3 reaction buffer (48mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 252mM sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 4mM DTT, and 20 μM Ac-DEVD- AMC substrate; Biomol Research Labs, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) is added and the plates are \n\n incubated for 2 hours at 37\n0\nC. The plates are read on a 1420 VICTOR Multilabel Counter (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Downers Grove, IL) using the following settings: excitation= 360/40, emission= 460/40. An increase of fluorescence units from antibody-treated cells relative to the isotype antibody control -treated cells is indicative of apoptosis.

SCID female mice (Charles Rivers Labs, Wilmington, MA) at 19-25 grams are injected subcutaneously into the right flank with 1 x 10\n6\n human tumor cells (1 :1 matrigel) on study day O. Administration (IP, QD, 3x/ week) of human IgG control or DVD-Ig was-initiated after mice are size matched into groups of mice with mean tumor volumes of approximately 200 to 320 mm\n3\n.

Example 1.1.2.Q: Binding of Parent Receptor Antibody and DVD-Ig Constructs to the Surface of Human Tumor Cell Lines as Assessed by Flow Cytometry\n\n\nStable cell lines overexpressing cell-surface receptors or human tumor cell lines are harvested from tissue culture flasks and resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS) containing 1% fetal calf serum (DPBS/FCS). 1-5 xlO\n5\n cells are incubated with lOOμL antibodies or DVD-Igs (10ug/mL) in DPBS/FCS for 30-60 minutes on ice. Cells are washed twice and 50μl of goat anti-human IgG-phycoerythrin (1 :50 dilution in DPBS/BSA) (Southern Biotech Associates, Birmingham, AL cat#2040-09) is added.

Fluorescence was measured using a Becton Dickinson LSRII (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).\n\n\nExample 1.2: Generation Of Parent Monoclonal Antibodies to a Human Antigen of Interest\n\n\nParent mouse mAbs able to bind to and neutralize a human antigen of interest and a variant thereof are obtained as follows:\n\n\nExample 1.2.A: Immunization Of Mice With a Human Antigen of Interest\n\n\nTwenty micrograms of recombinant purified human antigen (e.g., IGF 1,2) mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant or Immunoeasy adjuvant (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) is injected subcutaneously into five 6-8 week-old Balb/C, five C57B/6 mice, and five AJ mice on Day 1. On days 24, 38, and 49, twenty micrograms of recombinant purified human antigen variant mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant or Immunoeasy adjuvant is injected subcutaneously into the same mice. On day 84 or day 112 or day 144, mice are injected intravenously with 1 μg recombinant purified human antigen of interest.\n\n\nExample 1.2.B: Generation of a Hybridoma\n\n\nSplenocytes obtained from the immunized mice described in Example 1.2. A are fused with SP2/O-Ag-14 cells at a ratio of 5:1 according to the established method described in Kohler, G. and Milstein (1975) Nature, 256:495 to generate hybridomas. Fusion products are plated in selection media containing azaserine and hypoxanthine in 96-well plates at a density of 2.5xlO\n6\n spleen cells per well. Seven to ten days post fusion, macroscopic hybridoma colonies are observed. Supernatant from each well containing hybridoma colonies is tested by ELISA for the \n\n presence of antibody to the antigen of interest (as described in Example 1.1.1. A). Supernatants displaying antigen-specific activity are then tested for activity (as described in the assays of Example 1.1.2), for example, the ability to neutralize the antigen of interest in a bioassay such as that described in Example 1.1.2.1).\n\n\nExample 1.2. C: Identification And Characterization Of Parent Monoclonal Antibodies to a Human Target Antigen of Interest\n\n\nExample 1.2.C.1: Analyzing Parent Monoclonal Antibody Neutralizing Activity\n\n\nHybridoma supernatants are assayed for the presence of parent antibodies that bind an antigen of interest, generated according to Examples 1.2.A and 1.2.B, and are also capable of binding a variant of the antigen of interest (\"antigen variant\"). Supernatants with antibodies positive in both assays are then tested for their antigen neutralization potency, for example, in the cytokine bioassay of Example 1.1.2.1. The hybridomas producing antibodies with IC\n50\n values in the bioassay less than 100OpM, in an embodiment, less than lOOpM are scaled up and cloned by limiting dilution. Hybridoma cells are expanded into media containing 10% low IgG fetal bovine serum (Hyclone #SH30151, Logan, UT). On average, 250 mL of each hybridoma supernatant (derived from a clonal population) is harvested, concentrated and purified by protein A affinity chromatography, as described in Harlow, E. and Lane, D. 1988 \"Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual\". The ability of purified inAbs to inhibit the activity of its target antigen is determined, for example, using the cytokine bioassay as described in Example 1.1.2.1.\n\n\nExample 1.2.C.2: Analyzing Parent Monoclonal Antibody Cross-Reactivity To Cynomolgus Target Antigen Of Interest\n\n\nTo determine whether the selected inAbs described herein recognize cynomolgus antigen of interest, BIACORE analysis is conducted as described herein (Example 1.1.1.G) using recombinant cynomolgus target antigen. In addition, neutralization potencies of inAbs against recombinant cynomolgus antigen of interest may also be measured in the cytokine bioassay (Example 1.1.2.1). MAbs with good cyno cross-reactivity (in an embodiment, within 5-fold of reactivity for human antigen) are selected for future characterization.\n\n\nExample 1.2.D: Determination Of The Amino Acid Sequence Of The Variable Region For Each Murine Anti-Human Monoclonal Antibody Isolation of the cDNAs, expression and characterization of the recombinant anti-human mouse inAbs is conducted as follows. For each amino acid sequence determination, approximately 1 x 10\n6\n hybridoma cells are isolated by centrifugation and processed to isolate total \n\n RNA with Trizol (Gibco BRL/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA.) following manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA is subjected to first strand DNA synthesis using the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) per the manufacturer's instructions. Oligo(dT) is used to prime first-strand synthesis to select for poly(A)+ RNA. The first-strand cDNA product is then amplified by PCR with primers designed for amplification of murine immunoglobulin variable regions (Ig-Primer Sets, Novagen, Madison, WI). PCR products are resolved on an agarose gel, excised, purified, and then subcloned with the TOPO Cloning kit into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transformed into TOPlO chemically competent E. coli (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Colony PCR is performed on the transformants to identify clones containing insert. Plasmid DNA is isolated from clones containing insert using a QIAprep\n\n\nMiniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Inserts in the plasmids are sequenced on both strands to determine the variable heavy or variable light chain DNA sequences using M 13 forward and M 13 reverse primers (Fermentas Life Sciences, Hanover MD). Variable heavy and variable light chain sequences of the mAbs are identified. In an embodiment, the selection criteria for a panel of lead mAbs for next step development (humanization) includes the following:\n\n\n■ The antibody does not contain any N-linked glycosylation sites (NXS), except from the standard one in CH2\n\n\n■ The antibody does not contain any extra cysteines in addition to the normal cysteines in every antibody ■ The antibody sequence is aligned with the closest human germline sequences for VH and\n\n\nVL and any unusual amino acids should be checked for occurrence in other natural human antibodies « N-terminal Glutamine (Q) is changed to Glutamic acid (E) if it does not affect the activity of the antibody. This will reduce heterogeneity due to cyclization of Q ■ Efficient signal sequence cleavage is confirmed by Mass Spectrophotometry. This can be done with COS cell or 293 cell material\n\n\n\" The protein sequence is checked for the risk of deamidation of Asn that could result in loss of activity\n\n\n■ The antibody has a low level of aggregation ■ The antibody has solubility >5-10 mg/ml (in research phase); >25 mg/ml\n\n\n■ The antibody has a normal size (5-6 nm) by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)\n\n\n■ The antibody has a low charge heterogeneity\n\n\n■ The antibody lacks cytokine release (see Example 1.1.2.B)\n\n\n■ The antibody has specificity for the intended cytokine (see Example 1.1.2.C) ■ The antibody lacks unexpected tissue cross reactivity (see Example 1.1.2.D) \n\n ■ The antibody has similarity between human and cynomolgus tissue cross reactivity (see Example 1.1.2.D)\n\n\nExample 1.2.2: Recombinant Humanized Parent Antibodies\n\n\nExample 1.2.2.1: Construction And Expression Of Recombinant Chimeric Anti Human Parent Antibodies\n\n\nThe DNA encoding the heavy chain constant region of murine anti-human parent mAbs is replaced by a cDNA fragment encoding the human IgGl constant region containing 2 hinge- region amino acid mutations by homologous recombination in bacteria. These mutations are a leucine to alanine change at position 234 (EU numbering) and a leucine to alanine change at position 235 (Lund et al., 1991, J. Immunol., 147:2657). The light chain constant region of each of these antibodies is replaced by a human kappa constant region. Full-length chimeric antibodies are transiently expressed in COS cells by co-transfection of chimeric heavy and light chain cDNAs ligated into the pBOS expression plasmid (Mizushima and Nagata, Nucleic Acids Research 1990, VoI 18, pg 5322). Cell supernatants containing recombinant chimeric antibody are purified by Protein A Sepharose chromatography and bound antibody is eluted by addition of acid buffer. Antibodies are neutralized and dialyzed into PBS.\n\n\nThe heavy chain cDNA encoding a chimeric mAb is co-transfected with its chimeric light chain cDNA (both ligated in the pBOS vector) into COS cells. Cell supernatant containing recombinant chimeric antibody is purified by Protein A Sepharose chromatography and bound antibody is eluted by addition of acid buffer. Antibodies are neutralized and dialyzed into PBS.\n\n\nThe purified chimeric anti-human parent mAbs are then tested for their ability to bind (by Biacore) and for functional activity, e.g., to inhibit the cytokine induced production of IgE as described in Examples 1.1.1.G and 1.1.2.B. Chimeric mAbs that maintain the activity of the parent hybridoma mAbs are selected for future development.\n\n\nExample 1.2.2.2: Construction And Expression Of Humanized Anti Human Parent Antibodies\n\n\nExample 1.2.2.2.A: Selection Of Human Antibody Frameworks\n\n\nEach murine variable heavy and variable light chain gene sequence is separately aligned against 44 human immunoglobulin germline variable heavy chain or 46 germline variable light chain sequences (derived from NCBI Ig Blast website at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/igblast/retrieveig.html.) using Vector NTI software. \n\n Humanization is based on amino acid sequence homology, CDR cluster analysis, frequency of use among expressed human antibodies, and available information on the crystal structures of human antibodies. Taking into account possible effects on antibody binding, VH- VL pairing, and other factors, murine residues are mutated to human residues where murine and human framework residues are different, with a few exceptions. Additional humanization strategies are designed based on an analysis of human germline antibody sequences, or a subgroup thereof, that possessed a high degree of homology, i.e., sequence similarity, to the actual amino acid sequence of the murine antibody variable regions.\n\n\nHomology modeling is used to identify residues unique to the murine antibody sequences that are predicted to be critical to the structure of the antibody combining site, the CDRs. Homology modeling is a computational method whereby approximate three dimensional coordinates are generated for a protein. The source of initial coordinates and guidance for their further refinement is a second protein, the reference protein, for which the three dimensional coordinates are known and the sequence of which is related to the sequence of the first protein. The relationship among the sequences of the two proteins is used to generate a correspondence between the reference protein and the protein for which coordinates are desired, the target protein. The primary sequences of the reference and target proteins are aligned with coordinates of identical portions of the two proteins transferred directly from the reference protein to the target protein. Coordinates for mismatched portions of the two proteins, e.g., from residue mutations, insertions, or deletions, are constructed from generic structural templates and energy refined to insure consistency with the already transferred model coordinates. This computational protein structure may be further refined or employed directly in modeling studies. The quality of the model structure is determined by the accuracy of the contention that the reference and target proteins are related and the precision with which the sequence alignment is constructed.\n\n\nFor the murine mAbs, a combination of BLAST searching and visual inspection is used to identify suitable reference structures. Sequence identity of 25% between the reference and target amino acid sequences is considered the minimum necessary to attempt a homology modeling exercise. Sequence alignments are constructed manually and model coordinates are generated with the program Jackal (see Petrey, D. et al. (2003) Proteins 53 (Suppl. 6): 430-435).\n\n\nThe primary sequences of the murine and human framework regions of the selected antibodies share significant identity. Residue positions that differ are candidates for inclusion of the murine residue in the humanized sequence in order to retain the observed binding potency of the murine antibody. A list of framework residues that differ between the human and murine sequences is constructed manually. Table 12 shows the framework sequences chosen for this study. \n\n Table 12: Sequence Of Human IgG Heavy Chain Constant Domain And Light Chain Constant Domain\n\n\n \n\n The likelihood that a given framework residue would impact the binding properties of the antibody depends on its proximity to the CDR residues. Therefore, using the model structures, the residues that differ between the murine and human sequences are ranked according to their distance from any atom in the CDRs. Those residues that fell within 4.5 A of any CDR atom are identified as most important and are recommended to be candidates for retention of the murine residue in the humanized antibody (i.e., back mutation).\n\n\nIn silico constructed humanized antibodies are constructed using oligonucleotides. For each variable region cDNA, 6 oligonucleotides of 60-80 nucleotides each are designed to overlap each other by 20 nucleotides at the 5' and/or 3' end of each oligonucleotide. In an annealing reaction, all 6 oligonulceotides are combined, boiled, and annealed in the presence of dNTPs. DNA polymerase I, Large (Klenow) fragment (New England Biolabs #M0210, Beverley, MA.) is added to fill-in the approximately 40bp gaps between the overlapping oligonucleotides. PCR is performed to amplify the entire variable region gene using two outermost primers containing overhanging sequences complementary to the multiple cloning site in a modified pBOS vector (Mizushima, S. and Nagata, S. (1990) Nucleic Acids Res. 18: 17). The PCR products derived from each cDNA assembly are separated on an agarose gel and the band corresponding to the predicted variable region cDNA size is excised and purified. The variable heavy region is \n\n inserted in- frame onto a cDNA fragment encoding the human IgGl constant region containing 2 hinge-region amino acid mutations by homologous recombination in bacteria. These mutations are a leucine to alanine change at position 234 (EU numbering) and a leucine to alanine change at position 235 (Lund et al. (1991) J. Immunol. 147:2657). The variable light chain region is inserted in- frame with the human kappa constant region by homologous recombination. Bacterial colonies are isolated and plasmid DNA extracted. cDNA inserts are sequenced in their entirety. Correct humanized heavy and light chains corresponding to each antibody are co-transfected into COS cells to transiently produce full-length humanized anti-human antibodies. Cell supernatants containing recombinant chimeric antibody are purified by Protein A Sepharose chromatography and bound antibody is eluted by addition of acid buffer. Antibodies are neutralized and dialyzed into PBS.\n\n\nExample 1.2.2.3: Characterization Of Humanized Antibodies\n\n\nThe ability of purified humanized antibodies to inhibit a functional activity is determined, e.g., using the cytokine bioassay as described in Examples 1.1.2.A. The binding affinities of the humanized antibodies to recombinant human antigen are determined using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore®) measurement as described in Example 1.1.1. B. The IC\n50\n values from the bioassays and the affinity of the humanized antibodies are ranked. The humanized mAbs that fully maintain the activity of the parent hybridoma mAbs are selected as candidates for future development. The top 2-3 most favorable humanized mAbs are further characterized.\n\n\nExample 1.2.2.3.A: Pharmacokinetic Analysis Of Humanized Antibodies\n\n\nPharmacokinetic studies are carried out in Sprague-Dawley rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Male and female rats and cynomolgus monkeys are dosed intravenously or subcutaneously with a single dose of 4mg/kg mAb and samples are analyzed using antigen capture ELISA, and pharmacokinetic parameters are determined by noncompartmeiital analysis. Briefly, ELISA plates are coated with goat anti-biotin antibody (5 mg/ml, 4°C, overnight), blocked with Superblock (Pierce), and incubated with biotinylated human antigen at 50 ng/ml in 10% Superblock TTBS at room temperature for 2 hours. Serum samples are serially diluted (0.5% serum, 10% Superblock in TTBS) and incubated on the plate for 30 minutes at room temperature. Detection is carried out with HRP-labeled goat anti human antibody and concentrations are determined with the help of standard curves using the four parameter logistic fit. Values for the pharmacokinetic parameters are determined by non-compartmental model using WinNonlin software (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA). Humanized mAbs with good pharmacokinetics profile (T 1/2 is 8-13 days or better, with low clearance and excellent bioavailability 50-100%) are selected. \n\n Example 1.2.2.3.B: Physicochemical And In Vitro Stability Analysis Of Humanized Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\nSize exclusion chromatography\n\n\nAntibodies are diluted to 2.5 mg/mL with water and 20 mL is analyzed on a Shimadzu HPLC system using a TSK gel G3000 SWXL column (Tosoh Bioscience, cat# k5539-05k). Samples are eluted from the column with 211 mM sodium sulfate, 92 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/minutes. The HPLC system operating conditions are the following:\n\n\nMobile phase: 211 mM Na\n2\nSO\n4\n, 92 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n*7H\n2\nO, pH 7.0\n\n\nGradient: Isocratic\n\n\nFlow rate: 0.3 mL/minute\n\n\nDetector wavelength : 280 nm\n\n\nAutosampler cooler temp:4°C\n\n\nColumn oven temperature: Ambient\n\n\nRun time: 50 minutes\n\n\nTable 13 contains purity data of parent antibodies and DVD-Ig constructs expressed as percent monomer (unaggregated protein of the expected molecular weight) as determined by the above protocol.\n\n\nTable 13: Purity of Parent Antibodies and DVD-Ig Constructs as Determined by Size Exclusion Chromatography\n\n\n \n\n DVD-Igs showed an excellent SEC profile with most DVD-Ig showing >90% monomer. This DVD-Ig profile is similar to that observed for parent antibodies.\n\n\nSDS-PAGE\n\n\nAntibodies are analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\n\n\n(SDS-PAGE) under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. Adalimumab lot AFP04C is used as a control. For reducing conditions, the samples are mixed 1 : 1 with 2X tris glycine SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen, cat# LC2676, lot# 1323208) with 100 mM DTT, and heated at 60\n0\nC for 30 minutes. For non-reducing conditions, the samples are mixed 1 :1 with sample buffer and heated at 100\n0\nC for 5 minutes. The reduced samples (10 mg per lane) are loaded on a 12% precast tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen, cat# EC6005box, lot# 6111021), and the non-reduced samples (10 mg per lane) are loaded on an 8%-16% pre-cast tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen, cat# EC6045box, lot# 6111021). SeeBlue Plus 2 (Invitrogen, cat#LC5925, lot# 1351542) is used as a molecular weight marker. The gels are run in a XCeIl SureLock mini cell gel box (Invitrogen, cat# EIOOOl) and the proteins are separated by first applying a voltage of 75 to stack the samples in the gel, followed by a constant voltage of 125 until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. The running buffer used is IX tris glycine SDS buffer, prepared from a 1OX tris glycine SDS buffer (ABC, MPS-79-080106)). The gels are stained overnight with colloidal blue stain (Invitrogen cat# 46-7015, 46-7016) and destained with Milli-Q water until the background is clear. The stained gels are then scanned using an Epson Expression scanner (model 1680, S/N DASX003641).\n\n\nSedimentation Velocity Analysis\n\n\nAntibodies are loaded into the sample chamber of each of three standard two-sector carbon epon centerpieces. These centerpieces have a 1.2 cm optical path length and are built with sapphire windows. PBS is used for a reference buffer and each chamber contained 140 μL. All samples are examined simultaneously using a 4-hole (AN-60Ti) rotor in a Beckman ProteomeLab XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (serial # PL106C01).\n\n\nRun conditions are programmed and centrifuge control is performed using ProteomeLab (v5.6). The samples and rotor are allowed to thermally equilibrate for one hour prior to analysis (20.0 ± 0.1 \n0\nC). Confirmation of proper cell loading is performed at 3000 rpm and a single scan is recorded for each cell. The sedimentation velocity conditions are the following:\n\n\nSample Cell Volume: 420 mL Reference Cell Volume: 420 mL \n\n Temperature: 20\n0\nC Rotor Speed: 35,000 rpm Time: 8:00 hours UV Wavelength: 280 nm Radial Step Size: 0.003 cm\n\n\nData Collection: One data point per step without signal averaging. Total Number of Scans: 100\n\n\nLC-MS molecular weight measurement of intact antibodies\n\n\nMolecular weight of intact antibodies are analyzed by LC-MS. Each antibody is diluted to approximately 1 mg/mL with water. An 1100 HPLC (Agilent) system with a protein microtrap (Michrom Bioresources, Inc, cat# 004/25109/03) is used to desalt and introduce 5 mg of the sample into an API Qstar pulsar i mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). A short gradient is used to elute the samples. The gradient is run with mobile phase A (0.08% FA, 0.02% TFA in HPLC water) and mobile phase B (0.08% FA and 0.02% TFA in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 50 mL/minute. The mass spectrometer is operated at 4.5 kvolts spray voltage with a scan range from 2000 to 3500 mass to charge ratio.\n\n\nLC-MS molecular weight measurement of antibody light and heavy chains\n\n\nMolecular weight measurement of antibody light chain (LC), heavy chain (HC) and deglycosylated HC are analyzed by LC-MS. Aantibody is diluted to 1 mg/mL with water and the sample is reduced to LC and HC with a final concentration of 10 mM DTT for 30 minutes at\n\n\n37°C. To deglycosylate the antibody, 100 mg of the antibody is incubated with 2 mL of PNGase F, 5 mL of 10% N-octylglucoside in a total volume of 100 mL overnight at 37 \n0\nC. After deglycosylation the sample is reduced with a final concentration of 10 mM DTT for 30 minutes at 37°C. An Agilent 1100 HPLC system with a C4 column (Vydac, cat# 214TP5115, S/N 060206537204069) is used to desalt and introduce the sample (5 mg) into an API Qstar pulsar i mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). A short gradient is used to elute the sample. The gradient is run with mobile phase A (0.08% FA, 0.02% TFA in HPLC water) and mobile phase B (0.08% FA and 0.02% TFA in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 50 mL/minute. The mass spectrometer is operated at 4.5 kvolts spray voltage with a scan range from 800 to 3500 mass to charge ratio.\n\n\nPeptide mapping\n\n\nAntibody is denatured for 15 minutes at room temperature with a final concentration of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride in 75 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The denatured samples are \n\n reduced with a final concentration of 10 mM DTT at 37°C for 60 minutes, followed by alkylation with 50 mM iodoacetic acid (IAA) in the dark at 37°C for 30 minutes. Following alkylation, the sample is dialyzed overnight against four liters of 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 4°C. The dialyzed sample is diluted to 1 mg/mL with 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8 and 100 mg of antibody is either digested with trypsin (Promega, cat# V5111) or Lys-C (Roche, cat# 11 047 825 001) at a 1 :20 (w/w) trypsin/Lys-C:antibody ratio at 37°C for 4 hrs. Digests are quenched with 1 mL of 1 N HCl. For peptide mapping with mass spectrometer detection, 40 mL of the digests are separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RPHPLC) on a C18 column (Vydac, cat# 218TP51, S/N NE9606 10.3.5) with an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. The peptide separation is run with a gradient using mobile phase A (0.02% TFA and 0.08% FA in HPLC grade water) and mobile phase B (0.02% TFA and 0.08% FA in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 50 mL/minutes. The API QSTAR Pulsar i mass spectromer is operated in positive mode at 4.5 kvolts spray voltage and a scan range from 800 to 2500 mass to charge ratio.\n\n\nDisulfide Bond Mapping\n\n\nTo denature the antibody, 100 mL of the antibody is mixed with 300 mL of 8 M guanidine HCl in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The pH is checked to ensure that it is between 7 and 8 and the samples are denatured for 15 minutes at room temperature in a final concentration of 6 M guanidine HCl. A portion of the denatured sample (100 mL) is diluted to 600 mL with Milli-Q water to give a final guanidine -HCl concentration of 1 M. The sample (220 mg) is digested with either trypsin (Promega, cat # V5111, lot# 22265901) or Lys-C (Roche, cat# 11047825001, lot# 12808000) at a 1 :50 trypsin or 1 :50 Lys-C: antibody (w/w) ratios (4.4 mg enzyme: 220 mg sample) at 37°C for approximately 16 hours. An additional 5 mg of trypsin or Lys-C is added to the samples and digestion is allowed to proceed for an additional 2 hours at 37°C. Digestions are stopped by adding 1 mL of TFA to each sample. Digested samples are separated by RPHPLC using a C18 column (Vydac, cat# 218TP51 S/N NE020630-4-1A) on an Agilent HPLC system. The separation is run with the same gradient used for peptide mapping using mobile phase A (0.02% TFA and 0.08% FA in HPLC grade water) and mobile phase B (0.02% TFA and 0.08% FA in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 50 mL/minute. The HPLC operating conditions are the same as those used for peptide mapping. The API QSTAR Pulsar i mass spectromer is operated in positive mode at 4.5 kvolts spray voltage and a scan range from 800 to 2500 mass-to-charge ratio. Disulfide bonds are assigned by matching the observed MWs of peptides with the predicted MWs of tryptic or Lys-C peptides linked by disulfide bonds.\n\n\nFree sulfhydryl determination \n\n The method used to quantify free cysteines in an antibody is based on the reaction of Ellman's reagent, 5,50- dithio-bis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), with sulfhydryl groups (SH) which gives rise to a characteristic chromophoric product, 5-thio-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (TNB). The reaction is illustrated in the formula:\n\n\nDTNB + RSH ® RS-TNB + TNB- + H+\n\n\nThe absorbance of the TNB- is measured at 412 nm using a Cary 50 spectrophotometer. An absorbance curve is plotted using dilutions of 2 mercaptoethanol (b-ME) as the free SH Standard and the concentrations of the free sulfhydryl groups in the protein are determined from absorbance at 412 nm of the sample.\n\n\nThe b-ME standard stock is prepared by a serial dilution of 14.2 M b-ME with HPLC grade water to a final concentration of 0.142 mM. Then standards in triplicate for each concentration are prepared. Antibody is concentrated to 10 mg/mL using an amicon ultra 10,000 MWCO centrifugal filter (Millipore, cat# UFC801096, lot# L3KN5251) and the buffer is changed to the formulation buffer used for adalimumab (5.57 mM sodium phosphate monobasic, 8.69 mM sodium phosphate dibasic, 106.69 mM NaCl, 1.07 mM sodium citrate, 6.45 mM citric acid, 66.68 mM mannitol, pH 5.2, 0.1% (w/v) Tween). The samples are mixed on a shaker at room temperature for 20 minutes. Then 180 mL of 100 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.1 is added to each sample and standard followed by the addition of 300 mL of 2 mM DTNB in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.1. After thorough mixing, the samples and standards are measured for absorption at 412 nm on a Cary 50 spectrophotometer. The standard curve is obtained by plotting the amount of free SH and OD\n4I2\n nm of the b-ME standards. Free SH content of samples are calculated based on this curve after subtraction of the blank.\n\n\nWeak Cation Exchange Chromatography\n\n\nAntibody is diluted to 1 mg/mL with 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. Charge heterogeneity is analyzed using a Shimadzu HPLC system with a WCX-10 ProPac analytical column (Dionex, cat# 054993, S/N 02722). The samples are loaded on the column in 80% mobile phase A (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.0) and 20% mobile phase B (10 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, pH 6.0) and eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/minute.\n\n\nOligosaccharide Profiling\n\n\nOligosaccharides released after PNGase F treatment of antibody are derivatized with 2- aminobenzamide (2-AB) labeling reagent. The fluorescent-labeled oligosaccharides are separated \n\n by normal phase high performance liquid chromatography (NPHPLC) and the different forms of oligosaccharides are characterized based on retention time comparison with known standards.\n\n\nThe antibody is first digested with PNGaseF to cleave N-linked oligosaccharides from the Fc portion of the heavy chain. The antibody (200 mg) is placed in a 500 mL Eppendorf tube along with 2 mL PNGase F and 3 mL of 10% N-octylglucoside. Phosphate buffered saline is added to bring the final volume to 60 mL. The sample is incubated overnight at 37\n0\nC in an Eppendorf thermomixer set at 700 RPM. Adalimumab lot AFP04C is also digested with PNGase F as a control.\n\n\nAfter PNGase F treatment, the samples are incubated at 95°C for 5 minutes in an Eppendorf thermomixer set at 750 RPM to precipitate out the proteins, then the samples are placed in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 2 minutes at 10,000 RPM to spin down the precipitated proteins. The supernatent containing the oligosaccharides are transferred to a 500 mL Eppendorf tube and dried in a speed-vac at 65°C.\n\n\nThe oligosaccharides are labeled with 2AB using a 2AB labeling kit purchased from Prozyme (cat# GKK-404, lot# 132026). The labeling reagent is prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Acetic acid (150 mL, provided in kit) is added to the DMSO vial (provided in kit) and mixed by pipeting the solution up and down several times. The acetic acid/DMSO mixture (100 mL) is transferred to a vial of 2-AB dye (just prior to use) and mixed until the dye is fully dissolved. The dye solution is then added to a vial of reductant (provided in kit) and mixed well (labeling reagent). The labeling reagent (5 mL) is added to each dried oligosaccharide sample vial, and mixed thoroughly. The reaction vials are placed in an Eppendorf thermomixer set at 65°C and 700-800 RPM for 2 hours of reaction.\n\n\nAfter the labeling reaction, the excess fluorescent dye is removed using GlycoClean S Cartridges from Prozyme (cat# GKI -4726). Prior to adding the samples, the cartridges are washed with 1 mL of milli-Q water followed with 5 ishes of 1 mL 30% acetic acid solution. Just prior to adding the samples, 1 mL of acetonitrile (Burdick and Jackson, cat# AHO 15 -4) is added to the cartridges.\n\n\nAfter all of the acetonitrile passed through the cartridge, the sample is spotted onto the center of the freshly washed disc and allowed to adsorb onto the disc for 10 minutes. The disc is washed with 1 mL of acetonitrile followed by five ishes of 1 mL of 96% acetonitrile. The cartridges are placed over a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and the 2-AB labeled oligosaccharides are eluted with 3 ishes (400 mL each ish) of milli Q water. \n\n The oligosaccharides are separated using a Glycosep N HPLC (cat# GKI-4728) column connected to a Shimadzu HPLC system. The Shimadzu HPLC system consisted of a system controller, degasser, binary pumps, autosampler with a sample cooler, and a fluorescent detector.\n\n\nStability at Elevated Temperatures\n\n\nThe buffer of antibody is either 5.57 mM sodium phosphate monobasic, 8.69 mM sodium phosphate dibasic, 106.69 mM NaCl, 1.07 mM sodium citrate, 6.45 mM citric acid, 66.68 mM mannitol, 0.1% (w/v) Tween, pH 5.2; or 10 mM histidine, 10 mM methionine, 4% mannitol, pH 5.9 using Amicon ultra centrifugal filters. The final concentration of the antibodies is adjusted to 2 mg/mL with the appropriate buffers. The antibody solutions are then filter sterized and 0.25 mL aliquots are prepared under sterile conditions. The aliquots are left at either -80\n0\nC, 5°C, 25°C, or 40\n0\nC for 1, 2 or 3 weeks. At the end of the incubation period, the samples are analyzed by size exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE.\n\n\nThe stability samples are analyzed by SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. The procedure used is the same as described herein. The gels are stained overnight with colloidal blue stain (Invitrogen cat# 46-7015, 46-7016) and destained with Milli-Q water until the background is clear. The stained gels are then scanned using an Epson Expression scanner (model 1680, S/N DASX003641). To obtain more sensitivity, the same gels are silver stained using silver staining kit (Owl Scientific) and the recommended procedures given by the manufacturer is used.\n\n\nExample 1.2.2.3. C: Efficacy Of A Humanized Monoclonal Antibody Bv Itself Or In Combination With Chemotherapy On The Growth Of Human Carcinoma Xenografts\n\n\nHuman cancer cells are grown in vitro to 99% viability, 85% confluence in tissue culture flasks. SCID female or male mice (Charles Rivers Labs) at 19-25 grams, are ear tagged and shaved. Mice are then inoculated subcutaneously into the right flank with 0.2 ml of 2 x 10\n6\n human tumor cells (1 :1 matrigel) on study day 0. Administration (IP, Q3D/ week) of vehicle (PBS), humanized antibody, and/or chemotherapy is initiated after mice are size matched into separate cages of mice with mean tumor volumes of approximately 150 to 200 mm\n3\n. The tumors are measured by a pair of calipers twice a week starting on approximately day 10 post inoculation and the tumor volumes calculated according to the formula V = L x W\n2\n/2 (V: volume, mm\n3\n; L: length, mm; W: width, mm). Reduction in tumor volume is seen in animals treated with mAb alone or in combination with chemotherapy relative to tumors in animals that received only vehicle or an isotype control mAb. \n\n Example 1.2.2.3. D: FACS Based Redirected Cytotoxicity (rCTL) Assay\n\n\nHuman CD3+ T cells were isolated from previously frozen isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by a negative selection enrichment column (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; Cat.#HTCC-525). T cells were stimulated for 4 days in flasks (vent cap, Corning, Acton, MA) coated with lOμg/mL anti-CD3 (OKT-3, eBioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA) and 2μg/mL anti-CD28 (CD28.2, eBioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA) in D-PBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and cultured in 30U/mL IL-2 (Roche) in complete RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with L-glutamine, 55mM β-ME, Pen/Strep, 10% FBS). T cells were then rested overnight in 30U/mL IL-2 before using in assay. DoHH2 or Raji target cells were labeled with PKH26 (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) according to manufacturer's instructions. RPMI 1640 media (no phenol, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing L-glutamine and 10% FBS (Hy clone, Logan, UT) was used throughout the rCTL assay. (See Dreier et al. (2002) Int J Cancer 100:690).\n\n\nEffector T cells (E) and targets (T) were plated at a final cell concentration of 10\n5\n and 10\n4\n cells/well in 96-well plates (Costar #3799, Acton, MA), respectively to give an E:T ratio of 10:1. DVD-Ig molecules were diluted to obtain concentration-dependent titration curves. After an overnight incubation cells are pelleted and washed with D-PBS once before resuspending in FACS buffer containing 0.1% BSA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 0.1% sodium azide and 0.5μg/mL propidium iodide (BD) in D-PBS. FACS data was collected on a FACS Canto II machine (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and analyzed in Flowjo (Treestar). The percent live targets in the DVD-Ig treated samples divided by the percent total targets (control, no treatment) was calculated to determine percent specific lysis. IC50s were calculated in Prism (Graphpad).\n\n\nA CD3 / CD20 DVD-Ig was tested for redirected toxicity and showed in vitro tumor killing with an IC50 = 325pM. The sequence of this CD3 / CD20 DVD-Ig was disclosed in US Patent Application Serial No. 20070071675.\n\n\nExample 1.4: Generation of a DVD-Ig\n\n\nDVD-Ig molecules capable of binding two antigens are constructed using two parent monoclonal antibodies, one against human antigen A, and the other against human antigen B, selected as described herein.\n\n\nExample 1.4.1: Generation Of A DVD-Ig Having Two Linker Lengths\n\n\nA constant region containing μl Fc with mutations at 234, and 235 to eliminate\n\n\nADCC/CDC effector functions is used. Four different anti-A/B DVD-Ig constructs are generated: 2 with short linker and 2 with long linker, each in two different domain orientations: V\nA\n-V\nB\n-C and \n\n V\nB\n-V\nA\n-C (see Table 14). The linker sequences, derived from the N-terminal sequence of human Cl/Ck or CHl domain, are as follows:\n\n\nFor DVDAB constructs: light chain (if anti-A has λ):Short linker: QPKAAP (SEQ ID NO: 15); Long linker: QPKAAPSVTLFPP (SEQ ID NO: 16) light chain (if anti-A has κ):Short linker: TVAAP (SEQ ID NO: 13); Long linker: TVAAPSVFIFPP (SEQ ID NO: 14) heavy chain (γl): Short linker: ASTKGP (SEQ ID NO: 21); Long linker: ASTKGPSVFPLAP (SEQ ID NO: 22) For DVDBA constructs : light chain (if anti-B has λ):Short linker: QPKAAP (SEQ ID NO: 15); Long linker: QPKAAPSVTLFPP (SEQ ID NO: 16) light chain (if anti-B has k): Short linker: TVAAP (SEQ ID NO: 13); Long linker: TVAAPSVFIFPP (SEQ ID NO: 14) heavy chain (γl): Short linker: ASTKGP (SEQ ID NO: 21); Long linker:\n\n\nASTKGPSVFPLAP (SEQ ID NO: 22)\n\n\nHeavy and light chain constructs are subcloned into the pBOS expression vector, and expressed in COS cells, followed by purification by Protein A chromatography. The purified materials are subjected to SDS-PAGE and SEC analysis.\n\n\nTable 14 describes the heavy chain and light chain constructs used to express each anti-\n\n\nA/B DVD-Ig protein.\n\n\nTable 14: Anti-A/B DVD-Ig Constructs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.4.2: Molecular cloning of DNA constructs for DVDABSL and DVDABLL\n\n\nTo generate heavy chain constructs DVDABHC-LL and DVDABHC-SL, VH domain of A antibody is PCR amplified using specific primers (3 ' primers contain short/long liner sequence for SL/LL constructs, respectively); meanwhile VH domain of B antibody is amplified using specific primers (5' primers contains short/long liner sequence for SL/LL constructs, \n\n respectively). Both PCR reactions are performed according to standard PCR techniques and procedures. The two PCR products are gel-purified, and used together as overlapping template for the subsequent overlapping PCR reaction. The overlapping PCR products are subcloned into Srf I and Sal I double digested pBOS-hCγl,z non-a mammalian expression vector (Abbott) by using standard homologous recombination approach.\n\n\nTo generate light chain constructs DVDABLC-LL and DVDABLC-SL, VL domain of A antibody is PCR amplified using specific primers (3 ' primers contain short/long liner sequence for SL/LL constructs, respectively); meanwhile VL domain of B antibody is amplified using specific primers (5 ' primers contains short/long liner sequence for SL/LL constructs, respectively). Both PCR reactions are performed according to standard PCR techniques and procedures. The two PCR products are gel-purified, and used together as overlapping template for the subsequent overlapping PCR reaction using standard PCR conditions. The overlapping PCR products are subcloned into Srf I and Not I double digested pBOS-hCk mammalian expression vector (Abbott) by using standard homologous recombination approach. Similar approach has been used to generate DVDBASL and DVDBALL as described below:\n\n\nExample 1.4.3: Molecular cloning of DNA constructs for DVDBASL and DVDBALL\n\n\nTo generate heavy chain constructs DVDBAHC-LL and DVDBAHC-SL, VH domain of antibody B is PCR amplified using specific primers (3' primers contain short/long liner sequence for SL/LL constructs, respectively); meanwhile VH domain of antibody A is amplified using specific primers (5' primers contains short/long liner sequence for SL/LL constructs, respectively). Both PCR reactions are performed according to standard PCR techniques and procedures. The two PCR products are gel-purified, and used together as overlapping template for the subsequent overlapping PCR reaction using standard PCR conditions. The overlapping PCR products are subcloned into Srf I and Sal I double digested pBOS-hCγl,z non-a mammalian expression vector (Abbott) by using standard homologous recombination approach.\n\n\nTo generate light chain constructs DVDBALC-LL and DVDBALC-SL, VL domain of antibody B is PCR amplified using specific primers (3' primers contain short/long liner sequence for SL/LL constructs, respectively); meanwhile VL domain of antibody A is amplified using specific primers (5 ' primers contains short/long liner sequence for SL/LL constructs, respectively). Both PCR reactions are performed according to standard PCR techniques and procedures. The two PCR products are gel-purified, and used together as overlapping template for the subsequent overlapping PCR reaction using standard PCR conditions. The overlapping PCR products are subcloned into Srf I and Not I double digested pBOS-hCk mammalian expression vector (Abbott) by using standard homologous recombination approach. \n\n Example 1.4.4: Construction and Expression of Additional DVD-Ig\n\n\nExample 1.4.4.1: Preparation of DVD-Ig vector constructs\n\n\nParent antibody amino acid sequences for specific antibodies, which recognize specific antigens or epitopes thereof, for incorporation into a DVD-Ig can be obtained by preparation of hybridomas as described above or can be obtained by sequencing known antibody proteins or nucleic acids. In addition, known sequences can be obtained from the literature. The sequences can be used to synthesize nucleic acids using standard DNA synthesis or amplification technologies and assembling the desired antibody fragments into expression vectors, using standard recombinant DNA technology, for expression in cells.\n\n\nFor example, nucleic acid codons were determined from amino acids sequences and oligonucleotide DNA was synthesized by Blue Heron Biotechnology, Inc. (www.blueheronbio . com) Bothell, WA USA. The oligonucleotides were assembled into 300- 2,000 base pair double-stranded DNA fragments, cloned into a plasmid vector and sequence- verified. Cloned fragments were assembled using an enzymatic process to yield the complete gene and subcloned into an expression vector.

Vl, derived from pJP183; pHybE-hCgl,z,non-a V2, was used for cloning of antibody and DVD heavy chains with a wildtype constant region. V2, derived from pJP191 ; pHybE-hCk V2, was used for cloning of antibody and DVD light chains with a kappa constant region. V3, derived from pJP192; pHybE-hCl V2, was used for cloning of antibody and DVDs light chains with a lambda constant region. V4, built with a lambda signal peptide and a kappa constant region, was used for cloning of DVD light chains with a lambda- kappa hybrid V domain. V5, built with a kappa signal peptide and a lambda constant region, was used for cloning of DVD light chains with a kappa-lambda hybrid V domain. V7, derived from pJP183; pHybE-hCgl,z,non-a V2, was used for cloning of antibody and DVD heavy chains with a (234,235 AA) mutant constant region.\n\n\nReferring to Table 15, a number of vectors were used in the cloning of the parent antibodies and DVD-Ig VH and VL chains. \n\n Table 15: Vectors Used to Clone Parent Antibodies and DVD-Igs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1.4.4.2: Transfection And Expression In 293 Cells\n\n\nThe DVD-Ig vector constructs are tranfected into 293 cells for production of DVD-Ig protein. The 293 transient transfection procedure used is a modification of the methods published in Durocher et al. (2002) Nucleic Acids Res. 30(2):E9 and Pham et al. (2005) Biotech. Bioengineering 90(3):332-44. Reagents that were used in the transfection included:\n\n\n• HEK 293-6E cells (human embryonic kidney cell line stably expressing EBNAl ; obtained from National Research Council Canada) cultured in disposable Erlenmeyer flasks in a humidified incubator set at 130 rpm, 37°C and 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n• Culture medium: FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium (Invitrogen 12338-018) plus 25 μg/mL Geneticin (G418) (Invitrogen 10131-027) and 0.1% Pluronic F-68 (Invitrogen 24040-032). \n\n • Transfection medium: FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium plus 10 mM HEPES (Invitrogen 15630-080).\n\n\n• Polyethylenimine (PEI) stock: 1 mg/mL sterile stock solution, pH 7.0, prepared with linear 25kDa PEI (Polysciences) and stored at less than -15°C.\n\n\n• Tryptone Feed Medium: 5% w/v sterile stock of Tryptone Nl (Organotechnie, 19554) in\n\n\nFreeStyle 293 Expression Medium.\n\n\nCell preparation for transfection: Approximately 2 - 4 hours prior to transfection, HEK 293-6E cells are harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in culture medium at a cell density of approximately 1 million viable cells per mL. For each transfection, 40 mL of the cell suspension is transferred into a disposable 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask and incubated for 2 - 4 hours.\n\n\nTransfection: The transfection medium and PEI stock are prewarmed to room temperature (RT). For each transfection, 25μg of plasmid DNA and 50μg of polyethylenimine (PEI) are combined in 5 mL of transfection medium and incubated for 15 - 20 minutes at RT to allow the DNA:PEI complexes to form. For the BR3-Ig transfections, 25μg of BR3-Ig plasmid is used per transfection. Each 5-mL DNA:PEI complex mixture is added to a 40-mL culture prepared previously and returned to the humidified incubator set at 130 rpm, 37°C and 5% CO\n2\n. After 20- 28 hours, 5 mL of Tryptone Feed Medium is added to each transfection and the cultures are continued for six days.\n\n\nTable 16 contains the yield data for parent antibodies or DVD-Ig constructs expressed as milligrams per liter in 293 cells.\n\n\nTable 16: Transient Expression in Yields of Parent Antibodies and DVD-Ig Constructs in 293 Cells\n\n\n \n \n\n All DVDs expressed well in 293 cells. DVDs could be easily purified over a protein A column. In most cases >5 mg/L purified DVD-Ig could be obtained easily from supernatants of 293 cells.\n\n\nExample 1.4.5: Characterization and Lead Selection of A/B DVD-Igs\n\n\nThe binding affinities of anti-A/B DVD-Igs are analyzed on Biacore against both protein\n\n\nA and protein B. The tetravalent property of the DVD-Ig is examined by multiple binding studies on Biacore. Meanwhile, the neutralization potency of the DVD-Igs for protein A and protein B are assessed by bioassays, respectively, as described herein. The DVD-Ig molecules that best retain the affinity and potency of the original parent mAbs are selected for in-depth physicochemical and bio-analytical (rat PK) characterizations as described herein for each mAb. Based on the collection of analyses, the final lead DVD-Ig is advanced into CHO stable cell line development, and the CHO-derived material is employed in stability, pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies in cynomolgus monkey, and pre formulation activities.\n\n\nExample 2: Generation and Characterization of Dual Variable Domain Immunoglobulins (DVD-Ig)\n\n\nDual variable domain immunoglobulins (DVD-Ig) using parent antibodies with known amino acid sequences were generated by synthesizing polynucleotide fragments encoding DVD- Ig variable heavy and DVD-Ig variable light chain sequences and cloning the fragments into a pHybC-D2 vector according to Example 1.4.4.1. The DVD-Ig contructs were cloned into and expressed in 293 cells as described in Example 1,4.4.2. The DVD-Ig protein was purified according to standard methods. Functional characteristics were determined according to the methods described in Example 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 as indicated.

Description\n\n\n\n\n ANTI-HUMAN I N TE RLE U Kl N -20 ANTIBODIES\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to antibodies against human interleukin-20 (IL20), including human monoclonal anti-IL20 antibodies, as well as methods of production, composi- tions, and use thereof.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION lnterleukin-19 (IL19), IL20, and interleukin-24 (IL24) are members of the interleukin- 10 (IL10) cytokine family. All three interleukins bind and signal through the IL20R1/IL20R2 heterodimeric receptor. IL20 and IL24 (but not IL19) are also ligands for the receptor com- plex composed of IL20R2 and IL22R1 (Parrish-Novak et al., J Biol Chem 2002; 277: 47517- 47523; Dumoutier et al., J Immunol 2001 ; 167:3545-3549). It has been proposed that IL19 and IL20, along with other IL10 family members, form a distinct subfamily of helical cytokines where at least IL19 and IL20 have similar three-dimensional structures (Chang et al., J Biol Chem 2003; 278: 3308-13). IL20 and its receptors are present in elevated levels in psoriatic lesions (Wei et al.,\n\n\nClin Immunol (2005) 117: 65-72; Rømer ef a/., J Invest Dermatol 2003; 121 , 1306-1311 ; Wang et al., J Invest Dermatol 2006; 126: 1590-1599; Otkjaer ef al., Br J Dermatol 2005; 153: 91 1-918) and in synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients (Hsu et al., Arthritis Rheum 2006; 54: 2722-2733; Kragstrup et al., Cytokine 2008; 41 : 16-2). Antagonizing IL20 activity using receptor fragments or monoclonal antibodies has therefore been described as a promising approach for treatment of various inflammatory conditions (e.g., WO9927103, WO0146261 , WO2003051384, WO2004085475, and WO2006086396). For example, polyclonal anti-IL20 antibodies were found to be therapeutically effective in a xenograft model of psoriasis (Stenderup et al., Br J Dermatol 2006; 154: 1 1-35, Abstract P-12; Stenderup et al. Br J Dermatol 2009; 160(2):284-96).\n\n\nAntigenic epitopes of human IL20 (hlL20), as well as rat or murine monoclonal antibodies binding hulL20, have also been described (e.g., WO2005052000, US20060142550, and WO2007081465). However, no antibodies suitable for patient treatment have so far been provided. The present invention addresses these and other needs in the art.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides anti-hlL20 monoclonal antibodies that can reduce IL20-mediated activation of IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor complexes in one or \n\n more species, including humans. Typically, the antibodies are fully human or humanized to minimize the risk for immune responses against the antibodies when administered to a patient. The invention also provides anti-hlL20 antibodies having improved solubility properties, making them capable of being formulated at high concentrations. As described herein, other antigen-binding molecules such as, e.g., antigen-binding antibody fragments, antibody derivatives, and multi-specific molecules, can be designed or derived from such antibodies.\n\n\nAntibodies binding a specific segment of the hlL20 molecule that corresponds to Helix E in IL19 are also provided. In one embodiment, the epitope of the antibody comprise one or more amino acid residues in the segment corresponding to D78-L93, optionally excluding D78, in mature hlL20 (SEQ ID NO:1 ), e.g., H79, R83, S85, N90, F92, L93, or any combination thereof.\n\n\nCertain anti-hlL20 antibodies of the invention may also compete with and/or bind to the same epitope or have the same binding interface on hlL20 as one or more of the specific human anti-hlL20 antibodies described herein, including 15D2 and 5B7. For example, in one embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are more capable of competing with 15D2 and/or 5B7 than with known anti-hlL20 antibodies.\n\n\nIn another aspect, antibodies of the invention comprise antigen-binding sequences that derive from one or more of the same human V, D, or J segments as 15D2 or 5B7. The antibodies may, for example, comprise one or more antigen-binding sequences that are iden- tical or substantially identical to 15D2 and/or 5B7 antigen-binding sequences described herein.\n\n\nIn other aspects, the invention provides for nucleic acids encoding antibodies of the invention, expression vectors comprising such nucleic acids, host cells comprising such nucleic acids, host cells producing antibodies of the invention, and methods of producing anti- hlL20 antibodies by culturing such host cells under appropriate conditions. Also provided for are antibody-binding fragments of such antibodies, and molecules comprising such antibodies or antigen-binding fragments, including engineered antibody fragments, antibody derivatives, bispecific antibodies and other multispecific molecules. Pharmaceutical compositions and kits or other articles that comprise such antibodies or molecules can also be prepared. Further provided for are methods of reducing or inhibiting IL20-mediated activation of\n\n\nIL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor complexes, and methods of treating or preventing autoimmune or inflammatory diseases or disorders, including, but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Sjogren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythe- matosus, lupus nephritis, or a combination thereof, using such antibodies. \n\n DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the amino acid sequence of mature hlL20 (A) (SEQ ID NO:1 ) and (B) an alignment of the precursor form of hlL20 (SEQ ID NO:2), human IL19 (SEQ ID NO:3), murine IL20 (SEQ ID NO:4), and cynomolgus IL20 (SEQ ID NO:5). In (A), the numbered residues correspond to Helix E in IL19, with bold residues representing the key epitope segment of 15D2 and 5B7. Bold underlined residues are the ones most important for 15D2 and 5B7 binding, while bold double-underlined residues were found to be critical for 15D2 and/or 5B7 binding. In (B), the underlined segment in hlL20 is the signal sequence, and other markings are the same as in (A). Figure 2 shows a model of hlL20 (using IL19 nomenclature), built using the Chemical Computing Group's Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software from the template 1 N1 F.pdb of hi L19. Using a hlL19/hll_20 sequence alignment and the helix assignments in 1 N1 F.pdb, the figure was generated using Corel Draw (Corel Corporation).\n\n\nFigure 3 shows analyses of 15D2 heavy-chain variable (VH) region (SEQ ID NO:6) (A), 5B7 VH region (SEQ ID NO:7) (B), and 15D2/5B7 light-chain variable (VL) region (SEQ ID NO:9) (C), and an alignment of the 15D2 and 5B7 VH regions along with a consensus sequence (SEQ ID NO:8) (D). Each antibody sequence is aligned with the corresponding germline sequences, showing the corresponding Kabat-numbering of each amino acid position. In each sequence, the corresponding complementarity-determining region (CDR) se- quences according to the Kabat scheme are shown in bold, underlined text. VH1_03, D3-10, and JH6 correspond to sequences comprising SEQ ID NOS:10, 12 and 14, respectively, and VKI_L18/JK4 correspond to sequences comprising SEQ ID NOS:15 and 17, respectively. The coding sequences of D3-10, JH6, and JK4 are provided in SEQ ID NOS: 11 , 13, and 16, respectively. Figure 4 shows an alignment of VH (A) and VL (B) region sequences of several human anti-IL20 antibodies of lgG4 isotype with the corresponding Kabat-numbering of each amino acid position. In each sequence, the corresponding CDR sequences according to the Kabat scheme are shown in bold, underlined text. (A) Heavy chain variable sequences for 2F6 (SEQ ID NO:18), C3 (SEQ ID NO:20), F18 (SEQ ID NO:22), F56 and F56/F18 (SEQ ID NO:23), 5B7 (SEQ ID NO:7), and 15D2 (SEQ ID NO:6), (B) Light chain variable sequences for 2F6 (SEQ ID NO:19), C3 (SEQ ID NO:21 ), F56_type 1 , 15D2, and 5B7 (SEQ ID NO:9), and F56_type 2 (SEQ ID NO:24).\n\n\nFigure 5 shows the ability of 15D2 to inhibit hlL20- (A), hlL19- (B), and hlL24- (C) induced proliferation of BaF-3 cells transfected with hlL20R1/hlL20R2 at three different cyto- kine concentrations. (A) A dose-dependent response was detected for inhibition of hlL20- \n\n induced proliferation. No inhibition of hll_19- (B) or hlL24- (C) induced proliferation was observed in 15D2-concentration range used (up to 66nM).\n\n\nFigure 6 shows the results of a primary peptide array of hlL20 against 15D2 (A) or 5B7 (B). The Y axis indicates the optical density (OD, a measure of fluorescence intensity). Note that not all peptides are present in figure, since some OD values were below detection limit. In (A), peptides corresponding to residues 69-86 (85), 73-90 (86), 77-94 (87), 81-98 (88), and 85-102 (89) of SEQ ID NO:1 are shown. Peptide 87 came out as the peptide with highest binding activity. In (B), peptides corresponding to residues 49-66 (19), 53-70 (20), 57-74 (21 ), 69-86 (24), 73-90 (25), and 77-94 (26) are shown. Figure 7 shows a secondary peptide array analysis of hlL20 against 15D2 (A) or\n\n\n5B7 (B). The antibodies were tested against constructs with truncations from the C- and N- terminal. The peptides were all acylated in order to avoid the positive charge arising from the N-terminal. In (A), peptides corresponding to Y74 to K96 → S86 and K84 of SEQ ID NO:1 (peptides 1-12, respectively) are shown on the left-hand column, and peptides corresponding to Q75 → I85 to K96 of SEQ ID NO:1 (peptides 13-24, respectively, where peptides 22 and 23 are identical) are shown in the right-hand column. In (B), peptides corresponding to Y74 to K96 → S86 and K84 of SEQ ID NO:1 (peptides 1-12, respectively) are shown on the left- hand column, and peptides corresponding to Q75 → S84 to K96 (peptides 13-24, respectively, where peptides 22 and 23 are identical) are shown in the right-hand column. Figure 8 shows an Ala-scan of the long epitope YQTPDHYTLRKISSLANSFLTIK, corresponding to residues Y74 to K96 of SEQ ID NO:1 , against (A) 15D2 and (B) 5B7. In (A), the peptides shown correspond to residues 78-96 of SEQ ID NO:1 with an alanine substitution at positions 78-96, peptides 40-61 , respectively. In (B), the peptides shown correspond to residues 78-96 of SEQ ID NO:1 with an alanine substitution at positions 78-96, peptides 1- 22, respectively.\n\n\nFigure 9 shows 15D2 neutralization of murine IL20 activation of murine IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor, as revealed by a luciferase assay. Murine IL20 receptor complex mlL20R1/mll_22R1 was transfected into BHK cells and stimulated with 10 nM murine IL20. Neutralization of stimulation was investigated using 1 microgram/ml, 10 microgram/ml or 50 microgram/ml of 15D2.\n\n\nFigure 10 shows 15D2 neutralization of cynomolgus IL20 activation of human IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 receptors (A) or cynomolgous IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 (B), as revealed by a luciferase assay.\n\n\nFigure 11 shows 15D2 neutralization of human IL20-mediated activation of human IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2, as revealed by a luciferase assay. \n\n Figure 12 shows that IL19 reverted the 15D2 blocking of IL20-induced proliferation, revealing that 15D2 bound the soluble form of IL20 and not the receptor-bound form, which would otherwise block access of I L 19 to the receptor.\n\n\nFigure 13 shows the primary sequence of hlL20 used in an amide hydro- gen/deuterium exchange (HX) - mass spectrometry (MS) study to determine the 15D2 binding interface. The primary hlL20 sequence (using mature Met-1 numbering, thus differing +1 from the corresponding residue in SEQ ID NO:1 ) is displayed above the HX analyzed peptides (shown as horizontal bars). Peptides showing similar exchange patterns both in the presence and absence of 15D2 are indicated by grey bars whereas peptides showing re- duced deuterium incorporation upon 15D2 binding are indicated by black bars.\n\n\nFigure 14 shows sub-localization of the deuterium label from individual peptides in the HX-MS study. (A) Close-up of region 60-93 of the IL20 primary structure. Peptides showing similar exchange patterns both in the presence and absence of 15D2 are coloured grey whereas peptides showing reduced deuterium incorporation upon 15D2 binding are coloured black. The numbers indicate the difference in deuterium level observed in the individual IL20 regions upon 15D2 binding. (B) The information from the peptides have been sub-localized to smaller residue stretches by simple subtraction assuming complete off-exchange of the N- terminus and first peptide bond amide. The deuterium level was then corrected for the labelling reaction only containing 91% deuterium and reported as percent of total residues.\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n\nUnless otherwise stated or contradicted by context, the terms \"IL20\" or \"IL-20\" refer to human interleukin-20 (hlL20), also known as Zcytol O, including its unprocessed precursor (UniProt Q9NYY1 ; SEQ ID NO:2), mature form (SEQ ID NO:1 , UniProt Q9NYY1 without the residues 1-24 signal sequence), and/or naturally occurring variants or orthologs thereof, such as, e.g., murine IL20 (mll_20) precursor (UniProt Q9JKV9; SEQ ID NO:4), or cynomolgous IL20 (clL20) precursor (SEQ ID NO:5), or mature forms thereof which lack the signal sequence corresponding to residues 1-24 in precursor hlL20 (SEQ ID NO:2).\n\n\nThe term \"antibody\" herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically includes full-length monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, and, unless otherwise stated or con- tradicted by context, antigen-binding fragments, antibody variants, and multispecific molecules thereof, so long as they exhibit the desired specificity and/or biological activity. Generally, a full-length antibody is a glycoprotein comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds, or an antigen binding portion thereof. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) \n\n and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1 , CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into re- gions of hypervariability, termed complementarily determining regions (abbreviated herein as CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1 , CDR1 , FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. Various techniques relevant to the production of antibodies are provided in, e.g.,\n\n\nHarlow and Lane, ANTIBODIES: A LABORATORY MANUAL, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., (1988).\n\n\nAn \"antigen-binding fragment\" of an antibody is a molecule that comprises a portion of a full-length antibody which is capable of detectably binding to the antigen. Antigen- binding fragments include multivalent molecules comprising one, two, three, or more antigen- binding portions of an antibody, and single-chain constructs wherein the VL and VH regions, or selected portions thereof, are joined by synthetic linkers or by recombinant methods to form a functional, antigen-binding molecule.\n\n\nThe terms \"antibody derivative\" and immunoconjugate\" are used interchangeably herein to denote molecules comprising a full-length antibody or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, wherein one or more amino acids are chemically modified, e.g., by alkylation, PEGy- lation, acylation, ester formation or amide formation or the like, e.g., for linking the antibody to a second molecule. Exemplary modifications include PEGylation, cysteine-PEGylation, biotinylation, radiolabelling, and conjugation with a second agent, such as a cytotoxic agent. A \"multispecific molecule\" comprises an antibody, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, which is associated with or linked to at least one other functional molecule (e.g. another peptide or protein such as another antibody or ligand for a receptor) to generate a molecule that binds to at least two different binding sites or target molecules. Exemplary multispecific molecules include bi-specific antibodies and antibodies linked to soluble receptor fragments or ligands.\n\n\nThe term \"human antibody\", as used herein, is intended to include antibodies having variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. Furthermore, if the antibody contains a constant region, the constant region also is derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. Collections of human germline sequences are available at, e.g., the NCBI website. The human antibod- \n\n ies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo). However, the term \"human antibody\", as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of an- other mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences.\n\n\nA \"humanized\" antibody is a human/non-human chimeric antibody that contains a minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hyper- variable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit, or non-human primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and function. In some instances, FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues (\"back-mutations\"). Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipi- ent antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR residues are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody can optionally also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see, e.g., Jones et al., Nature 321 :522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992), WO 92/02190, US Patent Application 20060073137, and US Patents 6,750,325, 6,632,927, 6,639,055, 6,548,640, 6,407,213, 6,180,370, 6,054,297, 5,929,212, 5,895,205, 5,886,152, 5,877,293, 5,869,619, 5,821 ,337, 5,821 ,123, 5,770,196, 5,777,085, 5,766,886, 5,714,350, 5,693,762, 5,693,761 , 5,530,101 , 5,585,089, and 5,225,539.\n\n\nThe term \"hypervariable region\" when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody that are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a \"complementarity-determining region\" or \"CDR\" (residues 24-34 (L1 ), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light-chain variable domain and 31-35 (H1 ), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy-chain variable domain; (Kabat et al. (1991 ) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242) and/or those residues from a \"hypervari- able loop\" (residues 26-32 (L1 ), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light-chain variable domain \n\n and 26-32 (H1 ), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy-chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk, J. MoI. Biol 1987;196:901-917) and/or the specificity-determining residues (SDRs), which are the residues that are most crucial in the antibody-antigen interaction (Kashmiri et al., Methods 2005;36:25-34). The SDRs can be determined using, e.g., 3D structural analy- sis of the antibody-antigen interaction or by mutational analysis using known techniques. Typically, the numbering of amino acid residues in this region is performed by the method described in Kabat et al., supra. Phrases such as \"Kabat position\", \"variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat\" and \"according to Kabat\" herein refer to this numbering system for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains. Using the Kabat numbering system, the actual linear amino acid sequence of a peptide may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of, or insertion into, a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example, a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert (residue 52a according to Kabat) after residue 52 of CDR H2 and inserted residues (e.g. residues 82a, 82b, and 82c, etc. according to Kabat) after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a \"standard\" Kabat numbered sequence (see Figures 3 and 4).\n\n\nA \"variant\" of a polypeptide refers to a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence that is substantially identical to a reference polypeptide, typically a native or \"parent\" polypep- tide. The polypeptide variant may possess one or more amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions at certain positions within the native amino acid sequence, but differs from the parent polypeptide in at least one respect.\n\n\nThe term \"epitope\" or \"antigenic determinant\" of an antibody is the part of a predetermined antigen to which the antibody binds, and usually consists of chemically active sur- face groupings of amino acids or sugar chains. The specific amino acids defining a protein epitope can be relatively few in number, and typically comprise the amino acids that are directly involved in binding to the antibody, though other amino acids that are not directly involved in binding to the antibody can nevertheless be blocked when the antibody binds. The amino acids in a protein epitope may be close to each other or widely dispersed along the length of antigen, being brought into the correct epitope conformation via folding. A \"conformational epitope\" refers to an epitope that depends on the predetermined antigen being correctly folded, while a \"linear epitope\" can also be recognized by the antibody when not correctly folded, e.g., in denatured form or in the form of a fragment comprising the epitope.\n\n\n\"Specific binding\" as used herein refers to the ability of an antibody to bind a prede- termined antigen, such as, e.g., IL20. Typically, the antibody binds with a dissociation con- \n\n stant (Kd) of 10\n\"8\n or less, and binds to the predetermined antigen with a Kd that is at least 2- fold less than its Kd for binding to a non-specific antigen (e.g., BSA) other than the predetermined antigen or a closely related molecule (e.g., an ortholog).\n\n\nThe term \"substantially identical\" in the context of two amino acid sequences means that the sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BEST-FIT using default gap weights, share at least about 50, at least about 60, at least about 70, at least about 80, at least about 90, at least about 95, at least about 98, or at least about 99 percent sequence identity.\n\n\n\"Corresponding\" amino acid positions in two substantially identical amino acid se- quences are those aligned by any of the protein analysis software referred to herein, typically using default parameters.\n\n\nA nucleic acid is \"operably linked\" when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a pre-sequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a pre-protein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome-binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, \"operably linked\" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.\n\n\nAn \"isolated\" molecule is a molecule that is the predominant species in the composition wherein it is found with respect to the class of molecules to which it belongs (i.e., it makes up at least about 50% of the type of molecule in the composition and typically will make up at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or more of the species of molecule, e.g., peptide, in the composition). Commonly, a composition of an antibody molecule will exhibit 98%, 98%, or 99% homogeneity for antibody molecules in the context of all present peptide species in the composition or at least with respect to substantially active peptide species in the context of proposed use.\n\n\nIn the context of the present invention, \"treatment\" or \"treating\" refers to preventing, alleviating, managing, curing or reducing one or more symptoms or clinically relevant manifestations of a disease or disorder, unless contradicted by context. For example, \"treatment\" of a patient in whom no symptoms or clinically relevant manifestations of a disease or disor- der have been identified is preventive or prophylactic therapy, whereas \"treatment\" of a pa- \n\n tient in whom symptoms or clinically relevant manifestations of a disease or disorder have been identified generally does not constitute preventive or prophylactic therapy.\n\n\nUnless otherwise expressly indicated or clearly contradicted by context, the term \"or\" herein is used in the inclusive sense of \"and/or.\" \"Activation\" of a receptor or receptor complex means an increased or decreased activity of any or all intracellular signal transduction elements associated with the receptor or receptor complex after binding of the ligand to the receptor or receptor complex under normal physiological or pathophysiological conditions, as compared to a control. In the case of the IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor complexes, receptor activation can be analyzed using, e.g., a luciferase assay similar to the one described in Example 9. \"Reducing activation\" of a receptor or receptor complex means that the activation of the receptor is reduced by at least about 10%, preferably at least about 20%, more preferably at least about 30%, most preferably at least about 50%, or more, in comparison to a control (e.g., the level of activation in the absence of antibody). Some assays for evaluating the antibodies or other antigen-binding molecules described herein employ one or more \"controls.\" A \"control\" may be a standard value retrieved from a text book; a value obtained by running the same assay in the absence of ligand (e.g., IL20), receptor (e.g., IL20R1/IL20R2 and/or IL22R1/IL20R2), or antibody; or in the presence of a non-specific molecule (e.g., a non-specific antibody); or some other reference value used in the art. In the case of a receptor activation assay testing, for example, the ability of an antibody to reduce activation of a receptor complex, a suitable control value can be obtained by running the assay in the absence of the antibody or in the presence of an antibody not specifically binding to the ligand, receptor complex, or other components involved in receptor activation.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides for human anti-IL20 antibodies suitable for pharmaceutical formulations, diagnostic uses, and therapeutic uses. As described in the Examples, a novel epitope was identified for two human anti-IL20 antibodies designated 15D2 and 5B7. Key epitope residues were mapped to a region of hlL20 that corresponds to Helix E in hlL19 (Chang ed a/., J Biol Chem 2003; 278: 3308-13). A predicted model of hlL20 using the hlL19 nomenclature is shown in Figure 1 , with Helix E corresponding to residues D78 to H 103 in the mature hlL20 sequence (SEQ ID NO:1 ). It was found that an antibody binding to the novel hlL20 epitope reduced hll_20-mediated activation of both the IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 receptors, and reduced IL20-mediated, but not IL19- or IL24-mediated, re- \n\n ceptor activation in a proliferation assay. The epitope was further found to exist in both native and denatured form of the hlL20 antigen, as well as in both murine and cynomolgous IL20. Both 15D2 and 5B7 were also soluble at concentrations of at least about 80 mg/ml, and were found to derive from the same set of human germline genes (Example 3 and Figure 3). The invention thus provides antibodies which combine one or more functional properties, one or more structural properties, and/or antibodies which combine one or more functional with one or more structural properties described in subsequent sections and the Examples.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention provides an antibody, such as a monoclonal human or humanized antibody, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, that specifically binds to hlL20, optionally also to one or more hlL20 orthologs, specifically reduces hlL20 mediated activation of both hlL20R1/hlL20R2 and hlL22R1/hlL20R2 receptor complexes and/or their orthologs, and/or has a high solubility. In one embodiment, the heavy or light chain variable region sequences of the antibody derive from one or more of the 15D2 and 5B7 germline and/or V, D, or J segments. In one embodiment, the CDR and/or variable sequences of antibodies of the invention are substantially identical to one or more antigen-binding sequence of 15D2 and/or 5B7. In one embodiment, the antibody interacts with one or more residues in the segment H79 to H103 in the hlL20 sequence (SEQ ID NO:1 ), and may, for example, bind to H79, R83, S85, N90, F91 , L92, or a combination thereof. The antibody may be in any form suitable for therapeutic applications, e.g., a full-length antibody or a fragment thereof.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides for an isolated anti-hlL20 antibody, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, comprising a heavy chain variable region that is derived from a set of human genes comprising VH1_03, D3-10, and JH6 genes.

In one embodiment, the antibody has properties (a) to (d). In one embodiment, the antibody has all of properties (a) to (e). In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment competes in binding to hlL20 with an antibody comprising a light-chain variable region comprising SEQ ID NO:9 and a heavy-chain variable region comprising SEQ ID NO:6 or SEQ ID NO:7. In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen- binding fragment binds to an epitope comprising at least one residue selected from H79- H103 of mature hlL20 (SEQ ID NO:1 ). In one embodiment, the epitope comprises at least one residue selected from H79-L93. In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment comprises a heavy chain variable region comprising CDR1 , CDR2, and CDR3 sequences comprising Kabat residues residues 31-35, 50-65, and 95-102, respectively, of SEQ ID NO:6 or SEQ ID NO:7.

In one embodiment, the antibody heavy and light chain variable sequences are substantially identical to the respective heavy and light chain variable sequences of 15D2 and/or 5B7, e.g., having a sequence identity of at least about 80%, at least about 90%, or at least about 95%. In a specific embodiment, the antibody is of the lgG4 isotype. In one aspect, the invention provides such human anti-hlL20 antibodies that are sufficiently soluble for use in pharmaceutical compositions.

Inflammatory or autoimmune disorders suitable for such uses include rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Sjogren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus nephritis, or a combination of any thereof, as well as co-morbidities associated with these diseases, with cardiovascular disease being a non-limiting example of said co-morbidities.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides for a method of recombinantly producing an anti-IL20 antibody or antigen-binding fragment, comprising culturing a host cell producing the antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention under suitable conditions, and recovering the antibody or antigen-binding fragment. The host cell typically comprises an expression vector comprising nucleic adic(s) encoding heavy and/or light chain sequences of antibodies or antigen-binding fragments of the invention.\n\n\nThe production, characterization, and use of antibodies, antigen-binding fragments, or other molecules specifically binding hlL20 and having some or all of these properties are described in more detail in the following sections.\n\n\nAnti-IL20 antibodies\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention are characterized by particular functional and/or structural features or properties of the antibodies. Assays to evaluate the functional activities of anti-IL20 antibodies are described in detail in separate sections and in the Examples, and structural properties such as, e.g., amino acid sequences, are described below.\n\n\nFunctional properties\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention bind specifically to hlL20. The antibody preferably binds to hlL20 with high affinity, for example with a KD of 10\n\"7\n M or less, a KD of 10\n\"8\n M or less, a KD of 1 nM or less, a KD of about 0.3 nM or less, or a KD of about 0.2 nM or less, or \n\n a KD of about 0.1 nM or less. A recombinantly produced anti-IL20 antibody in sodium acetate buffer may, for example, bind to recombinant hlL20 with an affinity of about 0.1 nM or less, optionally with an affinity of about 0.01-0.05 nM, in a Biacore assay (see, e.g., Example 12). Additionally, the antibodies may detectably bind to IL20 from one or more non-human mam- mals, including mouse {e.g, mus musculus) and/or cynomolgus monkey {Macaca fascicu- laris) (see, e.g., Example 2). Furthermore, the antibodies of the invention are capable of reducing IL20-mediated activation of IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor complexes in vitro and/or in vivo. This may be tested in one or more assays described herein (see, e.g., Examples 1 , 2, and 9-1 1 ) or known in the art. Using a suitable assay, an antibody of the in- vention can reduce hll_20-mediated activation of human IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor complexes by at least about 10%, more preferably by at least 20%, even more preferably by at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, or at least 60%, as compared to a control (e.g., in the absence of any anti-hlL20 antibody). The antibody may further be able to reduce IL20-mediated activation of IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor complexes in other species, such as mice and cynomolgous monkeys, using the corresponding ligand and receptor complex orthologues (see Example 9).\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention reduce IL20-mediated proliferation of BaF-3 cells recombinantly expressing IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2, but typically have no significant effect on IL19- and/or IL24-induced proliferation (see, e.g., Example 2). In such assays, an antibody of the invention typically reduces proliferation with an EC50 of about 50 μM or less, about 5 μM or less, about 1 μM or less, about 0.5 μM or less, about 0.1 μM or less, about 0.05 μM or less, or about 0.02 μM or less. For example, in a proliferation assay described in Example 10, recombinantly produced human antibody 15D2 had an EC50 of less than 0.02 μM. The anti-IL20 antibodies of the invention can inhibit hll_20-mediated receptor complex activation by any mechanism, or by a combination of different mechanisms. Typically, an anti-hlL20 antibody can reduce or prevent hlL20 binding to cell-associated hlL20 receptors or fully formed receptor complexes. Additionally or alternatively, antibodies of the invention may bind to cell-associated hlL20 single-chain receptor molecules, but prevent formation of the receptor complex. Additionally or alternatively, antibodies of the invention may bind to cell-associated hlL20 single-chain receptor molecules and fully formed receptor complexes, but reduce or inhibit structural changes necessary for receptor complex activation. Which one or more mechanisms are involved can be identified by, e.g., testing whether the antibody associates to cells expressing human IL20R1 , IL20R2, IL22R1 receptor molecules, or IL20R1/IL20R2 and/or IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor complexes in the presence of hlL20. In a \n\n specific embodiment, the antibody reduces the binding of hlL20 to hlL20R2. In another specific embodiment, the antibody does not reduce binding of hlL20 to at least one of the human IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor complexes. Particular antibodies of the invention bind a hlL20 epitope that at least partially overlaps, or includes at least one residue in, the segment corresponding to Helix E in IL19, optionally excluding D78. Without being limited to theory, this segment can comprise or be part of a helical structure in IL20 that is involved in binding to and/or activating IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2. For a model of hlL20 built using a hlL20-hll_19 sequence alignment and structural IL19 information, see Figure 2. In the hlL20 sequence, this segment comprises residues D78-H103 of mature hlL20 (SEQ ID NO:1 ). In one embodiment, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention thus binds to an epitope comprising at least one residue selected from D78-H103 of mature hlL20 (SEQ ID NO:1 ). In other specific and separate embodiments, the epitope includes 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more residues in the D78-H103 segment.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides an antibody binding an epitope comprising 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more residues in the segment corresponding to residues D78-K96 or H79-K96 in mature hlL20. This segment contains an epitope providing a higher affinity of anti-IL20 antibody 5B7. The antibody may alternatively bind an epitope comprising 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more residues in the segment corresponding to residues D78-L93 or H79-L93, which contains the key residues of the 15D2 epitope. For example, the antibody may bind an epitope comprising at least one residue selected from H79-L93. The antibody may alternatively bind an epitope comprising 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or more residues in the segment corresponding to residues H79-N90, which contains the key residues of the 5B7 epitope. In specific and separate embodiments, all key residues of the epitope is in a segment corresponding to residues D78-H103, D78-K96, D78-L93, or D78-N90, optionally excluding D78. In another aspect, the antibody binds an epitope comprising at least one of residues\n\n\nH79, R83, S85, N90, F91 , and L92 of mature IL20. In separate and specific embodiments, the antibody binds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or all of D78, H79, R83, S85, N90, F91 , and L92. In another embodiment, the epitope comprises at least residues H79 and N90. In an additional embodiment, the epitope further comprises residue R83. In yet another embodiment, the epi- tope further comprises 1 , 2, 3, or all of D78, S85, F91 , and L92.ln another aspect, the invention provides antibodies that compete with and/or bind to the same epitope on hlL20 as an antibody comprising the VH and VL sequences of either of 5B7 or 15D2, described below. Such antibodies thus compete in binding to hlL20 with an antibody comprising a light-chain variable region comprising SEQ ID NO:9 and a heavy-chain variable region comprising SEQ ID NO:6 or SEQ ID NO:7. Such antibodies can be identified based on their ability to compete \n\n with 15D2 and/or 5B7 in standard hlL20 binding assays as described herein (see, e.g., Example 4 or the section entitled \"Binding Assays\" below). The ability of a test antibody to reduce or inhibit the binding of 15D2 and/or 5B7 to hlL20 demonstrates that the test antibody can compete with 15D2 and/or 5B7 for binding to hlL20 and thus can bind to the same hlL20 segment or epitope as 5B7 and/or 15D2. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody that binds to the same segment or epitope of hlL20 as 5B7 and/or 15D2 is a human monoclonal antibody. Such human monoclonal antibodies can be prepared and isolated according to known methods in the art, as described herein.\n\n\nIn a particular embodiment, the antibody binds to a different hlL20 segment or epi- tope than those bound by any of the rat antibodies described in WO2005052000\n\n\n(262.4.1.2.2.1 , 262.5.1.6.4.4, and 262.7.1.3.2.4), and/or by murine antibodies (7E) described in US20060142550 and WO2007081465, and competes more with 15D2 and/or 5B7 in binding to hlL20 than with either of the listed mouse or rat antibodies. In another particular embodiment, the antibody is a human antibody which does not bind to the segment correspond- ding to residues 42-102 of the IL20 precursor (SEQ ID NO:2).\n\n\nAny combination of the above-described functional features, other functional features described in the Examples, and/or structural features describing in the following section, may be exhibited by an antibody of the invention. Structural properties In one aspect, the invention provides human anti-IL20 antibodies with suitable stability and/or solubility characteristics for being formulated in aqueous formulations at concentrations of at least about 50 mg/ml, at least about 60 mg/ml, at least about 70 mg/ml, at least about 80 mg/ml, at least about 90 mg/ml, or at least about 100 mg/ml, which aqueous formulation may further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent, or carrier, and typically has a pH near neutral or physiological pH. In one embodiment, the anti-IL20 antibody has a solubility of at least 80 mg/ml in an aqueous formulation, optionally comprising a 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer and 150 mM NaCI, and having a pH of about 7.4. In one embodiment, the anti-IL20 antibody has a solubility of at least 100 mg/ml in an aqueous formulation, optionally comprising a 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer and 150 mM NaCI, and having a pH of about 7.4. It has now been found that human anti-IL20 antibodies deriving from certain germline sequences are more soluble than others, thereby achieving higher concentrations in an aqueous solution (see, e.g., Example 3). Such embodiments are described in further detail below. \n\n Preferred antibodies of the invention include the human monoclonal antibodies 15D2 or 5B7 characterized as described herein. Heavy and light chain variable domains and CDR sequences of these antibodies are provided below and in Figure 3,\n\n\nThe heavy chain variable domain of 15D2 (SEQ ID NO:6) contains the following CDRs, corresponding to Kabat residues 31-35 (CDR1 ), 50-65 (CDR2) and 95-102 (CDR3) of SEQ ID NO:6, respectively: VH CDR1 : NDIIH\n\n\nVH CDR2: WINAGYGNTQYSQNFQD VH CDR3: EPLWFGESSPHDYYGMDV The heavy chain variable domain of 5B7 (SEQ ID NO:7) contains the following\n\n\nCDRs, corresponding to Kabat residues 31-35 (CDR1 ), 50-65 (CDR2) and 95-102 (CDR3) of SEQ ID NO:7, respectively: VH CDR1 : SHIMH\n\n\nVH CDR2: WINAGYGNTKYSQNFQD VH CDR3: EPLWFGELSPHDYYGMDV\n\n\nThe light chain variable domains of 15D2 and 5B7 (SEQ ID NO:9) contains the following CDRs, corresponding to Kabat residues 24-34 (CDR1 ), 50-56 (CDR2) and 89-97 (CDR3) of SEQ ID NO:9, respectively:\n\n\nVL CDR1 : RASQGISSALA VL CDR2: DASSLES\n\n\nVL CDR3: QQFNSYPLT\n\n\nGiven that 15D2 and 5B7 both bind IL20, the VH CDR sequences can be \"mixed and matched\" to create other anti-hlL20 binding molecules of the invention. The hlL20- binding of such \"mixed and matched\" antibodies can be tested using the binding assays de- scribed herein (e.g. flow cytometry, Biacore, ELISAs) and/or using a receptor-activation assay as described herein. The invention thus provides antibodies that comprise the heavy chain and light chain CDRI s, CDR2s and/or CDR3s of 15D2 or 5B7, or combinations thereof. The CDR regions are delineated using the Kabat system (Figure 3). Given that each of these antibodies can bind to hlL20 with substantially overlapping epitopes, and that anti- gen-binding specificity is provided primarily by the CDR1 , 2 and 3 regions, the VH CDR1 , 2 and 3 sequences can be \"mixed and matched\" (i.e., VH CDRs from different antibodies can be mixed and matched, although each antibody can contain a VH CDR1 , 2 and 3 and a VL CDR1 , 2 and 3) to create other anti-hlL20 binding molecules of the invention. The 15D2 and 5B7 VH CDRs share substantial structural similarity and are therefore amenable to mixing and matching. \n\n Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides an isolated monoclonal antibody comprising: (a) a VH CDR1 from 5B7 or 15D2, (b) a VH CDR2 from 5B7 or 15D2, and (c) a VH CDR3 from 5B7 or 15D2, optionally combined with a VL sequence comprising the VL CDRs of SEQ ID NO:9. This can also be illustrated using consensus VH CDRs, per below. The consensus variable heavy domain of 5B7/15D2 contains the following CDRs, corresponding to Kabat residues 31-35 (CDR1 ), 50-65 (CDR2) and 95-102 (CDR3) of SEQ ID NO:8, respectively, with X representing any amino acid, preferably those listed below or conservative substitutions thereof):\n\n\nVH CDR1 : X\n2\nX\n3\nIX\n4\nH (X\n2\n: N or S; X\n3\n: D or H; X\n4\n: I or M, or conservative substitutions of any thereof)\n\n\nVH CDR2: WI NAGYGNTX\n5\nYSQNFQD (X\n5\n is K, Q, or a conservative substitution of any thereof)\n\n\nVH CDR3: EPLWFGEX\n7\nSPHDYYGMDV (X\n7\n is S, L, or a conservative substitution of any thereof), wherein X\n2\n- X\n5\n and X\n7\n correspond to residues 31 , 32, 34, 59, and 106 in SEQ ID\n\n\nNO:8, respectively.\n\n\nAccordingly, in another aspect, the invention provides an antibody comprising the heavy-chain variable regions CDR2 and CDR3, optionally combined with the CDR1 , of SEQ ID NO:8. In one embodiment, the antibody comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO:8. In one aspect, the antibody comprises the heavy-chain variable region CDR2 and CDR3, optionally combined with the CDR1 , of SEQ ID NO:6. In one embodiment, the antibody comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO:6. In one aspect, the antibody comprises the heavy-chain variable region CDR2 and CDR3, optionally combined with the CDR1 , of SEQ ID NO:7. In one em- bodiment, the antibody comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO:7. In any of these aspects or embodiments, the antibody may optionally further comprise the light-chain variable regions CDR1 , CDR2 and CDR3, or the full sequence, of SEQ ID NO:9.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, an antibody of the invention comprises a VH region from a particular germline H chain immunoglobulin gene, or a combination of particular germline H chain immunoglobulin genes; and/or a VL region from a particular germline L chain immunoglobulin gene, or a combination of particular germline L chain immunoglobulin genes.\n\n\nFor example, in one embodiment, the invention provides an isolated anti-hlL20 antibody comprising a heavy chain variable region that is derived from a set of human genes comprising VH1_03, D3-10, and JH6 genes. The heavy chain variable region may, for exam- pie, comprise the CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, and optionally the CDR1 sequence, of SEQ \n\n ID NO:8, respectively corresponding to Kabat residues 50-65, 95-102, and 31-35. In another embodiment, the antibody further comprises a light chain variable region that is derived from a set of human genes comprising VKI_L18 and JK4 genes. The light-chain variable region may, for example, comprise the CDR1-CDR3 sequences of SEQ ID NO:9. In one embodiment, the invention provides an isolated anti-hlL20 monoclonal antibody, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof, wherein the antibody: (a) comprises a VH domain derived from a human VH1_03 gene recombined with a human D3-10 gene and a JH6 gene, (b) comprises a VL domain derived from a human VKI_L18 gene recombined with a human JK4 gene, and (c) the antibody specifically binds to hlL20. For example, the antibody may comprise the light chain variable sequence of SEQ ID NO:9 and the heavy-chain variable sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 or SEQ ID NO:7.As used herein, a human antibody comprises heavy or light chain variable regions of\" or \"derived from\" or \"the product of\" a particular germline sequence if the variable regions of the antibody are obtained from a system that uses human germline immunoglobulin genes. Such systems include immunizing a transgenic mouse carrying human immunoglobulin genes with the antigen of interest or screening a human immunoglobulin gene library displayed on phage with the antigen of interest. A human antibody that is \"of\" or \"derived from\" or \"the product of\" a human germline immunoglobulin sequence can be identified as such by comparing the amino acid sequence of the human antibody to the amino acid sequences of human germline immunoglobulins and se- lecting the human germline immunoglobulin sequence that is closest in sequence (i.e., greatest % identity) to the sequence of the human antibody. A human antibody that is \"of\" or \"derived from\" or \"the product of\" a particular human germline immunoglobulin sequence may contain amino acid differences as compared to the germline sequence, due to, for example, naturally-occurring somatic mutations or intentional introduction of site-directed muta- tion.\n\n\nHowever, a selected human antibody typically is at least 90% identical in amino acid sequence to an amino acid sequence encoded by a human germline immunoglobulin gene and contains amino acid residues that identify the human antibody as being human when compared to the germline immunoglobulin amino acid sequences of other species (e.g., mur- ine germline sequences). In certain cases, a human antibody variable sequence may be at least 95%, or even at least 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical in amino acid sequence to the amino acid sequence encoded by the recombined germline immunoglobulin gene.\n\n\nTypically, a human antibody derived from a particular human germline sequence will display no more than 10 amino acid differences from the amino acid sequence encoded by the human germline immunoglobulin gene. In certain cases, the human antibody may display \n\n no more than 8, no more than 5, or even no more than 4, 3, 2, or 1 amino acid difference, or no amino acid difference, from the amino acid sequence encoded by the recombined germ- line immunoglobulin gene.\n\n\nIn yet another aspect, an antibody of the invention comprises heavy and light chain variable regions comprising amino acid sequences that are homologous or identical to the amino acid sequences of the preferred 15D2 and 5B7 antibodies described herein, and wherein the antibodies retain the desired functional properties of the anti-hlL20 antibodies of the invention. For example, the invention provides an isolated monoclonal antibody comprising a heavy chain variable domain and a light chain variable domain, wherein: (a) the VH domain comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least 80% identical to an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 6, 7, and 8; (b) the VL region comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least 80% identical to SEQ ID NO:9; and (c) the antibody specifically binds to hlL20 and exhibits at least one of the functional properties described herein, preferably several of the functional properties described herein. In other embodiments, the VH and/or VL amino acid sequences may be 85%, 90%,\n\n\n95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% identical to the sequences set forth above. An antibody having VH and VL regions having high (i.e., 80% or greater) identity to the VH and VL regions of the sequences set forth above, can be obtained by mutagenesis (e.g., site-directed or PCR-mediated mutagenesis) of nucleic acid molecules encoding SEQ ID NOs:6-9, fol- lowed by testing of the encoded altered antibody for retained function (e.g., hlL20 binding affinity or reduction of hlL20-mediated activation of its receptor complexes) using the functional assays described herein.\n\n\nThe percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences (i.e., % identity = # of identical positions/total # of positions x 100), taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm in sequence analysis software. Protein analysis software matches similar sequences using measures of similarity assigned to various substitutions, deletions and other modifications, including conservative amino acid substitutions.\n\n\nThe percent identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined, e.g., using the Needleman and Wunsch (J. MoI. Biol. 48:444-453 (1970)) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package (available at http://www.gcg.com), using either a Blossum 62 matrix or a PAM250 matrix, and a gap weight of 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, or 4 and a length weight of 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. \n\n Polypeptide sequences can also be compared using FASTA, applying default or recommended parameters. A program in GCG Version 6.1., FASTA (e.g., FASTA2 and FASTA3) provides alignments and percent sequence identity of the regions of the best overlap between the query and search sequences (Pearson, Methods Enzymol. 1990;183:63-98; Pearson, Methods MoI. Biol. 2000;132:185-219).\n\n\nThe sequence identity between two amino acid sequences can also be determined using the algorithm of E. Meyers and W. Miller (Comput. Appl. Biosci., 1988;1 1-17) which has been incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0), using a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12 and a gap penalty of 4. Another algorithm for comparing a sequence to another sequence contained in a database is the computer program BLAST, especially blastp, using default parameters. See, e.g., Altschul et al., J. MoI. Biol. 1990;215:403-410; Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 1997;25:3389-402 (1997); each herein incorporated by reference. The protein sequences of the present invention can there be used as a \"query sequence\" to perform a search against public databases to, for example, identify related sequences. Such searches can be performed using the XBLAST program (version 2.0) of Altschul, et al. 1990 (supra). BLAST protein searches can be performed with the XBLAST program, score = 50, wordlength = 3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to the antibody molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as de- scribed in Altschul et al., 1997 (supra). When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., XBLAST and NBLAST) can be used. See http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, an antibody of the invention comprises a VH region comprising CDR1 , CDR2 and CDR3 sequences and a VL region comprising CDR1 , CDR2 and CDR3 sequences, wherein one or more of these CDR sequences comprise specified amino acid sequences based on the preferred antibodies described herein; 15D2 and 5B7, or conservative modifications thereof, and wherein the antibodies retain the desired functional properties of the anti-hlL20 antibodies of the invention. Accordingly, the invention provides an isolated monoclonal antibody, or antigen-binding fragment thereof, comprising a heavy chain variable region comprising CDR1 , CDR2, and CDR3 sequences and a light chain variable region comprising CDR1 , CDR2, and CDR3 sequences, wherein: (a) the VH region CDR3 sequence comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the CDR3 of SEQ ID NOs:6 and 7, and conservative modifications thereof; (b) the VL region CDR3 sequence comprises the amino acid sequence of the CDR3 of SEQ ID NO:9 or con- servative modifications thereof; and (c) the antibody specifically binds to hlL20 and exhibits \n\n at least one of the functional properties described herein, more preferably several of the functional properties described herein.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the VH region CDR2 sequence comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the CDR2 of SEQ ID NOS: 6 or 7, and con- servative modifications thereof; and the VL region CDR2 sequence comprises the CDR2 of SEQ ID NO:9 or conservative modifications thereof.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the VH region CDR1 sequence comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of the CDR1 of SEQ ID NOS: 6 or 7, and conservative modifications thereof; and the VL region CDR1 sequence comprises the CDR1 of SEQ ID NO:9 or conservative modifications thereof.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"conservative sequence modifications\" is intended to refer to amino acid modifications that do not significantly affect or alter the binding characteristics of the antibody containing the amino acid sequence. Such conservative modifications include amino acid substitutions, additions and deletions. Modifications can be introduced into an antibody of the invention by standard techniques known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis.\n\n\n\"Conservative\" amino acid substitutions are typically those in which an amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a side chain with similar physico- chemical properties. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, ar- ginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g. glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine, tryptophan), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine), beta-branched side chains (e.g. threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine).\n\n\nThus, one or more amino acid residues within the CDR regions of an antibody of the invention can be replaced with other amino acid residues from the same side chain family and the altered antibody can be tested for retained function (i.e., the functions set forth in (c), (d) and (e) above) using the functional assays described herein. Antigen-binding fragments\n\n\nThe anti-hlL20 antibodies of the invention as described herein may be prepared as full-length antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof. Full-length antibodies can be of any suitable class including, e.g., IgG and IgM. The specific class and/or isotype of an antibody can be chosen according to the intended therapeutic use. For example, the IgGI , lgG2, \n\n lgG3, and lgG4 isotypes have different affinities for Fc-receptors expressed on, e.g., leukocytes, with lgG4 and lgG2 having lower affinities than IgGI and lgG3.\n\n\nExamples of antigen-binding fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab)2, F(ab')2, F(ab)3, Fv (typically the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody), single-chain Fv (scFv; see e.g., Bird et al., Science 1988;242:423-426; and Huston et al. PNAS 1988;85:5879- 5883), dsFv, Fd (typically the VH and CH1 domain), and dAb (typically a VH domain) fragments; VH, VL, VhH, and V-NAR domains; monovalent molecules comprising a single VH and a single VL chain; minibodies, diabodies, triabodies, tetrabodies, and kappa bodies (see, e.g., Ill et al., Protein Eng 1997;10:949-57); camel IgG; IgNAR; as well as one or more iso- lated CDRs or a functional paratope, where the isolated CDRs or antigen-binding residues or polypeptides can be associated or linked together so as to form a functional antibody fragment. Various types of antibody fragments have been described or reviewed in, e.g., HoI- liger and Hudson, Nat Biotechnol 2005;23:1 126-1136; WO2005040219, and published U.S. Patent Applications 20050238646 and 20020161201. Antibody fragments can be obtained using conventional recombinant or protein engineering techniques, and the fragments can be screened for antigen-binding or other function in the same manner as are intact antibodies.\n\n\nVarious techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally, these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of full-length antibodies (see, e.g., Morimoto et al., Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods, 24:107-1 17\n\n\n(1992); and Brennan et al., Science, 229:81 (1985)). However, these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Alternatively, Fab'-SH fragments can be directly recovered from E. coli and chemically coupled to form F(ab')2 fragments (Carter et al., Bio/Technology, 10:163-167 (1992)). According to another approach, F(ab')2 fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. In other embodiments, the antibody of choice is a single-chain Fv fragment (scFv). See WO 1993/16185; U.S. Pat. No. 5,571 ,894; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,587,458. The antibody fragment may also be a \"linear antibody\", e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,641 ,870, for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific. Multispecific Molecules\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention features multispecific molecules comprising an anti-hlL20 antibody, or an antigen-fragment thereof, of the invention. Such multispecific molecules include bispecific molecules comprising at least one first binding specificity for hlL20 and a second binding specificity for a second target epitope. \n\n One type of bispecific molecules are bispecific antibodies. Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art, and traditional production of full-length bispecific antibodies is usually based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy-chain-light- chain pairs, where the two chains have different specificities (Millstein et al., Nature, 305: 537-539 (1983)). Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full-length antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g. F(ab')2 bispecific antibodies) or any other antigen-binding fragments described herein.\n\n\nOther multispecific molecules include those produced from the fusion of a hlL20- binding antibody moiety to one or more other non-antibody proteins. Such multispecific proteins and how to construct them have been described in the art. See, e.g., Dreier et al. (Bio- conjug. Chem. 9(4): 482-489 (1998)); U.S. Patent 6,046,310; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030103984; European Patent Application 1 413 316; US Patent Publication No. 20040038339; von Strandmann et al., Blood (2006; 107: 1955-1962.), and WO 2004056873. Multispecific molecules with more than two valencies are also contemplated. For example, trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al., J. Immunol, 147: 60 (1991 ).\n\n\nThe multispecific molecules of the present invention can be prepared by conjugating the constituent binding specificities using methods known in the art. For example, each binding specificity of the multispecific molecule can be generated separately and then conjugated to one another. When the binding specificities are proteins or peptides, a variety of coupling or cross-linking agents can be used for covalent conjugation. Examples of cross-linking agents include protein A, carbodiimide, N-succinimidyl-S-acetyl-thioacetate (SATA), 5,5'- dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), o-phenylenedimaleimide (oPDM), N-succinimidyl-3-(2- pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP), and sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohaxane- 1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC) (see e.g., Karpovsky et al. (1984) J. Exp. Med. 160:1686; Liu, MA et al. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:8648). Other methods include those described in Paulus (1985) Behring Ins. Mitt. No. 78, 1 18-132; Brennan et al. (1985) Science 229:81-83), and Glennie et al. (1987) J. Immunol. 139: 2367-2375). Preferred conjugating agents are SATA and sulfo-SMCC, both available from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL). When the binding specificities are antibodies, they can be conjugated via sulthydryl bonding of the C-terminus hinge regions of the two heavy chains. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the hinge region is modified to contain an odd number of sulfhydryl residues, preferably one, prior to conjugation.\n\n\nAlternatively, both binding specificities can be encoded in the same vector and ex- pressed and assembled in the same host cell. This method is particularly useful where the \n\n bispecific molecule is a mAb x mAb, mAb x Fab, Fab x F(ab')2 or ligand x Fab fusion protein. A bispecific molecule of the invention can be a single chain molecule comprising one single chain antibody and a binding determinant, or a single chain bispecific molecule comprising two binding determinants. Bispecific molecules may comprise at least two single chain mole- cules. Methods for preparing bispecific molecules are described or reviewed in, for example in U.S. Patent Number 5,260,203; U.S. Patent Number 5,455,030; U.S. Patent Number 4,881 ,175; U.S. Patent Number 5,132,405; U.S. Patent Number 5,091 , 513; U.S. Patent Number 5,476,786; U.S. Patent Number: 5,013,653; U.S. Patent Number 5,258,498; U.S. Patent Number 5,482,858; U.S. Patent application publication 20030078385, Kontermann et al., (2005) Acta Pharmacological Sinica 26(1 ):1-9; Kostelny et al., (1992) J. Immunol. 148(5): 1547-1553; Hollinger et al., (1993) PNAS (USA) 90:6444-6448; and Gruber ef a/. (1994) J. Immunol. 152: 5368.\n\n\nAntibody variants\n\n\nAn antibody of the invention further can be prepared using an antibody having one or more of the VH and/or VL sequences disclosed herein as starting material to engineer a modified antibody or antibody \"variant\", which modified antibody may have altered properties from the parent antibody. An antibody can be engineered by modifying one or more residues within one or both variable regions (i.e., VH and/or VL), for example within one or more CDR regions and/or within one or more framework regions. Additionally or alternatively, an anti- body can be engineered by modifying residues within the constant region(s), for example to alter the effector function(s) of the antibody. Additionally, from antigen-binding portions of an antibody, other constructs such as antigen-binding fragments, antibody derivatives, immuno- conjugates, and multispecific molecules can be prepared.\n\n\nStandard molecular biology techniques can be used to prepare and express the al- tered antibody sequence.\n\n\nThough an antibody variant or derivative typically has at least one altered property as compared to the \"parent\" antibody, the antibody variant or derivative can retain one, some or most of the functional properties of the anti-hlL20 antibodies described herein, which functional properties include, but are not limited to: (a) reduces hlL20-mediated activation of hu- man IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor complexes, (b) binds to murine and cyno- molgous IL20 orthologs, preferably with substantially similar efficacy or affinity; (c) competes with one or more of 15D2 and 5B7 in binding to hlL20, and (d) binds to an epitope in the segment corresponding to Helix E (Figure 2). Any combination of the above-described functional \n\n features, and/or the functional features as described in the Examples, may be exhibited by an antibody of the invention.\n\n\nThe functional properties of the antibody variants and derivatives can be assessed using standard assays available in the art and/or described herein. For example, the ability of the antibody to bind hlL20 can be determined using standard binding assays, such as those set forth in the Examples (e.g., Biacore, flow cytometry, or ELISAs). Variable region modifications\n\n\nOne type of variable region engineering that can be performed is CDR grafting. Antibodies interact with target antigens predominantly through amino acid residues that are lo- cated in the six heavy and light chain complementarily determining regions (CDRs). For this reason, the amino acid sequences within CDRs are more diverse between individual antibodies than sequences outside of CDRs. Because CDR sequences are responsible for most antibody-antigen interactions, it is possible to express recombinant antibodies that mimic the properties of specific naturally occurring antibodies by constructing expression vectors that include CDR sequences from the specific naturally occurring antibody grafted onto framework sequences from a different antibody with different properties (see, e.g., Riechmann, L. et al. (1998) Nature 332:323-327; Jones, P. et al. (1986) Nature 321 :522-525; Queen, C. et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86:10029-10033;U.S.Patent No. 5,225,539 to Winter, and U.S. Patent Nos. 5, 530,101 ; 5,585,089; 5,693,762 and 6,180,370 to Queen et al.) Ac- cordingly, another embodiment of the invention pertains to an isolated monoclonal antibody, or antigen binding portion thereof, comprising the VH and/or VL CDR sequences of monoclonal antibodies 15D2 or 5B7, but framework sequences different from these antibodies. Framework sequences can be obtained from public DNA databases or published references that include germline antibody gene sequences. For example, germline DNA se- quences for human heavy and light chain variable region genes can be found in the \"dBase\" human germline sequence database (available on the Internet at www.mrc- cpe.cam.ac.uk/vbase), as well as in Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991 ) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242; Tomlinson, I. M., et al. (1992) \"The Repertoire of Human Germline VH Sequences Reveals about Fifty Groups of VH Segments with Different Hypervariable Loops\" J. MoI. Biol. 227:776-798; and Cox, J. P. L. et al. (1994) \"A Directory of Human Germ-line VH Segments Reveals a Strong Bias in their Usage\" Eur. J. Immunol. 24:827-836; the contents of each of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nPreferred framework sequences for use in the antibodies of the invention are those that are structurally similar to the framework sequences used by selected antibodies of the \n\n invention, e.g., similar to the VH1_03, D3-10, JH6, VKIJ.18, and/or JK4 sequences of 15D2 or 5B7. The VH CDR1 , 2 and 3 sequences of 15D2 or 5B7 can be grafted onto framework regions that have the same sequence as that found in the germline immunoglobulin gene from which the framework sequence derive, or the CDR sequences can be grafted onto framework regions that contain one or more mutations as compared to the germline sequences. For example, it has been found that in certain instances it is beneficial to mutate residues within the framework regions to maintain or enhance the antigen binding ability of the antibody (see e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,530,101 ; 5,585,089; 5,693,762 and 6,180,370 to Queen et a/.). In another aspect of the invention, the structural features of anti-hlL20 antibodies of the invention, e.g., 15D2 and 5B7, are used to create structurally related anti-hlL20 antibodies that retain at least one functional property of the antibodies of the invention, such as binding to hlL20. For example, one or more CDR regions of 5B7 or 15D2, or variants thereof, can be combined recombinantly with known framework regions and/or other CDRs to create ad- ditional, recombinantly-engineered, anti-hlL20 antibodies of the invention. The starting material for the engineering method is one or more of the VH and/or VL sequences provided herein, or one or more CDR regions thereof. To create the engineered antibody, it is not necessary to actually prepare (i.e., express as a protein) an antibody having one or more of the VH and/or VL sequences provided herein, or one or more CDR regions thereof. Rather, the information contained in the sequence(s) is used as the starting material to create a\n\n\n\"second generation\" sequence(s) derived from the original sequence(s) and then the \"second generation\" sequence(s) is prepared and expressed as a protein.\n\n\nAccordingly, in another embodiment, the invention provides a method for preparing an anti-hlL20 antibody comprising: (a) providing: (i) a heavy chain variable region antibody sequence comprising CDR1 , CDR2, and CDR3 sequences from SEQ ID NOS:6 or 7, and (ii) a light chain variable region antibody sequence comprising CDR sequences from SEQ ID NO:9; (b) altering at least one amino acid residue within the first antibody sequence and/or the second antibody sequence to create at least one altered antibody sequence; and (c) preparing the altered antibody sequence; and (d) expressing the altered antibody sequence as a protein.\n\n\nAnother type of variable region modification is to mutate amino acid residues within the VH and/or VL CDR1 , CDR2 and/or CDR3 regions to thereby improve one or more binding properties (e.g., affinity) of the antibody of interest. Site-directed mutagenesis or PCR- mediated mutagenesis can be performed to introduce the mutation(s) and the effect on anti- body binding, or other functional property of interest, can be evaluated in in vitro or in vivo \n\n assays as described herein and provided in the Examples. Preferably conservative modifications (as discussed above) are introduced. The mutations may be amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions. Moreover, typically no more than 8, more typically no more than 5 residues are altered within a single CDR region. Accordingly, in another embodiment, the invention provides isolated anti-hlL20 monoclonal antibodies, or antigen-binding fragments thereof, comprising a heavy chain variable region comprising VH CDR1 , CDR2, and CDR3 sequences of SEQ ID NO:6 or 7, or amino acid sequences having one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or eight amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions in one or more of these CDRs; and a light chain variable re- gion comprising VL CDR1 , CDR2, and CDR3 sequences from SEQ ID NO:9, or amino acid sequences having one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or eight amino acid substitutions, deletions or additions in one or more of these CDRs.\n\n\nEngineered antibodies of the invention include those in which modifications have been made to framework residues within VH and/or VL, e.g. to improve the properties of the antibody. Typically such framework modifications are made to decrease the immunogenicity of the antibody. For example, one approach is to \"backmutate\" one or more framework residues to the corresponding germline sequence. More specifically, an antibody that has undergone somatic mutation may contain framework residues that differ from the germline sequence from which the antibody is derived. Such residues can be identified by comparing the antibody framework sequences to the germline sequences from which the antibody is derived.\n\n\nFor example, for 15D2 and 5B7, the VH residues that are different from the corresponding germline sequence are indicated by \"\n*\n\" in Figure 3. To return, e.g., the framework region sequences to their germline configuration, the somatic mutations outside the CDRs can be \"backmutated\" to the germline sequence by, for example, site-directed mutagenesis or PCR-mediated mutagenesis (e.g., residues 13, 68, and/or 82A of the 15D2 VH domain or residues 13, 30 and/or 82A of the 5B7 VH domain can be \"backmutated\" from the VH amino acid to the germline amino acid. Such \"backmutated\" antibodies are also intended to be encompassed by the invention. Another type of framework modification involves mutating one or more residues within the framework region, or even within one or more CDR regions, to remove T cell epitopes to thereby reduce the potential immunogenicity of the antibody. This approach is also referred to as \"deimmunization\" and is described in futher detail in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030153043 by Carr et al. \n\n Fc modifications\n\n\nIn addition or as an alternative to modifications made within the framework or CDR regions, antibodies of the invention may be engineered to include modifications within the Fc region, typically to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody, such as serum half-life, complement fixation, Fc receptor binding, protein stability and/or antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, or lack thereof. Furthermore, an antibody of the invention may be chemically modified (e.g., one or more chemical moieties can be attached to the antibody) or be modified to alter its glycosylation, again to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody. Each of these embodiments is described in further detail below. The residues in the Fc region are numbered according to Kabat.\n\n\nIf desired, the class of an antibody may be \"switched\" by known techniques. Such techniques include, e.g., the use of direct recombinant techniques (see e.g., US Patent 4,816,397) and cell-cell fusion techniques (see e.g., US Patent 5,916,771 ). For example, an antibody that was originally produced as an IgM molecule may be class switched to an IgG antibody. Class switching techniques also may be used to convert one IgG subclass to another, e.g., from IgGI to lgG2. Thus, the effector function of the antibodies of the invention may be changed by isotype switching to, e.g., an IgGI , lgG2, lgG3, lgG4, IgD, IgA, IgE, or IgM antibody for various therapeutic uses. Exemplary cDNA sequences for constant regions are available via, e.g., GenBank, each of which incorporated by reference in its entirety, are as follows:\n\n\nHuman IgGI constant heavy chain region: GenBank accession No.: J00228; Human lgG2 constant heavy chain region: GenBank accession No.: J00230; Human lgG3 constant heavy chain region: GenBank accession No.: X04646; Human lgG4 constant heavy chain region: GenBank accession No.: K01316; and Human kappa light chain constant region: GenBank accession No.: J00241.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the hinge region of CH1 is modified such that the number of cysteine residues in the hinge region is altered, e.g., increased or decreased. This approach is described further in U.S. Patent No. 5,677,425 by Bodmer et al. The number of cysteine residues in the hinge region of CH 1 is altered to, for example, facilitate assembly of the light and heavy chains or to increase or decrease the stability of the antibody.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the Fc hinge region of an antibody is mutated to decrease the biological half life of the antibody. More specifically, one or more amino acid mutations are introduced into the CH2-CH3 domain interface region of the Fc-hinge fragment such that the antibody has impaired Staphylococcyl protein A (SpA) binding relative to native Fc-hinge domain SpA binding. This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Patent No. \n\n 6,165,745 by Ward et al. In another embodiment, the antibody is modified to increase its biological half life. Various approaches are possible. For example, one or more of the following mutations can be introduced: T252L, T254S, T256F, as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,277,375 to Ward. Alternatively, to increase the biological half life, the antibody can be al- tered within the CH 1 or CL region to contain a salvage receptor binding epitope taken from two loops of a CH2 domain of an Fc region of an IgG, as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,869, 046 and 6,121 ,022 by Presta et al. In yet other embodiments, the Fc region is altered by replacing at least one amino acid residue with a different amino acid residue to alter the effecter function(s) of the antibody. For example, one or more amino acids selected from amino acid residues 234, 235, 236, 237, 297, 318, 320 and 322 can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has an altered affinity for an effector ligand but retains the antigen-binding ability of the parent antibody. The effector ligand to which affinity is altered can be, for example, an Fc receptor or the C1 component of complement. This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,624, 821 and 5,648,260, both to Winter et al. In another example, one or more amino acids selected from amino acid residues 329, 331 and 322 can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has altered C1q binding and/or reduced or abolished complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,194,551 by ldusogie et al. In another example, one or more amino acid residues within amino acid posi- tions 231 and 239 are altered to thereby alter the ability of the antibody to fix complement. This approach is described further in PCT Publication WO 94/29351 by Bodmer et al. In yet another example, the Fc region is modified to increase the ability of the antibody to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or to increase the affinity of the antibody for an Fey receptor by modifying one or more amino acids at the following positions: 238, 239, 248, 249, 252, 254, 255, 256, 258, 265, 267, 268, 269, 270, 272, 276, 278, 280, 283, 285, 286, 289, 290, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 298, 301 , 303, 305, 307, 309, 312, 315, 320, 322, 324, 326, 327, 329, 330, 331 , 333, 334, 335, 337, 338, 340, 360, 373, 376, 378, 382, 388, 389, 398, 414, 416, 419, 430, 434, 435, 437, 438 or 439. This approach is described further in PCT Publication WO 00/42072 by Presta. Moreover, the binding sites on human IgGI for FcyRI, FcyRII, FcyRIII and FcRn have been mapped and variants with improved binding have been described (see Shields, R.L. et al. (2001 ) J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591-6604). Specific mutations at positions 256, 290, 298, 333, 334 and 339 were shown to improve binding to FcRIII. Additionally, the following combination mutants were shown to improve FcyRIII binding: T256A/S298A, S298A/E333A, S298A/K224A and S298A/E333A/K334A. \n\n The constant region may further be modified to stabilize the antibody, e.g., to reduce the risk of a bivalent antibody separating into two monovalent VH-VL fragments. For example, in an lgG4 constant region, the Serine (S, Ser) residue at position 241 according to the Kabat numbering system may be mutated to a proline (P, Pro) residue to allow complete di- sulphide bridge formation at the hinge (see, e.g., Angal et al., MoI Immunol. 1993;30:105-8). According to the EU index numbering system, Kabat residue 241 , corresponds to residue 228.\n\n\nGlycosylation modifications\n\n\nIn still another embodiment, the glycosylation of an antibody is modified. For exam- pie, an aglycoslated antibody can be made (i.e., the antibody lacks glycosylation). Glycosylation can be altered to, for example, increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region framework glyco- sylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,714, 350 and 6,350,861 by Co et al. Additionally or alternatively, an antibody can be made that has an altered type of glycosylation, such as a hypofucosylated antibody having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues or an antibody having increased bi- secting GlcNac structures. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies of the invention to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. For example, EP1176195 by Hanai et al. describes a cell line with a functionally disrupted FUT8 gene, which encodes a fucosyl transferase, such that antibodies expressed in such a cell line exhibit hypofucosylation. PCT Publication WO 03/035835 by Presta describes a variant CHO cell line, Lecl3 cells, with reduced ability to attach fucose to Asn(297)-linked carbohydrates, also resulting in hypofucosylation of antibodies expressed in that host cell (see also Shields, R. L. et al. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-26740). PCT Publication WO 99/54342 by Umana et al. describes cell lines engineered to express glycoprotein-modifying glycosyl transferases (e.g., beta(l,4)-N- acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnTIII)) such that antibodies expressed in the engineered cell lines exhibit increased bisecting GlcNac structures which results in increased ADCC ac- tivity of the antibodies (see also Umana et al. (1999) Nat. Biotech. 7:176 180). \n\n In certain embodiments of the methods of engineering antibodies of the invention, mutations can be introduced randomly or selectively along all or part of an anti-hlL20 antibody coding sequence (e.g., a 15D2 or 5B7 coding sequence) and the resulting modified antibodies can be screened for binding activity and/or other functional properties as described herein. Mutational methods have been described in the art. For example, PCT Publication WO 02/092780 by Short describes methods for creating and screening antibody mutations using saturation mutagenesis, synthetic ligation assembly, or a combination thereof.\n\n\nAlternatively, PCT Publication WO 03/074679 by Lazar et al. describes methods of using computational screening methods to optimize physiochemical properties of antibodies.\n\n\nAntibody derivatives\n\n\nAntibody derivatives (or immunoconjugates) within the scope of this invention include anti-hlL20 antibodies conjugated or covalently bound to a second agent.\n\n\nFor example, in one aspect, the invention provides immunoconjugates comprising an antibody conjugated or covalently bonded to a cytotoxic agent. The term \"cytotoxic agent\" as used herein is a molecule that is capable of killing a cell to which it becomes associated, e.g., via IL20-binding to cell-surface hlL20 receptors. Any type of moiety with a cytotoxic or cytoinhibitory effect can be conjugated to the present antibodies to form a cytotoxic conjugate of the present invention, including therapeutic radioisotopes, toxic proteins, toxic small molecules, such as drugs, toxins, immunomodulators, hormones, hormone antagonists, en- zymes, oligonucleotides, enzyme inhibitors, therapeutic radionuclides, angiogenesis inhibitors, chemotherapeutic drugs, vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, epidophyllotoxins, taxanes, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, antibiotics, COX-2 inhibitors, SN-38, antimitotics, antian- giogenic and apoptotoic agents, particularly doxorubicin, methotrexate, taxol, CPT-11 , camp- tothecans, nitrogen mustards, gemcitabine, alkyl sulfonates, nitrosoureas, triazenes, folic acid analogs, pyrimidine analogs, purine analogs, platinum coordination complexes, Pseu- domonas exotoxin, ricin, abrin, 5-fluorouridine, ribonuclease (RNase), DNase I, Staphylococcal enterotoxin-A, pokeweed antiviral protein, gelonin, diphtherin toxin, Pseudomonas exotoxin, and Pseudomonas endotoxin and others (see, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 19th Ed. (Mack Publishing Co. 1995); Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacologi- cal Basis of Therapeutics (McGraw Hill, 2001 ); Pastan et al. (1986) Cell 47:641 ; Goldenberg (1994) Cancer Journal for Clinicians 44:43; U.S. Pat. No. 6,077,499; the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference). It will be appreciated that a toxin can be of animal, plant, fungal, or microbial origin, or can be created de novo by chemical synthesis. \n\n In another embodiment, the antibody is derivatized with a radioactive isotope, such as a therapeutic radionuclide or a radionuclide suitable for detection purposes. Any of a number of suitable radioactive isotopes can be used, including, but not limited to, 1-131 , In- dium-11 1 , Lutetium-171 , Bismuth-212, Bismuth-213, Astatine-211 , Copper-62, Copper-64, Copper-67, Yttrium-90, lodine-125, lodine-131 , Phosphorus-32, Phosphorus-33, Scandium- 47, Silver-111 , Gallium-67, Praseodymium-142, Samarium-153, Terbium-161 , Dysprosium- 166, Holmium-166, Rhenium-186, Rhenium-188, Rhenium-189, Lead-212, Radium-223, Ac- tinium-225, lron-59, Selenium-75, Arsenic-77, Strontium-89, Molybdenum-99, Rhodium-105, Palladium-109, Praseodymium-143, Promethium-149, Erbium-169, lridium-194, Gold-198, Gold-199, and Lead-21 1. In general, the radionuclide preferably has a decay energy in the range of 20 to 6,000 keV, preferably in the ranges 60 to 200 keV for an Auger emitter, 100- 2,500 keV for a beta emitter, and 4,000-6,000 keV for an alpha emitter. Also preferred are radionuclides that substantially decay with generation of alpha-particles.\n\n\nThe antibody conjugates of the invention can be used to modify a given biological response, where the drug moiety is not to be construed as limited to classical chemical therapeutic agents. For example, the drug moiety may be a protein or polypeptide possessing a desired biological activity. Such proteins may include, for example, an enzymatically active toxin, or active fragment thereof, such as abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin; a protein such as tumor necrosis factor or interferon-y; or, biological re- sponse modifiers such as, for example, lymphokines, interleukin-l (\"IL1\"), interleukin-2 (\"IL2\"), interleukin-6 (\"IL-6\"), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (\"GM-CSF\"), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (\"G-CSF\"), or other growth factors.\n\n\nThe second agent can be linked to the antibody directly or indirectly, using any of a large number of available methods. For example, an agent can be attached at the hinge re- gion of the reduced antibody component via disulfide bond formation, using cross-linkers such as N-succinyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)proprionate (SPDP), or via a carbohydrate moiety in the Fc region of the antibody (see, e.g., Yu et al.

Rev. 53:247-264.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the second agent is a detectable moiety, which can be any molecule that can be quantitatively or qualitatively observed or measured. Examples of de- tectable markers useful in the conjugated antibodies of this invention are radioisotopes, fluorescent dyes, or a member of a complementary binding pair, such as a member of any one of: and antigen/antibody (other than an antibody to IL20), lectin/carbohydrate; avidin/biotin; receptor/ligand; or molecularly imprinted polymer/print molecule systems.\n\n\nThe second agent may also or alternatively be a polymer, intended to, e.g., increase the circulating half-life of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. Exemplary polymers and methods to attach such polymers to peptides are illustrated in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,766,106; 4,179,337; 4,495,285; and 4,609,546. Additional illustrative polymers include polyoxyethylated polyols and polyethylene glycol (PEG) moieties. As used herein, the term \"polyethylene glycol\" is intended to encompass any of the forms of PEG that have been used to derivatize other proteins, such as mono (C1-C10) alkoxy-or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol or polyethylene glycol-maleimide. For example, a full-length antibody or antibody fragment can be conjugated to one or more PEG molecules with a molecular weight of between about 1 ,000 and about 40,000, such as between about 2000 and about 20,000, e.g., about 3,000- 12,000. To pegylate an antibody or fragment thereof, the antibody or fragment typically is re- acted with polyethylene glycol (PEG), such as a reactive ester or aldehyde derivative of \n\n PEG, under conditions in which one or more PEG groups become attached to the antibody or antibody fragment. Preferably, the pegylation is carried out via an acylation reaction or an alkylation reaction with a reactive PEG molecule (or an analogous reactive water-soluble polymer). In certain embodiments, the antibody to be pegylated is an a glycosylated anti- body. Methods for pegylating proteins are known in the art and can be applied to the antibodies of the invention. See for example, WO2004099231 , WO2003031464, EP154316 (by Ni- shimura et a/.) and EP401384 (by Ishikawa et a/.).\n\n\nNucleic acids\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention pertains to nucleic acid molecules that encode the antibodies of the invention. The nucleic acids may be present in whole cells, in a cell lysate, or in a partially purified or substantially pure form. A nucleic acid is \"isolated\" or \"rendered substantially pure\" when purified away from other cellular components or other contaminants, e.g., other cellular nucleic acids or proteins, by standard techniques, including alkaline/SDS treatment, CsCI banding, column chromatography, agarose gel electrophoresis and others well known in the art. See, F. Ausubel, et al., ed. (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing and Wiley Interscience, New York. A nucleic acid of the invention can be, for example, DNA or RNA and may or may not contain intronic sequences. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid is a cDNA molecule.\n\n\nNucleic acids of the invention can be obtained using standard molecular biology techniques. For antibodies expressed by hybridomas (e.g., hybridomas prepared from transgenic mice carrying human immunoglobulin genes as described further below), cDNAs encoding the light and heavy chains of the antibody made by the hybridoma can be obtained by standard PCR amplification or cDNA cloning techniques. For antibodies obtained from an immunoglobulin gene library (e.g., using phage display techniques), nucleic acids encoding the antibody can be recovered from the library. Preferred nucleic acids molecules of the invention are those encoding heavy and light chain sequences of 15D2 or 5B7 monoclonal antibodies of the lgG2 or lgG4 isotype, more preferably lgG4.\n\n\nOnce DNA fragments encoding VH and VL segments are obtained, these DNA fragments can be further manipulated by standard recombinant DNA techniques, for example to convert the variable region genes to full-length antibody chain genes, to Fab fragment genes or to a scFv gene. In these manipulations, a VL- or VH-encoding DNA fragment is operatively linked to another DNA fragment encoding another protein, such as an antibody constant region or a flexible linker. The term \"operatively linked\", as used in this context, is \n\n intended to mean that the two DNA fragments are joined such that the amino acid sequences encoded by the two DNA fragments remain in-frame.\n\n\nThe isolated DNA encoding the VH region can be converted to a full-length heavy chain gene by operatively linking the VH-encoding DNA to another DNA molecule encoding heavy chain constant regions (CH1 , CH2 and CH3). The sequences of human heavy chain constant region genes are known in the art (see e.g., Kabat, E. A., el al. (I 991 ) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242) and DNA fragments encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard PCR amplification. The heavy chain constant region can be an IgGI , lgG2, lgG3, lgG4, IgA, IgE, IgM or IgD constant region, but most preferably is an lgG4 constant region. For a Fab fragment heavy chain gene, the VH-encoding DNA can be operatively linked to another DNA molecule encoding only the heavy chain CH1 constant region.\n\n\nThe isolated DNA encoding the VL region can be converted to a full-length light chain gene (as well as a Fab light chain gene) by operatively linking the VL-encoding DNA to another DNA molecule encoding the light chain constant region, CL. The sequences of human light chain constant region genes are known in the art (see e.g., Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991 ) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242) and DNA fragments encompassing these regions can be obtained by standard PCR amplification. The light chain constant region can be a kappa or lambda constant region, but most preferably is a kappa constant region.\n\n\nTo create a scFv gene, the VH-and VL-encoding DNA fragments are operatively linked to another fragment encoding a flexible linker, e.g., encoding the amino acid sequence (Gly4-Ser)3, such that the VH and VL sequences can be expressed as a contiguous single- chain protein, with the VL and VH regions joined by the flexible linker (see e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science 242:423-426; Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883; McCafferty et al., (1990) Nature 348:552-554).\n\n\nAntibody production\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) of the present invention can be produced by a variety of techniques, including conventional monoclonal antibody methodology e.g., the standard somatic cell hybridization technique of Kohler and Milstein (1975) Nature 256: 495. Although somatic cell hybridization procedures are preferred, in principle, other techniques for producing monoclonal antibody can be employed e.g., viral or oncogenic transformation of B lymphocytes. \n\n One preferred animal system for preparing hybridomas is the murine system. Immunization protocols and techniques for isolation of immunized splenocytes for fusion are known in the art, as are fusion partners (e.g., murine myeloma cells) and fusion procedures. Chimeric or humanized antibodies of the present invention can also be prepared based on the sequence of a murine monoclonal antibody using established techniques. For example, DNA encoding the heavy and light chain immunoglobulins can be obtained from the murine hybridoma of interest and engineered to contain non-murine (e.g., human) immunoglobulin sequences using standard molecular biology techniques. For example, to create a chimeric antibody, the murine variable regions can be linked to human constant regions using meth- ods known in the art (see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567 to Cabilly et a/.). To create a humanized antibody, the murine CDR regions can be inserted into a human framework using methods known in the art (see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,225,539 to Winter, and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,530,101 ; 5, 585,089; 5,693,762 and 6,180,370 to Queen et ai).\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are human monoclonal antibodies. Such human monoclonal antibodies directed against hlL20 can be generated using transgenic or transchromosomic mice carrying parts of the human immune system rather than the mouse system. These transgenic and transchromosomic mice include mice referred to herein as HuMAb mice and KM mice, respectively, and are collectively referred to herein as \"human Ig mice.\" The HuMAb mouse (Medarex, Inc.) contains human immunoglobulin gene miniloci that encode unrearranged human heavy (p and y) and K light chain immunoglobulin sequences, together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous, u and K chain loci (see e.g., Lonberg, et al. (1994) Nature 368: 856-859). Accordingly, the mice exhibit reduced expression of mouse IgM or K, and, in response to immunization, the introduced human heavy and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic muta- tion to generate high affinity human IgGK monoclonal (Lonberg, N. et al. (1994), supra; reviewed in Lonberg, N. (1994) Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology 1 13:49-101 ; Lonberg, N. and Huszar, D. (1995) Intern. Rev. Immunol. 13: 65-93, and Harding, F. and Lonberg, N. (1995) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 764:536-546). The preparation and use of HuMab mice, and the genomic modifications carried by such mice, is further described in Taylor, L. et al. (1992) Nucleic Acids Research 20:6287-6295; Chen, J. et al. (1993)lnternational Immunology 5: 647-656; Tuaillon et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:3720-3724; Choi et al. (1993) Nature Genetics 4: 117-123; Chen, J. et al. (1993) EMBO J. 12: 821-830; Tuaillon et al. (1994) J. Immunol. 152:2912 2920; Taylor, L. et al. (1994) International immunology 6: 579-591 ; and Fishwild, D. et al. (1996) Nature Biotechnology 14: 845-851 , the contents of all of which are hereby specifically incorporated by reference in their entirety. See \n\n further, U. S. Patent Nos. 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; 5,789,650; 5, 877,397; 5,661 ,016; 5,814,318; 5,874,299; and 5,770,429; all to Lonberg and Kay; U.S. Patent No. 5,545,807 to Surani et al.; PCT Publication Nos. WO 92/03918, WO 93/12227, WO 94/25585, WO 97/13852, WO 98/24884 and WO 99/45962, all to Lonberg and Kay; and PCT Publication No. WO 01/14424 to Korman et al. In another embodiment, human antibodies of the invention can be raised using a mouse that carries human immunoglobulin sequences on transgenes and transchomosomes, such as a mouse that carries a human heavy chain transgene and a human light chain transchromosome. Such mice, referred to herein as \"KM mice\", are described in detail in PCT Publication WO 02/43478 to lshida et al. Still further, alternative transgenic animal systems expressing human immunoglobulin genes are available in the art and can be used to raise anti-hlL20 antibodies of the invention. For example, an alternative transgenic system referred to as the Xenomouse (Abgenix, Inc.) can be used; such mice are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,939,598; 6,075,181 ; 6,1 14,598; 6, 150,584 and 6,162,963 to Kucherlapati et al. Moreover, alternative transchromosomic animal systems expressing human immunoglobulin genes are available in the art and can be used to raise anti-hlL20 antibodies of the invention. For example, mice carrying both a human heavy chain transchromosome and a human light chain tranchromosome, referred to as \"TC mice\" can be used; such mice are described in Tomizuka et al. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:722-727. Furthermore, cows carrying human heavy and light chain transchro- mosomes have been described in the art (Kuroiwa et al. (2002) Nature Biotechnology 20:889-894) and can be used to raise anti-hlL20 antibodies of the invention.\n\n\nHuman monoclonal antibodies of the invention can also be prepared using phage display methods for screening libraries of human immunoglobulin genes. Such phage display methods for isolating human antibodies are established in the art. See for example: U.S. Patent Nos. 5,223,409; 5, 403,484; and 5,571 ,698 to Ladner et al.; U.S. Patent Nos. 5, 427,908 and 5, 580,717 to Dower et al.; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,969,108 and 6, 172,197 to McCafferty et al.; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,885,793; 6,521 ,404; 6,544,731 ; 6,555,313; 6,582,915 and 6,593,081 to Griffiths et al. Human monoclonal antibodies of the invention can also be prepared using SCID mice into which human immune cells have been reconstituted such that a human antibody response can be generated upon immunization. Such mice are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,476,996 and 5,698,767 to Wilson et al.\n\n\nWhen human Ig mice are used to raise human antibodies of the invention, such mice can be immunized with a purified or enriched preparation of hlL20 antigen, as described by Lonberg, N. et al. (1994) Nature 368(6474): 856-859; Fishwild, D. et al. (1996) NatureBiotechnolo,gy 14: 845-851 ; and PCT Publication WO 98/24884 and WO 01/14424. \n\n Preferably, the mice will be 6-16 weeks of age upon the first infusion. For example, a purified or enriched preparation (5-50 μg) of hlL20 antigen can be used to immunize the human Ig mice intraperitoneal^.\n\n\nThe form and amount of antigen administered (e.g., hlL20 polypeptide), as well as administration schedules and the possible use of adjuvants such as, e.g., complete Freund's adjuvant or incomplete Freund's adjuvant, are typically optimized for each antigen-mouse system according to established methods in the art.\n\n\nThe immune response can be monitored over the course of the immunization protocol with plasma samples being obtained by retroorbital bleeds, and the plasma or serum can be screened by ELISA (as described below), and mice with sufficient titers of anti-hlL20 human immunoglobulin can be used for fusions. Mice can be boosted intravenously with antigen 3 days before sacrifice and removal of the spleen. It is expected that 2-3 fusions for each immunization may need to be performed.\n\n\nTo generate hybridomas producing human monoclonal antibodies of the invention, splenocytes and/or lymph node cells from immunized mice can be isolated and fused to an appropriate immortalized cell line, such as a mouse myeloma cell line. The resulting hybridomas can be screened for the production of antigen-specific antibodies. For example, single cell suspensions of splenic lymphocytes from immunized mice can be fused to one-sixth the number of P3X63-Ag8.653 nonsecreting mouse myeloma cells (ATCC, CRL 1580) with 50% PEG. Alternatively, the cells can be fused by electrofusion. Cells are plated at approximately 2 x 10\n5\n in a flat bottom microtiter plate, followed by a two week incubation in selective medium containing 20% fetal Clone Serum, 18% \"653\" conditioned media, 5% origen (IGEN), 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5mM HEPES, 0.055 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 mg/ml gentamycin and 1X HAT (Sigma; the HAT is added 24 hours after the fusion). After approximately two weeks, cells can be cultured in medium in which the HAT is replaced with HT. Individual wells can then be screened by ELISA for human monoclonal IgM and IgG antibodies. Once extensive hybridoma growth occurs, medium can be observed usually after 10-14 days. The antibody secreting hybridomas can be replated, screened again, and if still positive for human IgG, the monoclonal an- tibodies can be subcloned at least twice by limiting dilution. The stable subclones can then be cultured in vitro to generate small amounts of antibody in tissue culture medium for characterization. To purify human monoclonal antibodies, selected hybridomas can be grown in two-liter spinner-flasks for monoclonal antibody purification. Supernatants can be filtered and concentrated before affinity chromatography with protein A-sepharose (Pharmacia, Piscata- way, N. J.). Eluted IgG can be checked by gel electrophoresis and high performance liquid \n\n chromatography to ensure purity. The buffer solution can be exchanged into PBS, and the concentration can be determined by spectroscopy. The monoclonal antibodies can be ali- quoted and stored at -80°\n\n\nAntibodies of the invention can also be produced in a host cell transfectoma using, for example, a combination of recombinant DNA techniques and gene transfection methods as is well known in the art (e.g. , Morrison, S. (1985) Science 229:1202).\n\n\nFor example, to express the antibodies, or antibody fragments thereof, DNAs encoding partial or full-length light and heavy chains, can be obtained by standard molecular biology techniques (e.g. PCR amplification or cDNA cloning using a hybridoma that expresses the antibody of interest) and the DNAs can be inserted into expression vectors such that the genes are operatively linked to transcriptional and translational control sequences. In this context, the term \"operatively linked\" is intended to mean that an antibody gene is ligated into a vector such that transcriptional and translational control sequences within the vector serve their intended function of regulating the transcription and translation of the antibody gene. The expression vector and expression control sequences are chosen to be compatible with the expression host cell used. The antibody light chain gene and the antibody heavy chain gene can be inserted into separate vector or, more typically, both genes are inserted into the same expression vector. The antibody genes are inserted into the expression vector by standard methods (e.g., ligation of complementary restriction sites on the antibody gene fragment and vector, or blunt end ligation if no restriction sites are present). The light and heavy chain variable regions of the antibodies described herein can be used to create full- length antibody genes of any antibody isotype by inserting them into expression vectors already encoding heavy chain constant and light chain constant regions of the desired isotype such that the VH segment is operatively linked to the CH segment(s) within the vector and the VL segment is operatively linked to the CL segment within the vector. Additionally or alternatively, the recombinant expression vector can encode a signal peptide that facilitates secretion of the antibody chain from a host cell. The antibody chain gene can be cloned into the vector such that the signal peptide is linked in-frame to the amino terminus of the antibody chain gene. The signal peptide can be an immunoglobulin signal peptide or a heterolo- gous signal peptide (i.e., a signal peptide from a non-immunoglobulin protein).\n\n\nIn addition to the antibody chain genes, the recombinant expression vectors of the invention carry regulatory sequences that control the expression of the antibody chain genes in a host cell. The term \"regulatory sequence\" is intended to include promoters, enhancers and other expression control elements (e.g. polyadenylation signals) that control the tran- scription or translation of the antibody chain genes. Such regulatory sequences are de- \n\n scribed, for example, in Goeddel (Gene Expression Technology, Methods in Enzymology 185, Academic Press, San Diego, CA (1990)).\n\n\nIt will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the design of the expression vector, including the selection of regulatory sequences, may depend on such factors as the choice of the host cell to be transformed, the level of expression of protein desired, etc. Preferred regulatory sequences for mammalian host cell expression include viral elements that direct high levels of protein expression in mammalian cells, such as promoters and/or enhancers derived from cytomegalovirus (CMV), Simian Virus 40 (SV40), adenovirus, (e.g., the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) and polyoma. Alternatively, nonviral regulatory se- quences may be used, such as the ubiquitin promoter or p-globin promoter. Still further, regulatory elements composed of sequences from different sources, such as the SRa promoter system, which contains sequences from the SV40 early promoter and the long terminal repeat of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (Takebe, Y. et al. (1988) MoI. Cell. Biol. 8:466-472). In addition to the antibody chain genes and regulatory sequences, the recombinant expression vectors of the invention may carry additional sequences, such as sequences that regulate replication of the vector in host cells (e.g. origins of replication) and selectable marker genes. The selectable marker gene facilitates selection of host cells into which the vector has been introduced (see, e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,634,665 and 5,179,017, all by Axel et al.). For example, typically the selectable marker gene confers resistance to drugs, such as G418, hygromycin or methotrexate, on a host cell into which the vector has been introduced. Preferred selectable marker genes include the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene (for use in dhfr-host cells with methotrexate selection/amplification) and the neo gene (for G418 selection). For expression of the light and heavy chains, the expression vector(s) encoding the heavy and light chains is transfected into a host cell by standard techniques. The various forms of the term \"transfection\" are intended to encompass a wide variety of techniques commonly used for the introduction of exogenous DNA into a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cell, e.g., electroporation, calcium-phosphate precipitation, DEAE-dextran transfection and the like. Although it is theoretically possible to express the antibodies of the invention in either prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells, expression of antibodies in eukaryotic cells, and most preferably mammalian host cells, is the most preferred because such eukaryotic cells, and in particular mammalian cells, are more likely than prokaryotic cells to assemble and secrete a properly folded and immunologically active antibody. Prokaryotic expression of anti- \n\n body genes has been reported to be ineffective for production of high yields of active antibody (Boss, M. A. and Wood, C. R. (1985) Immunology Today 6:12-13).\n\n\nPreferred mammalian host cells for expressing the recombinant antibodies of the invention include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO cells) (including dhfr-CHO cells, described in Urlaub and Chasin, (1980) Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216-4220, used with a DHFR selectable marker, e. g., as described in R. J. Kaufman and P. A. Sharp (1982) MoI. Biol. 159:601-621 ), NSO myeloma cells, COS cells and SP2 cells. In particular, for use with NSO myeloma cells, another preferred expression system is the GS gene expression system disclosed in WO 87/04462, WO 89/01036 and EP 338,841. When recombinant expression vec- tors encoding antibody genes are introduced into mammalian host cells, the antibodies are produced by culturing the host cells for a period of time sufficient to allow for expression of the antibody in the host cells or, more preferably, secretion of the antibody into the culture medium in which the host cells are grown. Antibodies can be recovered from the culture medium using standard protein purification methods.\n\n\nAntibody characterization\n\n\nAfter production or purification, or as part of a screening or selection procedure, the functional characteristics of an anti-hlL20 antibody of the invention can be investigated. Functional properties of interest include, e.g., antibody binding specificity for hlL20, antibody binding to hlL20 orthologs, antibody competition with reference antibodies (such as, e.g., 5B7 and 15D2), the epitope to which the antibody binds, the affinity of the antibody-antigen interaction, antagonistic properties of the antibody, and solubility.\n\n\nThe following are brief descriptions of exemplary assays for antibody characterization. Some are further described in other sections and/or the Examples.\n\n\nBinding Assays The present invention provides for antibodies, and antigen-binding fragments, variants, and immunoconjugates thereof, that bind hlL20. Any of a wide variety of assays can be used to assess binding of an antibody to hlL20. Protocols based upon ELISAs, radioimmunoassays, Western blotting, BIACORE, and other competition assays, inter alia, are suitable for use and are well known in the art. Further, several binding assays, including competition assays, are described in the Examples.\n\n\nFor example, simple binding assays can be used, in which a test antibody is incubated in the presence of a target protein or epitope (e.g., IL20 or a portion thereof), unbound antibodies are washed off, and the presence of bound antibodies is assessed using, e.g., radiolabels, physical methods such as mass spectrometry, or direct or indirect fluorescent \n\n labels detected using, e.g., cytofluorometric analysis (e.g. FACScan). Such methods are well known to those of skill in the art. Any amount of binding above the amount seen with a control, non-specific antibody indicates that the antibody binds specifically to the target.\n\n\nIn such assays, the ability of the test antibody to bind to the target cell or protein can be compared with the ability of a (negative) control protein, e.g. an antibody raised against a structurally unrelated antigen, or a non-lg peptide or protein, to bind to the same target. Antibodies or fragments that bind to the target cells or IL20 using any suitable assay with 25%, 50%, 100%, 200%, 1000%, or higher increased affinity relative to the control protein, are said to \"specifically bind to\" or \"specifically interact with\" the target, and are preferred for use in the therapeutic methods described below. The ability of a test antibody to affect the binding of a (positive) control antibody against IL20, e.g. 15D2 or 5B7, may also be assessed.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides for anti-hlL20 antibodies sharing biological characteristics and/or substantial VH and/or VL sequence identity with 15D2 or 5B7. One exemplary biological characteristic is the binding to the 15D2 or 5B7 epitope, or the respec- tive regions in the extracellular domain of hlL20 to which the 15D2 or 5B7 antibodies bind. To screen for antibodies that bind to the 15D2 or 5B7 epitope, a routine cross-blocking assay, such as that described in Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed.\n\n\nIn an exemplary cross-blocking or competition assay, 15D2 or 5B7 (control) anti- body and a test antibody are admixed (or pre-adsorbed) and applied to a sample containing IL20. In certain embodiments, one would pre-mix the control antibodies with varying amounts of the test antibody (e.g., 1 :10 or 1 :100) for a period of time prior to applying to the IL20- containing sample. In other embodiments, the control and varying amounts of test antibody can simply be admixed during exposure to the antigen/target sample. As long as one can distinguish bound from free antibodies (e.g., by using separation or washing techniques to eliminate unbound antibodies) and the control antibody from test antibody (e.g., by using species- or isotype-specific secondary antibodies, by specifically labeling the control antibody with a detectable label, or by using physical methods such as mass spectrometry to distinguish between different compounds) one will be able to determine if the test antibody re- duces the binding of the control antibody to the antigen, indicating that the test antibody recognizes substantially the same epitope as the control. In this assay, the binding of the (labeled) control antibody in the presence of a completely irrelevant antibody is the control high value. The control low value is be obtained by incubating the labeled (positive) control antibody with unlabeled control antibody, where competition would occur and reduce binding of the labeled antibody. \n\n In a test assay, a significant reduction in labeled antibody reactivity in the presence of a test antibody is indicative of a test antibody that competes with, or substantially binds to the same epitope, as the control antibody. Any test antibody or compound that reduces the binding of the labeled control to the antigen/target by at least 50% or more preferably 70%, at any ratio of controktest antibody or compound between about 1 :10 and about 1 :100 is considered to be an antibody or compound that competes with or binds to substantially the same epitope or determinant as the control. Preferably, such test antibody or compound will reduce the binding of the control to the antigen/target by at least 90%. Nevertheless, any compound or antibody that reduces the binding of a control antibody or compound to any measurable extent can be used in the present invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, competition can be assessed by a flow cytometry test. Cells bearing hlL20 are incubated first with a control antibody that is known to specifically bind to hlL20receptor, and then with the test antibody which may be labelled with, e.g., a fluoro- chrome or biotin. The test antibody is said to compete with the control if the binding obtained with preincubation with saturating amounts of control antibody is 80%, preferably, 50, 40 or less of the binding (mean of fluorescence) obtained by the antibody without preincubation with the control. Alternatively, a test antibody is said to compete with the control if the binding obtained with a labeled control (by a fluorochrome or biotin) on cells preincubated with saturating amount of antibody to test is 80%, preferably 50%, 40%, or less of the binding ob- tained without preincubation with the antibody. See Example 4 for an exemplary antibody competition assay.\n\n\nFunctional assays\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention are capable of reducing IL20-mediated activation of IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor complexes in vitro and/or in vivo. Various suit- able assays are known in the art.\n\n\nFor example, the Examples describe a luciferase assay that detects receptor complex activation based on the following principles. Briefly, upon IL20 binding and receptor complex formation, the associated JAK kinases are autophosphorylated and can phosphory- late STAT3 protein. Phosphorylated STAT3 can enter the nucleus and bind a specific DNA element of the promoter that has been placed next to a gene encoding luciferase. Luciferase is then expressed, and can transform the substrate luciferin to light, which can then be detected and quantified.\n\n\nAnother type of in vitro assay for testing of IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor activation is based on proliferation of, e.g., BaF-3 cells transfected with IL20 receptor complexes from humans or other species. Such an assay can test for a neutralizing effect of \n\n IL20-induced proliferation of BaF-3 cells transfected with, e.g., hlL20R1/hlL20R2 or hlL22R1/hll_20R2. The BaF-3 cells are IL3 dependent, and proliferate in vitro after the addition of IL3 in their growth medium. If IL3 is not available, the cells will die within a few days, showing signs of apoptosis already after a few hours of IL3 starvation. When the transfected BaF-3 cells are stimulated through their IL20 receptor complex, they will start to divide and do not need IL3. Specific assays for inhibition of proliferation are described in the Examples, Solubility assays\n\n\nSuitable assays for testing the solubility, i.e., the concentration of antibody that can be achieved in a solution, are described in Example 3 and in Harris, E.L.V. (1989) In Harris, E.L.V. and Angal,S. (eds), Protein Purification Methods. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York, see, e.g., pp. 131-133.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Formulations\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the present invention provides pharmaceutical composition comprising anti-hlL20 antibodies as described herein together with one or more carriers. The human antibodies of the invention, including 15D2 and 5B7, are suitable for pharmaceutical formulations, where a high concentration is often advantageous or necessary, e.g., when used for subcutaneous administration.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical formulations and administration modes described in WO2006003179, hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties, can also be used for the antibodies and applications of the present invention.\n\n\nOne object of the invention is to provide a pharmaceutical formulation comprising an antibody of the invention which is present in a concentration from 1 mg/ml to 150 mg/ml, from 1 mg/ml to 200 mg/ml, or from 1 mg/ml to 500 mg/ml, typically in an aqueous or freeze-dried formulation (for reconstitution), and wherein said formulation has a pH from 2.0 to 10.0, typi- cally around neutral pH. Preferably, in an aqueous formulation, the antibody is present in soluble form at concentrations of least about 50 mg/ml, at least about 60 mg/ml, at least about 70 mg/ml, at least about 80 mg/ml, at least about 90 mg/ml, or at least about 100 mg/ml. The formulation may further comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable ex- cipients, diluents, and/or carriers. These may include, e.g., a buffer system, as well as one or more preservatives, tonicity agents, chelating agents, stabilizers and/or surfactants. Suitable carriers are known in the art and described in, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19\nth\n edition, 1995.\n\n\nSuitable antibody formulations can also be determined by examining experiences with other already developed therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Several monoclonal anti- \n\n bodies have been shown to be efficient in clinical situations, such as Rituxan (Rituximab), Herceptin (Trastuzumab) Xolair (Omalizumab), Bexxar (Tositumomab), Campath (Alemtuzumab), Zevalin, Oncolym, Humira and similar formulations may be used with the antibodies of this invention. For example, a monoclonal antibody can be supplied at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in either 100 mg (10 ml.) or 500 mg (50 ml.) single-use vials, formulated for IV administration in 9.0 mg/mL sodium chloride, 7.35 mg/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, 0.7 mg/mL polysorbate 80, and sterile water for injection. The pH is adjusted to 6.5. Alternatively, the antibody can be formulated in a solution comprising a phosphate buffer, or his- tidine, sucrose, and Polysorbate 80.\n\n\nDiagnostic applications\n\n\nThe hlL20-antibodies of the invention also have non-therapeutic applications. For example, anti-hlL20 antibodies may also be useful in diagnostic assays for IL20 protein, e.g. detecting its presence in specific tissues, tissue samples (e.g., synovial fluid) or in serum.\n\n\nFor diagnostic applications, the antibody typically will be labelled with a detectable moiety. Numerous labels are available that can be generally grouped into the following categories:\n\n\n(a) Radioisotopes, such as \n35\nS, \n14\nC, \n125\n1, \n3\nH, and \n131\nI. The antibody can be labeled with the radioisotope using the techniques described in Current Protocols in Immunology, Volumes 1 and 2, Coligen et al., Ed. Wiley-lnterscience, New York, N.Y., Pubs. (1991 ), for example, and radioactivity can be measured using scintillation counting.\n\n\n(b) Fluorescent labels such as rare-earth chelates (europium chelates) or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, Lissamine, phycoerythrin and Texas Red are available. The fluorescent labels can be conjugated to the antibody using the techniques disclosed in Current Protocols in Immunology, supra, for example. Fluores- cence can be quantified using a fluorimeter.\n\n\n(c) Various enzyme-substrate labels are available and U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149 provides a review of some of these. The enzyme generally catalyzes a chemical alteration of the chromogenic substrate that can be measured using various techniques. For example, the enzyme may catalyze a color change in a substrate, which can be measured spectropho- tometrically. Alternatively, the enzyme may alter the fluorescence or chemiluminescence of the substrate. Examples of enzymatic labels include luciferases (e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase; U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, malate dehydrogenase, urease, peroxidase such as horseradish peroxidase (HRPO), alkaline phosphatase, beta-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases (e.g., glucose \n\n oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), heterocyclic oxidases (such as uricase and xanthine oxidase), lactoperoxidase, microperoxidase, and the like. Techniques for conjugating enzymes to antibodies are described in O'Sullivan et al, \"Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme-Antibody Conjugates for use in Enzyme Immunoas- say,\" in Methods in Enzymology (Ed., J. Langone & H. Van Vunakis), Academic Press, New York, 73:147-166 (1981 ).\n\n\nThe antibodies may also be used for in vivo diagnostic assays. Generally, the antibody is labeled with a radionuclide or a non-radioactive indicator detectable by, e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance, or other means known in the art. Preferably, the label is a radiolabel, such as, e.g., \n125\n1, \n131\n1, \n67\nCu, \n99m\nTc, or \n111\nIn. The labelled antibody is administered to a host, preferably via the bloodstream, and the presence and location of the labelled antibody in the host is assayed. This imaging technique is suitably used in the detection, staging, or treatment of the diseases or disorders in question, for example, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Sjogren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus and/or lupus nephritis, by visualisation of IL20 in synovial fluids and -membranes. The radioisotope is conjugated to the protein by any means, including metal-chelating compounds iodogen techniques for iodination.\n\n\nAs a matter of convenience, the antibodies of the present invention can be provided in a kit, i.e., a packaged combination of reagents in predetermined amounts with instructions for performing the diagnostic assay. Where the antibody is labelled with an enzyme, the kit will include substrates and cofactors required by the enzyme (e.g., a substrate precursor that provides the detectable chromophore or fluorophore). In addition, other additives may be included such as stabilizers, buffers (e.g., a block buffer or lysis buffer) and the like. The rela- tive amounts of the various reagents may be varied widely to provide for concentrations in solution of the reagents that substantially optimize the sensitivity of the assay. Particularly, the reagents may be provided as dry powders, usually lyophilized, including excipients that on dissolution will provide a reagent solution having the appropriate concentration.\n\n\nTherapeutic applications Methods of treating a patient using a human or humanized anti-hlL20 antibody as described herein are also provided for by the present invention. In one embodiment, the invention provides for the use of a human or humanized antibody as described herein in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for administration to a human patient. Typically, the patient suffers from, or is at risk for, an autoimmune or inflammatory disease or disorder. \n\n In one aspect, the conditions or disorders to be treated with the antibodies and other compounds of the invention are rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Sjogren's syndrome, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, systemic lupus erythema- tosus, or lupus nephritis, and any combination thereof, as well as co-morbidities associated with these diseases, with cardiovascular disease being a non-limiting example of said comorbidities. In a further aspect, other exemplary conditions include, but are not limited to, juvenile chronic arthritis, osteoarthritis, other spondyloarthropathies than ankylosing spondylitis, systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (dermatomyositis, polymyositis), vasculitis, systemic vasculitis, temporal arteritis, atherosclerosis, sarcoidosis, myasthenia gravis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (immune pancytopenia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria), pernicious anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia), thyroiditis (Grave's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, juvenile lymphocytic thyroiditis, atrophic thyroiditis), diabetes mellitus, Type 2 diabetes, immune-mediated renal disease (glomerulonephritis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, autoimmune oophiritis), pancreatitis, autoimmune orchitis, autoimmune uveitis, anti- phospholipid syndrome, demyelinating diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems in addition to multiple sclerosis, idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy or Guillain- Barre syndrome, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, hepatobiliary dis- eases such as infectious hepatitis (hepatitis A, B. C, D, E and other non-hepatotropic viruses), autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, viral hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, granulomatous hepatitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, Behcet's disease, and sclerosing cholangitis, inflammatory bowel diseases such as celiac disease, gluten-sensitive enteropathy, and Whipple's disease, autoimmune or immune-mediated skin diseases including bullous skin diseases, erythema multiforme and contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, dermitis herpetiformis, pemphigus vulgaris, vitiligo (leukoderma), allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, food hypersensitivity and urticaria, sepsis, endotoxemia, immunologic diseases of the lung such as eosinophilic pneumonias, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and organ or bone marrow transplantation associated diseases including graft rejection and graft-versus-host- disease.\n\n\nFor example, in one aspect, the anti-IL20 antibody is used in combination with one or more other anti-inflammatory agents, including, but not limited to, analgesic agents, immunosuppressive agents (e.g., B- or T-cell antagonists such as B-cell depletion agents and T cell inhibiting agents; complement inhibiting agents), corticosteroids, and anti-TNFalpha \n\n agents or other anti-cytokine or anti-cytokine receptor agents, and anti-angiogenic agents. Specific examples include metothrexate, TSG-6, Rituxan® or other B-cell therapies, anti-IL12 antibodies, CTLA4-Fc fusion proteins, I L1 -receptor antagonists, IL1 antibodies, IL15 antibodies, IL18 antibodies, and anti-IL6R antibodies. Further examples of combination therapies are provided below.\n\n\nWhen one or more other agents or approaches are used in combination with the present therapy, there is no requirement for the combined results to be additive of the effects observed when each treatment is conducted separately. Although at least additive effects are generally desirable, any decrease in IL20 activity or other beneficial effect above one of the single therapies would be of benefit. Also, there is no particular requirement for the combined treatment to exhibit synergistic effects, although this is certainly possible and advantageous. The IL20-based treatment may precede, or follow, the other treatment by, e.g., intervals ranging from minutes to weeks and months. It also is envisioned that more than one administration of either the anti-IL20 composition or the other agent will be utilized. The agents may be administered interchangeably, on alternate days or weeks; or a cycle of anti-IL20 treatment may be given, followed by a cycle of the other agent therapy. In any event, all that is required is to deliver both agents in a combined amount effective to exert a therapeutically beneficial effect, irrespective of the times for administration. Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease that mainly involves the synovial membrane of multiple joints with resultant injury to the articular cartilage. The pathogenesis is T lymphocyte dependent and is associated with the production of rheumatoid factors, auto antibodies directed against self IgG, with the resultant formation of immune complexes that attain high levels in joint fluid and blood. These com- plexes in the joint may induce the marked infiltrate of lymphocytes and monocytes into the synovium and subsequent marked synovial changes; the joint space is infiltrated by similar cells with the addition of numerous neutrophils. Tissues affected are primarily the joints, often in symmetrical pattern. However, extra-articular disease also occurs in two major forms. One form is the development of extra-articular lesions with ongoing progressive joint disease and typical lesions of pulmonary fibrosis, vasculitis, and cutaneous ulcers. The second form of extra-articular disease is the so called Felty's syndrome which occurs late in the RA disease course, sometimes after joint disease has become quiescent, and involves the presence of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and splenomegaly. This can be accompanied by vasculitis in multiple organs with formations of infarcts, skin ulcers and gangrene. Patients often also de- velop rheumatoid nodules in the subcutis tissue overlying affected joints; the nodules late \n\n stage have necrotic centers surrounded by a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate. Other manifestations which can occur in RA include: pericarditis, pleuritis, coronary arteritis, intestitial pneumonitis with pulmonary fibrosis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and rheumatoid nodules. IL20 has been demonstrated in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid (Hsu et al. (2006) Arthritis Rheum. 54, 2722-2733; Kragstrup et al., (2008) Cytokine 41 , 16-23), and IL20 receptor expression has been demonstrated in rheumatoid arthritis synovium (Hsu et al., (2006) Arthritis Rheum. 54, 2722-2733; Sakurai et al., (2008) Rheumatology (Oxford) 47, 815-820).\n\n\nAccordingly, in one aspect, the invention provides a method for treating and/or preventing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The method comprises delivering an effective amount of an anti-hlL20 antibody to a patient having RA or being identified/diagnosed as being at substantial risk of developing RA, such that RA is treated or prevented. In a further aspect, the antibody that is capable of detectably reducing IL20-mediated activation of IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor complexes. In one aspect, the method results in a modulation of one or more biomarkers in a manner consistent with the treatment or prevention (as applicable) of RA (e.g., serum IL-6, TNF-α, IL1 , VEGF, TIFF R, IL2R, shed CD4, shed CD8, and/or C reactive protein). In vivo models of RA in which the antibodies of the invention can optionally be tested are described in US Patent No. 6,414,218 and US Patent Publication No. 20030005469 (related principles and models are described in, e.g., Wooley, P. H., Animal Models of Arthritis, eds. J. H. Klippel and P. A. Dieppe, Mosby Publishers (London), 1998; Erning et al., Arthritis Res, 4 Suppl 3:S 133-40, 2002; Holmdahl et al., Ageing Res Rev, 1 (1 ): 135-47, 2002; Anthony et al., Clin Exp Rheumatol, 17(2) :240-4,1999; Durie et al., Clin Immunol Immunopathol, 73(1 ):11-8, 1994; and Muller-Ladner et al., Drugs Today (Bare), 35(4- 5):379-88, 1999).\n\n\nIn another aspect, the practice of the method results in a detectable reduction of synovial inflammation in the peripheral joints of the patient/host. In one aspect, the method results in preventing radiographic deterioration and improving physical function in the patient or host as exhibited by, e.g., a reduction in radiographic progression in the patient or host, reduction in swollen and tender joints (as determined by acceptable analytical criteria), and/or significantly improved quality of life (e.g., as determined by a reduction in disability scores on the RA Health Assessment Questionnaire). The antibody can be used alone or in combination with one or more other anti-RA agent, such as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), a COX-2 inhibitor, an analgesic, a corticosteroid (e.g., predinisone, hydrocortisone), gold, an immunosuppressant (e.g., methotrexate), a B-cell depletion agent (e.g., Ri- tuxan®), a B-cell agonist (e.g., Lymph oStat-B®) and an anti-TNFalpha agent (e.g., Embrel®, \n\n Humira® and Remicade®), an anti-IL1 receptor antagonist (e.g., Kineret®), an anti-IL15 antibody, or a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD). Demyelinating diseases\n\n\nDemyelinating diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems, including Multiple Sclerosis (MS); idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy or Guillain-Barre syndrome; and Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy, are believed to have an autoimmune basis and result in nerve demyelination as a result of damage caused to oligodendrocytes or to myelin directly. In MS there is evidence to suggest that disease induction and progression is dependent on T lymphocytes. MS is a demyelinating disease that is T lym- phocyte-dependent and has either a relapsing-remitting course or a chronic progressive course. The etiology is unknown; however, viral infections, genetic predisposition, environment, and autoimmunity all contribute. Lesions contain infiltrates of predominantly T lymphocyte mediated, microglial cells and infiltrating macrophages; CD4+ T lymphocytes are the predominant cell type at lesions. Thus, in another aspect, the invention provides a method for treating and/or preventing MS. The method comprises delivering an effective amount of an anti-hlL20 antibody to a human patient having MS or being identified/diagnosed as being at substantial risk of developing MS, such that MS is treated or prevented in the patient or host. The antibody can be used alone or in combination with other anti-MS agents such as Tyzabri®. Inflammatory bowel disease\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides a method for treating and/or preventing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.\n\n\nThe method of treating an inflammatory bowel disease comprises delivering an effective amount of an anti-IL20 antibody to a human patient having IBD or being identi- fied/diagnosed as being at substantial risk of developing IBD, such that IBD is treated or prevented in the patient. The antibody can be used alone or in combination with other anti-IBD agents, such as drugs containing mesalamine (including sulfasalazine and other agents containing 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), such as olsalazine and balsalazide), non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, corticosteroids (e.g., predinisone, hydrocortisone), TNF-inhibitors (including adilimumab (Humira®, etanercept (Enbrel® and infliximab (Remicade®), anti-IL12 antibodies, immunosuppressants (such as 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine and cyclosporine A), and antibiotics. Psoriasis\n\n\nPsoriasis is a T lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory disease. Lesions contain infil- trates of T lymphocytes, macrophages and antigen processing cells, and some neutrophils. \n\n IL20 and its receptors are present in elevated levels in psoriatic lesions (Wei et al., Clin Immunol (2005) 1 17: 65-72; Rømer et al., J Invest Dermatol 2003; 121 , 1306-131 1 ; Wang et al., J Invest Dermatol 2006; 126: 1590-1599; Otkjaer et al., Br J Dermatol 2005; 153: 91 1- 918). Thus, in another aspect, the invention provides a method for treating and/or preventing psoriasis. The method comprises delivering an effective amount of an anti-hlL20 antibody to a human patient having psoriasis or being identified/diagnosed as being at substantial risk of developing psoriasis, such that psoriasis is treated or prevented in the patient. The antibody can be used alone or in combination with one or more other anti-psoriasis treatments such as phototherapy, topical therapy (e.g., tar, topical glucocorticoids), or systemic therapy (e.g., methotrexate, a synthetic retinoid, cyclosporine), an anti-TNFalpha agent (e.g., Em- brel®, Humira®, Remicade®), a T-cell inhibitor (e.g., Raptiva®), vitamin D analogs, p38 mi- togen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors, as well as a biologic agent such as Ri- tuxan®. Psoriatic arthritis\n\n\nPsoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory arthritic condition affecting the skin, the joints, the insertion sites of tendons, ligaments, and fascia, and is commonly associated with psoriasis. (Approximately 7% of patients with psoriasis develop psoriatic arthritis). Much evidence suggests that a T-cell-mediated process drives the pathophysiology of psoriatic arthri- tis. Monocytes also play a role in psoriatic arthritis and are responsible for the production of matrix metalloproteinases, which may mediate the destructive changes in the joints of patients with psoriatic arthritis.\n\n\nThus, in another aspect, the invention provides a method for treating and/or preventing psoriatic arthritis. The method comprises delivering an effective amount of an anti-hlL20 antibody to a human patient having psoriatic arthritis or being identified/diagnosed as being at substantial risk of developing psoriatic arthritis, such that the psoriatic arthritis is treated or prevented in the patient. The antibody can be used alone or in combination with one or more other anti-psoriatic arthritis treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin, ibuprofen), methotrexate, a synthetic retinoid, cyclosporine, a corticosteroid, an anti- TNFalpha agent (e.g., Embrel®, Humira®, Remicade®). Systemic lupus erythematosus\n\n\nIn systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the central mediator of disease is the production of auto-reactive antibodies to self proteins/tissues and the subsequent generation of immune-mediated inflammation. Antibodies either directly or indirectly mediate tissue injury. Though T lymphocytes have not been shown to be directly involved in tissue damage, T \n\n lymphocytes are required for the development of auto-reactive antibodies. The genesis of the disease is thus T lymphocyte dependent. Multiple organs and systems are affected clinically including kidney, lung, musculoskeletal system, mucocutaneous, eye, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow and blood. Thus, in another aspect, the invention provides a method for treating and/or preventing SLE. The method comprises delivering an effective amount of an anti-hlL20 antibody to a human patient having SLE or being identified/diagnosed as being at substantial risk of developing SLE, such that the SLE is treated or prevented in the patient.The antibody can be used alone or in combination with other anti-SLE agents, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), analgesics, corticosteroids (e.g., predinisone, hydrocortisone), immunosuppressants (such as cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, and methotrexate), antimalarials (such as hydroxychloroquine) and biologic drugs that inhibit the production of dsDNA antibodies (e.g. LIP 394).\n\n\nDiabetes Type I diabetes mellitus or insulin-dependent diabetes is the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet B cells; this destruction is mediated by auto-antibodies and autoreactive T cells. Antibodies to insulin or the insulin receptor can also produce the phenotype of insulin-non-responsiveness.\n\n\nThus, in another aspect, an anti-IL20 antibody is delivered to a patient suffering from or at substantial risk of developing type I diabetes mellitus in an amount and under conditions sufficient to treat or prevent the condition in the patient. The antibody can be used alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic agents, such as insulin, or beta cell growth or survival factors, or immunomodulatory antibodies such as anti-CD3 antibodies. Transplantation Transplantation associated diseases, including graft rejection and Graft-Versus-\n\n\nHost-Disease (GVHD), is T lymphocyte-dependent; inhibition of T lymphocyte function is ameliorative.\n\n\nThus, in another aspect, the invention provides methods of reducing the likelihood of transplant rejection (or reducing the severity or prolonging the time to onset of a transplant rejection-related condition, i.e., to prolong allograft survival). The method comprises delivering an effective amount of an anti-hlL20 antibody to a human patient that is about to be, is, or recently was the recipient of a tissue/organ transplant, such that the likelihood of rejection is detectably reduced (e.g., as compared to a control). Examples of tissue transplants that can be treated include, but are not limited to, liver, lung, kidney, heart, small bowel, and pancre- atic islet cells, as well as in bone marrow-transplantation and in the treatment of graft versus \n\n host disease (GVHD). The antibody can be used alone or in combination with other agents for inhibiting transplant rejection, such as immunosuppressive agents (e.g. cyclosporine, azathioprine, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, sirilimus, rapamycin, tacrolimus), anti-infective agents (e.g., acyclovir, clotrimazole, ganci- clovir, nystatin, trimethoprimsulfarnethoxazole), diuretics (e.g. bumetanide, furosemide, me- tolazone) and ulcer medications (e.g., cimetidine, famotidine, lansoprazole, omeprazole, ranitidine, sucralfate). For hematopoietic transplantation, hematopoietic growth factor(s) (e.g., erythropoietin, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL3, IL1 1 , thrombopoietin, etc.) or antimicrobial(s) (e.g., antibiotic, antiviral, antifungal) may be administered as an adjunct therapy. Other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases\n\n\nIn other separate aspects, the invention provides methods for treating and/or preventing other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases or disorders, comprising delivering an effective amount of an anti-hlL20 antibody to a human patient having the disease or disorder or being identified/diagnosed as being at substantial risk of developing the disease or disor- der, such that it is treated or prevented in the patient, where the disease or disorder is one described below. The antibody can be used alone or in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents used for treating the disease or disorder.\n\n\nJuvenile chronic arthritis is a chronic idiopathic inflammatory disease which begins often at less than 16 years of age. Its phenotype has some similarities to RA; some patients which are rhematoid factor positive are classified as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The disease is sub-classified into three major categories: pauciarticular, polyarticular, and systemic. The arthritis can be severe and is typically destructive and leads to joint ankylosis and retarded growth. Other manifestations can include chronic anterior uveitis and systemic amyloidosis. Spondyloarthropathies are a group of disorders with some common clinical features and the common association with the expression of HLA-B27 gene product. The disorders include: ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter's syndrome (reactive arthritis), arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease, spondylitis associated with psoriasis, juvenile onset spondyloarthropathy and undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy. Distinguishing features include sac- roileitis with or without spondylitis; inflammatory asymmetric arthritis; association with HLA- B27 (a serologically defined allele of the HLA-B locus of class I MHC); ocular inflammation, and absence of autoantibodies associated with other rheumatoid disease. The cell most implicated as key to induction of the disease is the CD8+ T lymphocyte, a cell which targets antigen presented by class I MHC molecules. CD8+ T cells may react against the class I MHC allele HLA B27 as if it were a foreign peptide expressed by MHC class I molecules. It \n\n has been hypothesized that an epitope of HLA-B27 may mimic a bacterial or other microbial antigenic epitope and thus induces a CD8+ T cells response.\n\n\nSystemic sclerosis (scleroderma) has an unknown etiology. A hallmark of the disease is induration of the skin; likely this is induced by an active inflammatory process. Scleroderma can be localized or systemic; vascular lesions are common and endothelial cell injury in the microvasculature is an early and important event in the development of systemic sclerosis; the vascular injury may be immune mediated. An immunologic basis is implied by the presence of mononuclear cell infiltrates in the cutaneous lesions and the presence of anti-nuclear antibodies in many patients. ICAM-1 is often unregulated on the cell surface of fibroblasts in skin lesions suggesting that T cell interaction with these cells may have a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Other organs involved include: the gastrointestinal tract: smooth muscle atrophy and fibrosis resulting in abnormal peristalsis/motility; kidney: concentric subendothelial intimal proliferation affecting small arcuate and interlobular arteries with resultant reduced renal cortical blood flow, results in proteinuria, azotemia and hypertension; skeletal muscle: atrophy, interstitial fibrosis; inflammation; lung: interstitial pneumonitis and interstitial fibrosis; and heart: contraction band necrosis, scarring/fibrosis.\n\n\nIdiopathic inflammatory myopathies including dermatomyositis, polymyositis and others are disorders of chronic muscle inflammation of unknown etiology resulting in muscle weakness. Muscle injury/inflammation is often symmetric and progressive. Autoantibodies are associated with most forms. These myositis-specific autoantibodies are directed against and inhibit the function of components, proteins and RNA's, involved in protein synthesis.\n\n\nSjogren's syndrome is due to immune-mediated inflammation and subsequent functional destruction of the tear glands and salivary glands. The disease can be associated with or accompanied by inflammatory connective tissue diseases. The disease is associated with autoantibody production against Ro and La antigens, both of which are small RNA-protein complexes. Lesions result in keratoconjunctivitis sicca, xerostomia, with other manifestations or associations including bilary cirrhosis, peripheral or sensory neuropathy, and palpable purpura.\n\n\nSystemic vasculitis are diseases in which the primary lesion is inflammation and subsequent damage to blood vessels which results in ischemia/necrosis/degeneration to tissues supplied by the affected vessels and eventual end-organ dysfunction in some cases. Vasculitides can also occur as a secondary lesion or sequelae to other immune-inflammatory mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, etc., particularly in diseases also associated with the formation of immune complexes. Diseases in the primary sys- temic vasculitis group include: systemic necrotizing vasculitis: polyarteritis nodosa, allergic \n\n angiitis and granulomatosis, polyangiitis; Wegener's granulomatosis; lymphomatoid granulomatosis; and giant cell arteritis. Miscellaneous vasculitides include: mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (MLNS or Kawasaki's disease), isolated CNS vasculitis, Behet's disease, thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease) and cutaneous necrotizing venulitis. The pathogenic mechanism of most of the types of vasculitis listed is believed to be primarily due to the deposition of immunoglobulin complexes in the vessel wall and subsequent induction of an inflammatory response either via ADCC, complement activation, or both.\n\n\nSarcoidosis is a condition of unknown etiology which is characterized by the presence of epithelioid granulomas in nearly any tissue in the body; involvement of the lung is most common. The pathogenesis involves the persistence of activated macrophages and lymphoid cells at sites of the disease with subsequent chronic sequelae resultant from the release of locally and systemically active products released by these cell types.\n\n\nAutoimmune hemolytic anemia including autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune pancytopenia, and paroxysmal noctural hemoglobinuria is a result of production of antibodies that react with antigens expressed on the surface of red blood cells (and in some cases other blood cells including platelets as well) and is a reflection of the removal of those antibody coated cells via complement mediated lysis and/or ADCC/Fc-receptor-mediated mechanisms.\n\n\nIn autoimmune thrombocytopenia including thrombocytopenic purpura, and immune- mediated thrombocytopenia in other clinical settings, platelet destruction/removal occurs as a result of either antibody or complement attaching to platelets and subsequent removal by complement lysis, ADCC or Fc-receptor mediated mechanisms.\n\n\nThyroiditis including Grave's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, juvenile lymphocytic thyroiditis, and atrophic thyroiditis, are the result of an autoimmune response against thyroid antigens with production of antibodies that react with proteins present in and often specific for the thyroid gland. Experimental models exist including spontaneous models: rats (BUF and BB rats) and chickens (obese chicken strain); inducible models: immunization of animals with either thyroglobulin, thyroid microsomal antigen (thyroid peroxidase).\n\n\nImmune mediated renal diseases, including glomerulonephritis and tubulointerstitial nephritis, are the result of antibody or T lymphocyte mediated injury to renal tissue either directly as a result of the production of autoreactive antibodies or T cells against renal antigens or indirectly as a result of the deposition of antibodies and/or immune complexes in the kidney that are reactive against other, non-renal antigens. Thus other immune-mediated diseases that result in the formation of immune-complexes can also induce immune mediated renal disease as an indirect sequelae. Both direct and indirect immune mechanisms result in \n\n inflammatory response that produces/induces lesion development in renal tissues with resultant organ function impairment and in some cases progression to renal failure. Both humoral and cellular immune mechanisms can be involved in the pathogenesis of lesions.\n\n\nInflammatory and Fibrotic Lung Disease, including Eosinophilic Pneumonias; Idio- pathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis may involve a disregulated immune-inflammatory response. Inhibition of such a response would be of therapeutic benefit.\n\n\nAutoimmune or Immune-mediated Skin Disease including Bullous Skin Diseases, Erythema Multiforme, and Contact Dermatitis are mediated by auto-antibodies, the genesis of which is T lymphocyte dependent. Allergic diseases, including asthma; allergic rhinitis; atopic dermatitis; food hypersensitivity; and urticaria are T lymphocyte dependent. These diseases are predominantly mediated by T lymphocyte induced inflammation, IgE mediated-inflammation or a combination of both.\n\n\nIt will be understood that the effective amount of the IL20 antibody, as well as the overall dosage regimen, may vary according to the disease and the patient's clinical status, which, in turn, may be reflected in one or more clinical parameters such as clinically accepted disease scores. For example, for rheumatoid arthritis, the severity of disease and/or outcome of treatment may be evaluated by monitoring number of swollen joints; pain; mobility; and/or the official disease score ACR 20/50 or 70. For Type 1 diabetes, severity of dis- ease and/or outcome of treatment may be evaluated by measuring blood glucose levels or variations thereof, HbIC levels, the amount of insulin needed, and the like. For multiple sclerosis, brain inflammation can be assessed through scanning the brain. For hematopoietic transplant rejection, severity of the disease (failure to engraft) and/or outcome of treatment may be evaluated by evidence of prolonged neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and red-cell transfusion dependence in patients that have undergone myeloablative conditioning, and by failure to observe chimerism in patients that have undergone non-myeloablative conditioning. In general, detectable effects on treatment outcome using the methods and compositions of the present invention include a decrease in the necessity for other treatments (including, e.g., a decrease in the amount and/or duration of other drugs or treatments), a decrease in num- ber and/or duration of hospital stays, a decrease in lost work days due to illness, and the like. It will be further understood that the effective amount may be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art by routine experimentation, by constructing a matrix of values and testing different points in the matrix. \n\n Dosages\n\n\nFor administration of the antibody, the dosage ranges from about 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg, and more usually 0.01 to 5 mg/kg, of the host body weight. For example, dosages can be about 0.3 mg/kg body weight, about 1 mg/kg body weight, about 3 mg/kg body weight, about 5 mg/kg body weight or about 10 mg/kg body weight or within the range of 1- 10 mg/kg. An exemplary treatment regime entails administration twice per week, once per week, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, once every four weeks, once a month, once every 3 months or once every three to 6 months. Exemplary dosage regimens for an anti-hlL20 antibody of the invention include about 1 , 3 or 10 mg/kg body weight body weight via intravenous administration or subcutaneous injection, with the antibody being given using one of the following dosing schedules: (i) loading doses every 1-3 weeks for 2-4 dosages, then every two months; (ii) every four weeks; (iii) every week, or any other optimal dosing. In some methods, two or more monoclonal antibodies with different binding specificities are administered simultaneously, in which case the dosage of each antibody adminis- tered falls within the ranges indicated. Antibody is usually administered on multiple occasions. Intervals between single dosages can be, for example, weekly, monthly, every three months or yearly. Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring blood levels of antibody to the target antigen in the patient. In some methods, dosage is adjusted to achieve a plasma antibody concentration of about 1-1000 μg /ml and in some methods about 25-300 μg/ml. The antibody can alternatively be administered as a sustained release formulation, in which case less frequent administration is required. Dosage and frequency vary depending on the half-life of the antibody in the patient. In general, human antibodies show the longest half life, followed by humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, and nonhuman antibodies. The dosage and frequency of administration can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. In prophylactic applications, a relatively low dosage is administered at relatively infrequent intervals over a long period of time. Some patients continue to receive treatment for the rest of their lives. In therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated, and preferably until the patient shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patient can be administered a prophylactic regime. As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art, the appropriate doses of anti-cancer agents will approximate those already employed in clinical therapies wherein the anti-cancer agents are administered alone or in combination with other agents. Variation in dosage will likely occur depending on the condition being treated. The physician administer- ing treatment will be able to determine the appropriate dose for the individual subject. \n\n Articles of manufacture\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided. For example, the article of manufacture can comprise a container containing a human or humanized anti-hlL20 antibody as described herein together with instructions directing a user to treat a disorder such as an autoimmune or inflammatory disease or disorder in a human with the antibody in an effective amount.

Material & Methods\n\n\nMedia and Buffers. Culture medium: Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI 1640) with Glutamax, 10% heat inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) (BioWhitaker Cat.No. DE17-602E), 1 mg/ml Geneticin (GIBCO Cat.No. 10131-019), 200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen 45-0430), 1 ng/ml murine IL-3 (TriChem ApS Cat.No. 213-13), 50 μM 2-Mercapto-ethanol (Gibco Cat.No. 31350-010). Assay medium: RPMI 1640 with Glutamax, 10% heat inactivated FBS, 1 % P/S (BioWhitaker Cat.No. DE17-602E), 1 mg/ml Geneticin (GIBCO Cat.No. 10131-019), 200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen 45-0430), 50 μM 2- Mercapto-ethanol (Gibco Cat.No. 31350-010). AlamarBlue dye: (BioScource, DaIHOO) was used to assess proliferation. The fluorescence intensity was measured on a spectrofluorome- ter (bmg POLARstar+ Galaxy) at excitation 555-12nm and emission 590nm.\n\n\nAntibodies, Cells and Cytokines. Mice were immunized by injecting subcutaneously 20 μg of human IL-20 in FCA followed by two injections with 20 μg of hlL20 in FIA. High- responder mice were boosted intravenuosly with 25 μg of hlL20 and the spleens were harvested after 3 days. Spleen cells were fused with the myeloma cell line (Kohler, G & Milstein C. (1976), European J. Immunology, 6:511-19). Supernatants were screened for human IL- 20 antibody production in an indirect hlL20-specific ELISA, and purified. Rabbit anti-hlL20 polyclonal antibody (pAb) was produced by immunizing rabbits four times with 50μg hlL20 at 14 days intervals and five times with 10μg/ml hlL20 once monthly. The serum was purified (2313B). BaF-3(hlL20R) cells were from a BaF-3 cell line transfected with the genes for hlL20R1 (Zcytor7) and hlL20R2 (Dirsi ) and the plasmid KZ134 that bears luciferase under control of the signal transduction and transcription protein (STAT)-promotor elements. The BaF-3 cell line was generated by selection in pyromycin (Zcytor7) and zeozin (Dirsi ) and received from Zymogenetics Institute.\n\n\nStimulation assay. An initial stimulation assay was made to assess the level of hlL20 to be used in the inhibition assay. BaF-3(hlL20R) cells were washed thoroughly in assay medium to get rid of residual IL-3. The cells were then seeded into 96-well microtiter plates (flat-well view plate Packard cat.S00190) at 10\n4\n-5x10\n4\ncel Is/well. Serial dilutions of hlL20 (10\n\"\n \n7\nM to10\n\"13\nM) were added to the wells and additional wells with cells but no hlL20 served as negative control. The cells were cultured for three days in 5% CO\n2\n at 37°C. For the last 6 hours of the culture period, 10 μl alamarBlue was added to each well. The cells were ana- \n\n lyzed for fluorescence intensity on a spectrofluorometer (bmg POLARstar+ Galaxy) at excitation 555-12 nm and emission 590 nm. For inhibition analysis, a constant concentration of IL20 was used to stimulate the cells. This concentration was chosen on basis of approximately 90% of max stimulation in the proliferation assay which in most of our assays corresponded to 10\n\"9\n M hi L20.\n\n\nInhibition assay. 1x10\n4\n-5x10\n4\ncells/well of washed BaF-3(hlL20R) cells were added to microtiter wells in assay medium and 10\n\"9\nM hlL20 (final concentration) was added to each well except for wells used as negative control containing only cells. This concentration corresponded to approx. 90% of maximum stimulation with the hlL20 cytokine. Serial dilutions of antibody (i.e., 100 μg and 2-fold dilutions) were added to the wells already containing cells and cytokines (except wells used for positive controls containing only cells + hlL20). The mixture of cells, cytokine and antibody were incubated in 100 μl/well for 72 hours in 5% CO\n2\n at 37°C. The last 6 hours of incubation included 10 μl/well of alamarBlue. The plates were analysed for fluorescence intensity on a spectrofluorometer (bmg POLARstar+ Galaxy) at excitation 555-12 nm and emission 590 nm. The curves were drawn and the potency (half maximal inhibition (IC\n50\n)) was calculated using Prism 4 (GraphPad PRISM software Inc.). Efficacy was calculated as 1- (max inhibition of antibody/(initial stimulation of cytokine - no stimulation of cytokine)) \n*\n100%.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nAn initial stimulation of BaF-3(hlL20R) at 10\n\"9\nM hlL20 was chosen from dose response curves. The results from a series of inhibition assays are shown in Table 1. The potency (IC\n50\n) varied among the different inhibitory antibodies. 15D2 was one of the most potent inhibitors, and had the lowest interassay variation. 15D2 also had a high affinity compared to the polyclonal rabbit anti-hlL20 antibody preparation.\n\n\nTable 1 - Inhibition of hlL20 induced proliferation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Comparative inhibition of IL20-, IL19- or IL24-induced proliferation\n\n\nHuman antibody 15D2 was tested for its ability to neutralize cynomolgus IL20 and mouse IL20. Both mouse and cynomolgus IL20 are able to induce proliferation in BaF- 3(hlL20R) cells. 15D2 was also tested for inhibition of proliferation induced by hlL19 or hlL24 on BaF-3(hlL20R). Both hlL24 and hlL19 bind the hlL20R1 +hlL20R2 receptor.\n\n\nMaterial & Methods\n\n\nMedia and Buffers. See Example 1.\n\n\nAntibodies, Cells and Cytokines. See Example 1. Human and cynomolgous IL20 were produced in E. coli. Mouse IL20 was from BioSource International Inc. Human IL19 and IL24 were from R&D systems.\n\n\nStimulation assay. An initial stimulation assay was made to asses the initial concentration of hlL20, cynomolgus IL20 and mouse IL20 to be used in the inhibition assay, using the same initial stimulation assay described in Example 1. Initial stimulation with hi L19 and hlL24 was assessed by the same method. It was decided to use three different initial concentrations of IL19 and hlL24 in the inhibition assay.\n\n\nInhibition Assay. (1 ) Effect on anti-hlL20 mAb on cynomolgus IL20 and mouse IL20 induced proliferation: 1x10\n4\n-5x10\n4\ncells/well of washed BaF-3(hlL20R) cells were added to microtiter wells in assay medium and, 10\n\"9\nM hlL20, cynomolgus IL20 or mouse IL20 (final concentration) was added to each well except for wells used as negative controls containing only cells. This concentration corresponded to approx. 90% of maximum stimulation with the cytokines. Serial dilutions of antibody 1400-250-15D2 (100 μg and 2-fold dilutions) were added to the wells already containing cells and cytokines (except wells used for positive controls containing only cells + cytokines).\n\n\n(2) Effect on anti-hlL20 mAb on hlL19 and hlL24 induced proliferation: 1x10\n4\n- 5x10\n4\ncells/well of washed BaF-3(hlL20R) cells were added to microtiter wells in assay medium and three different concentrations of cytokine (10\n8\nM, 10\n\"9\nM and 10\n\"10\nM final concentration) of either hlL20, hi L19 or hlL24 was added to each well, except for wells used as negative controls and containing only cells. This concentration corresponded to approximately \n\n 90% of maximum stimulation with the cytokines. Serial dilutions of antibody 15D2 (100 μg and 2-fold dilutions) were added to the wells already containing cells and cytokines (except wells used for positive controls containing only cells + cytokines).\n\n\nFor both assays, the mixture of cells, cytokine and antibody were incubated in 100 μl/well for 72 hours in 5% CO\n2\n at 37°C. The last 6 hours of incubation included 10 μl/well of alamarBlue. The plates were analysed for fluorescence intensity on a spectrofluorometer (bmg POLARstar+ Galaxy) at excitation 555-12 nm and emission 590 nm. The curves were drawn and the potency (half maximal inhibition (IC\n5\no)) was calculated using Prism 4 (Graph- Pad PRISM software Inc.). The efficacy (the percentage inhibition by antibodies) was calculated as 1- (max inhibition of antibody/(initial stimulation of cytokine - no stimulation of cytokine)) \n*\n100%.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nEffect of anti-hlL20 mAb on cynomolgus IL20 and mouse IL20 induced proliferation. When BaF-3(hlL20R) cells were stimulated with human, cynomolgus or mouse IL20, the cells proliferated and this proliferation could be inhibited by anti-hlL20 mAb 15D2 in a dose dependent manner. The efficacy of 15D2 was near 100% at 66 mM IL20 for all three cytokines. The potencies of the antibody could not be directly compared since the affinity for the hlL20R was different for the three cytokines.\n\n\nEffect of anti-hlL20 mAb on hlL19 and hlL24 induced proliferation. BaF-3(hlL20R) cells were stimulated with three different concentrations of hlL20, hlL19 or hlL24 (Figure 5). A dose-dependent response was detected for inhibition of hlL20 induced proliferation (Figure 5A). This experiment served as positive control for the subsequent hlL19 and hlL24 experiments. When the BaF-3(hlL20R) cells initially were stimulated with hi L19, 15D2 was not able to inhibit the proliferation regardless of which of the three initial concentrations of hi L19 were used (Figure 5B). The same results were obtained when the cells initially were stimulated with hlL24 (Figure 5C).\n\n\nAccordingly, 15D2 inhibited cynomolgus IL20-induced as well as mouse IL20- induced proliferation of the BaF-3(hlL20R) cells, while hlL19 or hlL24-induced proliferation of BaF-3(hlL20R) was not inhibited by 15D2.\n\n\nExample 3: Solubility\n\n\nSeven different human lgG4 antibodies against IL20, produced in HEK293 cells and purified by the same process, were compared for their ability to reach high concentration in solution, by using centrifuge filters of the type Amicon Ultra (Millipore Corp, MA) with a cut-off weight of 50 kD. All samples were centrifuged according to manufacturer instructions for 1 \n\n hour. The initial concentration of the antibodies ranged from 0.5 to 1.8 mg/ml, and all antibodies were formulated in 20 mM Na-Phosphate, 150 mM NaCI at pH 7.4. The VH and VL sequences of the tested antibodies are shown in Figure 4A and 4B, respectively.\n\n\nTable 2 shows the concentrations and recoveries obtained after concentrating human anti-IL20 lgG4 antibodies using Amicon Ultra 50 kD centrifuge filters. The highest concentration (above 100 mg/ml) was reached for 15D2, followed by 5B7 at above 80 mg/ml, both of which also had a high recovery. All antibodies retained its monomeric structure at the higher concentration as seen with dynamic light scattering analysis, except 2F6, which showed signs of increased dimerization.\n\n\nTable 2 - Solubility and recovery of human anti-hlL20 antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of the variable region amino acid and/or nucleic acid sequences of the antibody heavy and light chain variable regions revealed the germline sequences shown in Table 3. An additional antibody, C11 (see Example 1 ) was also sequenced, revealing a HC having the sequence of SEQ ID NO:25 and the same VL as F56Type1.\n\n\nTable 3 - VL, VH, and germline sequences of human anti-IL20 antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4: Binding of antibodies to hlL20\n\n\nA Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) experiment was performed on a BiacoreTI OO, in order to determine whether individual human anti-hlL20 antibodies were able to bind simultaneously to recombinant hlL20. For comparison, three IL20R1/IL20R2- neutralizing rat anti-hlL20 mAbs, designated 262.4.1.2.2.1 , 262.5.1.6.4.4 and 262.7.1.3.2.4 and described in WO2005/052000, were included. An inability to bind simultaneously indicates common or overlapping epitopes, though factors such as steric hindrance and conformational changes may contribute. Materials & Methods\n\n\nThe experiment was performed on a CM5 chip with immobilized anti-hlL20 antibodies . Each antibody was immobilized on separate chips to a level of -1000 RU by standard amine coupling. All samples were diluted in running-buffer, HBS-EP pH 7.4 (1OmM HEPES, 15OmM NaCI, 3mM EDTA and 0,005% Polysorbat P20). Recombinant hlL20 (10 μg/ml) was injected for 180 s, followed by injection of 15D2 (10 μg/ml) for 180 s. Results\n\n\nThe human antibodies 15D2 and 5B7 were not able to bind simultaneously to recombinant hlL20, indicating a common or overlapping epitope. In contrast, 15D2 was able to bind simultaneously with each of 262.4.1.2.2.1 , 262.5.1.6.4.4 or 262.7.1.3.2.4 mAbs, indicat- ing that the epitope of 15D2 was different from that of 262.4.1.2.2.1 , 262.5.1.6.4.4 and 262.7.1.3.2.4.\n\n\nExample 5: Binding of antibodies to denatured hll_20\n\n\nThis experiment was conducted to determine whether the human anti-IL20 antibodies also bound fully denatured antigen. If no binding activity could be detected, then peptide arrays would not be appropriate for epitope mapping (see below). In order to test for binding \n\n to the denatured antigen, native and denatured hlL20 preparations were subjected to SDS- PAGE, followed by Western-blot using 15D2 and 5B7 for detection. Materials & Methods\n\n\nRecombinant hlL20 was denatured by boiling for 10 min. in sample buffer (NuPage, Invitrogen) containing 5OmM DTT. The samples were run in SDS-PAGE (20 ul/well including sample-buffer) and blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with the primary mAb (10 μg/ml in blotting buffer (Novex, Invitrogen)), followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated Rabbit anti-human IgG polyclonal Ab (DAKO). Bands were visualized using TMB-substrate (Kem-En-Tech). Results\n\n\nBoth 15D2 and 5B7 recognized the native- and denatured form of the antigen, indicating that the epitope is continuous (linear).\n\n\nExample 6: Surface Plasmon Resonance analysis of peptide binding\n\n\nAn SPR experiment was performed in order to determine whether the anti-hlL20 an- tibodies 15D2, 262.4.1.2.2.1 , 262.5.1.6.4.4 or 262.7.1.3.2.4 bound to the region corresponding to residues 42-102 of the unprocessed precursor of hlL20 (SEQ ID NO:2), corresponding to residues 18-78 of mature hlL20 (SEQ ID NO:1). The antibodies were shown to recognize both the native and denatured form of hlL20 (for 15D2, see above).\n\n\nMaterials & Methods Five 20mer peptides with a frame shift of 10 residues were synthesized:\n\n\n1 ) IRNGFSEIRGSVQAKDGNID (residues 18-37 of SEQ ID NO:1 )\n\n\n2) SVQAKDGNIDIRILRRTESL (residues 28-47 of SEQ ID NO:1 )\n\n\n3) IRILRRTESLQDTKPANRSS (residues 38-57 of SEQ ID NO.1 )\n\n\n4) QDTKPANRSSLLRHLLRLYL (residues 48-67 of SEQ ID NO.1 ) 5) LLRHLLRLYLDRVFKNYQTPD (residues 58-78 of SEQ ID NO:1 )\n\n\nThe peptides, containing N-terminal biotin, were immobilized (500 RU) in individual flow cells on streptavidin coated (SA) chips. The individual antibodies (5 μg/ml) were injected across all flow cells for 120 s, followed by a 180 s dissociation phase. Experiments were performed on Biacore3000 and BiacoreTIOO instruments. The results were evaluated using Scrubbed software (BioLogic Software Pty Ltd).\n\n\nResults\n\n\nNo 15D2, 262.5.1.6.4.4 or 262.7.1.3.2.4 binding to the peptides was detected. The rat anti-hlL20 mAb 262.4.1.2.2.1 demonstrated binding to peptide 4 and 5, indicating binding \n\n to their shared sequence LLRHLLRLY. All mAbs demonstrated binding to immobilized intact biotinylated IL20.\n\n\nExample 7: Primary peptide array (\"peptide walk\")\n\n\nA peptide array consisting of 18mer hlL20 peptides with a frame shift of 4 residues was made and screened against fluorescence-labelled anti-hlL20 antibodies 15D2 or 5B7. Materials and Methods\n\n\nSynthesis of epitope arrays. The epitope mapping arrays were synthesized on cellulose sheets (Aims-Scientific, Germany) on an array synthesizer (Multipep Spot, Intavis, Germany) essentially using the protocols provided from the manufacturer. Fmoc-amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem (Germany) and dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) containing 0.3 M Hydrobenzotriazole (HOBt) to a final concentration of 0,3M. Coupling was done by activating with diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), and deprotection of the Fmoc group was done by 20% piperidine in NMP. The individual sequences were designed by the software accompanying the array synthesiser. After synthesis the protecting groups were removed by treating the sheets with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) 95% containing triisopro- pylsilane (TIPS) for 60 min. Then washed with dichloromethane (DCM) and N- methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) and finally with water.\n\n\nLabelling of antibodies. The screenings were done using fluorescence labelled antibodies. The labelling was done by gel-filtering the antibody stock against 1% NaHCO3, using NAP5 column (GE Healthcare according the manual from manufacturer. This was followed by adding 25 mole equivalents of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma, C1609) dissolved in DMSO. The coupling was allowed to continue for 2 hours followed by a gelfiltration against TRIS washing buffer (5OmM TRIS, pH = 7,4, 0,15M NaCI, 0,1 M ArgHCI, 0,05% Tween 20) in order to removed uncoupled fluorescein. Screening and analyzing arrays. Screening of arrays were done by adding 10 μl of antibody to 30 ml incubation buffer (0,5% BSA, 5OmM TRIS, pH = 7,4, 0.15M NaCI, 0,1 M ArgHCI, 0,05% Tween 20). The sheets were incubated for 1-2 hours, followed by washing five times with washing buffer. Then the sheets were scanned using a laser scanner (Typhoon 9410, GE Healthcare) and the image file (.gel format) was analysed using dedicated array software ArrayPro Analyzer (Media Cypernetics, USA). The fluorescence intensity were measured and transformed into digits that were exported to Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, USA) for further analysis. \n\n Results\n\n\nThe results from the primary peptide array analysis, shown in Figure 6, clearly identified that 15D2 and 5B7 both bind a linear epitope located in the region corresponding to residues 73-96 in mature hlL20 (SEQ ID NO:1 ), corresponding to residues 97-120 of the precursor (SEQ ID NO:2).\n\n\nExample 8: Secondary peptide array analysis - terminal deletions\n\n\nIn order to narrow down the length of the epitope and to evaluate which residues were important for the binding of anti-IL20 antibodies 15D2 and 5B7, an array of various truncations was made. An ala-scan was also included (section 5). For Materials and Methods, see Example 7.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe truncations from the hlL20 C-terminal revealed a gradual reduction in 15D2 binding from peptides 4 to 7 (Figure 7A). A more sudden decline in binding activity was seen for the N-terminal truncations, where removal of D (Asp) and H (His) dramatically reduced the affinity. Overall, the results showed that the minimum epitope had the sequence DHYTLRKISSLANSFL, corresponding to residues 78 to 93 of SEQ ID NO:1.\n\n\nFor 5B7, the truncations revealed a sudden reduction in binding when deleting from the N-terminal (Figure 7B). A decline of about 50% in binding activity was seen for the N- terminal truncations when removing D (Asp), and removing H (His) dramatically reduced the affinity to no detectable binding. Removing from the C-terminal resulted in a less sudden decline in affinity until removing N (Asn). Overall, the results indicate that the minimum 5B7 epitope had the sequence DHYTLRKISSLAN (residues 78-90 of SEQ ID NO:1 ), although a longer epitope, DHYTLRKISSLANSFLTIK (residues 78-96 of SEQ ID NO:1 ), did present a higher affinity. This indicated the presence of some structural requirements, e.g., α-helix de- pendence.\n\n\nThe result of the Ala scan clearly indicated that, for 15D2, three residues, H79 (His- 79), R83 (Arg-83) and N90 (Asn-90) of SEQ ID NO:1 were most critical for binding (Figure 8A). Also sensitive, but to a lesser extent, were residues D78 (Asp-78), S86 (Ser-86), F92 (Phe-92) and L93 (Leu-93). The residues H79 and N90 were most critical also for 5B7 bind- ing, while R83 (Arg) appeared fairly critical (Figure 8B).\n\n\nIn conclusion, the human anti-hlL20 antibodies 15D2 and 5B7 both bind a linear epitope (functional) of similar length and specificity, shown in Figure 1. Residues H79, R83 and N90 (bold and single-underlined) of mature hlL20 (SEQ ID NO:1 ); corresponding to H103, R107, and N114 in hlL20 precursor (SEQ ID NO:2), were found the most critical, with resi- \n\n dues D78, S86, F92 and L93 (bold and double-underlined) being moderately critical. The main difference between the two antibodies was that R83 was slightly less critical for 5B7 binding as compared to 15D2 binding.\n\n\nThe position of the 15D2/5B7 epitope and the location of the most critical residues were revealed using the crystal structure of the homologous protein IL19 (Chang et al. J Biol Chem 2003; 278: 3308). It was found that the location of the epitope corresponded to helix E in IL19, and that the most critical residues in hlL20; H79, R83, and N 90 of SEQ ID NO:1 , are exposed to the solvent. Note that the hlL20 residue H79 is a proline in hi L19.\n\n\nExample 9: Neutralization of IL20 activation of IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 re- ceptor complexes\n\n\nThis Example shows that human antibody 15D2 is capable of neutralizing murine, cynomolgous, and hlL20 activation of recombinantly expressed IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor complexes.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods Cloning of IL20 receptors. Human IL20 receptors, IL22R1 (EMBL BC029273),\n\n\nIL20R1 (EMBL AF184971 ) and IL20R2 (EMBL AY358305) were PCR-amplified from NHEK (Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocyte) cDNA and cloned into pcDNA3,1 +(zeocin) (IL22R1 and IL20R1 ) and pcDNA3,1 +(hygro)(IL20R2). Mouse IL20 receptors, mlL22R1 (EMBL AY103454), mlL20R1 (EMBL AK054215) and mlL20R2 (EMBL BC107264) were cloned by PCR using mouse liver, testis and skin cDNA, respectively, as templates. Each of these IL20R sequences is incorporated by reference, in its entirety. The mlL22R1 and mlL20R1 PCR-product were cloned into pcDNA3,1 +(zeo) and mlL20R2 into pcDNA3,1 +(hygro). Cy- nomolgus IL20 receptors, cynolL22R1 (SEQ ID NO:28), cynolL20R1 (SEQ ID NO:26) and cynolL20R2 (SEQ ID NO:27) were cloned by PCR using cynomolgus skin cDNA. The cy- nolL20R1 and cynolL22R1 receptors were inserted into pcDNA3,1 +(zeocin) and cynolL20R2 was inserted into pcDNA3,1 +(neomycin).\n\n\nThe following 5' and 3' primers were used for PCR-amplification of coding cDNA.

J Biol Chem 1998; 273:6228-6232). Luciferase assay in transient transfection. Day 0: BHK cells were seeded in T80 flask to a confluency of 40 %. Day 1 : 7.5 micrograms DNA was transfected using 36 microliters FuGene (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturers manual, 2.5 micrograms of receptor chain 1 (IL20R1 or IL22R1 ) and 2.5 micrograms of chain 2 (IL20R2) and 2.5 micrograms of luciferase reporter (KZ136). Day 2: The cells were detached using Versene and 20,000 cells per well were seeded in a black view plate. After the cells have reattached the well surface the media was exchanged with serum-free media. Day 3: either 20 microliter of 10 mM IL20 or 20 microliter of serum-free medium was added to the wells. Four hours later the luciferase activity was determined; media was removed and 100 microliter IxPBS was added to each well followed by the addition of 100 microliter Luclite substrate (PerkinElmer). The plate was incubated for 30 minutes. The luminescence was detected by a Topcount NXT (PerkinElmer). IL20 used here are either recombinantly produced hlL20 produced in E. coli, murine IL20 purchased from Biosource, #PMC0201 , or cynomolgus IL20 produced by transient expression in HEK293 6E cells and purified.\n\n\nResults Neutralization of murine IL20. The murine IL20 receptors were cloned and a transient luciferase reporter assay was set up in BHK cells. Both the two human receptor complexes and the two murine receptor complexes were stimulated with 1 nM murine IL20. Murine IL20 could activate both human and murine IL20R1/IL20R2 and IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor complexes. Neutralization by 15D2 was tested on one of the receptor complexes. The mur- ine IL20R2/IL22R1 complex was transfected into BHK cells together with the STAT3 reporter \n\n construct. The receptor complex was stimulated with 1 nM murine IL20 and exposed to 15D2 antibody in 1 , 10 and 50 microgram/ml doses (Figure 9). The lowest dose, 1 microgram/ml, neutralized the effect almost totally.\n\n\nNeutralization of cynomolgus IL20. Cynomolgus IL20 receptor sequences IL20R1 , IL20R2 and IL22R1 were cloned from cynomolgus skin tissue cDNA, using oligonucleotide primers based on human sequence. The respective sequence identities between cynomolgus and human receptor sequences were 96.8% for IL20R1 , 98.9% for IL20R2, and 95.5% for IL22R1. BHK cells were transfected with the two receptor complexes, IL20R1/IL20R2 or IL22R1/IL20R2 together with the KZ136 (the STAT3 luciferase reporter) plasmid. The cyno- molgus IL20R2/IL22R1 complex was induced 3-4 fold using 1 nM cynolL20. The\n\n\nIL20R1/IL20R2 complex from cynomolgus was stimulated about 2-fold. Increasing the amount of 15D2 decreased the IL20 activity, showing that 15D2 could neutralize cynomol- gous IL20 (Figure 10).\n\n\nNeutralization of hlL20. Human IL20 receptors IL20R1 , IL20R2 and IL22R1 , were cloned from NHEK (Normal Human Epidermal Keratinocyte) cDNA. Expression plasmids encoding the IL20 receptors were transiently transfected into BHK cells together with the luciferase reporter vector, KZ136. The stimulation was done using 1 nM hlL20 and an induction of about 3 fold was seen. Increasing the amount of 15D2 antibody decreased the IL20 activity (Figure 11 ).\n\n\nExample 10: Inhibition of hlL20-induced proliferation\n\n\nThis Example evaluates the inhibitory effects of 15D2 and rat anti-hlL20 mAbs on IL20-induced proliferation of BaF-3 cells expressing IL20R1 and IL20R2 (herein \"hlL20R\"), and the form of IL20 bound by 15D2.\n\n\nMaterials & Methods Three independent experiments (\"148\", \"149\" and \"150\") compared EC50 values of the four tested abs. First, antibodies were added in a 3-fold serial dilution with 50ul/well in media. At the same time 10μl hlL20 was added to every well and at last 40μl of cell- suspension. Antibodies were diluted to a 3-fold serial dilution (100+200), with the first dilution in the assay at 20μg/ml. hlL20 preparation was diluted to 10\n\"7\nM, with dilution in assay to 10\n\"\n \n8\nM. As a control, the following stimulation curve was made: hlL20 was diluted to 10\n\"6\nM and from this a 10-fold dilution row. First dilution in the assay was 10-7M.\n\n\nBaF-3 cells recombinantly expressing human IL20R1/IL20R2 were centrifuged, re- suspended in media without IL3, and counted. They were then washed twice in media without IL3, and added into 96-wells flat-bottomed view plates at a concentration of 10\n4\nc/well and \n\n 40μl. Dilution of cells: 10\n4\nc/40μl, 2,5x10\n6\nc/1 OmI (enough for 2 plates). Incubation of plates for 3 days in a CO\n2\n incubator (5%CO\n2\n, 37\n0\nC). AlamarBlue 10μl/w was added, and after 6 hours incubation plates were measured on a Polarstar fluorometer, exitation 550-12nm and emission 590nm.\n\n\nIn order to investigate whether 15D2 bound the soluble form of IL20 or the receptor- bound form of IL20, an experimental setup was designed where 15D2 was added in a 3-fold serial dilution. At the same time, 10μl hlL20 was added to the wells and subsequently 40μl of BaF3(hlL20R = hlL20R1 and hlL20R2) cell-suspension. Finally, hlL19 was added simultaneously (t=0) or after 1 minute (t=1 ).\n\n\nResults\n\n\nFrom the initial experiment testing proliferation as a function of concentration of hlL20 shown, it was chosen to measure the EC50 values of antibodies at 10\n\"8\n M hlL20.\n\n\nThree independent experiments tested the inhibitory effects of antibodies on IL20 induced proliferation. EC50 values were calculated both with and without defined top and bottom. The latter gave the best correlation between the three independent experiments and was used for comparison of inhibitory effects (curves were fitted by \"sigmoidal dose- response with variable slope\" in Prism). Table 4 below shows the EC50 values of the three experiments, comparing EC50 values for inhibition of IL20-induced proliferation of BaF-3 cells expressing IL20R1 and IL20R2.\n\n\nTable 4 - Inhibition of hlL20-induced proliferation of BaF-3 (hlL20R1/hlL20R2) cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncluded on three plates\n\n\nThe EC50 values were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey post test. All of 15D2, 262.4.1.2.2.1 and 262.7.1.3.2.4 inhibited IL20 induced proliferation in IL20R trans- fected BaF-3 cells significantly better than 262.5.1.6.4.4. While the average EC50 values for 262.4.1.2.2.1 and 262.7.1.3.2.4 were lower than those of 15D2, the differences were not statistically significant (P < 0.05).With respect to the assay investigating whether 15D2 bound the soluble or receptor-bound form of IL20, the results showed that addition of I L 19 reverted the 15D2 blocking of IL20-induced proliferation (Figure 12). This meant that 15D2 prevented \n\n binding of IL20 to the hlL20R, but that 15D2 did not prevent binding of IL19 to the receptor. Thus, 15D2 bound the soluble form of IL20 and not the receptor-bound form, which would otherwise block access of IL19 to the receptor.\n\n\nExample 11 : Neutralization of IL20 activation of IL22R1/IL20R2 This example shows the inhibitory effect of human antibody 15D2 and rat anti-hlL20 mAbs on IL20-induced signalling via human IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor complex in a Luciferase reporter assay.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nGeneration a human IL20 reporter cell line. The human IL20R2 in pcDNA3,1 +(hygro) plasmid, IL22R1 in pcDNA3,1 +(zeocin)plasmid and the STAT3 reporter plasmid KZ136 (neomycin) were transfected into BHK cells and selected by 200 ug/ml hy- gromycin, 400 ug/ml zeocin and 600 ug/ml geneticin. Clones were picked and the most IL20 responsive clone was selected, \"BHK 1-B4\". The BHK 1-B4 cell line responds approximately 10-fold in luciferase read-out to 10 nM IL20 compared to basal level (no stimulation). Luciferase assay in stable BHK 1-B4 cells. The BHK 1-B4 were seeded in 96 well plates, 20,000 cells / well. Sixteen hours after seeding the cells were stimulated with 10 nM IL20 or mixtures with 10 nM IL20 and antibodies or plain media. The cells were stimulated for 4 hours, media was removed, 100 ul PBS (including Ca++ and Mg++) and 100 ul luciferase substrate (Steady-GLO) was added to the wells. The plate was incubated for 30 minutes. The luminescence was detected by a Topcount NXT (PerkinElmer). Results\n\n\nNeutralization of hlL20 by anti-IL20 antibodies. The stable cell line BHK 1-B4 was generated by stably transfection of plasmids expressing IL20R2 and IL22R and the STAT3 Luciferase reporter plasmid, KZ136. Antibodies were mixed with IL20 prior to addition to the cells. The IL20 concentration was kept at 10 nM whereas the antibodies were added in range from 133 nM to 0,19 nM in 3-fold dilutions. Dose-response curves were obtained for the four antibodies, and EC50 values were calculated based on the curves fitted by \"sigmoidal dose- response with variable slope\" in GraphPad Prism (Table 4). 15D2 neutralized signalling via hlL22R1/hlL20R2 as efficiently as 262.4.1.2.2.1 and better than 262.5.1.6.4.4 and 262.7.1.3.2.4.\n\n\nTable 5 - Neutralization of IL20 activation of IL22R1/IL20R2 receptor complex\n\n\nAnti-IL20 antibody EC50 (nM)\n\n\n15D2 (NN) 4.98 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12: Determination of kinetic parameters\n\n\nProtein interactions can be monitored in real time using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses. This Example describes SRP analysis on Biacore 3000 and Biacore T100 instruments, in order to characterize hybidoma-produced and/or recombinantly expressed human anti-IL20 antibodies 15D2 and 5B7 with respect to affinity towards recombinant hlL20.\n\n\nAffinity studies were performed using a direct binding procedure, with the monoclonal antibody covalently coupled via free amine groups to the carboxymethylated dextrane membrane (CM5) on the sensor chip surface. Recombinant hlL20 was injected in various concentrations, followed by a dissociation period with constant buffer flow over the sensor chip surface. Using this experimental design, the binding of hlL20 to the immobilized monoclonal antibody could be regarded as a 1 :1 binding, with one hlL20 molecule binding to one antibody binding site. The kinetic parameters for the interaction could be calculated using a 1 :1 interaction Langmuir fitting model. Materials & Methods\n\n\n15D2 wild-type (wt) expressed by hybridoma cells, 15D2-wt expressed in HEK293 cells, 15D2 with an S241 P mutation expressed in HEK293 cells,15D2-S241 P expressed in CHO cells, and 5B7-wt expressed by hybridoma cells, were analyzed. The purified monoclonal antibodies were immobilized in individual flow cells on a CM5 type sensor chip. Immo- bilizations were performed using a standard amine coupling procedure, aiming for an immobilization level of 1000 Resonance Units (RU). The antibodies were diluted to 5 μg/ml in 10 mM NaAc pH 5.0. HPS-EP pH 7.4 (1OmM HEPES, 15OmM NaCI, 3mM EDTA and 0,005% Polysorbate P20) was used as running buffer, and diluent for the recombinant hlL20. Recombinant purified hlL20 was diluted to 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 and 3.125 nM. Association (injection) was 3 min., followed by a 30 min. dissociation (wash) period. Flow rate was 30 μl/min. Experiments were performed at 25\n0\nC. Regeneration of the surface following each cycle, was accomplished by injection of 30 sec. pulse of 10 mM Glycin-HCI pH 1.8, at a 30 ul/min flow rate. Detection in all flow cells simultaneously. Flow cell No. 1 contained no immobilized antibody, and was used for subtraction of background and bulk. The kinetic pa- rameters were calculated by local fitting of the data for a given antibody- antigen combination using a 1 :1 Langmuir binding model. Data was inspected for mass-transport limitations prior \n\n to calculation of the kinetic parameters. Experiments were performed on Biacore 3000 and T100 instruments. Data was evaluated using Biaeval 4.1 and Biacore T100 evaluation software.\n\n\nResults.\n\n\nThe calculated affinities for the binding of recombinant hlL20 to the individual antibodies are listed in Table 6 below, showing rate constants and affinities of the individual anti- IL20 monoclonal antibodies. The affinities are listed in molar units (M), the on-rates in (1/Ms) and the off-rates in (1/s). The rate constants are listed in brackets below the affinity, as (on- rate / off-rate).\n\n\nThe affinity determination, valid for the buffer used and with the recombinant form of the antigen, demonstrated KD values of both 15D2-wt HEK293 and 15D2-S241 P CHO in the lower pM range. Furthermore, the affinities of the hybridoma expressed antibodies demonstrated affinities of about 0.5 nM KD of the 15D2-wt and 5B7-wt.\n\n\nTable 6 - kinetic parameters for 15D2 and 5B7 interactions with recombinant hlL20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 13: 15D2 Binding interface on IL20\n\n\nThis Example identifies the 15D2 binding interface on hlL20 using HX-MS technology. Unless otherwise indicated, the numbering of hlL20 amino acid residues in this Example refers to SEQ ID NO:1 with an N-terminal Met (M) residue (i.e., residue Y67 in this Example corresponds to residue Y66 in SEQ ID NO:1 ).\n\n\nHXMS provides the possibility for mimicking in vivo conditions (see, e.g., Wales and Engen, Mass Spectrom. Rev. 25, 158 (2006), and Coales et al, Rapid Commun. Mass Spec- trom. 23, 639 (2009)). The HX-MS technology used here provided information on which sur- face exposed amide hydrogens in IL20 became shielded from exchange with solvent upon \n\n 15D2 antibody binding, thereby facilitating a mapping of the binding interface. Furthermore, the methodology can also reveal more indirect structural effects in IL20. Here observed as a slight stabilization of the structure upon 15D2 binding as seen in some regions.\n\n\nAmide hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HX) was initiated by a 23-fold dilution of IL20 in the presence or absence of 15D2 (Fab fragment) into the corresponding deuterated buffer (Ae. 25 mM MES, 80 mM NaCI, 96% D\n2\nO, pH 6.4 (uncorrected value)). Non-deuterated controls were prepared by dilution into an identical protiated buffer. All HX reactions were carried out at 20\n°\nC and contained 4 μM IL20 in the absence or presence of 5 μM 15D2. Preliminary data had demonstrated full saturation of IL20 binding at these protein concentrations. At appropriate time intervals, aliquots of the HX reaction were quenched by an equal volume of ice-cold quenching buffer (1.35M Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, adjusted to pH 2.5 using NaOH) resulting in a final pH of 2.6 (uncorrected value). Quenched samples were immediately injected onto a cooled ultra high pressure liquid chromatography (UPLC)-mass spectrometry system (described in detail below) for pepsin digestion, rapid de- salting and mass analysis.\n\n\nAll sample preparation, handling and injections were performed by a HD-x PAL auto-sampler (LEAP Technologies Inc.). The protein and quench solutions were held at 2\n0\nC and deuterated buffer and labelling reactions were held at 2O\n0\nC. A cooling box, temperature controlled at 1.5\n0\nC, contained the injection and switching valves, tubing, plumbing and col- umns. Pepsin column (Applied Biosystems), VanGuard C18 trapping column (Waters) and Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 urn, 2.1x100 mm analytical column (Waters Inc) were used. The LC flow was delivered from an Acquity UPLC pump using 0.1% Formic acid in H2O and 0.1 %Formic acid in acetonitrile. A Q-ToF premier was used for mass analysis (Waters Inc). Peptic peptides were identified in separate experiments using standard MS/MS methods. Average masses of peptide isotopic envelopes were determined from lockmass- corrected centroided data (processed using MassLynx software, Waters Inc.) using the software HXExpress (Weis et al., J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 17, 1700 (2006)).\n\n\nThe HX time-course of 22 peptides, covering 93% of the primary sequence of IL20, were monitored in the presence and absence 15D2 (Figure 13). The IL20 exchange pattern observed could be divided into two different groups. One group of peptides displayed an exchange pattern that was largely unaffected by the binding of 15D2. For example, Peptide 127-145 represented a region of IL20 that was unaffected by 15D2 binding. Some, however, showed a slight decrease in exchange at 30 sec due to slight stabilization of the protein structure upon 15D2 binding. For example, Peptides 17-38, 60-66 and 146-153 represented regions of IL20 that were outside the binding epitope but might show a slight structural stabi- \n\n lization upon 15D2 binding. In contrast, another group of peptides IL20 show strong protection, here more than 3 deuterons, from exchange upon 15D2 binding. Peptides 67-83, 67-93, 69-89, 69-93 and 84-93 represented peptides that were part of the binding epitope of 15D2.Thus, the region displaying protection upon 15D2 binding encompassed peptides from residues 67-93. For example at 30 sec exchange with D\n2\nO, approximately 10 amides were protected from exchange in the region 69-93 upon 15D2 binding. The specific peptides and number of deuterons shielded from exchange upon 15D2 binding are depicted in Figure 14 where the information gained after 30 sec exchange in D\n2\nO was sub-localized to few residues. The 15D2 binding interface could thus be localized to residues 71-93, containing the sequence VFKNYQTPDHYTLRKISSLANSF and corresponding to residues 70-92 of SEQ ID NO:1. The region containing residues 71-83, however, was protected to a lesser extent from deuterium exchange upon 15D2 binding. This indicates that the overall 15D2 binding in this region was less tight and, most likely, that only a fraction of these residues were involved in 15D2 binding. The residues 84-85 showed complete protection from exchange upon 15D2 binding and the region 86-93 was also highly affected by 15D2 binding, together correspond- ding to residues 83-92 of SEQ ID NO:1.\n\n\nAll references, including publications, patent applications and patents, cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each reference was individu- ally and specifically indicated to be incorporated by reference and was set forth in its entirety herein.\n\n\nAll headings and sub-headings are used herein for convenience only and should not be construed as limiting the invention in any way,\n\n\nAny combination of the above-described elements in all possible variations thereof is encompassed by the invention unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context.\n\n\nThe terms \"a\" and \"an\" and \"the\" and similar referents as used in the context of describing the invention are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context.
