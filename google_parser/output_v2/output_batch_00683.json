The GABA A receptor complex which is a membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer is composed principally of α,β and γ subunits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPresently a total number of 21 subunits of the GABA A receptor have been cloned and sequenced. Three types of subunits (α, β and γ) are required for the construction of recombinant GABA A receptors which most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological functions of native GABA A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepine binding site lies between the α and γ subunits. Among the recombinant GABA A receptors, α1β2γ2 mimics many effects of the classical type-I BzR subtypes, whereas α2β2γ2, α32γ2 and α5β2γ2 ion channels are termed type-II BzR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been shown by \nMcNamara and Skelton in Psychobiology, 21:101-108\n that the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist β-CCM enhance spatial learning in the Morris watermaze. However, β-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists are proconvulsant or convulsant which prevents their use as cognition enhancing agents in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective within the GABA A receptor subunits, whereas a GABA A α5 receptor partial or full inverse agonists which is relatively free of activity at GABA A α1 and/or α2 and/or α3 receptor binding sites can be used to provide a medicament which is useful for enhancing cognition with reduced or without proconvulsant activity. It is also possible to use GABA A α5 inverse agonists which are not free of activity at GABA A α1 and/or α2 and/or α3 receptor binding sites but which are functionally selective for α5 containing subunits. However, inverse agonists\n\nwhich are selective for GABA A α5 subunits and are relatively free of activity at GABA A α1, α2 and α3 receptor binding sites are preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO 2007/071598\n \n, \n \nWO 2007/074089\n \n, \n \nWO 2004/022555\n \n and \n \nUS 2004/006226\n \n disclose some isoxazole derivatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObjects of the present invention are compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, the preparation of the above mentioned compounds, medicaments containing them and their manufacture as well as the use of the above mentioned compounds in the control or prevention of illnesses, especially of illnesses and disorders of the kind referred to earlier or in the manufacture of corresponding medicaments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most preferred indication in accordance with the present invention is Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following definitions of the general terms used in the present description apply irrespective of whether the terms in question appear alone or in combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"lower alkyl\" denotes a straight- or branched-chain alkyl group containing from 1-7, preferably from 1 - 4 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, t-butyl and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"lower alkyl substituted by halogen\" denotes a lower alkyl chain as defined hereinabove which is substituted by one or more, preferably one, two of three halogen(s), i.e. chlorine, iodine, fluorine or bromine.

The cell pellets were resuspended in Krebs-tris buffer and homogenized by polytron for ca. 15 sec on ice. Protein was measured (Bradford method, Bio-Rad) and aliquots of 1 mL were prepared and stored at -80 °C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadioligand binding assays were carried out in a volume of 200 mL (96-well plates) which contained 100 mL of cell memebranes, [3H]flumazenil at a concentration of 1 nM for α1, α2, α3 subunits and 0.5 nM for α5 subunits and the test compound in the range of 10-10\n-3\n x 10\n-6\n M. Nonspecific binding was defined by 10\n-5\n M diazepam and typically represented less than 5% of the total binding. Assays were incubated to equilibrium for 1 hour at 4 °C and harvested onto GF/C uni-filters (Packard) by filtration using a Packard harvester and washing with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris; pH 7.5). After drying, filter-retained radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting. Ki values were calculated using Excel-Fit (Microsoft) and are the means of two determinations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the accompanying examples were tested in the above described assay, and the preferred compounds were found to possess a Ki value for displacement of [3H]flumazenil from α5 subunits of the rat GABA A receptor of 100 nM or less. Most preferred are compounds with a Ki (nM) < 35.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compounds that inhibit serine protease activity, particularly the activity of hepatitis C virus NS3-NS4A protease. As such, they act by interfering with the life cycle of the hepatitis C virus and are also useful as antiviral agents. The invention further relates to compositions for either ex vivo use or for administration to a patient suffering from HCV infection. The invention also relates to methods of treating an HCV infection in a patient by administering a composition of this invention.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nInfection by hepatitis C virus (\"HCV\") is a compelling human medical problem. HCV is recognized as the causative agent for most cases of non-A, non-B hepatitis, with an estimated human sero-prevalence of 3% globally [\nA. Alberti et al., \"\nNatural History of Hepatitis C,\n\" J. Hepatology, 31., (Suppl. 1), pp. 17-24 (1999\n)]. Nearly four million individuals may be infected in the United States alone [\nM.J. Alter et al., \"The Epidemiology of Viral Hepatitis in the United States, Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am., 23, pp. 437-455 (1994\n); \nM. J. Alter \"\nHepatitis C Virus Infection in the United States,\n\" J. Hepatology, 31., (Suppl. 1), pp. 88-91 (1999\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon first exposure to HCV only about 20% of infected individuals develop acute clinical hepatitis while others appear to resolve the infection spontaneously. In almost 70% of instances, however, the virus establishes a chronic infection that persists for decades [\nS. Iwarson, \"\nThe Natural Course of Chronic Hepatitis,\n\" FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 14, pp. 201-204 (1994\n); \nD. Lavanchy, \"\nGlobal Surveillance and Control of Hepatitis C,\n\" J. Viral Hepatitis, 6, pp. 35-47 (1999\n)]. This usually results in recurrent and progressively worsening liver inflammation, which often leads to more severe disease states such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [\nM.C. Kew, \"\nHepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma\n\", FEMS Microbiology Reviews, 14, pp. 211-220 (1994\n); \nI. Saito et al., \"\nHepatitis C Virus Infection is Associated with the Development of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,\n\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87, pp. 6547-6549 (1990\n)]. Unfortunately, there are no broadly effective treatments for the debilitating progression of chronic HCV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HCV genome encodes a polyprotein of 3010-3033 amino acids [\nQ.L. Choo, et al., \"\nGenetic Organization and Diversity of the Hepatitis C Virus.\n\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 88, pp. 2451-2455 (1991\n); \nN. Kato et al., \"\nMolecular Cloning of the Human Hepatitis C Virus Genome From Japanese Patients with Non-A, Non-B Hepatitis,\n\" Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87, pp. 9524-9528 (1990\n); A. \nTakamizawa et al., \"\nStructure and Organization of the Hepatitis C Virus Genome Isolated From Human Carriers,\n\" J. Virol., 65, pp. 1105-1113 (1991\n)]. The HCV nonstructural (NS) proteins are presumed to provide the essential catalytic machinery for viral replication. The NS proteins are derived by proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein [\nR. Bartenschlager et al., \"\n); \nA. Grakoui et al., \"\nCharacterization of the Hepatitis C Virus-Encoded Serine Proteinase: Determination of Proteinase-Dependent Polyprotein Cleavage Sites,\n\" J. Virol., 67, pp. 2832-2843 (1993\n); \nA. Grakoui et al., \"\nExpression and Identification of Hepatitis C Virus Polyprotein Cleavage Products,\n\" J. Virol., 67, pp. 1385-1395 (1993\n); \nL. Tomei et al., \"\nNS3 is a serine protease required for processing of hepatitis C virus polyprotein\n\", J. Virol., 67, pp. 4017-4026 (1993\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HCV NS protein 3 (NS3) contains a serine protease activity that helps process the majority of the viral enzymes, and is thus considered essential for viral replication and infectivity. The HCV NS3 serine protease is essential for viral replication since the substitutions of the catalytic triad resulted in loss of infectivity in chimpanzees [\nA.A. Kolykhalov et al., \"\nHepatitis C virus-encoded enzymatic activities and conserved RNA elements in the 3' nontranslated region are essential for virus replication in vivo\n\", J. Virol., 74: 2046-2051\n]. The first 181 amino acids of NS3 (residues 1027-1207 of the viral polyprotein) have been shown to contain the serine protease domain of NS3 that processes all four downstream sites of the HCV polyprotein [\nC. Lin et al., \"\nHepatitis C Virus NS3 Serine Proteinase: Trans-Cleavage Requirements and Processing Kinetics\n\", J. Virol., 68, pp. 8147-8157 (1994\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HCV NS3 serine protease and its associated cofactor, NS4A, helps process the viral non-structural protein region into individual non-structural proteins, including all of the viral enzymes. This processing appears to be analogous to that carried out by the human immunodeficiency virus aspartyl protease, which is also involved in processing of viral proteins. HIV protease inhibitors, which inhibit viral protein processing are potent antiviral agents in man, indicating that interrupting this stage of the viral life cycle results in therapeutically active agents. Consequently it is an attractive target for drug discovery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral potential HCV protease inhibitors have been described in the prior art [\n \nPCT publication Nos. WO 02/18369\n \n, \n \nWO 02/08244\n \n, \n \nWO 00/09558\n \n, \n \nWO 00/09543\n \n, \n \nWO 99/64442\n \n, \n \nWO 99/07733\n \n, \n \nWO 99/07734\n \n, \n \nWO 99/50230\n \n, \n \nWO 98/46630\n \n, \n \nWO 98/17679\n \n and \n \nWO 97/43310\n \n, United States Patent \n \n5,990,276\n \n, \nM. Llinas-Brunet et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 8, pp. 1713-18 (1998\n); \nW. Han et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 10, 711-13 (2000\n); \nR. Dunsdon et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem.

It is not known however whether these compounds would have the appropriate profiles to be acceptable drugs. Furthermore, most, if not all of these inhibitors were discovered using the genotype 1 (1a or 1b) NS3-4A serine protease as the target. However, there are a variety of genotypes of HCV, and a variety of subtypes within each genotype. For example, at present it is known that there are eleven (numbered 1 through 11) main genotypes of HCV, although others have classified the genotypes as 6 main genotypes. Each of these genotypes is further subdivided into subtypes (1a -1c; 2a-2c; 3a-3b; 4a-4e; 5a; 6a; 7a-7b; 8a-8b; 9a; 10a; and 11a).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prevalence of the subtypes varies globally as follows:\n\n \n \n \n \n1a\n \nFound mostly in North and South America; common in Australia\n \n \n \n1b\n \nFound mostly in Europe and Asia\n \n \n \n2a\n \nMost common genotype 2 in Japan and China\n \n \n \n2b\n \nMost common genotype 2 in US and Northern Europe\n \n \n \n2c\n \nMost common genotype 2 in Western and Southern Europe\n \n \n \n3a\n \nHighly prevalent in Australia and South Asia\n \n \n \n4a\n \nHighly prevalent in Egypt\n \n \n \n4c\n \nHighly prevalent in Central Africa\n \n \n \n5a\n \nHighly prevalent in South Africa\n \n \n \n6a\n \nRestricted to Hong Kong, Macau and Vietnam\n \n \n \n7a & 7b\n \nCommon in Thailand\n \n \n \n8a, 8b & 8c\n \nPrevalent in Vietnam\n \n \n \n10a and 11a\n \nFound in Indonesia\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe current scientific belief is that HCV genotype or subtype may determine the responsiveness of the patient to therapy. While it has been noted that there is a correlation between the degree of genomic complexity of the HCV and the patient's response to interferon therapy the reason for this correlation is unclear. It is generally accepted that genotype 2 HCV and \ngenotype\n 3 HCV virus-infected patients respond to conventional therapy to a different degree than those patient infected with \ngenotype\n 1 HCV. Thus, while a number of HCV protease inhibitors have been designed/discovered against \ngenotype\n 1 HCV protease, it is not clear whether these inhibitors will effectively inhibit the HCV NS3-4A serine proteases from other genotypes, such as for example genotype 2 HCV and \ngenotype\n 3 HCV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, the current understanding of HCV has not led to any satisfactory anti-HCV agents or treatments. The only established therapy for HCV disease is combination treatment of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. However, interferons have significant side effects [\nM. A. Wlaker et al., \"\nHepatitis C Virus: An Overview of Current Approaches and Progress,\n\" DDT, 4, pp. 518-29 (1999\n); \nD. Moradpour et al., \"\nCurrent and Evolving Therapies for Hepatitis C,\n\" Eur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol., 11, pp. 1199-1202 (1999\n); \nH. L. A. Janssen et al. \"\nSuicide Associated with Alfa-Interferon Therapy for Chronic Viral Hepatitis,\n\" J. Hepatol., 21, pp..241-243 (1994\n); \nP.F. Renault et al., \"\nSide Effects of Alpha Interferon,\n\" Seminars in Liver Disease, 9, pp. 273-277. (1989\n)] and induce long term remission in only a fraction (~ 25%) of cases [\nO. Weiland, \"\nInterferon Therapy in Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection\n\" , FEMS Microbiol. Rev., 14, pp. 279-288 (1994\n)]. In addition, this combination treatment has roughly 80% sustained viral response (SVR) for patients infected with \ngenotype\n 2 or 3 HCV and 40-50% SVR in \ngenotype\n 1 HCV-infected patients [\nJ.G. McHutchison, et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 339: 1485-1492 (1998\n); \nG.L. Davis et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 339: 1493-1499 (1998\n)]. Moreover, the prospects for effective anti-HCV vaccines remain uncertain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, there is a need for more effective anti-HCV therapies, particularly compounds that inhibit HCV NS3 protease. Such compounds may be useful as antiviral agents, particularly as anti-HCV agents. There is also a need for compounds that inhibit various genotypes of the HCV serine protease.\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention addresses these needs by providing a method for inhibiting genotype-2 and genotype-3 HCV with VX-950. While the present invention exemplifies that VX-950 is superior to other protease inhibitors at specifically inhibiting genotype-2 and genotype-3 HCV, it is contemplated that \nother non-genotype\n 1 HCV genotypes also may be beneficially inhibited by VX-950.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to compositions that comprise the VX-950 and the use thereof. Such compositions may be used to pre-treat invasive devices to be inserted into a patient, to treat biological samples, such as blood, prior to administration to a patient, and for direct administration to a patient. In each case the composition will be used to inhibit HCV replication and to lessen the risk of or the severity of HCV infection.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nFig. 1\n The alignment of amino acid sequence of eleven genotype 2 HCV NS3 serine protease domains\n\n\n \nFig. 2\n.

VX-950 may be prepared in general by methods known to those skilled in the art (see, e.g., \n \nWO 02/18369\n \n).\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound of this invention may contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and thus may occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. All such isomeric forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. Each stereogenic carbon may be of the R or S configuration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in certain embodiments, compounds used may be mixtures of the D- and L-isomers at the N-propyl-side chain as depicted in the following structure:\n\n \n \n\nOther agents generated through rational drug design using e.g., VX-950 or the compound of Structure A as a starting compound may be tested for their activity as protease inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the compounds of this invention have the structure and stereochemistry depicted in compounds in VX-950.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of this invention provides a composition comprising VX-950 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. According to a preferred embodiment, VX-950 is present in an amount effective to decrease the viral load in a sample or in a patient, wherein said virus encodes a serine protease necessary for the viral life cycle, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf pharmaceutically acceptable salts of a compound of this invention are utilized in these compositions, those salts are preferably derived from inorganic or organic acids and bases. Included among such acid salts are the following: acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzene sulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphor sulfonate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenyl-propionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate and undecanoate. Base salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts, such as sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases, such as dicyclohexylamine salts, N-methyl-D-glucamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and so forth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chloride, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates, such as dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates, long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides, aralkyl halides, such as benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are thereby obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds utilized in the compositions and methods of this invention may also be modified by appending appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable carriers that may be used in these compositions include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the compositions of this invention are formulated for pharmaceutical administration to a mammal, preferably a human being.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. The term \"parenteral\" as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques. Preferably, the compositions are administered orally or intravenously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable forms of the compositions of this invention may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension. These suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents which are commonly used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage levels of between about 0.01 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably between about 0.5 and about 75 mg/kg body weight per day of the protease inhibitor compounds described herein are useful in a monotherapy for the prevention and treatment of antiviral, particularly anti-HCV mediated disease. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be administered from about 1 to about 5 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. A typical preparation will contain from about 5% to about 95% active compound (w/w). Preferably, such preparations contain from about 20% to about 80% active compound. As recognized by skilled practitioners, dosages of interferon are typically measured in IU (e.g., about 4 million IU to about 12 million IU).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compositions of this invention comprise a combination of VX-950 and one or more additional therapeutic or prophylactic agents, both the compound and the additional agent should be present at dosage levels of between about 10 to 100%, and more preferably between about 10 to 80% of the dosage normally administered in a monotherapy regimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers that are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried cornstarch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents may also be added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These may be prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be administered topically, especially when the target of treatment includes areas or organs readily accessible by topical application, including diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTopical application for the lower intestinal tract may be effected in a rectal suppository formulation (see above) or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical applications, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one or more carriers. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a suitable lotion or cream containing the active components suspended or dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, \npolysorbate\n 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor ophthalmic use, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated as micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with our without a preservative such as benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic uses, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or dispersing agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost preferred are pharmaceutical compositions formulated for oral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the compositions of this invention additionally comprise another anti-viral agent, preferably an anti-HCV agent. Such anti-viral agents include, but are not limited to, immunomodulatory agents, such as α-, β-, and γ-interferons, pegylated derivatized interferon-α compounds, and thymosin; other anti-viral agents, such as ribavirin, amantadine, and telbivudine; other inhibitors of hepatitis C proteases (NS2-NS3 inhibitors and NS3-NS4A inhibitors); inhibitors of other targets in the HCV life cycle, including helicase and polymerase inhibitors; inhibitors of internal ribosome entry; broad-spectrum viral inhibitors, such as IMPDH inhibitors (e.g., compounds of United States Patent \n \n5,807,876\n \n, \n \n6,498,178\n \n, \n \n6,344,465\n \n, \n \n6,054,472\n \n, \n \nWO 97/40028\n \n, \n \nWO 98/40381\n \n, \n \nWO 00/56331\n \n, and mycophenolic acid and derivatives thereof, and including, but not limited to VX-497, VX-148, and/or VX-944); or combinations of any of the above.

The chemical reactions described in the references cited above are generally disclosed in terms of their broadest application to the preparation of the compounds of this invention. Occasionally, the reactions may not be applicable as described to each compound included within the scope of compounds disclosed herein. The compounds for which this occurs will be readily recognized by those skilled in the art. In all such cases, either the reactions can be successfully performed by conventional modifications known to those skilled in the art, e.g., by appropriate protection of interfering groups, by changing to alternative conventional reagents, by routine modification of reaction conditions, and the like, or other reactions disclosed herein or otherwise conventional will be applicable to the preparation of the corresponding compounds of this invention. In all preparative methods, all starting materials are known or readily preparable from known starting materials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile nucleoside analogs are generally employed as antiviral agents as is, nucleotides (nucleoside phosphates) sometimes have to be converted to nucleosides in order to facilitate their transport across cell membranes.

For example, interferon alpha is typically administered to humans for the treatment of HCV infections in an amount of from about 1 x 10\n6\n units/person three times per week to about 10 x 10\n6\n units/person three times per week (\nSimon et al., Hepatology 25: 445-448 (1997\n)). In the methods and compositions of the present invention, this dose can be in the range of from about 0. 1 x 10\n6\n units/person three times per week to about 7. 5 x 10\n6\n units/person three times per week; more preferably from about 0. 5 x 10\n6\n units/person three times per week to about 5 x 10\n6\n units/person three times per week; most preferably from about 1 x 10\n6\n units/person three times per week to about 3 x 10\n6\n units/person three times per week. Due to the enhanced hepatitis C virus antiviral effectiveness of immunomodulators, immunostimulants or other anti-HCV agent in the presence of the HCV serine protease inhibitors of the present invention, reduced amounts of these immunomodulators/immunostimulants can be employed in the treatment methods and compositions contemplated herein. Similarly, due to the enhanced hepatitis C virus antiviral effectiveness of the present HCV serine protease inhibitors in the presence of immunomodulators and immunostimulants, reduced amounts of these HCV serine protease inhibitors can be employed in the methods and compositions contmplated herein. Such reduced amounts can be determined by routine monitoring of hepatitis C virus titers in infected patients undergoing therapy. This can be carried out by, for example, monitoring HCV RNA in patients' serum by slot-blot, dot-blot, or RT-PCR techniques, or by measurement of HCV surface or other antigens. Patients can be similarly monitored during combination therapy employing the HCV serine protease inhibitors disclosed herein and other compounds having anti-HCV activity, for example nucleoside and/or nucleotide antiviral agents, to determine the lowest effective doses of each when used in combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the methods of combination therapy disclosed herein, nucleoside or nucleotide antiviral compounds, or mixtures thereof, can be administered to humans in an amount in the range of from about 0.1 mg/person/day to about 500 mg/person/day; preferably from about 10 mg/person/day to about 300 mg/person/day; more preferably from about 25 mg/person/day to about 200 mg/person/day; even more preferably from about 50 mg/person/day to about 150 mg/person/day; and most preferably in the range of from about 1 mg/person/day to about 50 mg/person/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDoses of compounds can be administered to a patient in a single dose or in proportionate doses. In the latter case, dosage unit compositions can contain such amounts of submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. Multiple doses per day can also increase the total daily dose should this be desired by the person prescribing the drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe regimen for treating a patient suffering from a HCV infection with the compounds and/or compositions of the present invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors, including the age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the patient, the severity of the infection, the route of administration, pharmacological considerations such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology profiles of the particular compounds employed, and whether a drug delivery system is utilized. Administration of the drug combinations disclosed herein should generally be continued over a period of several weeks to several months or years until virus titers reach acceptable levels, indicating that infection has been controlled or eradicated. Patients undergoing treatment with the drug combinations disclosed herein can be routinely monitored by measuring hepatitis viral RNA in patients' serum by slot-blot, dot-blot, or RT-PCR techniques, or by measurement of hepatitis C viral antigens, such as surface antigens, in serum to determine the effectiveness of therapy. Continuous analysis of the data obtained by these methods permits modification of the treatment regimen during therapy so that optimal amounts of each component in the combination are administered, and so that the duration of treatment can be determined as well. Thus, the treatment regimen/dosing schedule can be rationally modified over the course of therapy so that the lowest amounts of each of the antiviral compounds used in combination which together exhibit satisfactory anti-hepatitis C virus effectiveness are administered, and so that administration of such antiviral compounds in combination is continued only so long as is necessary to successfully treat the infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses the use of the HCV serine protease inhibitors disclosed herein in various combinations with the foregoing and similar types of compounds having anti-HCV activity to treat or prevent HCV infections in patients. For example, one or more HCV serine protease inhibitors can be used in combination with: one or more interferons or interferon derivatives having anti-HCV activity; one or more non-interferon compounds having anti-HCV activity; or one or more interferons or interferon derivatives having anti-HCV activity and one or more non-interferon compounds having anti-HCV activity. When used in combination to treat or prevent HCV infection in a human patient, any of the presently disclosed HCV serine protease inhibitors and foregoing compounds having anti-HCV activity can be present in a pharmaceutically or anti-HCV effective amount. By virtue of their additive or synergistic effects, when used in the combinations described above, each can also be present in a subclinical pharmaceutically effective or anti-HCV effective amount, i.e., an amount that, if used alone, provides reduced pharmaceutical effectiveness in completely inhibiting or reducing the accumulation of HCV virions and/or reducing or ameliorating conditions or symptoms associated with HCV infection or pathogenesis in patients compared to such HCV serine protease inhibitors and compounds having anti-HCV activity when used in pharmaceutically effective amounts. In addition, the present invention encompasses the use of combinations of HCV serine protease inhibitors and compounds having anti-HCV activity as described above to treat or prevent HCV infections, where one or more of these inhibitors or compounds is present in a pharmaceutically effective amount, and the other(s) is(are) present in a subclinical pharmaceutically-effective or anti-HCV effective amount(s) owing to their additive or synergistic effects. As used herein, the term \"additive effect\" describes the combined effect of two (or more) pharmaceutically active agents that is equal to the sum of the effect of each agent given alone. A synergistic effect is one in which the combined effect of two (or more) pharmaceutically active agents is greater than the sum of the effect of each agent given alone\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon improvement of a patient's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of this invention may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained when the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level, treatment should cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should also be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the judgment of the treating physician and the severity of the particular disease being treated. The amount of active ingredients will also depend upon the particular described compound and the presence or absence and the nature of the additional anti-viral agent in the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating a patient infected with a virus characterized by a virally encoded serine protease that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus by administering to said patient a pharmaceutically acceptable composition of this invention. Preferably, the methods of this invention are used to treat a patient suffering from a HCV infection. Such treatment may completely eradicate the viral infection or reduce the severity thereof. More preferably, the patient is a human being.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternate embodiment, the methods of this invention additionally comprise the step of administering to said patient an anti-viral agent preferably an anti-HCV agent. Such anti-viral agents include, but are not limited to, immunomodulatory agents, such as α-, β-, and γ-interferons, pegylated derivatized interferon-α compounds, and thymosin; other anti-viral agents, such as ribavirin and amantadine; other inhibitors of hepatitis C proteases (NS2-NS3 inhibitors and NS3-NS4A inhibitors); inhibitors of other targets in the HCV life cycle, including helicase and polymerase inhibitors; inhibitors of internal ribosome entry; broad-spectrum viral inhibitors, such as IMPDH inhibitors (the IMPDH inhibitors disclosed in United States Patent \n \n5,807,876\n \n, mycophenolic acid and derivatives thereof); or combinations of any of the above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch additional agent may be administered to said patient as part of a single dosage form comprising both a compound of this invention and an additional anti-viral agent. Alternatively the additional agent may be administered separately from the compound of this invention, as part of a multiple dosage form, wherein said additional agent is administered prior to, together with or following a composition comprising a compound of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment the present invention provides a method of pre-treating a biological substance intended for administration to a patient comprising the step of contacting said biological substance with a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a compound of this invention. Such biological substances include, but are not limited to, blood and components thereof such as plasma, platelets, subpopulations of blood cells and the like; organs such as kidney, liver, heart, lung, etc; sperm and ova; bone marrow and components thereof, and other fluids to be infused into a patient such as saline, dextrose, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another embodiment the invention provides methods of treating materials that may potentially come into contact with a virus characterized by a virally encoded serine protease necessary for its life cycle. This method comprises the step of contacting said material with a compound according to the invention. Such materials include, but are not limited to, surgical instruments and garments (e.g. clothes, gloves, aprons, gowns, masks, eyeglasses, footwear, etc.); laboratory instruments and garments (e.g. clothes, gloves, aprons, gowns, masks, eyeglasses, footwear, etc.); blood collection apparatuses and materials; and invasive devices, such as shunts, stents, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the compounds of this invention may be used as laboratory tools to aid in the isolation of a virally encoded serine protease. This method comprises the steps of providing a compound of this invention attached to a solid support; contacting said solid support with a sample containing a viral serine protease under conditions that cause said protease to bind to said solid support; and eluting said serine protease from said solid support. Preferably, the viral serine protease isolated by this method is HCV NS3-NS4A protease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order that this invention be more fully understood, the following preparative and testing examples are set forth. These examples are for the purpose of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples present preferred embodiments and techniques, but are not intended to be limiting. Those of skill in the art will, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific materials and methods which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHCV NS3 Protease HPLC Peptide Cleavage Assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay is a modification of that described by Landro et al. [\nLandro J.A. et al., Biochemistry, 36, pp. 9340-9348 (1997\n)]. A single peptide substrate (NS5AB), based on the NS5A/NS5B cleavage site for genotype 1a HCV, was used with all proteases. The substrate stock solution (25 mM) was prepared in DMSO containing 0.2M DTT and stored at -20°C. A synthetic peptide cofactor (KK4A) appropriate to each genotype was used as a substitute for the central core region of NS4A. Peptide sequences are shown below. The hydrolysis reaction was performed in a 96-well microtiter plate format using 25 nM to 50 nM HCV NS3 protease in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mM DTT and 25 µM KK4A. The final DMSO concentration was no greater than 2% v/v. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to yield a final TFA concentration of 2.5%. Enzymatic activity was assessed by separation of substrate and products on a reverse phase microbore HPLC column (Phenomenex Jupiter 5µ C18 300A column, 150x2.0 mm), which was heated to 40°C using a thermostated column chamber using an Agilent series 1100 instrument with autoinjection and diode array detection at 210 and 280 nm. The flow rate was 0.2 mL/min, with H\n2\nO/0.1% TFA (solvent A) and CH\n3\nCN/0.1% TFA (solvent B). A linear gradient was used; 5 to 60% solvent B over 12 minutes, then 60% to 100% solvent B over 1 min, 3 min isocratic, followed by 1 min to 5% solvent B and finished with 10 min post time using 5% solvent B isocratic. The SMSY product peak, which typically has a retention time of 10 min, was analyzed using the data collected at 210 nM.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPeptide Sequences Used with HCV NS3 protease\n \n \n \nGenotype\n \nPeptide\n \nSequence\n \n \n \n \nAll\n \nNS5AB\n \nNH\n2\n-EDW-(alpha)Abu-CSMSY-COOH\n \n \n \n1a\n \nKK4A\n \nNH\n2\n-KKGSVVIVGRIVLSGK-\nCOOH\n \n \n \n \n2a\n \nKK4A\n \nNH\n2\n-KKGSVSIIGRLHINQRA-\nCOOH\n \n \n \n \n3a\n \nKK4A\n \nNH\n2\n-KKGSVVIVGHIELGGKP-COOH\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor determination of the kinetic parameters Km and Vmax, the NS5AB substrate was varied between 3 µM and 200 µM.

All reactions were performed in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mM DTT and 25 µM KK4A (Buffer A), using the RET-S1 fluorescent peptide (AnaSpec, San Jose, CA) as substrate. Final DMSO concentrations were maintained at 1-2 % (v/v).

The reactions were quenched by the addition of 25 µL 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Enzymatic activity was assessed by separation of substrate and products on a reverse phase microbore HPLC column (Phenomenex Jupiter 5µ C18 300A column, 150×2.0 mm), which was heated to 40 °C using a thermostated column chamber using an Agilent series 1100 instrument with autoinjection and fluorescence detection with excitation at 350 nm and detection at 490 nm.

An aliquot of VX-950 dissolved in 100 % DMSO was added to the pre-heated enzyme stock at time zero. The reaction was initiated at time points ranging from 5 to 360 minutes by addition of a 5 µL aliquot of RET-S1 in Buffer A to a 95 µL aliquot of the enzyme-inhibitor mixture, yielding final concentrations of 4 µM RET-S1 and 5 nM to 20 nM HCV NS3 protease. The change in fluorescence was monitored over a 150 second window, and the rate of reaction was determined from a linear regression of the fluorescence vs. time data points. Control rates were determined from a reaction containing neat DMSO. Seven to eight concentrations of compound were used to titrate enzyme activity for inhibition. IC50 values were calculated from activity vs. inhibitor concentration data using a standard logistic 2 parameter fit. Under these assay conditions the IC50 for VX-950 inhibition of HCV NS3 protease following extended incubation is equivalent to the inhibition constant for the tightly bound enzyme/inhibitor complex.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nInhibition Constants for VX-950 with HCV NS3 Protease following Extended Incubation\n \n \n \nGenotype\n \nKi (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n1a\n \n \n10\n \n \n \n2a\n \n37\n \n \n \n3a\n \n460\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacterization of Inhibition from Progress Curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe rates of onset of slow binding inhibition were determined by a modification of the method for measurement of progress curves described by Narjes et al.

These \ngenotype\n 3 isolates include four from \ngenotype\n 3a (GenBank accession code AF046866, D17763, D28917, X76918) and two from \ngenotype\n 3b (GenBank accession code D49374 and D63821). The alignment of amino acid sequence of these six \ngenotype\n 3 HCV NS3 serine protease domains is shown in \nFig. 3\n. The consensus amino acid and nucleotide sequence of \ngenotype\n 3a NS3 serine protease domain is shown in \nFig. 4\n. Finally, an alignment of the consensus amino acid sequence of each genotype or \n \n \n \n \nsubgenotype\n \n \n \n \n 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a and 3b is shown in \nFig. 5\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPlasmid Construction\n. Amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the DNA fragment encoding residues Ala\n1\n-Ser\n181\n of several isolates of \n \ngenotype\n \n 2a or 2b were obtained from GenBank and aligned to identify a consensus sequence for \n \ngenotype\n \n 2a or 2b NS3 serine protease domain. The same applied to genotype 3a or 3b to identify a consensus sequence of \n \ngenotype\n \n 3a or 3b HCV NS3 serine protease domain. The cDNA fragments of these consensus sequences were created by oligonucleotide synthesis (Genscript) using the E. coli optimal codon usage, and then amplified by PCR and subcloned into pBEV11 for expression of the HCV proteins with a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag in E. coli. The amino acid #13 of the HCV NS3 serine protease, Leu was substituted with a Lys for a solubilizing variant. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExpression and purification of the HCV NS3 serine protease domain.\n Each of the expression constructs for the HCV NS3 serine protease domain of \n \ngenotype\n \n 2a or 3a was transformed into BL21/DE3 pLysS E. coli cells (Stratagene). Freshly transformed cells were grown.at 37°C in a BHI medium (Difco Laboratories) supplemented with 100 µg per ml carbenicillin and 35 µg per ml chloramphenicol to an optical density of 0.75 at 600 nM. Induction with 1 mM IPTG was performed for four hours at, 24°C. Cell pastes were harvested by centrifugation and flash frozen at -80°C prior to protein purification. All purification steps were performed at 4°C. For each of the HCV NS3 proteases, 100 g of cell paste was lysed in 1.5 L of buffer A [50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 0.1 % n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol] and stirred for 30 min. The lysates were homogenized using a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton, MA), followed by ultra-centrifugation at 54,000x g for 45 min. Imidazole was added to the supernatants to a final concentration of 5 mM along with 2 ml of Ni-NTA resin pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 5 mM imidazole. The mixtures were rocked for three hours and washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A plus 5 mM imidazole. The HCV NS3 proteins were eluted in buffer A containing 300 mM imidazole. The eluates were concentrated and loaded onto a Hi-Load 16/60 Superdex 200 column, pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The appropriate fractions of the purified HCV proteins were pooled and stored at -80°C.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHaving determined the consensus domain of the HCV genotypes, the NS3 serine protease domain protein was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. Enzyme assays for VX-950 were conducted with a KK-4A peptide (\nLandro et al., 1997 Biochemistry\n) and a FRET substrate (\nTaliani et al., 1997 Anal. Biochem.\n). The Ki* for VX-950 was determined using a steady state method and confirmed by two other methods (extended incubation and progress curves).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsolation of the consensus domain allowed a determination of the binding characteristics of VX-950 to the domain of HCV-1 as compared to HCV-2. The inventors showed that VX-950 has a several-fold better activity than other inhibitors that been described by those of skill in the art. The data obtained by the inventors show that the binding of VX-950 to the NS3-4A serine protease is a reversible, covalent, competitive, tight and slow binding. As such, this agent has a different mechanism of inhibitory action than other agents that are presently under development. For example, other agents were seen to bind to the protease and the binding was reversible, noncovalent, competitive and tight. More importantly, it was determined that at the binding site of \ngenotype\n 1 there is a Val-Asp-Gln at residues 78-80 and amino acid 56 whereas in genotype 2 there is a Ala-Glu-Gly. This difference in amino acids at those residues means that there is a lower conformational stability of the loop that is present in the serine protease in the HCV genotype as compared to the stability of the loop in the \nHCV genotype\n 1. While the lower conformational stability decreases the binding of some inhibitors, this decrease in conformational stability is expected to have little effect on the binding.of VX-950, making this inhibitor a more potent inhibitor of serine proteases from genotype 2 HCV. Similar results were seen with \ngenotype\n 3 HCV in which there is a substitution of Gln for the Asp168 that is \npresent genotype\n 1 HCV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile a number of embodiments of this invention have been described, it is apparent that the basic examples may be altered to provide other embodiments which utilize the compounds and methods of this invention.
