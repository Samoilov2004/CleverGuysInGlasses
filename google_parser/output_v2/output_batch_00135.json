(canceled) Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to the field of therapeutic peptides, i.e. to new protracted peptide derivatives such as Peptide YY (PYY) and Pancreatic Polypeptide (PP) derivatives.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nPYY is released during a meal from L-cells in the distal small intestine and the colon. PYY activates both the Y1, Y2, and Y5 receptor subtypes. The peptide PYY is known to have peripheral effects in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and also act centrally as a satiety signal. PYY is released as PYY(1-36) but is cleaved to PYY(3-36) which constitutes approx. 50% of the circulating PYY. The enzyme responsible for the degradation is dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV). PYY(3-36) displays selectivity for the Y2 receptor over the Y1, Y4, and Y5 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPP is a hormone secreted from the endocrine cells in pancreatic islets and release is stimulated by food intake. It acts preferably as an agonist of the Y4 receptor but also displays some affinity for the Y5 receptor. PP is known to reduce food-intake and potentially increase energy expenditure. The Y2 and the Y4 receptor subtypes are considered to be important regulators of food intake.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgonists that are selective for only the Y2 or the Y4 over the Y1 and Y5 receptors or agonists that are selective for both Y2 and Y4 receptors over the Y1 and Y5 receptors are considered beneficial for treatment of conditions such as obesity. In the design of such peptide drugs is important that the agonistic effect on the Y1 is relatively low, since this will lead to unwanted side effects (e.g., increased blood pressure). Furthermore, activation of the Y5 receptor is unwanted as this will increase food intake. However, the Y5 receptor is expressed in areas of the CNS where circulating peptides are not expected to gain access.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, PYY and PP are not optimal for use as pharmaceutical drugs due to the relative broad receptor binding specificity. PYY will act on the Y1 and Y5 receptors in addition to the Y2 receptor and PP will act on the Y5 receptor in addition to the Y4 receptor. Additionally, both PYY(3-36) and PP are rapidly degraded and display suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties, thus the peptides have to be administered at least once-daily or twice-daily. The half life of PYY(3-36) has been reported to be <30 minutes in pigs (Ito T et al, Journal of Endocrinology (2006), 191, pp 113-119) and the half-life of PP has been reported to be 7 minutes in man (Adrian T.

This attachment can be either covalent or non-covalent. By attaching fatty acids or analogues thereof to the peptide of interest it can bind non-covalently to albumin. This invention describes the design of peptides with attached novel side chains that strongly bind to albumin and prolong the duration of action of the peptide drug with the result that the peptide drug only has to be dosed once-daily or alternatively once-weekly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fatty acid albumin binders described herein are structurally different compared to previously published fatty acid albumin binders since these novel fatty acid analogues display a distal carboxylic group or a tetrazole group. This increases the albumin binding more than 10-fold compared to fatty acids that display a methyl group. This leads to peptide analogues that are considerably more protracted and will display once-weekly dosing profile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcylated peptides have previously been described, such as Levemir® (WO 95/07931) and Liraglutide (WO 98/08871). However, analogues of PYY or PP suitable for administration with lower frequency than once-daily administration would require the binding to serum albumin to be higher than exemplified with the above mentioned protein and peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect the invention provides a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof with an improved PK profile. In one aspect the invention provides a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof with an albumin binding side chain, optionally attached via a suitable spacer, displaying protracted properties making them suitable for administration with a frequency of once-daily or lower, such as in a once-weekly, twice-monthly, or once-monthly dosing regime. The albumin binding handle of this invention has a distal carboxylic acid or tetrazole group. In one aspect the albumin binding handle comprises a fatty di-acid. In one aspect the albumin binding handle is a fatty di-acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect the invention provides a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof with high affinity albumin binding effect. In one aspect high affinity albumin binding effect is defined as at least 10 times, such as at least 20 times, at least 50 times, or at least 100 times higher albumin binding of the PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof according to the invention relative to human PYY, PYY(3-36), or PP peptide or non-acylated analogues hereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect the invention provides a PYY or PP peptide derivative with improved bioavailability compared to other analogues described elsewhere in literature, such as human PYY, PYY(3-36), or PP peptide or non-acylated analogues hereof. In one aspect the invention provides a PYY or PP peptide derivative with improved oral bioavailability as opposed to other analogues describe elsewhere in the literature, such as human PYY, PYY(3-36), or PP peptide or non-acylated analogues hereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect the invention provides a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof with improved enzymatic stability as opposed to other analogues described elsewhere in the literature, such as human PYY, PYY(3-36), or PP peptide or non-acylated analogues hereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “agonist” means any compound that activates the target receptor and elicits one or more of the in vivo or in vitro effects elicited by the endogenous agonist for said receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Protracted properties” of a peptide is prolonged action of duration of the peptide which results in dosing with lower frequency, e.g., once-daily or alternatively once-weekly dosing. The protracted properties of PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof according to the invention could manifest as prolonged plasma half life or prolonged biological activity compared to the human PYY, PYY(3-36), or PP peptide or non-acylated analogues hereof. In one aspect the protraction of compounds of the invention is determined by monitoring the concentration thereof in plasma after s.c. or i.v. administration to animals, such as healthy pigs, using methods as described herein, such as the mini-pig PK assay. For comparison also the concentration in plasma of human PYY, PYY(3-36), PP peptide or non-acylated analogues hereof after s.c. or i.v. administration is followed. The protraction of other PYY, PYY(3-36), or PP compounds of the invention can be determined in the same way. In one aspect the protraction of compounds of the invention is determined by monitoring the duration of effect of the compounds in a biological assay such as an assay for food intake in mice, e.g. fasting induced refeeding assay, following s.c. administration of the compounds. For comparison also the duration of effect of human PYY(3-36), PP peptide or non-acylated analogues hereof after s.c. administration is followed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “human PYY” and “hPYY” or “human PP” and “hPP” are intended to mean PYY(1-36) according to SEQ ID NO: 1, or alternatively PYY(3-36) according to SEQ ID NO: 1 and with a deletion of the N terminal amino acids in \n \nposition\n \n 1 and 2, and PP(1-36) according to SEQ ID NO: 2, respectively. In one aspect the term PYY is intended to refer to human PYY. In one aspect the term PP is intended to refer to human PP.\n\n\n \nPeptide YY (PYY) and Pancreatic Peptide (PP)\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic peptide (PP) both belong to a group of peptides of the PP-fold family to which neuropeptide Y (NPY) also belongs. They are all homologous and naturally secreted as 36 amino acid peptides with a C-terminal amide. They are characterised by a common three-dimensional fold, the PP-fold, which is considered as a very stable structure. The amino acid sequence of human PYY(1-36) and human PP(1-36) are shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 and SEQ ID NO: 2, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe determinants for specificity of PYY towards the Y2 receptor is mainly located in the C-terminal part of the peptide. The determinants for specificity of PYY towards the Y1 receptor is located at both the N- and C-terminal. The peptide PYY(3-36) which is naturally occurring is relatively selective towards the Y2 over the Y1 and this peptide is currently in clinical trials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPP is selective towards the Y4 receptor and the determinants for this specificity is mainly located in the N-terminal part. The C-terminal part of PP differs mainly by one important residue compared to PYY. In PP the position 34 is a proline residue (Pro34) while in PYY this residue is a Gln (Gln34). It is known that mutating the Pro34 to a Gln34, PP will become Y2 selective in addition to Y4 specificity (J. Jorgensen et al, 1990, Eur. J. Pharm 186, 105-114). This dual-acting mechanism has been shown to give beneficial effects on appetite regulation and is thereby a potential treatment of obesity.\n\n\n \nPP-Fold Peptide Receptors\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect this invention relates to PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof which are selective for the Y4 receptor over the Y1, Y2 and Y5 receptors and have protracted pharmaco kinetic properties. In one aspect this invention relates to PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof which are selective for the Y2 receptor over the Y1, Y4, and Y5 receptors and have protracted pharmaco kinetic properties. In one aspect this invention relates to PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof which are selective for the Y2 and Y4 receptors over the Y1 and Y5 receptors and have protracted pharmaco kinetic properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect peptides being “selective” for specific receptors over other receptors refers to peptides that display at least 10 fold, such as at least 20 fold, at least 50 fold, or at least 100 fold higher potency for one Y receptor over other Y receptors as measured in vitro in an assay for receptor function, such as an assay for calcium mobilization, and compared by EC50 values.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPP-fold peptides or analogues thereof have been suggested for use in the treatment of obesity and associated diseases based on the demonstrated effects of certain of the these peptides in animal models and in man and on the fact that obese people have low basal levels of PP and PYY as well as lower meal responses of these peptides. Furthermore, both Y2 and Y4 agonists have been demonstrated to have anti-secretory and pro-absorptive effects in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The potential use of Y2 and Y4 agonists in the treatment of a number of gastrointestinal disorders has been suggested\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the treatment of conditions responsive to Y4 receptor modulation, such as obesity and intestinal hyper-secretion, it would be desirable to use protracted Y4 receptor selective agonists. The relatively short half-life of PP limits the therapeutic use of this peptide as a steady exposure level would require frequent dosing which would be highly inconvenient for the patients. As Y1 receptor activation can cause cardiovascular side effects and Y2 receptor activation can cause dose limiting nausea and vomiting it would be desirable to retain the Y4 receptor selectivity of the PP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor treatment of conditions responsive to Y2 receptor modulation such as obesity and intestinal hyper-secretion it would be desirable to use protracted Y2 receptor selective agonists. The relatively short half-life of PYY(3-36) limits the therapeutic use of this peptide as a steady exposure level would require frequent dosing which would be highly inconvenient for the patients. As Y1 and Y5 receptor activation can cause cardiovascular side effects and Y4 receptor activation could cause so far unknown side effects it would be desirable to retain the Y2 receptor selectivity of the PYY(3-36).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the treatment of conditions responsive to both Y2 and Y4 receptor modulation, such as obesity and intestinal hyper-secretion it would be desirable to use protracted dual acting Y2 and Y4 receptor selective agonists as an additive effect could be obtained from simultaneous activation of the Y2 and Y4 receptors compared to activation of the Y2 or Y4 receptors alone.\n\n\n \nAnalogues of PYY or PP Peptide\n\n\n \n \n \nThe term “analogue” as used herein referring to a peptide means a modified peptide wherein one or more amino acid residues of the peptide have been substituted by other amino acid residues and/or wherein one or more amino acid residues have been deleted from the peptide and/or wherein one or more amino acid residues have been added to the peptide and/or wherein one or more amino acid residues of the peptide have been modified. Such addition or deletion of amino acid residues can take place at the N-terminal of the peptide and/or at the C-terminal of the peptide. A simple nomenclature is used to describe the compounds according to the invention, for example, [Gln34]hPP(2-36) designates an analogue of the human PP, wherein the naturally occurring proline in position 34 has been substituted with Gln and the naturally occurring alanine in \nposition\n 1 has been deleted. The peptide may be derived from vertebrates, such as human, mouse, sheep, goat, cow, or horse. The term “vertebrate” means members of the subphylum Vertebrata, a primary division of the phylum Chordata that includes the fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, all of which are characterized by a segmented spinal column and a distinct well-differentiated head. The term “mammal” means humans as well as all other warm-blooded members of the animal kingdom possessed of a homeostatic mechanism in the class Mammalia, e.g., companion mammals, zoo mammals, and food-source mammals. Some examples of companion mammals are canines (e.g., dogs), felines (e.g., cats) and horses; some examples of food-source mammals are pigs, cattle, sheep, and the like. In one aspect the mammal is a human or a companion mammal. In one aspect the mammal is a human, male or female.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polypeptide” and “peptide” as used herein means a compound composed of at least five constituent amino acids connected by peptide bonds. All amino acids for which the optical isomer is not stated is to be understood to mean the L-isomer. However, also contemplated within the scope of the invention are D-amino acid residues of one or more of the amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe constituent amino acids of the peptides according to the invention may be from the group of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code and they may be natural amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code, as well as synthetic amino acids. Natural amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code are e.g., γ-carboxyglutamate, ornithine, phosphoserine, D-alanine and D-glutamine. Synthetic amino acids comprise amino acids manufactured by chemical synthesis, i.e. D-isomers of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code such as D-alanine and D-leucine, Aib (α-aminoisobutyric acid), Abu (α-aminobutyric acid), Tle (tert-butylglycine), β-alanine, 3-aminomethyl benzoic acid, anthranilic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 22 proteinogenic amino acids are: Alanine, Arginine, Asparagine, Aspartic acid, Cysteine, Cystine, Glutamine, Glutamic acid, Glycine, Histidine, Hydroxyproline, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Proline, Serine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Tyrosine, Valine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus a non-proteinogenic amino acid is a moiety which can be incorporated into a peptide via peptide bonds but is not a proteogenic amino acid. Examples are γ-carboxyglutamate, ornithine, phosphoserine, the D-amino acids such as D-alanine and D-glutamine, Synthetic non-proteogenic amino acids comprise amino acids manufactured by chemical synthesis, i.e. D-isomers of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code such as D-alanine and D-leucine, Aib (α-aminoisobutyric acid), Abu (α-aminobutyric acid), Tle (tert-butylglycine), 3-aminomethyl benzoic acid, anthranilic acid, des-amino-Histidine, the beta analogues of amino acids such as β-alanine etc., D-histidine, desamino-histidine, 2-amino-histidine, β-hydroxy-histidine, homohistidine, Nα-acetylhistidine, α-fluoromethyl-histidine, α-methyl-histidine, 3-pyridylalanine, 2-pyridylalanine or 4-pyridylalanine, (1-aminocyclopropyl) carboxylic acid, (1-aminocyclobutyl) carboxylic acid, (1-aminocyclopentyl) carboxylic acid, (1-aminocyclohexyl) carboxylic acid, (1-aminocycloheptyl) carboxylic acid, or (1-aminocyclooctyl) carboxylic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnnatural amino acids for use in the invention include, e.g., thiotyrosine, ornithine, 3-mercaptophenylalanine, 3- or 4-aminophenylalanine, 3- or 4-acetylphenylalanine, 2- or 3- hydroxyphenylalanine (o- or m-tyrosine), hydroxymethylglycine, aminoethylglycine, 1-methyl-1-mercaptoethylglycine, aminoethylthioethylglycine and mercaptoethylglycine. Many of the unnatural amino acids useful in the present invention are commercially available. Others may be prepared by methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the peptides of the invention are at least 34 amino acids in length. In other embodiments, the peptides may be at least 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, or 33 amino acids in length. Further, In one aspect, the peptides of the invention include only natural L-amino acid residues and/or modified natural L-amino acid residues. Alternatively, In one aspect, the peptides of the invention do not include unnatural amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn embodiments of the invention a maximum of 17 amino acids have been modified as compared to PYY (SEQ ID NO: 1) or PP (SEQ ID NO: 2). In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 15 amino acids have been modified as compared to PYY (SEQ ID NO: 1) or PP (SEQ ID NO: 2). In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 10 amino acids have been modified as compared to PYY (SEQ ID NO: 1) or PP (SEQ ID NO: 2). In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 8 amino acids have been modified as compared to PYY (SEQ ID NO: 1) or PP (SEQ ID NO: 2). In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 7 amino acids have been modified as compared to PYY (SEQ ID NO: 1) or PP (SEQ ID NO: 2). In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 6 amino acids have been modified as compared to PYY (SEQ ID NO: 1) or PP (SEQ ID NO: 2). In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 5 amino acids have been modified as compared to PYY (SEQ ID NO: 1) or PP (SEQ ID NO: 2). In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 4 amino acids have been modified as compared to PYY (SEQ ID NO: 1) or PP (SEQ ID NO: 2). In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 3 amino acids have been modified as compared to PYY (SEQ ID NO: 1) or PP (SEQ ID NO: 2). In embodiments of the invention a maximum of 2 amino acids have been modified as compared to PYY (SEQ ID NO: 1) or PP (SEQ ID NO: 2). In embodiments of the \ninvention\n 1 amino acid has been modified as compared to PYY (SEQ ID NO: 1) or PP (SEQ ID NO: 2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, peptides of the invention may exhibit at least 60%, 65%, 70%, 80%, or 90% sequence identity to a PYY(1-36), PYY(3-36), or PP(1-36) over the entire length of the PYY(1-36), PYY(3-36), or PP(1-36) respectively. In yet another embodiment, peptides of the invention may exhibit at least 50%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 80%, or 90% sequence identity to a NPY. As an example of a method for determination of sequence identity between two analogues the two peptides [Gln34]PP(1-36) and PP(1-36) are aligned. The sequence identity of Gln34 analogue relative to PP(1-36) is given by the number of aligned identical residues minus the number of different residues divided by the total number of residues in PP(1-36). Accordingly, in said example the sequence identity is (36-1)/36.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention relates to peptides comprising at least two PP-fold motifs, wherein the at least two PP-fold motifs include at least the N-terminal polyproline PP-fold motif and the C-terminal tail PP-fold motif, and the PP-fold peptide does not include any unnatural amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the peptides of the invention include PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof. In one aspect of the invention, the peptides of the invention include PP-fold chimeric peptides comprising a fragment of a PP, PYY or NPY peptide covalently linked to at least one additional fragment of a PP, PYY or NPY peptide, wherein each PP, PYY or NPY fragment includes a PP-fold motif.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, in one aspect, the present invention relates to PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof including one or more amino acid sequence modifications. Such modifications include substitutions, insertions, and/or deletions, alone or in combination. In a specific aspect, the PYY or PP peptides derivatives or analogues thereof of the invention include one or more modifications of a “non-essential” amino acid residue. In the context of the invention, a “non-essential” amino acid residue is a residue that can be altered, i.e., deleted or substituted, in the human PYY or PP amino acid sequence without abolishing or substantially reducing the PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof activity of the PYY or PP analogue peptide, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, the C-terminal of the derivative according to the invention may be terminated as either an acid or amide. In a specific aspect, the C-terminal of the derivative of the invention is an amide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitutions. In one aspect, the PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof of the invention may have one or more substitutions in the amino acid sequence of human PYY or PP, respectively, alone or in combination with one or more insertions or deletions. In one aspect, the substitution does not abolish or substantially reduce the PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof activity of the PYY or PP analogue peptide, respectively. In one aspect, the present invention relates to PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof that have a single substitution, or consecutive or non-consecutive substitution of more than one amino acid residues in the amino acid sequence of human PYY or PP, respectively. In one aspect, the PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof of the invention include one, two, or three amino acid substitutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the amino acid residues of human PYY at the helical C-terminus region of PYY (e.g., \n \nresidues\n \n 20, 24, 25, 27 and 29), the tail end residues (32-36), and/or the N-terminus prolines at \n \nposition\n \n 5 and 8 are not substituted. In one aspect, amino acid residues are not substituted at positions 32 through 36 of human PYY. In one aspect, amino acid residues of human PYY are not substituted at one or more amino acid sequence positions selected from: 5, 7, 8, 20, 24, 25, 27, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, and any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect amino acids may be substituted by conservative substitution. The term “conservative substitution” as used herein denotes that one or more amino acids are replaced by another, biologically similar residue. Examples include substitution of amino acid residues with similar characteristics, e.g. small amino acids, acidic amino acids, polar amino acids, basic amino acids, hydrophobic amino acids and aromatic amino acids. For example, in a preferred embodiment of the invention Met residues are substituted with norleucine (Nle) or with leucine, isoleucine or valine, which—as opposed to Met—are not readily oxidised. Another example of a conservative substitution with a residue normally not found in endogenous, mammalian peptides and proteins would be the conservative substitution of Arg or Lys with for example, ornithine, canavanine, aminoethylcysteine or other basic amino acid. For further information concerning phenotypically silent substitutions in peptides and proteins, see, for example, Bowie et. al. Science 247, 1306-1310, 1990.

In one aspect, the PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof of the invention may have one or more amino acid residues deleted from the amino acid sequence of human PYY or PP, respectively, alone or in combination with one or more insertions or substitutions. In one aspect, the PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof of the invention may have one or more amino acid residues deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus of human PYY or PP, respectively. In one aspect, the PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof of the invention may have one or more amino acid residues deleted at \namino acid positions\n 2 through 35 of human PYY or PP, respectively. Such deletions may include more than one consecutive or non-consecutive deletions at \namino acid positions\n 2 through 35 of human PYY or PP. In a preferred embodiment, the amino acid residues at \npositions\n 24 through 36 of human PYY or PP are not deleted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the PP-fold peptides of the invention may include N or C-terminal truncations, or internal deletions at \namino acid positions\n 2 to 35 so long as at least one biological activity of a native PP-fold peptide is retained. In preferred embodiments, the amino acid residues at \npositions\n 5 through 8 and 24 through 36, more specifically 5 through 8 and 32 through 35 are not deleted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsertions. In one aspect, the PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof of the invention may have one or more amino acid residues inserted into the amino acid sequence of human PYY or PP, respectively, alone or in combination with one or more deletions and/or substitutions. In one aspect, the present invention relates to PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof that have a single insertion, or consecutive or non-consecutive insertions of more than one amino acid residues into the amino acid sequence of human PYY or PP. In yet a further embodiment, one or more amino acids may be inserted at the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the peptide analogue. In yet a further embodiment, amino acid residues are not inserted at \npositions\n 24 through 36 of human PYY or PP, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof of the invention may include insertions of one or more unnatural amino acids and/or non-amino acids into the sequence of PYY or PP, respectively. In yet another embodiment, the unnatural amino acids inserted into the sequence of human PYY or PP may be beta-turn mimetics or linker molecules. Examples of linker molecules include aminocaproyl (“Aca”), beta-alanyl, and 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect the invention relates to PYY or PP mimetics characterised by a deletion of the residues 5-24 which are substituted by a linker such as but not restricted to: aminocaproyl (“Aca”), beta-alanyl, and 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoyl. In addition these mimics are stabilised, e.g., by a S—S by Cys in \nposition\n 2 and a D-Cys in position 27.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment PP-fold peptides are stabilised by a lactam bridge between a Lys and a Glu. As an example, but not restricted hereto, is a Lys in position 28 and Glu in position 32. In one aspect of the invention, the analogue of a PYY or PP peptide includes combinations of the above-described modifications, i.e., deletion, truncation, insertion, and substitution. In one aspect of the invention, the analogue of a PYY or PP peptide includes one, two, or three amino acid substitutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the PP sequence Asp10 is particularly prone to cyclisation in solution to form a cyclic imidate which ring opens to form mixtures of the alpha and beta-aspartate with concomitant scrambling of stereochemistry. In peptide pairs (v), (vi) and (viii) of the invention that residue has been replaced by Glu. This substitution preserves the special electrostatic potential distribution within the peptides and thereby the overall stability of the peptide as well as its solubility. Since Glu in \nposition\n 10 does not undergo analogues cyclisation/ring opening to form gamma-Glu it has the beneficial effect of improving the bulk and the solution stability of the peptide as a pharmaceutical agent compared to its \nAsp\n 10 counterparts. Improved solution stability leads to increased synthetic yields and reduces the requirement for troublesome, costly and waste producing purification of the desired product from the closely related beta-Asp impurity. In one aspect an albumin binding handle according to the invention may be attached to Asp10 in the PP sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the PYY or PP peptides of this invention Met may be substituted with a residue that is not prone to this alteration. For example, the Met 17 and \nMet\n 30 residues in the human PP sequence can potentially undergo oxidation upon storage in solution. Specifically, Met may be substituted with Nle which prevents oxidation at this position and preserves the aliphatic side chain structure as Nle is a bio-isostere for Met in the PYY or PP peptides of this invention. Also Leu, Ile and Val may be used as isosteres for Met. In addition the aliphatic alpha-helix promoting amino acids 1-aminocyclohexyl) carboxylic acid or 1-aminocyclopentyl) carboxylic acid may be used as a substitute for Met.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention enzymatic degradation of human PP is prevented by removal of Ala1 from the PP sequence, i.e. forming the analogue PP(2-36), whereby improving the stability of the peptide both in solution and as lyophilates and therefore improving their properties as pharmaceuticals. Alternatively, the Ala2 from the PP sequence may be substituted with the closely related Aib also improving the stability against DPPIV enzymatic cleavage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe various stability improving modifications presented above, taken singly or together represent a significant advance in the pharmaceutical properties of these peptides. Improved stability both during synthesis, leading to higher yields and less purification, and prolonged shelf life of the lyophilate and the solutions of these peptides reduces significantly the environmental burden of the production (and reducing the necessity for remanufacture) of peptides of this invention by reducing the use of raw materials, solvents, utilities and therefore also the production of waste products.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “DPP-IV protected” as used herein referring to a polypeptide means a polypeptide which has been chemically modified in order to render said derivative resistant to the plasma peptidase dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-4 (DPP-IV). The DPP-IV enzyme in plasma is known to be involved in the degradation of several peptide hormones, e.g. PYY, PP, etc. Thus, a considerable effort is being made to develop analogues and derivatives of the polypeptides susceptible to DPP-IV mediated hydrolysis in order to reduce the rate of degradation by DPP-IV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, the PYY or PP derivative is a DPPIV protected PYY or PP derivative. In one aspect of the invention, the said PYY or PP derivative is stabilised against DPP-IV degradation relatively to the stability of PYY or PP. In one aspect a derivative according to the invention is a DPP-IV protected derivative which is more resistant to DPP-IV than PYY or PP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResistance of a peptide to degradation by dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV is determined by the following degradation assay:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAliquots of the peptide (5 nmol) are incubated at 37° C. with 1 μl of purified dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV corresponding to an enzymatic activity of 5 mU for 10-180 minutes in 100 μl of 0.1 M triethylamine-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. Enzymatic reactions are terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 10% trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptide degradation products are separated and quantified using HPLC analysis. One method for performing this analysis is: The mixtures are applied onto a Vydac C18 widepore (30 nm pores, 5 μm particles) 250×4.6 mm column and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with linear stepwise gradients of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (0% acetonitrile for 3 min, 0-24% acetonitrile for 17 min, 24-48% acetonitrile for 1 min) according to Siegel et al., Regul. Pept. 1999; 79:93-102 and Mentlein et al. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214:829-35. Peptides and their degradation products may be monitored by their absorbance at 220 nm (peptide bonds) or 280 nm (aromatic amino acids), and are quantified by integration of their peak areas related to those of standards. The rate of hydrolysis of a peptide by dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV is estimated at incubation times which result in less than 10% of the peptide being hydrolysed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the resistance of a peptide to degradation by dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV is determined by the following degradation assay: Aliquots of the peptide (4 nmol) are incubated at 37° C. with 10.9 mU of purified dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV for 22 hours in 40 μl of 0.085 M Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, in presence or absence of 1.6% human serum albumin. After 0, 4, and 22 hours samples of 10 μl are taken and enzymatic reactions are terminated by mixing with 100 μl of 1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptide degradation products are separated and quantified using HPLC analysis. One method for performing this analysis is: The mixtures are applied onto an Agilent Zorbax 300SB-C18 (5 μm particles) 150×2.1 mm column and eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a linear gradient from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 100% acetonitrile with 0.07% TFA in 30 minutes. Peptides and their degradation products are monitored by their absorbance at 214 nm, and are quantified by integration of their peak areas. The stability of a peptide against dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV is determined as the peak area of the intact peptide relative to the sum of the peak areas of the intact peptide and the degradation product lacking the two aminoterminal amino acids after cleavage.\n\n\n \nDerivatives of PYY or PP Peptide or Analogues Thereof\n\n\n \n \n \nThe term “derivative” as used herein in relation to a peptide means a chemically modified peptide or an analogue thereof, wherein at least one substituent is not present in the unmodified peptide or an analogue thereof, i.e. a peptide which has been covalently modified.

The PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof of the invention may be used alone or in combination with at least one additional pharmaceutical agent that is useful in the treatment of the disease, condition or disorder or a co-morbidity of the disease, condition or disorder. Diseases, conditions, or disorders modulated by an Y2 and/or Y4 receptor agonist in mammals include obesity and being overweight. Co-morbidities of such diseases, conditions, or disorders would likely be incidentally improved by treatment of such diseases, conditions, or disorders. Further provided is a method of treating obesity in a mammal in need of such treatment, which comprises peripherally administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “therapeutically effective amount” of a compound refers to an amount sufficient to cure, alleviate, or partially arrest the clinical manifestations of a given disease and/or its complications with respect to appropriate control values determined prior to treatment or in a vehicle-treated group. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as a “therapeutically effective amount”. Effective amounts for each purpose will depend on the severity of the disease or injury, as well as on the weight and general state of the subject. It will be understood that determination of an appropriate dosage may be achieved using routine experimentation, by constructing a matrix of values and testing different points in the matrix, all of which is within the level of ordinary skill of a trained physician or veterinarian.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “treatment”, “treating” and other variants thereof as used herein refer to the management and care of a patient for the purpose of combating a condition, such as a disease or a disorder. The terms are intended to include the full spectrum of treatments for a given condition from which the patient is suffering, such as administration of the active compound(s) in question to alleviate symptoms or complications thereof, to delay the progression of the disease, disorder or condition, to cure or eliminate the disease, disorder or condition, and/or to prevent the condition, in that prevention is to be understood as the management and care of a patient for the purpose of combating the disease, condition, or disorder, and includes the administration of the active compound(s) in question to prevent the onset of symptoms or complications. The terms “treating”, “treat”, or “treatment” embrace both preventative, i.e., prophylactic, and palliative treatment. Also provided is a method of reducing weight or promoting weight loss (including preventing or inhibiting weight gain) in a mammal which comprises peripherally administering to the mammal a weight- controlling or weight-reducing amount of a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a method of reducing food intake in a mammal which comprises peripherally administering to the mammal a food-intake-reducing amount of a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a method of inducing satiety in a mammal which comprises peripherally administering to the mammal a satiety-inducing amount of a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a method of reducing caloric intake in a mammal which comprises peripherally administering to the mammal a calorie-intake-reducing amount of a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a method of reducing nutrient availability by administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof of the present invention. In one aspect a method of inhibition of food intake, slowing of gastric emptying, inhibition of gastric acid secretion, and inhibition of pancreatic enzyme secretion by administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof of the present invention is provided. In one aspect a method of treating or preventing metabolic diseases such as \ntype\n 1, \ntype\n 2, or gestational diabetes mellitus, obesity and other manifestations of insulin-resistance syndrome (Syndrome X) by administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof of the present invention is provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, a method is disclosed herein for altering energy metabolism in a subject. The method includes administering a therapeutically effective amount of an agonist of the invention to the subject, thereby altering energy expenditure. Energy is burned in all physiological processes. The body can alter the rate of energy expenditure directly, by modulating the efficiency of those processes, or changing the number and nature of processes that are occurring. For example, during digestion the body expends energy moving food through the bowel, and digesting food, and within cells, the efficiency of cellular metabolism can be altered to produce more or less heat. In one aspect a method is disclosed herein for any and all manipulations of the accurate circuitry described in this application, which alter food intake coordinately and reciprocally alter energy expenditure. Energy expenditure is a result of cellular metabolism, protein synthesis, metabolic rate, and calorie utilization. Thus, in this embodiment, peripheral administration results in increased energy expenditure, and decreased efficiency of calorie utilization. In one aspect, a therapeutically effective amount of a receptor agonist according to the invention is administered to a subject, thereby increasing energy expenditure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, methods for treating or preventing obesity are provided, wherein the method comprises administering a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof to a subject in need thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the subject is an obese or overweight subject. While “obesity” is generally defined as a body mass index over 30, for purposes of this disclosure, any subject, including those with a body mass index of less than 30, who needs or wishes to reduce body weight is included in the scope of “obese.” Subjects who are insulin resistant, glucose intolerant, or have any form of diabetes mellitus (e.g., \n \ntype\n \n 1, 2 or gestational diabetes) can benefit from this method. In one aspect of the invention, methods of reducing food intake, reducing nutrient availability, causing weight loss, affecting body composition, and altering body energy content or increasing energy expenditure, treating diabetes mellitus, and improving lipid profile (including reducing LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels and/or changing HDL cholesterol levels) are provided, wherein the methods comprise administering to a subject an effective amount of a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, the methods of the invention are used to treat or prevent conditions or disorders which can be alleviated by reducing nutrient availability in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof of the invention. Such conditions and disorders include, but are not limited to, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, eating disorders, insulin-resistance, obesity, and diabetes mellitus of any kind.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the effects of peripherally-administered PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof of the present invention in the reduction of food intake, in the delay of gastric emptying, in the reduction of nutrient availability, and in the causation of weight loss are determined by interactions with one or more unique receptor classes in, or similar to, those in the PP family. More particularly, it appears that a receptor or receptors similar to the PYY-preferring (or Y7) receptors are involved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional assays useful to the invention include those that can determine the effect of PP-fold compounds, such as PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof, on body weight and/or body composition. An exemplary assay can be one that involves utilization of a diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model for metabolic disease: 125 female CBA mice may be ordered from Charles River, Japan. At 5 weeks of age they arrive at Animal Unit, Novo Nordisk. The mice are on reversed day/night cycle. Mice #1-100 have ad libitum access to high fat diet D12309, Research Diet (60% kcal from fat). This diet has previously been shown to be effective in inducing obesity in CBA mice. In a first embodiment mice #101-125 are fed control diet (D12310) containing 11% kcal from fat. In a second embodiment mice #101-125 are fed control diet (D12450B) containing 10% kcal from fat. The mice are weighed on a weekly basis. When High fat fed mice (D12492 or D12309) have gained sufficient weight as compared to low fat diet mice (appr 15-20% overweight) they are used in the study. Based on body weight, outliers are removed and the remaining mice divided into groups aiming at obtaining similar body weights in the groups. Before starting the study all mice are scanned for body composition (NMR scan). One week before starting the study the mice are weighed daily to get a stable baseline and to acclimatize them to the procedure. The mice are divided into groups as follows;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 1 (n=10): s.c. dosing of PYY analogue (dosis 0.3 μmol/kg, 10 ml/kg)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 2 (n=10): s.c. dosing of PYY analogue (\ndosis\n 1 μmol/kg, 10 ml/kg)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 3 (n=10): s.c. dosing of PP analogue (dosis 0.3 μmol/kg, 10 ml/kg)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 4 (n=10): s.c. dosing of PP analogue (\ndosis\n 1 μmol/kg, 10 ml/kg)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 5 (n=10): s.c. dosing of human PYY(3-36) (\ndosis\n 1 μmol/kg, 10 ml/kg)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 6 (n=10): s.c. dosing of human PP (\ndosis\n 1 μmol/kg, 10 ml/kg)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 7 (n=10): s.c. dosing of vehicle\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup 8 (n=10): Low fat group as reference\n\n\n \n \nOne or more PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogue thereof as well as control compounds, such as human PYY, PYY(3-36), and human PP, are dissolved in 50 mM NaH2PO4, 165 mM NaCl, pH=7.4. Dosing is performed once daily at the same time point every day, shortly before lights off. As an alternative to s.c. administration some or all of the compounds can be delivered via Alzet osmotic minipumps. The pumps can be set to deliver any amount of the compounds, e.g., 1 μmol/kg/24 hours. The mice are dosed for 3 weeks. Body weight for all mice is recorded daily in combination with dosing. After 1 week and 3 weeks of treatment, the mice are scanned for body composition using a QNMR system (Echo Medical Systems, Houston, Tex.). Thereafter the mice are euthanized with cervical dislocation. Data are analysed in Graph Pad Prism. Statistical significance is assessed by comparing the groups with ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test. A p-value <0.05 is considered statistically significant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another assay ob/ob mice are used to analyze the effect of compounds of the invention on body weight and body composition. This assay is similar to the above described assay for DIO mice except that ob/ob mice (Taconic, Hudson, N.Y.) are used. These mice are maintained on a regular diet (Altromin 1324, Brogaarden, Denmark).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRespiratory quotient (RQ, defined as CO2 production divided by O2 consumption) and metabolic rate can be determined using whole-animal indirect calorimetry (Oxymax, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, Ohio). The mice can be euthanized by isoflurane overdose, and an index of adiposity (bilateral epididymal fat pad weight) measured. In the methods of the invention, preferred PP-fold peptides of the invention are those having a potency in one of the assays described herein (specifically food intake, gastric emptying, pancreatic secretion, weight reduction or body composition assays).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional assays useful in determining effect of PP-fold peptides are assays measuring acute food intake, such as the Fasting-induced refeeding assay:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcute food intake in mice: Lean C57BL male mice are obtained from Charles River, Japan. They are maintained on a 12:12 light:dark cycle (lights off at 10:00 AM, lights on at 10:00 PM), fed pelleted D12450B rodent diet (Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, N.J.), and allowed water ad libitum. The mice arrive at 7-8 weeks of age and are acclimatized in the BioDAQ system a minimum of two weeks prior to study. On the day of study, mice are 9-12 weeks old. They are fasted overnight (20-24 h) with free access to water. The day of the study, mice are dosed with s.c. injection (dose volume=10 mL/kg), returned to their cage, and pre-weighed food is immediately placed in the cage. The dosing vehicle used may be: 50 mM K2HPO4, 0.05\n% tween\n 80, pH=8.0 and dose is calculated for the test compound on a molar basis. Assay design:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe mice are fasted from 2:00 PM the day before dosing\n \nThe mice are weighed and dosed 30 minutes before the light is turned off at 10:00 AM.\n \nThe mice are dosed with 10 ml/kg s.c.\n \nThe mice are dosed once and the food-intake is monitored using the BioDAQ system (Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, N.J.) for 24 hours\n\n\nThe BioDAQ system consists of 32 mouse boxes each having a food-tray with a sensitive weight. When the mice eat the weight reduction of the content of the food-tray is registered. Data is registered each time there is a change in the weight of the individual food-tray. Cumulative food intake is calculated by subtracting the food weight at each time point from the starting food weight.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAcute food intake in rats: Lean male Sprague Dawley rats (˜180 g) are obtained from Taconic, Europe. Immediately after arrival and two weeks before dosing the rats are housed in reversed light cycle (dark from 10 am to 10 pm, 2 in each cage). The rats are fed regular diet (Altromin 1324, Brogaarden, Denmark). One week before dosing, rats are moved to the FeedWin system, where the rats are placed in individual cages for acclimatisation. The FeedWin system (Ellegårds Systems, Faaborg, Denmark) contains 32 stations for individual and continuous registration of food and water intakes. One station is defined by 1 cage with a metal lid plus 2 scales, one for food-intake and one for water-intake. Food and water intake is estimated by measurements of the disappearance of preloaded amounts of food and water that are placed on the 2 scales on each side of the cage. The day of the study rats are dosed before onset of dark with a s.c. injection (dose volume=1-2 mL/kg) and returned to their cage. After dosing water and food intake will be registered by the FeedWin system. Data will be collected each 15 minutes for 48 hours. Food consumptions for each group are calculated for the requested periods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcute food intake in pigs: Young female Landrace Yorkshire Duroc pigs are obtained from Gundsoegaard, Denmark. The animals are housed in a group for one week during acclimatisation. The animals are fed ad libitum with pig diet (Prima Antonio) at all times both during the acclimatisation and the experimental period. For measurement of individual food intake, the animals are placed in individual pens. Food intake is monitored on line by logging the weight of food every 15 minutes using the Mpigwin system (Ellegårds Systems, Faaborg, Denmark). The first day of the study (Monday morning) pigs are dosed with a s.c. injection (dose volume=0.025-0.04 mL/kg) and food intake is monitored for five days until end of study (Friday afternoon). Food consumptions for each group are calculated for the requested periods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn assay useful for measuring PK of the compounds of the invention is the mini-pig PK assay. Five male Göttingen mini-pigs weighing approximately 18 to 22 kg from Ellegaard Göttingen Minipigs A/S, Denmark were included in the study. The mini-pigs had two central venous catheters inserted which were used for intra venous (i.v.) dosing and bloodsampling. Compound was dissolved in 50 mM K2HPO4, 0.05\n% tween\n 80, pH=8.0 to a concentration of 180 nmol/ml. The pigs were dosed with 6 nmol compound/kg body weight. Blood samples were taken at the following time points: pre-dose, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168 and 240 hours post dosing. The blood samples were collected into test tubes containing EDTA buffer for stabilization and kept on ice for max. 20 minutes before centrifugation. The centrifugation procedure to separate plasma was; 4° C., 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. Plasma were collected and immediately transferred to Micronic tubes stored at −20° C. until assayed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn additional mini-pig PK assay was used for measuring PK of the compounds of the invention. Mini-pigs weighing 15 to 35 kg from Ellegaard Göttingen Minipigs A/S were included in the studies. The animals had two central venous catheters inserted which were used for intra venous (i.v.) dosing and blood sampling. Compounds were dissolved in 10 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01\n% tween\n 80, pH=4.0 to concentrations in the range of 40 nmol/ml to 200 nmol/ml. The mini-pigs were dosed i.v. with 10 nmol compound/kg body weight, occasionally other doses such as 4 nmol/kg, 30 nmol/kg or 50 nmol/kg were administered. Each compound was dosed to 3 or 4 mini-pigs, and two compounds may be given simultaneously to the same animal. Blood were sampled pre-dose and 12 times during the first 10 hours post-dose. Blood were furthermore sampled once daily until 13 days post dosing. The blood samples were collected into test tubes containing EDTA buffer, trasylol and Val-Pyr for stabilization and kept on ice for max. 20 minutes. Samples were centrifuged at 4° C., 2000G for 10 minutes to separate plasma. Plasma were collected and immediately transferred to Micronic tubes stored at −20° C. until assayed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma samples were analysed by LC-MS on an LTQ-Orbitrap (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen) to which Accela HPLC pumps and an autosampler were connected (both from ThermoFisher). The mass spectrometer was equipped with an electrospray interface, which was operated in positive ionisation mode. Analysis was conducted in selected ion monitoring mode at m/z 829.8±1.5 Da. The compound was detected at 829.4529 Da, which corresponded to [M+6H]6+ with an accuracy of 3.6 ppm. For quantification purposes, the six most intense isotope peaks were extracted with an accuracy of 5 ppm. HPLC was performed on a Jupiter Proteo column (4μ) 90A (50×2.0 mm ID). Mobile phases consisted of A. 0.1% formic acid and B. 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. A gradient was run from 10% B to 20% B from 0 to 0.2 min and then from 20% B to 34% B from 0.2 min to 6 min. The flow rate was 0.3 ml/min. For analysis of plasma samples, 30 μl plasma was precipitated with 90 μl ethanol. To 100 μl of the supernatant, 20 μl 95% acetonitrile (containing 5% formic acid) and 200 μl heptane were added. The heptane phase was removed after 5 min and the remaining solution was analysed by LC-MS as described above. For construction of plasma standards, compound was spiked to plasma (minipig) at the following concentrations: 1 nM, 2 nM, 5 nM, 10 nM, 20 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM, 200 nM. The plasma standards were treated as the samples. The lower limit of quantification was estimated to 2 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-compartmental analysis (NCA): Plasma concentration-time profiles were analyzed by non-compartmental pharmacokinetics analysis (NCA) using WinNonlin Professional 5.0 (Pharsight Inc., Mountain View, Calif., USA). NCA was performed using the individual plasma concentration-time profiles from each animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary assay for measurement of gastric emptying is described in the materials and methods section page 1326 under the headline “Gastric emptying” in (Asakawa A et al, Characterization of the effects of pancreatic polypeptide in the regulation of energy balance, Gastroenterology, 2003,124,1325-1336).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAppetite can be measured by any means known to one of skill in the art. For example, in humans, decreased appetite can be assessed by a psychological assessment. In such an embodiment, administration of the receptor agonist results in a change in perceived hunger, satiety, and/or fullness. Hunger can be assessed by any means known to one of skill in the art. In one aspect, hunger is assessed using psychological assays, such as by an assessment of hunger feelings and sensory perception using e.g. a questionnaire.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the amelioration of hypertension in subjects in need thereof as a result of reduced food intake, weight loss, or treating obesity, compounds of the invention may be used to treat hypotension.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention may also be useful for potentiating, inducing, enhancing or restoring glucose responsiveness in pancreatic islets or cells. These actions may be useful for treating or preventing conditions associated with metabolic disorders such as those described above and in U.S. patent application no. US20040228846. Assays for determining such activity are known in the art. For example, in published U.S. patent application no. US20040228846 (incorporated by reference in its entirety), assays are described for islet isolation and culture as well as determining fetal islet maturation. In the examples of patent application US20040228846, intestine-derived hormone peptides including pancreatic peptide (PP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), neuropeptide K (NPK), PYY, secretin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and bombesin were purchased from Sigma. Collagenase type XI was obtained from Sigma. RPMI 1640 culture medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Gibco. A radioimmunoassay kit containing anti-insulin antibody ([125I]-RIA kit) was purchased from Linco, St Louis. Post-partem rat islets were obtained from P-02 year old rats. Adult rat islets were obtained from 6-8 week old rats. Fetal rat islets were obtained as follows. Pregnant female rats were sacrificed on pregnancy day e21. Fetuses were removed from the uterus. 10-14 pancreata were dissected from each litter and washed twice in Hanks buffer. The pancreas were pooled, suspended in 6 \nml\n 1 mg/ml collagenase (Type XI, Sigma) and incubated at 37° C. for 8-10 minutes with constant shaking. The digestion was stopped by adding 10 volumes of ice-cold Hanks buffer followed by three washes with Hanks buffer. The islets were then purified by Ficoll gradient and cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)/RPMI medium with or without addition of 1 μM IBMX. At the end of five days, 20 islets were hand picked into each tube and assayed for static insulin release. Generally, islets were first washed with KRP buffer and then incubated with 1 ml of KRP buffer containing 3 mM (low) glucose for 30 minutes at 37 Degrees Centigrade with constant shaking. After collecting the supernatant, the islets were then incubated with 17 mM (high) glucose for one hour at 37 Degrees Centigrade The insulin released from low or high glucose stimulation were assayed by radioimmunoassay (RIA) using the [125I]-RIA kit. E21 fetal islets were cultured for 5 days in the presence of 200 ng/ml PYY, PP, CCK, NPK, NPY, Secretin, GLP-I or Bombesin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary in vivo assay is also provided using the Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) male rat, an inbred (>F30 Generations) rat model that spontaneously expresses diabetes in all fa/fa males fed a standard rodent diet Purina 5008. In ZDF fa-fa males, hyperglycemia begins to develop at about seven weeks of age and glucose levels (fed) typically reach 500 mg/DL by 10 to 11 weeks of age. Insulin levels (fed) are high during the development of diabetes. However, by 19 weeks of age insulin drops to about the level of lean control litter mates. Triglyceride and cholesterol levels of obese rats are normally higher than those of leans. In the assay, three groups of 7- week old ZDF rats, with 6 rats per group, received the infusion treatment by Alzet pump for 14 days: 1) vehicle control, 2) and 3), PYY with two different doses, 100 μmol/kg/h and 500 μmol/kg/h respectively. Four measurements were taken before the infusion and after the infusion at day 7 and day 14: 1) plasma glucose level, 2) plasma insulin level, and 3) plasma triglycerides (TG) level, as well as oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) test. Accordingly, these assays can be used with compounds of the invention to test for desired activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention may be used in the treatment of anxiety. A method of measuring for an effect of an administrated peptide on anxiety-like behaviour by the elevated plus maze test is described in the material and methods section page 1327 under the headline “Repeated administrations” in (Asakawa A et al, Characterization of the effects of pancreatic polypeptide in the regulation of energy balance, Gastroenterology, 2003, 124, 1325-1336).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention may be used in the treatment of rhinitis of any origin.

The compounds may suppress gastrointestinal secretions by direct interaction with epithelial cells or, perhaps, by inhibiting secretion of hormones or neurotransmitters which stimulate intestinal secretion. Anti-secretory properties include inhibition of gastric and/or pancreatic secretions and can be useful in the treatment or prevention of diseases and disorders including gastritis, acute pancreatitis, Barrett's esophagus, and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention are useful in the treatment of any number of gastrointestinal disorders (see e.g., Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, McGraw-Hill Inco, New York, 12th Ed.) that are associated with excess intestinal electrolyte and water secretion as well as decreased absorption, e.g., infectious diarrhoea, inflammatory diarrhoea, short bowel syndrome, or the diarrhoea which typically occurs following surgical procedures, e.g., ileostomy. Examples of infectious diarrhoea include, without limitation, acute viral diarrhoea, acute bacterial diarrhoea (e.g., salmonella, \nCampylobacter\n, and \nClostridium \nor due to protozoal infections), or traveller's diarrhoea (e.g., Norwalk virus or rotavirus). Examples of inflammatory diarrhoea include, without limitation, malabsorption syndrome, tropical sprue, chronic pancreatitis, Crohn's disease, diarrhoea, and irritable bowel syndrome. It has also been discovered that the peptides of the invention can be used to treat an emergency or life-threatening situation involving a gastrointestinal disorder, e.g., after surgery or due to cholera. A method of measuring intestinal electrolyte secretion is described on page 1250 of (Eto B et al Comparison of the antisecretory effect of endogenous forms of peptide YY on fed and fasted rat jejunum. Peptides. 1997; 18(8):1249-55).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention may also be useful for treating or preventing intestinal damage as opposed to merely treating the symptoms associated with the intestinal damage (for example, diarrhoea). Such damage to the intestine may be, or a result of, chemotherapy-induced diarrhoea, ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, bowel atrophy, loss bowel mucosa, and/or loss of bowel mucosal function (see WO 03/105763, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Assays for such activity, as described in WO 03/105763, include 11 week old male HSD rats, ranging 250-300 grams housed in a 12:12 lightdark cycle, and allowed ad libitum access to a standard rodent diet (Teklad L M 485, Madison, Wis.) and water. The animals were fasted for 24 hours before the experiment. A simple and reproducible rat model of chronic colonic inflammation has been previously described by Morris G P, et al., “Hapten-induced model of chronic inflammation and ulceration in the rat colon.” Gastroenterology. 1989; 96:795-803. It exhibits a relatively long duration of inflammation and ulceration, affording an opportunity to study the pathophysiology of colonic inflammatory disease in a specifically controlled fashion, and to evaluate new treatments potentially applicable to inflammatory bowel disease in humans. Rats were anesthetized with 3% isofluorane and placed on a regulated heating pad set at 37 Degrees Centigrade A gavage needle was inserted rectally into the colon 7 cm. The hapten trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) dissolved in 50% ethanol (v/v) was delivered into the lumen of the colon through the gavage needle at a dose of 30 mg/kg, in a total volume of 0 0.4-0.6 mL, as described in Mazelin, et al., “Protective role of vagal afferents in experimentally-induced colitis in rats.” Juton Nery Syst. 1998; 73:38 45. Control groups received saline solution (NaCl 0.9%) intracolonically. Four days after induction of colitis, the colon was resected from anesthetized rats, which were then euthanized by decapitation. Weights of excised colon and spleen were measured, and the colons photographed for scoring of gross morphologic damage. Inflammation was defined as regions of hyperemia and bowel wall thickening.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Y4 receptor selective agonists of the invention are of value in the treatment of constipation. The frequency of bowel movements, a measure of constipation, can be measured by any means known to one of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nY4 selective agonists are also of value in the treatment of diarrhoea or hypersecretion from intestinal stomia, and in the treatment of nausea or emesis, or as antinausea or antiemetic agents or co-treatment with drugs prone to cause nausea and/or emesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Y4 selective compounds of the present invention, and PP itself, are also useful for the treatment or protection against emesis and nausea.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention an acute test may be performed where a compound of the invention is administered to ensure that these compounds have the intended effect in the subject to be treated before a chronic treatment is started. Through these means it is ensured that only subjects who are susceptible to treatment with a compound of the invention are treated with these compounds.\n\n\n \n \nIn one aspect the invention relates to a method of treatment of a condition responsive to Y receptor modulation by administration of a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof as defined herein.

Preparation of Cells\n\n \n \n \n \n \n1. Adherent Y receptor and Gqi5 double stable CHO cells maintained in DMEM-F12 with appropriate antibiotics are plated in 96-well poly-D-lysine-coated microplates to near confluence and grown overnight.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nB. Preparation of Reagents\n\n \n \n \n \n \n2. A 250 mM (100×) stock of probenecid acid (Invitrogen #P36400) is made and dissolved in 1 ml assay buffer.\n \n3. The dye loading solution is prepared (for one microplate): 10 ml of assay buffer and 100 μl of probenecid acid (final concentration: 2.5 mM) stock solution is added to a vial of dye loading mix (provided in the kit). Vortex vigorously.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nC. Assay\n\n \n \n \n \n \n4. 100 μl of the dye loading solution is added to each well of a 96-well plate containing cells in 100 μl media (or other buffers depending on the ligand to be tested). The cells are placed in the 37° C./5% CO\n2 \nincubator. The cells are incubated for 1 hour prior to the assay.\n \n5. During the incubation of cells in dye mixture, a solution is prepared of receptor agonist (5×) in HBSS/HEPES: Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (1×) with 20 mM HEPES, 0.01% NaN\n3\n, pH 7.4 (with 0.1% BSA if using peptide as ligand). A serial dilution is made in 96-well compound plate (VWR #62409-108, NUNC, V-bottom).\n \n6. 1 hour after the addition of dye mixture to the cells, fluorescence is measured using a FLIPR (FLIPRtetra from Molecular Devices, CA, USA).\n\n\nDeterminations are made in triplicates. EC50 values were calculated using a standard pharmacological data handling software, Prism 5.0 (graphPad Sofware, San Diego, USA).\n\n \n \n \n\n\nMeasuring Y2 or Y4 Receptor Activity Using ACTOne Based FLIPR Assay:\n\n\n \n \n \nACTOne™ is an easily scaleable cAMP biosensor HTS platform for measurement of Gs and Gi coupled 7™ receptor signalling from BD Biosciences (San Jose, Calif.). The cells express a biosensor developed around a modified rat olfactory cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) calcium channel—a fairly non-discriminatory ion channel that responds to cAMP and cGMP. The CNG has been engineered to be cAMP selective and thus function as a cAMP responsive biosensor that signals through calcium or membrane potential responsive dyes. Y2 or Y4 receptor expressing ACTOne HEK-293 cells are obtained from BD Biosciences. The cells are loaded with a calcium responsive dye that only distributes in the cytoplasm. Probenecid, an inhibitor of the organic anion transporter is added to prevent the dye from leaving the cell. A phosphodiesterase inhibitor is added to prevent formatted cAMP from being degraded. Isoproterenol (an β1/β2 agonist) is added to activate the adenylate cyclase. When an Y2 or Y4 receptor agonist is added, the adenylate cyclase is inactivated. The decreased calcium concentration in the cytoplasm is then detected as an increase in fluorescence. Together with the test substance, Isoproterenol at a concentration matching EC\n80\n, is added to all wells.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe cells are plated out in Greiner 384-well plates. 25 μl cell suspension containing 560 cells per μl are added to all wells using the Multidrop™ (384-Multidrop from Labsystems, Finland).\n \nThe cell plates are then incubated in the incubator over night at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2 \nin stacks of up to 9 plates.\n \nThe cell plates are loaded with 25 μl probe from the FLIPR calcium4 kit (Molecular Devices, CA, USA) using the Multidrop™.\n \nThe cell plates are returned to the incubator and incubated for 60 min. at 37° C. in stacks of up to 9 plates.\n \nThe cell plates are then left at room temperature for 60 min., before use, without stacking the plates. The plates are covered with tinfoil to avoid light (the dye can be excited by the daylight, which results in higher baseline and variation).\n \nThe FLIPR (FLIPRtetra from Molecular Devices, CA, USA) adds 1 μl sample and 1 μl isoproterenol (0.05 μM final concentration) at the same time.\n \nThe fluorescence signal from the wells is measured 330 seconds after sample addition on the FLIPR.\n \n \n \n\n\nAdministration and Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nAnother object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a derivative according to the present invention which is present in a concentration from 0.1 mg/ml to 25 mg/ml, and wherein said formulation has a pH from 3.0 to 9.0.

The use of a stabilizer in pharmaceutical compositions is well-known to the skilled person. For convenience reference is made to Remington: \nThe Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n19\nth \nedition, 1995.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may further comprise an amount of an amino acid base sufficient to decrease aggregate formation by the polypeptide during storage of the composition. By “amino acid base” is intended an amino acid or a combination of amino acids, where any given amino acid is present either in its free base form or in its salt form. Where a combination of amino acids is used, all of the amino acids may be present in their free base forms, all may be present in their salt forms, or some may be present in their free base forms while others are present in their salt forms. In one aspect, amino acids to use in preparing the compositions of the invention are those carrying a charged side chain, such as arginine, lysine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid. Any stereoisomer (i.e., L, D, or a mixture thereof) of a particular amino acid (e.g. methionine, histidine, imidazole, arginine, lysine, isoleucine, aspartic acid, tryptophan, threonine and mixtures thereof) or combinations of these stereoisomers, may be present in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention so long as the particular amino acid is present either in its free base form or its salt form. In one aspect the L-stereoisomer is used. Compositions of the invention may also be formulated with analogues of these amino acids. By “amino acid analogue” is intended a derivative of the naturally occurring amino acid that brings about the desired effect of decreasing aggregate formation by the polypeptide during storage of the liquid pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Suitable arginine analogues include, for example, aminoguanidine, ornithine and N-monoethyl L-arginine, suitable methionine analogues include ethionine and buthionine and suitable cysteine analogues include S-methyl-L cysteine. As with the other amino acids, the amino acid analogues are incorporated into the compositions in either their free base form or their salt form. In one aspect of the invention the amino acids or amino acid analogues are used in a concentration, which is sufficient to prevent or delay aggregation of the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, methionine (or other sulphuric amino acids or amino acid analogues) may be added to inhibit oxidation of methionine residues to methionine sulfoxide when the polypeptide acting as the therapeutic agent is a polypeptide comprising at least one methionine residue susceptible to such oxidation. By “inhibit” is intended minimal accumulation of methionine oxidized species over time. Inhibiting methionine oxidation results in greater retention of the polypeptide in its proper molecular form. Any stereoisomer of methionine (L or D) or combinations thereof can be used. The amount to be added should be an amount sufficient to inhibit oxidation of the methionine residues such that the amount of methionine sulfoxide is acceptable to regulatory agencies. Typically, this means that the composition contains no more than about 10% to about 30% methionine sulfoxide. Generally, this can be achieved by adding methionine such that the ratio of methionine added to methionine residues ranges from about 1:1 to about 1000:1, such as 10:1 to about 100:1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, the formulation further comprises a stabilizer selected from the group of high molecular weight polymers or low molecular compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention the stabilizer is selected from polyethylene glycol (e.g. PEG 3350), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinylpyrrolidone, carboxy-/hydroxycellulose or derivates thereof (e.g. HPC, HPC-SL, HPC-L and HPMC), cyclodextrins, sulphur-containing substances as monothioglycerol, thioglycolic acid and 2-methylthioethanol, and different salts (e.g. sodium chloride). Each one of these specific stabilizers constitutes an alternative aspect of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise additional stabilizing agents, which further enhance stability of a therapeutically active polypeptide therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStabilizing agents of particular interest to the present invention include, but are not limited to, methionine and EDTA, which protect the polypeptide against methionine oxidation, and a nonionic surfactant, which protects the polypeptide against aggregation associated with freeze-thawing or mechanical shearing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, the formulation further comprises a surfactant. In one aspect of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprises two different surfactants. The term “surfactant” as used herein refers to any molecules or ions that are comprised of a water-soluble (hydrophilic) part, the head, and a fat-soluble (lipophilic) segment. Surfactants accumulate specifically at interfaces, which the hydrophilic part is orientated towards the water (hydrophilic phase) and the lipophilic part towards the oil- or hydrophobic phase (i.e. glass, air, oil etc.).

Marcel Dekker, New York, 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParenteral administration may be performed by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or intravenous injection by means of a syringe, optionally a pen-like syringe. Alternatively, parenteral administration can be performed by means of an infusion pump. A further option is a composition which may be a solution or suspension or a powder for the administration of the derivative of the present invention in the form of a nasal or pulmonal liquid or powder spray. As a still further option, the pharmaceutical compositions containing the derivative of the invention can also be adapted to transdermal administration, e.g. by needle-free injection or from a patch, optionally an iontophoretic patch, or transmucosal, e.g. buccal, administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “stabilized formulation” refers to a formulation with increased physical stability, increased chemical stability or increased physical and chemical stability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “physical stability” of the protein formulation as used herein refers to the tendency of the protein to form biologically inactive and/or insoluble aggregates of the protein as a result of exposure of the protein to thermo-mechanical stresses and/or interaction with interfaces and surfaces that are destabilizing, such as hydrophobic surfaces and interfaces. Physical stability of the aqueous protein formulations is evaluated by means of visual inspection and/or turbidity measurements after exposing the formulation filled in suitable containers (e.g. cartridges or vials) to mechanical/physical stress (e.g. agitation) at different temperatures for various time periods. Visual inspection of the formulations is performed in a sharp focused light with a dark background. The turbidity of the formulation is characterized by a visual score ranking the degree of turbidity for instance on a scale from 0 to 3 (a formulation showing no turbidity corresponds to a \nvisual score\n 0, and a formulation showing visual turbidity in daylight corresponds to visual score 3). A formulation is classified physical unstable with respect to protein aggregation, when it shows visual turbidity in daylight. Alternatively, the turbidity of the formulation can be evaluated by simple turbidity measurements well-known to the skilled person. Physical stability of the aqueous protein formulations can also be evaluated by using a spectroscopic agent or probe of the conformational status of the protein. The probe is specifically a small molecule that preferentially binds to a non-native conformer of the protein. One example of a small molecular spectroscopic probe of protein structure is Thioflavin T. Thioflavin T is a fluorescent dye that has been widely used for the detection of amyloid fibrils. In the presence of fibrils, and perhaps other protein configurations as well, Thioflavin T gives rise to a new excitation maximum at about 450 nm and enhanced emission at about 482 nm when bound to a fibril protein form. Unbound Thioflavin T is essentially non-fluorescent at the wavelengths.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther small molecules can be used as probes of the changes in protein structure from native to non-native states. For instance the “hydrophobic patch” probes that bind preferentially to exposed hydrophobic patches of a protein. The hydrophobic patches are generally buried within the tertiary structure of a protein in its native state, but become exposed as a protein begins to unfold or denature. Examples of these small molecular, spectroscopic probes are aromatic, hydrophobic dyes, such as anthracene, acridine, phenanthroline or the like. Other spectroscopic probes are metal-amino acid complexes, such as cobalt metal complexes of hydrophobic amino acids, such as phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, and valine, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “chemical stability” of the protein formulation as used herein refers to chemical covalent changes in the protein structure leading to formation of chemical degradation products with potential less biological potency and/or potential increased immunogenic properties compared to the native protein structure. Various chemical degradation products can be formed depending on the type and nature of the native protein and the environment to which the protein is exposed. Elimination of chemical degradation can most probably not be completely avoided and increasing amounts of chemical degradation products is often seen during storage and use of the protein formulation as well-known by the person skilled in the art. Most proteins are prone to deamidation, a process in which the side chain amide group in glutaminyl or asparaginyl residues is hydrolysed to form a free carboxylic acid. Other degradations pathways involves formation of high molecular weight transformation products where two or more protein molecules are covalently bound to each other through transamidation and/or disulfide interactions leading to formation of covalently bound dimer, oligomer and polymer degradation products (\nStability of Protein Pharmaceuticals\n, Ahern. T. J. & Manning M. C., Plenum Press, New York 1992). Oxidation (of for instance methionine residues) can be mentioned as another variant of chemical degradation. The chemical stability of the protein formulation can be evaluated by measuring the amount of the chemical degradation products at various time-points after exposure to different environmental conditions (the formation of degradation products can often be accelerated by for instance increasing temperature). The amount of each individual degradation product is often determined by separation of the degradation products depending on molecule size and/or charge using various chromatography techniques (e.g. SEC-HPLC and/or RP-HPLC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHence, as outlined above, a “stabilized formulation” refers to a formulation with increased physical stability, increased chemical stability or increased physical and chemical stability. In general, a formulation must be stable during use and storage (in compliance with recommended use and storage conditions) until the expiration date is reached.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, the pharmaceutical formulation comprising the derivative of the present invention is stable for more than 6 weeks of usage and for more than 3 years of storage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, the pharmaceutical formulation comprising the derivative of the present invention is stable for more than 4 weeks of usage and for more than 3 years of storage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, the pharmaceutical formulation comprising the derivative of the present invention is stable for more than 4 weeks of usage and for more than two years of storage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, the pharmaceutical formulation comprising the derivative of the present invention is stable for more than 2 weeks of usage and for more than two years of storage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe treatment with a derivative according to the present invention may also be combined with a second or more pharmacologically active substances, e.g. selected from antidiabetic agents, antiobesity agents, appetite regulating agents, antihypertensive agents, agents for the treatment and/or prevention of complications resulting from or associated with diabetes and agents for the treatment and/or prevention of complications and disorders resulting from or associated with obesity. Examples of these pharmacologically active substances are: Insulin, sulphonylureas, biguanides, meglitinides, glucosidase inhibitors, glucagon antagonists, DPP-IV (dipeptidyl peptidase-IV) inhibitors, inhibitors of hepatic enzymes involved in stimulation of gluconeogenesis and/or glycogenolysis, glucose uptake modulators, compounds modifying the lipid metabolism such as anti-hyperlipidemic agents as HMG CoA inhibitors (statins), Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptides (GIP analogues), compounds lowering food intake, RXR agonists and agents acting on the ATP-dependent potassium channel of the β-cells; Cholestyramine, colestipol, clofibrate, gemfibrozil, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, probucol, dextrothyroxine, neteglinide, repaglinide; β-blockers such as alprenolol, atenolol, timolol, pindolol, propranolol and metoprolol, ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) inhibitors such as benazepril, captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, alatriopril, quinapril and ramipril, calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, felodipine, nicardipine, isradipine, nimodipine, diltiazem and verapamil, and α-blockers such as doxazosin, urapidil, prazosin and terazosin; CART (cocaine amphetamine regulated transcript) agonists, NPY (neuropeptide Y) antagonists, PYY agonists, Y2 receptor agonists, Y4 receptor agonists, mixed Y2/Y4 receptor agonists, Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, amylin receptor agonists, MC4 (melanocortin 4) agonists, orexin antagonists or agonists, TNF (tumor necrosis factor) agonists, CRF (corticotropin releasing factor) agonists, CRF BP (corticotropin releasing factor binding protein) antagonists, urocortin agonists, β3 agonists, oxyntomodulin and analogues, MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) agonists, MCH (melanocyte-concentrating hormone) antagonists, CCK (cholecystokinin) agonists, serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors, mixed serotonin and noradrenergic compounds, 5HT (serotonin) agonists, bombesin agonists, galanin antagonists, growth hormone, growth hormone releasing compounds, TRH (thyreotropin releasing hormone) agonists, UCP 2 or 3 (uncoupling protein 2 or 3) modulators, leptin agonists, DA agonists (bromocriptin, doprexin), lipase/amylase inhibitors, RXR (retinoid X receptor) modulators, TR β agonists; histamine H3 antagonists, Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide agonists or antagonists (GIP analogues), gastrin and gastrin analogues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that any suitable combination of the derivatives according to the invention with one or more of the above-mentioned compounds and optionally one or more further pharmacologically active substances are considered to be within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof as well as compositions according to the invention can be administered by any route, including the enteral (e.g. oral administration) or parenteral route.

A person skilled in the art will know how to choose a suitable administration route. In one aspect, the administration is via the parenteral administration route. In one aspect, the PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof are administered subcutaneously and/or nasally. It is well known in the art that subcutaneous injections can be easily self-administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “peripheral administration” means administration outside of the central nervous system. Peripheral administration does not include direct administration to the brain. Peripheral administration includes, but is not limited to intravenous, intravascular, intramuscular, subcutaneous, pulmonary, oral, sublingual, enteral, rectal, transdermal, or intra-nasal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “solvate” refers to a complex of defined stoichiometry formed between a solute (in casu, a compound according to the present invention) and a solvent. Solvents may include, by way of example, water, ethanol, or acetic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof can be administered as such dispersed in a suitable vehicle or they can be administered in the form of a suitable composition. Such compositions are also within the scope of the invention. In the following are described suitable pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof according to the invention may be in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising the specific PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof together with one or more physiologically or pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable” as used herein means suited for normal pharmaceutical applications, i.e. giving rise to no serious adverse events in patients etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “excipient” as used herein means the chemical compounds which are normally added to pharmaceutical compositions, e.g. buffers, tonicity agents, preservatives and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition comprising a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof according to the invention may be in the form of a solid, semi-solid or fluid composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFluid compositions, which are sterile solutions or dispersions can be utilized by for example intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, epidural, intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection of infusion. The PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof may also be prepared as a sterile solid composition, which may be dissolved or dispersed before or at the time of administration using e.g. sterile water, saline or other appropriate sterile injectable medium. The fluid form of the composition may be a solution, an emulsion including nano- emulsions, a suspension, a dispersion, a liposomal composition, a mixture, a spray, or an aerosol (the two latter types are especially relevant for nasal administration).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable mediums for solutions or dispersions are normally based on water or pharmaceutically acceptable solvents e.g. like an oil (e.g. sesame or peanut oil) or an organic solvent like e.g. propanol or isopropanol. A composition according to the invention may comprise further pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as, e.g., pH adjusting agents, osmotically active agents e.g. in order to adjust the isotonicity of the composition to physiologically acceptable levels, viscosity adjusting agents, suspending agents, emulsifiers, stabilizers, preservatives, antioxidants etc. In one aspect, the medium is water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for nasal administration may also contain suitable non-irritating vehicles such as, e.g., polyethylene glycols, glycofurol, etc. as well as absorption enhancers well known by a person skilled in the art (e.g. with reference to Remington's Pharmaceutical Science).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor parenteral administration, in one aspect the PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof can be formulated generally by mixing it at the desired degree of purity, in a unit dosage injectable form (solution, suspension, or emulsion), with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier, i.e., one that is non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and is compatible with other ingredients of the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the formulations are prepared by contacting the PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof uniformly and intimately with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both. Then, if necessary, the product is shaped into the desired formulation. Specifically the carrier is a parenteral carrier, more specifically a solution that is isotonic with the blood of the recipient. Examples of such carrier vehicles include water, saline, Ringer's solution, and dextrose solution. Non-aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils and ethyl oleate are also useful herein, as well as liposomes. Due to the amphiphatic nature of the PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof described herein suitable forms also include micellar formulations, liposomes and other types of formulations comprising one or more suitable lipids such as, e.g., phospholipids and the like. In one aspect, they are suspended in an aqueous carrier, for example, in an isotonic buffer solution at a pH of about 3.0 to about 8.0, specifically at a pH of about 3.5 to about 7.4, 3.5 to 6.0, or 3.5 to about 5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may also be designed to controlled or prolonged delivery of the PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof after administration in order to obtain a less frequent administration regimen. Normally a dosage regimen including 1-2 daily administrations is considered suitable, but within the scope of the present invention is also included other administration regimens such as, e.g., more frequent and less frequent. In order to achieve a prolonged delivery of the PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof, a suitable vehicle including e.g. lipids or oils may be employed in order to form a depot at the administration site from which the receptor agonist is slowly released into the circulatory system, or an implant may be used. Suitable compositions in this respect include liposomes and biodegradable particles into which the receptor agonist has been incorporated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn those situations where solid compositions are required, the solid composition may be in the form of tablets such as, e.g. conventional tablets, effervescent tablets, coated tablets, melt tablets or sublingual tablets, pellets, powders, granules, granulates, particulate material, solid dispersions or solid solutions. A semi-solid form of the composition may be a chewing gum, an ointment, a cream, a liniment, a paste, a gel or a hydrogel. Other suitable dosages forms of the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be vagitories, suppositories, plasters, patches, tablets, capsules, sachets, troches, devices etc. The dosage form may be designed to release the compound freely or in a controlled manner e.g. with respect to tablets by suitable coatings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition may comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof according to the invention. The content of a PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof of the invention in a pharmaceutical composition of the invention is e.g. from about 0.1 to about 100% w/w of the pharmaceutical composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared by any of the method well known to a person skilled in pharmaceutical formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn pharmaceutical compositions, the PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof are normally combined with a pharmaceutical excipient, i.e. a therapeutically inert substance or carrier. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the desired dosage form and administration route. The pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be e.g. fillers, binders, disintegrants, diluents, glidants, solvents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, stabilizers, enhancers, flavours, colours, pH adjusting agents, retarding agents, wetting agents, surface active agents, preservatives, antioxidants etc. Details can be found in pharmaceutical handbooks such as, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Science or Pharmaceutical Excipient Handbook.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect compositions according to this invention will influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the present PYY analogue peptides. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1435-712, 18th ed, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (1990).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, administration of the pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may be via any common route so long as the target tissue is available via that route. In one aspect, the pharmaceutical compositions may be introduced into the subject by any conventional peripheral method, e.g., by intravenous, intradermal, intramusclar, intramammary, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, retrobulbar, intrapulmonary (e.g., term release); by oral, sublingual, nasal, anal, vaginal, or transdermal delivery, or by surgical implantation at a particular site. The treatment may consist of a single dose or a plurality of doses over a period of time. Controlled continual release of the compositions of the present invention is also contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulation may be liquid or may be solid, such as lyophilized, for reconstitution. Aqueous compositions of the present invention comprise an effective amount of the PYY or PP peptide derivative or analogue thereof, dissolved or dispersed in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or aqueous medium. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients also can be incorporated into the compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PYY or PP peptide derivative of analogue thereof of the invention may be prepared for administration as solutions of free base, or pharmacologically acceptable salts in water suitably mixed with surface active agents (e.g., sorbitan monooleate, polyoxyethylene sorbitain monolaurate (Tween 20), polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), lecithin, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers (Pluronics), hydroxypropylcellulose) or complexation agents (e.g., hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin, sulfobutyether-b-cyclodextrin (Captisol), polyvinylpyrrolidone). Pharmaceutically-acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the protein) and which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, mandelic, and the like. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups also can be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, histidine, procaine and the like. Such products are readily prepared by procedures well known to those skilled in the art. Dispersions also can be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are formulated so as to be suitable for parenteral administration, e.g., via injection or infusion. In one aspect, the PYY or PP peptide derivative of analogue thereof is suspended in an aqueous carrier, for example, in an buffer solution at a pH of about 3.0 to about 8.0, specifically at a pH of about 3.5 to about 7.4, about 3.5 to about 6.0, about 3.5 to about 5.0 or about 3.7 to about 4.7. Useful buffers include sodium acetate/acetic acid, sodium lactate/lactic acid, ascorbic acid, sodium citrate-citric acid, sodium bicarbonate/carbonic acid, sodium succinate/succinic acid, Histidine, Sodium benzoate/benzoic acid, and sodium phosphates, and Tris(hydroxymethyl)arninomehane. A form of repository or “depot” slow release preparation may be used so that therapeutically effective amounts of the preparation are delivered into the bloodstream over many hours or days following trans-dermal injection or delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form should be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that is easily syringable. It is also desirable for the PYY or PP peptide derivative of analogue thereof of the invention to be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., sorbitol, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), dimethylacetamide, cremorphor EL, suitable mixtures thereof, and oils (e.g., soybean, sesame, castor, cottonseed, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, glycofurol, corn). The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial an antifungal agents, for example, meta-cresol, benzyl alcohol, parabens (methyl, propyl, butyl), chlorobutanol, phenol, phenylmercuric salts (acetate, borate, nitrate), sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be beneficial to include tonicity agents (for example, sugars, sodium chloride). Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption (for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions may be prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle that contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques that yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. In general, the PYY or PP peptide derivative of analogue thereof may be formulated into a stable, safe pharmaceutical composition for administration to a patient. Pharmaceutical formulations contemplated for use in the methods of the invention may comprise approximately 0.01 to 20% (w/v), specifically 0.05 to 10%, of the PYY or PP peptide derivative of analogue thereof. The PYY or PP peptide derivative of analogue thereof may be in an acetate, phosphate, citrate or glutamate buffer allowing a pH of the final composition of about 3.0 to about 7.0 containing carbohydrate or polyhydric alcohol as tonicity modifier and, optionally, approximately 0.005 to 5.0% (w/v) of a preservative selected from the group consisting of m-cresol, benzyl alcohol, methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl parabens and phenol. Such a preservative is generally included if the formulated peptide is to be included in a multiple use product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the present invention, a pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention may contain a range of concentrations of PYY or PP peptide derivative of analogue thereof, e.g., between about 0.01% to about 98% w/w, or between about 1 to about 98% w/w, or specifically between 80% and 90% w/w, or specifically between about 0.01% to about 50% w/w, or more specifically between about 10% to about 25% w/w in this aspect. A sufficient amount of water for injection may be used to obtain the desired concentration of solution. The pharmaceutical formulations described herein may be lyophilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of the PYY or PP peptide derivative of analogue thereof will be determined by the age, weight, and condition or severity of the diseases or metabolic conditions or disorders of the recipient. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 697-773. See also Wang and Hanson, Parenteral Formulations of Proteins and Peptides: Stability and Stabilizers, Journal of Parenteral Science and Technology, Technical Report No. 10, Supp. 42:2 S (1988). Typically, a dosage of between about 0.001 μg/kg body weight/day to about 1000 μg/kg body weight/day, may be used, but more or less, as a skilled practitioner will recognize, may be used. Dosing may be one, two, three, four or more times daily, or less frequently, such as once a week, once a month, or once a quarter, depending on the formulation, and may be in conjunction with other compositions as described herein. It should be noted that the present invention is not limited to the dosages recited herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAppropriate dosages may be ascertained through the use of established assays for determining level of metabolic conditions or disorders in conjunction with relevant dose-response data. The final dosage regimen will be determined by the attending physician, considering factors that modify the action of drugs, e.g., the drug's specific activity, severity of the damage and the responsiveness of the patient, the age, condition, body weight, sex and diet of the patient, the severity of any infection, time of administration and other clinical factors. As studies are conducted, further information will emerge regarding appropriate dosage levels and duration of treatment for specific diseases and conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe frequency of dosing will depend on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the agents and the routes of administration. The optimal pharmaceutical formulation will be determined by one of skill in the art depending on the route of administration and the desired dosage. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra, pages 1435-1712. Such formulations may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release and rate of in vivo clearance of the administered agents. Depending on the route of administration, a suitable dose may be calculated according to body weight, body surface areas or organ size. Further refinement of the calculations necessary to determine the appropriate treatment dose is routinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation, especially in light of the dosage information and assays disclosed herein, as well as the pharmacokinetic data observed in animals or human clinical trials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that the pharmaceutical compositions and treatment methods of the invention may be useful in fields of human medicine and veterinary medicine. Thus the subject to be treated may be a mammal, specifically human or other animal. For veterinary purposes, subjects include for example, farm animals including cows, sheep, pigs, horses and goats, companion animals such as dogs and cats, exotic and/or zoo animals, laboratory animals including mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs and hamsters; and poultry such as chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present PYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof and compositions containing them are also useful in the manufacture of a medicament for the therapeutic applications mentioned herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention relates to the use of a derivative according to the invention for the preparation of a medicament.\n\n\n \nSyntheses\n\n\n \n \n \nPYY or PP peptide derivatives or analogues thereof of the invention may be synthesized by standard solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), using either an automated peptide synthesizer, or traditional bench synthesis. The solid support can be, for example, Tentagel S RAM, chlorotrityl (CI) or Wang (OH) resin, all of which are readily available commercially. The active amino or hydroxyl groups of those resins react readily with the carboxyl group of an N-Fmoc amino acid, thereby covalently binding it to the polymer via a linkage to a linker attached to the resin. The resin-bound Fmoc-amino acid may be deprotected by exposure to a mixture of 20% piperidine in N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) which readily cleaves the Fmoc-group. The subsequent amino acid is coupled using a coupling reagent and followed by another deprotection of the Fmoc-group. Examples of reagents facilitating the coupling of incoming amino acids to the resin-bound amino acid chain are: diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), tetra-methyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU), O-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)- N,N,N\\N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), O-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 1H-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe SPPS is continued a stepwise manner until the desired sequence is obtained. At the end of the synthesis, the resin-bound protected peptide is deprotected cleaving the protection groups on the side chains and also cleaving the peptide from the resin. This is done with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) containing scavengers such as triisopropylsilane (TIPS). The peptide is then precipitated in diethylether and isolated. Peptide synthesis by solution chemistry rather than solid phase chemistry is also feasible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may be desirable to purify the PP-fold peptides generated by the present invention. Peptide purification techniques are well known to those of skill in the art. These techniques involve, at one level, the crude fractionation of the cellular milieu to peptide and non-peptide fractions. Having separated the peptide from other proteins, the peptide of interest may be further purified using chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques to achieve partial or complete purification (or purification to homogeneity). Analytical methods particularly suited to the preparation of a pure peptide are ion-exchange chromatography, exclusion chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and isoelectric focusing. A particularly efficient method of purifying peptides is reverse phase HPLC, followed by characterization of purified product by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Additional confirmation of purity is obtained by determining amino acid analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect the present invention concern the purification, and in one aspect, the substantial purification, of a peptide derivative according to the invention. The term “purified peptide” as used herein, is intended to refer to a composition, isolatable from other components, wherein the peptide is purified to any degree relative to its naturally obtainable state. A purified peptide therefore also refers to a peptide, free from the environment in which it may naturally occur. Generally, “purified” will refer to a peptide composition that has been subjected to fractionation to remove various other components, and which composition substantially retains its expressed biological activity. Where the term “substantially purified” is used, this designation will refer to a composition in which the peptide forms the major component of the composition, such as constituting about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95% or more of the peptides in the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques suitable for use in peptide purification will be well known to those of skill in the art. These include, for example, precipitation with ammonium sulphate, PEG, antibodies, and the like; heat denaturation, followed by centrifugation; chromatography steps such as ion exchange, gel filtration, reverse phase, hydroxylapatite and affinity chromatography; isoelectric focusing; gel electrophoresis; and combinations of such and other techniques. As is generally known in the art, it is believed that the order of conducting the various purification steps may be changed, or that certain steps may be omitted, and still result in a suitable method for the preparation of a substantially purified protein or peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is no general requirement that the peptides always be provided in their most purified state. Indeed, it is contemplated that less substantially purified products will have utility in certain aspects. Partial purification may be accomplished by using fewer purification steps in combination, or by utilizing different fopins of the same general purification scheme. For example, it is appreciated that a cation-exchange column chromatography performed, utilizing an HPLC apparatus, will generally result in a greater “-fold” purification than the same technique utilizing a low pressure chromatography system. Methods exhibiting a lower degree of relative purification may have advantages in total recovery of protein product, or in maintaining the activity of an expressed protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne may optionally purify and isolate such PYY or PP peptides according to the invention from other components obtained in the process. Methods for purifying a peptide can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,849,883. These documents describe specific exemplary methods for the isolation and purification of G-CSF compositions that may be useful in isolating and purifying PYY or PP peptides according to the invention. Given the disclosure of these patents, it is evident that one of skill in the art would be well aware of numerous purification techniques that may be used to purify PYY or PP peptides according to the invention from a given source.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso it is contemplated that a combination of anion exchange and immunoaffinity chromatography may be employed to produce purified PP-fold peptide compositions of the present invention.\n\n\n \nEmbodiments of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n1.

R. Sampson (1999), J. Pep. Sci. 5, 403.\n\n\n \nSPPS Method II\n\n\n \n \n \nThe protected peptidyl resin was synthesized according to the Fmoc strategy on a Liberty from CEM corporation USA. Either 0.25 mmol or 0.5 mmol scale using the manufacturer supplied protocols which employ DIC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) and HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole) mediated couplings in NMP(N-methylpyrrolidone) was used. The starting resin used for the synthesis of the peptide amides was Tentagel RAM (Rapp Polymere, Germany), Rink amid ChemMatrix resin (Matrix Innovation, Canada) or Rink-Amide resin (Merck/Novabiochem) and either Wang or chlorotrityl resin was used for peptides with a carboxy C-terminal. The protected amino acid derivatives used were standard Fmoc-amino acids (supplied from e.g. Advanced Chemtech, or Novabiochem. The epsilon amino group of lysine in position 13 was protected with Mtt. The synthesis of the peptides may in some cases be improved by the use of dipeptides, e.g., pseudoprolines from Novabiochem, Fmoc-Ser(tbu)-ψSer(Me,Me)-OH, see, e.g., catalogue from Novobiochem 2002/2003 or newer version, or W. R. Sampson (1999), J. Pep. Sci. 5, 403.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProcedure for removal of Mtt-protection: The resin was placed in a syringe and treated with hexafluoroisopropanol for 2×10 min to remove the Mtt group. The resin was then washed with DCM and NMP as described above and neutralized with 5% DIPEA in NMP before coupling the albumin handles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProcedure for attachment of sidechains to Lysine residue: The albumin binding residue A-B-C-D-, A-C-D-, A-B-C-, or A-B- can be attached to the peptide either by stepwise acylation to resin bound peptide or acylation in solution to the unprotected peptide using standard acylation reagent such as but not limited to DIC, HOBt/DIC, HOAt/DIC, or HBTU.\n\n\n \nSolid Phase Method III\n\n\n \n \n \nThe protected peptidyl resin was synthesized on a Prelude (Protein technologies) according to the instructions from the manufacture. Typically 300 mg resin (Tentagel S Ram, Rapp Polymere) was used in the 10 ml reaction vessel or 1 gram of Tentage S RAM resin was used in the 40 ml reaction vessel according to manufactor. The step-wise assembly of the peptide was done using standard Fmoc/t-Bu strategy according to the manufacture of Prelude.\n\n\n \nManuel Synthesis of Peptidyl Resin\n\n\n \n \n \n1 g Tentagel S Ram 0.25 mmol/g (Rapp Polymere, Germany) was swelled in NMP for 30 min in a 50 ml syringe with polypropylene frit. Then the resin was deprotected with 20% piperidin in NMP for 20 min and washed with approx. with NMP. Then \namino acid\n 5 mmol Fmoc-Tyr(tbu)-OH was solubilised in 10 ml 0.5M HOAt in NMP and added to the resin. Then followed by addition of 5 mmol DIC and 1 mmol collidine and coupled for 30 min. Then excess amino acid was removed by washing with NMP and the Fmoc-group was removed by 20% piperidine in NMP for 15 min. Then the piperidin was removed by washing with NMP and the resin was ready for the next amino acid. The amino acids were added in a stepwise manner according to the previously described SPPS synthesis method to give the final peptide sequence. Finally, the N-alpha amino was protected with a Boc group. Optionally, for PYY(3-36) in position 13 the Ser was replaced by a Lys(Mtt) onto which the albumin handles were attached.\n\n\n \nSynthesis of Albumin Handles on Peptide\n\n\n \n \n \nThe protected peptidyl resin was swelled in neat hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) approx. 30 ml for 2 min followed by another addition of HFIP and let stand for 5 min. A third addition was performed and let stand for 20 min. Then the resin was washed with NMP and briefly with 20% piperidine in NMP and the again NMP to remove piperidine. Then Fmoc-Oeg (NeoMPS) was added 3 mmol in 6 ml 0.5M HOAt solution in NMP and 3 mmol DIC was added and let stand for 2 hours. Then washed and deprotected with 20% piperidine in NMP and washed followed by another addition of Fmoc-Oeg as mentioned above. Then after deprotection and washing 3 mmol Fmoc-L-Glu-tBu (IRIS-Biotech, Germany) in 6 ml 0.5 M HOAt solution in NMP was added followed by addition of 3 mmol DIC and let stand for approx. 19 hours. The after removing the Fmoc-\ngroup\n 3 mmol of the residue Fmoc-tranexamic acid (NeoMPS) in 6 ml 0.5M HOAt solution was added followed by 3 mmol DIC and let stand for >2 hours. After coupling the resin was washed and Fmoc was removed by 20% piperidine in NMP and after \nNMP washing\n 3 mmol mono-tertbutyl-dodecanedioic acid in 6 ml 0.5 M HOAt solution was added followed by 3 mmol DIC and let stand for >16 hours. The resin was washed with NMP and diethylether and dried.\n\n\n \nFinal Deprotection and Isolation\n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptide and side chain protection groups were removed by addition of 30 ml 92% TFA, 5% TIPS and 3% ethanol for approx. 2 hours. Then TFA was collected and concentrated by a stream of argon and diethylether was added to precipitate the peptide. The peptide was washed five times with ether and dried.\n\n\n \nHPLC Analysis\n\n\nHPLC Analysis Method I:\n\n\n \n \n \nBuffer A: 0.1% TFA in water\n\n\n \nBuffer B: 0.1% in AcCN\n\n\n \n \n \nGradient: 0% buffer B to 90% buffer B in 50 min.\n\n\nFlow: 0.5 ml/min\n\n\n\n \nColumn: Jubitor Proteo C12, 4.6×250 mm,\n\n\n \n \n \nColumn temperature: 42° C.\n\n\n \nHPLC Analysis Method II\n\n\n \n \n \nBuffer A: 0.5M ammoniumbicarbonate in 90% water/10% AcCN\n\n\nBuffer B: 70% AcCN/30% water\n\n\nGradient 25% buffer B to 55% in 16 min.\n\n\nFlow: 0.4 ml/min\n\n\n\n \nColumn: Acquity UPLC HSS T3, 1.8 um, 2.1×150 mm\n\n\n \n \n \nColumn temperature: 30° C.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nManuel Synthesis of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 13\n\n\n \n \n \nThe syntheses were carried out using the above mentioned methods “Synthesis of peptidyl resin”, “Synthesis of albumin handles on peptide” and “Final deprotection and isolation”.\n\n\n \nAnalytical Data\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 1\n\n\n \n \n \nRetention time HPLC method I: 25.9 min\n\n\nRetention time HPLC method II: 5.6 min\n\n\nMw calculated: 4049.6 g/mol\n\n\nMALDI MS: 4046.4 g/mol\n\n\n\n \nSEQ ID NO: 3\n\n\n \n \n \nRetention time HPLC method I: 33.1 min\n\n\nRetention time HPLC method II: 11.5 min\n\n\nMw calculated: 4973.8 g/mol\n\n\nMALDI MS: 4972.3 g/mol\n\n\n\n \nSEQ ID NO: 13\n\n\n \n \n \nRetention time HPLC method I: 34.0 min\n\n\nRetention time HPLC method II: 10.2 min\n\n\nMw calculated: 4932.7 g/mol\n\n\nMALDI MS: 4931.7 g/mol\n\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nAutomated Synthesis of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8 and SEQ ID NO: 9\n\n\n \n \n \nThe syntheses were carried out as described in SPPS Method II using 0.5 g Tentagel HL RAM resin (Rapp Polymere, Germany) on a Liberty peptide synthesizer.

Mice were administrated a single dose of the peptides (1 μmol/kg s.c.) 30 min before food return and cumulative food intake was measured over 24 h. The results are shown in Table 4, \nFIGS. 1A and 1B\n. As seen in Table 4, \nFIGS. 1A and 1B\n the effect of protracted PYY(3-36) and PP analogues in reducing food-intake is prolonged compared to the effect of unmodified human PYY(3-36). Specifically, the effect of SEQ ID NO: 3 and SEQ ID NO: 4 (protracted PYY(3-36) and PP analogues, respectively) in reducing food-intake is prolonged compared to the effect of unmodified human PYY(3-36) (SEQ ID NO: 1). Whereas the effect of unmodified human PYY(3-36) in reducing food intake has disappeared 6 hours after administration the effect of the protracted PYY(3-36) and PP analogues persists 24 hours after administration of the peptides. Furthermore, an apparent delay in the onset of effect is observed for the protracted PYY(3-36) and PP analogues compared to unmodified human PYY(3-36) which may be consistent with a different pharmacokinetic profile for the protracted peptides. One way ANOVA was carried for each time point out using the software Graph-Pad Prism, version 5.0.

Five Göttingen mini-pigs were administrated a single i.v. bolus dose of SEQ ID NO: 3; blood samples were taken at the indicated time points and the plasma concentration of SEQ ID NO: 3 was determined by LC/MS as described herein. The mean terminal plasma half-life (t1/2) of SEQ ID NO: 3 was calculated to be 12±4 hours by non-compartmental analysis of the plasma concentration-time profiles as described herein. The results are shown in \nFIG. 8\n. Thus, the half-life of SEQ ID NO: 3 is considerably prolonged compared to the reported half-life of <30 minutes for unmodified PYY(3-36) in pigs (Ito T et al, Journal of Endocrinology (2006), 191, pp 113-119).\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\n \n \n \nAn assay useful for measuring PK of the compounds of the invention is the minipig PK assay. Male Göttingen mini-pigs (n≧3) weighing approximately 15 to 35 kg from Ellegaard Göttingen Minipigs A/S, Denmark were included in the study. The mini-pigs had two central venous catheters inserted which were used for intra venous (i.v.) dosing and bloodsampling. The compound was dissolved in 50 mM K\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.05\n% tween\n 80, pH=8.0 to an appropriate concentration (e.g. 25-500 nmol/mL). The pigs were dosed intravenously (i.v.) or subcutaneously (s.c.) with between 1 and 30 nmol compound/kg body weight. Blood samples were taken at the following at appropriate time points, such as pre-dose, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, 240 and 288 hours post dosing. The blood samples were collected into test tubes containing EDTA buffer (with Aprotinin 15000 KIE/mL and Val-Pyr 0.30 mM) for stabilization and kept on ice for max. 20 minutes before centrifugation. The centrifugation procedure to separate plasma was; 4° C., 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. Plasma were collected and immediately transferred to Micronic tubes stored at −20° C. until assayed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn additional mini-pig PK assay was used for measuring PK of the compounds of the invention. Mini-pigs weighing 15 to 35 kg from Ellegaard Göttingen Minipigs A/S were included in the studies. The animals had two central venous catheters inserted which were used for intra venous (i.v.) dosing and blood sampling. Compounds were dissolved in 10 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 150 mM NaCl, 0.01\n% tween\n 80, pH=4.0 to concentrations in the range of 40 nmol/ml to 200 nmol/ml. The mini-pigs were dosed i.v. with 10 nmol compound/kg body weight, occasionally other doses such as 4 nmol/kg, 30 nmol/kg or 50 nmol/kg were administered. Each compound was dosed to 3 or 4 mini-pigs, and two compounds may be given simultaneously to the same animal. Blood were sampled pre-dose and 12 times during the first 10 hours post-dose. Blood were furthermore sampled once daily up till 13 days post dosing. The blood samples were collected into test tubes containing EDTA buffer, trasylol and Val-Pyr for stabilization and kept on ice for max. 20 minutes. Samples were centrifuged at 4° C., 2000G for 10 minutes to separate plasma.

Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to aziridinyl-epothilone analogs pharmaceutical compositions comprising aziridinyl-epothilone analogs, and methods of using the same.\n\n\n2. Related Background Art\n\n\nEpothilones A and B are naturally-occurring compounds that were discovered by Höfle et al. as isolated from fermentation products of the microorganism, Sorangium cellulosum (see, e.g., WO 93/10121). Höfle et al. also discovered 37 natural epothilone variants and related compounds produced by Sorangium cellulosum, including epothilones C, D, E, F and other isomers and variants. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,624,310. While in 1993 Höfle et al reported on cytotoxic effects of Epothilones A and B, in 1995 researchers with Merck reported that epothilone B exerts microtubule-stabilizing effects similar to paclitaxel (TAXOL®) (See D. M. Bollag, “Epothilones, a New Class of Microtubule-Stabilizing Agents with a Taxol-like Mechanism of Action,” Cancer Research, Vol. 55 (June 1995), at pp. 2325-2333).\n\n\nVarious derivatives and analogs of the naturally-occurring epothilones have been discovered at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Examples of epothilone analogs include the azaepothilone B analog known as ixabepilone, 21-substituted analogs of epothilone B including a 21-amino analog, 2,3-olefinic analogs, C-3 cyano analogs, cyclopropyl analogs, and heterocyclic analogs including aziridinyl-epothilone analogs. See, e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,605,599; 6,262,094; 6,399,638; 6,498,257; 6,380,395; and 6,800,653, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Others have also reported on the discovery of other epothilone derivatives and analogs. See, e.g., PCT Pub. Nos. WO 99/65913, WO 98/25929; WO 00/99/07692; WO 99/67252; WO 00/00485; WO 00/37473; WO 01/83800; WO 99/67253, WO 99/07692, WO 00/00485, WO 00/49021, WO 00/66589, WO 03/045324, WO 04/014919, WO 04/056832, WO 03/022844; U.S. Pat.

Often, however, anticancer drugs attack not only tumor cells but also normal tissue, leading to undesired side effects. Additionally, anticancer drugs typically present solubility issues such that formulation and delivery of the agents can present challenges, leading to use of solubilizing agents such as CREMOPHOR®. The cytotoxicity of some anticancer drugs and/or formulation ingredients has been known to cause neuropathy or other side effects such as hypersensitivity reactions. These adverse side effects highlight the need for anticancer therapies that are selective for pathogenic cell populations and therefore result in reduced host toxicity.\n\n\nHowever, as discussed in WO 2004/054622 A1 scientists have for many years attempted to use monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in targeted drug therapies for delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to patients, but drawbacks have been encountered in terms of, inter alia, the cleavable moiety, the linkers, and the form of drug released in the cell. It has been reported that successful therapy of tumors with mAbs is limited by inadequate penetration of the antibody in the tumor and by the heterogeneous distribution of corresponding tumor-associated antigen in the tumor tissue. See, Klar et al., WO 05/074901 (assigned to Schering AG).\n\n\nUS Pat. App. Pub. No. 2005/0002942 discloses vitamin receptor binding drug delivery conjugates that are useful for targeted drug delivery. There is a need in the art for identifying anticancer agents that could be used to make conjugates such as those described in US 2005/0002942, in the interest of providing targeted drug delivery for cancer treatment.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is directed to compounds having the following Formula X:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor pharmaceutically-acceptable salts and/or solvates thereof, wherein:\n\n\nK is —O—, —S—, or —NR\n7\n—;\n\n\nA is —(CR\n8\nR\n9\n)—(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-Z- wherein Z is —(CHR\n10\n)—, —C(═O)—, —C(═O)—C(═O)—, —OC(═O)—, —N(R\n11\n)C(═O)—, —SO\n2\n—, or —N(R\n11\n)SO\n2\n—;\n\n\nB\n1 \nis hydroxyl or cyano and R\n1 \nis hydrogen or B\n1 \nand R\n1 \nare taken together to form a double bond;\n\n\nR\n2\n, R\n3\n, and R\n5 \nare, independently, hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl; or R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nmay be taken together with the carbon to which they are attached to form an optionally substituted cycloalkyl;\n\n\nR\n4 \nis hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkyl, substituted alkenyl, aryl, or substituted aryl;\n\n\nR\n6 \nis hydrogen, alkyl or substituted alkyl;\n\n\nR\n7\n, R\n8\n, R\n9\n, R\n10\n, and R\n11 \nare independently hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, heterocycloalkyl, substituted heterocycloalkyl, heteroaryl, or substituted heteroaryl;\n\n\nR\n12 \nis H, alkyl, substituted alkyl, or halogen;\n\n\nR\n13 \nis aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl or substituted heteroaryl; and\n\n\nm is 0 to 6.\n\n\nThe present invention is further directed to methods for treating cancer with use of compounds having the Formula X, as well as use of the compounds of Formula X in preparing pharmaceutical compositions with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for treating cancer.

The initial definition provided for a group or term herein applies to that group or term throughout the present specification individually or as part of another group, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\nThe term “folate-binding moiety or analog or derivative thereof” as used herein means a moiety that will bind to a folate-receptor protein (not a monoclonal antibody) that is overexpressed or preferentially expressed on cancer cells. For example, it is known that the folate receptor (FR) is overexpressed in ovarian cancer cells and other cancer cells. Illustrative analogs and derivatives of folate are disclosed in US Pat. App. Pub. No. 2005/0002942 to Vlahov et al., (hereinafter “Vlahov”), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe term “releasable linker” as used herein means a bivalent linker that includes at least one cleavable bond that can be broken under physiological conditions (e.g. a pH-labile, reductively-labile, acid-labile, oxidatively-labile, or enzyme-labile bond.) It should be appreciated that such physiological conditions resulting in bond breaking include standard chemical hydrolysis reactions that occur, for example, at physiological pH, or as a result of compartmentalization into a cellular organelle, such as an endosome having a lower pH than cytosolic pH, or as a result of reaction with a cellular reducing agent such as glutathione.\n\n\nIt is understood that a cleavable bond can connect two adjacent atoms within the releasable linker and/or connect other groups to the releasable linker such as Q and K, as described herein, at either or both ends of the linker.\n\n\nThe terms “alkyl” and “alk” whether alone or in combination with some other group, refer to a straight or branched chain alkane (hydrocarbon) radical attached at any available carbon atom, containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Exemplary such groups include, but are not limited to methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, 4,4-dimethylpentyl, octyl, 2,2,4-trimethylpentyl, and the like. “Lower alkyl” or “lower alkylene” means a straight or branched chain alkyl having one to four carbon atoms. When a subscript is used with reference to an alkyl or other group, the subscript refers to the number of carbon atoms that the group may contain. For example, the term “C\n0-4\nalkyl” includes a bond and alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and the term “C\n1-4\nalkyl” means alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms.\n\n\nThe term “alkylene” refers to a bivalent hydrocarbon radical, as described above for “alkyl” but with two points of attachment. For example, a methylene group is a —CH\n2\n— group and an ethylene group is a —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— group.\n\n\nWhen the term alkyl is used in connection with another group, as in heterocycloalkyl or cycloalkylalkyl, this means the other identified (first named) group is bonded directly through an alkyl group as defined above (e.g., which may be branched or straight chain). Thus, the term “alkyl” is used in this instance to refer to an alkylene, e.g., a divalent alkyl group, having two available points of attachment. For example, cyclopropyl C\n1-4\nalkyl means a cyclopropyl group bonded through a straight or branched chain alkylene having one to four carbon atoms, and hydroxyalkyl means the group OH bonded through a straight or branched chain alkylene having one to ten carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms. In the case of substituents, as in “substituted cycloalkylalkyl,” the alkylene portion of the group, besides being branched or straight chain, may be substituted as recited below for substituted alkyl groups and/or the first named group (e.g., cycloalkyl) may be substituted as recited herein for that named group (e.g., cycloalkyl).\n\n\n“Substituted alkyl” refers to an alkyl group substituted with one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents, at any available point of attachment. However, when an alkyl group is substituted with multiple halo substituents, the alkyl may contain as valence allows up to 10 substituents, more preferably up to seven substituents. Alkyl substituents may include one or more of the following groups: halo (e.g., a single halo substituent or multiple halo substituents forming, in the latter case, groups such as a perfluoroalkyl group or an alkyl group bearing Cl\n3 \nor CF\n3\n), cyano, —R\na\n, —SR\na\n, —C(═O)R\na\n, —C(═O)OR\na\n, —OC(═O)R\na\n, —OC(═O)OR\na\n, —NR\na\nR\nb\n, —C(═O)NR\na\nR\nb\n, —OC(═O)NR\na\nR\nb\n, —S(═O)R\na\n, —S(O)\n2\nR\na\n, —NHS(O)\n2\nR\na\n, —NHS(O)\n2\nNHR\na\n, —NHC(═O)NHR\na\n, —NHC(═O)R\na\n, —NHC(O)\n2\nR\na\n, —NHC(═N—CN)R\na\n, aryl, heterocycle, cycloalkyl, and/or heteroaryl, wherein the groups R\na \nand R\nb \nare independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclo, aryl, and heteroaryl, and wherein each R\na \nand/or R\nb \nin turn is optionally substituted with one to four groups selected from alkyl, alkenyl, halogen, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, cyano, nitro, amino, alkylamino, aminoalkyl, hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, alkoxy, thiol, alkylthio, phenyl, benzyl, phenyloxy, benzyloxy, C\n3-7\ncycloalkyl, five or six membered heterocyclo or heteroaryl, and/or a lower alkyl or lower alkenyl substituted with one to four groups selected from hydroxy, cyano, halogen, haloC\n1-4\nalkyl, haloC\n1-4\nalkoxy, cyano, nitro, amino, C\n1-4\nalkylamino, aminoC\n1-4\nalkyl, hydroxyC\n1-4\nalkyl, C\n1-4\nalkoxy, thiol, and/or C\n1-4 \nalkylthio. For the avoidance of doubt, a “substituted lower alkyl” means an alkyl group having one to four carbon atoms and one to four substituents selected from those recited immediately above for substituted alkyl groups. In the case of a substituted lower alkyl, preferably the groups R\na \nand R\nb \nare selected from hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, C\n3-7\ncycloalkyl, phenyl, and five to six membered monocyclic heterocyclo and/or heteroaryl, in turn optionally substituted as above.\n\n\nThe term “alkenyl” refers to a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radical containing from 2 to 12 carbon atoms and at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Exemplary such groups include ethenyl or allyl. “Substituted alkenyl” refers to an alkenyl group substituted with one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents, at any available point of attachment. Exemplary substituents include alkyl, substituted alkyl, and those groups recited above as alkyl substituents.\n\n\nThe terms “alkoxy” and “alkylthio” refer to an alkyl group as described above bonded through an oxygen linkage (—O—) or a sulfur linkage (—S—), respectively. The terms “substituted alkoxy” and “substituted alkylthio” refer to a substituted alkyl group as described above bonded through an oxygen or sulfur linkage, respectively. A “lower alkoxy” or a C\n1-4\nalkoxy is a group OR, wherein R is lower alkyl (alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms).\n\n\n“Amino” is NH\n2\n. An alkylamino is —NR\nc\nR\nd \nwherein at least one of R\nc \nand R\nd \nis an alkyl or substituted alkyl, and the other of R\nc \nand R\nd \nis selected from hydrogen, alkyl, and substituted alkyl. An “aminoalkyl” means an amino group bonded through an alkylene group (-alkylene-NH\n2\n), and an alkylaminoalkyl means an alkylamino as defined above bonded through an alkylene group (-alkylene-NR\nc\nR\nd\n).\n\n\nThe term “aryl” refers to cyclic, aromatic hydrocarbon groups which have 1 to 3 aromatic rings, especially monocyclic or bicyclic groups such as phenyl or naphthyl. Aryl groups which are bicyclic or tricyclic must include at least one fully aromatic carbocyclic ring but the other fused ring or rings may be aromatic or non-aromatic and may optionally contain heteroatoms, provided that in such cases the point of attachment will be to the aromatic carbocyclic ring. Additionally, when an aryl group has fused thereto a heterocyclic or cycloalkyl ring, the heterocyclic and/or cycloalkyl ring may have one or more carbonyl carbon atoms, i.e., attached via a double bond to an oxygen atom to define a carbonyl group. Thus, examples of “aryl” may include without limitation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term “arylene” refers to a bivalent aryl radical, i.e., an aryl group as defined above having two points of attachment to two other groups, at any available points of attachment of the aryl ring. Arylene rings may also be substituted with any of the groups suitable for substitution on the aryl groups defined herein.\n\n\n“Substituted aryl” refers to an aryl or arylene group as defined above substituted by one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents, at any point of attachment. Substituents include alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, as well as those groups recited above as alkyl substituents.\n\n\nThe term “carbocyclic” means a saturated or unsaturated monocyclic, bicyclic, or tricyclic ring (preferably mono- or bicyclic) in which all atoms of all rings are carbon. Thus, the term includes cycloalkyl and aryl rings. The carbocyclic ring may be substituted in which case the substituents are selected from those recited above for cycloalkyl and aryl groups.\n\n\nThe term “cycloalkyl” refers to a fully saturated or partially saturated cyclic hydrocarbon group containing from 1 to 3 rings and 3 to 7 carbon atoms per ring. Exemplary fully saturated cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. Exemplary partially saturated cycloalkyl groups include cyclobutenyl, cyclopentenyl, and cyclohexenyl. The term “cycloalkyl” includes such groups having a bridge of three to four carbon atoms. Additionally, cycloalkyl groups which are bicyclic or tricyclic must include at least one fully saturated or partially saturated hydrocarbon ring but the other fused ring or rings may be aromatic or non-aromatic and may contain heteroatoms, provided that in such cases the point of attachment will be to the cyclic, non-aromatic hydrocarbon group. Additionally, one or more carbon atoms of the cycloalkyl group may form a carbon-to-oxygen double bond to define a carbonyl group. Thus, examples of “cycloalkyl” groups may include, without limitation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term “cycloalkylene” refers to a bivalent cycloalkyl radical, i.e., a cycloalkyl group as defined above having two points of attachment to two other groups, at any available two points of attachment of the cycloalkyl ring.\n\n\n“Substituted cycloalkyl” refers to a cycloalkyl group as defined above substituted at any available point of attachment with one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents. Cycloalkyl substituents include alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, and those groups recited above as alkyl substituents.\n\n\nThe term “guanidinyl” means the group\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThus, a guanidinylalkyl means an alkyl group bonded to the guanidinyl such as a group having the formula,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term “halogen” or “halo” refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.\n\n\nThe term “heteroatoms” includes oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen.\n\n\nThe term “haloalkyl” means an alkyl having one or more halo substituents, including without limitation groups such as —CH\n2\nF, —CHF\n2 \nand —CF\n3\n.\n\n\nThe term “haloalkoxy” means an alkoxy group having one or more halo substituents. For example, “haloalkoxy” includes —OCF\n3\n.\n\n\nWhen the term “unsaturated” is used herein to refer to a ring or group, the ring or group may be fully unsaturated or partially unsaturated.\n\n\nThe term “heteroaryl” refers to an aromatic group which is a 4 to 7 membered monocyclic, 7 to 11 membered bicyclic, or 10 to 15 membered tricyclic ring system, which has at least one ring containing at least one heteroatom. Each ring of the heteroaryl group containing a heteroatom can contain one or two oxygen or sulfur atoms and/or from one to four nitrogen atoms, provided that the total number of heteroatoms in each ring is four or less and each ring has at least one carbon atom. The fused rings completing the bicyclic and tricyclic groups may contain only carbon atoms and may be saturated, partially saturated, or unsaturated. The nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen atoms may optionally be quaternized. Heteroaryl groups which are bicyclic or tricyclic must include at least one fully aromatic ring but the other fused ring or rings may be aromatic or non-aromatic and may be carbocyclic, provided that in such cases the point of attachment will be at any available nitrogen or carbon atom of an aromatic heteroatom-containing ring. Additionally, the definition of heteroaryl groups itself includes rings wherein one or more of the carbon atoms is attached via a double bond to an oxygen atom to define a carbonyl group (provided the heteroaryl group is aromatic) and also when a heteroaryl group has fused thereto a heterocyclic or cycloalkyl ring, the heterocyclic and/or cycloalkyl ring may have one or more carbonyl groups.\n\n\nExemplary monocyclic heteroaryl groups include pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, pyrazolinyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl (i.e.,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nthiadiazolyl, isothiazolyl, furanyl, thienyl, oxadiazolyl, pyridyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, triazinyl and the like. Additionally, since the definition of heteroaryl groups itself includes rings wherein one or more of the carbon atoms defines a carbonyl group, rings such as 2,4-dihydro-[1,2,4]triazol-3-one (i.e.,\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nand the like are included.\n\n\n\nExemplary bicyclic heteroaryl groups include indolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzodioxolyl, benzoxaxolyl, benzothienyl, quinolinyl, tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, benzimidazolyl, benzopyranyl, indolizinyl, benzopyranyl, chromonyl, coumarinyl, benzopyranyl, cinnolinyl, quinoxalinyl, indazolyl, pyrrolopyridyl, furopyridinyl, dihydroisoindolyl, tetrahydroquinolinyl and the like.\n\n\nExemplary tricyclic heteroaryl groups include carbazolyl, benzidolyl, phenanthrollinyl, acridinyl, phenanthridinyl, xanthenyl and the like.\n\n\nThe term “heteroalkylene” refers to a bivalent heteroaryl radical, i.e., a heteroaryl group as defined above having two points of attachment to two other groups, at any available two points of attachment of the heteroaryl ring.\n\n\n“Substituted heteroaryl” groups are heteroaryl groups as defined above substituted with one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents, at any available point of attachment. Exemplary substituents include, but are not limited to alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, as well as those groups recited above as alkyl substituents.\n\n\nThe terms “heterocycle”, “heterocyclic” and “heterocyclo” are used interchangeably and each refer to a fully saturated or partially unsaturated nonaromatic cyclic group, which may be substituted or unsubstituted, for example, which is a 4 to 7 membered monocyclic, 7 to 11 membered bicyclic, or 10 to 15 membered tricyclic ring system, which has at least one heteroatom in at least one carbon atom-containing ring. Each ring of the heterocyclic group containing a heteroatom may have 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms, where the nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms also optionally may be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatoms also optionally may be quatemized. Preferably two adjacent heteroatoms are not simultaneously selected from oxygen and nitrogen. Heterocyclic groups which are bicyclic or tricyclic must include at least one non-aromatic non-carbocyclic ring, but the other fused ring or rings may be aromatic or non-aromatic and may be carbocyclic, provided that in such cases the point of attachment will be at any available nitrogen or carbon atom of a non-aromatic heteroatom-containing ring. Additionally, the definition of heterocyclic groups itself includes rings wherein one or more of the carbon atoms is attached via a double bond to an oxygen atom to define a carbonyl group (provided the heterocyclic group is non-aromatic) and also when a heterocyclic group has fused thereto a further ring, such further ring may have one or more carbonyl groups.\n\n\nExemplary monocyclic heterocyclic groups include pyrrolidinyl, imidazolidinyl, tetrahydrofuryl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, pyrazolidinyl, imidazolinyl, pyrrolinyl, tetrahydropyranyl, morpholinyl, thiamorpholinyl, and the like.\n\n\n“Substituted heterocycle,” “substituted heterocyclic,” and “substituted heterocyclo” refer to heterocycle, heterocyclic, or heterocyclo groups as defined above substituted with one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents, at any available point of attachment. Exemplary substituents include alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, as well as those groups recited above as exemplary alkyl substituents.\n\n\n“Hydroxy” refers to —OH.\n\n\n“Thiol” means the group —SH.\n\n\nThe term “quaternary nitrogen” refers to a tetravalent positively charged nitrogen atom including, for example, the positively charged nitrogen in a tetraalkylammonium group (e.g., tetramethylammonium or N-methylpyridinium), the positively charged nitrogen in protonated ammonium species (e.g., trimethylhydroammonium or N-hydropyridinium), the positively charged nitrogen in amine N-oxides (e.g., N-methyl-morpholine-N-oxide or pyridine-N-oxide), and the positively charged nitrogen in an N-amino-ammonium group (e.g., N-aminopyridinium).\n\n\nWhen a functional group is termed “protected”, this means that the group is in modified form to mitigate, especially preclude, undesired side reactions at the protected site. Suitable protecting groups for the methods and compounds described herein include, without limitation, those described in standard textbooks, including Greene, T.

In this embodiment, a conjugated compound is delivered to the tumor site, and then the compound of formulae X, Xa, Xa′, Xb, or Xb′, as defined above, is released at the tumor site and treats the patient at the tumor site. It is therefore understood herein, whenever the term “treatment” is used with reference to treating a patient, that this encompasses treatment at the tumor site, however delivered, e.g., via a conjugated compound.\n\n\nThe use of an agent to upregulate the level of folate receptor (FR) may be effective to increase the FR expression in certain cancer cells or tumor types to enhance the advantages obtained upon administering the compounds of the invention to patients, and/or to enhance the various diseases or tumor types that may be treated with the folate receptor binding compounds according to the invention. The expression of folate receptor in certain cancers may be upregulated by the administration of a folate receptor inducer, which selectively increases the level of folate receptor in the cancer cells, thus enhancing the effectiveness a folate receptor targeted therapy. For example, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers express low levels of folate receptors. Treatment with a folate receptor inducer, such tamoxifen, an estrogen antagonist, is known to upregulate the expression of folate receptors in ER+ breast cancers, increasing the ER+ breast cancer cells susceptibility to treatment with a folate receptor targeted therapy.\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention provides a method of treating cancer or a proliferative disease in a patient, comprising optionally administering to a patient an effective amount of at least one folate receptor inducer, and treating the patient with an effective amount of at least one compound according to formula X. The folate receptor inducer may be administered before, during, or after the patient is treated with the compound according to formula X. In one embodiment, the folate receptor inducer is administered prior to treatment with the compound of formula X. An effective amount of the folate receptor inducer refers to an amount that upregulates the folate receptor in the desired cells such that the treatment with the compound is therapeutically effective.\n\n\nExamples of folate receptor inducers for the upregulation of folate receptor α (FRα) include: estrogen receptor antagonists such as tamoxifen; progesterone receptor agonists such as progestin; androgen receptor agonists such as testosterone and dihydroxytestosterone, and glucocorticoid receptor agonists such as dexamethasone.\n\n\nExamples of folate receptor inducers for the upregulation of folate receptor β (FRβ) include: retinoic acid receptor agonists such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), tetramethyl napthalenyl propenyl benzoic acid (TTNPB), 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cis RA), CD33336, LG101093, and CD2781.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a method of treating cancer or a proliferative disease in a patient in need thereof is provided, comprising administering an effective amount of at least one folate receptor inducer and also treating the patient with at least one compound according to formula X; wherein said folate receptor inducer upregulates folate receptor α. Preferably, said cancer or proliferative disease is selected from breast cancer, such as ER+ breast cancer, and ovarian cancer.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, a method of treating cancer or a proliferative disease in a patient in need thereof is provided, comprising administering an effective amount of at least one folate receptor inducer and administering an effective amount of at least one compound according to formula X; wherein said folate receptor inducer upregulates folate receptor β. Preferably, said cancer or proliferative disease is selected from leukemia, and more preferably from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, a method of treating cancer or a proliferative disease in a patient in need thereof is provided, comprising administering an effective amount of at least one folate receptor inducer, administering at least one histone deacetylase inhibitor, and treating the patient with an effective amount of at least one compound according to formula X. An example of a histone deacetylase inhibitor is trichostatin A (TSA). U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0170299 A1, WO 2004/082463, Kelly, K. M., B. G. Rowan, and M. Ratnam, Cancer Research 63, 2820-2828 (2003), Wang, Zheng, Behm, and Ratnam, Blood, 96:3529-3536 (2000).\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may form salts or solvates which are also within the scope of this invention. Reference to a compound of the formula (X) herein is understood to include reference to salts and solvates thereof, racemates, diastereomers, and enantiomers thereof, unless otherwise indicated. The term “salt(s)”, as employed herein, denotes acidic and/or basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids and bases. In addition, when a compound of formula (X) contains both a basic moiety, such as but not limited to a pyridinyl imidazolyl, amine or guanidinyl and an acidic moiety such as but not limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions may be formed and are included within the term “salt(s)” as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful, e.g., in isolation or purification steps which may be employed during preparation. Salts of the compounds of the formula (X) may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of formula (X) with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (X) that contain a basic moiety, such as but not limited to an amine, a guanidinyl group, or a pyridyl or imidazolyl ring, may form salts with a variety of organic and inorganic acids. Exemplary acid addition salts include acetates (such as those formed with acetic acid or trihaloacetic acid, for example, trifluoroacetic acid), adipates, alginates, ascorbates, aspartates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates, cyclopentanepropionates, digluconates, dodecylsulfates, ethanesulfonates, fumarates, glucoheptanoates, glycerophosphates, hemisulfates, heptanoates, hexanoates, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, hydroiodides, hydroxyethanesulfonates (e.g., 2-hydroxyethanesulfonates), lactates, maleates, methanesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates (e.g., 2-naphthalenesulfonates), nicotinates, nitrates, oxalates, pectinates, persulfates, phenylpropionates (e.g., 3-phenylpropionates), phosphates, picrates, pivalates, propionates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates (such as those formed with sulfuric acid), sulfonates (such as those mentioned herein), tartrates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates such as tosylates, undecanoates, and the like.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (X) that contain an acidic moiety, such as but not limited to a carboxylic acid, may form salts with a variety of organic and inorganic bases. Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts; alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithiium, and potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts; salts with organic bases (for example, organic amines) such as benzathines, dicyclohexylamines, hydrabamines (formed with N,N-bis(dehydroabietyl)ethylenediamine), N-methyl-D-glucamines, N-methyl-D-glycamides, t-butyl amines; and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g. dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g. decyl, lauryl, myristyl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g. benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others.\n\n\nSolvates of the compounds of the invention are also contemplated herein. Solvates of the compounds of formula (X) include, for example, hydrates.\n\n\nAll stereoisomers of the present compounds (for example, those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on various substituents), including enantiomeric forms and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention. Thus, for example, each reference to compounds of Formula X, is intended to encompass compounds of Formula X′. Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may, for example, be substantially free of other isomers (e.g., as a pure or substantially pure optical isomer having a specified activity), or may be admixed, for example, as racemates or with all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention may have the S or R configuration as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations. Racemic forms can be resolved by physical methods, such as, for example, fractional crystallization, separation or crystallization of diastereomeric derivatives, or separation by chiral column chromatography. Individual optical isomers can be obtained from stereospecific processes, wherein starting materials and/or intermediates are selected having a stereochemistry corresponding with that desired for the end products, and the stereochemistry is maintained throughout the reactions, and/or the isomers can be obtained from racemates by any suitable method, including without limitation, conventional methods, such as, for example, salt formation with an optically active acid followed by crystallization.\n\n\nAll configurational isomers of the compounds of the present invention are contemplated, either in admixture, or in pure or substantially pure form. As can be appreciated, the preferred configuration can be a function of the particular compound and the activity desired. Configurational isomers may be prepared by the processes described herein, which may be stereoselective. In other words, a desired stereochemistry for the final compounds can be achieved by using starting materials having the corresponding desired stereochemistry, and then maintaining the stereoselectivity throughout the process of preparation. Alternatively, the compounds may be prepared as racemates or diastereomers, and then the desired stereochemistry may be achieved via separation of configurational isomers which can be achieved by any suitable method known in the field, e.g., such as column chromatography.\n\n\nThroughout the specification, groups and substituents thereof may be chosen to provide stable moieties and compounds useful as pharmaceutically-acceptable compounds and/or intermediate compounds useful in making pharmaceutically-acceptable compounds. One skilled in the field will appreciate suitable selections for variables to achieve stable compounds.\n\n\nEmbodiments indicated herein as exemplary or preferred are intended to be illustrative and not limiting.\n\n\nOther embodiments of the invention will be apparent to one skilled in the field such as, for example, considering combinations of the embodiments referenced above, and are contemplated as covered within the scope of the invention herein.\n\n\nUtility\n\n\nOne of the proteins that is over-expressed or preferentially expressed in certain cancer cells is the folate receptor. Folic acid is required for DNA synthesis, and certain human tumor cells are known to over-express folate-binding proteins. For example, both Campbell et al., “Folate Binding Protein is a Marker for Ovarian Cancer,” Cancer Research, Vol. 51 (Oct. 1, 1991), at pp. 5329-38, and Coney et al., “Cloning of a Tumor-Associated Antigen: MOv18 and MOv19 Antibodies Recognize Folate-binding Protein,” Cancer Research, Vol. 51 (Nov. 15, 1991), at pp. 6125-31, report that folate-binding proteins are markers for ovarian cancer. Folate-receptor over-expression is also known for other cancers such as, for example, skin, renal, breast, lung, colon, nose, throat, mammary gland, and brain cancers, as well as other cancers referenced herein.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are useful and can be delivered as epothilone-derived microtubule-stabilizing agents to tumors that express a folate receptor. They are useful in the treatment of a variety of cancers and other proliferative diseases, particularly those cancers characterized by cancer cells or tumors that express the folate receptor. The term “folate-receptor associated condition” as used herein comprises diseases or disorders characterized by expression of the folate receptor, or in other words, those diseases or disorders that can be diagnosed or treated based on the level of expression of the folate receptor in diseased tissue as compared with normal tissue.

A preferred range includes a dosage of about 0.02 to 5 mg/kg of body weight, with a range of about 0.05-0.3, being most preferred. It will be understood that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular subject can be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the species, age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the subject, the mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and severity of the particular condition. Preferred subjects for treatment include animals, most preferably mammalian species such as humans, and domestic animals such as dogs, cats and the like, subject to microtubule-stabilization associated conditions.\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention, such as compounds disclosed in one or more of the following examples, have been tested in one or more of the assays described below and/or assays known in the field, and demonstrate a measurable level of activity as microtubule stabilizing agents.\n\n\nAssays\n\n\nClonogenic Cell Survival Assay\n\n\nCancer cells were seeded at 3.0E+05 cells in a T75 flask with 10 ml of RPMI1640 media, free of folic acid, and containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 25 mM HEPES. Cells were grown in a 37° C. incubator containing 5% CO\n2 \nfor 2 days. On day 2, supernatants were removed from the flasks, and the flasks were divided into 2 groups. One group of cells were incubated with 5 ml of media containing 100 M of folic acid (Sigma) for 30 minutes and the others were grown in 5 ml of media without added folic acid. Cells were then treated with 20 nM of epothilone, epothilone analog, conjugated epothilone, or conjugated epothilone analog for one hour. At the end of the incubation, the drugs were removed from the flasks and the cells were washed with PBS buffer 3×. After washing, 5 ml of complete media were added into each flask, and the cell was grown in the CO\n2 \nincubator for 23 hours. The next morning, the cells were removed from the flasks by trypsinization, cell numbers were determined, and then cells were plated in a 6 well plates. Ten days after plating, colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted. The surviving fractions were determined.\n\n\nIn Vitro MTS Proliferation/Cytotoxicity Assay\n\n\nIn vitro cytotoxicity was assessed in tumor cells using a tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay which takes advantage of the metabolic conversion of MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt) to a reduced form that absorbs light at 492 nm. Cells were seeded 24 hr prior to addition of the epothilone, epothilone analog, conjugated epothilone, or conjugated epothilone analog. Following a 72 hour incubation at 37° C. with serially diluted compound, MTS, in combination with the electron coupling agent phenazine methosulfate, was added to the cells. The incubation was continued for 3 hours, then the absorbency of the medium at 492 nm was measured with a spectrophotometer to obtain the number of surviving cells relative to control populations. The results are expressed as median cytotoxic concentrations (IC\n50 \nvalues).\n\n\nFolate Receptor Assay\n\n\nAll sample preparation procedures used for the FR assay were performed at 4° C. Tissue samples were homogenized in homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.02 mg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin; 1 ml buffer/50 mg tissue) using a PowerGen 125 homogenizer. Large debris was removed by mild centrifugation (3000×g for 15 min). Membrane pellets were then collected by centrifugation at 40,000×g for 60 min and resuspended in solubilization buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.02% sodium azide). Insoluble material was removed by a second 40,000×g 60 min centrifugation, and the total protein concentration of the supernatants was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Pierce Chemical). Each sample was then diluted to 0.25 mg/ml in solubilization buffer, and 100 μl was placed inside each of two Microcon-30 microconcentrators (30,000-MW cutoff, Millipore). Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000×g for 10 min at room temperature to pass all of the liquid through the membrane, as well as to retain the solubilized FRs on the surface of the microconcentrator's membrane. All subsequent centrifugation steps were performed using these same parameters. Then 55 μl of 30 mM acetate buffer (pH 3.0) was added to each microconcentrator, followed by a centrifugation step. Next, 55 μl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was dispensed into each microconcentrator, followed by another centrifugation. Then 50 μl of [\n3\nH]folic acid binding reagent (120 nM [\n3\nH]folic acid (Amersham) in 10 mM Na\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.8 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, pH 7.4, containing 500 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 25 mM n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside) or 50 μl of a competing reagent (binding reagent plus 120 μM unlabeled folic acid) was added to the appropriate concentrators. Following a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the concentrators were washed/centrifuged three times with 75 \nμl\n 50 mM n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, 0.7 M NaCl in PBS, pH 7.4. After the final wash, the retentates containing the solubilized FRs were recovered from the membrane surface of the microconcentrators by two rinses with 100 μl of PBS containing 4% Triton X-100. The samples were then counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Bioscience). Counts per minute (cpm) values were converted to picomoles of FR based on the cpm of a known standard, and the final results were normalized with respect to the sample protein content.\n\n\nAnimals and Tumors\n\n\nFemale CD2F1 mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley Inc., 20-22 g) maintained in a controlled environment and provided with water and food ad libitum were used in these studies. The murine FRα(−) Madison 109 (M109) lung carcinoma (Marks et al., 1977) and the FR-expressing (FRα(+)) 98M109 variant were used to evaluate the efficacy of the epothilone, epothilone analog (e.g., epothilone derivative), folate-epothilone conjugate, or folate-epothilone analog conjugate. In addition, the human head and neck epidermoid carcinoma KB grown in nude mice was also used for this purpose.\n\n\nDrug Treatment and Antitumor Efficacy Evaluation\n\n\nFor administration of epothilone or epothilone analogs to mice, an excipient consisting of the following was used: CREMOPHOR®/ethanol/water (1:1:8, v/v). The compounds were first dissolved in a mixture of CREMOPHOR®/ethanol (50:50). Final dilution to the required dosage strength was made less than 1 hr before drug administration. Mice were administered the agents by bolus IV injection through the tail vein. Folate-epothilone conjugates or folate-epothilone analog conjugates were prepared in sterile phosphate buffered saline and administered to mice by IV bolus injection through the tail vein at a volume of 0.01 mL/g of mice. Treatment of each animal was based on individual body weight.\n\n\nThe required number of animals needed to detect a meaningful response were pooled at the start of the experiment and each was given a subcutaneous inoculation of a tumor brei (2% w/v). Tumors were allowed to grow for 4 days. On the fourth day, animals were evenly distributed to various treatment and control groups. Treated animals were checked daily for treatment related toxicity/mortality. Each group of animals was weighed before the initiation of treatment (Wt1) and then again following the last treatment dose (Wt2). The difference in body weight (Wt2−Wt1) provides a measure of treatment-related toxicity.\n\n\nTumor response was determined by measurement of tumors with a caliper twice a week, until the tumors reached a predetermined “target” size of 1 gm. Tumor weights (mg) were estimated from the formula:\n\n\nTumor weight=(length×width\n2\n)÷2\n\n\n\nAntitumor activity was evaluated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which is defined as the dose level immediately below which excessive toxicity (i.e. more than one death) occurred. When death occurred, the day of death was recorded. Treated mice dying prior to having their tumors reach target size were considered to have died from drug toxicity. No control mice died bearing tumors less than target size. Treatment groups with more than one death caused by drug toxicity were considered to have had excessively toxic treatments and their data were not included in the evaluation of a compound's antitumor efficacy.\n\n\nTumor response end-point was expressed in terms of tumor growth delay (T-C value), defined as the difference in time (days) required for the treated tumors (T) to reach a predetermined target size compared to those of the control group (C).\n\n\nTo estimate tumor cell kill, the tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) was first calculated with the formula:\n\n\nTVDT=Median time (days) for control tumors to reach target size−Median time (days) for control tumors to reach half the target size\n\n\nAnd,\n\n\nLog cell kill=T-C÷(3.32×TVDT)\n\n\nStatistical evaluations of data were performed using Gehan's generalized Wilcoxon test.\n\n\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\n\nThe following abbreviations are used in the schemes and Examples herein for ease of reference:\n\n \n \nCBZ-OSu=N-(Benzyloxycarbonyloxy)succinimide\n \nDCM=dichloromethane\n \nDEA=diethylamine\n \nDIAD=diisopropyl azodicarboxylate\n \nDIPEA=diisopropylethylamine\n \nDMA=dimethylamine\n \nDMF=dimethyl formamide\n \nDMSO=dimethylsufoxide\n \nEDC=1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride\n \nEtOH=ethanol\n \nEtOAc=ethyl acetate\n \nFR=folate receptor\n \nHOBt=n-hydroxy benzotriazole\n \nHPCL=high performance liquid chromatography\n \niPr—OH or IPA=isopropyl alcohol\n \nLC/MS=liquid chromatography/mass spec\n \nLDA=lithium diisopropylamide\n \nMeOH=methanol\n \nOTES=o-triethylsilyl;\n \nOMs=mesylate;\n \nPh=phenyl\n \nPd/C=palladium on carbon\n \nPyBOP=benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate\n \nPy=pyridyl\n \nRT=room temperature\n \nSat'd=saturated\n \nTHF=tetrahydrofuran\n \nTFA=trifluoroacetic acid\n \nTLC=thin layer chromatography\n \nTESCL=chlorotriethylsilane\n \nUV=ultraviolet.\n \n\n\nMethods of Preparation\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention may generally be prepared according to the following schemes and the knowledge of one skilled in the art, and/or using methods set forth in U.S. Pat.

For example a compound of formula II where R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, and R\n12 \nare methyl, B\n1 \nis hydroxyl, R\n1 \nand R\n6 \nare hydrogen, and R\n2 \nis 2-methylthiazol-4-yl is referred to as epothilone A and can be obtained from fermentation of Sorangium cellulosum as referenced above. A compound of formula II can be converted to a compound of formula III where P is a silyl protecting group such as triethylsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl, triisopropylsilyl, and the like (see, e.g., Greene et al., “Protective groups in Organic Synthesis”, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.). For example, a compound of formula III where P is triethylsilyl can be prepared by treatment of a compound of formula II with chlorotriethylsilane in the presence of Hunig's base. In the case where B\n1 \nis hydroxyl in the compound of formula II, then B\n1 \nwould also be converted to the corresponding silyl ether. A halohydrin of formula IV (Y is Cl, Br, or I) can be prepared from a compound of formula III by treatment with a metal halide salt by methods known in the art. For example, epoxide opening using magnesium bromide etherate at low temperature (−20 to −5° C.) can provide diastereomeric halohydrins, where Y is bromine. A compound of formula V can be prepared from a compound of formula IV by displacement of the halogen using, for example, sodium azide in a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide. An ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize that the stereochemistry at C\n12 \nas depicted in Scheme I should not be construed as limiting, but rather exemplary. If desired, inversion of the stereochemistry at the C\n12 \nposition can be achieved following the Mitsunobu protocol which is well established in the art. For example, treatment of a compound of formula V with p-nitrobenzoic acid, diethylazodicarboxylate, and triphenylphosphine provides the corresponding nitrobenzoate ester, which can then be cleaved by mild ester hydrolysis using, for example, methanolic solutions of ammonia to provide a compound of formula VI. Again, the stereochemistry for C\n12 \nas depicted for compound VI is not limiting, and is depicted as such to show that treatment of compound V as described will invert the stereochemistry at that position. Alternatively, other organic acids, azodicarboxylates, and organophosphines can be used to effect the Mitsonuobu inversion. A compound of formula VII where OG is a leaving group such as mesylate, tosylate, nosylate, triflate and the like can be prepared from a compound of formula VI by methods known in the art. For example, treatment of VI with methanesulfonyl chloride and triethylamine in a suitable organic solvent such as dichloromethane provides a compound of formula VII where OG is mesylate. A compound of formula VIII can be prepared from a compound of formula VII by reduction of the azido group with a reducing agent such as an organophosphine (e.g., trimethylphosphine). Alternatively, a compound of formula VIII can be prepared directly from a compound of formula VI using an organophosphine reducing agent such as triphenylphosphine. A compound of formula IX can be prepared from a compound of formula VIII by methods known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,653; and Regueiro-Ren et al., Organic Letters, 2001, 3, 2693-2696). For instance, a compound of formula IX where H—K-A- is 2-hydroxyethyl can be prepared from a compound of formula VIII by alkylation of the aziridine ring using, for example, excess 2-bromoethanol and a base such as potassium carbonate. A compound of formula X can be prepared from a compound of formula IX by removal of the silyl ether protecting groups using methods known in the art (see, e.g., Greene et al., “Protective groups in Organic Synthesis”, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.). For instance, when P is triethylsilyl, treatment of a compound of formula IX with trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane effects deprotection to provide a compound of formula X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 2 shows a process for making a folate analog or derivative V and bivalent linker T-Q having the formula XI, below, that may be used with compounds of the invention to make conjugated molecules for targeted drug delivery, e.g., as per formula I, previously described. As shown in Scheme 2, a folate analog and bivalent linker can be assembled using methods known in the art, especially in the case where V is folic acid or a folic acid analog, as described, for example, by Jackson, et al., Advanced Drug Delivery Rev. 56 (2004) 1111-1125, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference, and T-Q is a peptide. For example, peptidyl folate XI can be prepared as shown in Scheme 2. Sequential peptide coupling of a cysteine-loaded polystyrene resin with Fmoc-protected aspartate, arginine, aspartate, and then glutamate can be effected using PyBOP as coupling agent and piperidine as Fmoc-deprotection agent. N\n10\n-Trifluoroacetamide-protected pteroic acid can be prepared in two steps by enzymatic (carboxypeptidase G) conversion of folic acid to pteroic acid, followed by N\n10\n-protection using trifluoroacetic anhydride. Next, coupling of the N\n10\n-protected pteroic acid to the resin-bound peptide followed by cleavage from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid and removal of the N\n10\n-trifluoroacetyl group using ammonium hydroxide provides a V-T-Q fragment of a compound of formula I where V is folic acid and T-Q is -Asp-Arg-Asp-Cys-OH. Alternatively, pteroic acid analogs could be used in place of pteroic acid and other amino acids, could be used in place of those illustrated in Scheme 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 3, below, shows a method for using the epothilone derivatives of the present invention to prepare a conjugated molecule of formula I, for use in targeted drug delivery. As shown in Scheme 3, assembly of compounds of formula I can be achieved by coupling compounds of formula X to a fragment V-T-Q by stepwise incorporation of a releasable linker M. By way of illustration, a compound of formula X where -A-K—H is —CH\n2\nCH\n2\nOH can be converted to a disulfanylethyl carbonate XIII using an activated benzotriazole compound of formula XII. A compound of formula XII can be prepared from mercaptoethanol, methoxycarbonyl sulfenyl chloride, and an optionally substituted 2-mercaptopyridine to provide an intermediate 2-(2-pyridin-2-yl) disulfanyl)ethanol, which can then be converted to a compound of formula XII by treatment with diphosgene and an optionally substituted 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Subsequent disulfide exchange with a peptidyl folate such as XI provides a compound of formula I where V is folic acid, T-Q is a -Asp-Arg-Asp-Cys-OH, M is —SCH\n2\nCH\n2\nO(C═O)—, A is —CH\n2\nCH\n2\n— and K is O,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 4 illustrates an alternative method for making a compound of formula X from a compound of formula XIV (see, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/940,088, filed May 25, 2006, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference). Compounds of formula XIV can be obtained by methods well known in the field, for example, by fermentation (see, e.g. Gerth et al., “Studies on the Biosynthesis of Epothilones: The Biosynthetic Origin of the Carbon Skeleton,” Journal of Antibiotics, Vol. 53, No. 12 (December 2000), and Hofle et al., “Epothilone A and B-Novel 16-Membered Macrolides: Isolation, Crystal Structure, and Conformation in Solution”, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., Vol. 35, No. 13/14, 1567-1569 (1996), the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference) or by total synthesis (see, e.g. Vite et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,605,599; 6,242,469; 6,867,333 and US Pat. Appl. Pub. 2006/004065, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). For example a compound of formula XIV where R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, and R\n12 \nare methyl, B\n1 \nis hydroxyl, R\n1 \nand R\n6 \nare hydrogen, and R\n2 \nis 2-methylthiazol-4-yl is referred to as epothilone C and can be obtained from fermentation of Sorangium cellulosum as referenced above. A compound of formula XIV can be converted to a compound of formula XV where P is a silyl protecting group such as triethylsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl, triisopropylsilyl, and the like (see, e.g., Greene et al., “Protective groups in Organic Synthesis”, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.). For example, a compound of formula XV where P is triethylsilyl can be prepared by treatment of a compound of formula XIV with chlorotriethylsilane in the presence of base such as Hunig's base. In the case where B\n1 \nis hydroxyl in the compound of formula XIV, then B\n1 \nwould also be converted to the corresponding silyl ether. A halohydrin of formula XVI or XVII (Y is Cl, Br, or I) can be prepared from a compound of formula XV by treatment with a halogenating agent such as Y\n2\n. For example, electrophilic addition in polar solvents such as acetonitrile using iodine can stereoselectively provide regioisomeric halohydrins of formulas XVI and XVII, where Y is iodine. Alternatively N-halo succinimides can also be used for the same transformation. A compound of formula XVIII can be prepared from compounds of formulas XVI and/or XVII by epoxide ring closure in the presence of bases such as triethylamine or Hunig's base in a polar/aqueous solvent system such as acetonitrile/water. If desired, compound XIV can be directly transformed into a compounds of formula XVI and/or XVII (where P is H), which could then be converted into the epoxide XVIII (where P is H). A compound of formula XVIII can be transformed into the azido-alcohols of formulas VI and XIX by azide displacement in the presence of inorganic azide salts or tetraalkyl ammonium azides in alcoholic solvents. In the case where P is a silyl protecting group, compounds of formulas XX and/or XXI where OG is a leaving group such as mesylate, tosylate, nosylate, trifiate and the like can be prepared from compounds of formulas VI and/or XIX by methods known in the art. For example, treatment of VI and/or XIX with methanesulfonyl chloride and triethylamine in a suitable organic solvent such as dichloromethane provides compounds of formulas XX and XXI where OG is mesylate. A compound of formula VIII can be prepared from compounds of formulas XX and/or XXI by reduction of the azido group through methods known in the art. For example, compound VIII can be prepared from compounds of formulas XX and/or XXI through reaction with a reducing agent such as an organophosphine (e.g., trimethylphosphine) in polar solvents such as acetonitrile. Alternatively, when P is H, compound of formula VIII can be directly prepared from compounds of formulas VI and/or XIX by reduction of the azido group with a reducing agent such as an organophosphine (e.g., triphenylphosphine) in polar solvents such as acetonitrile. A compound of formula IX can be prepared from a compound of formula VIII by methods known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,653; and Regueiro-Ren et al., Organic Letters, 2001, 3, 2693-2696). For instance, a compound of formula IX where H—K-A- is 2-hydroxyethyl can be prepared from a compound of formula VIII by alkylation of the aziridine ring using, for example, excess 2-bromoethanol and a base such as potassium carbonate. In case P is a trialkylsilyl, a compound of formula X can be prepared from a compound of formula IX by removal of the silyl ether protecting groups using methods known in the art (see, e.g., Greene et al., “Protective groups in Organic Synthesis”, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.). For instance, when P is triethylsilyl, treatment of a compound of formula IX with trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane effects deprotection to provide a compound of formula X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe invention will now be further described with reference to the following illustrative examples.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nFolate Conjugated Epothilone Analogs\n\n\nAs described in the detailed description above, analogs and derivatives of folate are described in Vlahov. In research and development directed toward folate receptor targeting to tumor cells of conjugated epothilone and epothilone analog compounds, several compounds were conjugated to folate. For example, Compound AA and Compound BB were considered as candidates for conjugation to folic acid:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound AA has activity in Phase II clinical trials, and six folate conjugates of Compound AA (Compounds AA.I to AA.VI; see \nFIG. 1\n) were prepared and optionally tested for chemical stability, FR binding, and FR-mediated activity in cell culture.\n\n\nThe binding of these folate conjugates of Compound AA to FR was determined in an assay that measures displacement of radiolabeled folic acid from FR expressed on KB tumor cells grown to confluence. Finding of the folate conjugates of Compounds AA.I and AA.II to FR was deemed acceptable [relative affinity (RA)>0.25; RA of folic acid=1.0]. However, surprisingly, none of the six conjugates of Compound AA shown in \nFIG. 1\n displayed appreciable cytotoxicity against KB tumor cells in antiproliferation assays that measure \n3\nH-thymidine incorporation (data not shown).\n\n\nSince conjugates of Compound AA demonstrated disappointing cytotoxicity against tumor cells, studies were conducted using three conjugates of Compound BB (Compounds BB.I to BB.III). Compound BB is also known as epothilone F, and is an analog of Compound AA, where the 21-amino group is replaced by a 21-hydroxyl group. While Compound BB.II (\nFIG. 2\n) displayed cytotoxicity at high concentrations, the activity was not attenuated in competition studies using excess of folic acid. Therefore, the observed cytotoxicity was attributed to non-specific release of Compound BB.II.\n\n\nOther epothilone analogs, e.g., aziridinyl epothilones, are known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,399,638; Regueiro-Ren, A, et al. (2001) Org. Letters. 3:2693-96) and show potent antitumor cytotoxicity. For example, an MTS assay that compared the relative cytotoxic potency of a number of epothilone analogs against a pair of taxane-resistant cancer cell lines (HCTVM46 and A2790Tax) was conducted (see Table 1). HCTVM46 is a human colon carcinoma cell line derived from the sensitive HCT116 parent line, and is resistant to taxanes due to overexpression of the 170 kD p-glyprotein drug efflux transporter. A2780Tax is a human ovarian carcinoma cell line derived from the parent A2780 line, and is resistant to paclitaxel as a result of a mutation in the tubulin amino acid sequence that impairs the ability of paclitaxel to bind.\n\n\nAs is shown in Table 1, various aziridinyl epothilone analogs (Compounds CC-EE) show potent antitumor activity against both the HCT116 colon and A2780 ovarian carcinoma cell lines, compared to other known antitumor agents, e.g., paclitaxel, compound AA, and epothilone B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn vitro activity of 12,13-aziridinyl epothilones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHCT116\n\n\n \n\n\nA2780\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCom-\n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nR/S\n\n\nIC\n5\n \n\n\nR/S\n\n\n\n\n\n\npound\n\n\nR\n\n\n(nM)\n1\n \n\n\nRatio\n2\n \n\n\n(nM)\n1\n \n\n\nRatio\n3\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCC\n\n\n—H\n\n\n4.2 ± 2.8\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n3.4 ± 1.5\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD\n\n\n—CH\n3\n \n\n\n0.37 ± 0.13\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.25 ± 0.06\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEE\n\n\n—CH\n2\nCH\n2\nOCH\n3\n \n\n\n0.40 ± 0.25\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n0.22 ± 0.12\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\npacli-\n\n\n—\n\n\n3.3 ± 1.0\n\n\n150\n\n\n3.1 ± 1.0\n\n\n22.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntaxel\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAA\n\n\n—\n\n\n1.2 ± 0.3\n\n\n14.8\n\n\n1.1 ± 0.4\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpothil-\n\n\n—\n\n\n0.40 ± 0.13\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.23 ± 0.09\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\none B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nMean IC\n50 \n± SD calculated from four separate experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2\nR/S ratio = HCT116 IC\n50\n/HCT116VM46 IC\n50\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n3\nR/S ratio = A2780 IC\n50\n/A2780Tax IC\n50\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the antitumor activities of aziridinyl epothilone compounds CC-EE, the only hydroxyl groups on these molecules available for conjugation to folate are those found at the C\n3 \nand C\n7 \ncarbon atoms. Consequently, having researched a number of epothilone compounds and analogs, there remained a challenge to discover a compound that would be readily available for conjugation to folate, and which would demonstrate activity via specific release of the active epothilone moiety in the tumor cells.\n\n\nThe aziridinyl epothilone compound G was discovered, having the formula,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound G (see Examples 2 and 3) proved surprisingly easy to conjugate to folic acid to form Compound J (see Example 2) with relative affinity of 0.77 for folate receptor, when compared to folic acid.\n\n\nUnexpectedly, the polar hydroxyl group on the aziridine side chain did not adversely affect the antitumor activity of the aziridine epothilone analogs. This is important because it is the aziridine epothilone analog, e.g., Compound G, that mediates the antitumor effects upon release from folic acid. The potency of Compound G, and three other highly potent epothilone analogs (ixabepilone, Compound AA, and Compound BB) were evaluated by the colony formation assay that is described above. The concentration needed to kill 90% of clonogenic KB cancer cells (IC\n90\n) was determined after a drug exposure duration of 17 hours. As shown in \nFIG. 3\n, compound G exhibited an IC\n90 \nof 4.3 nM and was ˜2, 4, and 6-fold more potent than compound CC, compound AA, and ixabepilone, respectively.\n\n\nConjugation of compound G to form Compound J did not affect the antitumor activity of compound G. Compound J demonstrated substantial cytotoxic activity against tumor cells in vivo. In the KB in vivo FRα(+) tumor model, compound J demonstrated activity both at is maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and at two lower does levels that produced minimal toxicity (see \nFIG. 4\n). In contrast, ixabepilone was active only at its MTD (5 μmol/kg). When compared at the MTDs, compound J produced superior antitumor effects than ixabepilone (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, with the FRα(−) M109 parent tumor model, Compound J had poor activity at all dose levels tested, including at its MTD (2.4 μmol/kg), whereas ixabepilone was active at its MTD of 5 μmol/kg. (\nFIG. 5\n). These results indicate that the FRα(−) M109 is sensitive to ixabepilone and the inactivity of compound J is likely largely a consequence of the absence of FRα expression by this tumor. These results also provide evidence that the antitumor activity of compound J may be mediated through the FRα receptors.\n\n\nFurther evidence of the FRα mediated drug delivery mechanism of compound J is provided by the observation that co-administration of a folate analog at 20-fold excess of the dose of compound J could substantially compete with compound J for receptor binding and protect FRα(+) 98M109 tumors from the antitumor effects of compound J. (\nFIG. 6\n). Since Compound G and the conjugate (Compound J) have surprising anti-tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo, and since the antitumor activities of Compound J may be attributed to FRα(+)-mediated effects, also described herein is the conjugation of aziridinyl epothilone analog Compound G (see Examples 2 and 3) to form Compound J. (See Example 2).\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nPreparation of Compound J\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(S)-2-(4-((2-amino-4-oxo-3,4-dihydropteridin-6-yl)methylamino)benzamido)-5-((S)-3-carboxy-1-(S)-1-((S)-3-carboxy-1-((R)-1-carboxy-2-(2-(2-((2-((1S,3S,7S,10R,11S, 12S, 16R)-7,11-dihydroxy-8,8,10,12-tetramethyl-3-((E)-1-(2-methylthiazol-4-yl)prop-1-en-2-yl)-5,9-dioxo-4-oxa-17-aza-bicyclo[14.1.0]heptadecan-17-yl)ethoxy)carbonyloxy)ethyl)disulfanyl)ethylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-ylamino)-5-guanidino-1-oxopentan-2-ylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-ylamino)-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n\nA.

The mixture was bubbled for 1 hr and washed 3× with DMF and isopropyl alcohol. FMOC deprotection was effected by treatment with 20% piperidine in DMF, 2× (10 min), before each amino acid coupling. This sequence was repeated for each amino acid coupling step.\n\n\nSynthesis of N\n10\n-TFA-protected pteroic acid:\n\n\nTo 10 L of 0.1 M tris base solution (121.1 g tris base in 10 L water) in a 22 L mechanically-stirred round bottomed flask, equipped with a heating mantle, was added 200 g (0.453 mole) of folic acid. The mixture was stirred to dissolve the folic acid, and then 500 mg (3.67 mmole) zinc chloride was added. Carboxypeptidase G (13×20 unit vials available from Sigma) was added and the pH was adjusted to 7.3 with 1N HCl and maintained throughout the reaction. The mixture was protected from light and heated at 30° C. for 8-10 days (use of an auto-titrator to hold the pH constant reduced the conversion time by 4-5 days). The reaction was monitored by analytical HPLC until 80% conversion was achieved (further conversion is desirable but has not been optimized). The product was precipitated from the reaction mixture by adjusting the solution to pH=3.0 using 6N HCl. The slurry was transferred to a centrifuge vial and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted. The wet solid was then directly purified as follows (the wet solid could be frozen for storage or first freeze-dried; however, storage of wet solids in the freezer until dissolution was more efficient). To 40 g of crude pteroic acid in 700 mL of water was added 1.0 M NaOH until pH=11.5. The mixture was filtered (Whatman type 1) and then chromatographed (column: 10×120 cm; stationary phase: 8 kg DEAE cellulose; mobile phase: 1.0 M NaCl/0.01 M NaOH, pH=11.5; flow rate: 17 ml/min). One liter yellow-colored fractions were collected and analyzed by HPLC. Fractions containing pure pteroic acid were adjusted to pH=3 with 6 M HCl to precipitate pteroic acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was decanted and washed with water (3×). The solid was freeze-dried for at least 72 hr. The impact of residual water on the next reaction is not known.\n\n\nThe pteroic acid was further dried over P\n2\nO\n5 \nunder high vacuum for over 24 hr (note that similar results in the protection step were obtained without this additional drying step). Next, 100 g (0.32 mol) of pteroic acid was added to a 5 L round bottom flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer and an argon inlet, and stored under high vacuum overnight. Argon gas was added followed by 3500 g (2316 mL) of trifluoroacetic anhydride. The flask was sealed with a rubber stopper or argon inlet adaptor, and then stirred vigorously. The flask was protected from light and stirred at room temperature under argon atmosphere for 7 days (the reaction was monitored by HPLC of aliquots diluted 20× each with water and DMSO). The mixture was rotary evaporated to dryness and treated with 2.5 L of 3% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature to hydrolyze anhydride by-products. Rotary evaporation gave a dry solid. The solid was suspended in 2 L of water and then centrifuged in 250-mL centrifuge bottles at 3000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was removed and the solid was washed with water and centrifuged (4 times). The solid was freeze-dried for 3 days, transferred to amber bottles, and dried under high vacuum in the presence of P\n2\nO\n5 \nfor 2 days (Purity≧95%; residual TFA assessed by Elemental Analysis).\n\n\nCleavage step:\n\n\nThe protected intermediate was released from the resin using the cleavage reagent prepared from 92.5% (50 mL) TFA, 2.5% (1.34 mL) H\n2\nO, 2.5% (1.34 mL) Triisopropylsilane, and 2.5% (1.34 mL) ethanedithiol. The cleavage reagent was added to the reaction vessel (25 mL). Argon was bubbled through the mixture for 1.5 hr. The liquid was drained from the vessel, and resin was washed with remaining reagent (3×8 mL). The volatiles were concentrated by rotary evaporation to a volume of 10 mL. Diethyl ether (35.0 mL) was added to effect precipitation. The solid was collected by centrifugation and dried to give 1.25 g of cleavage product.\n\n\nDeprotection Step:\n\n\nThe N\n10\n-trifluoroacetyl protecting group in the pteroic acid portion was removed under basic conditions. Starting with 250 mg of protected intermediate in 10 mL water, the pH was adjusted to 9.3 and maintained for 1 hr using 4:1H\n2\nO:ammonium hydroxide (1-2 mL). After 1 hr, the pH was adjusted to 5 with 1N HCl (˜1 mL) and the product was purified on preparative HPLC to yield 125 mg of Compound H.\n\n\nHPLC Purification Conditions:\n\n\nColumn: Waters NovaPak C\n18 \n300×9 mm\n\n\nSolvent A: \nBuffer\n 10 mM Ammonium Acetate, pH=5\n\n\nSolvent B: Acetonitrile\n\n\nElution: 1% B to 20% B in 40 min at 15 mL/min\n\n\nTotal yield from combined reactions: 625 mg\n\n\nI.

The mixture was added dropwise over a period of 20 min. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to RT and stirred for an additional 1 hr. TLC analysis of the reaction mixture showed that the starting material was consumed and there was formation of a “streaking” less polar chloroformate product, TLC (6:4 EtOAc:Hexanes): R\nF \nof starting material 0.4; R\nF \nof chloroformate product: 0.8.\n\n\nThe reaction mixture was stirred in a roundbottom flask under argon and cooled by an ice/salt bath. A mixture of 3.02 g, 22.4 mmol HOBt and 2.23 g, 22.0 mmol triethylamine in 10 mL anhydrous dichloromethane was added to a dropping funnel affixed to the roundbottom flask. The mixture was slowly added to the roundbottom flask maintaining the reaction temperature at 2° C. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to RT and stirred overnight. Approximately 27 mL of dichloromethane was then distilled from the reaction mixture at atmospheric pressure. The mixture was then allowed to cool to RT and stir for 2 hr. The solids were collected by filtration, and the filter cake was washed with 20 mL of dichloromethane. The solids were then dried under vacuum at 40° C. on a rotary evaporator to afford 7.81 g of off-white solids. This product was analyzed by 1H-NMR and determined to be the desired product.\n\n\n3.
