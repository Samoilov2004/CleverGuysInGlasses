More particularly, the present invention relates to novel cyclic pentadepsipeptides with excellent multidrug resistance-reversing activity and inhibitory activity against cancer cells, which are produced by a soil stain of the genus \nFusarium.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n[Background Art]\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA fungus of the genus \nFusarium\n distributed in association with higher marine plants has proven to be a promising source for the production of sansalvamide, a kind of cytotoxic cyclic depsipeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSansalvamide A was first reported to be produced by \nHalodule wrightii,\n a kind of marine microorganisms [\nBelofsky GN, Jensen PR, Fenical W. (1999) Sansalvamide: A new cytotoxic cyclic depsipeptide produced by a marine fungus of the genus Fusarium. Tetrahedron Lett. 40, 2913-2916\n]. It is composed of four hydrophobic amino acid residues (phenylalanine, two leucines, valine) and one hydroxy acid ((S)-2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic acid; O-Leu) with five stereogenic centers all having S-stereochemistry. Sansalvamide A was found to have marked anti-proliferative effects on 60 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute, with inhibitory activity against topoisomerase I. Anti-cancer effects of Sansalvamide A may be, at least in part, mediated by this mechanism. Further, the analogues formed by N-methylation or para-bromination of sansalvamide A of \nFIG. 1\n were also found to exhibit remarkable cytotoxicity against human pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that these cyclic compounds may be highly useful as anti-cancer agents [\nUjiki MB, Milam B, Ding XZ, Roginsky AB, Salabat MR, Talamonti MS, Bell RH, Gu W, Silverman RB, Adrian TE. (2006) A novel peptide sansalvamide analogue inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth through G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest. Biochem. Bioph. Res. Co. 340, 1224-1228\n].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, N-methylsansalvamide, a sansalvamide analogue with N-methylation, has been produced from different \nFusarium\n species isolated from green algae. It consists of four amino acid residues (phenylalanine, leucine, N-methylleucine and valine) and one hydroxy acid (O-Leu). N-Methylsansalvamide was reported to exhibit in \nvitro\n cytotoxicity in the NCI human tumor cell line screen [\nCueto M, Jensen PR, Fenical W. (2000) N-Methylsansalvamide, a cytotoxic cyclic depsipeptide from a marine fungus of the genus Fusarium. Phytochemistry. 55, 223-226\n].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMultidrug resistance (MDR) is arising as one of the major obstacles to successful chemotherapy for human cancer. A variety of biochemical, pharmacological and clinical strategies for overcoming MDR have been designed and suggested [\nTeodori E, Dei S, Scapecchi S, Gualtieri F. (2002) The medicinal chemistry of multidrug resistance (MDR) reversing drugs. II Farmaco 57, 385-415\n]. Although there are several mechanisms associated with MDR, the overexpression of P-glycoproteins (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP) is known to be responsible for the development of MDR in cancer cells [\nThomas H, Coley HM. (2003) Overcoming multidrug resistance in cancer: an update on the clinical strategy of inhibiting P-glycoprotein. Cancer Control 10, 159-165\n;\n Perez-Tomas R. (2006) Multidrug resistance: retrospect and prospects in anti-cancer drug treatment. Curr. Med. Chem. 13, 1859-1876\n].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSansalvamide A is a lipophilic, cyclic depsipeptide, which is of protease resistance and membrane permeability, so that it may advantageously take an oral route, compared to other drugs. In addition, forming a cyclic core structure, composed of four amino acids and one hydroxy acid, in which rotation around C-C bonds is restricted, sansalvamide A has a firm conformation which is of excellent compatibility to the body and enjoys a long half life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough there have been a number of sansalvamide analogues synthesized to utilize the structural merits and the cytotoxicity against cancer cells of sansalvamide A or N-methylsansalvamide, none of them are concerned with separated, cyclic pentadepsipeptides.\n\n\n \n\n\n[Disclosure]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Technical Problem]\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a strain of the genus \nFusarium\n producing novel cyclic pentadepsipeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is another object of the present invention to provide a method of producing the novel cyclic pentadepsipeptides by culturing a strain of the genus \nFusarium.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a further object of the present invention to provide novel cyclic pentadepsipeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a still further object of the present invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition for reversing multidrug resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is still another object of the present invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with an aspect thereof, the present invention pertains to a novel cyclic peptadepsipeptide represented by Chemical Formula 1 or 2:\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclic pentadepsipeptides, represented by Chemical Formulas 1 and 2, according to the present invention are 15-membered ring compounds which are proven novel with a difference from conventionally reported sansalvamide A and N-methylsansalvamide in the sequence of their constitutional amino acids and hydroxy acid. As seen in \nFIG. 1\n, conventional analogues synthesized on the basis of the core structure of sansalvamide A are intended to increase in cytotoxicity as a result of the bromination of the benzene ring of phenyl alanine or the methylation of leucine or valine. Nowhere has an attempt to change the sequence of the constitutional amino acids and hydroxy acid of sansalvamide A or N-methylsansalvamide been mentioned in previous reports. Further, organic synthesis for altering the sequence of the constitutional amino acids and hydroxy acid is accompanied by the interruption of the ester bond between the hydroxy acid ((S)-2-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic acid; OLeu) and the phenylalanine within the core structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBeing different from sansalvamide A and N-methylsansalvamide in the sequence of the constitutional four amino acids and one hydroxy acid, the novel, cyclic pentadepsipeptides, represented by Chemical Formulas 1 and 2, according to the present invention have cytotoxicity over a wide spectrum of types of cancer that is as potent as that of sansalvamide A. Furthermore, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of Chemical Formulas 1 and 2 show the drug resistance-reversing activity which has not yet been reported in conventional analogues synthesized on the basis of the sansalvamide A or N-methylsansalvamide. Excellent drug resistance-reversing activity is found in the cyclic pentadepsipeptide of Chemical Formula 1. When pathogens or cells are exposed to chemotherapy, they may become resistant to the drug and possibly to other structurally unrelated drugs. The pathogens or cells are said to be drug-resistant when drugs meant to neutralize them have a reduced effect. As used herein, the term \"drug resistance-reversing activity\" is intended to mean not only suppressing the generation of drug-resistant cells or keeping the cells sensitive to the drugs, but also increasing or recuperating the sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to the drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHaving the ability to make drug-resistant cells sensitive to drugs or suppress the generation of drug-resistant cells, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 according to the present invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be useful in the treatment of multidrug-resistant cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be used in combination with conventional drug-resistant inhibitors such as cyclosporine or analogues, phenothiazine, thioxantheres, verapamil, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of Chemical Formulas 1 and 2 according to the present invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be used in combination with anticancer agents, that is, standard chemotherapy agents, in the treatment of cancer and preferably in the treatment of tumors resistant to drugs a priori or a posteriori.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with another aspect thereof, the present invention pertains to a \nFusarium\n strain producing the cyclic pentadepsipeptide of Chemical Formula 1 or 2. Preferably, the \nFusarium\n strain producing the novel compound is \nFusarium solani\n KCCM90040 [Accession No.: KCCM10881P].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with a further aspect thereof, the present invention pertains to a method for producing the cyclic pentadepsipeptide of Chemical Formula 1 or 2 by culturing the strain. This culturing is preferably conducted on a cereal substance. The cereal substance useful in the present invention is selected from among rice, wheat, maize, rye, Indian millet, barley and a combination thereof, preferably from among rice, wheat, maize and rye, more preferably from among rice and wheat, and most preferably rice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen cultured in a seawater-based medium, marine \nFusarium\n strains were reported to produce sansalvamide in an amount of 0.642 g per 17 liters [\nBelofsky GN,Jensen PR, Fenical W. (1999) Sansalvamide: A new cytotoxic cyclic depsipeptide produced by a marine fungus of the genus Fusarium. Tetrahedron Lett. 40, 2913-2916\n]. As for the \nFusarium\n strain CNL-619, its N-methylsansalvamide production was reportedly 3.1 mg/L in a seawater-based medium [\nCueto M, Jensen PR, Fenical W. (2000) N-Methylsansalvamide, a cytotoxic cyclic depsipeptide from a marine fungus of the genus Fusarium. Phytochemistry. 55, 223-226\n].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBeing produced from the marine \nFusarium\n strains, sansalvamide or N-methylsansalvamide requires a seawater-based medium for the production thereof. Further, the marine strains are very poor in the productivity of sansalvamide or N-methylsansalvamide per volume of medium. In contrast, the \nFusarium\n strain of the present invention is of soil origin and can produce the compound of Chemical Formula 1 or 2 in high yield on a solid cereal substance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cereal substance useful for culturing the strain is preferably rice. In order to produce the compound of Chemical Formula 1 or 2, the strain of the present invention is preferably cultured at a temperature of from 20 to 30Â°C and at an RH of from 20 to 50 % for 10 - 20 days. Optimally, it is cultured at 25.84Â°C and 37.99 % RH for 16.03 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA strain producing a cyclic depsipeptide was isolated from potatoes grown in Munkyoung Korea and identified as a strain of \nFusarium solani.\n It was named \nFusarium solani\n KCCM90040 and deposited with the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms on Jan. 15, 2008 with accession No. KCCM10881P according to the Budapest Treaty.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of produced by the strain were analyzed to be 15-membered ring compounds different from sansalvamide A and N-methylsansalvamide in the sequence of constitutional amino acids and hydroxy acid and identified as cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formula\n \n 1 or 2 in accordance with the present invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof shows inhibitory activity against drug-resistant cells, which may be tumor cells or antibiotic-resistant cells, and thus can be used as an active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting the drug resistance of cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThanks to their suppressive activity against tumor proliferation, the pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formula\n \n 1 and 2 in accordance with the present invention may also be used as an active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\", as used herein, means non-toxic organic or inorganic acid addition salts of the compounds of interest. Examples of the inorganic acids useful in the present invention include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, acid metal salts (e.g., sodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen sulfate), etc. Examples of the organic acid useful in the present invention include mono-, di- and tricarboxylic acid. Among the pharmaceutically acceptable acids, there may be mentioned, without implying any limitation, acetic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, maleic acid, hydroxymaleic acid, benzoic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, cinnamic acid, salicylic acid and 2-phenoxybenzoic acid. Other organic acids may be exemplified by methane sulfonic acid and 2-hydroxyethane sulfonic acid. Such salts can be either in hydrated or anhydrous form. The acid addition salts of these compounds are prepared using a typical method, for example, by dissolving a free base in a suitable solvent such as an aqueous solvent, an alcohol solvent or another acid-containing solvent, and then evaporating the solvent, or by reacting the free base with the organic solvent (in this case, the salt may be directly separated or obtained via concentration). Generally, the acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention are crystalline materials which can be dissolved in water or various hydrophilic organic solvents and generally display higher melting points compared to the free base forms thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for the treatment of cancer or diseases associated with multidrug resistance may be administered to subjects in need thereof. As used herein, the term \"subject\" is intended to include mammals such as goats, horses, cow, pigs, dogs, cats, mice, rats, etc. as well as primates such as humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective dosages of the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may vary depending on various factors including dosage units, the duration of treatment, the age and sex of the patient, traits of the tumor to be treated, drug resistance, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn combination with other anticancer agents, particularly chemical agents useful for the treatment of tumors, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be used. For reversing multidrug resistance, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be administered at an effective dose of from 15 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg. A unit daily dosage may contain 25 to 500 mg of the cyclic pentadepsipeptide of \n \nChemical Formula\n \n 1 or 2 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be in an oral or parenteral dosage form formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor use in the treatment of tumors, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are preferably administered at an effective dose, in combination with an anticancer agent, particularly, an agent for chemotherapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong the tumors which can be treated with the compounds of the present invention are benign or malignant tumors, neoplasms, melanoma, lymphoma, leukemia and sarcoma. Examples of the tumors include skin tumors (e.g., malignant melanoma and cutaneous mycosis fungoides), blood tumors (e.g, acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia), lymphoma (e.g. Hodgkin's disease, malignant lymphoma), gynecologic tumors (ovarian tumor, uterine tumor), urologic tumors (prostate tumor, bladder tumor, seminoma), soft tissue sarcoma, osteo- or non-osteosarcoma, breast tumors, pituitary tumors, thyroid gland tumors, adrenal cortex tumors, gastrointestinal tumors (esophagus tumor, stomach tumors, intestine tumor, and colon tumor), pancreatic tumors, liver tumors, larynx tumors, papilloma and lung tumors. The best therapeutic effects may be elicited when the compounds of the present invention are applied to multidrug-resistant tumors or tumors which become multidrug resistant. Among these tumors are colon tumors, lung tumors, stomach tumors and liver tumors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA cytotoxic agent is typical of the chemical agents which can be applied together with the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Examples of the agents for chemotherapy include cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, prednisone, 6-mercaptopurine, procarbazine, daunorubicin, vincristine, vinblastine, chlorambucil, cytosine arabinoside, 6-thioguanine, thio TEPA, 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine, 5-azacytidine, nitrogen mustard, 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), (1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea)(CCNU), busulfan, adriamycin, bleomycin, vindesine, Cycloleucine and methylglyoxal bis(guanyl hydrazone) (MGBG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective dosage of the chemical agent useful in the present invention may vary depending on various factors including the condition of the patient, the morphology and size of the tumor, kind of the agents, etc, and may be readily determined by those skilled in the art. Generally, the chemical agent may be administered in a smaller dose when administered in combination with the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof than when administered alone. The reason is because a large amount of the chemical agent may cause drug resistance. Also, a cocktail of chemical agents or surgery or radiotherapy may be used, together with the administration of the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Although the coadministration of the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and the chemical agent is described above, , they may not be in the same dosage form or may not be administered at the same time. Accordingly, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and the chemical agent may be administered in a mixture or at different times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn oral route is preferable. For use in oral administration, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be formulated into solid or liquid forms, such as capsules, pills, tablets, troches, lozenge, melts, powders, liquids, suspensions and emulsions. Typical of the solid dosage forms is a capsule. A capsule with a soft or hard gelatin envelope may contain a surfactant, a lubricant, and an inert filler such as lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate and corn starch. In another embodiment, the compounds of the present invention may be formulated into a tablet, together with a tablet base (e.g., lactose, sucrose, corn starch), a binder (e.g, acacia, corn starch or gelatin), a disintegrant (e.g., potato starch, alginic acid, corn starch and guar gum) for facilitating the degradation and dissolution of the tablet after administration, a lubricant (e.g., talc, stearic acid or magnesium stearate, calcium stearate or zinc stearate) for enhancing the release of tablet granules and preventing the attachment of the tablet drug to the tabletting die or punch, and a dye, a colorant and a fragrant for improving the color and taste of the tablet. Carriers suitable for use in oral liquid dosage forms include suspension agents, water mixed with or without an emulsifier, and a diluent such as an alcohol (ethanol, benzyl alcohol and polyethylene alcohol).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be administered in the form of a solution in a diluent, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, through a parenteral route, that is, a subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular or intraperitoneal route. Examples of the carrier for use in injection include pharmaceutically acceptable surfactants (e.g., soap or detergent), suspending agents (pectin, carbomer, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or carboxymethylcellulose), water or saline mixed with an emulsifier or another pharmaceutical adjuvant, aqueous solutions of dextrose or corresponding sugars, alcohols (e.g., ethanol, isopropanol, hexadecylalcohol), glycol (e.g., propylene glycol, or polyethylene glycol), glycerol ketal (e.g., 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-methanol), ethers (e.g., poly(ethylene-glycol)400), oils, and germ-free solutions or mixture containing fatty acids, fatty acid esters or glycerides, or acetylated fatty acid glycerides. Examples of the oil useful in the formulation of parenteral dosage forms include petroleum, animal oil, vegetable oil, or synthetic oil, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, sesame oil, cotton seed oil, corn oil, olive oil, mineral oil and inorganic oil. Among the fatty acids are oleic acid, stearic acid and isostearic acid. The fatty acid esters may be exemplified by oleic acid ethyl and myristic acid isopropyl. Alkaline metal salts, ammonium salt and triethanolamine salts of fatty acids may be suitable as the surfactant. Examples of the detergent include cationic detergents (e.g., dimethyl dialkyl ammonium halide, alkyl pyridium halide and alkylamine acetate), anionic detergents (e.g., alkyl, aryl and olefin sulfonate, alkyl, olefin, ether and monoglyceride sulfate and sulfosuccinate), non-ionic detergents (lipid amine oxide, fatty acid alkanolamide and polyoxyethylenepolypropylene copolymer), and amphiphatic detergents (e.g., alkyl-Î²-amino propionate and 2-alkylimidazolin quarternary ammonium salt) and a combination thereof. Typically, the parenteral compositions of this invention will contain from about 0.5% to about 25% by weight of the active ingredient in solution. Preservatives and buffers may also be used advantageously. In order to minimize or eliminate irritation at the site of injection, such compositions may contain a non-ionic surfactant having a hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) of from about 12 to about 17. The quantity of surfactant in such formulations ranges from about 5% to about 15% by weight. The surfactant can be a single component having the above HLB or can be a mixture of two or more components having the desired HLB.

[\nSamson RA, Hoekstra ES, Oorschot V, Connie AN. (1981) Introduction to food-borne fungi. Published and distributed by Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures\n \n;\n \nNelson PE, Toussoun TA, Marasas WF. (1983) Fusarium species: An illustrated manual for identification. The Pennsylvania State University Press\n \n].\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe isolated \nFusarium\n strain was transferred on carnation leaf agar (CLA) and real potato dextrose agar (RPDA) and analyzed for morphological characteristics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe microconidia were present in abundance generally in the form of single cells of an oval to kidney shape (\nFIG. 2\n). Conidiophores of the \nFusarium\n strain put out branches as shown \nFIG. 3\n. The microconidia and conidiophores of \nF. solani\n are morphologically similar to those of \nFusarium oxysporum.\n The microconidia of F. \noxysporum\n were observed to be larger in size and have thicker walls and conidiophores were formed on short monophialides, compared to those of \nF. solani\n (Nelson et al., 1983). The isolated \nFusarium\n strains grew fast. The slant surface of the agar was almost covered with white mycelia with the back being a dark cream (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom these morphological characteristics, the \nFusarium\n strain was identified as \nF. solani.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(2) Molecular Biological Identification\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. DNA Isolation\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe total genomic DNA of the isolated \nFusarium\n strain was extracted from the mycelia grown on PDA (potato dextrose agar) using the method of Correll [\nCorrell JC, Klittich CJR, Leslie JF. (1987) Nitrate nonutilizing mutants of Fusarium oxysporum and their use in vegetative compatibility tests. Phytopathology, 77, 16401646\n].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this regard, mycelium-covered agar was placed in a tube filled with liquid nitrogen, followed by evaporating the liquid nitrogen at room temperature. This procedure of liquid nitrogen filling and evaporation was repeated again. After evaporation of the liquid nitrogen, 0.5 mL of a lysis buffer [50mM Tris pH 8.0, 50mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid(EDTA), 3% sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), 1% 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 m/ml proteinase K] warmed to 65Â°C was added into the tube and incubated for 1 hr at 65Â°C. After incubation, 0.5 mL of a phenol solution was added and then spun for 5 min at 8,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge to separate a phenol phase and an aqueous phase from each other. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube. The phenol extraction was repeated again. Phenol residues in the aqueous phase were removed with 0.4 mL of a mixture of chloroform : isoamyl alcohol (24: 1). Ammonium acetate (0.05 ml, 7.5 M) was mixed gently with the aqueous phase. DNA was precipitated with 0.88 mL of 95% ethanol cold to - 20Â°C. The DNA pellet was spun down for 20 min at 13,000 rpm. The pellet was rinsed with 70% ethanol, spun down, and dried. The DNA was resuspended in TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and stored until use.\n\n\n \n\n\nB. Identification by DNA Electrophoresis and Homology Comparison\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusarium\n specific primers, P28SL (5'-ACA AAT TAC AAC TCG GGC CCG AGA-3') of SEQ ID NO: 1 and P58SL (5'-AGT ATT CTG GCG GGC ATG CCT GT-3') of SEQ ID NO. 2, designed as described by Hue et al. [\nHue, F.X., M.Huerre, M.A. Rouffault, and C.D. Bievre. Specified detection of Fusarium species in blood and tissues by a PCR technique. Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 37: 2434-2438. 1999\n] were used for a control PCR assay. A pair of the \nFusarium\n specific primers amplified a fragment of DNA coding for the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of \nFusarium\n strains by PCR. The binding sites of the P28SL and P58SL primers, corresponding to the ITS2 region and a portion of 5.8s and 28s rDNA, are conserved among \nFusarium\n strains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor PCR, 1 ng of the DNA isolated in A was used together with a primer pair of the primers P28SL and P58SL, and a PCR pre-mixture purchased from Promega. Starting by denaturation at 94Â°C for 10 min, PCR was performed with 40 cycles of denaturation at 94Â°C for 1 min, annealing at 60Â°C for 1 min and extension at 72Â°C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72Â°C for 10 min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PCR product thus obtained was run on a 2% agarose gel in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer in the presence of an electric field. After completion of the electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PCR product (F) amplified from \nFusarium\n stains was detected at a position between 300 and 400 bp, which matched with the sizes of PCR products from two controls \nFusarium moniliforme\n NRRL 13569 and \nFusarium oxysporum\n KCTC 16909 (\nFIG. 5\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PCR product obtained with the Fusarium-specific primers was purified and sequenced commercially (Macrogen Inc. Seoul, Korea). BLAST search for homology in the GenBank database showed that the ITS-5.8 8 rDNA sequence of the \nFusarium\n strain of the present invention shared more than 98% homology with those of F. \nsolani\n (\nFIG. 6\n). The ITS-5.8 rDNA sequence of the \nFusarium\n strain is given in SEQ ID NO. 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis \nFusarium\n strain was named \nFusarium solani\n KCCM90040 and deposited with the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms on Jan. 15, 2008 with accession No. KCCM10881P, according to the Budapest Treaty.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 2: Production and Separation of Cyclic Depsipeptide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) Cultivation in Fusarium Defined Medium\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[94] Fusarium solani\n KCCM90040 was inoculated at a density of 1 Ã 10\n5\n spores/mL into 100 mL of a \nFusarium\n defined medium (FDM) broth (25 g of sucrose, 4.25 g of NaNO\n3\n, 5 g of NaCl, 2.5 g of MgSO\n4\n7H2O, 1.36 g of KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 0.01 g of FeSO\n4\n7H2O, and 0.0029 g of ZnSO\n4\n7H2O per liter) and incubated at 25Â°C for 7 days.\n\n\n \n\n\n(2) Cultivation on Cereal Substrate\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusarium solani\n KCCM90040 was inoculated at a density of 1 Ã 10\n5\n spores/mL to a rice medium which was prepared from 50 g of autoclaved rice with the water content thereof adjusted to 40 wt% with sterile distilled water, followed by culturing at 25Â°C for 7 days.\n\n\n \n\n\n(3) Extraction of Cyclic Depsipeptide from the Culture\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo the \nFusarium\n strain culture including the mycelia of (1) was added two volumes of chloroform. It was vigorously stirred and the bottom layer was evaporated to dryness. The residue was resuspended in methanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cereal medium in which the \nFusarium\n of (2) was cultured was dried at room temperature for 12 hrs. The mycelia thus dried were homogenized, extracted overnight with 75 ml of a solvent mixture of 16:3:1 (v/v/v) acetonitrile: MeOH: water, and filtered through sterile filter paper. The filtrate was defatted twice with 25 mL of n-heptane and the bottom layer was evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in 50 mL of a solvent mixture of 55:45 (v/v) MeOH: water and extracted twice with 25 mL of CH\n2\nCl\n2\n. The CH\n2\nCl\n2\n layer was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was resuspended in methanol.\n\n\n \n\n\n(4) Purification of Cyclic Depsipeptide from the Extracts\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEach of the extracts from the cultures of (1) and (2) was flowed for 40 min at a constant flow rate (1 mL/min) along a Shiseido pack C18 column (0.46 Ã 25 cm) (Shiseido co., Japan) with a mixture of 70:30 (v/v) acetonitrile: water serving as an eluent. Peaks were read at 210 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNo secondary metabolites were detected in the extract of the culture in FDM of (1) (\nFIG. 7\n). On the other hand, two main peaks could be eluted with a retention time of 9.7 and 13.4 minutes from the extract from the culture on the cereal substance of (2) (\nFIG. 8\n). The compounds detected at 9.7 and 13.4 min were named Compound A and B, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds were separated using a GROM-sil pack ODS preparative column (1.0 Ã 25 cm) with a mixture of acetonitrile: water solution (65:35, v/v) serving as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 3 ml/min for 60 min, followed by further purification through a Shiseido pack C18 column (0.46 Ã 25 cm) with a mixture of acetonitrile: water (70: 30, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.\n\n\n \n\n\n(5) Determination of Molecular Weight\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds A and B were found to have molecular weights of 586.36 and 600.36 m/z, respectively, as measured by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (\nFIGS. 9\n and \n10\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese mass data of the secondary metabolites (Compounds A and B) were very similar to previously reported ones for cyclic depsipeptides.

Ceuto et al. (2000) reported that N-Methylsansalvamide exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity in the NCI human tumor cell line screen (GI\n50\n 8.3 ÂµM) [Ceuto et al., 2000]. As is apparent from the data of Tables 4 and 5, the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 exhibit cytotoxicity against most cell lines as potent as that of sansalvamide A or N-methylsansalvamide irrespective of the possession of multidrug resistance. The cyclic pentadepsipeptide of \nChemical Formula\n 1 was of more potent inhibitory activity against MDR cancer lines than was that of Chemical Formula 2 (\nFIGS. 17 to 20\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 5: Multidrug Resistance-Reversing Activity\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 were analyzed for MDR-reversing activity by comparing inhibitory activities against multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines (MES-SA/DX5 and HCT15/CL02) with those against non-multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines (MES-SA and HCT15). In this regard, the effects of the cyclic pentadepsipeptides of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 on paclitaxel's cytotoxicity against MDR tumor cells were measured (Table 6).

On the other hand, the cyclic pentadepsipeptide of \nChemical Formula\n 1 remarkably enhanced the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel (\nFIGS. 21 to 24\n). Therefore, the N-methyl group in the cyclic pentadepsipeptide may be a factor crucial for the expression of the MDR reversal activity. The MDR-reversing activity of the cyclic pentadepsipeptide of \nChemical Compound\n 1 was similar to that of the positive control verapamil.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 6: Anti-Bacterial and Anti-Fungal Activities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) Anti-Bacterial Activity\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAssays for antibacterial activity were performed with 3 Gram-positive \n(Listeria monocytogenes\n ATCC 14028, \nStaphylococcus aureus\n ATCC 35556 and \nBacillus cereus\n ATCC 13061) and 3 Gram-negative bacteria \n(Escherichia coli\n ATCC 8739, \nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n ATCC 9026 and \nSalmonella typhimurium\n ATCC 14028). Each of the compounds of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 was dissolved in different concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 mM) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The solutions were applied to a sterile paper disc (5 mm diameter), followed by evaporating the DMSO solvent. Bacteria was inoculated at a density of 1x10\n7\n CFU/ml on Tryptic soy agar (TSA) and then, the paper disc was placed on the bacteria-inoculated agars. After incubation at 37Â°C for 24 hr, the clear zone around each disc was observed and its diameter was measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeither the compound of \nChemical Formula\n 1 nor \nChemical Formula\n 2 showed inhibitory activity against all of the bacteria tested.\n\n\n \n\n\n(2) Anti-Fungal Activity\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nInhibitory activity was performed against four fungus strains \n(Mucor rouxii, Penicillium citrinum, Fusarium oxysporum,\n and \nAspergillus oryzae).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrops of 1 and 10 mM solutions of compounds of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2 in methanol were loaded onto sterile paper discs (8 mm diameter) and the methanol solvent was evaporated under a hood. The paper discs were placed on fungus mycelia grown on potato dextrose agar. After incubation at 25Â°C for 48 hr, clear zones around the discs were observed and their diameters were measured. A filter treated with pure methanol was used as a negative control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibitory effects of compounds purified from F. \nsolani\n KCCM 90040 on the mycelial growth of four fungal strains \n(Mucor rouxii, Penicillium citrinum, Fusarium oxysporum,\n and \nAspergillus oryzae)\n are shown in \nFig. 28\n. The results of the antifungal tests revealed that \n \ncompound\n \n 1 and 2 were inhibitory against \nMucor rouxii,\n and \nFusarium oxysporum,\n weakly. No inhibitory activities were detected at 1 mM of the compound of \n \nChemical Formula\n \n 1 or 2 against all of the four fungal strains. At 10 mM of the compounds of \n \nChemical Formulas\n \n 1 and 2, no clear zones were observed on the agar in which \nMucor rouxii\n was grown, but the hyphal growth of \nMucor rouxii\n was reduced near the purified compounds containing paper disc (\nFIG. 25\n). While the compound of \nChemical Formula\n 2 did not produce a clear zone on the mycelium of \nFusarium oxysporum\n at 10 mM, the compound of \nChemical Formula\n 1 exhibited an inhibitory effect at 10 mM, weakly (\nFIG. 26\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 7: Selection of Cereal Medium\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusarium solani\n KCCM90040 was inoculated at a density of 1 x 10\n5\n spores/mL on a cereal medium which was prepared from 50 g of an autoclaved cereal substance with the water content thereof adjusted to 40 wt% with sterile distilled water.

The use of maize, wheat or Indian millet, instead of rice, decreased the productivity of the compound of \nChemical Formula\n 2 by about 80%. Particularly low production (0.112 g/kg) was observed on barley.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs for the compound of \nChemical Formula\n 1, its maximal production was obtained on the 2\nth\n week after incubation on rice (Avg. 0.689 g/kg). On the 3\nrd\n week after the incubation on wheat, its production peaked to 0.672 g/kg. Replacement of rice by maize or rye decreased the production of the compound of \nChemical Formula\n 1 by about 25%.
