Description\n\n\n\n\nThis application is a 371 National Stage Entry of PCT/JP03/14138 filed Nov. 6, 2003, which claims the benefit of JAPAN 2003-191359 filed Jul. 3, 2003, JAPAN 2003-59073 filed Mar. 5, 2003, JAPAN 2002-367119 filed Dec. 18, 2002 and JAPAN 2002-324189, filed Nov. 7, 2002.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a novel intrinsic ligand for FPRL1, the G protein-coupled receptor protein, and use thereof.\n\n\nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\nPhysiologically active substances such as various hormones and neurotransmitters regulate the biological function via specific receptor proteins present on cell membranes. Many of these receptor proteins are coupled with guanine nucleotide-binding protein (hereinafter sometimes simply referred to as G protein) and mediate the intracellular signal transduction via activation of G protein. These receptor proteins possess the common structure containing seven transmembrane domains and are thus collectively referred to as G protein-coupled receptors or seven-transmembrane receptors (7TMR).\n\n\nG protein-coupled receptor proteins present on the cell surface of each functional cell and organ in the body, and play important physiological roles as the target of the molecules that regulate the functions of the cells and organs, e.g., hormones, neurotransmitters, physiologically active substances and the like. Receptor proteins transmit signals to cells via binding with physiologically active substances, and the signals induce various reactions such as activation and inhibition of the cells.\n\n\nTo clarify the relationship between substances that regulate complex functions in various cells and organs, and their specific receptor proteins, in particular, G protein-coupled receptor proteins, would elucidate the functional mechanisms in various cells and organs in the body to provide a very important means for development of drugs closely associated with the functions.\n\n\nFor example, in various organs, their physiological functions are controlled in vivo through regulation by many hormones, hormone-like substances, neurotransmitters or physiologically active substances. In particular, physiologically active substances are found in numerous sites of the body and regulate the physiological functions through their corresponding receptor proteins. It is supposed that many unknown hormones, neurotransmitters or many other physiologically active substances still exist in the body, and many of structures of the receptor proteins have not yet been reported. In addition, it is still unknown if there are subtypes of known receptor proteins.\n\n\nIt is very important for development of drugs to clarify the relationship between substances that regulate elaborated functions in vivo and their specific receptor proteins. For efficient screening of agonists and antagonists to receptor proteins in development of drugs, it is required to clarify functional mechanisms of receptor protein genes expressed in vivo and express the genes in an appropriate expression system.\n\n\nIn recent years, random analysis of cDNA sequences has been actively studied as a means for analyzing genes expressed in vivo. The sequences of cDNA fragments thus obtained have been registered on and published to databases as Expressed Sequence Tag (EST). However, since many ESTs contain sequence information only, it is difficult to predict their functions from the information.\n\n\nAs one of G protein-coupled receptor proteins, FPRL1s such as human FPRL1 (J. Biol. Chem. 267(11), 7637-7643 (1992)) and mouse FPRL2 (J. Immunol. 169, 3363-3369 (2002)) are known.\n\n\nAgonists of FPRL1 which have been reported include bacterium-derived FMLF, a partial peptide of HIV-derived gp41 or gp120, a partial peptide of prion, intrinsic substances such as Aβ42, a partial peptide of Annexin I and partial peptides of acute phase protein, hCAP18 and NADH dehydrogenase, and lipoxin A4 as lipid (Int. Immunopharmacol. 2, 1-13, 2002).\n\n\nIn addition, it has been reported that FPRL1 (lipoxin A\n4 \nreceptor protein) contributes to anti-inflammatory effects (Nature Medicine, 2002 November: 8(11): 1296-1302.) It has been reported that Aβ42 is fibrous as a consequence of binding to monocyte- or microglia-derived FPRL1 and uptake (Journal of Leukocyte Biology, Vol. 72, 628, (2002).)\n\n\nIt has been reported that N-terminus of mitochondrial protein is a chemotactic factor of polymorphonuclear leukocyte, and the mitochondrial protein released from injured cells causes inflammation (Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1995 Jun 26: 211 (3): 812-818.)\n\n\nMitochondrial protein (NADH dehydrogenase), wherein N-terminus thereof is formylated, is reported to be a chemotactic factor of neutrophil (J Exp Med. 1982 Jan 1: 155 (1): 264-275.)\n\n\nThe present invention intends to provide a novel intrinsic ligand for FPRL1, the G protein-coupled receptor protein, a method for screening a compound or a salt thereof that alters binding property between the ligand and FPRL1 (antagonist and agonist) and the like.\n\n\nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nAs a result of extensive investigations, the present inventors have succeeded at isolation and purification of a novel intrinsic ligand, which can bind to FPRL1, from stomach extracts of swine. In addition, they have succeeded at cloning of the DNA encoding rat-derived novel FPRL1. Based on these findings, the present inventors have continued further extensive studies and as a result, have come to accomplish the present invention.\n\n\nThat is, the present invention provides:\n\n \n \n[1] A peptide consisting of the same or substantially the same amino acid sequence as the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO: 21, its amide or ester, or

At the end of the reaction, the protein is excised from the resin and at the same time, the protecting groups are removed. Then, intramolecular disulfide bond-forming reaction is performed in a highly diluted solution to obtain the objective protein or its amides.\n\n\nFor condensation of the protected amino acids described above, a variety of activation reagents for protein synthesis may be used, and carbodiimides are particularly preferable. Examples of such carbodiimides include DCC, N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide, N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, and the like. For activation by these reagents, the protected amino acids in combination with a racemization inhibitor (e.g., HOBt, HOOBt) are added directly to the resin, or the protected amino acids are previously activated in the form of symmetric acid anhydrides, HOBt esters or HOOBt esters, followed by adding the thus activated protected amino acids to the resin.\n\n\nSolvents used to activate the protected amino acids or condense with the resin may be chosen from solvents known to be usable for protein condensation reactions. Examples of such solvents are acid amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, and N-methylpyrrolidone; halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride and chloroform; alcohols such as trifluoroethanol; sulfoxides such as dimethylsulfoxide; ethers such as pyridine, dioxane and tetrahydrofuran; nitrites such as acetonitrile and propionitrile; esters such as methyl acetate and ethyl acetate; and appropriate mixtures of these solvents. The reaction temperature is appropriately chosen from the range known to be applicable to protein binding reactions and is usually selected in the range of approximately −20° C. to 50° C. The activated amino acid derivatives are used generally in an excess of 1.5 to 4 times. The condensation is examined by a test using the ninhydrin reaction; when the condensation is insufficient, the condensation can be completed by repeating the condensation reaction without removal of the protecting groups. When the condensation is yet insufficient even after repeating the reaction, unreacted amino acids are acetylated with acetic anhydride or acetylimidazole.\n\n\nExamples of the protecting groups used to protect the amino groups of the starting compounds include Z, Boc, t-pentyloxycarbonyl, isobornyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, Cl-Z, Br-Z, adamantyloxycarbonyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthaloyl, formyl, 2-nitrophenylsulphenyl, diphenylphosphinothioyl, Fmoc, and the like.\n\n\nA carboxyl group can be protected by, e.g., alkyl esterification (in the form of linear, branched or cyclic alkyl esters of the alkyl moiety such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, tertiary butyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, 2-adamantyl, etc.), aralkyl esterification (e.g., esterification in the form of benzyl ester, 4-nitrobenzyl ester, 4-methoxybenzyl ester, 4-chlorobenzyl ester, benzhydryl ester, etc.), phenacyl esterification, benzyloxycarbonyl hydrazidation, tertiary butoxycarbonyl hydrazidation, trityl hydrazidation, or the like.\n\n\nThe hydroxyl group of serine can be protected through, for example, its esterification or etherification. Examples of groups appropriately used for the esterification include a lower alkanoyl group, such as acetyl group, an aroyl group such as benzoyl group, and a group derived from carbonic acid such as benzyloxycarbonyl group, ethoxycarbonyl group, etc. Examples of a group appropriately used for the etherification include benzyl group, tetrahydropyranyl group, t-butyl group, or the like Examples of groups for protecting the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine include Bzl, Cl\n2\n-Bzl, 2-nitrobenzyl, Br-Z, tertiary butyl, or the like.\n\n\nExamples of groups used to protect the imidazole moiety of histidine include Tos, 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonyl, DNP, benzyloxymethyl, Bum, Boc, Trt, Fmoc, or the like.\n\n\nExamples of the activated carboxyl groups in the starting compounds include the corresponding acid anhydrides, azides, activated esters (esters with alcohols (e.g., pentachlorophenol, 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, cyanomethyl alcohol, p-nitrophenol, HONB, N-hydroxysuccimide, N-hydroxyphthalimide, HOBt)). As the activated amino acids in which the amino groups are activated in the starting material, the corresponding phosphoric amides are employed.\n\n\nTo eliminate (split off) the protecting groups, there are used catalytic reduction under hydrogen gas flow in the presence of a catalyst such as Pd-black or Pd-carbon; an acid treatment with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, methanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethane-sulfonic acid or trifluoroacetic acid, or a mixture solution of these acids; a treatment with a base such as diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, piperidine or piperazine; and reduction with sodium in liquid ammonia. The elimination of the protecting group by the acid treatment described above is carried out generally at a temperature of approximately −20° C. to 40° C. In the acid treatment, it is efficient to add a cation scavenger such as anisole, phenol, thioanisole, m-cresol, p-cresol, dimethylsulfide, 1,4-butanedithiol or 1,2-ethanedithiol. Furthermore, 2,4-dinitrophenyl group known as a protecting group for the imidazole of histidine is removed by a treatment with thiophenol. Formyl group used as a protecting group of the indole of tryptophan is eliminated by the aforesaid acid treatment in the presence of 1,2-ethanedithiol or 1,4-butanedithiol, as well as by a treatment with an alkali such as a dilute sodium hydroxide solution and dilute ammonia.\n\n\nProtection of functional groups that should not be involved in the reaction of the starting materials, protecting groups, elimination of the protecting groups and activation of functional groups involved in the reaction can be appropriately selected from publicly known groups and publicly known means.\n\n\nIn an alternative method for obtaining the amides of the protein, for example, the α-carboxyl group of the carboxy terminal amino acid is first protected by amidation, and the peptide (protein) chain is then extended from the amino group side to a desired length. Thereafter, a protein in which only the protecting group of the N-terminal α-amino group in the peptide chain has been eliminated from the protein, and a protein in which only the protecting group of the C-terminal carboxyl group has been eliminated are prepared. The two proteins are condensed in a mixture of the solvents described above. The details of the condensation reaction are the same as described above. After the protected protein obtained by the condensation is purified, all the protecting groups can be eliminated by the method described above to give the desired crude protein. This crude protein is purified by various known purification means, followed by lyophilization of the major fraction, to give the amide of the desired protein.\n\n\nTo prepare the ester of the protein, for example, the α-carboxyl group of the carboxy terminal amino acid is condensed with a desired alcohol to prepare the amino acid ester, which is followed by procedure similar to the preparation of the amidated protein above to give the ester form of the desired protein.\n\n\nThe partial peptide of FPRL1 of the present invention or salts thereof can be manufactured by publicly known methods for peptide synthesis, or by cleaving FPRL1 of the present invention with an appropriate peptidase. For the methods for peptide synthesis, for example, either solid phase synthesis or liquid phase synthesis may be used. That is, the partial peptide or amino acids that can construct FPRL1 of the present invention are condensed with the remaining part. Where the product has protecting groups, these protecting groups can be removed to give the desired peptide. Publicly known methods for condensation and elimination of the protecting groups are described in (a) to (e) below:\n\n \n \n(a) M. Bodanszky & M. A.

Such a polynucleotide may also be any one of DNA encoding FPRL1 of the present invention, RNA such as mRNA, etc., and may be double-stranded or single-stranded. Where the polynucleotide is double-stranded, it may be double-stranded DNA, double-stranded RNA or DNA:RNA hybrid. Where the polynucleotide is single-stranded, it may be a sense strand (i.e., a coding strand) or an antisense strand (i.e., a non-coding strand).\n\n\nUsing the polynucleotide encoding FPRL1 of the present invention, mRNA of FPRL1 of the present invention can be quantified by, for example, the publicly known method published in separate volume of Jikken Igaku 15 (7) “New PCR and its application” (1997), or by its modifications.\n\n\nThe DNA encoding FPRL1 of the present invention may be any of genomic DNA, genomic DNA library, cDNA derived from the cells and tissues described above, cDNA library derived from the cells and tissues described above, and synthetic DNA.

The DNA may also be directly amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (hereinafter abbreviated as RT-PCR) using the total RNA or mRNA fraction prepared from the cells and tissues described above.\n\n\nSpecifically, the DNA encoding human FPRL1 of the present invention may be, for example, DNA comprising the base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 3, or DNA having a base sequence hybridizable to the base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 3, under highly stringent conditions and encoding a receptor protein having the activities substantially equivalent to those (e.g., a ligand binding activity, a signal transduction activity, etc.) of human FPRL1 consisting of the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 2.\n\n\nSpecifically, the DNA encoding rat FPRL1 of the present invention may be, for example, DNA comprising the base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 5, or DNA having a base sequence hybridizable to the base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 5, under highly stringent conditions and encoding a receptor protein having the activities substantially equivalent to those (e.g., a ligand binding activity, a signal transduction activity, etc.) of rat FPRL1 consisting of the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 4.\n\n\nSpecifically, the DNA encoding mouse FPRL2 of the present invention may be, for example, DNA comprising the base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 7, or DNA having a base sequence hybridizable to the base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 7, under highly stringent conditions and encoding a receptor protein having the activities substantially equivalent to those (e.g., a ligand binding activity, a signal transduction activity, etc.) of mouse FPRL2 consisting of the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 6.\n\n\nSpecific examples of the DNA hybridizable to the base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 5 or SEQ ID NO: 7 include, for example, DNA comprising a base sequence having at least about 85% homology, preferably at least about 90% homology and more preferably at least about 95% homology to the base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 5 or SEQ ID NO: 7.\n\n\nThe homology among the base sequences can be calculated using homology calculation algorism NCBI BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) under the following conditions: expected value=10; gap is allowable; filtering=ON; match score=1; mismatch score=−3 .\n\n\nThe hybridization can be carried out by publicly known methods or by modifications of these methods, for example, according to the method described in Molecular Cloning, 2nd (J. Sambrook et al., Cold Spring Harbor Lab. Press, 1989). A commercially available library may also be used according to the instructions of the attached manufacturer's protocol. Preferably, the hybridization can be carried out under highly stringent conditions.\n\n\nThe highly stringent conditions used herein are, for example, those in a sodium concentration at about 19 mM to about 40 mM, preferably about 19 mM to about 20 mM at a temperature of about 50° C. to about 70° C., preferably about 60° C. to about 65° C. In particular, hybridization conditions in a sodium concentration of about 19 mM at a temperature of about 65° C. are most preferred.\n\n\nMore specifically, DNA consisting of the base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 3 or the like is used as the DNA encoding human FPRL1 consisting of the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 2.\n\n\nDNA consisting of the base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 5 or the like is used as the DNA encoding rat FPRL1 consisting of the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 4.\n\n\nDNA comprising the base sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 7 or the like is used as the DNA encoding mouse FPRL2 consisting of the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 6.\n\n\nThe polynucleotide comprising a part of the base sequence of the DNA encoding FPRL1 of the present invention or a part of the base sequence complementary to the DNA is used to refer to not only the DNA encoding the partial peptide of the present invention described below but also to RNA.\n\n\nAccording to the present invention, the antisense polynucleotide (nucleic acid) that can inhibit replication or expression of the FPRL1 gene can be designed and synthesized based on the base sequence information of the cloned or determined DNA encoding FPRL1. Such a polynucleotide (nucleic acid) is hybridizable with RNA of the FPRL1 gene to inhibit the synthesis or function of the RNA or is capable of modulating/controlling the expression of the FPRL1 gene via interaction with RNA associated with FPRL1. Polynucleotides complementary to the selected sequences of RNA associated with FPRL1 and polynucleotides specifically hybridizable to RNA associated with FPRL1 are useful in modulating/controlling the in vivo and in vitro expression of the FPRL1 gene, and are useful for the treatment or diagnosis of diseases, and the like. The term “corresponding” is used to refer to homologous to or complementary to a particular sequence of the nucleotide including the gene, base sequence or nucleic acid. The term “corresponding” between nucleotides, base sequences or nucleic acids and peptides (proteins) usually refer to amino acids of a peptide (protein) under the order derived from the sequence of nucleotides (nucleic acids) or their complements. In the FPRL1 gene, the 5′ end hairpin loop, 5′ end 6-base-pair repeats, 5′ end untranslated region, polypeptide translation initiation codon, protein coding region, ORF translation termination codon, 3′ end untranslated region, 3′ end palindrome region, and 3′ end hairpin loop, may be selected as preferred target regions, though any other region in the FPRL1 gene may be selected as a target.\n\n\nThe relationship between the target nucleic acids and the polynucleotides complementary to, and hybridizable to, at least a part of the target region, can be denoted to be “antisense” to the polynucleotides in the target region. Examples of the antisense polynucleotides include polydeoxyribonucleotides containing 2-deoxy-D-ribose, polyribonucleotides containing D-ribose, any other type of polynucleotides which are N-glycosides of a purine or pyrimidine base, or other polymers containing non-nucleotide backbones (e.g., commercially available protein nucleic acids and synthetic sequence-specific nucleic acid polymers) or other polymers containing nonstandard linkages (provided that the polymers contain nucleotides having such a configuration that allows base pairing or base stacking, as is found in DNA or RNA), etc. The antisense polynucleotide may be double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, double-stranded RNA, single-stranded RNA or a DNA:RNA hybrid, and may further include unmodified polynucleotides (or unmodified oligonucleotides), those with publicly known types of modifications, for example, those with labels known in the art, those with caps, methylated polynucleotides, those with substitution of one or more naturally occurring nucleotides by their analogue, those with intramolecular modifications of nucleotides such as those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoramidates, carbamates, etc.) and those with charged linkages or sulfur-containing linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those having side chain groups such as proteins (nucleases, nuclease inhibitors, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, poly-L-lysine, etc.), saccharides (e.g., monosaccharides, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylating agents, those with modified linkages (e.g., a anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), and the like. Herein the terms “nucleoside”, “nucleotide” and “nucleic acid” are used to refer to moieties that contain not only the purine and pyrimidine bases, but also other heterocyclic bases, which have been modified. Such modifications may include methylated purines and pyrimidines, acylated purines and pyrimidines and other heterocyclic rings. Modified nucleotides and modified nucleotides also include modifications on the sugar moiety, wherein, for example, one or more hydroxyl groups may optionally be substituted with a halogen atom(s), an aliphatic group(s), etc., or may be converted into the corresponding functional groups such as ethers, amines, or the like.\n\n\nThe antisense polynucleotide (nucleic acid) of the present invention is RNA, DNA or a modified nucleic acid (RNA, DNA). Specific examples of the modified nucleic acid include, but are not limited to, sulfur and thiophosphate derivatives of nucleic acids and those resistant to degradation of polynucleoside amides or oligonucleoside amides. The antisense nucleic acids of the present invention can be modified preferably based on the following design, that is, by increasing the intracellular stability of the antisense nucleic acid, increasing the cell permeability of the antisense nucleic acid, increasing the affinity of the nucleic acid to the targeted sense strand to a higher level, or minimizing the toxicity, if any, of the antisense nucleic acid.\n\n\nMany of such modifications are known in the art, as disclosed in J. Kawakami, et al., Pharm. Tech. Japan, Vol. 8, p. 247, 1992; Vol. 8, p. 395, 1992; S. T. Crooke, et al. ed., Antisense Research and Applications, CRC Press, 1993; etc.\n\n\nThe antisense nucleic acids of the present invention may contain altered or modified sugars, bases or linkages, may also be provided in a specialized form such as liposomes or microspheres, may be applied to gene therapy, or may be provided in combination with attached moieties. Such attached moieties include polycations such as polylysine that act as charge neutralizers of the phosphate backbone, or hydrophobic moieties such as lipids (e.g., phospholipids, cholesterols, etc.) that enhance the interaction with cell membranes or increase uptake of the nucleic acid. Preferred examples of the lipids to be attached are cholesterols or derivatives thereof (e.g., cholesteryl chloroformate, cholic acid, etc.). These moieties may be attached to the polynucleotide at the 3′ or 5′ ends thereof and may also be attached thereto through a base, sugar, or intramolecular nucleoside linkage. Other groups may be capping groups specifically placed at the 3′ or 5′ ends of the nucleic acid to prevent degradation by nucleases such as exonuclease, RNase, etc. Such capping groups include, but are not limited to, hydroxyl protecting groups known in the art, including glycols such as polyethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol and the like.\n\n\nThe inhibitory activity of the antisense nucleic acid can be examined using the transformant of the present invention, the gene expression system of the present invention in vivo and in vitro, or a translation system of G protein conjugated receptor protein in vivo and in vitro. The nucleic acid itself can be applied to cells by a variety of publicly known methods.\n\n\nThe siRNA to the polynucleotide of the present invention is a double-stranded RNA comprising a part of the RNA encoding FPRL1 and its complementary RNA.\n\n\nThe siRNA can be designed based on the sequence of the polynucleotide of the present invention and manufactured by modifications of publicly known methods (e.g., Nature, 411, 494-498, 2001).\n\n\nThe ribozyme containing a part of the RNA encoding FPRL1 can be designed based on the sequence of the polynucleotide of the present invention and manufactured by modifications of publicly known methods (e.g., Alfred S. Lewin and William W. Hauswirth, TRENDS in Molecular Medicine, \nVolume\n 7, \nIssue\n 5, Pages 221-228, 2001). For example, it can be manufactured by replacing a part of ribozyme publicly known with a part of the RNA encoding FPRL1. The part of RNA encoding FPRL1 includes a portion in the vicinity of the consensus sequence NUX (wherein N represents all bases and X represents a base other than G), which may be cleaved with by ribozyme publicly known.\n\n\nThe DNA encoding the partial peptide of the present invention may be any DNA insofar as it comprises the base sequence encoding the partial peptide of the present invention described above. The DNA may be any of genomic DNA, genomic DNA library, cDNA derived from the cells and tissues described above, cDNA library derived from the cells and tissues described above, and synthetic DNA.

The hybridization can be carried out, for example, according to the method described in Molecular Cloning, 2nd, J. Sambrook et al., Cold Spring Harbor Lab. Press, 1989. The hybridization may also be performed using commercially available library in accordance with the protocol described in the attached instructions.\n\n\nConversion of the base sequence of the DNA can be effected by publicly known methods such as the ODA-LA PCR method, the gapped duplex method or the Kunkel method or its modification by using PCR or a publicly known kit available as Mutan™-super Express Km (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) or Mutan™-K (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.).\n\n\nThe cloned DNA encoding FPRL1 can be used as it is, depending upon purpose or if desired after digestion with a restriction enzyme or after addition of a linker thereto. The DNA may have ATG as a translation initiation codon at the 5′ end thereof and may further have TAA, TGA or TAG as a translation termination codon at the 3′ end thereof. These translation initiation and termination codons may also be added by using an appropriate synthetic DNA adapter.\n\n\nThe expression vector for FPRL1 of the present invention can be manufactured, for example, by (a) excising the desired DNA fragment from the DNA encoding FPRL1 of the present invention, and then (b) ligating the DNA fragment with an appropriate expression vector downstream from a promoter in the vector.\n\n\nExamples of the vector include plasmids derived form \nE. coli \n(e.g., pBR322, pBR325, pUC12, pUC13), plasmids derived from Bacillus subtilis (e.g., pUB110, pTP5, pC194), plasmids derived from yeast (e.g., pSH19, pSH15), bacteriophages such as λ phage, etc., animal viruses such as retrovirus, vaccinia virus, baculovirus, etc. as well as pA1-11, pXT1, pRc/CMV, pRc/RSV, pcDNAI/Neo, and the like.\n\n\nThe promoter used in the present invention may be any promoter if it matches well with a host to be used for gene expression.

U.S.A., 75, 1929 (1978), etc.\n\n\nInsect cells or insects can be transformed, for example, according to the method described in Bio/Technology, 6, 47-55 (1988), etc.\n\n\nAnimal cells can be transformed, for example, according to the method described in Saibo Kogaku (Cell Engineering), \nextra issue\n 8, Shin Saibo Kogaku Jikken Protocol (New Cell Engineering Experimental Protocol), 263-267 (1995), published by Shujunsha, or Virology, 52, 456 (1973).\n\n\nThus, the transformant transformed with the expression vector comprising the DNA encoding FPRL1 can be obtained.\n\n\nWhere the host is bacteria belonging to the genus \nEscherichia \nor the genus \nBacillus\n, the transformant can be appropriately incubated in a liquid medium which contains materials required for growth of the transformant such as carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inorganic materials, and so on. Examples of the carbon sources include glucose, dextrin, soluble starch, sucrose, etc. Examples of the nitrogen sources include inorganic or organic materials such as ammonium salts, nitrate salts, corn steep liquor, peptone, casein, meat extract, soybean cake, potato extract, etc. Examples of the inorganic materials are calcium chloride, sodium dihydrogenphosphate, magnesium chloride, etc. In addition, yeast extract, vitamins, growth promoting factors etc. may also be added to the medium. Preferably, pH of the medium is adjusted to about 5 to about 8.\n\n\nA preferred example of the medium for incubation of the bacteria belonging to the genus \nEscherichia \nis M9 medium supplemented with glucose and Casamino acids (Miller, Journal of Experiments in Molecular Genetics, 431-433, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York, 1972). If necessary and desired, a chemical such as 3β-indolylacrylic acid can be added to the medium to activate the promoter efficiently.\n\n\nWhere the bacteria belonging to the genus \nEscherichia \nare used as the host, the transformant is usually cultivated at about 15° C. to about 43° C. for about 3 hours to about 24 hours. If necessary and desired, the culture may be aerated or agitated.\n\n\nWhere the bacteria belonging to the genus \nBacillus \nare used as the host, the transformant is cultivated generally at about 30° C. to about 40° C. for about 6 hours to about 24 hours. If necessary and desired, the culture can be aerated or agitated.\n\n\nWhere yeast is used as the host, the transformant is cultivated, for example, in Burkholder's minimal medium (Bostian, K. L. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 77, 4505 (1980)) or in SD medium supplemented with 0.5% Casamino acids (Bitter, G. A. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 81, 5330 (1984)). Preferably, pH of the medium is adjusted to about 5 to about 8. In general, the transformant is cultivated at about 20° C. to about 35° C. for about 24 hours to about 72 hours. If necessary and desired, the culture can be aerated or agitated.\n\n\nWhere insect cells or insects are used as the host, the transformant is cultivated in, for example, Grace's Insect Medium (Grace, T. C. C., Nature, 195, 788 (1962)) to which an appropriate additive such as inactivated 10% bovine serum is added. Preferably, pH of the medium is adjusted to about 6.2 to about 6.4. Normally, the transformant is cultivated at about 27° C. for about 3 days to about 5 days and, if necessary and desired, the culture can be aerated or agitated.\n\n\nWhere animal cells are employed as the host, the transformant is cultivated in, for example, MEM medium containing about 5% to about 20% fetal bovine serum (Science, 122, 501 (1952)), DMEM medium (Virology, 8, 396 (1959)), RPMI 1640 medium (The Journal of the American Medical Association, 199, 519 (1967)), 199 medium (Proceeding of the Society for the Biological Medicine, 73, 1 (1950)), etc. Preferably, pH of the medium is adjusted to about 6 to about 8. The transformant is usually cultivated at about 30° C. to about 40° C. for about 15 hours to about 60 hours and, if necessary and desired, the culture can be aerated or agitated.\n\n\nAs described above, FPRL1 of the present invention can be produced in the cell, in the cell membrane or out of the cell of the transformant.\n\n\nFPRL1 of the present invention can be separated and purified from the culture described above by the following procedures.\n\n\nWhen FPRL1 of the present invention is extracted from the culture or cells after cultivation, the transformants or cells are collected by a publicly known method and suspended in an appropriate buffer. The transformants or cells are then disrupted by publicly known methods such as ultrasonication, treatment with lysozyme and/or freeze-thaw cycling, followed by centrifugation, filtration, etc. Thus, the crude extract of FPRL1 of the present invention can be obtained. The buffer used for the procedures may contain a protein modifier such as urea or guanidine hydrochloride, or a surfactant such as Triton X-100™, etc. When FPRL1 is secreted in the culture, the supernatant after completion of the cultivation can be separated from the transformants or cells to collect the supernatant by a publicly known method.\n\n\nFPRL1 contained in the supernatant or the extract thus obtained can be purified by appropriately combining the publicly known methods for separation and purification. Such publicly known methods for separation and purification include a method utilizing difference in solubility such as salting out, solvent precipitation, etc.; a method utilizing mainly difference in molecular weight such as dialysis, ultrafiltration, gel filtration, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, etc.; a method utilizing difference in electric charge such as ion exchange chromatography, etc.; a method utilizing difference in specific affinity such as affinity chromatography, etc.; a method utilizing difference in hydrophobicity such as reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, etc.; a method utilizing difference in isoelectric point such as isoelectrofocusing electrophoresis; and the like.\n\n\nWhen FPRL1 thus obtained is in a free form, it can be converted into the salt by publicly known methods or modifications thereof. On the other hand, when FPRL1 is obtained in the form of a salt, it can be converted into the free form or in the form of a different salt by publicly known methods or modifications thereof.\n\n\nFPRL1 produced by the recombinant can be treated, prior to or after the purification, with an appropriate protein-modifying enzyme so that FPRL1 can be appropriately modified to partially remove a polypeptide. Examples of the protein-modifying enzyme include trypsin, chymotrypsin, arginyl endopeptidase, protein kinase, glycosidase or the like.\n\n\nThe activity of the thus produced FPRL1 of the present invention or salts thereof can be determined by a test binding to a labeled ligand (FPRL1 ligand), by an enzyme immunoassay using a specific antibody, or the like.\n\n\nAntibodies against FPRL1 of the present invention may be any of polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies as long as they are capable of recognizing FPRL1 of the present invention.\n\n\nThe antibodies against FPRL1 of the present invention may be manufactured by publicly known methods for manufacturing antibodies or antisera, using as antigens FPRL1 of the present invention.\n\n\n[Preparation of Monoclonal Antibody]\n\n\n(a) Preparation of Monoclonal Antibody-Producing Cells\n\n\nFPRL1 of the present invention is administered to mammals either solely or together with carriers or diluents to the site where the production of antibody is possible by the administration. In order to potentiate the antibody productivity upon the administration, complete Freund's adjuvants or incomplete Freund's adjuvants may be administered. The administration is usually carried out once in every two to six weeks and 2 to 10 times in total. Examples of the mammals used are monkeys, rabbits, dogs, guinea pigs, mice, rats, sheep and goats, with mice and rats being preferred.\n\n\nIn the preparation of monoclonal antibody-producing cells, warm-blooded animals, e.g., mice, immunized with an antigen wherein the antibody titer is noted are selected, then the spleen or lymph node is collected after 2 to 5 days from the final immunization and antibody-producing cells contained therein are fused with myeloma cells from an animal of the same or different species to give monoclonal antibody-producing hybridomas. Measurement of the antibody titer in antisera may be made, for example, by reacting a labeled form of the receptor protein, which will be described later, with the antiserum followed by assaying the binding activity of the labeling agent bound to the antibody. The fusion may be operated, for example, by the known Kohler, and Milstein method (Nature, 256, 495-497, 1975). Examples of the fusion accelerator are polyethylene glycol (PEG), Sendai virus, etc., among which PEG is preferably employed.\n\n\nExamples of the myeloma cells used include NS-1, P3U1, SP2/0 etc., among which P3U1 is preferably employed. A preferred ratio of the count of the antibody-producing cells used (spleen cells) to the count of myeloma cells is within a range of approximately 1:1 to 20:1. When PEG (preferably, \nPEG\n 1000 to PEG 6000) is added in a concentration of approximately 10 to 80% followed by incubation at about 20° C. to about 40° C., preferably at about 30° C. to about 37° C. for about 1 to about 10 minutes, efficient cell fusion can be carried out.\n\n\nVarious methods can be used for screening of a monoclonal antibody-producing hybridoma. Examples of such methods include a method which comprises adding the supernatant of hybridoma to a solid phase (e.g., microplate) adsorbed with the receptor protein as an antigen directly or together with a carrier, adding an anti-immunoglobulin antibody (when mouse cells are used for the cell fusion, anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody is used) labeled with a radioactive substance or an enzyme, or Protein A and detecting the monoclonal antibody bound to the solid phase, and a method which comprises adding the supernatant of hybridoma to a solid phase adsorbed with an anti-immunoglobulin antibody or Protein A, adding the receptor protein labeled with a radioactive substance or an enzyme and detecting the monoclonal antibody bound to the solid phase.\n\n\nThe monoclonal antibody can be selected by publicly known methods or by modifications of these methods. In general, the selection can be effected in a medium for animal cells supplemented with HAT (hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine). Any selection and growth medium can be employed as far as the hybridoma can grow therein. For example, RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% to 20%, preferably 10% to 20% fetal bovine serum, GIT medium (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) containing 1% to 10% fetal bovine serum, a serum-free medium for cultivation of a hybridoma (SFM-101, Nissui Seiyaku Co., Ltd.) and the like can be used for the selection and growth medium. The cultivation is carried out generally at 20° C. to 40° C., preferably at about 37° C., for 5 days to 3 weeks, preferably 1 to 2 weeks. The cultivation can be conducted normally in 5% CO\n2\n. The antibody titer of the culture supernatant of hybridomas can be determined as in the assay for the antibody titer in antisera described above.\n\n\n(b) Purification of Monoclonal Antibody\n\n\nSeparation and purification of a monoclonal antibody can be carried out by methods applied to conventional separation and purification of immunoglobulins, as in the conventional methods for separation and purification of polyclonal antibodies [e.g., salting-out, alcohol precipitation, isoelectric point precipitation, electrophoresis, adsorption and desorption with ion exchangers (e.g., DEAE), ultracentrifugation, gel filtration, or a specific purification method which comprises collecting only an antibody with an activated adsorbent such as an antigen-binding solid phase, Protein A, Protein G etc. and dissociating the binding to obtain the antibody].\n\n\n[Preparation of Polyclonal Antibody]\n\n\nThe polyclonal antibody of the present invention can be manufactured by publicly known methods or modifications thereof. For example, an immunogen (antigen such as FPRL1) itself or a complex prepared from the immunogen and a carrier protein is used to immunize a mammal in a manner similar to the method described above for the manufacture of monoclonal antibodies. The product containing the antibody to FPRL1 of the present invention is collected from the immunized animal followed by separation and purification of the antibody.\n\n\nIn the complex of an immunogen and a carrier protein used to immunize a mammal, the type of carrier protein and the mixing ratio of a carrier to hapten may be any type and in any ratio, as long as the antibody is efficiently produced against the hapten immunized by crosslinking to the carrier. For example, bovine serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulins, keyhole limpet hemocyanin or the like is coupled to hapten in a carrier-to-hapten weight ratio of approximately 0.1 to 20, preferably about 1 to about 5.\n\n\nA variety of condensing agents can be used for the coupling of a carrier to hapten. Glutaraldehyde, carbodiimide, maleimide-activated ester, activated ester reagents containing thiol group or dithiopyridyl group, etc. are used for the coupling.\n\n\nThe condensation product is administered to warm-blooded animals either solely or together with carriers or diluents to the site in which the antibody can be produce by the administration. In order to potentiate the antibody productivity upon the administration, complete Freund's adjuvant or incomplete Freund's adjuvant may be administered. The administration is usually made once approximately in every 2 to 6 weeks and about 3 to about 10 times in total.\n\n\nThe polyclonal antibody can be collected from the blood, ascites, etc., preferably from the blood of mammals immunized by the method described above.\n\n\nThe polyclonal antibody titer in antiserum can be assayed by the same procedure as that for the determination of serum antibody titer described above. The separation and purification of the polyclonal antibody can be carried out according to the method for the separation and purification of immunoglobulins performed as applied to the separation and purification of monoclonal antibodies described hereinabove.\n\n\nFPRL1 ligand of the present invention is a peptide comprising the same or substantially the same amino acid sequence as the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 21 or SEQ ID NO: 23, preferably a peptide consisting of the same or substantially the same amino acid sequence as the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 21 or SEQ ID NO: 23.\n\n\nFPRL1 ligand may be any polypeptide derived from any cells (e.g., liver cells, splenocytes, nerve cells, glial cells, pancreatic β cells, bone marrow cells, mesangial cells, Langerhans' cells, epidermic cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, fibrocytes, myocytes, fat cells, immune cells (e.g., macrophage, T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, mast cells, neutrophil, basophil, eosinophil, monocyte), megakaryocyte, synovial cells, chondrocytes, bone cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, mammary gland cells or interstitial cells, the corresponding precursor cells, stem cells, cancer cells, etc.), or any tissues where such cells are present, e.g., brain or any region of the brain (e.g., olfactory bulb, amygdaloid nucleus, basal ganglia, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, medulla oblongata and cerebellum), spinal cord, hypophysis, stomach, pancreas, kidney, liver, gonad, thyroid, gall-bladder, bone marrow, adrenal gland, skin, muscle, lung, gastrointestinal tract (e.g., large intestine and small intestine), blood vessel, heart, thymus, spleen, submandibular gland, peripheral blood, prostate, testis, ovary, placenta, uterus, bone, cartilage, joint, skeletal muscle, etc. from human and non-human warm-blooded animals (e.g., guinea pigs, rats, mice, chickens, rabbits, swine, sheep, bovine, monkeys, etc.).

Insofar as the substitution, deletion, addition or insertion of amino acids does not bring about a significant change in the physiological properties or chemical properties of the polypeptide, the polypeptide subjected to such substitution, deletion, addition or insertion is substantially the same as the peptide not having such substitution, deletion, addition or insertion. Substantially equivalent substituting amino acids in the amino acid sequence can be selected from amino acids in the class to which the amino acids to be substituted belong.\n\n\nNon-polar (hydrophobic) amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine etc. Polar (neutral) amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, glutamine etc. Positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine, histidine etc. Negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid, glutamic acid etc.\n\n\nThe amino acid sequence having substantially the same amino acid sequence as the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 21 or SEQ ID NO: 23 is not particularly limited insofar as a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence has the activity (property) substantially equivalent to that of FPRL1 ligand consisting of the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 21 or SEQ ID NO: 23, and examples of the above amino acid sequence include an amino acid sequence having at least about 80% homology, preferably at least about 85% homology, more preferably at least about 90% homology, most preferably at least about 95% homology, to the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 21 or SEQ ID NO: 23.\n\n\nThe homology among the amino acid sequences can be calculated using homology calculation algorism NCBI BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) under the following conditions: expected value=10; gap is allowable; matrix=BLOSUM62; filtering=OFF.\n\n\nThe substantially equivalent activity (property) described above means that the polypeptide referred to is qualitatively equivalent to FPRL1 ligand consisting of the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 21 or SEQ ID NO: 23 in respect of physiological properties such as binding activity to FPRL1, intracellular signal transduction or anti-inflammatory action.\n\n\nMore specific examples of FPRL1 ligand comprising substantially the same amino acid sequence as the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 21 or SEQ ID NO: 23 include a) amino acid sequences represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 20, SEQ ID NO: 21, SEQ ID NO: 22, SEQ ID NO: 23 or SEQ ID NO: 24, wherein 1 or more amino acids (for example, 1 to 3 amino acids, preferably 1 or 2 amino acids) are deleted, b) amino acid sequences represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 20, SEQ ID NO: 21, SEQ ID NO: 22, SEQ ID NO: 23 or SEQ ID NO: 24 to which 1 or more amino acids (for example 1 to 3 amino acids, preferably 1 or 2 amino acids) are added, c) amino acid sequences represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 20, SEQ ID NO: 21, SEQ ID NO: 22, SEQ ID NO: 23 or SEQ ID NO: 24, wherein 1 or more amino acids (for example 1 to 3 amino acids, preferably 1 or 2 amino acids) are substituted by other amino acids, and d) polypeptides consisting of a combination of the amino acid sequences described in the above. When the amino acid sequence has undergone insertion, deletion or substitution as described above, the position of the insertion, deletion or substitution is not particularly limited.\n\n\nFPRL1 ligand also includes those wherein a substituent on the side chain of an amino acid in the molecule is protected with a suitable protecting group, or conjugated peptides such as glycopeptides bound to sugar chains.\n\n\nIn addition, FPRL1 ligand includes those wherein an arbitrary extraneous peptide sequence (for example, FLAG, His tag, HA tag, HSV tag etc.) capable of serving as an epitope (antibody recognition site) is added to the N- or C-terminus thereof.\n\n\nFPRL1 ligand is represented in accordance with the conventional way of describing peptides, that is, the N-terminus (amino terminus) at the left hand and the C-terminus (carboxyl terminus) at the right hand. In FPRL1 ligand including the peptide comprising the amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO: 1, the C-terminus may be in the form of a carboxyl group (—COOH), a carboxylate (—COO\n−\n), an amide (—CONH\n2\n) or an ester (—COOR).\n\n\nThe ester group shown by R include, for example, a C\n1-6 \nalkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, or n-butyl; a C\n3-8 \ncycloalkyl group such as cyclopentyl, or cyclohexyl; a C\n6-12 \naryl group such as phenyl, or α-naphthyl; a C\n7-14 \naralkyl group such as a phenyl-C\n1-2\n-alkyl group, e.g., benzyl, phenethyl, etc., or an α-naphthyl-C\n1-2\n-alkyl group such as α-naphthylmethyl, etc. In addition, a pivaloyloxymethyl group or the like which is used widely as an ester for oral administration may also be used.\n\n\nWhere FPRL1 ligand has a carboxyl group (or a carboxylate) at a position other than the C-terminus, it may be amidated or esterified, and such an amide or ester is also included within FPRL1 ligand in the present specification. As the ester group herein, the same esters as those described with respect to the above C-terminal are used.\n\n\nFurthermore, examples of FPRL1 ligand include variants of the above proteins, wherein the N-terminal amino group residue (e.g. methionine residue) thereof is protected with a protecting group (for example, a C\n1-6 \nacyl group such as a C\n1-6 \nalkanoyl group, e.g., formyl group, acetyl group, etc.); those wherein the N-terminal region is cleaved in vivo and the glutamyl group thus formed is pyroglutaminated; those wherein a substituent (e.g., —OH, —SH, amino group, imidazole group, indole group, guanidino group, etc.) on the side chain of an amino acid in the molecule is protected with a suitable protecting group (e.g., a C\n1-6 \nacyl group such as a C\n1-6 \nalkanoyl group, e.g., formyl group, acetyl group, etc.), or conjugated polypeptides such as glycopolypeptides having sugar chains bound thereto. In particular, it is preferred that the amino group of methionine residue at N-terminus is protected by formyl group.

Number of amino acids for the “peptide” moiety is usually 2-50 residues, preferably 2-20 residues.\n\n\nAs salts of FPRL1 ligand, use is made of salts with physiologically acceptable acids (e.g., inorganic acids or organic acids) or bases (e.g., alkali metal salts), preferably physiologically acceptable acid addition salts. Examples of such salts are salts with inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid), salts with organic acids (e.g., acetic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, benzoic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid) and the like.\n\n\nFPRL1 ligand may be manufactured from the human and non-human warm-blooded animal tissues or cells described above by a publicly known purification method for polypeptide, or may also be manufactured by the peptide synthesis method, which will be described below.\n\n\nWhen FPRL1 ligand is manufactured from human and non-human mammalian tissues or cells, the human or non-human mammalian tissues or cells are homogenized, then extracted with an acid or the like, and the extract is isolated and purified by a combination of chromatography techniques such as reverse phase chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and the like.\n\n\nTo synthesize FPRL1 ligand or amides thereof, commercially available resins that are used for polypeptide synthesis may be used. Examples of such resins include chloromethyl resin, hydroxymethyl resin, benzhydrylamine resin, aminomethyl resin, 4-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol resin, 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin, PAM resin, 4-hydroxymethylmethylphenyl acetamidomethyl resin, polyacrylamide resin, 4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenylhydroxymethyl)phenoxy resin, 4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc-aminoethyl) phenoxy resin, etc. Using these resins, amino acids in which α-amino groups and functional groups on the side chains are appropriately protected are condensed on the resin in the order of the sequence of the objective polypeptide according to various condensation methods publicly known in the art. At the end of the reaction, the polypeptide is cut out from the resin and at the same time, the protecting groups are removed. Then, intramolecular disulfide bond-forming reaction is performed in a highly diluted solution to obtain the objective polypeptide or its amides.\n\n\nFor condensation of the protected amino acids described above, a variety of activation reagents for polypeptide synthesis may be used, and carbodiimides are particularly preferable. Examples of such carbodiimides include DCC, N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide, N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, etc. For activation by these reagents, the protected amino acids in combination with a racemization inhibitor (e.g., HOBt, HOOBt) are added directly to the resin, or the protected amino acids are previously activated in the form of symmetric acid anhydrides, HOBt esters or HOOBt esters, followed by adding the thus activated protected amino acids to the resin.\n\n\nSolvents used to activate the protected amino acids or condense with the resin may be chosen from solvents known to be usable for polypeptide condensation reactions. Examples of such solvents are acid amides such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, etc.; halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, etc.; alcohols such as trifluoroethanol, etc.; sulfoxides such as dimethylsulfoxide, etc.; ethers such as pyridine, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, etc.; nitriles such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, etc.; esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, etc.; and appropriate mixtures of these solvents. The reaction temperature is appropriately chosen from the range known to be applicable to polypeptide binding reactions and is usually selected in the range of approximately −20° C. to 50° C. The activated amino acid derivatives are used generally in an excess of 1.5 to 4 times. The condensation is examined by a test using the ninhydrin reaction; when the condensation is insufficient, the condensation can be completed by repeating the condensation reaction without removal of the protecting groups. When the condensation is yet insufficient even after repeating the reaction, unreacted amino acids are acetylated with acetic anhydride or acetylimidazole to cancel any possible adverse effect on the subsequent reaction.\n\n\nExamples of the protecting groups used to protect the amino groups of the starting compounds include Z, Boc, t-pentyloxycarbonyl, isobomyloxycarbonyl, 4-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, Cl—Z, Br—Z, adamantyloxycarbonyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthaloyl, formyl, 2-nitrophenylsulphenyl, diphenylphosphinothioyl, Fmoc, etc.\n\n\nA carboxyl group can be protected by, e.g., alkyl esterification (in the form of linear, branched or cyclic alkyl esters of the alkyl moiety such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, t-butyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, 2-adamantyl, etc.), aralkyl esterification (e.g., esterification in the form of benzyl ester, 4-nitrobenzyl ester, 4-methoxybenzyl ester, 4-chlorobenzyl ester, benzhydryl ester, etc.), phenacyl esterification, benzyloxycarbonyl hydrazidation, t-butoxycarbonyl hydrazidation, trityl hydrazidation, or the like.\n\n\nThe hydroxyl group of serine can be protected through, for example, its esterification or etherification. Examples of groups appropriately used for the esterification include a lower (C\n1-6\n) alkanoyl group, such as acetyl group, an aroyl group such as benzoyl group, and a group derived from carbonic acid, such as benzyloxycarbonyl group, ethoxycarbonyl group, etc. Examples of a group appropriately used for the etherification include benzyl group, tetrahydropyranyl group, t-butyl group, etc.\n\n\nExamples of groups for protecting the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine include Bzl, Cl\n2\n-Bzl, 2-nitrobenzyl, Br—Z, t-butyl, etc.\n\n\nExamples of groups used to protect the imidazole moiety of histidine include Tos, 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonyl, DNP, benzyloxymethyl, Bum, Boc, Trt, Fmoc, etc.\n\n\nExamples of the activated carboxyl groups in the starting compounds include the corresponding acid anhydrides, azides, activated esters (esters with alcohols (e.g., pentachlorophenol, 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, cyanomethyl alcohol, p-nitrophenol, HONB, N-hydroxysuccimide, N-hydroxyphthalimide, HOBt)). As the activated amino acids in which the amino groups are activated in the starting material, the corresponding phosphoric amides are employed.\n\n\nTo eliminate (split off) the protecting groups, there are used catalytic reduction under hydrogen gas flow in the presence of a catalyst such as Pd-black or Pd-carbon; acid treatment with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, methanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid or trifluoroacetic acid, or a mixture solution of these acids; treatment with a base such as diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, piperidine or piperazine; and reduction with sodium in liquid ammonia. The elimination of the protecting group by the acid treatment described above is carried out generally at a temperature of approximately −20° C. to 40° C. In the acid treatment, it is efficient to add a cation scavenger such as anisole, phenol, thioanisole, m-cresol, p-cresol, dimethylsulfide, 1,4-butanedithiol or 1,2-ethanedithiol. Furthermore, 2,4-dinitrophenyl group used as the protecting group for the imidazole of histidine is removed by treatment with thiophenol. Formyl group used as the protecting group of the indole of tryptophan is eliminated by the aforesaid acid treatment in the presence of 1,2-ethanedithiol or 1,4-butanedithiol, as well as by treatment with an alkali such as a dilute sodium hydroxide solution and dilute ammonia.\n\n\nProtection of functional groups that should not be involved in the reaction of the starting materials, protecting groups, elimination of the protecting groups and activation of functional groups involved in the reaction may be appropriately selected from publicly known groups and publicly known means.\n\n\nIn an alternative method for obtaining the amides of FPRL1 ligand, for example, the α-carboxyl group of the carboxy terminal amino acid is first protected by amidation, and the peptide (polypeptide) chain is then extended from the amino group side to a desired length. Thereafter, a polypeptide in which only the protecting group of the N-terminal α-amino group in the peptide chain has been eliminated from the polypeptide and a polypeptide in which only the protecting group of the C-terminal carboxyl group has been eliminated are prepared. The two polypeptides are condensed in a mixture of the solvents described above. The details of the condensation reaction are the same as described above. After the protected polypeptide obtained by the condensation is purified, all the protecting groups are eliminated by the method described above to give the desired crude polypeptide. This crude polypeptide is purified by various known purification means. Lyophilization of the major fraction gives the amide of desired FPRL1 ligand.\n\n\nTo prepare esterified FPRL1 ligand, for example, the α-carboxyl group of the carboxy terminal amino acid is condensed with a desired alcohol to prepare the amino acid ester, which is followed by procedure similar to the preparation of the amidated FPRL1 ligand above to give the ester form of the desired polypeptide.\n\n\nAlternatively, FPRL1 ligand can be manufactured by publicly known methods for peptide synthesis. For the methods for peptide synthesis, for example, either solid phase synthesis or liquid phase synthesis may be used. That is, the partial peptide or amino acids that can construct FPRL1 ligand are condensed with the remaining part. Where the product contains protecting groups, these protecting groups are removed to give the desired peptide. Publicly known methods for condensation and elimination of the protecting groups are described in (a) to (e) below:\n\n \n \n(a) M. Bodanszky & M. A.

When the polypeptide obtained by the above methods is in a free form, the polypeptide can be converted into an appropriate salt by a publicly known method or a modification thereof, when the partial peptide is obtained in a salt form, it can be converted into a free form or another salt by a publicly known method or a modification thereof.\n\n\nAntibody against FPRL1 ligand can be manufactured in a manner similar to the antibody against FPRL1 of the present invention.\n\n\nFPRL1 ligand participate in diseases such as inflammation., and thus FPRL1 ligand (or DNA encoding FPRL1 ligand), FPRL1, DNA encoding FPRL1 (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the DNA of the present invention), the antibody against FPRL1 ligand or FPRL1 (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the antibody of the present invention), the antisense DNA to the DNA of the present invention (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the antisense DNA of the present invention) have the following uses.\n\n\n(1) Prophylactic/Therapeutic Agent for Diseases Associated with Dysfunction of FPRL1 of the Present Invention\n\n\nFPRL1 ligand possesses, for example, a cell migration stimulating activity (e.g., a stimulating activity for migration of cells such as neutrophil, macrophage and microglia). In addition, where FPRL1 ligand, FPRL1 or the polynucleotide (for example, DNA etc.) encoding the same is abnormal or deficient, or where the expression level of the same is abnormally reduced or promoted, there occur a variety of diseases involving asthma, allergosis, inflammation, inflammatory eye diseases, Assison's disease, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, rheumatism, central nervous system damage (e.g., cerebrovascular diseases such as brain hemorrhage and brain infarction, head injury, cord injury, brain edema and multiple sclerosis), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and encephalopathy associated with AIDS), cerebral meningitis, diabetes mellitis, arthritis (e.g., arthritis rheumatoides, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, gouty arthritis and synovial inflammation), blood poisoning (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram-negative sepsis and toxic-shock syndrome), inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), inflammatory pulmonary diseases (e.g., chronic pneumonia, pulmonary silicosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis and lung tuberculosis), cachexia (e.g., infectious cachexia, canoerous cachexia and cachexia associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)), arterial sclerosis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, viral infection (e.g., viral infection by cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, herpes virus and the like), angina cordis, cardiac infarction, congestive failure, hepatitis, exaggerated immune response after medical transplantation, dialysis hypotension, diffuse intravascular coagulation syndrome, and immunodeficiency.\n\n\nAccordingly, when the physiological activity of FPRL1 ligand cannot be expected in a patient (deficiency of FPRL1 ligand or FPRL1) due to a decrease in FPRL1 ligand or FPRL1 in the living body, the activity of the FPRL1 ligand can be exhibited by (i) administering FPRL1 ligand or FPRL1 to the patient thereby supplementing the amount of the FPRL1 ligand or FPRL1 or (ii) by increasing the amount of FPRL1 ligand or FPRL1 in the patient through (a) administration of the DNA encoding FPRL1 to express the same in the patient or (b) insertion and expression of the DNA encoding FPRL1 in the objective cells to transplant the cells to the patient, whereby the activity of the FPRL1 ligand can be sufficiently exhibited.\n\n\nAccordingly, (a) FPRL1 ligand, (b) FPRL1, or (c) the DNA encoding FPRL1 may be use as a medicament such as prophylactic/therapeutic agent for diseases associated with dysfunction of FPRL1 ligand or FPRL1.\n\n\nSpecifically, FPRL1 ligand, FPRL1 or the DNA of the present invention can be used as, for example, a cell migration irritant (or a cell migration accerelator) and an anti-inflammatory agent.

The DNA of the present invention may also be administered as naked DNA, or with adjuvants to assist its uptake by gene gun or through a catheter such as a catheter with a hydrogel.\n\n\nFor example, (a) FPRL1 ligand, (b) FPRL1 or (c) the DNA of the present invention can be used orally in the form of tablets which may be sugar coated if necessary and desired, capsules, elixirs, microcapsules etc., or parenterally in the form of injectable preparations such as a sterile solution and a suspension in water or with other pharmaceutically acceptable liquid.

When the unit dosage is in the form of capsules, liquid carriers such as oils and fats may further be used together with the additives described above. A sterile composition for injection may be formulated according to a conventional manner used to make pharmaceutical compositions, e.g., by dissolving or suspending the active ingredient in a vehicle such as water for injection, with a naturally occurring vegetable oil such as sesame oil, coconut oil, etc. to prepare the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of an aqueous medium for injection include physiological saline and an isotonic solution containing glucose and other auxiliary agents (e.g., D-sorbitol, D-mannitol, sodium chloride, etc.) and may be used in combination with an appropriate solubilizer such as an alcohol (e.g., ethanol or the like), a polyalcohol (e.g., propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol), a nonionic surfactant (e.g., \npolysorbate\n 80™ and HCO-50), etc. Examples of the oily medium include sesame oil, soybean oil, etc., which may also be used in combination with a solubilizer such as benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, etc.\n\n\nThe prophylactic/therapeutic agent may further be formulated with a buffer (e.g., phosphate buffer, sodium acetate buffer, etc.), a soothing agent (e.g., benzalkonium chloride, procaine hydrochloride, etc.), a stabilizer (e.g., human serum albumin, polyethylene glycol, etc.), a preservative (e.g., benzyl alcohol, phenol, etc.), an antioxidant, etc. The thus prepared liquid for injection is normally filled in an appropriate ampoule.\n\n\nThe thus obtained pharmaceutical preparation is safe and low toxic, and can thus be administered to, for example, humans and mammals (e.g., rat, mouse, rabbit, sheep, swine, bovine, cat, dog, monkey etc.)\n\n\nThe doses of FPRL1 ligand may vary depending on subject to be administered, target organ, symptom, administration method, etc. When the ligand is orally administered, the ligand is administered to a patient with inflammation (as 60 kg) generally in a daily dose of approximately 0.1 to 100 mg, preferably approximately 1.0 to 50 mg, more preferably approximately 1.0 to 20 mg. When the ligand is parenterally administered, a single dose may vary depending on subject to be administered, target organ, symptom, administration method, etc. When the ligand is administered in the form of an injection to a patient with inflammation (as 60 kg), it is convenient to administer the ligand by intravenous injection generally in a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to 30 mg, preferably approximately 0.1 to 20 mg, more preferably approximately 0.1 to 10 mg. For other animal species, the corresponding dose as converted per 60 kg weight can be administered.\n\n\nThe dose of the DNA of the present invention may vary depending on subject to be administered, target organ, symptom, administration method, etc. When the DNA is orally administered, the DNA is administered to a patient with inflammation (as 60 kg) generally in a daily dose of approximately 0.1 to 100 mg, preferably approximately 1.0 to 50 mg, more preferably approximately 1.0 to 20 mg.

overexpression, etc. of the DNA or mRNA.\n\n\nThe gene diagnosis described above using the DNA or antisense DNA of the present invention can be performed by, for example, the publicly known Northern hybridization assay or the PCR-SSCP assay (Genomics, 5, 874-879 (1989); Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 86, 2766-2770 (1989)), etc.\n\n\nWhen decreased

detected by the Northern hybridization or when DNA mutation is detected by the PCR-SSCP assay, it can be diagnosed that he or she suffers from, or is highly likely to suffer from diseases, for example, diseases caused by over-expression of FPRL1 such as infectious disease.\n\n\nIn addition, when over-expression of FPRL1 is detected by the Northern hybridization or when DNA mutation is

These preparations can be manufactured for example by mixing the compound or its salt with a physiologically acceptable known carrier, a flavoring agent, an excipient, a vehicle, an antiseptic agent, a stabilizer, a binder, etc. in a unit dosage form required in a generally accepted manner that is applied to making pharmaceutical preparations. The active ingredient in the preparation is controlled in such a dose that an appropriate dose is obtained within the specified range given.\n\n\nAdditives miscible with tablets, capsules, etc. include a binder such as gelatin, corn starch, tragacanth and gum arabic, an excipient such as crystalline cellulose, a swelling agent such as corn starch, gelatin, alginic acid, etc., a lubricant such as magnesium stearate, a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin, and a flavoring agent such as peppermint, akamono oil or cherry.

A sterile composition for injection may be formulated according to a conventional manner used to make pharmaceutical compositions, e.g., by dissolving or suspending the active ingredients in a vehicle such as water for injection with a naturally occurring vegetable oil such as sesame oil, coconut oil, etc. to prepare the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of an aqueous medium for injection include physiological saline and an isotonic solution containing glucose and other auxiliary agents (e.g., D-sorbitol, D-mannitol, sodium chloride, etc.) and may be used in combination with an appropriate solubilizer such as an alcohol (e.g., ethanol or the like), a polyalcohol (e.g., propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol), a nonionic surfactant (e.g., \npolysorbate\n 80™ and HCO-50), etc. Examples of the oily medium include sesame oil, soybean oil, etc., which may also be used in combination with a solubilizer such as benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, etc.\n\n\nThe prophylactic/therapeutic agent described above may further be formulated with a buffer (e.g., phosphate buffer, sodium acetate buffer, etc.), a soothing agent (e.g., benzalkonium chloride, procaine hydrochloride, etc.), a stabilizer (e.g., human serum albumin, polyethylene glycol, etc.), a preservative (e.g., benzyl alcohol, phenol, etc.), an antioxidant, etc. The thus prepared liquid for injection is normally filled in an appropriate ampoule.\n\n\nThe thus obtained pharmaceutical preparation is safe and low toxic, and can thus be administered to, for example, human and mammals (e.g., rat, mouse, rabbit, sheep, swine, bovine, cat, dog, monkey, etc.).\n\n\nThe dose of the compound or its salt may vary depending on subject to be administered, target organ, symptom, administration method, etc. When the compound or its salt that increases the expression level of FPRL1 of the present invention is orally administered, the compound is administered to a patient with inflammation (as 60 kg) generally in a daily dose of approximately 0.1 to 100 mg, preferably approximately 1.0 to 50 mg, more preferably approximately 1.0 to 20 mg.

For other animal species, the corresponding dose as converted per 60 kg weight can be administered.\n\n\n(4) Diagnostic Method using the Antibody of the Present Invention\n\n\nThe antibody against FPRL1 ligand is capable of specifically recognizing FPRL1 ligand of the present invention and can thus be used for detection or neutralization of FPRL1 ligand of the present invention in a test sample fluid.\n\n\nThe antibody against FPRL1 is capable of specifically recognizing FPRL1 of the present invention and can thus be used for detection or neutralization of FPRL1 of the present invention in a test sample fluid.\n\n\nIt will be described about a method for quantifying FPRL1 using the antibody against FPRL1 of the present invention below. A method for quantifying FPRL1 ligand using the antibody against FPRL1 ligand of the present invention may be carried out in the same manner.\n\n\nThat is, the present invention provides:\n\n\n(i) A method for quantifying FPRL1 in a test sample fluid, which comprises competitively reacting the antibody of the present invention, a test sample fluid and a labeled form of FPRL1, and measuring the ratio of the labeled FPRL1 of the present invention bound to said antibody; and.\n\n\n(ii) A method for quantifying FPRL1 in a test sample fluid, which comprises reacting the test sample fluid simultaneously or continuously with the antibody of the present invention immobilized on a carrier and a labeled form of the antibody of the present invention, and then measuring the activity of the labeling agent on the insoluble carrier.\n\n\nIn the quantification method in the above-mentioned (ii), it is desirable that one antibody is an antibody recognizing the N-terminal region of FPRL1, and the other antibody is an antibody reacting with the C-terminal region of FPRL1.\n\n\nThe monoclonal antibody against FPRL1 may be used to quantify FPRL1. Besides, FPRL1 may also be detected by means of tissue staining. For these purposes, the antibody molecule per se may be used, or F(ab′)\n2\n, Fab′ or Fab fractions of the antibody molecule may be used as well.\n\n\nThere is no particular limitation to the method of quantifying FPRL1 using the antibody of the present invention; any method may be used so far as it relates to a method in which the amount of antibody, antigen or antibody-antigen complex can be detected by a chemical or a physical means, depending on or corresponding to the amount of antigen (e.g., the amount of FPRL1) in a test sample fluid to be assayed, and then calculated using a standard curve prepared by a standard solution containing the known amount of antigen. Advantageously used are, for example, nephrometry, competitive method, immunometric method and sandwich method; in terms of sensitivity and specificity, the sandwich method, which will be later described, is particularly preferred.\n\n\nExamples of the labeling agent used in the assay method using the labeling substance are radioisotopes, enzymes, fluorescent substances, luminescent substances, etc. Examples of the radioisotope are [\n125\nI], [\n131\nI], [\n3\nH], [\n14\nC], etc. Preferred examples of the enzyme are those that are stable and have a high specific activity, which include β-galactosidase, β-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, peroxidase, malate dehydrogenase, etc. Examples of the fluorescent substance are fluorescamine, fluorescein isothiocyanate, etc. Examples of the luminescent substance are luminol, a luminol derivative, luciferin, lucigenin, etc. Furthermore, the biotin-avidin system may also be used for binding of an antibody or antigen to a labeling agent.\n\n\nIn the immobilization of antigens or antibodies, physical adsorption may be used. Alternatively, chemical binding conventionally used for immobilization of FPRL1 or enzymes may be used as well. Examples of the carrier include insoluble polysaccharides such as agarose, dextran and cellulose; synthetic resins such as polystyrene, polyacrylamide, silicone, etc.; glass; and the like.\n\n\nIn the sandwich method, a test sample fluid is reacted with an immobilized form of the monoclonal antibody of the present invention (primary reaction), then reacted with another labeled form of the monoclonal antibody of the present invention (secondary reaction) and the activity of the labeling agent on the insoluble carrier is assayed, whereby the amount of FPRL1 in the test sample fluid can be quantified. The primary and secondary reactions may be carried out in a reversed order, simultaneously or sequentially with an interval. The type of the labeling agent and the method for immobilization may be effected by modifications of those described hereinabove. In the immunoassay by the sandwich method, it is not always necessary that the antibody used for the labeled antibody and for the solid phase should be one type or one species but a mixture of two or more antibodies may be used as well, for the purpose of improving the measurement sensitivity, etc.\n\n\nIn the method for assaying FPRL1 by the sandwich method according to the present invention, preferred monoclonal antibodies of the present invention used for the primary and the secondary reactions are antibodies whose binding sites to FPRL1 are different from one another. Thus, the antibodies used in the primary and the secondary reactions are those wherein when the antibody used in the secondary reaction recognizes the C-terminal region of FPRL1, the antibody recognizing the site other than the C-terminal region, e.g., recognizing the N-terminal region, is preferably used in the primary reaction.\n\n\nThe monoclonal antibody of the present invention may be used in an assay system other than the sandwich method, such as a competitive method, an immunometric method, nephrometry, etc.\n\n\nIn the competitive method, an antigen in a test sample fluid and a labeled antigen are competitively reacted with an antibody, then the unreacted labeled antigen (F) and the labeled antigen bound to the antibody (B) are separated (i.e., B/F separation) and the labeled amount of either B or F is measured to determine the amount of the antigen in the test sample fluid. In the reactions for such a method, there are a liquid phase method in which a soluble antibody is used as the antibody and the B/F separation is effected by polyethylene glycol while a second antibody to the antibody described above is used, and a solid phase method in which an immobilized antibody is used as the first antibody or a soluble antibody is used as the first antibody while an immobilized antibody is used as the second antibody.\n\n\nIn the immunometric method, an antigen in a test sample fluid and an immobilized antigen are competitively reacted with a given amount of a labeled antibody followed by separating the solid phase from the liquid phase; or an antigen in a test sample fluid and an excess amount of labeled antibody are reacted, then an immobilized antigen is added to bind an unreacted labeled antibody to the solid phase, and the solid phase is separated from the liquid phase. Thereafter, the labeled amount of any of the phases is measured to determine the antigen amount in the test sample fluid.\n\n\nIn the nephrometry, the amount of insoluble sediment, which is produced as a result of the antigen-antibody reaction in a gel or in a solution, is measured. Even when the amount of an antigen in a test sample fluid is small and only a small amount of the sediment is obtained, laser nephrometry utilizing laser scattering can be suitably used.\n\n\nIn applying each of those immunoassays to the quantification method of the present invention, any special conditions or operations are not required to set forth. The assay system for FPRL1 of the present invention may be constructed in addition to conditions or operations conventionally used for each of the methods, taking the technical consideration by one skilled in the art into account.\n\n\nFor the details of such conventional technical means, a variety of reviews, reference books, etc. may be referred to (for example, Hiroshi Irie (ed.): “Radioimmunoassay” (published by Kodansha, 1974); Hiroshi Irie (ed.): “Radioimmunoassay; Second Series” (published by Kodansha, 1979); Eiji Ishikawa, et al.

(b) compounds that inhibit the FPRL1-mediated cell-stimulating activity (so-called antagonists to FPRL1 of the present invention); (c) compounds that potentiate the binding affinity between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention; or (d) compounds that reduce the binding affinity between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention.\n\n\nThe cell stimulating activity includes, e.g., activities that promote or suppress arachidonic acid release, acetylcholine release, intracellular Ca\n2+\n release, intracellular cAMP production, intracellular cGMP production, inositol phosphate production, changes in cell membrane potential, phosphorylation of intracellular proteins, activation of c-fos, pH reduction, a cell migration stimulating activity (or a cell migration accelerating activity). Among them, an inhibiting activity for intracellular production, and a cell migration stimulating activity (or a cell migration accelerating activity) are preferred.\n\n\nThat is, the present invention provides a method for screening a compound or its salt that alters binding property or signal transduction between FPRL1 and FPRL1 ligand of the present invention, which comprises comparing (i) the case where FPRL1 of the present invention is brought in contact with a FPR1 ligand, with (ii) the case where FPRL1 of the present invention is brought in contact with FPRL1 ligand and a test compound.\n\n\nThe screening method of the present invention comprises measuring, for example, a binding level of FPRL1 ligand to FPRL1, or a cell stimulating activity in (i) and (ii), and comparing the results.\n\n\nFor FPRL1 ligand, as substitute for the aforementioned FPRL1 ligand, a compound that alters binding property between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention, or a salt thereof (e.g., low-molecular-weight synthetic compound, preferably low-molecular-weight synthetic agonist) can be used. The compound that alters binding property between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention, or a salt thereof can be obtained using the screening method described later. In the screening method of the present invention, those including the compound that alters binding property between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention, or a salt thereof refers to as FPRL1 ligand.\n\n\nMore specifically, the present invention provides the following screening methods:\n\n\n(a) A method of screening a compound or its salt that alters the binding property or signal transduction between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention, which comprises measuring and comparing the binding level of labeled FPRL1 ligand to FPRL1, when the labeled FPRL1 ligand is brought into contact with FPRL1 of the present invention and when the labeled FPRL1 ligand and a test compound are brought into contact with FPRL1 of the present invention;\n\n\n(b) A method of screening a compound or its salt that alters the binding property or signal transduction between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention, which comprises measuring and comparing the binding level of labeled FPRL1 ligand to cells or the membrane fraction of the cells, when the labeled FPRL1 ligand is brought into contact with the cells or cell membrane fraction containing FPRL1 of the present invention and when the labeled FPRL1 ligand and a test compound are brought into contact with the cells or cell membrane fraction containing FPRL1 of the present invention;\n\n\n(c) A method of screening a compound or its salt that alters the binding property or information transduction between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention, which comprises measuring and comparing the binding level of labeled FPRL1 ligand to FPRL1, when the labeled FPRL1 ligand is brought into contact with FPRL1 expressed on the cell membrane induced by culturing a transformant containing the DNA of the present invention and when the labeled FPRL1 ligand and a test compound are brought into contact with FPRL1 of the present invention expressed on the cell membrane induced by culturing a transformant containing the DNA of the present invention;\n\n\n(d) A method of screening a compound or its salt that alters the binding property or information transduction between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention, which comprises measuring and comparing the FPRL1-mediated cell-stimulating activity, when a compound or its salt (e.g., FPRL1 ligand to FPRL1 of the present invention) that activates FPRL1 of the present invention is brought into contact with cells containing FPRL1 of the present invention and when the compound that activates FPRL1 of the present invention and a test compound are brought into contact with cells containing FPRL1 of the present invention; and\n\n\n(e) A method of screening a compound or its salt that alters the binding property or information transduction between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention, which comprises measuring and comparing the FPRL1-mediated cell-stimulating activity, when a compound or its salt (e.g., FPRL1 ligand to FPRL1 of the present invention) that activates FPRL1 of the present invention is brought into contact with FPRL1 of the present invention expressed on the cell membrane induced by culturing a transformant containing the DNA of the present invention and when the compound that activates FPRL1 of the present invention and a test compound are brought into contact with FPRL1 of the present invention expressed on the cell membrane induced by culturing a transformant containing the DNA of the present invention.\n\n\nHereinafter, the screening methods of the present invention are described more specifically.\n\n\nAs FPRL1 of the present invention used in the screening methods of the present invention, any substance may be used so long as it comprises FPRL1 of the present invention described above. The cell membrane fraction from mammalian organs containing FPRL1 of the present invention is preferred. However, it is very difficult to obtain human organs, and thus human-derived FPRL1 or the like, produced by large-scale expression using recombinants, is preferably used in screening.\n\n\nFPRL1 of the present invention can be manufactured by the method described above, preferably by expressing the DNA of the present invention in mammalian or insect cells. As DNA fragments encoding the desired portion of the protein, complementary DNA is generally used but not necessarily limited thereto. For example, gene fragments or synthetic DNA may also be used. For introducing a DNA fragment encoding FPRL1 of the present invention into host animal cells and efficiently expressing the same, it is preferred to insert the DNA fragment downstream a polyhedrin promoter of nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV), which is a baculovirus having insect hosts, an SV40-derived promoter, a retrovirus promoter, a metallothionein promoter, a human heat shock promoter, a cytomegalovirus promoter, an SRa promoter or the like. The amount and quality of the receptor expressed can be determined by a publicly known method. For example, this determination can be made by the method described in the literature (Nambi, P., et al., J. Biol. Chem., 267, 19555-19559 (1992)).\n\n\nAccordingly, the subject containing FPRL1 of the present invention in the screening method of the present invention may be FPRL1 purified by publicly known methods, cells containing FPRL1, or membrane fractions of such cells.\n\n\nWhere cells containing FPRL1 of the present invention are used in the screening method of the present invention, the cells may be fixed using glutaraldehyde, formalin, etc. The fixation can be made by a publicly known method.\n\n\nThe cells containing FPRL1 of the present invention are host cells that have expressed the FPRL1, and as the host cells, preferred are \nEscherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis\n, yeast, insect cells, animal cells, and the like.\n\n\nThe cell membrane fraction refers to a fraction abundant in cell membrane obtained by cell disruption and subsequent fractionation by a publicly known method. Cell disruption methods include cell squashing using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer, disruption using a Waring blender or Polytron (manufactured by Kinematica Inc.), disruption by ultrasonication, and disruption by cell spraying through thin nozzles under an increased pressure using a French press or the like. Cell membrane fractionation is effected mainly by fractionation using a centrifugal force, such as centrifugation for fractionation and density gradient centrifugation. For example, cell disruption fluid is centrifuged at a low speed (500 rpm to 3,000 rpm) for a short period of time (normally about 1 to about 10 minutes), the resulting supernatant is then centrifuged at a higher speed (15,000 rpm to 30,000 rpm) normally for 30 minutes to 2 hours. The precipitate thus obtained is used as the membrane fraction. The membrane fraction is rich in FPRL1 expressed and membrane components such as cell-derived phospholipids and membrane proteins.\n\n\nThe amount of FPRL1 in the cells containing FPRL1 and in the membrane fraction is preferably 10\n3 \nto 10\n8 \nmolecules per cell, more preferably 10\n5 \nto 10\n7 \nmolecules per cell. As the amount of expression increases, the ligand binding activity per unit of membrane fraction (specific activity) increases so that not only the highly sensitive screening system can be constructed but also large quantities of samples can be assayed with the same lot.\n\n\nTo perform the above-mentioned (a) to (c) for screening the compounds or salts thereof that alter the binding property or signal transduction between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention, for example, an appropriate FPRL1 fraction and labeled FPRL1 ligand are necessary.\n\n\nThe FPRL1 fraction is preferably a fraction of naturally occurring FPRL1, or a recombinant FPRL1 fraction having an activity equivalent to that of natural FPRL1. Herein, the equivalent activity is intended to mean a ligand binding activity, a signal. information transduction activity or the like that is equivalent to that possessed by naturally occurring FPRL1.\n\n\nAs labeled FPRL1 ligand, for example FPRL1 ligand labeled with [\n3\nH], [\n125\nI], [\n14\nC], [\n35\nS] or the like is used.\n\n\nSpecifically, to screen the compounds that alter the binding property or signal transduction between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention, first, an FPRL1 standard is prepared by suspending cells or cell membrane fraction containing FPRL1 of the present invention in a buffer appropriate for the screening. As the buffer, any buffer that does not interfere with the binding between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 is usable and examples of such a buffer are phosphate buffer, Tris-hydrochloride buffer, etc., having pH of 4 to 10 (preferably pH of 6 to 8). To minimize non-specific binding, a surfactant such as CHAPS, Tween-80™ (Kao-Atlas Co.), digitonin, deoxycholate, etc. may be added to the buffer. To inhibit degradation of the receptor and FPRL1 ligand by proteases, protease inhibitors such as PMSF, leupeptin, E-64 (manufactured by Peptide Research Laboratory, Co.), and pepstatin may be added. To 0.01 to 10 ml of the receptor protein solution, a given amount (5,000 to 500,000 cpm) of labeled FPRL1 ligand is added, and 10\n−4 \nM to 10\n−10 \nM of a test compound is simultaneously added to be co-present. To examine non-specific binding (NSB), a reaction tube containing unlabeled humanin in a large excess is also prepared. The reaction is carried out at approximately 0 to 50° C., preferably about 4 to 37° C. for about 20 minutes to about 24 hours, preferably about 30 minutes to about 3 hours. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is filtrated through glass fiber filter paper, etc. and washed with an appropriate volume of the same buffer. The residual radioactivity on the glass fiber filter paper is then measured by means of a liquid scintillation counter or γ-counter. Assuming that the count obtained by subtracting the amount of non-specific binding (NSB) from the count obtained in the absence of any competitive substance (B\n0\n) is 100%, the test compound by which the amount of specific binding (B-NSB) is reduced to e.g. 50% or less can be selected as a candidate substance having a potential of competitive inhibition.\n\n\nTo perform the methods (d) to (e) supra of screening the compounds that alter the binding property and signal transduction between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention, the FPRL1-mediated cell-stimulating activity can be measured using publicly known methods or commercially available kits.\n\n\nSpecifically, the cells containing FPRL1 of the present invention are first cultured on a multi-well plate, etc. Prior to screening, the medium is replaced with fresh medium or with an appropriate non-cytotoxic buffer, followed by incubation for a given period of time in the presence of a test compound, etc. Subsequently, the cells are extracted or the supernatant is recovered and the resulting product is quantified by appropriate procedures. Where it is difficult to detect the production of the index substance (e.g., arachidonic acid, cAMP, etc.) for the cell-stimulating activity due to a degrading enzyme contained in the cells, an inhibitor against such a degrading enzyme may be added prior to the assay. For detecting activities such as the cAMP production suppression activity, the baseline production in the cells is increased by forskolin or the like and the suppressing effect on the increased baseline production may then be detected.\n\n\nScreening by assaying the cell-stimulating activity requires cells that have expressed appropriate FPRL1. For the cells that have expressed FPRL1 of the present invention, the cell strain possessing naturally occurring FPRL1 of the present invention, the cell strain expressing the recombinant FPRL1 described above and the like are desirable.\n\n\nFor the test compound, for example, peptides, proteins, non-peptide compounds, synthetic compounds, fermentation products, cell extracts, plant extracts, and animal tissue extracts are used. These compounds may be novel or known compounds.\n\n\nThe test compounds may form salts, and as salts of the test compounds, use is made of salts with physiologically acceptable acids (e.g., inorganic acids etc.) or bases (e.g., organic acids etc.), preferably physiologically acceptable acid addition salts. Examples of such salts are salts with inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid etc.), salts with organic acids (e.g., acetic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, benzoic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid etc.) and the like.\n\n\nThe test compound used is preferably a compound which on the basis of the atomic coordinates of an FPRL1 active site and the position of a ligand binding pocket, is designed to bind to the ligand binding pocket. The atomic coordinates of the FPRL1 active site and the position of the ligand binding pocket can be measured by a publicly known method or a modification thereof.\n\n\nThe kit for screening the compounds or salts thereof that alter the binding property or signal transduction between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention comprises FPRL1 of the present invention, cells containing FPRL1 of the present invention, or a membrane fraction of cells containing FPRL1 of the present invention.\n\n\nFor example, the screening kit of the present invention includes:\n\n\n1.

Measurement Method\n\n\n(a) CHO cells expressing FPRL1 of the present invention are cultured in a 12-well culture plate and washed twice with 1 ml of the measurement buffer, and 490 μl of the measurement buffer is added to each well.\n\n\n(b) After adding 5 μl of 10\n−3 \nto 10\n−10 \nM test compound solution, 5 μl of labeled FPRL1 ligand is added to the mixture, and the cells are incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. To determine the amount of the non-specific binding, 5 μl of 10\n−3 \nM FPRL1 ligand is added in place of the test compound.\n\n\n(c) The reaction solution is removed, and the wells are washed 3 times with 1 ml of the washing buffer. The labeled FPRL1 ligand bound to the cells is dissolved in 0.2 N NaOH-1% SDS, and mixed with 4 ml of liquid scintillator A (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.).\n\n\n(d) The radioactivity is measured using a liquid scintillation counter (manufactured by Beckman Co.), and the percent maximum binding (PMB) is calculated by the equation below.\n\n\n\nPMB\n=[(\nB−NSB\n)/(\nB\n \n0\n \n−NSB\n)]×100\n\n \n \nPMB: Percent maximum binding\n \nB: Value obtained in the presence of a test compound\n \nNSB: Non-specific binding\n \nB\n0\n: Maximum binding\n \n\n\nTo determine if the compound is agonists or antagonists to FPRL1, the following specific procedure (i) or (ii) is available.\n\n\n(i) The binding assay described in the screening method of (a) through (c) supra is performed to obtain the compound that alters the binding property between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 (especially inhibits the binding) followed by assay for the compound to determine if the compound has the cell stimulating activities described above. The compound having the cell stimulating activities, or its salts are agonists to FPRL1 of the present invention, whereas the compound having no such activity or its salts are agonists to FPRL1 of the present invention.\n\n\n(ii)(a) A test compound is brought into contact with FPRL1-containing cells to assay the above-mentioned cell stimulating activities. The compound having the cell stimulating activities or its salts are agonists to FPRL1 of the present invention.\n\n\n(b) The FPRL1-mediated cell stimulating activities are assayed both when a compound (e.g., ligand) that activates FPRL1 is brought into contact with the FPRL1-containing cells and when the compound that activates FPRL1 and a test compound are brought into contact with the FPRL1-containing cells and comparison is made on the cell stimulating activities between the two cases. The compound or its salts that can reduce the cell stimulating activities by the FPRL1-activating compound are antagonists to FPRL1 of the present invention.\n\n\nThe compounds or their salts, which are obtained using the screening methods or the screening kits of the present invention, are the compounds that alter the binding property or signal transduction between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention. Specifically, these compounds include (a) compounds that have the FPRL1-mediated cell-stimulating activity (so-called agonists to FPRL1 of the present invention), (b) compounds having no cell stimulating-activity (so-called antagonists to FPRL1 of the present invention), (c) compounds that potentiate the binding affinity between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention, and (d) compounds that reduce the binding affinity between FPRL1 ligandand FPRL1 of the present invention.\n\n\nThe compounds which are obtained using the screening methods or the screening kits of the present invention include peptides, proteins, non-peptide compounds, synthetic compounds and fermentation products, and may be novel or publicly known compounds.\n\n\nThe compound obtained by the screening method of the present invention or the screening kit of the present invention may be in the form of salt. As salts of the compounds, use is made of salts with physiologically acceptable acids (e.g., inorganic acids etc.) or bases (e.g., organic acids etc.), preferably physiologically acceptable acid addition salts. Examples of such salts are salts with inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid), salts with organic acids (e.g., acetic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, benzoic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid etc.) and the like.\n\n\nSince agonists to FPRL1 of the present invention have the same physiological activities as those of FPRL1 ligand, the agonists are useful as safe and low toxic medicament, correspondingly to the physiological activities of FPRL1 ligand.\n\n\nSince antagonists to FPRL1 of the present invention can suppress the physiological activities of FPRL1 ligand, the antagonists are useful as safe and low toxic medicament that inhibits the physiological activities of FPRL1 ligand.\n\n\nThe compounds or their salts that potentiate the binding affinity between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention are useful as safe and low toxic medicament to potentiate the physiological activities of FPRL1 ligand.\n\n\nThe compounds that reduce the binding affinity between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention are useful as safe and low toxic medicament that decreases the physiological activities of FPRL1 ligand.\n\n\nSpecifically, the compound or a salt thereof obtained using the screening method or screening kit of the present invention, particularly the compound or its salt, which potentiates the binding affinity between agonist or FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention, can be used as, for example, a low-toxic and safe cell migration irritant (or a cell migration accelerator), or an anti-inflammatory agent, further a prophylactic/therapeutic agent for

Examples of an aqueous medium for injection include physiological saline and an isotonic solution containing glucose and other auxiliary agents (e.g., D-sorbitol, D-mannitol, sodium chloride, etc.) and may be used in combination with an appropriate solubilizer such as an alcohol (e.g., ethanol), a polyalcohol (e.g., propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol), a nonionic surfactant (e.g., \npolysorbate\n 80™ and HCO-50), etc. Examples of the oily medium include sesame oil, soybean oil, etc., which may also be used in combination with a solubilizer such as benzyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, etc.\n\n\nThe prophylactic/therapeutic agent described above may further be formulated with a buffer (e.g., phosphate buffer, sodium acetate buffer, etc.), a soothing agent (e.g., benzalkonium chloride, procaine hydrochloride, etc.), a stabilizer (e.g., human serum albumin, polyethylene glycol, etc.), a preservative (e.g., benzyl alcohol, phenol, etc.), an antioxidant, etc. The thus prepared liquid for injection is normally filled in an appropriate ampoule.\n\n\nThe thus obtained pharmaceutical preparation is safe and low toxic, and can thus be administered to, for example, human and mammals (e.g., rat, mouse, rabbit, sheep, swine, bovine, cat, dog, monkey, etc.).\n\n\nThe dose of the compound or its salt may vary depending on subject to be administered, target organ, symptom, administration method, etc. When the compound or its salt that increases the amount of FPRL1 of the present invention is orally administered, the compound or its salt is administered to a patient with inflammation (as 60 kg) generally in a daily dose of approximately 0.1 to 100 mg, preferably approximately 1.0 to 50 mg, more preferably approximately 1.0 to 20 mg. When the compound or its salt is parenterally administered, a single dose of the compound or its salt may vary depending on subject to be administered, target organ, symptom, administration method, etc. When the compound or its salt that increases the amount of FPRL1 of the present invention is administered to a patient with inflammation (as 60 kg) in the form of injection, it is convenient to administer the compound or its salt by intravenous injection, generally in a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to 30 mg, preferably approximately 0.1 to 20 mg, more preferably approximately 0.1 to 10 mg. For other animal species, the corresponding dose as converted per 60 kg weight can be administered.\n\n\n(7) Medicament Comprising the Antibody Against FPRL1 of the Present Invention\n\n\nThe neutralizing activity of the antibody against FPRL1 of the present invention refers to an activity of inactivating the signal transduction function in which FPRL1 is involved. Therefore, when the antibody has the neutralizing activity, the antibody can inactivate the signal transduction in which FPRL1 is involved, for example, inactivate the FPRL1-mediated cell-stimulating activity (e.g., activity that promotes or inhibits arachidonic acid release, acetylcholine release, intracellular Ca\n2+\n release, intracellular cAMP production, intracellular cGMP production, inositol phosphate production, changes in cell membrane potential, phosphorylation of intracellular proteins, activation of c-fos, pH reduction, or a cell migration stimulating activity, particularly inhibiting activity of intracellular cAMP production, or a cell migration stimulating activity (or a cell migration accelerating activity)).\n\n\nTherefore, the antibody against FPRL1 of the present invention (for example, the neutralizing antibody) can be used as a low-toxic and safe medicament such as a cell migration depressant, or a prophylactic/therapeutic agent for diseases caused by over-expression of FPRL1 or an excess of FPRL1 ligand.\n\n\nIn addition, the antibody against FPRL1 of the present invention can also be used as an anti-inflammatory agent, or a prophylactic/therapeutic agent for diseases including, e.g., asthma, allergosis, inflammation, inflammatory eye diseases, Assison's disease, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, rheumatism, central nervous system damage (e.g., cerebrovascular diseases such as brain hemorrhage and brain infarction, head injury, cord injury, brain edema and multiple sclerosis), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and encephalopathy associated with AIDS), cerebral meningitis, diabetes mellitis, arthritis (e.g., arthritis rheumatoides, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, gouty arthritis and synovial inflammation), blood poisoning (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram-negative sepsis and toxic-shock syndrome), inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), inflammatory pulmonary diseases (e.g., chronic pneumonia, pulmonary silicosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis and lung tuberculosis), cachexia (e.g., infectious cachexia, canoerous cachexia and cachexia associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)), arterial sclerosis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, viral infection (e.g., viral infection by cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, herpes virus and the like), angina cordis, cardiac infarction, congestive failure, hepatitis, exaggerated immune response after medical transplantation, dialysis hypotension, diffuse intravascular coagulation syndrome, and immunodeficiency.\n\n\nThe above prophylactic/therapeutic agent can be produced and used in the same manner as for the medicament comprising FPRL1 of the present invention described above.\n\n\n(8) Medicament Comprising the Antisense DNA or siRNA of the Present Invention\n\n\nThe antisense DNA or siRNA of the present invention can be used as a low-toxic and safe medicament such as, for example, a cell migration depressant, or a prophylactic/therapeutic agent for diseases caused by over-expression of FPRL1 or an excess of FPRL1 ligand.\n\n\nIn addition, the antisense DNA or siRNA of the present invention can also be used as, for example, an anti-inflammatory agent, or a prophylactic/therapeutic agent for diseases including, e.g., asthma, allergosis, inflammation, inflammatory eye diseases, Assison's disease, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, rheumatism, central nervous system damage (e.g., cerebrovascular diseases such as brain hemorrhage and brain infarction, head injury, cord injury, brain edema and multiple sclerosis), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and encephalopathy associated with AIDS), cerebral meningitis, diabetes mellitis, arthritis (e.g., arthritis rheumatoides, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, gouty arthritis and synovial inflammation), blood poisoning (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram-negative sepsis and toxic-shock syndrome), inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), inflammatory pulmonary diseases (e.g., chronic pneumonia, pulmonary silicosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis and lung tuberculosis), cachexia (e.g., infectious cachexia, canoerous cachexia and cachexia associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)), arterial sclerosis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, viral infection (e.g., viral infection by cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, herpes virus and the like), angina cordis, cardiac infarction, congestive failure, hepatitis, exaggerated immune response after medical transplantation, dialysis hypotension, diffuse intravascular coagulation syndrome, and immunodeficiency.\n\n\nWhere the antisense DNA or siRNA, for example is used, the antisense DNA or siRNA itself is administered as it is; or it is inserted into an appropriate vector such as retrovirus vector, adenovirus vector, adenovirus-associated virus vector, etc. and then administered in a conventional manner. The antisense DNA or siRNA of the present invention may also be administered as naked DNA, or with adjuvants to assist its uptake by gene gun or through a catheter such as a catheter with a hydrogel.\n\n\nFurther, the antisense DNA can also be used as a diagnostic oligonucleotide probe for examining the presence of the DNA of the present invention in tissues or cells or its expression.\n\n\n(9) Preparation of an Animal in which the DNA of the Present Invention has been Introduced\n\n\nThe present invention provides a non-human mammal having the DNA of the present invention, which is exogenous (hereinafter simply referred to as the exogenous DNA of the present invention) or its mutant DNA (sometimes simply referred to as the exogenous mutant DNA of the present invention).\n\n\nThus, the present invention provides:\n\n \n \n[1] A non-human mammal having the exogenous DNA of the present invention or its mutant DNA;\n \n[2] The mammal according to [1], wherein the non-human mammal is a rodent;\n \n[3] The mammal according to [2], wherein the rodent is a mouse or rat; and\n \n[4] A recombinant vector comprising the exogenous DNA of the present invention or its mutant DNA and capable of expression in a mammal.\n \n\n\nThe non-human mammal having the exogenous DNA of the present invention or its mutant DNA (hereinafter simply referred to as the DNA transgenic animal of the present invention) can be prepared by transfecting the desired DNA into an unfertilized egg, a fertilized egg, a spermatozoon, a germinal cell containing a primordial germinal cell thereof, or the like, preferably in the embryogenic stage in the development of a non-human mammal (more preferably in the single cell or fertilized cell stage and generally before the 8-cell phase) by standard means such as the calcium phosphate method, the electric pulse method, the lipofection method, the agglutination method, the microinjection method, the particle gun method, the DEAE-dextran method, etc. Also, it is possible to transfect the exogenous DNA of the present invention into a somatic cell, a living organ, a tissue cell or the like, by the DNA transfection methods, and utilize the transformant for cell culture, tissue culture, etc. In addition, these cells may be fused with the above-described germinal cell by a publicly known cell fusion method to prepare the transgenic animal of the present invention.\n\n\nExamples of the non-human mammal that can be used include bovine, swine, sheep, goat, rabbits, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, hamsters, mice, rats and the like. Above all, preferred are rodents, especially mice (e.g., C57BL/6 strain, DBA2 strain, etc. for a pure line and for a cross line, B6C3F\n1 \nstrain, BDF\n1 \nstrain, B6D2F\n1 \nstrain, BALB/c strain, ICR strain, etc.) or rats (Wistar, SD, etc.) and the like, since they are relatively short in ontogeny and life cycle from a standpoint of preparing model disease animals, and are easy in breeding.\n\n\n“Mammals” in a recombinant vector that can be expressed in mammals include human etc. in addition to the aforesaid non-human mammals.\n\n\nThe exogenous DNA of the present invention refers to the DNA of the present invention that is once isolated and extracted from mammals, not the DNA of the present invention inherently possessed by the non-human mammals.\n\n\nThe mutant DNA of the present invention includes mutants resulting from variation (e.g., mutation, etc.) in the base sequence of the original DNA of the present invention, specifically DNAs resulting from base addition, deletion, substitution with other bases, etc. and further including abnormal DNA.\n\n\nThe abnormal DNA is intended to mean the DNA that expresses abnormal FPRL1 of the present invention and exemplified by such a DNA that expresses FPRL1 suppressing the functions of normal FPRL1 of the present invention, or the like.\n\n\nThe exogenous DNA of the present invention may be any one of those derived from a mammal of the same species as, or a different species from, the mammal as the target animal. In transfecting the DNA of the present invention to the target animal, it is generally advantageous to use the DNA as a DNA construct in which the DNA is ligated downstream a promoter capable of expressing the DNA in the target animal. For example, in the case of transfecting the human DNA of the present invention, a DNA transgenic mammal that expresses the DNA of the present invention to a high level can be prepared by microinjecting a DNA construct (e.g., vector, etc.) ligated with the human DNA of the present invention into a fertilized egg of the target mammal, e.g., a fertilized egg of mouse, downstream the various promoters capable of expressing the DNA derived from various mammals (e.g., rabbits, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, hamsters, rats, mice, etc.) having the DNA of the present invention highly homologous to the human DNA.\n\n\nAs expression vectors for FPRL1 of the present invention, there are \nEscherichia coli\n-derived plasmids, \nBacillus subtilis\n-derived plasmids, yeast-derived plasmids, bacteriophages such as λ phage, etc., retroviruses such as Moloney leukemia virus, etc., animal viruses such as vaccinia virus, baculovirus, etc. Of these vectors, \nEscherichia coli\n-derived plasmids, \nBacillus subtilis\n-derived plasmids, yeast-derived plasmids, etc. are preferably used.\n\n\nExamples of these promoters for regulating the DNA expression include (i) promoters for DNA derived from viruses (e.g., simian virus, cytomegalovirus, Moloney leukemia virus, JC virus, breast cancer virus, poliovirus, etc.), and (ii) promoters derived from various mammals (human, rabbits, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, hamsters, rats, mice, etc.), for example, promoters of albumin, insulin II, uroplakin II, elastase, erythropoietin, endothelin, muscular creatine kinase, glial fibrillary acidic protein glutathione S-transferase, platelet-derived growth factor β, keratins K1, K10 and K14, collagen types I and II, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase βI subunit, dystrophin, tartarate-resistant alkaline phosphatase, atrial natriuretic factor, endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase (generally abbreviated as Tie2), sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphorylase (Na, K-ATPase), neurofilament light chain, metallothioneins I and IIA, metalloproteinase 1 tissue inhibitor, MHC class I antigen (H-2L), H-ras, renin, dopamine β-hydroxylase, thyroid peroxidase (TPO), polypeptide chain elongation factor 1α (EF-1α), β actin, α and β myosin heavy chains, myosin light chains 1 and 2, myelin base protein, thyroglobulins, Thy-1, immunoglobulins, H-chain variable region (VNP), serum amyloid component P, myoglobin, troponin C, smooth muscle α actin, preproencephalin A, vasopressin, etc. Among them, cytomegalovirus promoters, human peptide elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) promoters, human and chicken β actin promoters etc., which can achieve high expression in the whole body, are preferred.\n\n\nIt is preferred that the vectors described above have a sequence for terminating the transcription of the desired messenger RNA in the DNA transgenic animal (generally called a terminator); for example, a sequence of each DNA derived from viruses and various mammals. SV40 terminator of the simian virus, etc. is preferably used.\n\n\nIn addition, for the purpose of increasing the expression of the desired exogenous DNA to a higher level, the splicing signal and enhancer region of each DNA, a portion of the intron of an eukaryotic DNA may also be ligated at the 5′ upstream of the promoter region, or between the promoter region and the translational region, or at the 3′ downstream of the translational region, depending upon purposes.\n\n\nThe normal translational region of FPRL1 of the present invention can be prepared as the whole or a part of genomic DNA from DNA derived from liver, kidney, thyroid cells, fibroblasts etc. derived from humans or mammals (for example, rabbit, dog, cat, guinea pig, hamster, rat, mouse etc.) and a wide variety of commercial DNA libraries, or from complementary DNA as a starting material prepared by a known method from RNA derived from liver, kidney, thyroid cells, fibroblasts etc. As the extraneous abnormal DNA, a translational region can be prepared by point mutation of the normal translational region of FPRL1 obtained from the above cells or tissues.\n\n\nThe translational region can be prepared, as a DNA construct capable of being expressed in the transgenic animal, by a conventional DNA engineering technique, in which the DNA is ligated downstream from the aforesaid promoter and if desired, upstream from the translation termination site.\n\n\nThe exogenous DNA of the present invention is transfected at the fertilized egg cell stage in a manner such that the DNA is certainly present in all the germinal cells and somatic cells of the target mammal. The fact that the exogenous DNA of the present invention is present in the germinal cells of the animal prepared by DNA transfection means that all offspring of the prepared animal will maintain the exogenous DNA of the present invention in all of the germinal cells and somatic cells thereof. The offspring of the animal that inherits the exogenous DNA of the present invention also have the exogenous DNA of the present invention in all of the germinal cells and somatic cells thereof.\n\n\nThe non-human mammal, in which the normal exogenous DNA of the present invention has been transfected, can be passaged as the DNA-bearing animal under ordinary rearing environment, by confirming that the exogenous DNA is stably retained by mating.\n\n\nBy the transfection of the exogenous DNA of the present invention at the fertilized egg cell stage, the DNA is retained to be excess in all of the germinal and somatic cells of the target mammal. The fact that the exogenous DNA of the present invention is excessively present in the germinal cells of the prepared animal after transfection means that all of the offspring of the animal prepared have the exogenous DNA of the present invention excessively in all of the germinal cells and somatic cells thereof. The offspring of the animal of this kind that inherits the exogenous DNA of the present invention excessively have the DNA of the present invention in all of the germinal cells and somatic cells thereof.\n\n\nBy obtaining a homozygotic animal having the transfected DNA in both of homologous chromosomes and mating a male and female of the animal, all offspring can be passaged to excessively retain the DNA.\n\n\nIn a non-human mammal bearing the normal DNA of the present invention, the normal DNA of the present invention is expressed to a high level, and may eventually develop the hyperfunction of FPRL1 of the present invention by promoting the functions of endogenous normal DNA. Therefore, the animal can be utilized as a pathologic model animal for such a disease. Specifically, using the normal DNA transgenic animal of the present invention, it becomes possible to elucidate the hyperfunction of FPRL1 of the present invention and to clarify the pathological mechanism of the disease associated with FPRL1 of the present invention and to determine how to treat these diseases.\n\n\nFurthermore, since a mammal transfected with the exogenous normal DNA of the present invention exhibits an increasing symptom of FPRL1 of the present invention, the animal is usable for screening of therapeutic agents for the disease associated with FPRL1 of the present invention.\n\n\nOn the other hand, non-human mammal having the exogenous abnormal DNA of the present invention can be passaged under normal breeding conditions as the DNA-bearing animal by confirming the stable retaining of the exogenous DNA via crossing. In addition, the objective exogenous DNA can be utilized as a starting material by inserting the objective exogenous DNA into the plasmid described above. The DNA construct with a promoter can be prepared using conventional DNA engineering techniques. The transfection of the abnormal DNA of the present invention at the fertilized egg cell stage is preserved to be present in all of the germinal and somatic cells of the mammals to be targeted. The fact that the abnormal DNA of the present invention is present in the germinal cells of the animal after DNA transfection means that all of the offspring of the prepared animal have the abnormal DNA of the present invention in all of the germinal and somatic cells. The offspring of such an animal that inherits the exogenous DNA of the present invention has the abnormal DNA of the present invention in all the germinal and somatic cells. A homozygous animal having the introduced DNA on both of homologous chromosomes can be acquired and then by mating these male and female animals, all the offspring can be bred to have the DNA.\n\n\nSince the non-human mammal having the abnormal DNA of the present invention expresses the abnormal DNA of the present invention at a high level, the animal may cause the function inactive type inadaptability of FPRL1 of the present invention by inhibiting the functions of the endogenous normal DNA, and can be utilized as its disease model animal. For example, using the abnormal DNA-transferred animal of the present invention, it is possible to elucidate the mechanism of the function inactive type inadaptability of FPRL1 of the present invention and to study a method for treatment of this disease.\n\n\nIn its specific applicability, the transgenic animal of the present invention expressing the abnormal DNA of the present invention to a high level is also expected to serve as a model for the elucidation of the mechanism of the functional inhibition (dominant negative effect) of normal FPRL1 by abnormal FPRL1 of the present invention in the function inactive type inadaptability of FPRL1 of the present invention.\n\n\nA mammal bearing the abnormal exogenous DNA of the present invention is also expected to serve for screening a candidate drug for the treatment of the function inactive type inadaptability of FPRL1 of the present invention, since FPRL1 of the present invention is increased in such an animal.\n\n\nOther potential applications of two kinds of the DNA transgenic animals of the present invention described above further include:\n\n \n \n(1) Use as a cell source for tissue culture;\n \n(2) Elucidation of the relation to FPRL1 that is specifically expressed or activated by FPRL1 of the present invention, by direct analysis of DNA or RNA in tissues of the DNA transgenic animal of the present invention or by analysis of the FPRL1 tissues expressed by the DNA;\n \n(3) Research on the function of cells derived from tissues that are usually cultured only with difficulty, using cells in tissues bearing the DNA cultured by a standard tissue culture technique;\n \n(4) Screening a drug that enhances the functions of cells using the cells described in (3) above; and\n \n(5) Isolation and purification of mutant FPRL1 of the present invention and preparation of an antibody thereto.\n \n\n\nFurthermore, clinical conditions of a disease associated with FPRL1 of the present invention, including the function inactive type inadaptability to FPRL1 of the present invention, can be examined by using the DNA transgenic animal of the present invention. Also, pathological findings on each organ in a disease model associated with FPRL1 of the present invention can be obtained in more detail, leading to the development of a new method for treatment as well as the research and therapy of any secondary diseases associated with the disease.\n\n\nIt is also possible to obtain a free DNA-transfected cell by withdrawing each organ from the DNA transgenic animal of the present invention, mincing the organ and degrading with a proteinase such as trypsin, etc., followed by establishing the line of culturing or cultured cells. Furthermore, the DNA transgenic animal of the present invention can serve to identify cells capable of producing FPRL1 of the present invention, and to study in association with apoptosis, differentiation or propagation or on the mechanism of signal transduction in these properties to inspect any abnormality therein. Thus, the DNA transgenic animal can provide an effective research material for FPRL1 of the present invention and for investigation of the function and effect thereof.\n\n\nTo develop a drug for the treatment of diseases associated with FPRL1 or FPRL2 of the present invention, including the function inactive type inadaptability to FPRL1 of the present invention, using the DNA transgenic animal of the present invention, an effective and rapid method for screening a drug for the treatment of the diseases can be provided by using the method for inspection, the method for quantification etc. described above. It is also possible to investigate and develop a method for DNA therapy for the treatment of diseases associated with FPRL1 of the present invention, using the DNA transgenic animal of the present invention or a vector capable of expressing the exogenous DNA of the present invention.\n\n\n(10) Knockout Animal\n\n\nThe present invention provides a non-human mammalian embryonic stem cell bearing the DNA of the present invention inactivated and a non-human mammal deficient in expressing the DNA of the present invention.\n\n\nThus, the present invention provides:\n\n\n[1] A non-human mammalian embryonic stem cell in which the DNA of the present invention is inactivated;\n\n\n[2] The embryonic stem cell according to [1], wherein the DNA is inactivated by introducing a reporter gene (e.g., β-galactosidase gene derived from \nEscherichia coli\n);\n\n\n[3] The embryonic stem cell according to [1], which is resistant to neomycin;\n\n\n[4] The embryonic stem cell according to [1], wherein the non-human mammal is a rodent;\n\n\n[5] The embryonic stem cell according to [4], wherein the rodent is a mouse;\n\n\n[6] A non-human mammal deficient in expressing the DNA of the present invention, wherein the DNA of the present invention is inactivated;\n\n\n[7] The non-human mammal according to [6], wherein the DNA is inactivated by inserting a reporter gene (e.g., β-galactosidase derived from \nEscherichia coli\n), and the reporter gene is capable of being expressed under the control of a promoter for the DNA of the present invention;\n\n\n[8] The non-human mammal according to [6], which is a rodent;\n\n\n[9] The non-human mammal according to [8], wherein the rodent is a mouse; and\n\n\n[10] A method for screening a compound or its salt that promotes or inhibits the promoter activity for the DNA of the present invention, which comprises administering a test compound to the animal of [7] and detecting expression of the reporter gene.\n\n\nThe non-human mammalian embryonic stem cell, in which the DNA of the present invention is inactivated, refers to a non-human mammalian embryonic stem cell that suppresses the ability of the non-human mammalian to express the DNA by artificially mutating the DNA of the present invention possessed in the non-human mammal, or the DNA has no substantial ability to express FPRL1 of the present invention (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the knockout DNA of the present invention) by substantially inactivating the activities of FPRL1 of the present invention encoded by the DNA (hereinafter merely referred to as ES cell).\n\n\nAs the non-human mammalian, the same examples as described above apply.\n\n\nTechniques for artificially mutating the DNA of the present invention include deletion of a part or all of the DNA sequence and insertion of, or substitution with, other DNA, e.g., by genetic engineering. By these mutations, the knockout DNA of the present invention may be prepared, for example, by shifting the reading frame of a codon or by destroying the function of a promoter or exon.\n\n\nSpecifically, the non-human mammalian embryonic stem cell in which the DNA of the present invention is inactivated (hereinafter merely referred to as the ES cell with the DNA of the present invention inactivated or the knockout ES cell of the present invention) can be obtained by, for example, isolating the DNA of the present invention possessed by the target non-human mammal, inserting a DNA strand (hereinafter simply referred to as targeting vector) having a DNA sequence constructed so as to eventually destroy the gene by inserting into its exon site a chemical resistant gene such as a neomycin resistant gene or a hygromycin resistant gene, or a reporter gene such as lacZ (β-galactosidase gene) or cat (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene), etc. thereby destroying the functions of exon, or by inserting into the intron site between exons a DNA sequence which terminates gene transcription (e.g., polyA-added signal, etc.) thereby disabling the synthesis of complete messenger RNA, into a chromosome of the animal cells by, e.g., homologous recombination. The thus obtained ES cells are analyzed by the Southern hybridization using as a probe a DNA sequence on or near the DNA of the present invention, or by PCR using as primers a DNA sequence on the targeting vector and another DNA sequence near the DNA of the present invention which is not included in the targeting vector, and the knockout ES cell of the present invention is selected.\n\n\nThe parent ES cells to inactivate the DNA of the present invention by homologous recombination, etc. may be of a strain already established as described above, or may be originally established in accordance with a modification of the known method by Evans and Kaufman. For example, in the case of mouse ES cells, currently it is common practice to use ES cells of the 129 strain. However, since their immunological background is obscure, the C57BL/6 mouse or the BDF\n1 \nmouse (F\n1 \nhybrid between C57BL/6 and DBA/2), wherein the low ovum collection per C57BL/6 mouse or C57BL/6 has been improved by crossing with DBA/2, may be preferably used, instead of obtaining a pure line of ES cells with the clear immunological genetic background. The BDF\n1 \nmouse is advantageous in that when a pathologic model mouse is generated using ES cells obtained therefrom, the genetic background can be changed to that of the C57BL/6 mouse by back-crossing with the C57BL/6 mouse, since its background is of the C57BL/6 mouse, as well as being advantageous in that ovum availability per animal is high and ova are robust.\n\n\nIn establishing ES cells, blastocytes of 3.5 days after fertilization are commonly used. A large number of early stage embryos may be acquired more efficiently by collecting the embryos of the 8-cell stage and using the same after culturing until the blastocyte stage.\n\n\nAlthough the ES cells used may be of either sex, male ES cells are generally more convenient for generation of a germ cell line chimera and are therefore preferred. It is desirable to identify sexes as soon as possible also in order to save painstaking culture time.\n\n\nAs an example of the method for sex identification of the ES cell, mention may be made of a method in which a gene in the sex-determining region on the Y-chromosome is amplified by PCR and detected. When this method is used, ES cells (about 50 cells) corresponding to almost 1 colony are sufficient, whereas karyotype analysis hitherto required about 10\n6 \ncells; therefore, the first selection of ES cells at the early stage of culture can be based on sex identification, and male cells can be selected early, which saves a significant amount of time at the early stage of culture.\n\n\nSecond selection can be achieved by, for example, chromosome number confirmation by the G-banding method. It is usually desirable that the chromosome number of the obtained ES cells be 100% of the normal number. However, when it is difficult to obtain the cells having the normal number of chromosomes due to physical operation etc. in cell establishment, it is desirable that the ES cell be again cloned to a normal cell (e.g., in mouse cells having the number of chromosomes being 2n=40) after the gene of the ES cells is rendered knockout.\n\n\nAlthough the embryonic stem cell line thus obtained shows a very high growth potential, it must be subcultured with great care, since it tends to lose its ontogenic capability. For example, the embryonic stem cell line is cultured at about 37° C. in a carbon dioxide incubator (preferably about 5% carbon dioxide and about 95% air, or about 5% oxygen, about 5% carbon dioxide and about 90% air) in the presence of LIF (1-10000 U/ml) on appropriate feeder cells such as STO fibroblasts, treated with a trypsin/EDTA solution (normally about 0.001 to about 0.5% trypsin/about 0.1 to 5 mM EDTA, preferably about 0.1% trypsin/about 1 mM EDTA) at the time of passage to obtain separate single cells, which are then seeded on freshly prepared feeder cells. This passage is normally conducted every 1 to 3 days; it is desirable that cells be observed at passage and cells found to be morphologically abnormal in culture, if any, be abandoned.\n\n\nBy allowing ES cells to reach a high density in mono-layers or to form cell aggregates in suspension under appropriate conditions, it is possible to differentiate them to various cell types, for example, parietal and visceral muscles, cardiac muscle or the like [M. J. Evans and M. H. Kaufman, Nature, 292, 154, 1981; G. R. Martin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 78, 7634, 1981; T. C. Doetschman et al., Journal of Embryology Experimental Morphology, 87, 27, 1985]. The cells deficient in expression of the DNA of the present invention, which are obtainable from the differentiated ES cells of the present invention, are useful for studying the functions of FPRL1 of the present invention or FPRL1 of the present invention in vitro cytologically or molecular biologically.\n\n\nThe non-human mammal deficient in expression of the DNA of the present invention can be identified from a normal animal by measuring the amount of mRNA in the subject animal by a publicly known method, and indirectly comparing the levels of expression.\n\n\nAs the non-human mammal, the same examples supra apply.\n\n\nWith respect to the non-human mammal deficient in expression of the DNA of the present invention, the DNA of the present invention can be made knockout by transfecting a targeting vector, prepared as described above, to mouse embryonic stem cells or mouse oocytes thereof, and conducting homologous recombination in which a targeting vector DNA sequence, wherein the DNA of the present invention is inactivated by the transfection, is replaced with the DNA of the present invention on a chromosome of a mouse embryonic stem cell or mouse oocyte.\n\n\nThe cells with the DNA of the present invention in which the DNA of the present invention is rendered knockout can be identified by the Southern hybridization analysis using as a probe a DNA sequence on or near the DNA of the present invention, or by PCR analysis using as primers a DNA sequence on the targeting vector and another DNA sequence which is not included in the DNA of the present invention derived from mouse, which is used as the targeting vector. When non-human mammalian embryonic stem cells are used, the cell line wherein the DNA of the present invention is inactivated is cloned by homologous recombination; the resulting cloned cell line is injected to, e.g., a non-human mammalian embryo or blastocyte, at an appropriate stage such as the 8-cell stage. The resulting chimeric embryos are transplanted to the uterus of the pseudo-pregnant non-human mammal. The resulting animal is a chimeric animal composed of both cells having the normal locus of the DNA of the present invention and those having an artificially mutated locus of the DNA of the present invention.\n\n\nWhen some germ cells of the chimeric animal have a mutated locus of the DNA of the present invention, an individual in which all tissues are composed of cells having an artificially mutated locus of the DNA of the present invention can be selected from a series of offspring obtained by crossing between such a chimeric animal and a normal animal, e.g., by coat color identification, etc. The individuals thus obtained are normally deficient in heterozygous expression of FPRL1 of the present invention. The individuals deficient in homozygous expression of FPRL1 of the present invention can be obtained from offspring of the intercross between the heterozygotes.\n\n\nWhen an oocyte is used, a DNA solution may be injected, e.g., to the prenucleus by microinjection thereby obtaining a transgenic non-human mammal having a targeting vector introduced into its chromosome. From such transgenic non-human mammals, those having a mutation at the locus of the DNA of the present invention can be obtained by selection based on homologous recombination.\n\n\nAs described above, individuals wherein the DNA of the present invention is rendered knockout permit passage rearing under ordinary rearing conditions, after it is confirmed that in the animal individuals obtained by their crossing, the DNA has been knockout.\n\n\nFurthermore, the genital system may be obtained and maintained by conventional methods. That is, by crossing male and female animals each having the inactivated DNA, homozygote animals having the inactivated DNA in both loci can be obtained. The homozygotes thus obtained may be reared so that one normal animal and two or more homozygotes are produced from a mother animal to efficiently obtain such homozygotes. By crossing male and female heterozygotes, homozygotes and heterozygotes having the inactivated DNA are proliferated and passaged.\n\n\nThe non-human mammalian embryonic stem cell, in which the DNA of the present invention is inactivated, is very useful for preparing a non-human mammal deficient in expression of the DNA of the present invention.\n\n\nSince the non-human mammal, in which the DNA of the present invention fails to express, lacks various biological activities induced by FPRL1 of the present invention, such an animal can be a disease model suspected of inactivated biological activities of FPRL1 of the present invention and thus, offers an effective study to investigate causes for and therapy for these diseases.\n\n\n(10a) Method for Screening a Compound or a Salt Thereof Having Therapeutic/Prophylactic Effects for Diseases Caused by Deficiency, Damages, etc. of the DNA of the Present Invention\n\n\nThe non-human mammal deficient in expression of the DNA of the present invention can be used to screen a compound or a salt thereof having therapeutic/prophylactic effects for diseases caused by deficiency, damages, etc. of the DNA of the present invention.\n\n\nThat is, the present invention provides a method for screening of a compound or its salt having therapeutic/prophylactic effects for diseases caused by deficiency, damages, etc. of the DNA of the present invention, which comprises administering a test compound to the non-human mammal deficient in expression of the DNA of the present invention, and observing and measuring a change having occurred in the animal.\n\n\nAs the non-human mammal deficient in expression of the DNA of the present invention used for the screening method, the same examples as given hereinabove apply.\n\n\nExamples of the test compounds include peptides, proteins, non-peptide compounds, synthetic compounds, fermentation products, cell extracts, plant extracts, animal tissue extracts, blood plasma, etc., and these compounds may be novel compounds or publicly known compounds.\n\n\nThe test compounds may form salts, and as salts of the test compounds, use is made of salts with physiologically acceptable acids (e.g., inorganic acids etc.) or bases (e.g., organic acids etc.), preferably physiologically acceptable acid addition salts. Examples of such salts are salts with inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid etc.), salts with organic acids (e.g., acetic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, benzoic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid etc.) and the like.\n\n\nSpecifically, the non-human mammal deficient in the expression of the DNA of the present invention is treated with a test compound, comparison is made with an intact animal for control and a change in each organ, tissue, disease conditions, etc. of the animal is used as an indicator to assess the therapeutic/prophylactic effects of the test compound.\n\n\nFor treating an animal to be tested with a test compound, for example, oral administration, intravenous injection, etc. are applied and the treatment is appropriately selected depending upon conditions of the test animal, properties of the test compound, etc. Furthermore, the amount of a test compound administered can be appropriately selected depending on administration route, nature of the test compound, or the like.\n\n\nIn the screening method, when the Alzheimer's disease symptom of a test animal is ameliorated by about 10% or more, preferably about 30% or more, more preferably about 50% or more by administering a test compound to the test animal, the test compound can be selected as a compound or its salt that has therapeutic/prophylactic effects on the disease.\n\n\nThe compound or its salt obtained by the screening method is a compound or its salt selected from the aforementioned test compounds, and can be used as, for example, a cell migration irritant (or a cell migration accelerator) or an anti-inflammatory agent, further a medicament such as a safe and low toxic prophylactic/therapeutic agent for diseases caused by deficiency in or damage to FPRL1 of the present invention (for example, diseases involving asthma, allergosis, inflammation, inflammatory eye diseases, Assison's disease, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, rheumatism, central nervous system damage (e.g., cerebrovascular diseases such as brain hemorrhage and brain infarction, head injury, cord injury, brain edema and multiple sclerosis), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and encephalopathy associated with AIDS), cerebral meningitis, diabetes mellitis, arthritis (e.g., arthritis rheumatoides, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, gouty arthritis and synovial inflammation), blood poisoning (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram-negative sepsis and toxic-shock syndrome), inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), inflammatory pulmonary diseases (e.g., chronic pneumonia, pulmonary silicosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis and lung tuberculosis), cachexia (e.g., infectious cachexia, canoerous cachexia and cachexia associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)), arterial sclerosis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, viral infection (e.g., viral infection by cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, herpes virus and the like), angina cordis, cardiac infarction, congestive failure, hepatitis, exaggerated immune response after medical transplantation, dialysis hypotension, diffuse intravascular coagulation syndrome, and immunodeficiency.) Further, a compound derived from the compound obtained by the screening can also be similarly used.\n\n\nThe compound obtained by the screening method may form a salt, and as the salts of the compound, there may be used salts with physiologically acceptable acids (e.g., inorganic acids or organic acids) or bases (e.g., alkali metals), preferably physiologically acceptable acid addition salts. Examples of such salts are salts with inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid), salts with organic acids (e.g., acetic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, benzoic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid) and the like.\n\n\nA medicament comprising the compound or salts thereof obtained by the above screening method may be manufactured in a manner similar to the above-described method for preparing the medicament comprising the compound or a salt thereof changing the binding property or signal transduction between FPRL1 of the present invention and FPRL1 ligand.\n\n\nSince the pharmaceutical preparation thus obtained is safe and low toxic, it can be administered to humans or mammals (e.g., rat, mouse, guinea pig, rabbit, sheep, swine, bovine, horse, cat, dog, monkey, etc.)\n\n\nThe dose of the above compound or its salt may vary depending on target disease, subject to be administered, route for administration, etc. When the compound is orally administered, the compound is administered to a patient with inflammation (as 60 kg) generally in a daily dose of approximately 0.1 to 100 mg, preferably approximately 1.0 mg to 50 mg, more preferably approximately 1.0 to 20 mg. When the compound is parenterally administered, a single dose of the compound may vary depending on subject to be administered, target disease, etc. When the compound is administered in the form of an injection to a patient with inflammation (as 60 kg), it is convenient to administer the compound by intravenous injection generally in a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to 30 mg, preferably approximately 0.1 to 20 mg, more preferably approximately 0.1 to 10 mg. For other animal species, the corresponding dose as converted per 60 kg weight can be administered.\n\n\n(10b) Method of Screening a Compound that Promotes or Inhibits the Activities of a Promoter for the DNA of the Present Invention\n\n\nThe present invention provides a method of screening a compound or its salt that promotes or inhibits the activities of a promoter for the DNA of the present invention, which comprises administering a test compound to a non-human mammal deficient in expression of the DNA of the present invention and detecting expression of the reporter gene.\n\n\nIn the screening method described above, the non-human mammal deficient in expression of the DNA of the present invention is selected from the aforesaid non-human mammals deficient in expression of the DNA of the present invention in which the DNA of the present invention is inactivated by introducing a reporter gene and the reporter gene can be expressed under the control of a promoter for the DNA of the present invention.\n\n\nThe same examples given above for the test compound, apply to the test compound.\n\n\nAs the reporter gene, the same specific examples given above apply to the reporter gene, with β-galactosidase (lacZ), soluble alkaline phosphatase gene, luciferase gene, etc. being preferred.\n\n\nIn the non-human mammal deficient in expression of the DNA of the present invention wherein the DNA of the present invention is replaced by a reporter gene, the reporter gene is present under the control of a promoter for the DNA of the present invention. Thus, the activity of the promoter can be detected by tracing the expression of a substance encoded by the reporter gene.\n\n\nFor example, when a part of the DNA region encoding FPRL1 of the present invention is replaced by, e.g., β-galactosidase gene (lacZ) derived from \nEscherichia coli\n, β-galactosidase is expressed in a tissue where FPRL1 of the present invention should originally be expressed, in place of FPRL1 of the present invention. Thus, the expression state of FPRL1 of the present invention can be readily observed in vivo in an animal, by staining with a reagent, e.g., 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactopyranoside (X-gal), which is a substrate for β-galactosidase. Specifically, a mouse deficient in FPRL1 of the present invention, or its tissue section, is fixed with glutaraldehyde, etc. After washing with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), the system is reacted with a staining solution containing X-gal at room temperature or about 37° C. for approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour. After the β-galactosidase reaction is terminated by washing the tissue preparation with 1 mM EDTA/PBS solution, the color formed is observed. Alternatively, mRNA encoding lacZ may be detected in a conventional manner.\n\n\nThe compound or salts thereof obtained using the screening methods supra are compounds (or their salts) selected from the test compounds described above, which promote or inhibit the promoter activity for the DNA of the present invention.\n\n\nAs the salts of the compounds obtained by the screening methods, use is made of salts with physiologically acceptable acids (e.g., inorganic acids) or bases (e.g., organic acids), and physiologically acceptable acid addition salts are preferred. Examples of such salts are salts with inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid), salts with organic acids (e.g., acetic acid, formic acid, propionic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, benzoic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid) and the like.\n\n\nThe compound or its salt that promotes the promoter activity for the DNA of the present invention can promote the expression of FPRL1 of the present invention to promote the functions of FPRL1, and can thus be used as a low-toxic and safe medicament such as a prophylactic/therapeutic agent for diseases associated with dysfunction of FPRL1 of the present invention. Specifically, the compound or its salt can be used as, for example, a cell migration irritant (or a cell migration accelerator), or an anti-inflammatory agent, further a prophylactic/therapeutic agent for diseases involving asthma, allergosis, inflammation, inflammatory eye diseases, Assison's disease, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, rheumatism, central nervous system damage (e.g., cerebrovascular diseases such as brain hemorrhage and brain infarction, head injury, cord injury, brain edema and multiple sclerosis), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and encephalopathy associated with AIDS), cerebral meningitis, diabetes mellitis, arthritis (e.g., arthritis rheumatoides, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, gouty arthritis and synovial inflammation), blood poisoning (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram-negative sepsis and toxic-shock syndrome), inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), inflammatory pulmonary diseases (e.g., chronic pneumonia, pulmonary silicosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis and lung tuberculosis), cachexia (e.g., infectious cachexia, canoerous cachexia and cachexia associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)), arterial sclerosis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, viral infection (e.g., viral infection by cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, herpes virus and the like), angina cordis, cardiac infarction, congestive failure, hepatitis, exaggerated immune response after medical transplantation, dialysis hypotension, diffuse intravascular coagulation syndrome, and immunodeficiency.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the compound or its salt that inhibits the promoter activity for the DNA of the present invention can inhibit the expression of FPRL1 of the present invention to inhibit the functions of FPRL1, and is thus useful as a cell migration depressant, further a low-toxic and safe medicament such as a prophylactic/therapeutic agent for diseases associated with over-expression of FPRL1 of the present invention (e.g., infectious disease).\n\n\nIn addition, the compound or its salt that inhibits the promoter activity for the DNA of the present invention can be used as an anti-inflammatory agent, further a prophylactic/therapeutic agent for asthma, allergosis, inflammation, inflammatory eye diseases, Assison's disease, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, rheumatism, central nervous system damage (e.g., cerebrovascular diseases such as brain hemorrhage and brain infarction, head injury, cord injury, brain edema and multiple sclerosis), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and encephalopathy associated with AIDS), cerebral meningitis, diabetes mellitis, arthritis (e.g., arthritis rheumatoides, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, gouty arthritis and synovial inflammation), blood poisoning (e.g., sepsis, septic shock, endotoxic shock, gram-negative sepsis and toxic-shock syndrome), inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), inflammatory pulmonary diseases (e.g., chronic pneumonia, pulmonary silicosis, pulmonary sarcoidosis and lung tuberculosis), cachexia (e.g., infectious cachexia, canoerous cachexia and cachexia associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)), arterial sclerosis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, viral infection (e.g., viral infection by cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, herpes virus and the like), angina cordis, cardiac infarction, congestive failure, hepatitis, exaggerated immune response after medical transplantation, dialysis hypotension, diffuse intravascular coagulation syndrome, and immunodeficiency.\n\n\nFurther, a compound derived from the compound obtained in the above screening can also be used similarly.\n\n\nThe medicament comprising the compound or its salt obtained by the screening method can be produced in a manner similar to the method for preparing the medicament comprising the compound or a salt thereof changing the binding property between FPRL1 of the present invention or a salt thereof and FPRL1 ligand described hereinabove.\n\n\nThe thus obtained pharmaceutical preparation is safe and low toxic, and can thus be administered to, for example, human and mammals (e.g., rat, mouse, guinea pig, rabbit, sheep, swine, bovine, horse, cat, dog, monkey, etc.)\n\n\nThe dose of the compound or its salt may vary depending on target disease, subject to be administered, route for administration, etc. When the compound promoting the promoter activity for the DNA of the present invention is orally administered, the compound is administered to a patient with inflammation (as 60 kg) generally in a daily dose of approximately 0.1 to 100 mg, preferably approximately 1.0 mg to 50 mg, more preferably approximately 1.0 to 20 mg. When the compound is parenterally administered, a single dose of the compound may vary depending on subject to be administered, target disease, etc. When the compound (or its salt) promoting the promoter activity for the DNA of the present invention is administered in the form of an injection to a patient with inflammation (as 60 kg), it is convenient to administer the compound or its salt by intravenous injection in a daily dose of approximately 0.01 to 30 mg, preferably approximately 0.1 to 20 mg, more preferably approximately 0.1 to 10 mg. For other animal species, the corresponding doses as converted per 60 kg weight can be administered.\n\n\nThus, the non-human mammal deficient in expression of the DNA of the present invention is extremely useful in screening a compound or its salt that promotes or inhibits the activity of a promoter for the DNA of the present invention, and can contribute significantly to elucidation of causes for various diseases attributable to deficient expression of the DNA of the present invention or development of a prophylactic/therapeutic agent for the diseases.\n\n\nFurther, genes encoding various proteins are ligated downstream from DNA containing a promoter region for FPRL1 of the present invention and injected into a fertilized egg of an animal to create a transgenic animal by which FPRL1 of the present invention can be specifically synthesized and examined for its action in the living body. When a suitable reporter gene is ligated to the promoter region to establish a cell strain expressing the same, the cell strain can be used as a system of searching for a low-molecular-weight compound having an action of specifically promoting or suppressing the ability of the cell strain to produce FPRL1 of the present invention in vivo.\n\n\nIn the specification and drawings, the codes of bases and amino acids are denoted in accordance with the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature or by the common codes in the art, examples of which are shown below.

\nCentral\n 6, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8566, Japan, as the Accession Number FERM BP-8274 on Jan. 10, 2003.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nHereinafter, the present invention is described in more detail by reference to the Reference Examples and the Examples, which however are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. The gene manipulation procedures using \nEscherichia coli \nwere performed according to the methods described in the Molecular Cloning.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nReduction of a Level of Intracellular cAMP, Which Has Been Increased by Addition of Forskolin, by Fraction of Porcine Stomach Extract in human FPRL1-GFP Expressing CHO Cells\n\n\nHuman FPRL1-GFP expressing CHO cells were washed with assay medium (HBSS (GibcoBRL) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2 mM IBMX). Then the cells were incubated at 37° C. for 30 minutes under 5% CO\n2\n. Each concentration of fraction of porcine stomach (0.05 g/well and 0.5 g/well) diluted with assay medium was added to the cells, followed by addition of forskolin to be 1 μM. The mixture was incubated at 37° C. for 30 minutes under 5% CO\n2\n. After discarding culture supernatant, in accordance with the protocol of cAMP screen kit (Applied Biosystems), a level of intracellular cAMP was measured using plate reader (ARVO sx multilabel counter, Wallac).\n\n\nAs a result, when it is compared to CHO cells (mock), in which a vector was solely introduced, dose dependent- and specific- reduction of a level of intracellular cAMP, which had been increased by addition of forskolin, by fraction of porcine stomach extract (0.05 g/well and 0.5 g/well) was specifically detected for CHO cells, in which FPRL1-GFP gene was introduced (\nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nPurification of Intrinsic FPRL1 Ligand P3 From Porcine Stomach\n\n\nHuman FPRL1-GFP expressing CHO cell-specific inhibiting activity for intracellular cAMP production, which is found in Example 1, was purified from crude peptide fraction of porcine stomach.\n\n\nFirstly, 4 kg of porcine stomach was boiled in 8 L of milliQ water and after addition of acetic acid to be 1 M, homogenized by Polytoron. After stirring for overnight, a supernatant was obtained by centrifugation. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to the supernatant to be 0.05%, and the supernatant was applied to C18 column (Prep C18 125A; Waters). Peptide bound to the column was eluted by stepwise method of 30% and 50% acetonitrile containing 0.5% TFA. Fraction at 30% acetonitrile was diluted with two volume of 20 mM ammonium acetate (pH4.7) and was applied to ion-exchange column HiPrep CM-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia). Peptide bound to ion-exchange column was eluted with a gradient of 0-1.0 M NaCl in 20 mM ammonium acetate (pH4.7) containing 10% acetonitrile. To the fractions at 0.1-0.2 M NaCl, in which most of human FPRL1-GFP expressing CHO cell-specific inhibiting activity for intracellular cAMP production was contained, three volume of cold acetone was added. After discarding precipitates by centrifugation, a supernatant was concentrated by evaporation. To the concentrated supernatant, TFA was added to be 0.1%. Subsequently, further isolation was carried out with reverse phase HPLC column SOURCE 15RPC 20 ml (Pharmacia). Isolation using RESOURCE RPC was done with a gradient of 10% to 30% acetonitrile. Human FPRL1-GFP expressing CHO cell-specific inhibiting activity for intracellular cAMP production was eluted with multiple peaks. Among them, fraction at 26% acetonitrile was isolated using YMC-Pack Pro C18 column. Isolation using YMC-Pack Pro C18 column was performed with a gradient of 22% to 26% acetonitrile. Active fraction was eluted at the concentration of 24% acetonitrile. Further, this active fraction was applied to cation-exchange column TSK gel CM-SW (TOSO) and eluted with a gradient of 0 to 0.5 M NaCl in 20 mM ammonium acetate (pH4.7) containing 10% acetonitrile. Major activity was eluted at the concentration of 0.2 M NaCl. To the active fraction of CM-2SW column, TFA was added to be 0.1%. Final purification with reverse phase column diphenyl 219TP52 (Vydac) was done using a gradient of 20% to 22% acetonitrile. As a result, single peak coincident with human FPRL1-GFP expressing CHO cell-specific inhibiting activity for intracellular cAMP production was obtained (\nFIG. 2\n).\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nMass Spectrometry for Porcine Intrinsic FPRL1 Ligand P3\n\n\nWhen porcine intrinsic FPRL1 ligand P3 fraction purified in Example 2 was analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorbtion ionization time of flight mass spectrometry using Voyager-DE PRO (ABI) (\nFIG. 3\n), m/z 1724.8, 1741.6, 1772.7 was obtained.\n\n\nThen FPRL1 ligand P3 fraction was examined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using Q-Tof Ultima API (Micromass) and analyzed by analysis software MassLynx attached to the above equipment. In raw data (\nFIG. 4\n), which shows a mixture of polyvalent ion, trivalent ion m/z 575.30, 580.64 was mainly appeared. When these values were converted to monovalent ion by treatment of “\nMaxEnt\n 3”, one of MassLynx functions (data not shown), m/z 1723.88 and m/z 1739.89 were obtained. From these results, it was considered that molecular-associated ion (M+H\n+\n) of FPRL1 ligand is m/z 1723.88, and m/z 1739.89 is an oxidant of m/z 1723.88.\n\n\nNext, using Q-Tof Ultima API, MS/MS measurement was performed. When it was measured using m/z 575.3, 580.6 as a parent ion, in both spectrums, many fragment ion was appeared in common. Due to ease of analysis, the spectrum measured using trivalent ion m/z 580.6 of oxidant as a parent ion was treated with MaxEnt 3 (\nFIG. 5\n). From the result, a sequence analysis was carried out. Based on the result, a search of database was done. Subsequently, it was deduced that the sequence of the substance is 13 residues at the N-terminus of N-formylated porcine cytochrome c oxidase.

After stirring for overnight, a supernatant was obtained by centrifugation. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to the supernatant to be 0.05%, and the supernatant was applied to C18 column (Prep C18 125A; Waters). Peptide bound to the column was eluted by stepwise method of 30% and 50% acetonitrile containing 0.5% TFA. Fraction at 30% acetonitrile was diluted with two volume of 20 mM ammonium acetate (pH4.7) and was applied to ion-exchange column HiPrep CM-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia). Peptide bound to ion-exchange column was eluted with a gradient of 0-1.0 M NaCl in 20 mM ammonium acetate (pH4.7) containing 10% acetonitrile. To the fractions at 0.1-0.2 M NaCl, in which most of human FPRL1-GFP expressing CHO cell-specific inhibiting activity for intracellular cAMP production was contained, three volume of cold acetone was added. After discarding precipitates by centrifugation, a supernatant was concentrated by evaporation. To the concentrated supernatant, TFA was added to be 0.1%. Subsequently, further isolation was carried out with reverse phase HPLC column SOURCE 15RPC 20 ml (Pharmacia). Isolation using RESOURCE RPC was done with a gradient of 10% to 30% acetonitrile.

That is, 35 μl of FPRL1 ligand \nP4 fraction #\n40 was collected, and fraction volume was reduced with SAVANT. To the fraction, 100 μl of 25% TFA-water was added, and a reaction was performed at 55° C. for two hours. Then, after reducing the volume with SAVANT, a sequence of the N-terminus was analyzed for all samples (\nFIG. 19\n). As a result, a sequence for 13 amino acid residues following Met at first position of the deduced structure was confirmed.\n\n\nExample 14\n\n\nCompetitive Inhibition Test for Human FPRL1\n\n\nBy the lactoperoxidase method, \n125\nI-labeled porcine FPRL ligand P3 (pfCYOX-1(1-13)) and human FPRL ligand P3 (hfCYOX-1(1-13)), wherein both were synthesized in Peptide Institute, Inc., were prepared. To 20 μl of 0.1 mM peptide solution, 20 μl of 10 μg/ml lactoperoxidase (Sigma) dissolved in 0.1 M HEPES-NaOH/pH7.0, 20 μl of Iodine-125 (Amersham, IMS-30, 74 MBq) and 20 μl of 6000-fold diluted 30% hydrogen peroxide solution (Wako Pure Chemicals) were added. After mixing with Vortexmixer, the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. By adding 600 μl of distilled water containing 0.1% TFA, the reaction was terminated. Then, by reverse phase HPLC using TSKgel ODS-80TM CTR 4.6×100 mm column, a peak of labeled form, which was produced by the reaction, was fractionated. The fraction was mixed with an equal volume of assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl/pH7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 20 μg/ml leupeptine, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 4 μg/ml E-64 (Peptide Institute), and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and stored at −30° C. until use.\n\n\nHuman FPRL1-expressing CHO cells (No. 8) were cultivated, collected using PBS containing 5 mM EDTA from culture vessel, and suspended in assay buffer containing no bovine serum albumin, which is described above. Homogenization using Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica) at 18,000 rpm for 40 seconds was performed three times. After centrifugation (1000×g, 4° C., 10 minutes), supernatant was recovered. To precipitation, the same operation was repeated and supernatant was recovered again. Then, by the centrifugation (100,000×g, 4° C., 1 hour), precipitation (membrane fraction) was recovered. The membrane fraction was re-suspended in a small amount of buffer, homogenized using Tefron homogenizer, and stored at −80° C. until use.\n\n\nCompetitive inhibition test was carried out under the following conditions. In 96-well polypropyrene plate, 200 μl of solution containing 0.25 μg of the membrane fraction, 25 pM (final concentration) \n125\nI-labeled compound, a test sample and assay buffer were prepared and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. For determining a level of non-specific binding, 1 μM non-labeled compound instead of a test sample in the well was used for assay. After completion of incubation, The membrane fraction was isolated using cell harvester corresponding to 96-well (Packard) and filter unit (GF/C, Packard) treated with polyethyleneimine (Wako Pure Chemicals), and trapped on the filter. After completely drying the filter, Microcinti 0 (Packard) was added to the filter, and a level of labeled form co-trapped with the membrane fraction on the filter was measured using Topcount (Pakard). Non-specific binding level was subtracted from each measured value. Then the ratio of reduced binding level by addition of test sample to the well with notest sample (total binding level), that is, the inhibition rate was calculated. Further, from dosage of test sample-inhibition curve, IC\n50 \nwas calculated (Table 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSample\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npfCYOX-1(1-13)\n\n\n0.15 ± 0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhfCYOX-1(1-13)\n\n\n 1.1 ± 0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 15\n\n\nPurification of Intrinsic FPRL1 Ligand P4 from Porcine Stomach\n\n\nHuman FPRL1-GFP expressing CHO cell-specific inhibiting activity for intracellular cAMP production, which is found in Example 1, was purified from crude peptide fraction of porcine stomach.\n\n\nFirstly, 14 kg of porcine stomach was boiled in 28 L of milliQ water and after addition of acetic acid to be 1 M, homogenized by Polytoron.

For assay of intracellular transition of the protein, the cells at growth phase was seeded at the concentration of 40000 cells/well on 96-well plate (Packard, View-Plate™-96, Black), and cultured for overnight at 37° C. under 5% CO\n2\n. Firstly, the cells into the well were washed with assay buffer (HBSS (GibcoBRL) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)). Then, 100 μl of the assay buffer containing a test sample were added to the well and incubated at 37° C. under 5% CO\n2 \nfor one hour. Subsequently, 100 μl/well of cell fixation solution (PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (Ca/Mg free)) were added to the well and stood at room temperature for 30 minutes. After removing the cell fixation solution and washing the cells with Ca/Mg free PBS, a labeling solution (3.13 μg/ml of wheat germ aggulutinin (Molecular Probe, W-849) and 5 μg/ml of Hoechst-containing Ca/Mg free PBS) was added (50 μl/well) and stood at room temperature for 20 minutes. After removing the labeling solution, the cells were washed with Ca/Mg free PBS (200 μl/well) to replace the same (200 μl/well). Then the surface of the plate was sealed, and immediately analysis using Cellomics ArrayScan System (Cellomics) was carried out. Estimation for intracellular localization of FPRL1-GFP fusion protein was optimized according to GPCR Signaling assay Protocol attached to the above system, and done using MemCyto Above Threshold (cell ratio (unit %) over specific parameter (MemCyto Intensity Ratio) representing the ratio of membrane/cytoplasmic localization of the protein to all cells in the well).\n\n\nAs a result, when formylated peptide (porcine FPRL ligand P3 (pfCYOX-1(1-13)) and human FPRL ligand P3 (hfCYOX-1(1-13))) was added, concentration-dependent transition of FPRL1-GFP protein from cell membrane to cytoplasm, that is, induction of internalization (decrease of value for MemCyto Above Threshold) was detected.\n\n\nExample 19\n\n\nCell Migration Stimulating Activity of Formylated Peptide (Porcine FPRL Ligand P3 (pfCYOX-1(1-13)) and Human FPRL Ligand P3 (hfCYOX-1(1-13))) to FPRL1-GFP Fusion Protein-Expressing CHO Cells\n\n\nUsing FPRL1-GFP fusion protein-expressing CHO cells, which are described in Example 18, a cell migration activity of the above cells by stimulation using formylated peptide was investigated.\n\n\nThe 96-well disposable chemotaxis chamber (ChemoTx-96, Neuro Probe) was used for assay. Firstly, to bottom well of the chamber, a test sample diluted with DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 0.5% BSA was added. Then, a polycarbonate filter, which is precoated with 10 μg/ml bovine fibronectin (Yagai) on both sides, was fixed on the chamber, and contacted with the test sample. Next, suspension for FPRL1-GFP fusion protein-expressing CHO cells was put onto the filter at 96-well site as a droplet. The chamber was covered, and cultured at 37° C. for 4 hours under conditions of 5% CO\n2\n. The cell suspension was prepared as follows: the aforementioned CHO cells at growth phase, which had been precultured in 150 cm\n2 \nflask for culture, were peal off using trypsin/EDTA; the cell suspension obtained was centrifuged to get cell precipitation; and after washing with PBS once, the cells were resuspended in DMEM medium containing 0.5% BSA at the concentration of 3.6×10\n6 \ncells/ml. The cells were cultivated on the chamber, and then after removing non-migrating cells present onto the filter, the cells migrated underneath the filter were fixed and stained according to the protocol of accompanying instructions using Diff-Quick (International Reagents Corporation). The filter other than the underside was sufficiently washed and air-dried. For this filter, absorbance at 595 nm was measured using microplate reader. As a result, porcine FPRL ligand P3 (pfCYOX-1(1-13)) and human FPRL ligand P3 (hfCYOX-1(1-13)) exhibited a bell-shaped dose-dependent cell migration stimulating activity (\nFIG. 24\n).\n\n\nINDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY\n\n\nFPRL1 ligand of the present invention, FPRL1 of the present invention, or DNA encoding FPRL1 of the present invention can be used as, for example, an anti-inflammatory agent.\n\n\nBy using FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 of the present invention, a compound that alters binding property between FPRL1 ligand and FPRL1 can efficiently be screened."

Description\n\n\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims priority to U.S. provisional application Nos. 61/069,763, filed Mar. 17, 2008 and 61/110,508 file Oct. 31, 2008. The disclosures of the above referenced applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.\n\n\n \nFIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nProvided herein are compounds that are modulators of RAF kinases, including BRAF kinase, compositions comprising the compounds and methods of use thereof. The compounds provided are useful in the treatment, prevention, or amelioration of a disease or disorder related to RAF, including BRAF kinase, activity or one or more symptoms thereof.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein kinases (PKs) are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups on tyrosine, serine or threonine residues of proteins. Protein kinases act primarily as growth factor receptors and play a central role in signal transduction pathways regulating a number of cellular functions, such as cell cycle, cell growth, cell differentiation and cell death.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne important signal transduction pathway is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The MAPK signaling pathway is responsible for the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, proliferation and survival and its dysregulation is implicated in a broad spectrum of cancer. (Hoshino, et al., \nOncogene, \n1999, 18, 813-822)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe MAPK signaling pathway is one of multiple signaling pathways activated by GTP-bound RAS. Initially, extracellular stimuli such as mitogens, hormones or neurotransmitters induce receptor tyrosine kinase dimerization leading to increased levels of GTP-bound RAS. Activated RAS recruits dimerized RAF kinase to the plasma membrane whereby RAF is activated by autophosphorylation or phosphorylation by other kinases. The activation of RAF initiates the phosphorylation cascade down the MEK/ERK pathway, in which activated RAF phosphorylates and activates MEK1/2 which in turn phosphorylates and activates ERK (or extracellular signal-regulated kinase, also called p44/42 MAPK) which in turn phosphorylates a number of targets including nuclear transcription factors that lead to changes in gene expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRAF is a family of serine/threonine kinases comprising three isoforms called ARAF, BRAF and CRAF (also called raf-1). BRAF is currently a cancer therapeutic target, as mutations in the BRAF gene are among the most common in cancer (Haluska, et al., Clin Cancer Res 2006, 12(7 Pt 2), 2301s-2307s; Ikediobi, et al., \nMol. Cancer. Ther. \n2006 5(11), 2606-2612; Greenman, et al., \nNature \n2007 226(7132), 153-158). The majority of mutant BRAF have been found to exhibit elevated kinase activity as measured by levels of phosphorylated MEK or ERK found endogenously in COS cells (Wan et al. \nCell \n2004 116, 855-867). BRAF mutations have been identified in about 7% of all known cancers, including 27-70% of melanoma (Davies et al. \nNature, \n2002 417, 949-954), 42-50% of papillary thyroid carcinoma, 36-53% colorectal cancers, and 5-22% serous ovarian cancers and to a lesser extent in breast cancer, endometrial cancer, liver cancer, sarcoma, stomach cancer, Barret's adenocarcinoma, gliomas including ependymomas and lung cancer including 1-2% of non small cell lung cancer (See Davies et al. \nNature, \n2002, 417, 949-954; Garnett and Marais, \nCancer Cell, \n2004 6, 313-319; Ouyang et al. \nClin Cancer Res \n2006 12(6), 1785-1793; Melillo, et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n2005, 115, 1068-1081; Wilhelm, et al., \nNat. Rev. Drug Discov., \n2006 5, 835-844; and Ji et al. \nCancer Res \n2007 67(10), 4933-4939). Over forty different missense mutations of BRAF have been identified, but among them, the V600E mutation, has been found to be the most predominant (Fecher, et al., \nJ. Clin. Oncology \n2007, 25(12), 1606-1620), accounting for nearly 90% of the mutations in melanoma and thyroid cancer and for a high proportion in colorectal cancer, which makes this mutation a particularly attractive target for molecular therapy. A study of the crystal structures of both wild type and V600 mutants suggests that substitution at the 600 position destabilizes the inactive conformation of the enzyme (Wan et al. op cit.). However, V600E mutation is comparatively rare in non-small cell lung cancer, which is more likely than not to be associated with non-V600E BRAF missense mutations (Brose et al. \nCancer Res., \n2002 62, 6997-7000). Other non-V600E BRAF missense mutations are also implicated in melanoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, ovarian cancer, leukemia including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Barret's adenocarcinoma, endometrial cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, thyroid cancer and endometrial cancer (Garnett and Marais, op. cit.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo efficacy has been demonstrated for BRAF inhibitors NVP-AAL881-NX (also AAL881) and NVP-L T613-AG-8 (LBT613) in mouse tumor xenograft models using human cell lines (See, Ouyang et al. op. cit.). Preclinical studies have also shown that BRAF inhibition by siRNA or by the small molecule RAF kinase inhibitor Sorafenib resulted in a decrease in tumor growth or metastases in animals (Sharma et al. \nCancer Res., \n2005, 65(6), 2412-2421; Sharma et al. \nCancer Res., \n2006, (66)16, 8200-8209). RAF inhibitors that have entered clinical trials include antisense oligonucleotides against CRAF such as ISIS 5132 and LErafAON and small molecule BRAF inhibitors such as BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib), Raf-265 (formerly CHIR-265, Novartis), PLX-4032 (Plexxikon) and XL281 (Exelixis).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough most BRAF mutations are activating mutations, mutants having impaired kinase activity have been identified, and shown to stimulate ERK activity, presumably through recruitment of CRAF (Wan op cit.). Therefore, CRAF represents another target for the treatment of diseases associated with this particular subset of BRAF mutants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOutside of cancer, the MAPK (Raf-Mek-Erk) signaling pathway could provide targets for inflammation and inflammatory diseases. The MAPK pathway is known to control cell survival and apoptosis of inflammatory cells such as basophils, macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes (See Dong et al., \nAnnu. Rev. Immunol., \n2002, 20, 55-72; Johnson, et al., \nCurr. Opin. Chem. Biol., \n2005, 9, 325-331; R. Herrera and J. S. Sebolt-Leopold, \nTrends Mol. Med., \n2002, 8, S27-S3; and Kyriakis et al., \nPhysiol. Rev., \n2002, 81, 807-869). In the carrageenan-induced pleurisy rat model, it has been shown that the Erk1/2 inhibitor PD98059 inhibits eosinophilic proinflammatory cytokine release by increasing the rate of neutrophil apoptosis thereby decreasing the number of macrophage and neutrophils that perpetuate the inflammatory response (Sawatzky et al., \nAm J Pathol \n2006, 168(1), 33-41). It is therefore possible that one downstream effect of inhibiting RAF might be the resolution of an inflammatory response and BRAF inhibitors could be useful for the treatment of inflammatory diseases or immune system disorders including inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes, sarcoidosis, psoriasis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) (See Stanton et al. \nDev. Biol. \n2003 263, 165-175, Hofman et al. \nCurr. Drug Targets. Inflamm. Allergy \n2004 2, 1-9).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGiven the multitude of diseases attributed to the dysregulation of MAPK signaling, there is an ever-existing need to provide novel classes of compounds that are useful as inhibitors of enzymes in the MAPK signaling pathway, as discussed herein.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nProvided herein are compounds of formula I.

Methods for purification of the compounds to produce substantially chemically pure compounds are known to those of skill in the art. A substantially chemically pure compound may, however, be a mixture of stereoisomers. In such instances, further purification might increase the specific activity of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless specifically stated otherwise, where a compound may assume alternative tautomeric, regioisomeric and/or stereoisomeric forms, all alternative isomers are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the claimed subject matter. For example, where a compound is described as having one of two tautomeric forms, it is intended that the both tautomers be encompassed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the compounds provided herein may be enantiomerically pure, or be stereoisomeric or diastereomeric mixtures. In the case of amino acid residues, such residues may be of either the L- or D-form. The configuration for naturally occurring amino acid residues is generally L. When not specified the residue is the L form. As used herein, the term “amino acid” refers to α-amino acids which are racemic, or of either the D- or L-configuration. The designation “d” preceding an amino acid designation (e.g., dAla, dSer, dVal, etc.) refers to the D-isomer of the amino acid. The designation “dl” preceding an amino acid designation (e.g., dlPip) refers to a mixture of the L- and D-isomers of the amino acid. It is to be understood that the chiral centers of the compounds provided herein may undergo epimerization in vivo. As such, one of skill in the art will recognize that administration of a compound in its (R) form is equivalent, for compounds that undergo epimerization in vivo, to administration of the compound in its (S) form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that the compounds provided herein may contain chiral centers. Such chiral centers may be of either the (R) or (S) configuration, or may be a mixture thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptically active (+) and (−), (R)- and (S)-, or (D)- and (L)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques, such as reverse phase HPLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “enantiomerically pure” or “pure enantiomer” denotes that the compound comprises more than 75% by weight, more than 80% by weight, more than 85% by weight, more than 90% by weight, more than 91% by weight, more than 92% by weight, more than 93% by weight, more than 94% by weight, more than 95% by weight, more than 96% by weight, more than 97% by weight, more than 98% by weight, more than 98.5% by weight, more than 99% by weight, more than 99.2% by weight, more than 99.5% by weight, more than 99.6% by weight, more than 99.7% by weight, more than 99.8% by weight or more than 99.9% by weight, of the desired enantiomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the number of any given substituent is not specified (e.g., haloalkyl), there may be one or more substituents present. For example, “haloalkyl” may include one or more of the same or different halogens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the description herein, if there is any discrepancy between a chemical name and chemical structure, the structure preferably controls. As used herein, “isotopic composition” refers to the amount of each isotope present for a given atom, and “natural isotopic composition” refers to the naturally occurring isotopic composition or abundance for a given atom. Atoms containing their natural isotopic composition may also be referred to herein as “non-enriched” atoms. Unless otherwise designated, the atoms of the compounds recited herein are meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom. For example, unless otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as “H” or “hydrogen”, the position is understood to have hydrogen at its natural isotopic composition.\n\n\n \n \nAs used herein, “isotopically enriched” refers to an atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. “Isotopically enriched” may also refer to a compound containing at least one atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom.\n\n\nAs used herein, “isotopic enrichment” refers to the percentage of incorporation of an amount of a specific isotope at a given atom in a molecule in the place of that atom's natural isotopic abundance. For example, deuterium enrichment of 1% at a given position means that 1% of the molecules in a given sample contain deuterium at the specified position. Because the naturally occurring distribution of deuterium is about 0.0156%, deuterium enrichment at any position in a compound synthesized using non-enriched starting materials is about 0.0156%. The isotopic enrichment of the compounds provided herein can be determined using conventional analytical methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art, including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Anti-cancer agents” refers to anti-metabolites (e.g., 5-fluoro-uracil, methotrexate, fludarabine), antimicrotubule agents (e.g., vinca alkaloids such as vincristine, vinblastine; taxanes such as paclitaxel, docetaxel), alkylating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide, melphalan, carmustine, nitrosoureas such as bischloroethylnitrosurea and hydroxyurea), platinum agents (e.g. cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, JM-216 or satraplatin, CI-973), anthracyclines (e.g., doxrubicin, daunorubicin), antitumor antibiotics (e.g., mitomycin, idarubicin, adriamycin, daunomycin), topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., etoposide, camptothecins), anti-angiogenesis agents (e.g. Sutent® and Bevacizumab) or any other cytotoxic agents, (estramustine phosphate, prednimustine), hormones or hormone agonists, antagonists, partial agonists or partial antagonists, kinase inhibitors, and radiation treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Anti-inflammatory agents” refers to matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, inhibitors of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., anti-TNF molecules, TNF soluble receptors, and IL1) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as prostaglandin synthase inhibitors (e.g., choline magnesium salicylate, salicylsalicyclic acid), COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors), or glucocorticoid receptor agonists such as corticosteroids, methylprednisone, prednisone, or cortisone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the abbreviations for any protective groups, amino acids and other compounds, are, unlessindicated otherwise, in accord with their common usage, recognized abbreviations, or the IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (see, \nBiochem. \n1972, 11:942-944).\n\n\n \nB.

Isotopic enrichment (for example, deuteration) of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics (“PK”), pharmacodynamics (“PD”), and toxicity profiles, has been demonstrated previously with some classes of drugs. See, for example, Lijinsky et. al., \nFood Cosmet. Toxicol., \n20: 393 (1982); Lijinsky et. al., \nJ. Nat. Cancer Inst., \n69: 1127 (1982); Mangold et. al., \nMutation Res. \n308: 33 (1994); Gordon et. al., \nDrug Metab. Dispos., \n15: 589 (1987); Zello et. al., \nMetabolism, \n43: 487 (1994); Gately et. al., \nJ. Nucl. Med., \n27: 388 (1986); Wade D, \nChem. Biol. Interact. \n117: 191 (1999).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsotopic enrichment of a drug can be used, for example, to (1) reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites, (2) increase the half-life of the parent drug, (3) decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect, (4) decrease the amount of a dose necessary to achieve a desired effect, (5) increase the formation of active metabolites, if any are formed, and/or (6) decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues and/or create a more effective drug and/or a safer drug for combination therapy, whether the combination therapy is intentional or not.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReplacement of an atom for one of its isotopes often will result in a change in the reaction rate of a chemical reaction. This phenomenon is known as the Kinetic Isotope Effect (“KIE”). For example, if a C—H bond is broken during a rate-determining step in a chemical reaction (i.e. the step with the highest transition state energy), substitution of a deuterium for that hydrogen will cause a decrease in the reaction rate and the process will slow down. This phenomenon is known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (“DKIE”). (See, e.g, Foster et al., Adv. Drug Res., vol. 14, pp. 1-36 (1985); Kushner et al., Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., vol. 77, pp. 79-88 (1999)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTritium (“T”) is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, used in research, fusion reactors, neutron generators and radiopharmaceuticals. Tritium is a hydrogen atom that has 2 neutrons in the nucleus and has an atomic weight close to 3. It occurs naturally in the environment in very low concentrations, most commonly found as T\n2\nO. Tritium decays slowly (half-life=12.3 years) and emits a low energy beta particle that cannot penetrate the outer layer of human skin. Internal exposure is the main hazard associated with this isotope, yet it must be ingested in large amounts to pose a significant health risk. As compared with deuterium, a lesser amount of tritium must be consumed before it reaches a hazardous level. Substitution of tritium (“T”) for hydrogen results in yet a stronger bond than deuterium and gives numerically larger isotope effects. Similarly, substitution of isotopes for other elements, including, but not limited to, \n13\nC or \n14\nC for carbon, \n33\nS, \n34\nS, or \n36\nS for sulfur, \n15\nN for nitrogen, and \n17\nO or \n18\nO for oxygen, will provide a similar kinetic isotope effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, provided herein are methods of using the disclosed compounds and compositions, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, or hydrates thereof, for the local or systemic treatment or prophylaxis of human and veterinary diseases, disorders and conditions modulated or otherwise affected mediated via RAF kinase, including BRAF kinase, activity.\n\n\n \nC.

Osmotic Controlled Release Devices\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using an osmotic controlled release device, including one-chamber system, two-chamber system, asymmetric membrane technology (AMT), and extruding core system (ECS). In general, such devices have at least two components: (a) the core which contains the active ingredient(s); and (b) a semipermeable membrane with at least one delivery port, which encapsulates the core. The semipermeable membrane controls the influx of water to the core from an aqueous environment of use so as to cause drug release by extrusion through the delivery port(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the active ingredient(s), the core of the osmotic device optionally includes an osmotic agent, which creates a driving force for transport of water from the environment of use into the core of the device. One class of osmotic agents water-swellable hydrophilic polymers, which are also referred to as “osmopolymers” and “hydrogels,” including, but not limited to, hydrophilic vinyl and acrylic polymers, polysaccharides such as calcium alginate, polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic) acid, poly(methacrylic) acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), crosslinked PVP, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA/PVP copolymers, PVA/PVP copolymers with hydrophobic monomers such as methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, hydrophilic polyurethanes containing large PEO blocks, sodium croscarmellose, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carboxyethyl, cellulose (CEC), sodium alginate, polycarbophil, gelatin, xanthan gum, and sodium starch glycolate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe other class of osmotic agents is osmogens, which are capable of imbibing water to affect an osmotic pressure gradient across the barrier of the surrounding coating. Suitable osmogens include, but are not limited to, inorganic salts, such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium phosphates, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, lithium sulfate, potassium chloride, and sodium sulfate; sugars, such as dextrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, lactose, maltose, mannitol, raffinose, sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and xylitol; organic acids, such as ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, sebacic acid, sorbic acid, adipic acid, edetic acid, glutamic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid; urea; and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOsmotic agents of different dissolution rates can be employed to influence how rapidly the active ingredient(s) is initially delivered from the dosage form. For example, amorphous sugars, such as MANNOGEM™ EZ (SPI Pharma, Lewes, Del.) can be used to provide faster delivery during the first couple of hours to promptly produce the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of the remaining amount to maintain the desired level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In this case, the active ingredient(s) is released at such a rate to replace the amount of the active ingredient metabolized and excreted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe core can also include a wide variety of other excipients and carriers as described herein to enhance the performance of the dosage form or to promote stability or processing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaterials useful in forming the semipermeable membrane include various grades of acrylics, vinyls, ethers, polyamides, polyesters, and cellulosic derivatives that are water-permeable and water-insoluble at physiologically relevant pHs, or are susceptible to being rendered water-insoluble by chemical alteration, such as crosslinking.

No. 5,798,119. Such hydrophobic but water-vapor permeable membrane are typically composed of hydrophobic polymers such as polyalkenes, polyethylene, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyacrylic acid derivatives, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe delivery port(s) on the semipermeable membrane can be formed post-coating by mechanical or laser drilling. Delivery port(s) can also be formed in situ by erosion of a plug of water-soluble material or by rupture of a thinner portion of the membrane over an indentation in the core. In addition, delivery ports can be formed during coating process, as in the case of asymmetric membrane coatings of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,612,059 and 5,698,220.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe total amount of the active ingredient(s) released and the release rate can substantially by modulated via the thickness and porosity of the semipermeable membrane, the composition of the core, and the number, size, and position of the delivery ports.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions in an osmotic controlled-release dosage form can further comprise additional conventional excipients or carriers as described herein to promote performance or processing of the formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe osmotic controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art (see, \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy\n, supra; Santus and Baker, \nJ.

Chem. \n43:2923).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is understood that in the following description, combinations of substituents and/or variables of the depicted formulae are permissible only if such contributions result in stable compounds under standard conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the process described below the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by suitable protecting groups. Such functional groups include hydroxy, amino, mercapto and carboxylic acid. Suitable protecting groups for hydroxy include trialkylsilyl or diarylalkylsilyl (e.g., t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl or trimethylsilyl), tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for amino, amidino and guanidino include t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and the like. Suitable protecting groups for mercapto include —C(O)—R (where R is alkyl, aryl or aralkyl), p-methoxybenzyl, trityl and the like. Suitable protecting groups for carboxylic acid include alkyl, aryl or aralkyl esters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtecting groups may be added or removed in accordance with standard techniques, which are well-known to those skilled in the art and as described herein. The use of protecting groups is described in detail in Green, T. W. and P. G. M. Wutz, \nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis \n(1991), 2nd Ed., Wiley-Interscience.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of ordinary skill in the art could easily ascertain which choices for each substituent are possible for the reaction conditions of each Scheme. Moreover, the substituents are selected from components as indicated in the specification heretofore, and may be attached to starting materials, intermediates, and/or final products according to schemes known to those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso it will be apparent that the compounds provided herein could exist as one or more isomers, that is E/Z isomers, enantiomers and/or diastereomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (I) may be generally prepared as depicted in the following schemes, unless otherwise noted, the various substituents are as defined elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStandard abbreviations and acronyms as defined in \nJ.

Activated quinazoline may be synthesized starting from anthranilic esters (1c, where R is alkyl) which are either commercially available, or are prepared from benzoic ester derivatives (1a, where R is alkyl), which undergoes classical nitration to yield the 2-nitro benzoic ester derivative (1b) which is followed by separation from any undesired regioisomers by crystallization or chromatography. For the reduction step, the 2-nitro intermediate in a suitable solvent such as water, C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalcohol, ethyl acetate or N,N-dimethylformamide, may be reacted with reducing agents such as hydrogen gas in the presence of noble metal catalyst, sodium dithionite, tin chloride, tin or iron metal in the presence of acid, and the like, to yield the anthranilic ester intermediate (1c).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are many synthetic routes known to one skilled in the art that may be used to prepare the 4-hydroxy quinazoline derivative (1d). One route that may be used is the condensation of a suitable anthranilic ester derivative with formamide or a suitable formamide derivative such as formamidine hydrochloride in a suitable solvent such as ethanol at a temperature from 100° C. to 130° C., normally in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid (See, for example, Ballard et al. \nBioorganic \n& \nMedicinal Chemistry Letters \n2006, 16, 1633-1637) to yield 1d. Following isolation, the intermediate 4-hydroxyquinazoline derivative may be treated with an activating agent such as a phosphoric oxytrihalide or an aryl- or alkylsulfonyl halide to produce the activated quinazoline intermediate (1e) (See, for example, Takase et al. \nJ. Med. Chem. \n1994, 37, 2106-2111).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhenyleneamine derivatives (2b) may be prepared according to Scheme 2 by reaction of corresponding activated quinazoline derivatives (1e) with the unprotected meta-hydroxy-(X═O) or meta-mercapto (X═S) aniline (2a) in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or N,N-dimethylformamide at a temperature from 40° C. to 85° C., with formation (preferably preformation) of the oxa or sulfa anion with a base such as sodium hydride or cesium carbonate.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, as will be apparent to one skilled in the art, the free amino group of 2a in Scheme 2 may be introduced in the form of an appropriate precursor, for example nitro or protected amino, followed by liberation of the free amine by nitro reduction or amine deprotection, respectively, to furnish 2b.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiaryl ureas having the Formula I may be prepared according to Scheme 3 by the reaction of a phenyleneamine derivative (2b) (which may be prepared as described in Scheme 2), with an activated arylcarbamic acid derivative (3b, where Ar can be aryl or heteroaryl, which may be prepared as described below), where Z is a leaving group such as halo or optionally substituted phenoxy, for example.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, diaryl ureas having the Formula I may be prepared according to Scheme 4 when R\n5\n═H. Phenyleneamine (2b) is treated with an aryl isocyanate (4b, where Ar can be aryl or heteroaryl) in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a temperature from 25° C. to 60° C., optionally in the presence of a base.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, compounds having the Formula I may be prepared according to scheme 5 by the reaction of a hydroxy-(X═O) or mercapto-(X═S) substituted diaryl urea (5a, where Ar can be aryl or heteroaryl, which may be prepared as described below), with an activated quinazoline derivative (1e, where Y is a leaving group such as halo, aryl- or alkylsulfonate, which may be prepared as described in Scheme 1), in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a temperature from 40° C. to 80° C., normally in the presence of a base such as sodium hydride or cesium carbonate.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, R\n1 \nsubstituents of diaryl ureas having the Formula I, prepared as shown in Schemes 3, 4 and 5, may be further modified. For example, R\n1 \ncontaining a haloalkyl moiety may be transformed to, for example, an aminoalkyl, alkoxyalkyl or thioalkyl, by treatment with, respectively, amines, alkoxides or thiolates. Alternatively, R\n1 \ncontaining a carboxylic acid or carboxylic ester group may be transformed to the corresponding amides, amidines, alcohol, aldeyhdes, ketones, and aldehyde or ketone derivatives including oximes, hydrazones and the like. Where R\n1 \ncontains a hydroxy group, the hydroxy group may be derivatized to form the corresponding ester (by acylation), corresponding carbamate (by carbamylation), corresponding imidate and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nArylcarbamoyl derivatives may be prepared as in Scheme 6 by treatment of corresponding aryl amines (6a, R\n5\n═H) with a reagent such as an aryl chloroformate in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dichloromethane in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate at a temperature from 25° C. to 60° C. to give the corresponding aryl carbamate (6b or 3b, where Z may be, for example, phenoxy). When R\n5\n≠H, phosgene, trichloromethyl chloroformate, or bis-trichloromethyl carbonate may be used to prepare arylcarbamoyl chloride variants (6c where Hal is halogen, or 3b, where Z may be, for example, halo).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 7 shows the preparation of isocyanate derivatives (4b) which are prepared by treatment of corresponding primary aryl amines (7a) (where Ar may be aryl or heteroaryl) with phosgene, trichloromethyl chloroformate, or bis-trichloromethyl carbonate in a solvent such as toluene in the presence of a base such as triethylamine at a temperature from 25° C. to 110° C. to give the corresponding isocyanate (4b) (where Ar may be aryl or heteroaryl).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAryl amine derivatives (7a), wherein Ar is a 5-membered heteroaromatic ring, may be prepared by condensation of appropriate fragments and precursors by methods well known in the art and described in texts such as Gilchrist, T. L., \nHeterocyclic Chemistry \n(1992), 2nd Ed., Longman Scientific & Technical and John Wiley & Sons. Scheme 8 shows one example where Ar is 5-substituted-3-aminoisoxazole, whereby an appropriate 3-oxonitrile (8a) is treated with hydroxylamine under appropriate conditions of pH and temperature which is described, for example, in Takase et al. \nHeterocycles \n1991 32(6), 1153-1158, to afford the desired aryl amine product (8b). This method is particularly applicable for cases in which the atom of R\n10 \ndirectly attached to the aromatic ring is highly substituted, for example, is an α,α-dialkyl substituent (See Takase et al. \nHeterocycles \n1991 32(6), 1153-1158).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 9 shows an example for the case where Ar is 3-substituted-5-aminoisoxazole, whereby an appropriate 3-oxonitrile 9a is treated with hydroxylamine under appropriate conditions of pH and temperature, as described again in Takase et al. \nHeterocycles \n1991 32(6), 1153-1158, to afford the desired aryl amine product (9b). This method is particularly applicable for cases in which the atom of R\n10 \ndirectly attached to the aromatic ring is not highly substituted, for example, is not an α,α-dialkyl substituent (See Eddington et al. \nEur. J. Med. Chem. \n2002 37, 635-648), or when R\n10 \ncontains one or more highly electron-withdrawing groups, eg, fluorine, or under special conditions of pH and solvent, such as ethanol and water mixture as described in EP 0220947.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 10 shows an example for the case where Ar is a 2,5-disubstituted-3-aminopyrazole, whereby an appropriate 3-oxonitrile (10a) is treated with a monosubstituted hydrazine under appropriate conditions of pH and temperature to afford the desired aryl amine product (10b).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on R\n10\n, in order to influence the yield and regiochemical outcome of the condensation reaction, 3-oxonitrile (10a) may be productively replaced in the foregoing schemes by oxo-protected derivatives of (10a), such as an enol ether derivative (10c, R=lower alkyl or substituted silyl) or a ketal derivative (10d, R=lower alkyl or taken together, an alkylene derivative to form a ketal ring). These derivatives are prepared from 3-oxonitrile under standard conditions, for example as described in Chan et al. \nSynthesis \n1983 203-205.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 11 illustrates preparation of the requisite 3-oxonitriles (10a) by reaction of an R\n10\n-containing carboxylic ester (11a) with an akali metal salt of acetonitrile (11b) (See, for example, U.S. Pat.

Kinases were produced as fusions to T7 phage (See, Fabian et al. or WO04/015142) or alternatively, the kinases were expressed in HEK-293 cells and subsequently tagged with DNA for PCR detection (See, WO08/005,310). For the binding assays, streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were treated with biotinylated affinity ligands for 30 min at room temperature to generate affinity resins. The liganded beads were blocked with excess biotin and washed with blocking buffer (SeaBlock (Pierce), 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM DTT) to remove unbound ligand and to reduce non-specific binding. Binding reactions were assembled by combining kinase, liganded affinity beads, and test compounds in 1× binding buffer (20% SeaBlock, 0.17×PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 6 mM DTT). Test compounds were prepared as 100× stocks in DMSO and rapidly diluted into the aqueous environment. DMSO was added to control assays lacking a test compound. Primary screen interactions were performed in polypropylene 384-well plates in a final volume of 34 μt, while K\nd \ndeterminations were performed in polystyrene 96-well plates in a final volume of 135 pt. The assay plates were incubated at room temperature with shaking for 1 hour, long enough for binding reactions to reach equilibrium, and the affinity beads were washed extensively with wash buffer (1×PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) to remove unbound protein. The beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (1×PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 2 μM non-biotinylated affinity ligand) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for 30 min. The kinase concentration in the eluates was measured by quantitative PCR. Each kinase was tested individually against each compound. K\nds \nwere determined using eleven serial threefold dilutions. A selectivity score, which is a quantitative measure of selectivity of a compound against a panel of enzymes, may be calculated for a compound by dividing the number of enzymes for which a compound meets a set criteria, (for example, a binding constant of 100 nM or less), by the total number of enzymes tested. Table 1 provides a kinase selectivity score, S35, which was calculated for each compound by dividing the number of kinases for which a compound displayed inhibition of 65% or greater compared to negative control lacking inhibitors (DMSO only), divided by the 290 distinct kinases tested excluding mutant variants. (Note, for those compounds tested in a larger kinase panel, as indicated by an asterisk (*) next to the S35 score, the divisor is 321 (i.e. the larger panel contains 321 distinct kinases, excluding mutant variants.)).\n\n\n \nExample 401\n\n\nMEK Phosphorylation ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nA MEK1 phosphorylation ELISA (Biosource, MEK1 [pSpS218/222] kit, Catalog #KHO00321) was used to measure the inhibition of MEK1 phosphorylation in the A375 human melanoma cell line in the presence of the compounds provided herein. The A375 cell line contains wild-type N-Ras but has a constitutively active BRAF carrying the V600E mutation. A total MEK ELISA was also run in parallel in order to measure the amount of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated MEK 1(Biosource, tMEK kit, Catalog #KHO0291).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA375 cells (from American Type Culture Collection) were plated at 50,000 cells per well in DMEM (Mediatech) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific) into a 96 well plate and incubated overnight in a 37° C. incubator with 10% CO2. The cells were then washed with PBS and the medium replaced with 0.5% FBS for incubation overnight. A solution of the test compound in DMSO was added to each well at varying concentrations, or alternatively, a solution of positive control (an internal compound previously determined to have an IC50 of less than 20 nM in this phospho-MEK assay), or negative control (DMSO) was added to the wells at varying concentrations. The cells were incubated with compound or control for two hours at 37° C. The compound solution was aspirated off and the cells washed with cold PBS. The cells were then lysed for 30 minutes in the cold with Cell Extraction Buffer containing Phosphatase Inhibitors (catalog #FNN0011, Invitrogen) and protease inhibitors (catalog #11873580001, Roche Applied Science). The plate was centrifuged for 30 minutes to pellet out the cell debris. The cleared lysates were transferred to a 96-well Nunc plate and the ELISA protocol described by the manufacturer in Catalog #KHO0321 or KHO0291 was followed. The reaction was read at 450 nM using an ELISA plate reader. The percent inhibition of MEK1 phosphorylation was determined for each compound at each concentration, and the concentration of the test compound necessary for inhibiting 50% of MEK1 phosphorylation (IC\n50\n) was calculated. The results are summarized in Table 1.\n\n\n \nExample 402\n\n\nA375 Proliferation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nA375 cells (derived from a human melanoma cell line containing wild-type N—Ras but which also has a constitutively active BRAF carrying the V600E mutation obtained from ATCC), were plated at 10,000 cells per well into a 96 well TC-treated plate in M3 medium (Mediatech Cell grow) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega-Scientific) and incubated overnight in a 37° C. incubator under 10% CO2. The following day, the medium was replaced with 0.5% FBS in M3 for overnight incubation. At day three, a solution of the test compound in DMSO was added to each well at varying concentrations, or alternatively, a solution of positive control (an internal compound previously determined to have an IC\n50 \nof less than 20 nM in the phospho-MEK assay) in DMSO, or negative control (DMSO) was added to the wells at varying concentrations. The cells were incubated with compound or control for 72 hours at 37° C. under 10% CO2. Following incubation, Cell Titer Blue reagent (Promega) was added to each well containing compounds or controls, and then incubated for 3 hours at 37° C. under 10% CO2. Proliferation was measured by fluorescence with excitation at 560 nm and emission at 590 nm using SoftMax Pro. The percent inhibition of proliferation was determined for each compound at each concentration, and the concentration of the test compound necessary for inhibiting cell proliferation by 50% (IC\n50\n) was calculated. The results are summarized in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince modifications will be apparent to those of skill in the art, it is intended that the claimed subject matter be limited only by the scope of the appended claims."

Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention concerns compounds having inhibitory activity on sigma receptors. It concerns further to compositions comprising these compounds as active ingredients, as well as processes for preparing these compounds and compositions.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nPsychiatric and neurologic disorders are among the most severe and chronic diseases and conditions. These disorders are also extremely difficult to treat effectively because of the multiplicity of the symptoms and etiologies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmongst the therapeutic arsenal to combat these psychiatric and neurologic disorders, sigma receptor—inhibitors have been found useful in the treatment of psychosis and movement disorders such as dystonia and tardive dyskinesia, and motor disturbances associated with Huntington's chorea or Tourette's syndrome and in Parkinson's disease (Walker, J. M. et al, \nPharmacological Reviews, \n1990, 42, 355).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO2006021462 and WO2007098953 describe pyrazole-containing compounds having pharmacological activity towards the sigma receptor, useful in the therapy of pain, in general, and, more particularly, in treatment of neuropathic pain or allodynia. These compounds have the following chemical structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO200027394 discloses activators of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) having a pyrazole ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn spite of this background, there is still a need in the art to provide alternative pyrazole-containing compounds having pharmacological activity towards the sigma receptor, useful in the therapy of pain, in general, and more particularly, in the treatment of neuropathic pain or allodynia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, it would be highly desirable to provide new sigma receptor inhibitors which are superior to others known in the art in one or more of the following pharmacological related properties: potency, increased affinity for sigma receptors, enhanced analgesic effect, decreased cytotoxicity, improved pharmacokinetics, acceptable dosage, and pill burden, for example.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compounds having the formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein the dashed line (represented by - - - - -) represents an optional double bond;\n\n\nR\n1 \nis hydrogen and R\n2 \nis hydroxyethyl;

or R\n1 \nand R\n2 \ntogether with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a morpholinyl ring optionally substituted with one or two hydroxy groups;\n\n\neach R\n3 \nis independently hydroxy or C\n1-6\nalkoxy;\n\n\nn is selected from 0, 1, and 2;\n\n\nor an N-oxide, salt, prodrug, solvate or stereoisomer thereof;\n\n\nwith the proviso that the compound where the dashed line represents a double bond, R\n1 \nand R\n2 \ntogether with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a morpholinyl ring, and n is 0, is excluded.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following definitions apply to the terms used herein unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein C\n1-4\nalkyl, as a group or part of a group, defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, 1-methylethyl, butyl; C\n1-6\nalkyl, as a group or part of a group, defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as the group defined for C\n1-4\nalkyl and pentyl, hexyl, and 2-methylbutyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term C\n1-6\nalkoxy means C\n1-6\nalkyloxy or a C\n1-6\nalkyl ether radical, wherein the term C\n1-6\nalkyl is as defined above. Examples of suitable alkyl ether radicals include methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, iso-butoxy, sec-butoxy, tert-butoxy, and hexanoxy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the compounds of formula (I) or subgroups thereof, the substituent —R\n3 \nmay be bonded to any carbon atom of the naphthyl or the 5,6-dihydronaphthalenyl ring, for example, the substituent —R\n3 \nmay be bonded to any one of carbon atoms 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, as depicted hereafter:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be noted that the radical positions on any molecular moiety used in the definitions may be anywhere on such moiety as long as it is chemically stable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadicals used in the definitions of any variable herein include all possible isomers unless otherwise indicated. For instance, pentyl includes 1-pentyl, 2-pentyl and 3-pentyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent, each definition is independent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhenever used herein, the term “compounds of formula (I)”, or “the present compounds” or similar terms, is meant to include the compounds of formula (I), their N-oxides, salts, prodrugs, quaternary amines, metal complexes, solvates and stereochemically isomeric forms. One embodiment of this invention comprises compounds of formula (I) or any subgroup of compounds of formula (I) specified herein, as well as their N-oxides and salts in their possible stereoisomeric forms. Another embodiment of this invention comprises compounds of formula (I) or any subgroup of compounds of formula (I) specified herein, as well as their salts in their possible stereoisomeric forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) may have several centers of chirality and may exist as stereochemically isomeric forms. The term “stereoisomers” or “stereochemically isomeric forms”, as used herein, define all possible variants of the compounds of formula (I) made up of the same atoms bonded by the same sequence of bonds, but having different three-dimensional structures, and which are not interchangeable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, those compounds of formula (I) wherein\n\n \n \n \n \n \nthe dashed line (represented by - - - - -) is not present, i.e. there is no double bond resulting in a 5,6-dihydronaphthalenyl ring in compound of formula (I), and R\n3 \nis bonded to carbon atoms 5, 6, or 5 and 6; or\n \nR\n1 \nand R\n2 \ntogether with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached form a morpholinyl ring substituted with one or two hydroxy groups;\n\n\ndo have at least one center of chirality.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nWith reference to the instances where (R) or (S) is used to designate the absolute configuration of a chiral atom within a substituent, the designation is done taking into consideration the whole compound and not the substituent in isolation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound encompasses the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, which said compound may possess. Said mixture may contain all diastereomers and/or enantiomers of the basic molecular structure of said compound. All stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of the present invention, both in pure or mixed form, are intended to be comprised within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates, as mentioned herein, are defined as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the same basic molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates. In particular, the term “stereoisomerically pure” concerns compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of at least 80% (i.e. minimum 90% of one isomer and maximum 10% of the other possible isomers) up to a stereoisomeric excess of 100% (i.e. 100% of one isomer and none of the other), more in particular, compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of 90% up to 100%, even more in particular, having a stereoisomeric excess of 94% up to 100% and, most in particular, having a stereoisomeric excess of 97% up to 100%. The terms “enantiomerically pure” and “diastereomerically pure” should be understood in a similar way, but taking into account to the enantiomeric excess, and the diastereomeric excess, respectively, of the mixture in question.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates of this invention may be obtained by the application of procedures known in the art. For instance, enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids or bases. Examples thereof are tartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, ditoluoyltartaric acid and camphosulfonic acid. Alternatively, enantiomers may be separated by chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. If a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized preferably by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) may be obtained as racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I) may be converted into their corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms could be separated subsequently, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization, and the product enantiomers liberated by alkali or acid. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography, in particular, liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. If a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound may be synthesized preferably by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods may advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diastereomeric racemates of the compounds of formula (I) can be obtained separately by conventional methods. Appropriate physical separation methods that may advantageously be employed are, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some of the compounds of formula (I), their N-oxides, salts, solvates, prodrugs, quaternary amines, or metal complexes, and the intermediates used in the preparation thereof, the absolute stereochemical configuration was not experimentally determined. A person skilled in the art is able to determine the absolute configuration of such compounds using known methods such as, for example, X-ray diffraction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the compounds of formula (I) and intermediates thereof may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such forms, although not explicitly indicated in the above formula, are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is also intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring on the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Isotopes of carbon include C-13 and C-14.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce adverse, allergic, or other untoward reactions when administered to an animal or a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “prodrug”, as used throughout this text, means pharmacologically acceptable derivatives of a compound, such as esters, amides and phosphates, such that the resulting in vivo biotransformation product of the derivative is the active drug as defined in the compounds of formula (I). The reference by Goodman and Gilman (The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 8th ed, McGraw-Hill, Int. Ed. 1992, “Biotransformation of Drugs”, p 13-15) describing prodrugs generally is hereby incorporated. Preferably, prodrugs should have excellent aqueous solubility, increased bioavailability and be readily metabolized into active inhibitors in vivo. Prodrugs of a compound according to the present invention may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either by routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable ester prodrugs, which are hydrolysable in vivo and derived from those compounds of formula (I) having a hydroxy or a carboxyl group, are preferred according to the present invention. An in vivo hydrolysable ester is an ester, which is hydrolysed in the human or animal body, to produce the parent acid or alcohol. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable esters for carboxy include C\n1-6\nalkoxymethyl esters for example methoxy-methyl, C\n1-6\nalkanoyloxymethyl esters for example pivaloyloxymethyl, phthalidyl esters, C\n3-8\ncycloalkoxycarbonyloxyC\n1-6 \nalkyl esters for example 1-cyclohexylcarbonyl-oxyethyl; 1,3-dioxolen-2-onylmethyl esters for example 5-methyl-1,3-dioxolen-2-onylmethyl; and C\n1-6\nalkoxycarbonyloxyethyl esters for example 1-methoxycarbonyl-oxyethyl which may be formed at any carboxy group in the compounds of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn in vivo hydrolysable ester of a compound of the formula (I), containing a hydroxy group, includes inorganic esters such as phosphate esters and α-acyloxyalkyl ethers and related compounds, that as a result of the in vivo hydrolysis of the ester breakdown to give the parent hydroxy group. Examples of α-acyloxyalkyl ethers include acetoxy-methoxy and 2,2-dimethylpropionyloxy-methoxy. A selection of in vivo hydrolysable ester forming groups for hydroxy include alkanoyl, benzoyl, phenylacetyl and substituted benzoyl and phenylacetyl, alkoxycarbonyl (to give alkyl carbonate esters), dialkylcarbamoyl and N-(dialkylaminoethyl)-N-alkylcarbamoyl (to give carbamates), dialkylaminoacetyl and carboxyacetyl. Examples of substituents on benzoyl include morpholino and piperazino linked from a ring nitrogen atom via a methylene group to the 3- or 4-position of the benzoyl ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “salt” as mentioned herein is meant to comprise any stable salts, which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form, and preferably, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable are also encompassed within the scope of the present invention, since they refer to intermediates that are useful in the preparation of compounds with pharmacological activity. The salts can be conveniently obtained by treating the base form with the appropriate acids such as inorganic acids, like for example, hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic; sulfuric acid; nitric acid; phosphoric acid; or organic acids, like for instance, acetic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, 2-hydroxypropanoic, 2-oxopropanoic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, 2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propane-tricarboxylic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, 4-methylbenzene-sulfonic, cyclohexanesulfamic, 2-hydroxybenzoic, and 4-amino-2-hydroxybenzoic. Conversely, the salt form can be converted by treatment with alkali into the free base form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) containing an acidic proton may also be converted into their non-toxic metal or amine addition salt forms by treatment with the appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, and lysine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term salts is also meant to include the hydrates or solvates which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form, including, e.g. the alcoholates, such as methanolates or ethanolates. The term “solvate” refers to crystal forms of the compounds of formula (I) that contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of solvent. Since water is a solvent, solvates also include hydrates. The term “pseudopolymorph” is synonym to solvate since it applies to polymorphic crystalline forms that have solvent molecules incorporated in their lattice structures. Examples of solvates are hydrates and alcoholates, such as methanolates or ethanolates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “quaternary amine” as used herein defines the quaternary ammonium salts which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted alkylhalide, arylhalide or arylalkylhalide, e.g. methyliodide or benzyliodide. Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be used, such as alkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates, alkyl methanesulfonates, and alkyl p-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable counterions include chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoroacetate and acetate. The counterion of choice can be introduced using ion exchange resins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that the compounds of formula (I) may have metal binding, chelating, complex forming properties and therefore may exist as metal complexes or metal chelates. Such metalated derivatives of the compounds of formula (I) are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe N-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called N-oxide.

Preferably, they may be selected from a halide, e.g. bromide or chloride, or an arylsulfonyl group, e.g. mesylate, triflate, or tosylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the reaction of (II) with (III) is a nucleophilic substitution where LG1 is a better leaving group than LG2 in the sense that when attacked by the oxygen atom, it shall leave first when compared to LG2. The power of leaving groups in leaving a particular molecule is known to those skilled in the art, e.g. bromide is a better leaving group than chloride. This reaction is conducted in a reaction-inert suitable solvent, such as hydrocarbons like toluene; halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, chloroform; dipolar aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPT); ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), and mixtures thereof with water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment of the invention, the reaction between compound of formula (II) with a compound of formula (III) is carried out in the presence of a catalyst, preferably, a phase transfer catalyst, such as a quaternary ammonium salt like tetrabutylammonium chloride, triethylbenzyl-ammonium chloride, tri-n-octylmethylammonium chloride, trimethyldecylammonium chloride, tetramethylammonium bromide, and tetraethylammonium bromide, or a phosphonium salt, using an aqueous solution of alkali, such as an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate, or an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting compound of formula (IV) is further reacted with compound of formula (V) in a reaction-inert suitable solvent as indicated above. The nucleophilic attack results in compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (III), such as 1-bromo-2-chloroethane, are easily available from commercial suppliers, like Sigma-Aldrich.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the following list, there are provided different compounds of formula (V), which are easily prepared with either commercial products or literature references:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nmorpholine, from Sigma-Aldrich.\n \n2-aminoethanol, from Sigma-Aldrich.\n \n2-hydroxymorpholine, from \nJournal of Heterocyclic Chemistry, \n1981, 18(4), 825-8.\n \n3-hydroxymorpholine, from Kim, H.

Toxicol. \n2003, 16(6), 715-720.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the invention, a compound of formula (I) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (II) with (VI) in the presence of a base which is strong enough to detract a hydrogen from the hydroxy group of the pyrazoline ring, like for example, an alkali of alkaline metal hydride, such as lithium hydride or sodium hydride, or an alkali metal alkoxide, such as sodium or potassium methoxide or ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, or potassium carbonate, triethylamine, pyridine, sodium iodide or cesium carbonate, in the presence of a reaction-inert suitable solvent, such as a dipolar aprotic solvent, e.g. DMF, DMA, DMSO or N-methylpyrrolidone. The resulting alcoholate is reacted with (VI), wherein LG3 is a suitable leaving group as mentioned above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntermediates of formula (II) may be obtained as described in WO2006021462 and WO2007098953, which are incorporated herein by reference, by reacting a acetohydrazide derivative with an ethyl acetoacetate; by reacting an hydrazine derivative with an ethyl butynoate; or by the method provided by F. Effenberger and W. Hartmann, \nChem. Ber., \n102(10), 3260-3267, 1969, where an ethoxy-acrylic acid hydrazide is reacted with concentrated mineral acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the method provided in WO2006021462 and WO2007098953, an optionally substituted naphthalen-2-ylhydrazine, or an optionally substituted (5,6-dihydronaphthalen-2-yl)hydrazine, drawn both in the scheme below as a compound of formula (IX), or a salt thereof, is reacted with acetic anhydride in the presence of a suitable solvent, such as toluene. Subsequently, the resulting acetohydrazide derivative (X) is reacted with ethyl acetoacetate in the presence of phosphorus trichloride to cyclise and obtain a compound of formula (II). The optionally substituted naphthalen-2-ylhydrazine, the optionally substituted (5,6-dihydronaphthalen-2-yl)hydrazine, or a salt thereof, i.e. those compounds represented by formula (IX), may be obtained from an optionally substituted 2-nitronaphthalene or an optionally substituted 7-nitro-1,2-dihydronaphthalene, represented both by formula (VII), which is reduced to the corresponding amino derivative (VIII) by methods generally known by a person skilled in the art. The resulting amino moiety in compound of formula (VIII) is further oxidized with e.g. sodium nitrite in the presence of hydrogen chloride to form the diazonium salt, which is subsequently reduced with the aid of a reducing agent such as SnCl\n2\n, or sodium sulfite in the presence of sodium hydroxide, thereby obtaining the optionally substituted naphthalen-2-ylhydrazine, or the optionally substituted (5,6-dihydronaphthalen-2-yl)hydrazine of formula (IX).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be noted that a compound of formula (II) could present a tautomeric form, i.e. compound of formula (IIa) as depicted below. Both compounds of formula (II) and (IIa) are comprised within the scope of the present invention, in particular as intermediates of a compound of formula (I), and in the methods provided in the present invention for the preparation of a compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above-mentioned respective reactions, each of the obtained compounds, when necessary, can be collected from the reaction mixture according to the methods known in the art. For example, when insoluble materials are present, the desired compound can be obtained—after removing the insoluble materials by filtration—by removing the solvent, e.g. by removing the solvent under reduced pressure, and/or by adding water to the residue and extracting the mixture with a water-immiscible organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, etc. Optionally, the desired compound can be obtained after drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate, for instance, and further, if necessary, by purifying with any conventional method, such as recrystallization, column chromatography, or other techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is evident that in the foregoing and in the exemplified reactions, the reaction products may be isolated from the reaction medium and, if necessary, further purified by methods generally known in the art, such as extraction, crystallization and chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe different compounds comprised by formula (I) may be converted into each other following functional group transformation reactions well known in the art. Preferably, they are obtained by utilizing suitable starting materials, like for example, compounds of formula (II) including already the desired substituent R\n3\n, or with compounds of formula (V) or (VI) including already the desired substituents R\n1 \nand R\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, in those compounds with hydroxy substitutents as R\n3\n, such hydroxy moieties may be converted into the corresponding C\n1-6 \nalkoxy by reacting the compounds with an C\n1-6\nalkyl halide in the presence of a base, such as an alkali of alkaline metal hydride, like lithium hydride or sodium hydride, or an alkali metal alkoxide, like sodium or potassium methoxide or ethoxide, potassium tert-butoxide, or potassium carbonate, triethylamine, pyridine, sodium iodide, cesium carbonate, etc. The C\n1-6\nalkyl halide may be selected, for instance, from methyl or ethyl iodide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, in those compounds with C\n1-6\nalkoxy substitutents as R\n3\n, such C\n1-6\nalkoxy moieties may be converted into the corresponding hydroxy by submitting the relevant compounds to acidic conditions, such as with hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, or hydroiodic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) of the present invention may be converted to the corresponding N-oxide forms following procedures known in the art for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its N-oxide form. The N-oxide forms of the present compounds are meant to comprise the compounds of formula (I) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called N-oxide. Said N-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting compound of formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarbo-peroxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzene-carboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. tert-butyl hydro-peroxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alcohols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention relates to those compounds of formula (IIb), per se,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nan N-oxide, salt, solvate or stereoisomer thereof, wherein,\n\n\neach R\n3 \nis independently hydroxy or C\n1-6\nalkoxy; and\n\n\nn is 2.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention relates to those compounds of formula (IIb′), per se,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nan N-oxide, salt, solvate or stereoisomer thereof, wherein,\n\n\nR\n3 \nis hydroxy; and\n\n\nn is selected from 1 and 2.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, the present invention relates to those compounds of formula (IIc), per se,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nan N-oxide, salt, solvate or stereoisomer thereof, wherein,\n\n\neach R\n3 \nis independently hydroxy or C\n1-6\nalkoxy; and\n\n\nn is selected from 0, 1, and 2.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the present invention relates to those compounds of formula (IV), per se,\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nan N-oxide, salt, solvate or stereoisomer thereof, wherein,\n\n\neach R\n3 \nis independently hydroxy or C\n1-6\nalkoxy;\n\n\nn is selected from 0, 1, and 2; and\n\n\nLG2 represents a leaving group.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, the invention refers to the use of the compounds of formula (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIb′), (IIc), and (IV), each independently, as intermediates in the preparation of a compound of formula (I), pharmaceutically acceptable salts, isomers, prodrugs, and solvates thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the present invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A therapeutically effective amount in this context is an amount sufficient to prophylactically act against, to stabilize or to treat a disease or condition mediated by a sigma receptor, in subjects suffering from such disease or condition. In still a further aspect, this invention relates to a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition as specified herein, which comprises intimately mixing a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier with a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, the compounds of the present invention may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the compounds of the present invention, optionally in a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers, such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents, powders, pills, capsules, and tablets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also be administered via oral inhalation or insufflation by means of methods and formulations employed in the art for administration via this way. Thus, in general the compounds of the present invention may be administered to the lungs in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry powder, a solution being preferred. Any system developed for the delivery of solutions, suspensions or dry powders via oral inhalation or insufflation are suitable for the administration of the present compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition adapted for administration by inhalation or insufflation through the mouth comprising a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compounds of the present invention may be administered via inhalation of a solution in nebulized or aerosolized doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will comprise, preferably, from 0.05 to 99% by weight, more preferably, from 0.1 to 70% by weight, or even more preferably, from 0.1 to 50% by weight of the active ingredient, and, from 1 to 99.95% by weight, more preferably, from 30 to 99.9% by weight, or even more preferably, from 50 to 99.9% by weight, of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, all percentages being based on the total composition weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, suppositories, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions, and segregated multiples thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe daily dosage of the compounds according to the invention will, of course, vary with the mode of administration, the treatment desired and the severity of the food intake disorder. However, in general, satisfactory results will be obtained when the compounds according to the invention are administered at a daily dosage in the range from 0.1 to 1000 mg/kg body weight, preferably from 1 to 1000 mg/kg, or more preferably, from 10 to 1000 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are suitable for the prevention or treatment of a sigma receptor mediated disease or condition. They are particularly suitable in preventing or treating pain, neuropathic pain, inflammatory pain, or other pain conditions involving allodynia and/or hyperalgesia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates thereof may therefore be used as a medicament.

The following protocols were followed:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBrain membrane preparation and binding assays for the 61-receptor were performed as described (DeHaven-Hudkins et al., 1992) with some modifications. In brief, guinea pig brains were homogenized in 10 vols. (w/v) of Tris-HCl 50 mM 0.32 M sucrose, pH 7.4, with a Kinematica Polytron PT 3000 at 15000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4° C. and the supernatants collected and centrifuged again at 48000 g for 15 min at 4° C. The pellet was re-suspended in 10 volumes of Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4), incubated at 37° C. for 30 min. and centrifuged at 48000 g for 20 min at 4° C. Following this, the pellet was re-suspended in fresh Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) and stored on ice until use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe radioligand used was [\n3\nH]-(+)-pentazocine at 3.0 nM and the final volume was 200 μl. The incubation was initiated with the addition of 100 μl of membrane at a final tissue concentration of approximately 5 mg tissue net weight/mL and the incubation time was 150 min. at 37° C. After incubation, the membranes were collected onto pre-treated glass fiber filter plate (MultiScreen-FC, Millipore), with polyethylenimine 0.1%. The filters were washed two times with 200 μl of washing buffer (50 mM Tris Cl, pH=7.4) and then 25 μl of Ecoscint H liquid scintillation cocktail were added. Microplates were allowed to set for several hours and then quantified by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry (1450 Microbeta, Wallac). Non-specific binding was determined with 1 μM haloperidol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Microbeta reader gave the counts per minute (cpm) per each well that were processed in Excel work sheet to obtain means of duplicates. The Specific Binding value was obtained subtracting Non-Specific Binding (NSB) from Total Binding (TB).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPercentages of Specific Bound for each different compound concentration were calculated from duplicates cpm means as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\n-\n\n\nNSB\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecific\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\nEquation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe values were used for non-linear IC\n50 \n(nM) calculation and graph representation.
