According to recent studies, more than 50 % of the U.S. population is considered overweight, with more than 25 % diagnosed as clinically obese and at considerable risk for heart disease, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), hypertension, and certain cancers. This epidemic presents a significant burden on the health care system as projected obesity treatment costs of more than $70 billion annually are expected in the U.S. alone. Strategies for treating obesity include reduction of food intake and enhancing the expenditure of energy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeuropeptide Y (NPY), a 36 amino acid peptide neurotransmitter, is a member of the pancreatic polypeptide class of neurotransmitters/neurohormones which has been shown to be present in both the periphery and central nervous system. NPY is one of the most potent orexogenic agents known and has been shown to play a major role in the regulation of food intake in animals, including humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFive neuropeptide Y receptors (NPY), the Y1-, Y2-, Y3-, Y4, and Y5- and Y6-subtypes, have been cloned, which belong to the rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled ,7-transmembrane helix- spanning receptors (GPCR). The NPY Y2 receptor (Y2R) is a 381 amino-acid which inhibits the activation of adenyl cyclase via G\ni\n while having low homology with other known NPY receptors. There is a high degree of conservation between rat and human Y2 receptor with 98 % amino acid identity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Y2R receptor is widely distributed within the central nervous system in both rodents and humans. In the hypothalamus, Y2 mRNA is localized in the arcuate nucleus, preoptic nucleus, and dorsomedial nucleus. In the human brain, Y2R is the predominant Y receptor subtype. Within the arcuate nuclease, over 80 % of the NPY neurons co-express Y2R mRNA. Application of a Y2-selective agonist has been shown to reduce the release of NPY from hypothalamic slices in vitro, whereas the Y2 non-peptide antagonist BIIE0246 increases NPY release. These findings support the role of Y2R as a presynaptic autoreceptor that regulates the NPY release and hence may be involved in the regulation of feeding. (\nPoter, E.K., et al. Eur. J. Pharmac. 267,253-262 (1994\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide YY \n3-36\n (PYY \n3-36\n) is a 33 amino acid linear peptide having specific neuropeptide Y2 (NPY2R) agonist activity. It has been demonstrated that Intra-arcuate (IC) or Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of PYY \n3-36\n reduced feeding in rats and, as a chronic treatment, reduced body weight gain. Intra-venous (IV) infusion (0.8 pmol/kg/min) for 90 min of PYY \n3-36\n reduced food intake in obese and normal human subjects 33 % over 24 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese finding suggest that the PYY system may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity. (\nBloom, S. et al, Nature Vol. 418, 8 August 2002 , P. 650-654\n). Further, a Cys\n2\n-(D)Cys\n27\n-cyclized version of PYY, in which residues 5-24 were replaced by a methylene-chain of 5 to 8 carbons in length, showed activation of the intestinal PYY receptor, as evidenced by reduced current across voltage-clamped mucosal preparations of rat jejunum. (\nKrstenansky, et al. in Peptides, Proceedings of the Twelfth American Peptide Symposium. J. Smith and J. Rivier Editors, ESCOM. Leiden Page 136-137\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, covalent modification of proteins with poly (ethylene glycol) or poly (ethylene oxide) (both referred to as PEG), was demonstrated with superoxide dismutase (\nSomack, R, et al., (1991) Free Rad Res Commun 12-13:553-562\n; \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 5,283,317\n \n and \n \n5,468,478\n \n) and for other types of proteins, e.g., cytokines (\nSaifer, M G P, et al., (1997) Polym Preprints 38:576-577\n; \nSherman, M R, et al., (1997) in J M Harris, et al., (Eds.), Poly(ethylene glycol) Chemistry and Biological Applications. ACS Symposium Series 680 (pp. 155-169) Washington, D.C.: American Chemical Society\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nBeck-Sickinger et al. (1992) Eur. J. Biochem. 206, 957-964\n\n\n; (\n\n\n1990) Eur J Biochem 194, 449-456\n\n\n; (\n\n\n1995) Biopolymers 37 123-142\n\n\n;\n\n\nBeck et. al (1989) FEBS Lett. 244, 119-122\n\n\n;\n\n\nKrstenansky et al.

(2002) Nature 418 650-654\n\n\ndiscloses the use of PYY\n\n\n\n\n3-36\n\n\n\n\nfor the treatment of obesity.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA need exists, however, for novel engineered analogs of PYY having significantly lower molecular weight, while possessing equal or better potency, pharmacokinetic properties and pharmacological properties as existing Y2R agonists. A need also exists for pegylated analogs of PYY in order to, for example, increase peptide half-life and reduce immunogenicity in subjects in need of such agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are also advantageous because they are truncated versions of the PYY\n3-36\n. Thus, the shorter peptides not only facilitate easier synthesis and purification of the compounds, but also improve and reduce manufacturing procedures and expenses. Moreover, the compounds of the invention will interact preferably with PYY receptors and not with homologous receptors such as NPY Y1, Y4 and Y5. Unwanted agonist or antagonist side reactions are, thereby, minimized.\n\n \n \n \n \nFigure 1\n shows a HPLC chromatogram of a compound of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 2\n shows a HPLC chromatogram of a compound of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 3\n shows a MALDI-TOF of a compound of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 4\n shows a HPLC chromatogram of another compound of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 5\n shows a HPLC chromatogram of a compound of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 6\n shows a MALDI-TOF of a compound of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 7\n shows a chart of the effects on food intake after administration of a compound of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 8\n shows a chart of the effects on food intake after administration of another compound of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 9\n shows a chart of the effects on food intake after administration of a yet another compound of the present invention.\n \n \nFigure 10\n shows a chart of the effects on food intake after administration of a still another compound of the present invention.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAll peptide sequences mentioned herein are written according to the usual convention whereby the N-terminal amino acid is on the left and the C-terminal amino acid is on the right, unless noted otherwise.

Trifluoroacetic acid was purchased from Halocarbon or Fluka and used without further purification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) and diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) was purchased from Fluka or Aldrich and used without further purification. Hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) dimethylsulfide (DMS) and 1, 2-ethanedithiol (EDT) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. and used without further purification. Protected amino acids were generally of the L configuration and were obtained commercially from Bachem, or Neosystem. Purity of these reagents was confirmed by thin layer chromatography, NMR and melting point prior to use. Benzhydrylamine resin (BHA) was a copolymer of styrene - 1 % divinylbenzene (100-200 or 200-400 mesh) obtained from Bachem or Advanced Chemtech. Total nitrogen content of these resins were generally between 0.3 - 1.2 meq/g.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was conducted on a LDC apparatus consisting of Constametric I and III pumps, a Gradient Master solvent programmer and mixer, and a Spectromonitor III variable wavelength UV detector. Analytical HPLC was performed in reversed phase mode using Vydac C\n18\n columns (0.4 x 30 cm). Preparative HPLC separations were run on Vaydac columns (2 x 25 cm).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, peptides were prepared using solid phase synthesis by the method generally described by Merrifield, (J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 85, 2149 (1963)), although other equivalent chemical synthesis known in the art could be used as previously mentioned. Solid phase synthesis is commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha-amino acid to a suitable resin. Such a starting material can be prepared by attaching an alpha-amino-protected amino acid by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin, or by an amide bond between an Fmoc-Linker, such as p- ((R, S)-α-(1-(9H-fluoren-9-yl)-methoxyformamido)-2,4-dimethyloxybenzyl)-phenoxyacetic acid (Rink linker) to a benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin. Preparation of the hydroxymethyl resin is well known in the art. Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin supports are commercially available and generally used when the desired peptide being synthesized has an unsubstituted amide at the C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, the amino acids or mimetic are coupled onto the Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin using the Fmoc protected form of amino acid or mimetic, with 2-5 equivalents of amino acid and a suitable coupling reagent. After couplings, the resin may be washed and dried under vacuum. Loading of the amino acid onto the resin may be determined by amino acid analysis of an aliquot of Fmoc-amino acid resin or by determination of Fmoc groups by UV analysis. Any unreacted amino groups may be capped by reacting the resin with acetic anhydride and diispropylethylamine in methylene chloride.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resins are carried through several repetitive cycles to add amino acids sequentially. The alpha amino Fmoc protecting groups are removed under basic conditions. Piperidine, piperazine or morpholine (20-40% v/v) in DMF may be used for this purpose. Preferably 40% piperidine in DMF is utilized\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing the removal of the alpha amino protecting group, the subsequent protected amino acids are coupled stepwise in the desired order to obtain an intermediate, protected peptide-resin. The activating reagents used for coupling of the amino acids in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the art. For example, appropriate reagents for such syntheses are benzotriazol-1-yloxy-tri- (dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), Bromo-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBroP) 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), and diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC). Preferred here are HBTU and DIC. Other activating agents are described by \nBarany and Merrifield (in The Peptides, Vol. 2, J. Meienhofer, ed., Academic Press, 1979, pp 1-284\n) may be utilized. Various reagents such as 1 hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), N-hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) and 3,4-dihydro-3-hydroxy-4-oxo-1, 2, 3-benzotriazine (HOOBT) may be added to the coupling mixtures in order to optimize the synthetic cycles. Preferred here is HOBT.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protocol for a typical synthetic cycle is as follows:\n\n\n \n \nProtocol\n 1\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nStep\n \n \nReagent\n\n\nTime\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nDMF\n\n\n2 x 30 \nsec\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n20% piperidine/\nDMF\n \n\n\n1 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n20% piperidine/\nDMF\n \n\n\n15 \nmin\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nDMF\n\n\n2 x 30 \nsec\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\niPrOH\n\n\n2 x 30 \nsec\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nDMF\n\n\n3 x 30 sec\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n \ncoupling\n \n\n\n60 min - 18 \nhours\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nDMF\n\n\n2 x 30 \nsec\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\niPrOH\n\n\n1 x 30 \nsec\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nDMF\n\n\n1 x 30 sec\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nCH\n2\nCl\n2\n \n\n\n2 x 30 sec\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolvents for all washings and couplings were measured to volumes of 10 - 20 ml/g resins. Coupling reactions throughout the synthesis were monitored by the Kaiser Ninhydrin test to determine extent of completion (\nKaiser et at. Anal.Biochem.34, 595-598 (1970\n)). Slow reaction kinetics was observed for Fmoc-Arg (Pmc) and for couplings to secondary amines by sterically hindered acids. Any incomplete coupling reactions were either recoupled with freshly prepared activated amino acid or capped by treating the peptide resin with acetic anhydride as described above. The fully assembled peptide-resins were dried in vacuum for several hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor each compound, the blocking groups were removed and the peptide cleaved from the resin. For example, the peptide-resins were treated with 100 µL ethanedithiol, 100 µl dimethylsulfide, 300 µL anisole, and 9.5 mL trifluoroacetic acid, per gram of resin, at room temperature for 180 min. Or alternately the peptide-resins were treated with 1.0 mL triisopropyl silane and 9.5 mL trifluoroacetic acid, per gram of resin, at room temperature for 180 min. The resin is filtered off and the filtrates are precipitated in chilled ethyl ether. The precipitates are centrifuged and the ether layer is decanted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe residue was washed with two or three volumes of Et\n2\nO and recentrifuged. The crude products were dried under vacuum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification of the crude peptides were performed on Shimadzu LC-8A system by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a reverse phase Vydac C-18 Column (50x250 mm. 300 A, 10-15 µm). The peptides were injected to the columns in a minimum volume of either 0.1 AcOH/H\n2\nO or CH3CH/H\n2\nO. Gradient elution was generally started at 2% B buffer, 2% -70% B over 70 minutes, (buffer A: 0.1% TFA/H\n2\nO; buffer B: 0.1% TFA/CH\n3\nCN) at a flow rate of 50 ml/min. UV detection was made at 220/280 nm. The fractions containing the products were separated and their purity was judged on Shimadzu LC-10AT analytical system using reverse phase Ace C18 column (4.6 x50mm) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min., gradient (2-70 %) over 10 min.(buffer A: 0.1% TFA/H\n2\nO buffer B: 0.1% TFA/CH\n3\nCN)). Fractions judged to be of high purity were pooled and lyophilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurity of the final products was checked by analytical HPLC on a reversed phase column as stated above. Purity of all products was judged to be approximately 95 - 99%. All final products were also subjected to fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) or electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS). All products yielded the expected parent M+H ions within acceptable limits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgonists of Y2R cause reduction of food intake in mouse models of human obesity. Therefore, administration of these compounds agonize Y2 receptor activity, which is important for the reduction of food intake and regulation of body weight. According to the in vivo activity experiments in Example 78, reduction of food intake was demonstrated for selected analogs of the invention (those of Examples 5, 44, 73 and 74) and the results summarized in \nFigures 7\n, \n8\n, \n9\n and \n10\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be provided in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of preferred salts are those formed with pharmaceutically acceptable organic acids, e.g., acetic, lactic, maleic, citric, malic, ascorbic, succinic, benzoic, salicylic, methanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, trifluoroacetic, or pamoic acid, as well as polymeric acids such as tannic acid or carboxymethyl cellulose, and salts with inorganic acids, such as hydrohalic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid), sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid and the like. Any procedure for obtaining a pharmaceutically acceptable salt known to a skilled artisan can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, the novel compounds of the present invention have been found to be agonists of neuropeptide-2 receptor. The compounds of the present invention can therefore be used in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases which are modulated by neuropeptide-2 receptor agonists, particularly obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention therefore also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound as defined above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or adjuvant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention likewise embraces compounds as described above for use as therapeutically active substances, especially as therapeutically active substances for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases which are modulated by neuropeptide -2 receptor agonists, particularly as therapeutically active substances for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of diseases which are modulated by neuropeptide -2 receptor agonists, particularly for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of obesity, which method comprises administering a compound as defined above to a human being or animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also embraces the use of compounds as defined above for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of diseases which are modulated by neuropeptide -2 receptor agonists, particularly for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to the use of compounds as described above for the preparation of medicaments for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of diseases which are modulated by neuropeptide -2 receptor agonists, particularly for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of obesity. Such medicaments comprise a compound as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the practice of the method of the present invention, an effective amount of any one of the peptides of this invention or a combination of any of the peptides of this invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is administered via any of the usual and acceptable methods known in the art, either singly or in combination. The compounds or compositions can thus be administered orally (e.g., buccal cavity), sublingually, parenterally (e.g., intramuscularly, intravenously; or subcutaneously), rectally (e.g., by suppositories or washings), transdermally (e.g., skin electroporation) or by inhalation (e.g., by aerosol), and in the form or solid, liquid or gaseous dosages, including tablets and suspensions. The administration can be conducted in a single unit dosage form with continuous therapy or in a single dose therapy ad libitum. The therapeutic composition can also be in the form of an oil emulsion or dispersion in conjunction with a lipophilic salt such as pamoic acid, or in the form of a biodegradable sustained-release composition for subcutaneous or intramuscular administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the method of the present invention is practiced when relief of symptoms is specifically required or perhaps imminent. Alternatively, the method of the present invention is effectively practiced as continuous or prophylactic treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful pharmaceutical carriers for the preparation of the compositions hereof, can be solids, liquids or gases; thus, the compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, suppositories, powders, enterically coated or other protected formulations (e.g. binding on ion-exchange resins or packaging in lipid-protein vesicles), sustained release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, and the like. The carrier can be selected from the various oils including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. Water, saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols are preferred liquid carriers, particularly (when isotonic with the blood) for injectable solutions. For example, formulations for intravenous administration comprise sterile aqueous solutions of the active ingredient(s) which are prepared by dissolving solid active ingredient(s) in water to produce an aqueous solution, and rendering the solution sterile. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, talc, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The compositions may be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical additives such as preservatives, stabilizing agents, wetting or emulsifying agents, salts for adjusting osmotic pressure, buffers and the like. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulation are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will, in any event, contain an effective amount of the active compound together with a suitable carrier so as to prepare the proper dosage form for proper administration to the recipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose of a compound of the present invention depends on a number of factors, such as, for example, the manner of administration, the age and the body weight of the subject, and the condition of the subject to be treated, and ultimately will be decided by the attending physician or veterinarian. Such an amount of the active compound as determined by the attending physician or veterinarian is referred to herein, and in the claims, as an \"effective amount\". For example, the dose for intranasal administration is typically in the range of about 1 to about 100 mg/kg body weight; and the dose for subcutaneous administration is typically in the range of about 0.001 to about 50 mg/kg body weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the dose of a compound of the present invention is from about 2.5 to about 10 mg/kg. Most preferably, the dosages are about 2.5, about 5 and about 10 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention will now be further described in the Examples which follow, which are intended as an illustration only and do not limit the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation of Fmoc-Linker-BHA Resin\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBenzhydrylamine copolystyrene-1 % divinylbenzene cross-linked resin (10.0 g, 9.3 mequiv, 100-200 ASTM mesh, Advanced ChemTech) was swelled in 100 mL CH2Cl2, filtered and washed successively with 100 ml each of CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, 6% DIPEA/CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (two times), CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (two times). The resin was treated with p- ((R, S)-α-(1-(9H-fluoren-9-yl)-methoxyformamido)-2, 4-dimethoxybenzyl)-phenoxyacetic acid (Fmoc-Linker) (7.01 g, 13.0 mmole), N-hydroxybenzotriazole (2.16g, 16.0mmole), and diisopropyl-carbodiimide (2.04 ml, 13.0 mmol) in 100 \nmL\n 25% DMF/CH\n2\nCl\n2\n for 24 hours at room temperature. The resin was filtered and washed successively with 100 ml each of CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (two times), isopropanol (two times), DMF, and CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (three times). A Kaiser Ninhydrin analysis was negative. The resin was dried under vacuum to yield 16.12 g of Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin. A portion of this resin (3.5 mg) was subjected to Fmoc deprotection and quantitative UV analysis which indicated a loading of 0.56 mmol/g.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtocol for the synthesis of peptides by Applied Biosystem 433A synthesizer using Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor a 0.25 mmol scale peptide synthesis by Applied Biosystem 433A synthesizer (Foster City, CA), the FastMoc 0.25 mmole cycles were used with either the resin sampling or non resin sampling, 41 mL reaction vessel. The Fmoc-amino acid resin was dissolved with 2.1 g NMP, 2g of 0.45M HOBT/HBTU in DMF and 2M DIEA, then transferred to the reaction vessel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe basic FastMoc coupling cycle was represented by the module \"BADEIFD,\" wherein each letter represents a module. For example:\n\n \n \n \nB represents the module for Fmoc deprotection using 20% Piperidine/NMP and related washes and readings for 30 min (either UV monitoring or conductivity);\n \nA represents the module for activation of amino acid in cartridges with 0.45 M. HBTU/HOBt and 2.0 M DIEA and mixing with N\n2\n bubbling;\n \nD represents the module for NMP washing of resin in the reaction vessel;\n \nE represents the module for transfer of the activated amino acid to the reaction vessel for coupling;\n \nI represents the module for a 10 minute waiting period with vortexing on and off of the reaction vessel; and\n \nF represents the module for cleaning cartridge, coupling for approximately 10 minutes and draining the reaction vessel.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nCouplings were typically extended by addition of module \"I\" once or multiple times. For example, double couplings were run by performing the procedure \"BADEIIADEIFD.\" Other modules were available such as c for methylene chloride washes and \"C\" for capping with acetic anhydride. Individual modules were also modifiable by, for example, changing the timing of various functions, such as transfer time, in order to alter the amount of solvent or reagents transferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cycles above were typically used for coupling one amino acid. For synthesizing tetra peptides, however, the cycles were repeated and strung together. For example, BADEIIADEIFD was used to couple the first amino acid, followed by BADEDADEIFD to couple the second amino acid, followed by BADEIIADEIFD to couple the third amino acid, followed by BADEIIADEIFD to couple the fourth amino acid, followed by BIDDcc for final deprotection and washing.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\n\n\n \nPreparation of H-Tyr-Pro-Ile-Lys-Pro-Glu-Ala-Pro-Gly-Glu-Asp-Ala-Ser-Pro-Glu-Glu-Leu-Asn-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Ala-Ser-Leu-Arg-His-Tyr-Leu-Asn-Leu-Val-Thr-Arg-Gln-Arg-Tyr-NH\n2\n (PYY \n1-36\n)\n (SEQ ID NO: 3)\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above peptide was synthesized using Fmoc chemistry on an Applied Biosystem 433A synthesizer. The synthesizer was programmed for double coupling using the modules described in Example 2. The synthesis was carried out on a 0.25 mmol scale using the Fmoc- Linker-BHA resin (450 mg, 0.25 mmol) from Example 1. At the end of the synthesis, the resin was transferred to a reaction vessel on a shaker for cleavage. The peptide was cleaved from the resin using 13.5 mL 97% TFA/ 3%H2O and 1.5mL triisopropylsilane for 180 minutes at room temperature. The deprotection solution was added to 100 mL cold ET\n2\nO and washed with 1 mL TFA and 30 mL cold ET\n2\nO to precipitate the peptide. The peptide was centrifuged 2x50 mL polypropylene tubes. The precipitates from the individual tubes were combined in a single tube and washed 3 times with cold ET\n2\nO and dried in a desiccator under house vacuum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe crude material was purified by preparative HPLC on a Pursuit C18-Column (250x50mm, 10µm particle size) and eluted with a linear gradient of 2-70%B (buffer A: 0.1%TFA/H2O; buffer B: 0.1% TFA/CH3CN) in 90 min., flow rate 60mL/min,and detection 220/280 nm. The fractions were collected and were checked by analytical HPLC. Fractions containing pure product were combined and lyophilized to yield 65 mg (6%) of a white amorphous powder.

C57BL/6J male mice or DIO (diet-induced obese) male mice were used in the experiments; with eight mice per experimental group. The mice were maintained on a regular light cycle (6 AM - ON; 6 PM - OFF). The mice were fasted for 24 hours prior to testing with ad lib access to water. During the test, mice were housed one per cage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Examples 5 and 44 were administered intraperitoneally; and the compounds of Examples 73 and 74 were administered subcutaneously. Food intake was measured 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours after dosing and the results presented in \nFigures 7 to 10\n. Food intake was measured for longer time intervals for the compounds of Examples 73 and 74, and shown in \nFigures 9\n and \n10\n. In each Figure, cumulative and time interval food consumptions were measured in individual mice. Mean food consumption and percent change from vehicle were calculated for each time interval. Data was analyzed by using two-tailed Student t-test. \nFigures 7 to 10\n show that the compounds of the present invention are effective in reducing food intake when compared to controls.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 79\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaFlux Assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHek-293 cells were stably transfected with the G protein chimera Gaqi9 and the hygromycin-B resistance gene were further transfected with the human NPY2 receptor and G418 antibiotic selection. Following selection in both hygromycin-B and G418, individual clones were assayed for their response to PYY. The transfected cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50µg/ml hygromycin-B 2mM glutamine, 100U/ml penicillin, 100µg/ml streptomycin and 250µg/ml G418. Cells are harvested with trypsin-EDTA and counted using ViaCount reagent. The cell suspension volume is adjusted to 4.8x10\n5\n cells /ml with complete growth media. Aliquots of 25µL are dispensed into 384 well Poly-D Lysine coated black/clear microplates (Falcon) and the microplates were placed in a 37°C CO\n2\n incubator overnight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLoading Buffer (Calcium-3 Assay Kit, Molecular Devices) was prepared by dissolving the contents of one vial (Express Kit) into 1000 ml Hank's Balanced Salt Solution containing 20mM HEPES and 5mM probenecid. Aliquots of 25µL of diluted dye was dispensed into the cell plates and the plates are then incubated for 1 hour at 37°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring the incubation, test compounds were prepared at 3.5X the desired concentration in HBSS(20mM HEPES)/0.05%BSA/1%DMSO and transferred to a 384 well plate for use on FL1PR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter incubation, both the cell and compound plates were brought to the FLIPR and 20µL of the diluted compounds were transferred to the cell plates by the FLIPR. During the assay, fluorescence readings were taken simultaneously from all 384 wells of the cell plate every 1.5 seconds. Five readings were taken to establish a stable baseline, and then 20µL of sample was rapidly (30µL/sec) and simultaneously added to each well of the cell plate. The fluorescence was continuously monitored before, during and after sample addition for a total elapsed time of 100 seconds. Responses (increase in peak fluorescence) in each well following addition was determined. The initial fluorescence reading from each well, prior to ligand stimulation, was used as a zero baseline value for the data from that well. The responses are expressed as % of maximal response of the positive control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention exhibited selective Neuropeptide -2 receptor activity in vitro, as demonstrated in the cAMP assay (Example 77) and CaFlux Assay (FLIPR) (Example 78).
