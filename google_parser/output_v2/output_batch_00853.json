Description\n\n\n\n\n SUBSTITUTED SPIROCYCLIC PIPERIDINE DERIVATIVES AS HISTAMINE-\n\n\n3 (H\n3\n) RECEPTOR LIGANDS\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is related to substituted spirocyclic piperidine derivatives, their use as H\n3\n antagonists/inverse agonists, processes for their preparation, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nPublications cited throughout this disclosure are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.\n\n\nHistamine is a well established modulator of neuronal activity. At least four subtypes of histamine receptors have been reported in the literature - Hi, H\n2\n, H\n3\n, H\n4\n. The histamine H\n3\n receptors play a key role in neurotransmission in the central nervous system. The H\n3\n receptor was discovered in 1983 originally, on histamine-containing neurons where it was shown to function presynaptically, regulating the release and synthesis of the biogenic amine histamine (Arrang et al, 1983) now a well established neurotransmitter. H\n3\n receptors are predominately expressed in the brain, localizing to the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus and hypothalamus. H\n3\n receptors are also localized presynaptically on histaminergic nerve terminals and act as inhibitory autoreceptors (Alguacil and Perez-Garcia, 2003; Passani et al, 2004; Leurs at al, 2005; Celanire et al, 2005; Witkin and Nelson, 2004). When these receptors are activated by histamine, histamine release is inhibited. H\n3\n receptors can also be found in the periphery (skin, lung, cardiovascular system, intestine, GI tract, etc). H\n3\n receptors are also involved in presynaptic regulation of the release of acetylcholine, dopamine, GABA, glutamate and serotonin (see Repka-Ramirez, 2003; Chazot and Hann, 2001; Leurs et al, 1998). The H\n3\n receptor demonstrates a high degree of constitutive or spontaneous activity (e.g., receptor is active in the absence of agonist stimulation) in vitro and in vivo, thus, ligands to the receptor can display, agonist, neutral antagonist or inverse agonist effects.\n\n\nThe location and function of histaminergic neurons in the CNS suggests that compounds interacting with the H\n3\n receptor may have utility in a number of therapeutic \n\n applications including narcolepsy or sleep/wake disorders, feeding behavior, eating disorders, obesity, cognition, arousal, memory, mood disorders, mood attention alteration, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease/dementia, schizophrenia, pain, stress, migraine, motion sickness, depression, psychiatric disorders and epilepsy (Leurs et al, 2005; Witkin and Nelson, 2004, Hancock and Fox 2004; Esbenshade et al. 2006). An H\n3\n antagonist/inverse agonist could be important for gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory disorders such as asthma, inflammation, and myocardial infarction.\n\n\nOhtake et al. (US 2006/0178375 Al) disclosed compounds that reportedly exhibit histamine receptor H\n3\n antagonist or inverse agonist activity and may be useful for the treatment or prevention of obesity, diabetes, hormonal secretion abnormality, or sleep disorders.\n\n\nCelanire et al.(WO 2006/103057 Al and WO 2006/103045) have disclosed compounds comprising an oxazoline or thiazoline moiety, processes for preparing them, their pharmaceutical compositions and their uses as H\n3\n ligands.\n\n\nBertrand et al. (WO 2006/117609 A2) disclosed novel histamine H\n3\n receptor ligands, processes for their preparation, and their therapeutic applications.\n\n\nSchwartz et al. (WO 2006/103546 A2) disclosed certain methods of treatment for Parkinson's disease, obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, dementia with Lewy bodies, and/or vascular dementia using non-imidazole alkylamine derivatives that are antagonists of the H\n3\n receptors of histamine.\n\n\nApodaca et al. (EP 1 311 482 Bl) disclosed certain non-imidazole aryloxypiperidines as H\n3\n receptor ligands, their synthesis, and their use for the treatment of disorders and conditions mediated by the histamine receptor. Xu et al. disclosed certain 6-substituted phenyl-4,5-dihydro-3(2H)-pyridazinones, their synthesis, and rabbit platelet aggregation inhibitory activity induced by ADP in vitro.\n\n\nBarker et al. (US 2006/0217375) discloses spiro[benzodioxane] compounds as active antagonists of the orexin-1 receptor and potentially useful in the prophylaxis and treatment of orexin-1 recpetor related disorders and orexin-2 receptor related disorders.\n\n\nThus, there is a need for novel classes of compounds that possess the beneficial properties.

Useful methods of resolving and recovering specific stereoisomers described in Eli el, E. L.; Wilen, S. H. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds; Wiley: New York, 1994, and Jacques, J, et al. Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions; Wiley: New York, 1981, each incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. It is further recognized that functional groups present on the compounds of\n\n\nFormula I may contain protecting groups. For example, the amino acid side chain substituents of the compounds of Formula I can be substituted with protecting groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl groups. Protecting groups are known \n\n per se as chemical functional groups that can be selectively appended to and removed from functionalities, such as hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups. These groups are present in a chemical compound to render such functionality inert to chemical reaction conditions to which the compound is exposed. Any of a variety of protecting groups may be employed with the present invention. Preferred groups for protecting lactams include silyl groups such as t-butyldimethylsilyl (\"TBDMS\"), dimethoxybenzhydryl (\"DMB\"), acyl, benzyl (\"Bn\"), and methoxybenzyl groups. Preferred groups for protecting hydroxy groups include TBS, acyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (\"CBZ\"), t- butyloxycarbonyl (\"Boc\"), and methoxymethyl. Many other standard protecting groups employed by one skilled in the art can be found in Greene, T.W. and Wuts, P.G.M., \"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis\" 2d. Ed., Wiley & Sons, 1991.\n\n\nSynthesis\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may be prepared in a number of methods well known to those skilled in the art, including, but not limited to those described below, or through modifications of these methods by applying standard techniques known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis.

The rat H\n3\n receptor cDNA was PCR amplified from reverse-transcribed RNA pooled from rat thalamus, hypothalamus, striatum and prefrontal cortex with a sequence corresponding to bp #338- 1672 of Genbank file #NM_053506, encoding the entire 445-amino-acid rat histamine H\n3\n receptor. This was engineered into the pIRES-neo3 mammalian expression vector, which was stably transfected into the CH0-A3 cell line (Euroscreen, Belgium), followed by clonal selection by limiting dilution. Cells were harvested and cell pellets were frozen (-80° C). Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 with 5 nM EDTA and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitior Tablets, Roche Diagnostics). Cells were disrupted using a polytron cell homogenizer and the suspension was centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 minutes at 4\n0\nC. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 30 min at 4°C. This membrane pellet was washed in membrane buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 with 0.6 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n and protease inhibitors, recentrifuged as above and the final pellet resuspended in membrane buffer plus 250 mM sucrose and frozen at -8O\n0\nC.\n\n\nRadioligand Binding. Membranes were resuspended in 50 mM Tris HCl (pH\n\n\n7.4), 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.1% BSA. The membrane suspensions (10 μg protein per well) were incubated in a 96 well microtiter plate with [\n3\nH]-N-alpha-methylhistamine (approximately 1 nM final concentration), test compounds at various concentrations ( 0.01 nM - 30 μM) and scintillation proximity beads (Perkin Elmer, FlashBlueGPCR Scintillating Beads) in a final volume of 80 μl for 4 hours at room temperature, protected from light. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM clobenpropit. \n\n Radioligand bound to receptor, and therefore in proximity to the scintillation beads, was measured using a MicroBeta scintillation counter.\n\n\nGTPyS Binding. Membranes were resuspended in 20 mM BEPES pH 7.4 containing: 1 mM EDTA, 0.17 mg/ml dithiothreitol, 100 mM NaCl, 30 μg/ml saponin and 5 mM MgCl\n2\n. For measurement of inverse agonist activity, increasing concentrations of test compounds were incubated in a 96 well microtiter plate with 10 μg/well membrane protein, 5 μM GDP, scintillation proximity beads (Perkin Elmer, FlashBlueGPCR Scintillating Beads) and [\n35\nS]-GTPγS (0.1 nM final concentration). Following incubation for 45 minutes in the dark at room temperature, the microtiter plate was centrifuged at 1000 x g for 5 minutes and radioactivity bound to the membranes was counted using a MicroBeta scintillation counter. Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of 10 μM GTP. A decrease in bound [\n35\nS]-GTPyS is indicative of H\n3\n receptor inverse agonist activity in this assay. Antagonist activity of test compounds was determined in a similar experiment under the following conditions. Membranes were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 containing: 1 mM EDTA, 0.17 mg/ml dithiothreitol, 200 mM NaCl, 30 μg/ml saponin and 20 mM MgCl\n2\n. The membranes were incubated at 10 μg/well membrane protein in a microtiter plate with increasing concentrations of test compounds, 20 μM GDP, scintillation proximity beads and [\n35\nS]- GTPγS (0.1 nM final concentration) plus 30 nM R-alpha-methylhistamine. The microtiter plates were incubated and processed as described above. A decrease in R- alpha-methylhistamine stimulated [\n35\nS]-GTPyS binding is indicative of H\n3\n receptor antagonist activity in this assay.

R., Ed.; Lippincott Williams & Wilkins: Philadelphia, PA, 2000. The compositions may be formulated to control and/or delay the release of the active agent(s), as in fast-dissolve, modified-release, or sustained-release \n\n formulations. Such controlled-release, or extended-release compositions may utilize, for example biocompatible, biodegradable lactide polymers, lactide/glycolide copolymers, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers, or other solid or semisolid polymeric matrices known in the art. The compositions can be prepared for administration by oral means; parenteral means, including intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous routes; topical or transdermal means; transmucosal means, including rectal, vaginal, sublingual and buccal routes; ophthalmic means; or inhalation means. Preferably the compositions are prepared for oral administration, particularly in the form of tablets, capsules or syrups; for parenteral administration, particularly in the form of liquid solutions, suspensions or emulsions; for intranasal administration, particularly in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols; or for topical administration, such as creams, ointments, solutions, suspensions aerosols, powders and the like.\n\n\nFor oral administration, the tablets, pills, powders, capsules, troches and the like can contain one or more of the following: diluents or fillers such as starch, or cellulose; binders such as microcrystalline cellulose, gelatins, or polyvinylpyrrolidones; disintegrants such as starch or cellulose derivatives; lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate; glidants such as colloidal silicon dioxide; sweetening agents such as sucrose or saccharin; or flavoring agents such as peppermint or cherry flavoring. Capsules may contain any of the afore listed excipients, and may additionally contain a semi-solid or liquid carrier, such as a polyethylene glycol. The solid oral dosage forms may have coatings of sugar, shellac, or enteric agents. Liquid preparations may be in the form of aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, elixirs, etc., or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as surfactants, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, diluents, sweetening and flavoring agents, dyes and preservatives.\n\n\nThe compositions may also be administered parenterally. The pharmaceutical forms acceptable for injectable use include, for example, sterile aqueous solutions, or suspensions. Aqueous carriers include mixtures of alcohols and water, buffered media, and the like. Nonaqueous solvents include alcohols and glycols, such as ethanol, and polyethylene glycols; oils, such as vegetable oils; fatty acids and fatty acid esters, and the like. Other components can be added including surfactants; such as \n\n hydroxypropylcellulose; isotonic agents, such as sodium chloride; fluid and nutrient replenishes; electrolyte replenishers; agents which control the release of the active compounds, such as aluminum monostearate, and various co-polymers; antibacterial agents, such as chlorobutanol, or phenol; buffers, and the like. The parenteral preparations can be enclosed in ampules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials. Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for the active compounds include ethylene- vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposomes.\n\n\nOther possible modes of administration include formulations for inhalation, which include such means as dry powder, aerosol, or drops. They may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or oily solutions for administration in the form of nasal drops, or as a gel to be applied intranasally. Formulations for topical use are in the form of an ointment, cream, or gel. Typically these forms include a carrier, such as petrolatum, lanolin, stearyl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, or their combinations, and either an emulsifying agent, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, or a gelling agent, such as tragacanth. Formulations suitable for transdermal administration can be presented as discrete patches, as in a reservoir or microreservoir system, adhesive diffusion-controlled system or a matrix dispersion-type system. Formulations for buccal administration include, for example lozenges or pastilles and may also include a flavored base, such as sucrose or acacia, and other excipients such as glycocholate. Formulations suitable for rectal administration are preferably presented as unit-dose suppositories, with a solid based carrier, such as cocoa butter, and may include a salicylate.\n\n\nAs those skilled in the art will appreciate, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein, and the scope of the invention is intended to encompass all such variations.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nAlguacil L.

Description\n\n\n\n\n TITLE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nHEXAHYDROCYCLOPENTYL[Z]INDAZOLE 5-HYDROXYMETHYL ETHANOLS AND\n\n\nDERIVATIVES THEREOF AS SELECTIVE GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR MODULATORS\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIntracellular receptors (IRs) are a class of structurally related proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression. The steroid hormone receptors are a subset of this superfamily whose natural ligands are typically comprised of endogenous steroids such as estradiol, progesterone, and Cortisol. Man-made ligands to these receptors play an important role in human health and, of these receptors, the glucocorticoid receptor has an essential role in regulating human physiology and immune response. Steroids that interact with the glucocorticoid receptor have been shown to be potent anti-inflammatory agents. The present invention is directed to a novel class of compounds that are selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators that have potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity and possess advantages over steroidal glucocorticoid ligands with respect to side effects, efficacy, toxicity and/or metabolism.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention encompasses compounds of Formula I:\n\n\n \n\n or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or hydrates thereof, which are useful as selective glucocorticoid receptor ligands for treating a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases or conditions.

Such acids include acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and the like. Particularly preferred are citric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, maleic, phosphoric, sulfuric, and tartaric acids.\n\n\nIt will be understood that in the discussion of methods of treatment which follows, references to the compounds of Formula I, Ia, or Ib are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts.\n\n\nThe magnitude of prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of Formula I, Ia, or Ib will, of course, vary with the nature and the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound of Formula I, Ia, or Ib and its route of administration. It will also vary according to a variety of factors including the age, weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and response of the individual patient. In general, the daily dose from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kg body weight of a mammal, \n\n preferably 0.01 mg to about 10 mg per kg. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases.\n\n\nThe amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain from about 0.5 mg to about 5 g of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain from about 1 mg to about 2 g of an active ingredient, typically 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, or 1000 mg.\n\n\nFor the treatment of glucocorticoid receptor mediated diseases the compound of Formula I, Ia, or Ib may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. In addition to the treatment of warm-blooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, cats, etc., the compound of the invention is effective in the treatment of humans.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, solutions, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavouring agents, colouring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the U.S. Patent 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. \n\n Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water- miscible solvents such as propylene glycol, PEGs and ethanol, or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.\n\n\nAqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p- hydroxybenzoate, one or more colouring agents, one or more flavouring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.\n\n\nOily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.\n\n\nDispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil- in- water emulsion. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation \n\n products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxy ethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents.\n\n\nSyrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a perservative and flavouring and colouring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Cosolvents such as ethanol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols may also be used. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\nThe compounds of Formula I, Ia, or Ib may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ambient temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\nFor topical use, creams, ointments, gels, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing a compound of Formula I, Ia, or Ib are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.) Topical formulations may generally be comprised of a pharmaceutical carrier, cosolvent, emulsifier, penetration enhancer, preservative system, and emollient.\n\n\nThe ability of the compounds of Formula I, Ia, or Ib to selectively modulate glucocorticoid receptors makes them useful for treating, preventing or reversing the progression of a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and conditions. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful to treat, prevent or ameliorate the following diseases or conditions: inflammation, tissue rejection, auto-immunity, various malianancies, such as leukemias and lymphomas, Cushing's syndrome, acute adrenal insufficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, rheumatic fever, polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatous polyarteritis, inhibition of myeloid cell lines, immune proliferation/apoptosis, HPA axis suppression and regulation, hypercortisolemia, stroke and spinal cord injury, hypercalcemia, hypergylcemia, acute adrenal insufficiency, chronic primary \n\n adrenal insufficiency, secondary adrenal insufficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, cerebral edema, thrombocytopenia, Little's syndrome, obesity and metabolic syndrome.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are also useful for treating, preventing or reversing the progression of disease states involving systemic inflammation such as inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyartitis nodosa, Wegener's granulomatosis, giant cell arteritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, uveitis, hay fever, allergic rhinitis, urticaria, angioneurotic edema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, tendonitis, bursitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, organ transplantation, hepatitis, and cirrhosis.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are useful for treating, preventing or reversing the progression of a variety of topical diseases such as inflammatory scalp alopecia, panniculitis, psoriasis, discoid lupus erythematosus, inflamed cysts, atopic dermatitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, pemphigus vulgaris, buflous pemphigoid, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, herpes gestationis, eosinophilic fasciitis, relapsing polychondritis, inflammatory vasculitis, sarcoidosis, Sweet's disease, type I reactive leprosy, capillary hemangiomas, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, lichen planus, exfoliative dermatitus, erythema nodosum, acne, hirsutism, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiform, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are also useful in treating, preventing or reversing the progression of disease states associated with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), cell apoptosis, and cancer including, but not limited to, Kaposi's sarcoma, immune system activation and modulation, desensitization of inflammatory responses, IIL-I expression, natural killer cell development, lymphocytic leukemia, and treatment of retinitis pigmentosa. Cognitive and behavioral processes are also susceptible to glucocorticoid therapy where antagonists would potentially be useful in the treatment of processes such as cognitive performance, memory and learning enhancement, depression, addiction, mood disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome, schizophrenia, stroke, sleep disorders, and anxiety.\n\n\nThe invention also encompasses a method for treating a glucocorticoid receptor mediated disease comprising concomitantly administering to a patient in need of such treatment a compound of Formula I, Ia, or Ib and one or additional more agents.

In some cases (e.g. Examples 2a and 2b), the two diastereoisomers were separated at the last step after the TIPS group was removed using standard chromatographic techniques (Hexanes-Ethyl Acetate on silica gel, or Acetonitrile-water on reverse phase HPLC).\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIOLOGICAL ASSAYS\n\n\nThe compounds exemplified in the present application exhibited activity in one or more of the following assays.\n\n\nGR Ligand Binding Assay Materials:\n\n\nBinding Buffer.

E., et al, European Journal of Cancer. 30A: 484-490 (1994)) HeLa (ATCC) cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco 11835-055) containing 20 mM Hepes, 4 mM L-glu, 10 ug/ml of human insulin (Sigma, 1-0259), 10% FBS and 20 ug/ml of Gentamicin (Gibco# 15710-072) are rinsed twice in PBS. Phenol red-free Trypsin-EDTA is diluted in the same PBS 1 :10. The cell layers are rinsed with IX Trypsin, extra Trypsin is poured out, and the cell layers are incubated at 37\n0\nC for ~ 2 min. The flask is tapped and checked for signs of cell detachment. Once the cells begin to slide off the flask, the complete media is added. The cells are counted at this point, then diluted to the appropriate concentration and split into flasks or dishes for further culturing (Usually 1 :3 to 1 :6 dilution).\n\n\nPreparation of HeLa Cell Lysate\n\n\nWhen the cells are 70 to 85% confluent, they are detached as described above, and collected by centrifuging at 1000 g for 10 minutes at 4\n0\nC. The cell pellet is washed twice with TEGM (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM Sodium Molybdate, pH 7.2). After the final wash, the cells are resuspended in TEGM at a concentration of 107 cells/mL. The cell suspension is snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or ethano I/dry ice bath and transferred to -80\n0\nC freezer on dry ice. Before setting up the binding assay, the frozen \n\n samples are left on ice-water to just thaw (~1 hr). Then the samples are centrifuged at 12,500 g to 20,000 g for 30 min at 4\n0\nC. The supernatant is used to set-up assay right away. If using 50 μL of supernatant, the test compound can be prepared in 50 μL of the TEGM buffer.\n\n\nProcedure for Multiple Compound Screening\n\n\nIx TEGM buffer is prepared, and the isotope-containing assay mixture is prepared in the following order: EtOH (2% final concentration in reaction), 3H-DEX (Amersham Biosciences) and Ix TEGM. [e.g. For 100 samples, 200 μL (100 x 2) of EtOH + 4.25 μL of 1 :10 3H-Dex stock + 2300 μL (100 x 23) Ix TEGM]. The compound is serially diluted, e.g., if starting final cone, is 1 μM, and the compound is in 25 μL of solution, for duplicate samples, 75 μL of 4x1 μM solution is made and 3 μL of 100 μM is added to 72 μL of buffer, and 1 :5 serial dilution.\n\n\n25 μL of 3H-DEX (6 nM) trace and 25 μL compound solution are first mixed together, followed by addition of 50 μL receptor solution. The reaction is gently mixed, spun briefly at about 200 rpm and incubated at 4\n0\nC overnight. 100 μL of 50% HAP slurry is prepared and added to the incubated reaction which is then vortexed and incubated on ice for 5 to 10 minutes. The reaction mixture is vortexed twice more to resuspend HAP while incubating reaction. The samples in 96-well format are then washed in wash buffer using The FilterMate™ Universal Harvester plate washer (Packard). The washing process transfers HAP pellet containing ligand- bound expressed receptor to Unifilter-96 GF/B filter plate (Packard). The HAP pellet on the filter plate is incubated with 50 μL of MICRO SCINT (Packard) scintillint for 30 minutes before being counted on the TopCount micro scintillation counter (Packard). IC50S are calculated using DEX as a reference.\n\n\nTrans- Activation Modulation of Glucocorticoid Receptor Assay\n\n\nThis assay assesses the ability of test compounds to control transcription from the MMTV-LUC reporter gene in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells or HeLa cells, a human breast cancer cell line that naturally expresses the human GR. The assay measures induction of a modified MMTV LTR/promoter linked to the LUC reporter gene.\n\n\nThe routine transient assay consists of plating 7,000-25,000 cells/well of a white, clear-bottom 96-well plate. Alternatively, 384-well plates can be used at a cell concentration of 10,000 /well. The media that the cells are plated in is \"exponential growth medium\" which consists of phenol red-free RPMI1640 containing 10%FBS, 4mM L-glutamine, 2OmM HEPES, lOug/mL human insulin, and 20ug/mL gentamicin. Incubator conditions are 37\n0\nC and 5% Cθ2- The transfection is done in batch mode. The cells are trypsinized and counted to the right cell number in the proper amount of fresh media. It is then gently mixed with the FuGene6/DNA mix and plated \n\n onto the 96 or 384-well plate, all the wells receive 100 uL or 4OuL, respectively, of medium + lipid/DNA complex then incubated 37\n0\nC overnight. The transfection cocktail consists of serum- free OptiMEM, FuGeneβ reagent and DNA. The manufacturer's (Roche Biochemical) protocol for cocktail setup is as follows: The lipid to DNA ratio is approximately 2.5:1 and the incubation time is 20 min at room temperature. Sixteen to 24 hours after transfection, the cells are treated with dexamethasone to a final concentration of 1OnM as well as the compound of interest, such that final DMSO (vehicle) concentration is equal to or less than 1%. Each plate also contains samples that are treated with 1OnM dexamethasone alone, which is used as the 100% activity control. The cells are exposed to the compounds for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the cells are lysed by a Promega cell culture lysis buffer for approximately 30 min and then the lucif erase activity in the extracts is assayed in the 96-well format luminometer. In 384-well format, Steady-Glo (Promega) or Steady- Lite (PerkinElmer) can be used by adding an equal volume of reagent to the media present in each well. Activity induced by 1OnM dexamethasone alone is set at 100% activity. Antagonist activity is calculated by determining the decrease in dexamethasone-induced activity in response to compound treatment relative to samples that were treated with dexamethasone alone. Results are expressed as % inhibition of 1OnM dexamethasone activity or as fold of 1OnM dexamethasone activity. This transactivation assay can be performed in an agonist and antagonist mode to identify these different activities.\n\n\nActivity of test compounds is calculated as the E\nma\nχ relative to the activity obtained with 300 nM dexamethasone. Activity of test compounds is calculated as the E\nma\nχ relative to the activity obtained with 300 nM DEX. The exemplified tissue selective glucocorticoid receptor modulators of the present invention display agonist activity in this assay of greater than 5% and less than 100%, and maximal transactivation activity less then maximal transrepression activity.\n\n\nThe action of compounds is also tested in an antagonist mode (Anti-GRAMMER) in which the cells are treated with medium containing an agonist such as 10 nM DEX and the ability to agents to inhibit the activation by an agonist is measured.\n\n\nTransrepression Assay\n\n\nThis assay assesses the ability of test compounds to control transcription from the TNFα-β-lactamase reporter gene in U937 cells, a human myelomonocytic leukemia cell line that naturally expresses the human GR. The assay measures compound dependent-repression of the TNFa promoter linked to a reporter gene.\n\n\nThe human U937cells that had been stablely trans fected with the TNF-α promoter driving β-lactamase are used for this assay. U937 cells contain an endogenous glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Cells are maintained in RPMI 1640 Growth medium (Gibco Cat#l 1875-093) \n\n containing 25mM HEPES, 10% FBS, 2mM L-Glutamine, ImM Sodium pyruvate, 25μg/ml Gentamicin (Gibco Cat#15710-064), 1 :1000 2-Mercaptoethanol (Gibco Cat#21985-023) and 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Gibco Cat#10131-027). The density of the cells in the flask needs to be about 1X106 - 3X106/ml at the time of harvest. Usually, the cells are split to 1.2-1.4x105 /ml (1 : 10) 3 days prior to the assay. 50,000 cells/well are plated in 96 well black-walled plates the day of assay. Test compounds are added 10 μL/well, and cells are incubated at 37oC for 30-45 min. For assaying compounds, first dilute 1 : 10 in DMSO to make 1 mM, then further dilute 1 : 100 in medium to make 1OX stock prior to adding to the cells. Add 50ng/ml PMA (Sigma, cat# P8139) 10 μL/well to a final concentration 5ng/ml, and 1 μg/ml LPS (Sigma, cat# L4130) 10 μL/well to a final concentration 100ng/ml. Incubate cells at 370C overnight for ~18hr. PMA is stored frozen as 100 μg/ml stock in DMSO. Dilute 1 : 10 in DMSO for a working stock of 10 μg/ml and store at -20C. For assaying, dilute the 10 μg/ml working stock 1 :200 in medium to make a 1OX solution (50 ng/ml). Store frozen LPS at 1 mg/ml in PBS, dilute 1 :1000 in medium to make 1OX (lμg/ml) for the assay. Add 6X loading buffer (CCF2-AM) 20 μL/well, and incubate at room temperature for 70-90 min. Read plates on CytoFluor II Plate Reader according to manufacture suggested protocols. The activity repressed by 10OnM dexamethasone alone is set as 100% activity.\n\n\nMicroarray Analysis\n\n\nThis assay assesses the ability of test compounds to modulate the transcription of endogenously expressed genes in a variety of cell types including but not limited to A549, HeLa or U937 cells. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen Life Tech, Carlsbad CA. A549 cells were grown in phenol red-free DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were grown at 37oC with 5% CO2. Using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen Corp, Valencia CA.), total RNA was extracted and purified from A549 cells treated with different GC compounds for 24 hours, at a fully active dose. These cells express large amount of the GR and are very responsive to GC treatment. All samples were compared against cells treated with vehicle. Expression levels of 23000 genes were measured using oligonucleotide microarrays purchased from Agilent Technologies, Inc. Each comparison was done on a pair of microarrays with reversed fluorophores. Raw image intensity data were processed according to the method described in Patent 6,351,712. The method was used to remove dye bias and to derive a Rosetta probability (p) and fold change value for each gene and each sample pair. Furthermore, for each gene an ANOVA model was constructed across all treatments to derive error estimates. P values for evaluating expression differences were computed using a Bayesian adjusted t-test that was developed by Lόnnstedt and Speed (2002) and extended by Smyth (2003). A gene was declared differentially expressed in any particular comparison if it satisfied two criteria: \n\n 1. The Rosetta p value had to be less than 0.1 and the Rosetta fold change value had to be greater than 1.4 in at least one of the treatments.\n\n\n2. The ANOVA p value had to be less than 0.01 and the fold change greater than 2 in the comparison under consideration.\n\n\nIn Vivo Inflammation Assay\n\n\nIntact adult (6 month old) female Sprague-Dawley rats are used in the oxazolone (OX) contactdermatitis model. Rats were sensitized on the ventral abdomen with OX on Day 0. On Days 7 and 9, a randomly-selected ear was challenged (same ear each time) with OX; the other was treated with vehicle. Daily treatment begun on Day 7 and continued for 7d with test compounds at different doses and 1.3 mpk 6-methlyprednisolone or O.lmpk DEX as positive controls. The thickness of both ears are measured on Days 11 and 14. Necropsy occurred on Day 14. The rat is first weighed, then anesthetized in a CO2 chamber until near death. Approximately 5ml whole blood is obtained by cardiac puncture. The rat is then examined for certain signs of death and completeness. Tissues are dissected in a highly stylized fashion. The the following endpoints were evaluated: a) inhibiting ear inflammation induced by oxazalone, b) raising serum insulin, c) reducing serum ACTH, d) reducing spleen weight, e) reducing skin thickness, f) reducing body weight, g) increasing expression of bone-related genes with potential relationship to negative glucocorticoid effects on bone; e) changes in molecular markers that correlate with skin inflammation, skin thinning, muscle atrophy and glucose metabolism in liver. All blood samples were collected between 1330-1530 hours, ~4-5 hrs after the last compound treatment.\n\n\nPrimary data for this assay are left and right ear thickness. Inter-ear thickness difference (etd) is used for the estimating the level of inflammation and effectiveness of the compounds is determined by their ability to reduce the increase the thickness of the inflamed ear. Back of the rat skin thickness, spleen weight, serum insulin as well as the effects of gcs on the expression of molecular markers in skin inflammation, skin atrophy, muscle atrophy and glucose metabolism in liver are measured. Data are analyzed by anova plus fisher plsd post-hoc test to identify intergroup differences.\n\n\nBioassay Results\n\n\nThe compounds described herein were tested in the Binding, GRAMMER and GITAR assays and demonstrated the activity profiles as shown in Table 2. Compounds shown in Table 2 have potencies in the GRAMMER and GITAR assays (as measured by inflection points, IP) of less than 100O nM. \n\n Table 2\n\n\nTransactivation Transrepression\n\n\nA549 Cells U937 Cells\n\n\nGRAMMER GITAR\n\n\nExample GR\n\n\n# BIND Ki (nM) i InP ( /n lMux) E \n(\nm\n%\na\n)\n x IP (nM) Emax (%)\n\n\n1a 5.2 5.6 83.9 5.6 93.0\n\n\n1 b 4.0 26.4 56.0 24.0 91.7\n\n\n2a 2.2 485.4 46.6 137.0 85.0\n\n\n2b 2.1 316.1 45.5 235.5 94.4\n\n\n3a 0.9 38.8 127.2 37.6 93.3\n\n\n3b 0.9 16.7 130.3 6.0 99.6\n\n\n4 0.9 39.7 80.3 28.2 104.0\n\n\n5a 1.4 78.8 65.5 86.1 84.7\n\n\n5b 0.9 23.6 58.4 29.0 91.8\n\n\n6a 1.1 30.5 62.4 35.7 104.0 \n\n Transactivation Transrepression\n\n\nA549 Cells U937 Cells\n\n\nGRAMMER GITAR\n\n\nExample GR\n\n\n# BIND Ki (nM) i InP ( /n lMux) E \n(\nm\n%\na\n)\n x IP (nM) Emax (%)\n\n\n6b 1.3 124.3 84.7 68.8 98.3\n\n\n7a 0.6 58.8 60.2 87.6 95.3\n\n\n7b 0.9 39.3 55.8 44.7 98.4\n\n\n8 1.2 32.2 56.0 21.4 89.9\n\n\n9 2.1 3.2 80.3 0.6 101.6\n\n\n10a 3.1 23.7 56.6 16.5 89.2\n\n\n10b 1.8 12.4 67.0 4.0 93.9\n\n\n11 19.2 332.3 41.8 240.6 84.6\n\n\n12a 2.6 126.6 47.4 93.1 78.8\n\n\n12b 1.5 33.3 54.2 34.9 93.0 \n\n Transactivation Transrepression\n\n\nA549 Cells U937 Cells\n\n\nGRAMMER GITAR\n\n\nExample GR\n\n\n# BIND Ki (nM) i InP ( /n lMux) E \n(\nm\n%\na\n)\n x IP (nM) Emax (%)\n\n\n13a 2.5 8.8 73.1 3.9 91.0\n\n\n13b 1.9 7.2 57.5 18.0 96.4\n\n\n14a 6.4 478.8 25.0 1133.0 82.2\n\n\n14b 14.1 206.1 32.6 248.7 82.3\n\n\n15a 10.0 68.1 52.7 56.3 87.7\n\n\n15b 8.3 149.2 39.3 98.5 80.6\n\n\n16 3.7 18.4 38.3 21.4 85.4\n\n\n17a 6.4 101.3 26.4 75.3 86.1\n\n\n17b 7.5 77.5 35.6 59.7 83.3\n\n\n18a 1.7 22.3 55.3 7.9 93.1 \n\n Transactivation Transrepression\n\n\nA549 Cells U937 Cells\n\n\nGRAMMER GITAR\n\n\nExample GR\n\n\n# BIND Ki (nM) i InP ( /n lMux) E \n(\nm\n%\na\n)\n x IP (nM) Emax (%)\n\n\n18b 2.3 59.6 56.2 25.7 97.7\n\n\n19a 3.7 41.9 43.7 32.7 91.2\n\n\n19b 9.0 94.8 24.2 73.8 86.7\n\n\n20a 22.6 187.0 23.1 132.7 79.9\n\n\n20b 15.1 807.9 1 1.3 572.9 72.0\n\n\n21a 7.6 151.8 32.4 100.5 85.4\n\n\n21 b 3.7 40.2 64.8 18.7 91.3\n\n\n22a 2.3 28.8 63.2 18.7 90.9\n\n\n22b 5.1 64.2 74.3 14.1 90.6\n\n\n23a 7.7 49.7 39.4 22.8 82.6 \n\n Transactivation Transrepression\n\n\nA549 Cells U937 Cells\n\n\nGRAMMER GITAR\n\n\nExample GR\n\n\n# BIND Ki (nM) i InP ( /n lMux) E \n(\nm\n%\na\n)\n x IP (nM) Emax (%)\n\n\n23b\n\n\n3.3 63.2 47.7 49.6 83.7\n\n\n24a\n\n\n3.1 469.8 7.6 447.4 63.0\n\n\n24b\n\n\n7.5 1000.0 4.5 376.3 57.9\n\n\n25a\n\n\n26.3 291.1 7.9 293.5 61.3\n\n\n25b\n\n\n21.9 401.4 7.6 185.5 69.8\n\n\n26a\n\n\n8.6 143.9 24.8 80.8 82.1\n\n\n26b\n\n\n35.5 653.2 4.3 1509.0 51.8\n\n\n27a\n\n\n13.9 357.1 6.8 597.8 64.2\n\n\n27b\n\n\n13.4 633.6 15.4 334.3 71.9\n\n\n28a\n\n\n8.3 107.3 60.4 54.3 81.2 \n\n Transactivation Transrepression\n\n\nA549 Cells U937 Cells\n\n\nGRAMMER GITAR\n\n\nExample GR\n\n\n# BIND Ki (nM) i InP ( /n lMux) E \n(\nm\n%\na\n)\n x IP (nM) Emax (%)\n\n\n28b\n\n\n5.4 107.3 42.3 90.9 80.2\n\n\n29a\n\n\n11.8 168.0 30.7 176.4 66.6\n\n\n29b\n\n\n8.2 121.1 13.7 102.9 60.9\n\n\nWhile the invention has been described and illustrated with reference to certain particular embodiments thereof, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various changes, modifications and substitutions can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to compounds useful for treating diseases or conditions caused by or exacerbated by histamine-3 receptor activity, pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and methods of treatment using such compounds.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nHistamine is a well-known mediator in hypersensitive reactions (e.g. allergies, hay fever, and asthma) which are commonly treated with antagonists of histamine or \"antihistamines.\" It has also been established that histamine receptors exist in at least two distinct types, referred to as H\n1\n and H\n2\n receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA third histamine receptor (H\n3\n receptor) is believed to play a role in neurotransmission in the central nervous system, where the H\n3\n receptor is thought to be disposed presynaptically on histaminergic nerve endings (\nNature, 302, 832-837 (1983\n)). The existence of the H\n3\n receptor has been confirmed by the development of selective H\n3\n receptor agonists and antagonists (\nNature, 327, 117-123 (1987\n)) and has subsequently been shown to regulate the release of other neurotransmitters in both the central nervous system and peripheral organs, particularly the lungs, cardiovascular system and gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of diseases or conditions may be treated with histamine-3 receptor ligands wherein the H\n3\n ligand may be an antagonist, agonist or partial agonist. Such diseases or conditions include cardiovascular disorders such as acute myocardial infarction; memory processes, dementia and cognition disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, depression, epilepsy, and seizures or convulsions; cancer such as cutaneous carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma and melanoma; allergic rhinitis; respiratory disorders such as asthma; sleep disorders such as narcolepsy; vestibular dysfunction such as Meniere's disease; gastrointestinal disorders, inflammation, migraine, motion sickness, obesity, pain, and septic shock.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn its principle embodiment, the present invention is directed to compounds of formula (I):\n\n \n \n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, amide, or prodrug thereof, wherein\n\n \n \n \nA is selected from carbonyl or a covalent bond;\n \nD is selected from O or S;\n \nL is selected from lower alkylene, fluotoalkylene, or hydroxyalkylene;\n \nP and Q taken together form a covalent bond or are both hydrogen;\n \nR\n1\n and R\n2\n are each independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heterocycle, heterocyclealkyl, hydroxyalkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl; or\n \nR\n1\n and R\n2\n taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, together form a heterocycle;\n \nR\n3\n is selected from hydrogen, alkoxy, alkoxycarbonyl, alkyl, alkylcarbonyl, alkylcarbonyloxy, alkylsulfinyl, alkylsulfonyl, alkylthio, aryl, carboxy, carboxyalkyl, cyano, cyanoalkyl, formyl, halogen, haloalkoxy, haloalkyl, heterocycle, hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, mercapto, nitro, -NR\nA\nR\nB\n, (NR\nA\nR\nB\n)alkyl, (NR\nA\nR\nB\n)carbonyl, or (NR\nA\nR\nB\n)sulfonyl;\n \nR\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n and R\n7\n are each independently selected from hydrogen, alkoxy, alkoxycarbonyl, alkyl, alkylcarbonyl, alkylcarbonyloxy, alkylsulfinyl, alkylsulfonyl, alkylthio, aryl, carboxy, carboxyalkyl, cyano, cyanoalkyl, cycloalkyl, formyl, halogen, haloalkoxy, haloalkyl, heterocycle, hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, mercapto, nitro, -NR\nA\nR\nB\n, (NR\nA\nR\nB\n)alkyl, (NR\nA\nR\nB\n)carbanyl, (NR\nA\nR\nB\n)sulfonyl, -L\n2\nR\n20\n, or -R\n20\nL\n3\nR\n22\n;\n \nL\n2\n is selected from alkylene, alkenylene, O, S, S(O), S(O)\n2\n, C(=O), O=(NOR\n21\n), or N(R\nA\n);\n \nL\n3\n is selected from a covalent bond, alkylene, alkenylene, O, S, C(=O), N(=OR\n21\n), or N(R\nA\n);\n \nR\n20\n is selected from aryl, heterocycle, or cycloalkyl;\n \nR\n21\n is selected from hydrogen or alkyl;\n \nR\n22\n is selected from aryl, heterocycle, or cycloalkyl;\n \nR\nA\n and R\nB\n are each independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, alkylcarbonyl or formyl;\n \nprovided that at least one of R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n, or R\n7\n is aryl, heterocycle, cycloalkyl, -L\n2\nR\n20\n or -R\n10\nL\n3\nR\n22\n.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions and can be useful in methods for treating or preventing disorders related to histamine-3 receptor modulation.

containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem) using a polytron set at 20,500 rpm. Homogenates were centrifuged for 20 minutes at 40,000xg. The supernatant was decanted, and pellets were weighed. The pellet was resuspended by polytron homogenization in 40 mL 50 mM Tris-HCl/5 mM EDTA with protease inhibitors and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 40,000xg. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 6.25 volumes (per gram wet weight of pellet) of 50 mM Tris-HC1/5 mM EDTA with protease inhibitors and aliquots flash frozen in liquid N\n2\n and stored at -70 °C until used in assays. Rat cortical membranes (12 mg wet weight/tube) were incubated with (\n3\nH)-N-α-methylhistamine (∼0.6 nM) with or without H\n3\n receptor antagonists in a total incubation volume of 0.5 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl/5 mM EDTA (pH 7.7). Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO to provide a 20 mM solution, serially diluted and then added to the incubation mixtures prior to initiating the incubation assay by addition of the membranes. Thioperamide (3 µM) was used to determine nonspecific binding. Binding incubations were conducted for 30 minutes at 25 °C and terminated by addition of 2 mL of ice cold 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.7) and filtration through 0.3% polyethylenimine-soaked Unifilter plates (Packard). These filters were washed 4 additional times with 2 mL of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl and dried for 1 hour. Radioactivity was determined using liquid scintillation counting techniques. Results were analyzed by Hill transformation and Ki values were determined using the Cheng-Prusoff equation.\n\n \nTable 1\n \n \n \nExample Number\n \nKi (nM)\n \n \n \n \n1\n \n4.44\n \n \n \n2\n \n46.8\n \n \n \n3\n \n7.45\n \n \n \n4\n \n58.8\n \n \n \n5\n \n49.4\n \n \n \n6\n \n44.9\n \n \n \n7\n \n94.9\n \n \n \n8\n \n1995\n \n \n \n9\n \n136\n \n \n \n10\n \n22.9\n \n \n \n11\n \n19.3\n \n \n \n12\n \n38.4\n \n \n \n13\n \n78.4\n \n \n \n14\n \n25.1\n \n \n \n15\n \n1000\n \n \n \n16\n \n92.2\n \n \n \n17\n \n165\n \n \n \n18\n \n60.5\n \n \n \n19\n \n77.7\n \n \n \n20\n \n180\n \n \n \n21\n \n44.4\n \n \n \n22\n \n69.2\n \n \n \n23\n \n1.97\n \n \n \n24\n \n11.7\n \n \n \n25\n \n14.4\n \n \n \n26\n \n27.2\n \n \n \n27\n \n55.4\n \n \n \n28\n \n9.24\n \n \n \n29\n \n8.46\n \n \n \n30\n \n13.7\n \n \n \n31\n \n24.6\n \n \n \n32\n \n265\n \n \n \n33\n \n32.3\n \n \n \n34\n \n6.89\n \n \n \n35\n \n67.9\n \n \n \n36\n \n52.1\n \n \n \n37\n \n248\n \n \n \n38\n \n26.0\n \n \n \n39\n \n148\n \n \n \n40\n \n32.2\n \n \n \n41\n \n51.5\n \n \n \n42\n \n41.8\n \n \n \n43\n \n14.6\n \n \n \n44\n \n17.2\n \n \n \n45\n \n1.61\n \n \n \n46\n \n18.5\n \n \n \n47\n \n59.8\n \n \n \n48\n \n30.8\n \n \n \n49\n \n14.4\n \n \n \n50\n \n37.1\n \n \n \n51\n \n3.07\n \n \n \n52\n \n162\n \n \n \n53\n \n242\n \n \n \n54\n \n197\n \n \n \n55\n \n575\n \n \n \n56\n \n105\n \n \n \n57\n \n115\n \n \n \n58\n \n133\n \n \n \n59\n \n79.1\n \n \n \n60\n \n1000\n \n \n \n61\n \n143\n \n \n \n62\n \n112\n \n \n \n63\n \n1000\n \n \n \n64\n \n1000\n \n \n \n65\n \n596\n \n \n \n66\n \n90.4\n \n \n \n68\n \n2.2\n \n \n \n69\n \n0.6\n \n \n \n70\n \n2.1\n \n \n \n71\n \n2.0\n \n \n \n72\n \n2.7\n \n \n \n73\n \n2.9\n \n \n \n74\n \n3.5\n \n \n \n75\n \n9.9\n \n \n \n76\n \n4.0\n \n \n \n77\n \n6.0\n \n \n \n78\n \n8.2\n \n \n \n79\n \n3.8\n \n \n \n80\n \n1.4\n \n \n \n81\n \n1.4\n \n \n \n82\n \n1.6\n \n \n \n83\n \n1.1\n \n \n \n84\n \n2.8\n \n \n \n85\n \n42\n \n \n \n86\n \n3.5\n \n \n \n87\n \n16\n \n \n \n88\n \n64\n \n \n \n89\n \n12\n \n \n \n90\n \n21\n \n \n \n91\n \n10\n \n \n \n92\n \n15\n \n \n \n93\n \n6\n \n \n \n94\n \n16\n \n \n \n95\n \n12\n \n \n \n96\n \n223\n \n \n \n97\n \n1.4\n \n \n \n98\n \n0.7\n \n \n \n99\n \n3.6\n \n \n \n100\n \n6\n \n \n \n101\n \n3.4\n \n \n \n102\n \n18\n \n \n \n103\n \n13\n \n \n \n104\n \n41\n \n \n \n105\n \n6\n \n \n \n106\n \n2.3\n \n \n \n107\n \n8\n \n \n \n108\n \n8\n \n \n \n109\n \n10\n \n \n \n110\n \n6\n \n \n \n111\n \n9\n \n \n \n112\n \n3\n \n \n \n113\n \n77\n \n \n \n114\n \n97\n \n \n \n115\n \n33\n \n \n \n116\n \n30\n \n \n \n117\n \n110\n \n \n \n118\n \n42\n \n \n \n119\n \n66\n \n \n \n120\n \n23\n \n \n \n121\n \n51\n \n \n \n122\n \n17\n \n \n \n123\n \n16\n \n \n \n124\n \n34\n \n \n \n125\n \n63\n \n \n \n126\n \n81\n \n \n \n127\n \n120\n \n \n \n128\n \n110\n \n \n \n129\n \n150\n \n \n \n130\n \n60\n \n \n \n131\n \n22\n \n \n \n132\n \n19\n \n \n \n133\n \n6.4\n \n \n \n134\n \n3.2\n \n \n \n135\n \n31\n \n \n \n136\n \n0.4\n \n \n \n137\n \n2.8\n \n \n \n138\n \n1.2\n \n \n \n139\n \n3.1\n \n \n \n140\n \n21\n \n \n \n141\n \n44\n \n \n \n142\n \n29\n \n \n \n148\n \n19\n \n \n \n149\n \n3.3\n \n \n \n150\n \n3.6\n \n \n \n151\n \n53\n \n \n \n152\n \n2.6\n \n \n \n153\n \n32\n \n \n \n154\n \n2\n \n \n \n155\n \n16\n \n \n \n156A\n \n3.7\n \n \n \n156B\n \n9.7\n \n \n \n157\n \n8.4\n \n \n \n158\n \n>1000\n \n \n \n159\n \n14\n \n \n \n160\n \n7.6\n \n \n \n161\n \n1.6\n \n \n \n162\n \n581\n \n \n \n163\n \n3.7\n \n \n \n164\n \n24\n \n \n \n165\n \n16.8\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown by the data in Table 1, the compounds of the present invention bind to the histamine-3 receptors and therefore may have utility in the treatment of diseases or conditions ameliorated with histamine-3 receptor ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention are histamine-3 receptor ligands that modulate function of the histamine-3 receptor by antagonizing the activity of the receptor.

These stereoisomers are \"R\" or \"S\" depending on the configuration of substituents around the chiral carbon atom. The terms \"R\" and \"S\" used herein are configurations as defined in \nIUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E, Fundamental Stereochemistry, Pure Appl. Chem., 1976, 45: 13-30\n. The present invention contemplates various stereoisomers and mixtures thereof and are specifically included within the scope of this invention. Stereoisomers include enantiomers and diastereomers, and mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers. Individual stereoisomers of compounds of the present invention may be prepared synthetically from commercially available starting materials which contain asymmetric or chiral centers or by preparation of racemic mixtures followed by resolution well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These methods of resolution are exemplified by (1) attachment of a mixture of enantiomers to a chiral auxiliary, separation of the resulting mixture of diastereomers by recrystallization or chromatography and liberation of the optically pure product from the auxiliary or (2) direct separation of the mixture of optical enantiomers on chiral chromatographic columns.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,\" as used herein, means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of one skilled in the art of formulations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise compounds of the present invention formulated together with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated for oral administration in solid or liquid form, for parenteral injection or for rectal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther included within the scope of the present invention are pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more of the compounds of formula I-VII prepared and formulated in combination with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable compositions. The pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated for oral administration in solid or liquid form, for parenteral injection or for rectal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other mammals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments or drops), bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term \"parenterally,\" as used herein, refers to modes of administration which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous, intraarticular injection and infusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of this invention for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, and the such as), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservative agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms may be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the such as. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride and the such as. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents, as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf desired, and for more effective distribution, the compounds of the present invention can be incorporated into slow-release or targeted-delivery systems such as polymer matrices, liposomes, and microspheres. They may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter or by incorporation of sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions, which may be dissolved in sterile water or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound can be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose, or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of such composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInjectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsulated matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInjectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic, parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and salicylic acid; b) binders such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia; c) humectants such as glycerol; d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin; f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; g) wetting agents such as cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay; and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the such as.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs.
