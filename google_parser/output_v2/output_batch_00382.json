No. 61/025,099 filed on Jan. 31, 2008 and U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/051,751 filed on May 9, 2008, all of the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n1. Filed of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a pharmaceutical, more particularly, to a multi-cyclic cinnamide derivative effective for treatment of a neurodegenerative disease caused by amyloid-β (hereinafter referred to as Aβ) such as Alzheimer's disease or Down's syndrome and a medicine, in particular, a medicine for prevention or treatment of a disease caused by Aβ comprising the derivative as an active ingredient.\n\n\n2. Description of Related Art\n\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a disease characterized by degeneration and loss of neurons as well as formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary degeneration. Currently, Alzheimer's disease is treated only with symptomatic treatment using a symptom improving agent typified by an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and a fundamental remedy to inhibit progression of the disease has not yet been developed. It is necessary to develop a method for controlling the cause of the onset of pathology in order to create a fundamental remedy for Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nIt is assumed that Aβ-proteins as metabolites of amyloid precursor proteins (hereinafter referred to as APP) are highly involved in degeneration and loss of neurons and onset of symptoms of dementia (see Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2, for example). Main molecular species of Aβ-protein are Aβ40 consisting of 40 amino acids and Aβ42 with two amino acids added at the C-terminal. The Aβ40 and Aβ42 are known to have high aggregability (see Non-Patent Document 3, for example) and to be main components of senile plaques (see Non-Patent Documents 3, 4 and 5, for example). Further, it is known that the Aβ40 and Aβ42 are increased by mutation in APP and presenilin genes which is observed in familial Alzheimer's disease (see Non-Patent Documents 6, 7 and 8, for example). Accordingly, a compound that reduces production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 is expected as a progression inhibitor or prophylactic agent for Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\nAβ is produced by cleaving APP by β-secretase and subsequently by γ-secretase. For this reason, attempts have been made to create γ-secretase and β-secretase inhibitors in order to reduce Aβ production. Many of these secretase inhibitors already known are, for example, peptides and peptide mimetics such as L-685,458 (see Non-Patent Document 9, for example), LY-411,575 (see Non-Patent Documents 10, 11 and 12, for example) and LY-450,139 (see Non-Patent Documents 13, 14 and 15). Nonpeptidic compounds are, for example, MRK-560 (see Non-Patent Documents 16 and 17) and compounds having a plurality of aromatic rings as disclosed in Patent Document 1. However, the compound represented by the formula (VI) as disclosed in page 17 of the specification differs from the compound of the present invention in that the compound is limited to a compound having a 2-aminothiazolyl group as a main structure.\n\n \n \n[Non-Patent Document 1] Klein W L, and seven others, Alzheimer's disease-affected brain: Presence of oligomeric Aβ ligands (ADDLs) suggests a molecular basis for reversible memory loss, Proceeding of the National Academy of Science USA, Sep. 2, 2003;

However, a nonpeptidic compound having high efficacy which inhibits production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 has not yet been known. Accordingly, there is a need for a novel low-molecular-weight compound that inhibits production of Aβ40 and Aβ42.\n\n\nAs a result of extensive studies, the present inventors have found a nonpeptidic multi-cyclic compound that inhibits production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 from APP and thus found a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for a disease caused by Aβ which is typified by Alzheimer's disease. This finding has led to the accomplishment of the present invention.\n\n\nSpecifically, the present invention relates to the following 1) to 19):\n\n \n \n1) A compound represented by the formula

Specifically, the embryos were aseptically removed from pregnant rats under ether anesthesia. The brain was isolated from the embryo and immersed in an ice-cold L-15 medium (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #11415-064, Carlsbad, Calif., USA, or SIGMA L1518, for example). The cerebral cortex was collected from the isolated brain under a stereoscopic microscope. The cerebral cortex fragments collected were enzymatically treated in an enzyme solution containing 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #15050-065, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) and 0.01% DNase (Sigma D5025, St. Louis, Mo., USA) at 37° C. for 30 minutes to disperse the cells. Here, the enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding inactivated horse serum to the solution. The enzymatically treated solution was centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for five minutes to remove the supernatant. 5 to 10 ml of a medium was added to the resulting cell mass. Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #21103-049, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) supplemented with 2% B27 supplement (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #17504-044, Carlsbad, Calif., USA), 25 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME, WAKO Cat #139-06861, Osaka, Japan), 0.5 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #25030-081, Carlsbad, Calif., USA), and Antibiotics-Antimycotics (Invitrogen Corp. Cat #15240-062, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) was used as the medium (Neurobasal/B27/2-ME). However, the above Neurobasal medium not supplemented with 2-ME (Neurobasal/B27) was used for the assay. The cells were redispersed by mild pipetting of the cell mass to which the medium was added. The cell dispersion was filtered through a 40-μm nylon mesh (Cell Strainer, Cat #35-2340, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, N.J., USA) to remove the remaining cell mass, and thus a neuronal cell suspension was obtained. The neuronal cell suspension was diluted with the medium and then plated in a volume of 100 μl/well at an initial cell density of 5×10\n5 \ncells/cm\n2 \nin a 96-well polystyrene culture plate pre-coated with poly-L or D-lysine (Falcon Cat #35-3075, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, N.J., USA coated with poly-L-lysine using the method shown below, or BIOCOAT™ cell environments Poly-D-lysine cell ware 96-well plate, Cat #35-6461, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, N.J., USA). Poly-L-lysine coating was carried out as follows. 100 μg/ml of a poly-L-lysine (SIGMA P2636, St. Louis, Mo., USA) solution was aseptically prepared with a 0.15 M borate buffer (pH 8.5). 100 μl/well of the solution was added to the 96-well polystyrene culture plate and incubated at room temperature for one or more hours or at 4° C. overnight or longer. The coated 96-well polystyrene culture plate was washed with sterile water four or more times, and then dried or rinsed with, for example, sterile PBS or medium, and used for cell plating. The plated cells were cultured in the culture plate at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2\n-95% air for one day. Then, the total amount of the medium was replaced with a fresh Neurobasal™/B27/2-ME medium, and then the cells were cultured for further three days.\n\n\nAddition of Compounds\n\n\nThe drug was added to the culture plate on Day 4 of culture as follows. The total amount of the medium was removed from the wells, and 180 μl/well of Neurobasal medium not containing 2-ME and containing 2% B-27 (Neurobasal/B27) was added thereto. A solution of the test compound in dimethyl sulfoxide (hereinafter abbreviated as DMSO) was diluted with Neurobasal/B27 at 10-fold of the final concentration. 20 μl/well of the dilution was added to and sufficiently mixed with the medium. The final DMSO concentration was 1% or less. Only DMSO was added to the control group.\n\n\nSampling\n\n\nThe cells were cultured for three days after addition of the compound, and the total amount of the medium was collected. The resulting medium was used as an ELISA sample. The sample was not diluted for ELISA measurement of Aβx-42 and diluted to 5-fold with a diluent supplied with an ELISA kit for ELISA measurement of Aβx-40.\n\n\nEvaluation of Cell Survival\n\n\nCell survival was evaluated by an MTT assay according to the following procedure. After collecting the medium, 100 μl/well of a pre-warmed medium was added to the wells. Further, 8 μl/well of a solution of 8 mg/ml of MTT (SIGMA M2128, St. Louis, Mo., USA) in D-PBS(−) (Dulbecco's phosphate buffered Saline, SIGMA D8537, St. Louis, Mo., USA) was added to the wells. The 96-well polystyrene culture plate was incubated in an incubator at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2\n-95% air for 20 minutes. 100 μl/well of an MTT lysis buffer was added thereto, and MTT formazan crystals were sufficiently dissolved in the buffer in the incubator at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2\n-95% air. Then, the absorbance at 550 nm in each well was measured. The MTT lysis buffer was prepared as follows. 100 g of SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate (sodium lauryl sulfate), WAKO 191-07145, Osaka, Japan) was dissolved in a mixed solution of 250 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (WAKO 045-02916, Osaka, Japan) with 250 mL of distilled water. 350 μl each of concentrated hydrochloric acid and concentrated acetic acid were further added to the solution to allow the solution to have a final pH of about 4.7.\n\n\nUpon measurement, wells having no cells plated and containing only the medium and MTT solution were set as background (bkg). The measured values were respectively applied to the following formula including subtracting bkg values from them. Thus, the proportion against the control group (group not treated with the drug, CTRL) (% of CTRL) was calculated to compare and evaluate cell survival activities.\n\n\n% of CTRL=((\nA\n550_sample−\nA\n550_bkg)/(\nA\n550_CTRL−bkg))×100\n\n \n \n(A550_sample: absorbance at 550 nm of sample well,\n \nA550_bkg: absorbance at 550 nm of background well,\n \nA550_CTRL: absorbance at 550 nm of control group well)\n\n\nAβ ELISA\n\n \n\n\nFor Aβ ELISA, Human/Rat β Amyloid (42) ELISA Kit Wako (#290-62601) from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. or Human Amyloid beta (1-42) Assay Kit (#27711) from IBL Co., Ltd. was used. Aβ ELISA was carried out according to the protocols recommended by the manufacturers (methods described in the attached documents). However, the Aβ calibration curve was created using beta-amyloid peptide 1-42, rat (Calbiochem, #171596 [Aβ\n42\n]) The results are shown in Table 1 as percentage to the Aβ concentration in the medium of the control group (% of CTRL).\n\n\n(2) The measurement results are shown in Tables 9, 10, 11 and 12 as percentage to the Aβ concentration in the medium of the control group (% of

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThroughout this application various patent and scientific publications are cited. The disclosures for these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising same and methods of use thereof for the inhibition of certain mammalian genes including TP53BP2, LRDD, CYBA, CASP2, NOX3, HRK, RAC1, RHOA and DUOX1. The compounds and compositions are thus useful in the treatment of subjects suffering from diseases or conditions and or symptoms associated with such diseases or conditions in which gene expression has adverse consequences. In particular embodiments, the invention provides, compositions comprising same and methods of use thereof. The present invention also provides novel structural motifs useful in the preparation of chemically modified siRNA oligonucleotides, compositions comprising same and methods of use thereof.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nsiRNAs and RNA Interference\n\n\n \n \n \nRNA interference (RNAi) is a phenomenon involving double-stranded (ds) RNA-dependent gene specific posttranscriptional silencing. Initial attempts to study this phenomenon and to manipulate mammalian cells experimentally were frustrated by an active, non-specific antiviral defense mechanism which was activated in response to long dsRNA molecules (Gil et al. Apoptosis, 2000. 5:107-114). Later, it was discovered that synthetic duplexes of 21 nucleotide RNAs could mediate gene specific RNAi in mammalian cells, without stimulating the generic antiviral defense mechanisms (see Elbashir et al. Nature 2001, 411:494-498 and Caplen et al. PNAS USA 2001, 98:9742-9747). As a result, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have become powerful tools in attempting to understand gene function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA interference (RNAi) in mammals is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Fire et al, Nature 1998, 391:806) or microRNAs (miRNAs) (Ambros, Nature 2004, 431(7006):350-355; Bartel, Cell 2004, 116(2): 281-97). The corresponding process in plants is commonly referred to as specific post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) or RNA silencing and is also referred to as quelling in fungi.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn siRNA is a double-stranded RNA or modified RNA molecule which down-regulates or silences (prevents) the expression of a gene/mRNA of its endogenous (cellular) counterpart. The mechanism of RNA interference is detailed infra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral studies have revealed that siRNA therapeutics are effective in vivo in both mammals and in humans. Bitko et al., have shown that specific siRNA molecules directed against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) nucleocapsid N gene are effective in treating mice when administered intranasally (Nat. Med. 2005, 11(1):50-55). Recent reviews discussing siRNA therapeutics are available (Barik, et al., J. Mol. Med. 2005, 83:764-773; Dallas and Vlassov, Med. Sci. Monitor 2006, 12(4):RA67-74; Chakraborty, Current Drug Targets 2007, 8(3):469-82; Dykxhoorn et al., Gene Therapy 2006. 13:541-552).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMucke (IDrugs 2007 10(1):37-41) presents a review of current therapeutics, including siRNA to various targets, for the treatment of ocular diseases, for example age related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma.\n\n\n \n \nsiRNA Structures\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe selection and synthesis of siRNA corresponding to known genes has been widely reported; (see for example Ui-Tei et al., J Biomed Biotech. 2006; 2006: 65052; Chalk et al., BBRC. 2004, 319(1): 264-74; Sioud & Leirdal, Met. Mol. Biol.; 2004, 252:457-69; Levenkova et al., Bioinform. 2004, 20(3):430-2; Ui-Tei et al., NAR. 2004, 32(3):936-48).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor examples of the use of, and production of, modified siRNA see, for example, Braasch et al., Biochem. 2003, 42(26):7967-75; Chiu et al., RNA, 2003, 9(9):1034-48; PCT publications WO 2004/015107 (atugen AG) and WO 02/44321 (Tuschl et al). U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,898,031 and 6,107,094, teach chemically modified oligomers. US Patent Publication Nos. 2005/0080246 and 2005/0042647 relate to oligomeric compounds having an alternating motif and dsRNA compounds having chemically modified internucleoside linkages, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther modifications have been disclosed. The inclusion of a 5′-phosphate moiety was shown to enhance activity of siRNAs in \nDrosophila \nembryos (Boutla, et al., Curr. Biol. 2001, 11:1776-1780) and is required for siRNA function in human HeLa cells (Schwarz et al., Mol. Cell, 2002, 10:537-48). Amarzguioui et al., (NAR, 2003, 31(2):589-95) showed that siRNA activity depended on the positioning of the 2′-O-methyl modifications. Holen et al (NAR. 2003, 31(9):2401-07) report that an siRNA having small numbers of 2′-O-methyl modified nucleosides gave good activity compared to wild type but that the activity decreased as the numbers of 2′-O-methyl modified nucleosides was increased. Chiu and Rana (RNA. 2003, 9:1034-48) teach that incorporation of 2′-O-methyl modified nucleosides in the sense or antisense strand (fully modified strands) severely reduced siRNA activity relative to unmodified siRNA. The placement of a 2′-O-methyl group at the 5′-terminus on the antisense strand was reported to severely limit activity whereas placement at the 3′-terminus of the antisense and at both termini of the sense strand was tolerated (Czauderna et al., NAR. 2003, 31(11):2705-16; WO 2004/015107). The molecules of the present invention offer an advantage in that they are non-toxic and are useful in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for treatment of various diseases.\n\n\n \nPro-Apoptotic Genes\n\n\n \n \n \nPro-apoptotic genes are generally defined as genes that play a role in apoptotic cell death. A non-limiting list of pro-apoptotic genes, useful in the present invention is as follows: tumor protein p53 binding protein 2 (TP53BP2); leucine-rich repeats and death domain containing (LRDD); cytochrome b-245, alpha polypeptide (CYBA, p22phox); activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3); caspase 2, apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase (CASP2); NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3); harakiri, BCL2 interacting protein (HRK, BID3); complement component 1, q subcomponent binding protein (C1QBP); BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3); mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8, JNK1); mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14, p38); ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (rho family, small GTP binding protein RAC1); glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B); purinergic receptor P2X, ligand-gated ion channel, 7 (P2RX7); transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 2 (TRPM2); poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG); CD38 molecule (CD38); STEAP family member 4 (STEAP4); bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2); gap junction protein, alpha 1, 43 kDa (connexin 43, GJA1); TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein (TYROBP); connective tissue growth factor (CTGF); secreted phosphoprotein 1 (osteopontin, SPP1); ras homolog gene family, member A (RHOA); and dual oxidase 1 (DUOX1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPCT Patent Application No. PCT/IL2007/001278 (PCT Publication No. WO 2008/050329) and U.S. Ser. No. 11/978,089 to the assignee of the present invention relate to inhibitors of the above-mentioned genes, and are incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nHearing Loss\n\n\nChemical-Induced Ototoxicity\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ototoxic effects of various therapeutic drugs on auditory cells and spiral ganglion neurons are often the factor limiting their therapeutic usefulness. Commonly used ototoxic drugs include the widely used chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin and its analogs, aminoglycoside antibiotics, e.g. gentamycin, quinine and its analogs, salicylate and its analogs, and loop-diuretics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, antibacterial aminoglycosides such as gentamycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, tobramycin, and the like are known to have serious toxic side effects, particularly ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, which reduce their value as therapeutic agents (see Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 6th ed., A. Goodman Gilman et al., eds; Macmillan Publishing Co., Inc., 1980. New York, pp. 1169-71). Thus, ototoxicity is a recognized dose-limiting side-effect of antibiotic administration. Studies have shown that from 4 to 15% of patients receiving one gram per day for greater than one week develop measurable hearing loss, which gradually worsens and can lead to permanent deafness if treatment continues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOtotoxicity is also a serious dose-limiting side-effect for cisplatin, a platinum coordination complex that has proven effective on a variety of human cancers including testicular, ovarian, bladder, and head and neck cancer. Cisplatin (Platinol®) has been shown to damage auditory and vestibular systems. Salicylates, such as aspirin, are the most commonly used therapeutic drugs for their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-pyretic and anti-thrombotic effects. Unfortunately, they too have ototoxic side effects and can lead to tinnitus (“ringing in the ears”) and temporary hearing loss. Moreover, if the drug is used at high doses for a prolonged time, chronic and irreversible hearing impairment can arise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout being bound by theory, cisplatin drugs and other potentially ototoxic drugs induce the ototoxic effects via apoptosis in inner ear tissue, particularly inner ear hair cells (Zhang et al., Neuroscience 2003, 120(1):191-205; Wang et al., 2003, J. Neuroscience, 23(24):8596-8607). Prolonged use of high doses of ototoxic drugs leads to persistent and irreversible hearing impairment. In mammals, auditory hair cells are produced only during embryonic development and do not regenerate if lost during postnatal life. Therefore, a loss of hair cells will result in profound and irreversible deafness.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnfortunately, there are presently no effective therapies to treat the cochlea to reverse deafness. Thus, an effective therapy to prevent cell death of auditory hair cells would be of great therapeutic value. U.S. Ser. No. 11/655,610, assigned to the applicant of the present invention relates to methods for treating hearing impairment in a subject comprising administering to the subject a composition comprising an effective amount of a p53 polynucleotide inhibitor, and optionally an inhibitor of a pro-apoptotic gene.\n\n\n \nPresbycusis\n\n\n \n \n \nAnother type of hearing loss is presbycusis, which is hearing loss that gradually occurs in aging individuals. About 30-35% of adults between the ages of 65 and 75 years and 40-50% of \npeople\n 75 and older experience hearing loss. Accordingly, there exists a need for means to prevent, reduce or treat the incidence and/or severity of inner ear disorders and hearing impairments involving inner ear tissue, particularly inner ear hair cells.\n\n\n \nAcoustic Trauma\n\n\n \n \n \nAcoustic trauma is a type of hearing loss that is caused by prolonged exposure to loud noises. Without wishing to be bound to theory, exposure to loud noise causes the hair cells on the cochlea to become less sensitive. With more severe exposure, injury can proceed from a loss of adjacent supporting cells to complete disruption of the organ of Corti. Death of the sensory cell can lead to progressive Wallerian degeneration and loss of primary auditory nerve fibers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, there exists a need for means to prevent, reduce or treat the incidence and/or severity diseases or disorders resulting from chemical toxicity including inner ear disorders and hearing impairment, renal damage (nephrotoxicity) and neural damage (neurotoxicity).\n\n\n \nAcute Renal Failure\n\n\n \n \n \nAcute renal failure (ARF) is a clinical syndrome characterized by rapid deterioration of renal function that occurs within days. The principal feature of ARF is an abrupt decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), resulting in the retention of nitrogenous wastes (urea, creatinine). Worldwide, severe ARF occurs in about 170-200 persons per million annually. Today, there is no specific treatment for established ARF. Several drugs have been found to ameliorate toxic and ischemic experimental ARF in animal models, as manifested by lower serum creatinine levels, reduced histological damage and faster recovery of renal function. These include anti-oxidants, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, vasoactive substances, growth factors, anti-inflammatory agents and more. However, when these drugs were tested in clinical trials no benefit was shown and their use for treating ARF has not been approved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the majority of hospitalized ARF patients, ARF is caused by acute tubular necrosis (ATN), which results from ischemic and/or nephrotoxic insults. Renal hypoperfusion is caused by hypovolemic, cardiogenic and septic shock, by administration of vasoconstrictive drugs or renovascular injury. Nephrotoxins include exogenous toxins such as contrast media and aminoglycosides as well as endogenous toxin such as myoglobin. Recent studies suggest that apoptosis in renal tissues is prominent in most human cases of ARF. The principal site of apoptotic cell death is the distal nephron. During the initial phase of ischemic injury, loss of integrity of the actin cytoskeleton leads to flattening of the epithelium, with loss of the brush border, loss of focal cell contacts, and subsequent disengagement of the cell from the underlying substratum. It has been suggested that apoptotic tubule cell death may be more predictive of functional changes than necrotic cell death (Komarov et al. 1999, Science. 285(5434):1733-7; Supavekin et al. 2003, Kidney Int. 63(5):1714-24). In conclusion, there are no currently satisfactory modes of therapy for the prevention and/or treatment of acute renal failure, and there is a clear need to develop novel compounds for this purpose.\n\n\n \nRenal Transplant\n\n\nDelayed Graft Function\n\n\n \n \n \nDelayed graft function (DGF) is the most common complication of the immediate postoperative period in renal transplantation and results in poor graft outcome (Moreso et al. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1999. 14(4):930-35). Although the incidence and definition of DGF vary among transplant centers, the consequences are invariable and include prolonged hospital stay, additional invasive procedures, and additional cost to the patient and health-care system.\n\n\n \nAcute Transplant Rejection\n\n\n \n \n \nGraft rejection has been categorized into three subsets depending on the onset of graft destruction. Hyperacute rejection is the term applied to very early graft destruction, usually within the first 48 hours. Acute rejection has an onset of several days to months or even years after transplantation and can involve humoral and/or cellular mechanisms. Chronic rejection relates to chronic alloreactive immune response.\n\n\n \nGlaucoma\n\n\n \n \n \nGlaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world. It affects approximately 66.8 million people worldwide. At least 12,000 Americans are blinded by this disease each year (Kahn and Milton, Am J. Epidemiol. 1980, 111(6):769-76). Glaucoma is characterized by the degeneration of axons in the optic nerve head, primarily due to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). One of the most common forms of glaucoma, known as primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), results from the increased resistance of aqueous humor outflow in the trabecular meshwork (TM), causing IOP elevation and eventual optic nerve damage. Mucke (IDrugs 2007, 10(1):37-41) reviews current therapeutics, including siRNA to various targets for the treatment of ocular diseases, for example, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and glaucoma.\n\n\n \nAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n\n\n \n \n \nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), also known as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or adult respiratory distress syndrome (in contrast with infant respiratory distress syndrome, IRDS) is a serious reaction to various forms of injuries to the lung. This is the most important disorder resulting in increased permeability pulmonary edema.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nARDS is a severe lung disease caused by a variety of direct and indirect insults. It is characterized by inflammation of the lung parenchyma leading to impaired gas exchange with concomitant systemic release of inflammatory mediators which cause inflammation, hypoxemia and frequently result in failure of multiple organs. This condition is life threatening and often lethal, usually requiring mechanical ventilation and admission to an intensive care unit. A less severe form is called acute lung injury (ALI).\n\n\n \nIschemia-Reperfusion Injury Following Organ Transplantation\n\n\n \n \n \nIschemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is one of the leading causes of death in organ allograft recipients. Significant IRI occurs in every organ transplant from a deceased donor and in some from live donors. It contributes to increased acute rejection and impaired long-term allograft function. Lung transplantation, the only definitive therapy for many patients with end stage lung disease, has poor survival rates in all solid allograft recipients.\n\n\n \nAcute Lung Transplant Rejection\n\n\n \n \n \nAcute allograft rejection remains a significant problem in lung transplantation despite advances in immunosuppressive medication. Rejection, and ultimately early morbidity and mortality may result from ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and hypoxic injury.\n\n\n \nSpinal Cord Injury\n\n\n \n \n \nSpinal cord injury, is a disturbance of the spinal cord that results in loss of sensation and/or mobility, also known as myelopathy. The two most common types of spinal cord injury are due to trauma and disease. Traumatic injuries are often due to automobile accidents, falls, gunshots diving accidents, and the like. Diseases that can affect the spinal cord include polio, spina bifida, tumors, and Friedreich's ataxia.\n\n\n \nPressure Sores\n\n\n \n \n \nPressure sores, often known as bedsores or pressure ulcers, are areas of damaged skin and tissue. With unrelieved pressure, tissue ischemia can develop resulting in the accumulation of metabolic waste in the interstitial tissue, resulting in anoxia and cellular death. This pressure-induced ischemia also leads to excessive tissue hypoxia, further promoting bacterial proliferation and tissue destruction.\n\n\n \nAge-Related Macular Degeneration\n\n\n \n \n \nThe most common cause of decreased best-corrected vision in individuals over 65 years of age in the United States is the retinal disorder known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The area of the eye affected by AMD is the macula, a small area in the center of the retina, composed primarily of photoreceptor cells. As AMD progresses, the disease is characterized by loss of sharp, central vision. So-called “dry” AMD accounts for about 85%-90% of AMD patients and involves alterations in eye pigment distribution, loss of photoreceptors and diminished retinal function due to overall atrophy of cells. “Wet” AMD involves proliferation of abnormal choroidal vessels leading to clots or scars in the sub-retinal space. Thus, the onset of “wet” AMD occurs because of the formation of an abnormal choroidal neovascular network (choroidal neovascularization, CNV) beneath the neural retina. The newly formed blood vessels are excessively leaky, leading to accumulation of subretinal fluid and blood leading to loss of visual acuity. Eventually, there is total loss of functional retina in the involved region, as a large disciform scar involving choroids and retina forms. While dry AMD patients may retain vision of decreased quality, wet AMD often results in blindness (Hamdi & Kenney, Frontiers in Bioscience, e305-314, May 2003).\n\n\n \nDiabetic Retinopathy\n\n\n \n \n \nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is recognized as a retinal vascular disorder exhibiting excess capillary permeability, vascular closure, and proliferation of new vessels. DR occurs in two stages: nonproliferative and proliferative. In the nonproliferative stage the disease is characterized by a loss of retinal capillary pericytes, thickening of the basement membrane and development of microaneurysms, dot-blot hemorrhages, and hard exudates. In the proliferative stage the disease is characterized by extensive neovascularization, vessel intrusion into the vitreous, bleeding and fibrosis with subsequent retinal traction, which leads to severe vision impairment. U.S. Pat. No. 6,740,738 and related patents and applications to the assignee of the present invention are directed to methods of inhibiting the RTP801 gene and protein, for treating, inter alia, retinopathy.\n\n\n \nOral Mucositis\n\n\n \n \n \nOral mucositis, also referred to as a stomatitis, is a common and debilitating side effect of chemotherapy and radiotherapy regimens, which manifests itself as erythema and painful ulcerative lesions of the mouth and throat. Routine activities such as eating, drinking, swallowing, and talking may be difficult or impossible for subjects with severe oral mucositis. Palliative therapy includes administration of analgesics and topical rinses.\n\n\n \nDry-Eye Syndrome\n\n\n \n \n \nDry eye syndrome is a common problem usually resulting from a decrease in the production of tear film that lubricates the eyes. Most patients with dry eye experience discomfort, and no vision loss; although in severe cases, the cornea may become damaged or infected. Wetting drops (artificial tears) may be used for treatment while lubricating ointments may help more severe cases.\n\n\n \nIschemic Ocular Conditions\n\n\n \n \n \nIschemic optic neuropathy (ION) includes a variety of disorders that produce ischemia to the optic nerve. By definition, ION is termed anterior if disc edema is present acutely, suggesting infarction of the portion of the optic nerve closest to the globe. ION also may be posterior, lying several centimeters behind the globe. Ischemic optic neuropathy usually occurs only in people older than 60 years of age. Most cases are nonarteritic and attributed to the effects of atherosclerosis, diabetes, or hypertension on optic nerve perfusion. Temporal arteritis causes about 5% of cases (arteritic ION).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSymptoms and signs are sudden, partial or complete vision loss, accompanied by swelling of the optic nerve head and often hemorrhage. Visual field defects may manifest as loss of half the visual field with a horizontal demarcation or as central or centrocecal (surrounding the natural blind spot) scotomata. Decreased vision is soon followed by pallor of the optic disk.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore effective therapies to treat the above mentioned diseases and disorders would be of great therapeutic value.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel TP53BP2, LRDD, CYBA, CASP2, NOX3, HRK, RAC1, RHOA and DUOX1 siRNA, and novel chemically and or structurally modified siRNA compounds for the inhibition of gene expression in general and of mammalian genes TP53BP2, LRDD, CYBA, ATF3, CASP2, NOX3, HRK, CIQBP, BNIP3, MAPK8, MAPK14, RAC1, GSK3B, P2RX7, TRPM2, PARG, CD38, STEAP4, BMP2, CX43, TYROBP, CTGF, SPP1, RHOA, and DUOX1, in particular.

The corresponding polypeptides are set forth in SEQ ID NOS:49-96. The genes listed in Table A, supra, are described in more detail as follows:\n\n\n \n(1) Tumor Protein p53 Binding Protein, 2 (TP53BP2):\n\n\n \n \n \nGene aliases: BBP; 53BP2; ASPP2; p53BP2; PPP1R13A, AI746547, X98550\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis gene encodes a member of the ASPP (apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53) family of p53 interacting proteins. The corresponding protein contains four ankyrin repeats and an SH3 domain involved in protein-protein interactions. It is localized to the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm, and regulates apoptosis and cell growth through interactions with other regulatory molecules including members of the p53 family. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. The polynucleotide sequences of human TP53BP2 mRNA \n \ntranscriptional variants\n \n 1 and 2 are SEQ ID NOS:1 and 2, respectively, and the corresponding polypeptide sequence are set forth in SEQ ID NOS:49-50, respectively.\n\n\n \n(2) Leucine-Rich Repeats and Death Domain Containing (LRDD)\n\n\n \n \n \nGene aliases: PIDD; MGC16925; DKFZp434D229, 1200011D09Rik, AU042446\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protein encoded by this gene contains a leucine-rich repeat and a death domain (LRDD). This protein has been shown to interact with other death domain proteins, such as Fas (TNFRSF6)-associated via death domain (FADD) and MAP-kinase activating death domain-containing protein (MADD), and thus may function as an adaptor protein in cell death-related signaling processes. The expression of the mouse counterpart of this gene has been found to be positively regulated by the tumor suppressor p53 and to induce cell apoptosis in response to DNA damage, which suggests a role for this gene as an effector of p53-dependent apoptosis. Three alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been reported. The polynucleotide sequence of human LRDD \n \n \ntranscriptional variants\n \n \n 2, 1 and 3 are set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 3-5, respectively, and the corresponding polypeptide sequence are set forth in SEQ ID NOS:51-53, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternational Patent Publication WO 01/18037 discloses the LRDD polynucleotide and polypeptide sequences. International Patent Publication WO 03/087368 teaches compositions and methods for inhibiting genes.\n\n\n \n \n(3) Cytochrome b-245, Alpha Polypeptide (CYBA)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGene aliases: cytochrome b light chain; cytochrome b(558) alpha-subunit; cytochrome b, alpha polypeptide; flavocytochrome b-558 alpha polypeptide; p22-phox.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCytochrome b is comprised of a light chain (alpha) and a heavy chain (beta). This gene encodes the light, alpha subunit which has been proposed as a primary component of the microbicidal oxidase system of phagocytes. Mutations in this gene are associated with autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) characterized by the failure of activated phagocytes to generate superoxide, which is important for the microbicidal activity of these cells. The polynucleotide sequence of human CYBA mRNA is set forth in SEQ ID NO:6, and the corresponding polypeptide sequence is set forth in SEQ ID NO:54. International Patent Publication WO 2005/103297 teaches modulation of p22phox activity.\n\n\n \n(4) Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3)\n\n\n \n \n \nGene aliases: ATF3deltaZip2; ATF3deltaZip2c; ATF3deltaZip3, LRG-21, LRF-1\n\n\n \n \n \n \nATF3 is a member of the mammalian activation transcription factor/cAMP responsive element-binding (CREB) protein family of transcription factors. Multiple transcript variants encoding two different isoforms have been found for this gene. The longer isoform represses rather than activates transcription from promoters with ATF binding elements. The shorter isoform (deltaZip2) lacks the leucine zipper protein-dimerization motif and does not bind to DNA, and it stimulates transcription presumably by sequestering inhibitory co-factors away from the promoter. It is possible that alternative splicing may be physiologically important in the regulation of target genes. The polynucleotide sequences of human ATF3 \n \n \ntranscriptional variants\n \n \n 3, 1 and 2 are set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 7-9, respectively, and the corresponding polypeptide sequences are set forth in SEQ ID NOS:55-57, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUS Patent Publication No. 2003/0125277 teaches antisense to ATF3.

Sequential activation of caspases plays a central role in the execution-phase of cell apoptosis. Caspases exist as inactive proenzymes, which undergo proteolytic processing at conserved aspartic residues to produce two subunits, large and small, that dimerize to form the active enzyme. The proteolytic cleavage of this protein is induced by a variety of apoptotic stimuli. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants that encode different isoforms. The polynucleotide sequences of human CASP2 \n \ntranscriptional variants\n \n 1 and 3 are set forth in SEQ ID NOS:10-11, respectively, and the corresponding polypeptide sequences are set forth in SEQ ID NOS:58-59, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nU.S. Pat.

Each of the first, the second and the third segment may comprise one strand of a double stranded RNA and the first, second and third segments may be joined together by a linker. Further, the oligonucleotide may comprise three double stranded segments joined together by one or more linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, one molecule provided by the present invention is an oligonucleotide comprising consecutive nucleotides which encode three inhibitory RNA molecules; said oligonucleotide may possess a triple stranded structure, such that three double stranded arms are linked together by one or more linker, such as any of the linkers presented hereinabove. This molecule forms a “star”-like structure, and may also be referred to herein as RNAstar.

Further, if two or more of linkers A-C are present, they may be identical or different.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, a triple-armed structure is formed, wherein each arm comprises a sense strand and substantially complementary antisense strand (i.e. Oligo1 antisense base pairs to Oligo1 sense etc.). The triple armed structure may be triple stranded, whereby each arm possesses base pairing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the above triple stranded structure may have a gap instead of a linker in one or more of the strands. Such a molecule with one gap is technically quadruple stranded and not triple stranded; inserting additional gaps or nicks will lead to the molecule having additional strands. Preliminary results obtained by the inventors of the present invention indicate that said gapped molecules are more active in inhibiting certain target genes than the similar but non-gapped molecules. This may also be the case for nicked molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA covalent bond refers to an internucleotide linkage linking one nucleotide monomer to an adjacent nucleotide monomer. A covalent bond includes for example, a phosphodiester bond, a phosphorothioate bond, a P-alkoxy bond, a P-carboxy bond and the like. The normal internucleoside linkage of RNA and DNA is a 3′ to 5′ phosphodiester linkage. In certain preferred embodiments a covalent bond is a phosphodiester bond. Covalent bond encompasses non-phosphorous-containing internucleoside linkages, such as those disclosed in WO 2004/041924 inter alia. Unless otherwise indicated, in preferred embodiments of the structures discussed herein the covalent bond between each consecutive N or N′ is a phosphodiester bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor all of the structures above, in some embodiments the oligonucleotide sequence of (N)x is fully complementary to the oligonucleotide sequence of (N′)y. In other embodiments (N)x and (N′)y are substantially complementary. In certain embodiments (N)x is fully complementary to a target sequence.

JBC 277(26):23800-06.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of the present invention, a “mirror” nucleotide (also referred to as a spiegelmer), is a nucleotide analog with reverse chirality to the naturally occurring or commonly employed nucleotide, i.e., a mirror image of the naturally occurring or commonly employed nucleotide. The mirror nucleotide is a ribonucleotide (L-RNA) or a deoxyribonucleotide (L-DNA) and may further comprise at least one sugar or base modification and/or a backbone modification, such as a phosphorothioate or phosphonate moiety.

Further, the inhibitory nucleic acid molecules of the present invention may comprise one or more gaps and/or one or more nicks and/or one or more mismatches. Without wishing to be bound by theory, gaps, nicks and mismatches have the advantage of partially destabilizing the nucleic acid/siRNA, so that it may be more easily processed by endogenous cellular machinery such as DICER, DROSHA or RISC into its inhibitory components.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of the present invention, a gap in a nucleic acid refers to the absence of one or more internal nucleotides in one strand, while a nick in a nucleic acid refers to the absence of an internucleotide linkage between two adjacent nucleotides in one strand.

The compounds are used as chemically and or structurally modified compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe selection and synthesis of siRNA corresponding to known genes has been widely reported; see for example Ui-Tei et al., J Biomed Biotechnol. 2006; 65052; Chalk et al., BBRC. 2004, 319(1):264-74; Sioud & Leirdal, Met. Mol. Biol. 2004, 252:457-69; Levenkova et al., Bioinform. 2004, 20(3):430-2; Ui-Tei et al., NAR. 2004, 32(3):936-48.

WO 2004/015107 and WO 02/44321 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,898,031 and 6,107,094.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides double-stranded oligonucleotides (e.g. siRNAs), which down-regulate the expression of a desired gene. An siRNA of the invention is a duplex oligoribonucleotide in which the sense strand is derived from the mRNA sequence of the desired gene, and the antisense strand is at least substantially complementary to the sense strand. In general, some deviation from the target mRNA sequence is tolerated without compromising the siRNA activity (see e.g. Czauderna et al., NAR. 2003, 31(11):2705-2716). An siRNA of the invention inhibits gene expression on a post-transcriptional level with or without destroying the mRNA. Without being bound by theory, siRNA may target the mRNA for specific cleavage and degradation and/or may inhibit translation from the targeted message.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments an oligonucleotide pair selected from Tables D (D1-D34) comprises modified siRNA, having one or more of any of the modifications disclosed herein. In various embodiments the siRNA comprises an RNA duplex comprising a first strand and a second strand, whereby the first strand comprises a ribonucleotide sequence at least partially complementary to about 18 to about 40 consecutive nucleotides of a target nucleic acid which is mRNA transcribed from a target gene, and the second strand comprises a ribonucleotide sequence at least partially complementary to the first strand and wherein said first strand and or said second strand comprises a plurality of groups of modified ribonucleotides, optionally having a modification at the 2′-position of the sugar moiety whereby within each strand each group of modified ribonucleotides is flanked on one or both sides by a group of flanking nucleotides, optionally ribonucleotides, whereby each ribonucleotide forming the group of flanking ribonucleotides is selected from an unmodified ribonucleotide or a ribonucleotide having a modification different from the modification of the groups of modified ribonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the group of modified ribonucleotides and/or the group of flanking nucleotides comprises a number of ribonucleotides selected from the group consisting of an integer from 1 to 12. Accordingly, the group thus comprises one nucleotide, two nucleotides, three nucleotides, four nucleotides, five nucleotides, six nucleotides, seven nucleotides, eight nucleotides, nine nucleotides, ten nucleotides, eleven nucleotides or twelve nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe groups of modified nucleotides and flanking nucleotides may be organized in a pattern on one or both of the strands. In some embodiments the antisense and sense strands comprise alternating unmodified and 2′ sugar modified ribonucleotides. In some preferred embodiments the middle ribonucleotide in the antisense strand is an unmodified nucleotide. For example, in a 19-oligomer antisense strand, ribonucleotide at \nposition\n 10 is unmodified; in a 21-oligomer antisense strand, the ribonucleotide at \nposition\n 11 is unmodified; and in a 23-oligomer antisense strand, ribonucleotide at \nposition\n 12 is unmodified. The modifications or pattern of modification, if any, of the siRNA must be planned to allow for this. In an even-numbered oligomer, e.g. a 22 mer, the middle nucleotide may be at \n \nposition\n \n 11 or 12.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPossible modifications on the 2′ moiety of the sugar residue include amino, fluoro, methoxy alkoxy, alkyl, amino, fluoro, chloro, bromo, CN, CF, imidazole, carboxylate, thioate, C\n1 \nto C\n10 \nlower alkyl, substituted lower alkyl, alkaryl or aralkyl, OCF\n3\n, OCN, O-, S-, or N-alkyl; O-, S, or N-alkenyl; SOCH\n3\n; SO\n2\nCH\n3\n; ONO\n2\n; NO\n2\n, N\n3\n; heterozycloalkyl; heterozycloalkaryl; amino alkylamino; polyalkylamino or substituted silyl, as, among others, described in \nEuropean patents EP\n 0 586 520 B1 or \nEP\n 0 618 925 B1. One or more deoxyribonucleotides are also tolerated in the compounds of the present invention. As used herein, in the description of any strategy for the design of molecules, RNAi or any embodiment of RNAi disclosed herein, the term “end modification” means a chemical entity added to the \nterminal\n 5′ or 3′ nucleotide of the sense and/or antisense strand. Examples for such end modifications include, but are not limited to, 3′ or 5′ phosphate, inverted abasic, abasic, amino, fluoro, chloro, bromo, CN, CF\n3\n, methoxy, imidazolyl, carboxylate, phosphothioate, C\n1 \nto C\n22 \nand lower alkyl, lipids, sugars and polyaminoacids (i.e. peptides), substituted lower alkyl, alkaryl or aralkyl, OCF\n3\n, OCN, O-, S-, or N-alkyl; O-, S-, or N-alkenyl; SOCH\n3\n; SO\n2\nCH\n3\n; ONO\n2\n; NO\n2\n, N\n3\n; heterocycloalkyl; heterocycloalkaryl; aminoalkylamino; polyalkylamino or substituted silyl, as, among others, described in \nEuropean patents EP\n 0 586 520 B1 or \nEP\n 0 618 925 B1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the siRNA is blunt ended, i.e. Z and Z′ are absent, on one or both ends. More specifically, the siRNA may be blunt ended on the end defined by the 5′-terminus of the first strand and the 3′-terminus of the second strand, and/or the end defined by the 3′-terminus of the first strand and the 5′-terminus of the second strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments at least one of the two strands may have an overhang of at least one nucleotide at the 5′-terminus; the overhang may consist of at least one deoxyribonucleotide. At least one of the strands may also optionally have an overhang of at least one nucleotide at the 3′-terminus. The overhang may consist of from about 1 to about 5 nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe length of RNA duplex is from about 18 to about 40 ribonucleotides, preferably 19, 21 or 23 ribonucleotides. Further, the length of each strand may independently have a length selected from the group consisting of about 15 to about 40 bases, preferably 18 to 23 bases and more preferably 19, 21 or 23 ribonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments the complementarity between said first strand and the target nucleic acid may be perfect. In some embodiments, the strands are substantially complementary, i.e. having one, two or up to five mismatches between said first strand and the target mRNA or between the first and the second strands. Substantially complementary refers to complementarity of greater than about 70%, and less than 100% to another sequence. For example in a duplex region consisting of 19 base pairs one mismatch results in 94.7% complementarity, two mismatches results in about 89.5% complementarity, 3 mismatches results in about 84.2% complementarity, 4 mismatches results in about 79% complementarity and 5 mismatches results in about 74% complementarity, rendering the duplex region substantially complementary. Accordingly, substantially identical refers to identity of greater than about 70%, to another sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe first strand and the second strand may be linked by a loop structure, which may be comprised of a non-nucleic acid polymer such as, inter alia, polyethylene glycol. Alternatively, the loop structure may be comprised of a nucleic acid, including modified and non-modified ribonucleotides and modified and non-modified deoxyribonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the 5′-terminus of the first strand of the siRNA may be linked to the 3′-terminus of the second strand, or the 3′-terminus of the first strand may be linked to the 5′-terminus of the second strand, said linkage being via a nucleic acid linker typically having a length between 2-100 nucleobases, preferably about 2 to about 30 nucleobases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments of the compounds of the invention having alternating ribonucleotides modified in at least one of the antisense and the sense strands of the compound, for 19 mer and 23 mer oligomers the ribonucleotides at the 5′ and 3′ termini of the antisense strand are modified in their sugar residues, and the ribonucleotides at the 5′ and 3′ termini of the sense strand are unmodified in their sugar residues. For 21 mer oligomers the ribonucleotides at the 5′ and 3′ termini of the sense strand are modified in their sugar residues, and the ribonucleotides at the 5′ and 3′ termini of the antisense strand are unmodified in their sugar residues, or may have an optional additional modification at the 3′ terminus. As mentioned above, it is preferred that the middle nucleotide of the antisense strand is unmodified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the antisense and the sense strands of the oligonucleotide/siRNA are phosphorylated only at the 3′-terminus and not at the 5′-terminus. According to another preferred embodiment of the invention, the antisense and the sense strands are non-phosphorylated. According to yet another preferred embodiment of the invention, the 5′ most ribonucleotide in the sense strand is modified to abolish any possibility of in \nvivo\n 5′-phosphorylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny siRNA sequence disclosed herein are prepared having any of the modifications/structures disclosed herein. The combination of sequence plus structure is novel and is useful used in the treatment of the conditions disclosed herein.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nWhile it may be possible for the compounds of the present invention to be administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present them as a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising one or more of the compounds of the invention; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This composition may comprise a mixture of two or more different oligonucleotides/siRNAs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound of the invention covalently or non-covalently bound to one or more compounds of the invention in an amount effective to inhibit one or more genes as disclosed above; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compound may be processed intracellularly by endogenous cellular complexes to produce one or more oligoribonucleotides of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and one or more of the compounds of the invention in an amount effective to down-regulate expression in a cell of a target gene, the compound comprising a sequence substantially complementary to the sequence of (N)\nx\n. In certain embodiments, the target gene is a viral, bacterial or mammalian gene. In various embodiments the target gene is a mammalian gene, preferably a human gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the invention provides a method of inhibiting the expression of a target gene, by at least 50% as compared to a control, comprising contacting an mRNA transcript of the target gene with one or more of the compounds of the invention. In some embodiments an active siRNA compound inhibits gene expression at a level of at least 50%, 60% or 70% as compared to control. In certain preferred embodiments inhibition is at a level of at least 75%, 80% or 90% as compared to control. In some embodiments the target gene is a pro-apoptotic gene as disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the oligoribonucleotide is inhibiting one or more of the pro-apoptotic genes of the present invention, whereby the inhibition is selected from the group comprising inhibition of gene function, inhibition of polypeptide and inhibition of mRNA expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the compound inhibits expression of a polypeptide encoded by a target gene whereby the inhibition is selected from the group comprising inhibition of function (which may be examined by an enzymatic assay or a binding assay with a known interactor of the native gene/polypeptide, inter alia), inhibition of protein (which may be examined by Western blotting, ELISA or immuno-precipitation, inter alia) and inhibition of mRNA expression (which may be examined by Northern blotting, quantitative RT-PCR, in-situ hybridisation or microarray hybridisation, inter alia).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn additional embodiments the invention provides a method of treating a subject suffering from a disease accompanied by an elevated level of the pro-apoptotic genes of the present invention, the method comprising administering to the subject a compound of the invention in a therapeutically effective dose thereby treating the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, the invention provides an oligoribonucleotide wherein one strand comprises consecutive nucleotides having, from 5′ to 3′, the sequence set forth in Table B or a homolog thereof wherein in up to two of the ribonucleotides do not base pair with the ribonucleotide in the complementary strand\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, further nucleic acids according to the present invention comprise at least 14 contiguous nucleotides of any one of the polynucleotides oligomers set forth in Table B (Tables B1-B74) and more preferably 14 contiguous nucleotide base pairs at any end of the double-stranded structure comprised of the first strand and second strand as described above.\n\n\n \nDelivery\n\n\n \n \n \nThe siRNA molecules of the present invention may be delivered to the target tissue by direct application of the naked molecules prepared with a carrier or a diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “naked siRNA” refers to siRNA molecules that are free from any delivery vehicle that acts to assist, promote or facilitate entry into the cell, including viral sequences, viral particles, liposome formulations, lipofectin or precipitating agents and the like. For example, siRNA in PBS is “naked siRNA”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, in some embodiments the siRNA molecules of the invention are delivered in liposome or lipofectin formulations and the like and are prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Such methods are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,593,972, 5,589,466, and 5,580,859, which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery systems aimed specifically at the enhanced and improved delivery of siRNA into mammalian cells have been developed, (see, for example, Shen et al FEBS Let. 2003, 539:111-114; Xia et al., Nat. Biotech. 2002, 20:1006-1010; Reich et al., Mol. Vision. 2003, 9: 210-216; Sorensen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 2003. 327: 761-766; Lewis et al., Nat.

Many other such implants, delivery systems, and modules are well known to those skilled in the art. In one specific embodiment of this invention topical and transdermal formulations may be selected.

The dose must be effective to achieve improvement including but not limited to improved survival rate or more rapid recovery, or improvement or elimination of symptoms and other indicators as are selected as appropriate measures by those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the active dose of compound for humans is in the range of from 1 mg/kg to about 20-100 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably about 0.01 mg to about 2-10 mg/kg body weight per day, in a regimen of one dose per day or twice or three or more times per day for a period of 1-4 weeks or longer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are administered by any of the conventional routes of administration. It should be noted that the compound is administered as the compound, per se, or as pharmaceutically acceptable salt and is administered alone or as an active ingredient in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, solvents, diluents, excipients, adjuvants and vehicles. The compounds are administered orally, topically, subcutaneously or parenterally including intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intraperitoneally, and intranasal, inhalation, transtympanic administration as well as intrathecal and infusion techniques.

Such biotin group may preferably be attached to either the most 5′ or the most 3′ nucleotide of the first and/or second strand or to both ends. In a more preferred embodiment the biotin group is coupled to a polypeptide or a protein. It is also within the scope of the present invention that the polypeptide or protein is attached through any of the other aforementioned end modifications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe various end modifications as disclosed herein are preferably located at the ribose moiety of a nucleotide of the nucleic acid according to the present invention. More particularly, the end modification may be attached to or replace any of the OH-groups of the ribose moiety, including but not limited to the 2′OH, 3′OH and 5′OH position, provided that the nucleotide thus modified is a terminal nucleotide. Inverted abasic or abasic are nucleotides, either deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides which do not have a nucleobase moiety. This kind of compound is, inter alia, described in Sternberger, M., et al., (2002). Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev, 12, 131-43. siNA compounds are described in international patent application WO 03/070918.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that, in the context of the present invention, any of the siRNA molecules disclosed herein, or any long double-stranded RNA molecules (typically 25-500 nucleotides in length) which are processed by endogenous cellular complexes (such as DICER—see above) to form the siRNA molecules disclosed herein, or molecules which comprise the siRNA molecules disclosed herein, are incorporated into the molecules of the present invention to form additional novel molecules, and are employed in the treatment of the diseases or disorders described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, it is envisaged that a long oligonucleotide (typically about 80-500 nucleotides in length) comprising one or more stem and loop structures, where stem regions comprise the oligonucleotides of the invention, may be delivered in a carrier, preferably a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and may be processed intracellularly by endogenous cellular complexes (e.g. by DROSHA and DICER as described above) to produce one or more smaller double stranded oligonucleotides (siRNAs) which are oligonucleotides of the invention. This oligonucleotide is termed a tandem shRNA construct. It is envisaged that this long oligonucleotide is a single stranded oligonucleotide comprising one or more stem and loop structures, wherein each stem region comprises a sense and corresponding antisense siRNA sequence. Any molecules, such as, for example, antisense DNA molecules which comprise the inhibitory sequences disclosed herein (with the appropriate nucleic acid modifications) are particularly desirable and may be used in the same capacity as their corresponding RNAs/siRNAs for all uses and methods disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, analogs of polynucleotides can be prepared wherein the structure of the nucleotide is fundamentally altered and that are better suited as therapeutic or experimental reagents. An example of a nucleotide analog is a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) wherein the deoxyribose (or ribose) phosphate backbone in DNA (or RNA comprises a polyamide backbone which is similar to that found in peptides. PNA analogs have been shown to be resistant to degradation by enzymes and to have extended, lives in vivo and in vitro. Further, PNAs have been shown to bind stronger to a complementary DNA sequence than a DNA molecule. This observation is attributed to the lack of charge repulsion between the PNA strand and the DNA strand. Other modified monomers useful in synthesizing the oligonucleotides include moieties having polymer backbones, cyclic backbones, or acyclic backbones.\n\n\n \nMethods of Treatment\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the present invention relates to a method for the treatment of a subject in need of treatment for a disease or disorder associated with the abnormal expression of a target gene the proapoptotic genes of Table A, comprising administering to the subject an amount of an inhibitor which reduces or inhibits expression of these genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments the subject being treated is a warm-blooded animal and, in particular, mammals including human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods of the invention comprise administering to the subject one or more inhibitory compounds which down-regulate expression of the proapoptotic genes of Table A; and in particular siRNA in a therapeutically effective dose so as to thereby treat the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “treatment” refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) a disorder as listed herein. Those in need of treatment include those already experiencing the disease or condition, those prone to having the disease or condition, and those in which the disease or condition is to be prevented. The compounds of the invention are administered before, during or subsequent to the onset of the disease or condition or symptoms associated therewith. In cases where treatment is for the purpose of prevention, then the present invention relates to a method for delaying the onset of or averting the development of the disease or disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to the use of compounds which down-regulate the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes of the invention particularly to novel small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), in the treatment of the following diseases or conditions in which inhibition of the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes is beneficial: hearing loss, acute renal failure (ARF), glaucoma, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other acute lung and respiratory injuries, ischemia-reperfusion injury following lung transplantation, organ transplantation including lung, liver, heart, bone marrow, pancreas, cornea and kidney transplantation which includes DGF; spinal cord injury, pressure sores, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), dry eye syndrome, ocular ischemic conditions including ION and AION; oral mucositis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Other indications include chemical-induced nephrotoxicity and chemical-induced neurotoxicity, for example toxicity induced by cisplatin and cisplatin-like compounds, by aminoglycosides, by loop diuretics, and by hydroquinone and their analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods, molecules and compositions which inhibit the pro-apoptotic genes of the invention are discussed herein at length, and any of said molecules and/or compositions may be beneficially employed in the treatment of a subject suffering from any of said conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides for a process of preparing a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nproviding one or more compounds of the invention; and\n \nadmixing said compound with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides for a process of preparing a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises admixing one or more compounds of the present invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the compound used in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition is admixed with a carrier in a pharmaceutically effective dose. In a particular embodiment the compound of the present invention is conjugated to a steroid or to a lipid or to another suitable molecule e.g. to cholesterol.\n\n\n \nSynthesis of Modified Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be synthesized by any of the methods that are well known in the art for synthesis of ribonucleic (or deoxyribonucleic) oligonucleotides. Such synthesis is, among others, described in Beaucage and Iyer, Tetrahedron 1992; 48:2223-2311; Beaucage and Iyer, Tetrahedron 1993; 49: 6123-6194 and Caruthers, et. al., Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 287-313; the synthesis of thioates is, among others, described in Eckstein, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 367-402, the synthesis of RNA molecules is described in Sproat, in Humana Press 2005 edited by Herdewijn P.; Kap. 2: 17-31 and respective downstream processes are, among others, described in Pingoud et. al., in IRL Press 1989 edited by Oliver R. W. A.; Kap. 7: 183-208.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther synthetic procedures are known in the art e.g. the procedures as described in Usman et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1987, 109:7845; Scaringe et al., NAR, 1990, 18:5433; Wincott et al., NAR 1995, 23:2677-2684; and Wincott et al., Methods Mol. Bio., 1997, 74:59, and these procedures may make use of common nucleic acid protecting and coupling groups, such as dimethoxytrityl at the 5′-end, and phosphoramidites at the 3′-end. The modified (e.g. 2′-O-methylated) nucleotides and unmodified nucleotides are incorporated as desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe oligonucleotides of the present invention can be synthesized separately and joined together post-synthetically, for example, by ligation (Moore et al., Science 1992, 256:9923; International Patent Publication No. WO 93/23569; Shabarova et al., NAR 1991, 19:4247; Bellon et al., Nucleosides & Nucleotides, 1997, 16:951; Bellon et al., Bioconjugate Chem 1997, 8:204), or by hybridization following synthesis and/or deprotection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is noted that a commercially available machine (available, inter alia, from Applied Biosystems) can be used; the oligonucleotides are prepared according to the sequences disclosed herein. Overlapping pairs of chemically synthesized fragments can be ligated using methods well known in the art (e.g., see U.S. Pat. No. 6,121,426). The strands are synthesized separately and then are annealed to each other in the tube. Then, the double-stranded siRNAs are separated from the single-stranded oligonucleotides that were not annealed (e.g. because of the excess of one of them) by HPLC. In relation to the siRNAs or siRNA fragments of the present invention, two or more such sequences can be synthesized and linked together for use in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can also be synthesized via tandem synthesis methodology, as described for example in US Patent Publication No. 2004/0019001 (McSwiggen), wherein both siRNA strands are synthesized as a single contiguous oligonucleotide fragment or strand separated by a cleavable linker which is subsequently cleaved to provide separate siRNA fragments or strands that hybridize and permit purification of the siRNA duplex. The linker is selected from a polynucleotide linker or a non-nucleotide linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides for a pharmaceutical composition comprising two or more siRNA molecules for the treatment of any of the diseases and conditions mentioned herein, whereby said two molecules may be physically mixed together in the pharmaceutical composition in amounts which generate equal or otherwise beneficial activity, or may be covalently or non-covalently bound, or joined together by a nucleic acid linker of a length ranging from 2-100, preferably 2-50 or 2-30 nucleotides. In one embodiment, the siRNA molecules are comprised of a double-stranded nucleic acid structure as described herein, wherein the two siRNA sequences are selected from Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the siRNA molecules may be covalently or non-covalently bound or joined by a linker to form a tandem siRNA compound. Such tandem siRNA compounds comprising two siRNA sequences are typically about 38-150 nucleotides in length, more preferably 38 or 40-60 nucleotides in length, and longer accordingly if more than two siRNA sequences are included in the tandem molecule. A longer tandem compound comprised of two or more longer sequences which encode siRNA produced via internal cellular processing, e.g., long dsRNAs, is also envisaged, as is a tandem molecule encoding two or more shRNAs. Synthetic modified tandem molecule are also considered to be a part of the present invention. A tandem compound comprising two or more siRNAs sequences of the invention is envisaged.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA molecules that target the pro-apoptotic genes of the invention may be the main active component in a pharmaceutical composition, or may be one active component of a pharmaceutical composition containing two or more siRNAs (or molecules which encode or endogenously produce two or more siRNAs, be it a mixture of molecules or one or more tandem molecules which encode two or more siRNAs), said pharmaceutical composition further being comprised of one or more additional siRNA molecule which targets one or more additional gene. Simultaneous inhibition of said additional gene(s) will likely have an additive or synergistic effect for treatment of the diseases disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the pro-apoptotic siRNA disclosed herein or any nucleic acid molecule comprising or encoding such siRNA may optionally be linked or bound (covalently or non-covalently) to antibodies (including aptamer molecules) against cell surface internalizable molecules expressed on the target cells, in order to achieve enhanced targeting for treatment of the diseases disclosed herein. For example, anti-Fas antibody (preferably a neutralizing antibody) may be combined (covalently or non-covalently) with any pro-apoptotic siRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are delivered for example as double stranded compounds, as double stranded hairpin compounds or as tandem compounds. It is also envisaged that a long oligonucleotide (typically 25-500 nucleotides in length) comprising one or more stem and loop structures, where stem regions comprise the sequences of the oligonucleotides of the invention, may be delivered in a carrier, preferably a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and may be processed intracellularly by endogenous cellular complexes (e.g. by DROSHA and DICER as described above) to produce one or more smaller double stranded oligonucleotides (siRNAs) which are oligonucleotides of the invention. This oligonucleotide is termed a tandem shRNA construct. It is envisaged that this long oligonucleotide is a single stranded oligonucleotide comprising one or more stem and loop structures, wherein each stem region comprises a sense and corresponding antisense siRNA sequence of the pro-apoptotic genes of the invention. In particular, it is envisaged that this oligonucleotide comprises sense and antisense siRNA sequences as depicted in Tables B-D (B1-B74; C1-C4, D1-D34) set forth in SEQ ID NOS:97-87,178.\n\n\n \nRNA Interference\n\n\n \n \n \nA number of PCT applications have recently been published that relate to the RNAi phenomenon. These include: PCT publication WO 00/44895; PCT publication WO 00/49035; PCT publication WO 00/63364; PCT publication WO 01/36641; PCT publication WO 01/36646; PCT publication WO 99/32619; PCT publication WO 00/44914; PCT publication WO 01/29058; and PCT publication WO 01/75164.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA interference (RNAi) is based on the ability of dsRNA species to enter a cytoplasmic protein complex, where it is then targeted to the complementary cellular RNA and specifically degrade it. The RNA interference response features an endonuclease complex containing an siRNA, commonly referred to as an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates cleavage of single-stranded RNA having a sequence complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex. Cleavage of the target RNA may take place in the middle of the region complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex (Elbashir et al., Genes Dev., 2001, 15(2):188-200). In more detail, longer dsRNAs are digested into short (17-29 bp) dsRNA fragments (also referred to as short inhibitory RNAs, “siRNAs”) by type III RNAses (DICER, DROSHA, etc.; Bernstein et al., Nature, 2001, 409(6818):363-6; Lee et al., Nature, 2003, 425(6956):415-9). The RISC protein complex recognizes these fragments and complementary mRNA. The whole process is culminated by endonuclease cleavage of target mRNA (McManus & Sharp, Nature Rev Genet, 2002, 3(10):737-47; Paddison & Hannon, Curr Opin Mol. Ther. 2003, 5(3):217-24). (For additional information on these terms and proposed mechanisms, see for example Bernstein et al., RNA 2001, 7(11):1509-21; Nishikura, Cell 2001, 107(4):415-8 and PCT publication WO 01/36646).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral groups have described the development of DNA-based vectors capable of generating siRNA within cells. The method generally involves transcription of short hairpin RNAs that are efficiently processed to form siRNAs within cells (Paddison et al. PNAS USA 2002, 99:1443-1448; Paddison et al. Genes & Dev 2002, 16:948-958; Sui et al. PNAS USA 2002, 8:5515-5520; and Brummelkamp et al. Science 2002, 296:550-553). These reports describe methods of generating siRNAs capable of specifically targeting numerous endogenously and exogenously expressed genes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than of limitation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is, therefore, to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention can be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is illustrated in detail below with reference to examples, but is not to be construed as being limited thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCitation of any document herein is not intended as an admission that such document is pertinent prior art, or considered material to the patentability of any claim of the present application. Any statement as to content or a date of any document is based on the information available to applicant at the time of filing and does not constitute an admission as to the correctness of such a statement.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nWithout further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in the art can, using the preceding description, utilize the present invention to its fullest extent. The following preferred specific embodiments are, therefore, to be construed as merely illustrative, and not limitative of the claimed invention in any way.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStandard molecular biology protocols known in the art not specifically described herein are generally followed essentially as in Sambrook et al., \nMolecular cloning: A laboratory manual\n, Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, New-York (1989, 1992), and in Ausubel et al., \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology\n, John Wiley and Sons, Baltimore, Md. (1988), and as in Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Baltimore, Md. (1989) and as in Perbal, A Practical Guide to Molecular Cloning, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1988), and as in Watson et al., Recombinant DNA, Scientific American Books, New York and in Birren et al (eds) Genome Analysis: A Laboratory Manual Series, Vols. 1-4 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York (1998) and methodology as set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,666,828; 4,683,202; 4,801,531; 5,192,659 and 5,272,057 and incorporated herein by reference. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out generally as in PCR Protocols: A Guide To Methods And Applications, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1990). In situ (In cell) PCR in combination with Flow Cytometry is useful for detection of cells containing specific DNA and mRNA sequences (Testoni et al., Blood 1996, 87:3822.) Methods of performing RT-PCR are also well known in the art.\n\n\n \nCell Culture\n\n\n \n \n \nHeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured as described in Czauderna, et al. (NAR, 2003. 31:670-82). Human keratinocytes were cultured at 37° C. in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% FCS. The mouse cell line, B16V (American Type Culture Collection), was cultured at 37° C. in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% FCS. Culture conditions were as described in (Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol. 1997 May; 19(4):231-9).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn each case, the cells were subject to the experiments as described herein at a density of about 50,000 cells per well and the double-stranded nucleic acid according to the present invention was added at 20 nM, whereby the double-stranded nucleic acid was complexed using 1 μg/ml of a proprietary lipid as described below.\n\n\n \nInduction of Hypoxia-Like Conditions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cells were treated with CoCl\n2 \nfor inducing a hypoxia-like condition as follows: siRNA transfections were carried out in 10-cm plates (30-50% confluency) as described by Czauderna et al., 2003; Kretschmer et al., 2003. Briefly, siRNA were transfected by adding a preformed 10× concentrated complex of GB and lipid in serum-free medium to cells in complete medium. The total transfection volume was 10 ml. The final lipid concentration was 1.0 μg/ml; the final siRNA concentration was 20 nM unless otherwise stated. Induction of the hypoxic responses was carried out by adding CoCl\n2 \n(100 μM) directly to the \ntissue culture medium\n 24 h before lysis.\n\n\n \nPreparation of Cell Extracts and Immuno Blotting\n\n\n \n \n \nThe preparation of cell extracts and immuno blot analysis were carried out essentially as described (Klippel et al. Mol Cell Biol, 1998. 18:5699-711; Klippel, A., et al., Mol Cell Biol, 1996. 16:4117-27).\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nIn Vitro Testing of siRNA Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nAbout 1.5-2×10\n5 \ntested cells (HeLa cells and/or 293T cells for siRNA targeting human genes and NRK52 cells and/or NMUMG cells for siRNA targeting the rat/mouse gene) were seeded per well in 6 wells plate (70-80% confluent).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n24 hour later, cells were transfected with siRNA compounds using the Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) at final concentrations of 5 nM or 20 nM. The cells were incubated at 37° C. in a CO2 incubator for 72 h.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs positive control for transfection PTEN-Cy3 labeled siRNA compounds were used. An additional positive control used was a blunt-ended 19-mer siRNA, i.e. x=y=19 wherein Z and Z′ are both absent. This siRNA was non-phosphorylated and had alternating ribonucleotides modified at the 2′ position of the sugar residue in both the antisense and the sense strands, wherein the moiety at the 2′ position is methoxy (2′-O-methyl) and wherein the ribonucleotides at the 5′ and 3′ termini of the antisense strand are modified in their sugar residues, and the ribonucleotides at the 5′ and 3′ termini of the sense strand are unmodified in their sugar residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs negative control for siRNA activity GFP siRNA compounds were used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt 72 h after transfection cells were harvested and RNA was extracted from cells. Transfection efficiency was tested by fluorescent microscopy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe percent of inhibition of gene expression using specific preferred siRNA structures was determined using qPCR analysis of a target gene in cells expressing the endogenous gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, the siRNAs having specific sequences that were selected for in vitro testing were specific for human and a second species such as rat or rabbit genes. Similar results are obtained using siRNAs having these RNA sequences and modified as described herein. Similar results of reduced expression of specific genes are obtained with other siRNA oligomers, the sequences of which are listed in Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34). The siRNA oligomers of Tables B are set forth in SEQ ID NOS:97-68654 (disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 11/978,089 and PCT Patent Application No. PCT/IL 2007/001278, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTables C1, C2, C3 and C4 below disclose preferred siRNA sequences, all of which siRNAs were found active in the above assay (Tables C1, C3 and C4-19mer siRNA molecules; Table C2-23mer siRNA molecules). In general, the siRNAs having specific sequences that were selected for in vitro testing were specific for both human and the rat/rabbit genes. Similar results are obtained using siRNAs having these RNA sequences and modified as described herein. Similar results of reduced expression of specific genes are obtained with other siRNAs, the sequences of which are listed in Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34).\n\n\n \n

23\n.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nModel Systems of Acute Renal Failure (ARF)\n\n\n \n \n \nARF is a clinical syndrome characterized by rapid deterioration of renal function that occurs within days. Without being bound by theory the acute kidney injury may be the result of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury such as renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in patients undergoing major surgery such as major cardiac surgery. The principal feature of ARF is an abrupt decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), resulting in the retention of nitrogenous wastes (urea, creatinine). Recent studies, support that apoptosis in renal tissues is prominent in most human cases of ARF. The principal site of apoptotic cell death is the distal nephron. During the initial phase of ischemic injury, loss of integrity of the actin cytoskeleton leads to flattening of the epithelium, with loss of the brush border, loss of focal cell contacts, and subsequent disengagement of the cell from the underlying substratum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTesting an active siRNA compound was performed using an animal model for ischemia-reperfusion-induced ARF.\n\n\n \nProtection Against Ischemia-Reperfusion Induced ARF\n\n\n \n \n \nIschemia-reperfusion injury was induced in rats following 45 minutes bilateral kidney arterial clamp and subsequent release of the clamp to allow reperfusion. The rats were sacrificed seven days following the reperfusion. 12 mg/kg of \nCasp2\n \n \n \n—\n4 siRNA compound (Casp2\n—\n4: Sense sequence: GCCAGAAUGUGGAACUCCU, SEQ ID NO:139; Antisense sequence: AGGAGUUCCACAUUCUGGC, SEQ ID NO:140) were injected into the \njugular vein\n 4 hours following the clamp. ARF progression was monitored by measurement of serum creatinine levels before (day 0) and 1 day, 3 days, 5 days and 7 days post surgery. At the end of the experiment, the rats were perfused via an indwelling femoral line with warm PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The left kidneys were surgically removed and stored in 4% paraformaldehyde for subsequent histological analysis. Acute renal failure is frequently defined as an acute increase of the serum creatinine level from baseline. An increase of at least 0.5 mg per dL or 44.2 μmol per L of serum creatinine is considered as an indication for acute renal failure. Serum creatinine was measured at time zero before the surgery and 1 day, 3 days, 5 days and 7 days post ARF surgery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA particularly preferred compound for the treatment and prevention of ARF which was used in this experiment is a \nCASP2\n \n \n \n—\n4 siRNA compound according to an embodiment of structure (IV) wherein (N′)y (sense strand) comprises L-DNA at position 18 (results presented in the table headed “\nGroup\n 2” below) or wherein (N′)y (sense strand) comprises L-DNA at \npositions\n 17 and 18 (results presented in the table headed “\nGroup\n 3” below), and wherein (N)x (antisense strand) comprises alternating modified and unmodified ribonucleotides wherein the modified ribonucleotides comprise a 2′ OMe modification. The results using placebo is presented in the table headed “\nGroup\n 1” below. The siRNA compound may further comprise a DNA nucleotide at \nposition\n 15 and or an L-DNA nucleotide at \nposition\n 2 in (N′)y. As revealed from the results below, the \nCasp2\n \n \n \n—\n4 siRNA compound administered 4 hours following the clamp reduced the elevation in \n \ncreatinine levels\n \n 1 and 3 days following the ischemia-reperfusion injury. Administration of the siRNA compound prior to the clamp is found to be protective as well against ischemia reperfusion.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup 1: Creatinine levels (mg per dL) in serum in animals\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninjected with \nplacebo\n 4 hours post clamp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBody Weight\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBody Weight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nbefore\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\npost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal\n\n\nexperiment\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nexperiment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n(g)\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n7\n\n\n(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n286\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n265\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n294\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n271\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n281\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n3.9\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n252\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n273\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n255\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n264\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n247\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n287\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n269\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMean\n \n\n\n281\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n260\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup 2: Creatinine levels in serum in animals treated with\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASP2_4 siRNA (L-DNA at \nposition\n 18 of the sense\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstrand, 12 mg/kg) injected 4 hours post clamp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBody\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWeight\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWeight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nbefore\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\npost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal\n\n\nexperiment\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nexperiment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n(g)\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n7\n\n\n(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n290\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n276\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n303\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n282\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n298\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n238\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n310\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n296\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n288\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n269\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n293\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n261\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMean\n \n\n\n297\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n270\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup 3: Creatinine levels in serum in animals treated with\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCASP2_4 siRNA (L-DNA at \n \npositions\n \n 17 and 18 of the sense\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstrand, 12 mg/kg) injected 4 hours post clamp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBody\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWeight\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBody Weight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nbefore\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\npost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal\n\n\nexperiment\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nDay\n\n\nexperiment\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n(g)\n\n\n0\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n7\n\n\n(g)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n311\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n288\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n304\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n271\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n303\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n3.5\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n282\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n301\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n280\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n296\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n276\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n294\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n284\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nMean\n \n\n\n281\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n280\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA compounds from Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34) in particular siRNAs directed to specific proapoptotic genes of Table A, in particular to genes TP53BP2, LRDD, CYBA, ATF3, CASP2, HRK, CIQBP, BNIP3, MAPK8, MAPK14, RAC1, GSK3B, P2RX7, TRPM2, PARG, CD38, STEAP4, BMP2, CX43, TYROBP, CTGF, and SPP1) are tested in the above model system and found to be protective against ischemia reperfusion.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nModel Systems of Pressure Sores or Pressure Ulcers\n\n\n \n \n \nPressure sores or pressure ulcers including diabetic ulcers, are areas of damaged skin and tissue that develop when sustained pressure (usually from a bed or wheelchair) cuts off circulation to vulnerable parts of the body, especially the skin on the buttocks, hips and heels. The lack of adequate blood flow leads to ischemic necrosis and ulceration of the affected tissue. Pressure sores occur most often in patients with diminished or absent sensation or who are debilitated, emaciated, paralyzed, or long bedridden. Tissues over the sacrum, ischia, greater trochanters, external malleoli, and heels are especially susceptible; other sites may be involved depending on the patient's situation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTesting the active inhibitors of the invention (such as siRNA compounds) for treating pressure sore, ulcers and similar wounds is performed in the mouse model as described in Reid et al., J. Surg. Res. 116:172-180, 2004.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn additional rabbit model is described by Mustoe et al, JCI, 1991. 87(2):694-703; Aim and Mustoe, Ann P1 Surg, 1991. 24(1):17-23, and is used for testing the siRNA compounds of the invention. siRNA according to Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34). and specifically compounds directed to genes CIQBP, RAC1, GSK3B, P2RX7, TRPM2, PARG, CD38, STEAP4, BMP2, CX43, or TYROBP are tested in animal models where it is shown that these siRNA compounds treat and prevent pressure sores and ulcers.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nModel Systems of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\n\n\n \n \n \nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized mainly by emphysema, which is permanent destruction of peripheral air spaces, distal to terminal bronchioles. Emphysema is also characterized by accumulation of inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils in bronchioles and alveolar structures. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis may occur as part of COPD or independently.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTesting the active inhibitors of the invention (such as siRNA) for treating COPD/emphysema/chronic bronchitis is performed in animal models such as those disclosed as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStarcher and Williams, 1989. Lab. Animals, 23:234-240; Peng, et al., 2004; Am J Respir Crit. Care Med, 169:1245-1251; Jeyaseelan et al., 2004. Infect. Immunol, 72: 7247-56. Additional models are described in PCT patent publication WO 2006/023544 assigned to the assignee of the present application, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA according to Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34), and in particular to siRNA to genes CIQBP, BNIP3, GSK3B, P2RX7, TRPM2, PARG, CD38, STEAP4, BMP2, CX43, TYROBP, CTGF, and DUOX1 are tested in these animal models, which show that these siRNA compounds may treat and/or prevent emphysema, chronic bronchitis and COPD.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nModel Systems of Spinal Cord Injury\n\n\n \n \n \nSpinal cord injury, or myelopathy, is a disturbance of the spinal cord that results in loss of sensation and/or mobility. The two common types of spinal cord injury are due to trauma and disease. Traumatic injury can be due to automobile accidents, falls, gunshot, diving accidents inter alia, and diseases which can affect the spinal cord include polio, spina bifida, tumors and Friedreich's ataxia.\n\n\n \n \nUptake of siRNA Molecules into Neurons Following Injection into Injured Spinal-Cord:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe uptake of Cy3 labeled siRNA (injected into the injured cord) in different types of cells is examined following spinal cord contusion and in uninjured rats. Sagittal cryosections are produced and immunostaining using four different groups of antibodies is performed in order to determine whether uptake has occurred in neurons, astroglia, oligdendroglia and/or macrophages/microglia. Markers for neurons include NeuN, or GAP43; markers for astroglia and potential neural stem cells include GFAP, nestin or vimentin; markers for oligdendroglia include NG2 or APC; markers for macrophages/microglia include ED1 or Iba-1 (Hasegawa et al., 2005. Exp Neurol 193:394-410).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRats are injected with two different doses of Cy3 labeled siRNA (1 μg/μl, 10 μg/μl) and are left for 1 and 3 days before sacrifice. Histological analyses indicate that many long filamentous profiles take up the labeled siRNA as well as other processes and cell bodies. Immunostaining with antibodies to MAP2 identifies uptake of label into dendrites and into cell bodies of neurons including motorneurons. Staining with other antibodies specific to astrocytes or macrophages reveals lower uptake of Cy3 labeled siRNA as compared to neurons. These results indicate that siRNA molecules injected to the injured spinal-cord will reach the cell body and dendrites of neurons including motorneurons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA compounds according to Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34) and in particular siRNA directed to genes LRDD, CYBA, ATF3, CASP2, HRK, CIQBP, BNIP3, MAPK8, MAPK14, RAC1, GSK3B, P2RX7, TRPM2, PARG, CD38, STEAP4, BMP2, CX43, TYROBP, CTGF, and RHOA are tested in this animal model, which show that these siRNA compounds promote functional recovery following spinal cord injury and thus may be used to treat spinal cord injury.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nModel Systems of Glaucoma\n\n\n \n \n \nTesting the active inhibitors of the invention (such as siRNA) for treating or preventing glaucoma is done in the animal model for example as described by Pease et al., J. Glaucoma, 2006, 15(6):512-9 (Manometric calibration and comparison of TonoLab and TonoPen tonometers in rats with experimental glaucoma and in normal mice).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA according to Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34) in particular to genes TP53BP2, LRDD, CYBA, ATF3, CASP2, HRK, BNIP3, MAPK8, MAPK14, RAC1, and RHOA are tested in this animal model which show that these siRNA compounds treat and/or prevent glaucoma.\n\n\n \nExample 6A\n\n\nModel Systems of Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (ION)\n\n\n \n \n \nAn animal model for Ischemic optic neuropathy was established in adults Wistar rats using a protocol of optic nerve crush injury. Seven days prior to the optic nerve crush, the retinal ganglion cells (RGC) were selectively labelled by application of the retrograde tracer FluoroGold (2%, Fluorochrome, Englewood, Colo.) to the superior colliculus. The tracer was transported by retrograde transport along RGC axons resulting in complete and specific labelling of all RGCs within 1 week post injection of the fluorescent tracer. The animals were subjected to the optic \nnerve crush injury\n 7 days post retrograde tracing. The orbital optic nerve was exposed through a supraorbital approach and all axons in the optic nerve were transected by crushing with forceps for 10 seconds, 2 mm from the lamina cribrosa. A single dose of 20 μg/5 μl of PBS of the \nCasp2\n \n \n \n—\n4 siRNA compound was microinjected into the \nvitreous body\n 2 mm anterior to the nerve head, using a glass micropipette at the time of the optic nerve crush (Casp2\n—\n4: Sense sequence: GCCAGAAUGUGGAACUCCU, SEQ ID NO:139; Antisense sequence: AGGAGUUCCACAUUCUGGC, SEQ ID NO:140; sense strand comprises L-DNA at \n \npositions\n \n 17 and 18 and antisense strand comprises alternating modified and unmodified ribonucleotides wherein the modified ribonucleotides comprise a 2′ OMe modification). The survival of RGCs was determined 7 days following the optic nerve crush by counting FluoroGold-labelled RGCs on flat-mounted retinas. The experimental animals were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde at 1 week after the optic nerve crash. Both retinas were dissected out, fixed for an additional 30 min and flat-mounted on a glass slide for ganglion cell layer quantification. The number of fluorescent RGCs was counted in 16 distinct areas in each retina and the percent of survival of the RGCs was determined compared to samples obtained from rats which did not undergo optic nerve crush injury at all or samples obtained from rats which were injected with PBS, control siRNA or GFP siRNA along with the optic nerve crush injury. Microglia cells that may have incorporated FluoroGold after phagocytosis of dying RGCs were distinguished by their characteristic morphology and excluded from quantitative analyses.

J. Heart Lung Transplant, 23:889-93; Huang, et al., 1995. J. Heart Lung Transplant. 14: S49; Matsumura, et al., 1995. Transplantation 59: 1509-1517; Wilkes, et al., 1999. Transplantation 67:890-896; Naka, et al., 1996. Circulation Research, 79: 773-783.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA according to Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34) and in particular to TP53BP2, LRDD, CYBA, CASP2, BNIP3, RAC1, and DUOX1 are tested in these animal models, which show that these siRNA compounds treat and/or prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury following lung transplantation and thus may be used in conjunction with transplant surgery.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nModel Systems of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome\n\n\n \n \n \nTesting the active inhibitors of the invention (such as siRNA) for treating acute respiratory distress syndrome is done in the animal model as described by Chen et al (J Biomed Sci. 2003; 10(6 Pt 1):588-92. siRNA compounds according to Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34) in particular to genes CYBA, HRK, BNIP3, MAPK8, MAPK14, RAC1, GSK3B, P2RX7, TRPM2, PARG, SPP1, and DUOX1 are tested in this animal model which shows that these siRNAs treat and/or prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome and thus may be used to treat this condition.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nModel Systems of Hearing Loss Conditions\n\n\n(i) Distribution of Cy3-PTEN siRNA in the Cochlea Following Local Application to the Round Window of the Ear\n\n\n \n \n \nA solution of 1 μg/100 μl of Cy3-PTEN siRNA (total of 0.3-0.4 μg) PBS is applied to the round window of chinchillas. The Cy3-labelled cells within the treated cochlea are analyzed 24-48 hours post siRNA round window application after sacrifice of the chinchillas. The pattern of labeling within the cochlea is similar following 24 h and 48 h and includes labeling in the basal turn of cochlea, in the middle turn of cochlea and in the apical turn of cochlea. Application of Cy3-PTEN siRNA onto scala tympani reveals labeling mainly in the basal turn of the cochlea and the middle turn of the cochlea. The Cy3 signal persists to up to 15 days after the application of the Cy3-PTEN siRNA. The siRNA compounds of the invention are tested in this animal model which shows that there is significant penetration of these siRNA compounds to the basal, middle and apical turns of the cochlea, and that these compounds may be used in the treatment of hearing loss.\n\n\n \n(ii) Chinchilla Model of Carboplatin-Induced or Cisplatin-Induced Cochlea Hair Cell Death\n\n\n \n \n \nChinchillas are pre-treated by direct administration of specific siRNA in saline to the left ear of each animal. Saline is given to the right ear of each animal as placebo. Two days following the administration of the specific siRNA compounds of the invention, the animals are treated with carboplatin (75 mg/kg ip) or cisplatin (intraperitoneal infusion of 13 mg/kg over 30 minutes). After sacrifice of the chinchillas (two weeks post carboplatin treatment) the % of dead cells of inner hair cells (IHC) and outer hair cells (OHC) is calculated in the left ear (siRNA treated) and in the right ear (saline treated). It is calculated that the % of dead cells of inner hair cells (IHC) and outer hair cells (OHC) is lower in the left ear (siRNA treated) than in the right ear (saline treated).\n\n\n \n(iii) Chinchilla Model of Acoustic-Induced Cochlea Hair Cell Death\n\n\n \n \n \nThe activity of specific siRNA in an acoustic trauma model is studied in chinchilla. The animals are exposed to an octave band of noise centered at 4 kHz for 2.5 h at 105 dB. The left ear of the noise-exposed chinchillas is pre-treated (48 h before the acoustic trauma) with 30 μg of siRNA in ˜10 μL of saline; the right ear is pre-treated with vehicle (saline). The compound action potential (CAP) is a convenient and reliable electrophysiological method for measuring the neural activity transmitted from the cochlea. The CAP is recorded by placing an electrode near the base of the cochlea in order to detect the local field potential that is generated when a sound stimulus, such as click or tone burst, is abruptly turned on. The functional status of each ear is assessed 2.5 weeks after the acoustic trauma. Specifically, the mean threshold of the compound action potential recorded from the round window is determined 2.5 weeks after the acoustic trauma in order to determine if the thresholds in the siRNA-treated ear are lower (better) than the untreated (saline) ear. In addition, the level of inner and outer hair cell loss is determined in the siRNA-treated and the control ear.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA molecules according to Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34) in particular to genes TP53BP2, LRDD, CYBA, ATF3, CASP2, NOX3, HRK, CIQBP, BNIP3, MAPK8, MAPK14, RAC1, GSK3B, P2RX7, TRPM2, PARG, CD38, STEAP4, BMP2, CX43, TYROBP, and CTGF are tested in this animal model which shows that the thresholds in the siRNA-treated ear are lower (better) than in the untreated (saline) ear. In addition, the amount of inner and outer hair cell loss is lower in the siRNA-treated ear than in the control ear.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nAnimal Models of Osteoarthritis (OA)\n\n\n \n \n \nCollagen induced arthritis (CIA): CIA in mice is described in Trentham et al. (1977. J. Exp. Med. 146: 857-868). Adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA):AA is described in Kong et al., (1999. Nature, 402:304-308). A menisectomy model is described in Han et al., (1999. Nagoya J Med Sci 62(3-4):115-26).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of different siRNA inhibitors, such as siRNA to SSP1, on different parameters related to OA such as chondrocyte proliferation, terminal differentiation and development of arthritis, is evaluated using one or more of the above models, in addition to in vitro models known in the art. siRNA compounds directed to specific proapoptotic genes of Table A, in particular to SSP1, are tested in these animal models which show that these siRNAs treat and/or prevent OA and thus may be used to treat this condition.\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nRat Model Systems for Transplantation-Associated Acute Kidney Injury\n\n\n \n \n \nWarm ischemia—In test rats a left nephrectomy is performed, followed by auto transplantation that results in a warm kidney graft preservation period of 45 minutes. Following auto transplantation, a right nephrectomy is performed on the same animal. Chemically modified siRNA to a target is administered intravenously via the femoral vein either before harvesting of the kidney graft (mimicking donor treatment) (“pre”), or after the kidney autotransplantation (mimicking recipient treatment), or both before harvest and after transplantation (combined donor and recipient treatment) (“pre-post”).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCold ischemia—A left nephrectomy is performed on a donor animal, followed by a cold preservation (on ice) of the harvested kidney for a period of 5 hours. At the end of this period, the recipient rat will undergo a bilateral nephrectomy, followed by transplantation of the cold-preserved kidney graft. The total warm ischemia time (including surgical procedure) is about 30 minutes. Chemically modified siRNA is administered intravenously via the femoral vein, either to the donor animal prior to the kidney harvest (“pre”), or to the \nrecipient animal\n 15 minutes (“post 15 min”) or 4 hours (post 4 hrs) post-transplantation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assess the efficacy of siRNA in improvement of post-transplantation renal function, serum creatinine levels are measured on \n \n \ndays\n \n \n 1, 2, and 7 post-transplantation in both warm and cold ischemia models.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nGeneration of Sequences for Active siRNA Compounds to Pro-Apoptotic Genes and Production of the siRNAs\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing proprietary algorithms and the known sequence of any gene, optionally the pro-apoptotic genes disclosed herein, the sequences of many potential siRNAs were generated. In addition to the algorithm, some of the 23-mer oligomer sequences were generated by 5′ and/or 3′ extension of the 19-mer sequences. The sequences that have been generated using this method are fully complementary to the corresponding mRNA sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34) show siRNAs for the following pro-apoptotic genes: tumor protein p53 binding protein, 2 (TP53BP2); leucine-rich repeats and death domain containing (LRDD); cytochrome b-245, alpha polypeptide (CYBA); activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3); caspase 2, apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 2) (CASP2); NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3); harakiri, BCL2 interacting protein (contains only BH3 domain) (HRK); complement component 1, q subcomponent binding protein (C1QBP); BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3 (BNIP3); mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8); mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 (MAPK14); ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (rho family, small GTP binding protein Rac1); glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B); purinergic receptor P2X, ligand-gated ion channel, 7 (P2RX7); transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 2 (TRPM2); poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG); CD38 molecule (CD38); STEAP family member 4 (STEAP4); bone morphogenetic protein 2-BMP2; gap junction protein, alpha 1, 43 kDa (connexin 43) (GJA1); TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein (TYROBP); connective tissue growth factor (CTGF); secreted phosphoprotein 1 (osteopontin, SPP1); ras homolog gene family, member A (RHOA); dual oxidase 1 (DUOX1). For each gene there is a separate list of 19-mer, 21-mer and 23-mer siRNA sequences, which are prioritized based on their score in the proprietary algorithm as the best sequences for targeting human gene expression.\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nModified siRNA\n\n\n \n \n \nCertain structural motifs useful in siRNA compounds have been tested and shown to be active and or stable.

Compounds comprising the sequences set forth in Tables B (B1-B74), Tables C (C1-C4) and Tables D (D1-D34) and the motifs set forth in Structures (I)-(XI) are shown in \nFIG. 23\n, herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, a CASP2 siRNA where x=y=19 was tested with different structural motifs and compared for activity and stability. In the first compound (Casp2-i) the (N)x (antisense) consists of alternating 2′-OMe modified and unmodified ribonucleotides; three consecutive nucleotides at the 3′ terminus of (N′)y (sense strand) are joined by two 2′-5′ phosphodiester bonds and three nucleotides at the 5′ terminus of (N′)y are LNA. In the second compound (Casp2-ii) (N)x consists of unmodified ribonucleotides; three consecutive nucleotides at the 3′ terminus of (N′)y are joined by two 2′-5′ phosphodiester bonds and three consecutive nucleotides at the 5′ terminus of (N′)y are LNA. In the third compound (Casp2-iii), in (N)x two consecutive nucleotides at the 5″ terminus (the terminal and penultimate nucleotides) are 2′-OMe modified ribonucleotides and three consecutive nucleotides at the 3′ terminus of (N′)y are joined by two 2′-5′ phosphodiester bonds and three consecutive nucleotides at the 5′ terminus of (N′)y are LNA. These molecules are shown herein below in Table E and their activity as denoted by a % inhibition in human HeLa cells and IC50 is presented in Table F. The compounds were shown to be active (>50% inhibition) in HeLa cells. The compounds were further tested for serum stability. Structure CASP2-i was stable for 24 hours in human serum. Casp2-ii and Casp2-iii showed stability over 24 hours, with a low level of degradation products identified.
