Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compounds that inhibit serine protease activity, particularly the activity of hepatitis C virus NS3-NS4A protease. As such, they act by interfering with the life cycle of the hepatitis C virus and are also useful as antiviral agents. The invention further relates to compositions for either ex vivo use or for administration to a patient suffering from HCV infection. The invention also relates to methods of treating an HCV infection in a patient by administering a composition of this invention.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nInfection by hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) is a compelling human medical problem. HCV is recognized as the causative agent for most cases of non-A, non-B hepatitis, with an estimated human sero-prevalence of 3% globally [A. Alberti et al., “Natural History of Hepatitis C,” \nJ. Hepatology, \n31., (Suppl. 1), pp. 17-24 (1999)]. Nearly four million individuals may be infected in the United States alone [M. J. Alter et al., “The Epidemiology of Viral Hepatitis in the United States, \nGastroenterol. Clin. North Am., \n23, pp. 437-455 (1994); M. J. Alter “Hepatitis C Virus Infection in the United States,” \nJ. Hepatology, \n31., (Suppl. 1), pp. 88-91 (1999)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon first exposure to HCV only about 20% of infected individuals develop acute clinical hepatitis while others appear to resolve the infection spontaneously. In almost 70% of instances, however, the virus establishes a chronic infection that persists for decades [S. Iwarson, “The Natural Course of Chronic Hepatitis,” \nFEMS Microbiology Reviews, \n14, pp. 201-204 (1994); D. Lavanchy, “Global Surveillance and Control of Hepatitis C,” \nJ. Viral Hepatitis, \n6, pp. 35-47 (1999)]. This usually results in recurrent and progressively worsening liver inflammation, which often leads to more severe disease states such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [M. C. Kew, “Hepatitis C and Hepatocellular Carcinoma”, \nFEMS Microbiology Reviews, \n14, pp. 211-220 (1994); I. Saito et al., “Hepatitis C Virus Infection is Associated with the Development of Hepatocellular Carcinoma,” \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n87, pp. 6547-6549 (1990)]. Unfortunately, there are no broadly effective treatments for the debilitating progression of chronic HCV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HCV genome encodes a polyprotein of 3010-3033 amino acids [Q. L. Choo, et al., “Genetic Organization and Diversity of the Hepatitis C Virus.” \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n88, pp. 2451-2455 (1991); N. Kato et al., “Molecular Cloning of the Human Hepatitis C Virus Genome From Japanese Patients with Non-A, Non-B Hepatitis,”\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n87, pp. 9524-9528 (1990); A. Takamizawa et al., “Structure and Organization of the Hepatitis C Virus Genome Isolated From Human Carriers,” \nJ. Virol., \n65, pp. 1105-1113 (1991)]. The HCV nonstructural (NS) proteins are presumed to provide the essential catalytic machinery for viral replication. The NS proteins are derived by proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein [R. Bartenschlager et al., “Nonstructural Protein 3 of the Hepatitis C Virus Encodes a Serine-Type Proteinase Required for Cleavage at the NS3/4 and NS4/5 Junctions,” \nJ. Virol., \n67, pp. 3835-3844 (1993); A. Grakoui et al., “Characterization of the Hepatitis C Virus-Encoded Serine Proteinase: Determination of Proteinase-Dependent Polyprotein Cleavage Sites,” \nJ. Virol., \n67, pp. 2832-2843 (1993); A. Grakoui et al., “Expression and Identification of Hepatitis C Virus Polyprotein Cleavage Products,” \nJ. Virol., \n67, pp. 1385-1395 (1993); L. Tomei et al., “NS3 is a serine protease required for processing of hepatitis C virus polyprotein”, \nJ. Virol., \n67, pp. 4017-4026 (1993)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HCV NS protein 3 (NS3) contains a serine protease activity that helps process the majority of the viral enzymes, and is thus considered essential for viral replication and infectivity. The HCV NS3 serine protease is essential for viral replication since the substitutions of the catalytic triad resulted in loss of infectivity in chimpanzees [A. A. Kolykhalov et al., “Hepatitis C virus-encoded enzymatic activities and conserved RNA elements in the 3′ nontranslated region are essential for virus replication in vivo”, J. Virol., 74: 2046-2051]. The first 181 amino acids of NS3 (residues 1027-1207 of the viral polyprotein) have been shown to contain the serine protease domain of NS3 that processes all four downstream sites of the HCV polyprotein [C. Lin et al., “Hepatitis C Virus NS3 Serine Proteinase: Trans-Cleavage Requirements and Processing Kinetics”, \nJ. Virol., \n68, pp. 8147-8157 (1994)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HCV NS3 serine protease and its associated cofactor, NS4A, helps process the viral non-structural protein region into individual non-structural proteins, including all of the viral enzymes. This processing appears to be analogous to that carried out by the human immunodeficiency virus aspartyl protease, which is also involved in processing of viral proteins. HIV protease inhibitors, which inhibit viral protein processing are potent antiviral agents in man, indicating that interrupting this stage of the viral life cycle results in therapeutically active agents. Consequently it is an attractive target for drug discovery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral potential HCV protease inhibitors have been described in the prior art [PCT publication Nos. WO 02/18369, WO 02/08244, WO 00/09558, WO 00/09543, WO 99/64442, WO 99/07733, WO 99/07734, WO 99/50230, WO 98/46630, WO 98/17679 and WO 97/43310, U.S. Pat. No. 5,990,276, M. Llinas-Brunet et al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., \n8, pp. 1713-18 (1998); W. Han et al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., \n10, 711-13 (2000); R. Dunsdon et al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., \n10, pp. 1571-79 (2000); M. Llinas-Brunet et al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., \n10, pp. 2267-70 (2000); and S. LaPlante et al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., \n10, pp. 2271-74 (2000)]. It is not known however whether these compounds would have the appropriate profiles to be acceptable drugs.\n\n\n \n \nFurthermore, most, if not all of these inhibitors were discovered using the genotype 1 (1a or 1b) NS3-4A serine protease as the target. However, there are a variety of genotypes of HCV, and a variety of subtypes within each genotype. For example, at present it is known that there are eleven (numbered 1 through 11) main genotypes of HCV, although others have classified the genotypes as 6 main genotypes. Each of these genotypes is further subdivided into subtypes (1a-1c; 2a-2c; 3a-3b; 4a-4-e; 5a; 6a; 7a-7b; 8a-8b; 9a; 10a; and 11a).\n\n\nThe prevalence of the subtypes varies globally as follows:\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1a\n \nFound mostly in North and South America;\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncommon in Australia\n \n \n \n \n \n 1b\n \nFound mostly in Europe and Asia\n \n \n \n \n \n 2a\n \nMost \ncommon genotype\n 2 in Japan and China\n \n \n \n \n \n 2b\n \nMost \ncommon genotype\n 2 in US and Northern\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEurope\n \n \n \n \n \n 2c\n \nMost \ncommon genotype\n 2 in Western and\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSouthern Europe\n \n \n \n \n \n 3a\n \nHighly prevalent in Australia and South\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAsia\n \n \n \n \n \n 4a\n \nHighly prevalent in Egypt\n \n \n \n \n \n 4c\n \nHighly prevalent in Central Africa\n \n \n \n \n \n 5a\n \nHighly prevalent in South Africa\n \n \n \n \n \n 6a\n \nRestricted to Hong Kong, Macau and Vietnam\n \n \n \n \n \n 7a & 7b\n \nCommon in Thailand\n \n \n \n \n \n 8a, 8b & 8c\n \nPrevalent in Vietnam\n \n \n \n \n \n10a and 11a\n \nFound in Indonesia\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe current scientific belief is that HCV genotype or subtype may determine the responsiveness of the patient to therapy. While it has been noted that there is a correlation between the degree of genomic complexity of the HCV and the patients response to interferon therapy the reason for this correlation is unclear. It is generally accepted that \ngenotype\n 2 HCV and genotype 3 HCV virus-infected patients respond to conventional therapy to a different degree than those patient infected with \ngenotype\n 1 HCV. Thus, while a number of HCV protease inhibitors have been designed/discovered against \ngenotype\n 1 HCV protease, it is not clear whether these inhibitors will effectively inhibit the HCV NS3-4A serine proteases from other genotypes, such as for \nexample genotype\n 2 HCV and genotype 3 HCV.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, the current understanding of HCV has not led to any satisfactory anti-HCV agents or treatments. The only established therapy for HCV disease is combination treatment of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. However, interferons have significant side effects [M. A. Wlaker et al., “Hepatitis C Virus: An Overview of Current Approaches and Progress,” \nDDT, \n4, pp. 518-29 (1999); D. Moradpour et al., “Current and Evolving Therapies for Hepatitis C,” \nEur. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol., \n11, pp. 1199-1202 (1999); H. L. A. Janssen et al. “Suicide Associated with Alfa-Interferon Therapy for Chronic Viral Hepatitis,” \nJ. Hepatol., \n21, pp. 241-243 (1994); P. F. Renault et al., “Side Effects of Alpha Interferon,” \nSeminars in Liver Disease, \n9, pp. 273-277. (1989)] and induce long term remission in only a fraction (˜25%) of cases [O. Weiland, “Interferon Therapy in Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection”, \nFEMS Microbiol. Rev., \n14, pp. 279-288 (1994)]. In addition, this combination treatment has roughly 80% sustained viral response (SVR) for patients infected with \ngenotype\n 2 or 3 HCV and 40-50% SVR in \ngenotype\n 1 HCV-infected patients [J. G. McHutchison, et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 339: 1485-1492 (1998); G. L. Davis et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 339: 1493-1499 (1998)]. Moreover, the prospects for effective anti-HCV vaccines remain uncertain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, there is a need for more effective anti-HCV therapies, particularly compounds that inhibit HCV NS3 protease. Such compounds may be useful as antiviral agents, particularly as anti-HCV agents. There is also a need for compounds that inhibit various genotypes of the HCV serine protease.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention addresses these needs by providing a method for inhibiting genotype-2 and genotype-3 HCV with VX-950. While the present invention exemplifies that VX-950 is superior to other protease inhibitors at specifically inhibiting genotype-2 and genotype-3 HCV, it is contemplated that \nother non-genotype\n 1 HCV genotypes also may be beneficially inhibited by VX-950.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to compositions that comprise the VX-950 and the use thereof. Such compositions may be used to pre-treat invasive devices to be inserted into a patient, to treat biological samples, such as blood, prior to administration to a patient, and for direct administration to a patient. In each case the composition will be used to inhibit HCV replication and to lessen the risk of or the severity of HCV infection.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n The alignment of amino acid sequence of eleven \ngenotype\n 2 HCV NS3 serine protease domains\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n.

VX-950 may be prepared in general by methods known to those skilled in the art (see, e.g., WO 02/18369).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound of this invention may contain one or more asymmetric carbon atoms and thus may occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. All such isomeric forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. Each stereogenic carbon may be of the R or S configuration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in certain embodiments, compounds used may be mixtures of the D- and L-isomers at the N-propyl-side chain as depicted in the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nOther agents generated through rational drug design using e.g., VX-950 or the compound of Structure A as a starting compound may be tested for their activity as protease inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the compounds of this invention have the structure and stereochemistry depicted in compounds in VX-950.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of this invention provides a composition comprising VX-950 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. According to a preferred embodiment, VX-950 is present in an amount effective to decrease the viral load in a sample or in a patient, wherein said virus encodes a serine protease necessary for the viral life cycle, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf pharmaceutically acceptable salts of a compound of this invention are utilized in these compositions, those salts are preferably derived from inorganic or organic acids and bases. Included among such acid salts are the following: acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzene sulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphor sulfonate, cyclopentane-propionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenyl-propionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate and undecanoate. Base salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts, such as sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases, such as dicyclohexylamine salts, N-methyl-D-glucamine, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and so forth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chloride, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates, such as dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates, long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides, aralkyl halides, such as benzyl and phenethyl bromides, and others. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are thereby obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds utilized in the compositions and methods of this invention may also be modified by appending appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable carriers that may be used in these compositions include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to a preferred embodiment, the compositions of this invention are formulated for pharmaceutical administration to a mammal, preferably a human being.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. The term “parenteral” as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques. Preferably, the compositions are administered orally or intravenously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable forms of the compositions of this invention may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension. These suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents which are commonly used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage levels of between about 0.01 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably between about 0.5 and about 75 mg/kg body weight per day of the protease inhibitor compounds described herein are useful in a monotherapy for the prevention and treatment of antiviral, particularly anti-HCV mediated disease. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be administered from about 1 to about 5 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. A typical preparation will contain from about 5% to about 95% active compound (w/w). Preferably, such preparations contain from about 20% to about 80% active compound. As recognized by skilled practitioners, dosages of interferon are typically measured in IU (e.g., about 4 million IU to about 12 million IU).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compositions of this invention comprise a combination of VX-950 and one or more additional therapeutic or prophylactic agents, both the compound and the additional agent should be present at dosage levels of between about 10 to 100%, and more preferably between about 10 to 80% of the dosage normally administered in a monotherapy regimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers that are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried cornstarch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents may also be added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These may be prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be administered topically, especially when the target of treatment includes areas or organs readily accessible by topical application, including diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTopical application for the lower intestinal tract may be effected in a rectal suppository formulation (see above) or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical applications, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one or more carriers.

Occasionally, the reactions may not be applicable as described to each compound included within the scope of compounds disclosed herein. The compounds for which this occurs will be readily recognized by those skilled in the art. In all such cases, either the reactions can be successfully performed by conventional modifications known to those skilled in the art, e.g., by appropriate protection of interfering groups, by changing to alternative conventional reagents, by routine modification of reaction conditions, and the like, or other reactions disclosed herein or otherwise conventional will be applicable to the preparation of the corresponding compounds of this invention. In all preparative methods, all starting materials are known or readily preparable from known starting materials.\n\n\nWhile nucleoside analogs are generally employed as antiviral agents as is, nucleotides (nucleoside phosphates) sometimes have to be converted to nucleosides in order to facilitate their transport across cell membranes. An example of a chemically modified nucleotide capable of entering cells is S-1-3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl cytosine (HPMPC, Gilead Sciences). Nucleoside and nucleotide compounds used in this invention that are acids can form salts. Examples include salts with alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, potassium, calcium, or magnesium, or with organic bases or basic quaternary ammonium salts.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention may also involve administering a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase inhibitor.

It is contemplated that any such methods and compositions may be used in combination with the methods and compositions of the present invention. For brevity, the disclosure the disclosures from those publications is referred to be reference to the publication number but it should be noted that the disclosure of the compounds in particular is specifically incorporated herein by reference. Exemplary such publications include U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040058982; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050192212; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050080005; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050062522; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050020503; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040229818; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040229817; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040224900; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040186125; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040171626; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040110747; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040072788; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040067901; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030191067; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030187018; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030186895; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20030181363; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20020147160; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20040082574; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050192212; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050187192; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050187165; U.S. Patent Publication No. 20050049220.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunomodulators, immunostimulants and other agents useful in the combination therapy methods of the present invention can be administered in amounts lower than those conventional in the art. For example, interferon alpha is typically administered to humans for the treatment of HCV infections in an amount of from about 1×10\n6 \nunits/person three times per week to about 10×10\n6 \nunits/person three times per week (Simon et al., Hepatology 25: 445-448 (1997)). In the methods and compositions of the present invention, this dose can be in the range of from about 0. 1×10\n6 \nunits/person three times per week to about 7.5×10\n6 \nunits/person three times per week; more preferably from about 0.5×10\n6 \nunits/person three times per week to about 5×10\n6 \nunits/person three times per week; most preferably from about 1×10\n6 \nunits/person three times per week to about 3×10\n6 \nunits/person three times per week. Due to the enhanced hepatitis C virus antiviral effectiveness of immunomodulators, immunostimulants or other anti-HCV agent in the presence of the HCV serine protease inhibitors of the present invention, reduced amounts of these immunomodulators/immunostimulants can be employed in the treatment methods and compositions contemplated herein. Similarly, due to the enhanced hepatitis C virus antiviral effectiveness of the present HCV serine protease inhibitors in the presence of immunomodulators and immunostimulants, reduced amounts of these HCV serine protease inhibitors can be employed in the methods and compositions contemplated herein. Such reduced amounts can be determined by routine monitoring of hepatitis C virus titers in infected patients undergoing therapy. This can be carried out by, for example, monitoring HCV RNA in patients' serum by slot-blot, dot-blot, or RT-PCR techniques, or by measurement of HCV surface or other antigens. Patients can be similarly monitored during combination therapy employing the HCV serine protease inhibitors disclosed herein and other compounds having anti-HCV activity, for example nucleoside and/or nucleotide antiviral agents, to determine the lowest effective doses of each when used in combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the methods of combination therapy disclosed herein, nucleoside or nucleotide antiviral compounds, or mixtures thereof, can be administered to humans in an amount in the range of from about 0.1 mg/person/day to about 500 mg/person/day; preferably from about 10 mg/person/day to about 300 mg/person/day; more preferably from about 25 mg/person/day to about 200 mg/person/day; even more preferably from about 50 mg/person/day to about 150 mg/person/day; and most preferably in the range of from about 1 mg/person/day to about 50 mg/person/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDoses of compounds can be administered to a patient in a single dose or in proportionate doses. In the latter case, dosage unit compositions can contain such amounts of submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. Multiple doses per day can also increase the total daily dose should this be desired by the person prescribing the drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe regimen for treating a patient suffering from a HCV infection with the compounds and/or compositions of the present invention is selected in accordance with a variety of factors, including the age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the patient, the severity of the infection, the route of administration, pharmacological considerations such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology profiles of the particular compounds employed, and whether a drug delivery system is utilized. Administration of the drug combinations disclosed herein should generally be continued over a period of several weeks to several months or years until virus titers reach acceptable levels, indicating that infection has been controlled or eradicated. Patients undergoing treatment with the drug combinations disclosed herein can be routinely monitored by measuring hepatitis viral RNA in patients' serum by slot-blot, dot-blot, or RT-PCR techniques, or by measurement of hepatitis C viral antigens, such as surface antigens, in serum to determine the effectiveness of therapy. Continuous analysis of the data obtained by these methods permits modification of the treatment regimen during therapy so that optimal amounts of each component in the combination are administered, and so that the duration of treatment can be determined as well. Thus, the treatment regimen/dosing schedule can be rationally modified over the course of therapy so that the lowest amounts of each of the antiviral compounds used in combination which together exhibit satisfactory anti-hepatitis C virus effectiveness are administered, and so that administration of such antiviral compounds in combination is continued only so long as is necessary to successfully treat the infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses the use of the HCV serine protease inhibitors disclosed herein in various combinations with the foregoing and similar types of compounds having anti-HCV activity to treat or prevent HCV infections in patients. For example, one or more HCV serine protease inhibitors can be used in combination with: one or more interferons or interferon derivatives having anti-HCV activity; one or more non-interferon compounds having anti-HCV activity; or one or more interferons or interferon derivatives having anti-HCV activity and one or more non-interferon compounds having anti-HCV activity. When used in combination to treat or prevent HCV infection in a human patient, any of the presently disclosed HCV serine protease inhibitors and foregoing compounds having anti-HCV activity can be present in a pharmaceutically or anti-HCV effective amount. By virtue of their additive or synergistic effects, when used in the combinations described above, each can also be present in a subclinical pharmaceutically effective or anti-HCV effective amount, i.e., an amount that, if used alone, provides reduced pharmaceutical effectiveness in completely inhibiting or reducing the accumulation of HCV virions and/or reducing or ameliorating conditions or symptoms associated with HCV infection or pathogenesis in patients compared to such HCV serine protease inhibitors and compounds having anti-HCV activity when used in pharmaceutically effective amounts. In addition, the present invention encompasses the use of combinations of HCV serine protease inhibitors and compounds having anti-HCV activity as described above to treat or prevent HCV infections, where one or more of these inhibitors or compounds is present in a pharmaceutically effective amount, and the other(s) is (are) present in a subclinical pharmaceutically-effective or anti-HCV effective amount(s) owing to their additive or synergistic effects. As used herein, the term “additive effect” describes the combined effect of two (or more) pharmaceutically active agents that is equal to the sum of the effect of each agent given alone. A synergistic effect is one in which the combined effect of two (or more) pharmaceutically active agents is greater than the sum of the effect of each agent given alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon improvement of a patient's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of this invention may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained when the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level, treatment should cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should also be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the judgment of the treating physician and the severity of the particular disease being treated. The amount of active ingredients will also depend upon the particular described compound and the presence or absence and the nature of the additional anti-viral agent in the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating a patient infected with a virus characterized by a virally encoded serine protease that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus by administering to said patient a pharmaceutically acceptable composition of this invention. Preferably, the methods of this invention are used to treat a patient suffering from a HCV infection. Such treatment may completely eradicate the viral infection or reduce the severity thereof. More preferably, the patient is a human being.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternate embodiment, the methods of this invention additionally comprise the step of administering to said patient an anti-viral agent preferably an anti-HCV agent. Such anti-viral agents include, but are not limited to, immunomodulatory agents, such as α-, β-, and γ-interferons, pegylated derivatized interferon-α compounds, and thymosin; other anti-viral agents, such as ribavirin and amantadine; other inhibitors of hepatitis C proteases (NS2-NS3 inhibitors and NS3-NS4A inhibitors); inhibitors of other targets in the HCV life cycle, including helicase and polymerase inhibitors; inhibitors of internal ribosome entry; broad-spectrum viral inhibitors, such as IMPDH inhibitors (the IMPDH inhibitors disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,876, mycophenolic acid and derivatives thereof); or combinations of any of the above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch additional agent may be administered to said patient as part of a single dosage form comprising both a compound of this invention and an additional anti-viral agent. Alternatively the additional agent may be administered separately from the compound of this invention, as part of a multiple dosage form, wherein said additional agent is administered prior to, together with or following a composition comprising a compound of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment the present invention provides a method of pre-treating a biological substance intended for administration to a patient comprising the step of contacting said biological substance with a pharmaceutically acceptable composition comprising a compound of this invention. Such biological substances include, but are not limited to, blood and components thereof such as plasma, platelets, subpopulations of blood cells and the like; organs such as kidney, liver, heart, lung, etc; sperm and ova; bone marrow and components thereof, and other fluids to be infused into a patient such as saline, dextrose, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to another embodiment the invention provides methods of treating materials that may potentially come into contact with a virus characterized by a virally encoded serine protease necessary for its life cycle. This method comprises the step of contacting said material with a compound according to the invention. Such materials include, but are not limited to, surgical instruments and garments (e.g. clothes, gloves, aprons, gowns, masks, eyeglasses, footwear, etc.); laboratory instruments and garments (e.g. clothes, gloves, aprons, gowns, masks, eyeglasses, footwear, etc.); blood collection apparatuses and materials; and invasive devices, such as shunts, stents, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the compounds of this invention may be used as laboratory tools to aid in the isolation of a virally encoded serine protease. This method comprises the steps of providing a compound of this invention attached to a solid support; contacting said solid support with a sample containing a viral serine protease under conditions that cause said protease to bind to said solid support; and eluting said serine protease from said solid support. Preferably, the viral serine protease isolated by this method is HCV NS3-NS4A protease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order that this invention be more fully understood, the following preparative and testing examples are set forth. These examples are for the purpose of illustration only and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples present preferred embodiments and techniques, but are not intended to be limiting. Those of skill in the art will, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific materials and methods which are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nHCV NS3 Protease HPLC Peptide Cleavage Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay is a modification of that described by Landro et al. [Landro J. A. et al., \nBiochemistry, \n36, pp. 9340-9348 (1997)]. A single peptide substrate (NS5AB), based on the NS5A/NS5B cleavage site for genotype 1a HCV, was used with all proteases. The substrate stock solution (25 mM) was prepared in DMSO containing 0.2M DTT and stored at −20° C. A synthetic peptide cofactor (KK4A) appropriate to each genotype was used as a substitute for the central core region of NS4A. Peptide sequences are shown below. The hydrolysis reaction was performed in a 96-well microtiter plate format using 25 nM to 50 nM HCV NS3 protease in buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mM DTT and 25 μM KK4A. The final DMSO concentration was no greater than 2% v/v. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to yield a final TFA concentration of 2.5%. Enzymatic activity was assessed by separation of substrate and products on a reverse phase microbore HPLC column (Phenomenex Jupiter 5μ C18 300A column, 150×2.0 mm), which was heated to 40° C. using a thermostated column chamber using an Agilent series 1100 instrument with autoinjection and diode array detection at 210 and 280 nm. The flow rate was 0.2 mL/min, with H\n2\nO/0.1% TFA (solvent A) and CH\n3\nCN/0.1% TFA (solvent B). A linear gradient was used; 5 to 60% solvent B over 12 minutes, then 60% to 100% solvent B over 1 min, 3 min isocratic, followed by 1 min to 5% solvent B and finished with 10 min post time using 5% solvent B isocratic. The SMSY product peak, which typically has a retention time of 10 min, was analyzed using the data collected at 210 nM.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide Sequences Used with HCV NS3 protease\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenotype\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nSequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA11\n\n\nNS5AB\n\n\nNH\n2\n-EDVV-(alpha)Abu-CSMSY-COOH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1a\n\n\nKK4A\n\n\nNH\n2\n-KKGSVVIVGRIVLSGK-\nCOOH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2a\n\n\nKK4A\n\n\nNH\n2\n-KKGSVSIIGRLHINQRA-\nCOOH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3a\n\n\nKK4A\n\n\nNH\n2\n-KKGSVVIVGHIELGGKP-COOH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor determination of the kinetic parameters Km and Vmax, the NS5AB substrate was varied between 3 μM and 200 μM.

All reactions were performed in a buffer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 100 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mM DTT and 25 μM KK4A (Buffer A), using the RET-Si fluorescent peptide (AnaSpec, San Jose, Calif.) as substrate. Final DMSO concentrations were maintained at 1-2% (v/v).

The reactions were quenched by the addition of 25 μL 10% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Enzymatic activity was assessed by separation of substrate and products on a reverse phase microbore HPLC column (Phenomenex Jupiter 5μ C18 300A column, 150×2.0 mm), which was heated to 40° C. using a thermostated column chamber using an Agilent series 1100 instrument with autoinjection and fluorescence detection with excitation at 350 nm and detection at 490 nm.

An aliquot of VX-950 dissolved in 100% DMSO was added to the pre-heated enzyme stock at time zero. The reaction was initiated at time points ranging from 5 to 360 minutes by addition of a 5 μL aliquot of RET-S1 in Buffer A to a 95 μL aliquot of the enzyme-inhibitor mixture, yielding final concentrations of 4 μM RET-S1 and 5 nM to 20 nM HCV NS3 protease. The change in fluorescence was monitored over a 150 second window, and the rate of reaction was determined from a linear regression of the fluorescence vs. time data points. Control rates were determined from a reaction containing neat DMSO. Seven to eight concentrations of compound were used to titrate enzyme activity for inhibition. IC50 values were calculated from activity vs. inhibitor concentration data using a standard logistic 2 parameter fit.

Cells containing hepatitis C virus (HCV) replicon were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.25 mg per ml of G418, with appropriate supplements (media A).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn \nday\n 1, replicon cell monolayer was treated with a trypsin:EDTA mixture, removed, and then media A was diluted into a final concentration of 100,000 cells per ml wit. 10,000 cells in 100 ul were plated into each well of a 96-well tissue culture plate, and cultured overnight in a tissue culture incubator at 37° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn \nday\n 2, compounds (in 100% DMSO) were serially diluted into DMEM containing 2% FBS, 0.5% DMSO, with appropriate supplements (media B). The final concentration of DMSO was maintained at 0.5% throughout the dilution series.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMedia on the replicon cell monolayer was removed, and then media B containing various concentrations of compounds was added. Media B without any compound was added to other wells as no compound controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells were incubated with compound or 0.5% DMSO in media B for 48 hours in a tissue culture incubator at 37° C. At the end of the 48-hour incubation, the media was removed, and the replicon cell monolayer was washed once with PBS and stored at −80° C. prior to RNA extraction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCulture plates with treated replicon cell monolayers were thawed, and a fixed amount of another RNA virus, such as Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV) was added to cells in each well. RNA extraction reagents (such as reagents from RNeasy kits) were added to the cells immediately to avoid degradation of RNA. Total RNA was, extracted according the instruction of manufacturer with modification to improve extraction efficiency and consistency. Finally, total cellular RNA, including HCV replicon RNA, was eluted and stored at −80° C. until further processing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Taqman real-time RT-PCR quantification assay was set up with two sets of specific primers and probe. One was for HCV and the other was for BVDV. Total RNA extractants from treated HCV replicon cells was added to the PCR reactions for quantification of both HCV and BVDV RNA in the same PCR well. Experimental failure was flagged and rejected based on the level of BVDV RNA in each well. The level of HCV RNA in each well was calculated according to a standard curve run in the same PCR plate. The percentage of inhibition or decrease of HCV RNA level due to compound treatment was calculated using the DMSO or no compound control as 0% of inhibition. The 1050 (concentration at which 50% inhibition of HCV RNA level is observed) was calculated from the titration curve of any given compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVX-950 was found to have an 1050 of 354 nM in this replicon assay.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nConsensus Sequences of the HCV NS3 Serine Protease Domain and NS4A Cofactor Peptide for \n \n \n \nGenotype\n \n \n \n 2a, 2b, 3a, or 3b\n\n\n \n \n \nThe nucleotide sequences of cDNA fragment covering the NS3 serine protease domain and NS4A cofactor peptide of many. HCV isolates were obtained from GenBank and aligned using DNAstar software. These \ngenotype\n 2 isolates include eight from \ngenotype\n 2a (GenBank accession code P26660, AF177036, AB031663, D50409, AF169002, AF169003, AF238481, AF238482) and three from \ngenotype\n 2b (GenBank accession code P26661, AF238486, AB030907). The alignment of amino acid sequence of these eleven \ngenotype\n 2 HCV NS3 serine protease domains is shown in \nFIG. 1\n. The consensus amino acid and nucleotide sequence of \ngenotype\n 2a NS3 serine protease domain is shown in \nFIG. 2\n. These genotype 3 isolates include four from \ngenotype\n 3a (GenBank accession code AF046866, D17763, D28917, X76918) and two from \ngenotype\n 3b (GenBank accession code D49374 and D63821). The alignment of amino acid sequence of these six genotype 3 HCV NS3 serine protease domains is shown in \nFIG. 3\n. The consensus amino acid and nucleotide sequence of \ngenotype\n 3a NS3 serine protease domain is shown in \nFIG. 4\n. Finally, an alignment of the consensus amino acid sequence of each genotype or \n \n \n \n \nsubgenotype\n \n \n \n \n 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a and 3b is shown in \nFIG. 5\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasmid Construction. Amino acid and nucleotide sequences of the DNA fragment encoding residues Ala\n1\n-Ser\n181 \nof several isolates of \n \ngenotype\n \n 2a or 2b were obtained from GenBank and aligned to identify a consensus sequence for \n \ngenotype\n \n 2a or 2b NS3 serine protease domain. The same applied to genotype 3a or 3b to identify a consensus sequence of \n \ngenotype\n \n 3a or 3b HCV NS3 serine protease domain. The cDNA fragments of these consensus sequences were created by oligonucleotide synthesis (Genscript) using the \nE. coli \noptimal codon usage, and then amplified by PCR and subcloned into pBEV11 for expression of the HCV proteins with a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag in \nE. coli\n. The amino acid #13 of the HCV NS3 serine protease, Leu was substituted with a Lys for a solubilizing variant. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression and purification of the HCV NS3 serine protease domain. Each of the expression constructs for the HCV NS3 serine protease domain of \n \ngenotype\n \n 2a or 3a was transformed into BL21/DE3 pLysS \nE. coli \ncells (Stratagene). Freshly transformed cells were grown, at 37° C. in a BHI medium (Difco Laboratories) supplemented with 100 μg per ml carbenicillin and 35 μg per ml chloramphenicol to an optical density of 0.75 at 600 nM. Induction with 1 mM IPTG was performed for four hours at, 24° C. Cell pastes were harvested by centrifugation and flash frozen at −80° C. prior to protein purification. All purification steps were performed at 4° C. For each of the HCV NS3 proteases, 100 g of cell paste was lysed in 1.5 L of buffer A [50 mM HEPES (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, 5 mM β-3-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol] and stirred for 30 min. The lysates were homogenized using a Microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton, Mass.), followed by ultra-centrifugation at 54,000×g for 45 min. Imidazole was added to the supernatants to a final concentration of 5 mM along with 2 ml of Ni-NTA resin pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 5 mM imidazole. The mixtures were rocked for three hours and washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A plus 5 mM imidazole. The HCV NS3 proteins were eluted in buffer A containing 300 mM imidazole. The eluates were concentrated and loaded onto a Hi-Load 16/60 Superdex 200 column, pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The appropriate fractions of the purified HCV proteins were pooled and stored at −80° C.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\n \n \n \nHaving determined the consensus domain of the HCV genotypes, the NS3 serine protease domain protein was expressed in \nE. coli \nand purified to homogeneity. Enzyme assays for VX-950 were conducted with a KK-4A peptide (Landro et al., 1997 Biochemistry) and a FRET substrate (Taliani et al., 1997 Anal. Biochem.). The Ki* for VX-950 was determined using a steady state method and confirmed, by two other methods (extended incubation and progress curves).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsolation of the consensus domain allowed a determination of the binding characteristics of VX-950 to the domain of HCV-1 as compared to HCV-2. The inventors showed that VX-950 has a several-fold better activity than other inhibitors that been described by those of skill in the art. The data obtained by the inventors show that the binding of VX-950 to the NS3-4A serine protease is a reversible, covalent, competitive, tight and slow binding. As such, this agent has a different mechanism of inhibitory action than other agents that are presently under development. For example, other agents were seen to bind to the protease and the binding was reversible, non-covalent, competitive and tight. More importantly, it was determined that at the binding site of \ngenotype\n 1 there is a Val-Asp-Gln at residues 78-80 and amino acid 56 whereas in \ngenotype\n 2 there is a Ala-Glu-Gly. This difference in amino acids at those residues means that there is a lower conformational stability of the loop that is present in the serine protease in the HCV genotype as compared to the stability of the loop in the \nHCV genotype\n 1. While the lower conformational stability decreases the binding of some inhibitors, this decrease in conformational stability is expected to have little effect on the binding of VX-950, making this inhibitor a more potent inhibitor of serine proteases from \ngenotype\n 2 HCV. Similar results were seen with genotype 3 HCV in which there is a substitution of Gln for the Asp168 that is \npresent genotype\n 1 HCV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile a number of embodiments of this invention have been described, it is apparent that the basic examples may be altered to provide other embodiments which utilize the compounds and methods of this invention. Therefore, it will be appreciated that the scope of this invention is to be defined by the appended claims rather than by the specific embodiments that have been represented by way of example above.

No. X76534 EMBL) , referred to herein as GPNMB, was identified and described by \nWeterman et al., (Int J Cancer 60:73-81, 1995\n) as differentially expressed in low-metastatic human melanoma cancer cell lines and xenografts, compared to a more aggressive melanoma cell line. GPNMB shares 33% identity with the precursor of pMe117 melanocyte-specific protein (\nKwon et al., 1991, PNAS 88:9228-9232\n). GPNMB is 71% homologous to a dendritic cell-associated transmembrane protein, DC-HIL (\nShikano et al., 2001 Biol. Chem. 276:8125-8134\n). GPNMB is also know as the hematopoietic growth factor inducible neurokinin-1 protein HGFIN (\nBandari et al, Reg. Peptides 111:169-178\n) and the bone-related gene osteoactivin (\nOwen et al. Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr 2003, 13(2-4):205-220\n)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was also reported that nmb could reduce the metastatic potential of highly metastatic nmb-negative melanoma cell line (Weterman, 1995). GPNMB was considered a candidate glioblastoma tumor marker after public database mining and expression profiling (\nLoging et al., 2000, Genome Research 10:1393-1402\n). This gene was found overexpressed in lung tumors (US Patent Publication No. \n \nUS20030064947\n \n), as well as breast, rectal and colon cancers (US Patent Publication No. \n \nUS2003100720\n \n). NCBI SAGE data also shows overexpression of this gene in stomach and pancreatic carcinoma. The mouse ortholog has been shown to be highly upregulated in a neural stem cell line NSC, derived from the TSC2 knockout model for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Syndrome (International Publication No. \n \nWO 2003/080856\n \n).\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are typically tetrameric glycosylated proteins composed of two light (L) chains (about 25 kDa) and two heavy (H) chains (about 50-70 kDa). The amino-terminal portion of each chain includes a variable domain of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy-terminal portion of the L and H chain has one and three or four constant domains, respectively that are primarily responsible for effector function. There are two types of human L chains, classified as kappa and lambda. H chains are classified as mu, delta, gamma, alpha, or epsilon based upon the constant domain amino acid sequence, defining the antibody's isotype as IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA, and IgE, respectively. Isotypes may be further divided into subclasses e.g. IgG\n1,\n IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, IgG\n4\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoglobulins can be produced naturally \nin vivo\n by B lymphocytes. Each clone of B cells produces antibody with an antigen receptor having a unique prospective antigen binding structure. The repertoire of antigen receptors, approximately 10\n7\n possibilities, exists \nin vivo\n prior to antigen stimulation. This diversity is produced by somatic recombination, \ni.e.,\n the joining of different antibody gene segments. Immunoglobulin H chain, kappa L chain and lambda L chain are encoded by three separate genetic loci and each locus has multiple copies of at least 3 types of gene segments encoding variable (V), constant (C) and joining (J) regions, the heavy chain gene also includes a diversity (D) region. The selection of specific V, C and J regions (and D for the heavy chain) from amongst the various gene segments available (45 heavy chain V; 35 kappa V; 23 heavy chain D; 6 heavy chain J; 5 kappa J) generates approximately 10\n11\n possible specificities of gennline sequences exhibited in B cells. The joining of V, C and J regions can result in the loss or addition of residues at the junctions. The L and H chain V region of human antibodies consists of relatively conserved framework regions (FR) that form a scaffold for three hypervariable regions also known as complementary determining regions (CDR). From the amino terminus of either the heavy or light chain, the V domain is made up of FR and CDR regions in the following order: FR1-CDRI-FR2-CDR2-FR3. Joining of the V domain with a D (heavy chain only) and J domain adds CDR3-FR4. The CDRs are generally responsible for antigen binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specificity of monoclonal antibodies have made them attractive agents for targeting cancer in vivo with the hopes of eradicating disease while sparing normal tissue. The approach, which initially utilized mouse monoclonal antibodies has encountered limitations to potential effectiveness such as immunogenicity; inefficient effector functions and short half-life in vivo. Technologies were developed for: chimeric antibodies which sought to utilize the antigen binding variable domains of mouse monoclonal antibodies combined with the constant regions of human antibodies \n(\n \nBoulianne, et al. 1984 Nature 312:643-646\n \n;\n \nMorrison et al, 1984 PNAS USA 81: G851-G855\n \n);\n humanized antibodies which grafted antigen binding complementary determining regions (CDRs) from mouse antibodies to human immunoglobulin \n(\n \nJones, et al, 1986 Nature 321: 522-525\n \n;\n \nRiechmann, et al, 1988 Nature 332:323-327\n \n;\n \nVerhoeyen, et al, 1988 Science 239:1534-1536\n \n;\n \nVaughan, et al, 1998 Nature Biotechnol. 16:535-539\n \n);\n and phage display libraries of single chain scFvs or Fab fragments of antibodies \n(\n \nde Haard, et al, 1999 JBiol.

Immunol 163, 6898-6906\n \n).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nSingle Chain Antibodies:\n Single chain Fv antibodies (scFvs) were first described in the late 1980's \n(\n \nBird et al., Science 242:423-426 (1988\n); \nHuston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883 (1988\n)). A polypeptide linker, typically ranging in length from 5 to 27 amino acid residues, is used to join the C-terminus of the variable light chain domain (V\nL\n) to the N-terminus of the variable heavy chain domain (V\nH\n). Alternatively, the linker joins the C-terminus of the V\nH\n to the N-terminus of the V\nL\n. Both formats (V\nL\n-V\nH\n and V\nH\n V\nL\n) have been used successfully in the literature. The most common linker used in the literature is the (Gly\n4\nSer)\n3\n 15 amino acid linker, however there are several other linkers that have been utilized, including a 25 amino acid linker called 205C (\nPantoliano et al., Biochemistry 30:10117-10125 (1991\n)). Single chain antibodies are currently in the clinic; one of the most advanced is h5G1.1 or Pexelizumab. This scFv is specific for human C5 complement and is being used in clinical trials for cardiac patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery (\nShernan et al., Ann. Thorac Surg. 77:942-949 (2004\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nBispecific Antibodies (bi-Abs):\n An area of mAb research where considerable progress has been made is in the development ofbispecific antibodies (biAbs). There are distinct advantages to developing therapeutic antibody molecules with dual specificity. For example, biAbs can serve as mediators to target immune effector cells such as CTLs to unwanted cells (\nBaeuerle et al., Curr. Opin. Mol. Ther. 5:413-419 (2003\n)). In another example, chemically linked bispecific antibodies directed against Fc gamma receptors CD16, CD64, and CD89, were significantly more effective in vitro than conventional IgG antibodies (\nPeipp and Valerius, Biochem. Soc. Trans. 30:507-511 (2002\n)). One of the challenges in developing biAbs as viable therapeutics has been producing large enough quantities of a stable moiety for clinical applications. Another challenge has been in determining the right combination of validated targets and the underlying biology that would lead to a therapeutic product. For recent reviews on the difficulties experienced with biAbs, see (\nKontermann, Acta Pharmacol Sin 26:1-9 (2005\n); \nPeipp and Valerius, Soc. Trans. 30:507-511 (2002\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nBispecific Single Chain Antibodies (bi-scFv):\n A notable type of biAb that can be made is a bi-specific single chain antibody or bi-scFv. For a review on the generation of bi-scFv's see (\nKipriyanov and Le Gall, Curr Opin Drug Discov Devel 7:233-242 (2004\n)). Bi-scFvs are typically comprised of 4 variable domains, 2 heavy (V\nH\n) and 2 light (V\nL\n), which are derived from 2 different antibodies. The 4 domains are linked together with 3 short linlcers, ranging in length from 5-27 amino acids. The biological activity of this type of antibody depends on several features concerning the construction of the molecule. For example, both the linker sequences between the antibody V domains and the order of the 4 antibody V domains themselves (for the 2 antibodies) can vary, as well as the expression system that is used; all of which can greatly affect the solubility and biological activity of the various resulting products (\nKipriyanov et al., J. Mol. Biol. 330:99-111 (2003\n); \nLe Gall et al., Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 17:357-366 (2004\n); \nPavlinkova et al., Clin Cancer Res. 5:2613-1619 (1999\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCytotoxic T lymphocytes:\n Under normal circumstances, T cells are activated when the CD3/T cell receptor (CD3/TCR) complex binds to a relevant MHC molecule associated with a specific Ag peptide. Engagement of CD3/TCR with MHC results in intracellular signals necessary to trigger an immune response against a pathogen or tumor. Similar signals that cause T cell activation can also be achieved by antibodies that can bind certain structures of the CD3/TCR complex. In the literature, it has been shown that biAbs recognizing both the TCR/CD3 complex and tumor associated antigen (TAA) can trigger the activation program in CTLs in the presence of target cells (\nChapoval et al., J. Immunol 155:1296-1303(1995\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant technologies are being utilized to enable further improvements upon antibody molecules with the goal of enhancing in vivo efficacy. Such technologies provide, for example, for optimizing molecular size, affinity, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, specificity, valency, effector functions, direct and indirect arming, combination therapy, and various prodrug approaches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt would be desirable to have an antibody suitable for \nin vivo\n targeting of GPNMB expressing pathologies and to enable therapeutic efficacy.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe current invention provides human monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind GPNMB as well as variants, derivatives and antigen binding fragments of such antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides preferred somatic recombinations of human antibody gene segments to provide specificity for GPNMB and genetically engineered anti-GPNMB antibody variants and derivatives that originate from these gene segments.

The term includes, but is not limited to, polyclonal, monoclonal, monospecific, polyspecific, non-specific, humanized, single-chain, chimeric, synthetic, recombinant, hybrid, mutated, engineered, and grafted antibodies. Unless otherwise modified by the term \"intact,\" as in \"intact antibodies,\" for the purposes of this disclosure, the term \"antibody\" also includes antibody fragments such as Fab, F(ab')\n2\n, Fv, scFv, bi-scFv, bi-Ab, Fd, dAb, and other antibody fragments that retain antigen-binding function, \ni.e.,\n the ability to bind GPNMB specifically. Typically, such fragments would comprise an antigen-binding domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms \"antigen-binding domain,\" \"antigen-binding fragment,\" and \"binding fragment\" refer to a part of an antibody molecule that comprises amino acids responsible for the specific binding between the antibody and the antigen. In instances, where an antigen is large, the antigen-binding domain may only bind to a part of the antigen. A portion of the antigen molecule that is responsible for specific interactions with the antigen-binding domain is referred to as \"epitope\" or \"antigenic determinant.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antigen-binding domain typically comprises an antibody light chain variable region (V\nL\n) and an antibody heavy chain variable region (V\nH\n), however, it does not necessarily have to comprise both. For example, a so-called Fd antibody fragment consists only of a V\nH\n domain, but still retains some antigen-binding function of the intact antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"repertoire\" refers to a genetically diverse collection of nucleotides derived wholly or partially from sequences that encode expressed immunoglobulins: The sequences are generated by in vivo rearrangement of, e.g., V, D, and J segments for H chains and, e.g., V and J segment for L chains. Alternatively, the sequences may be generated from a cell line by in vitro stimulation, in response to which the rearrangement occurs. Alternatively, part or all of the sequences may be obtained by combining, e.g., unrearranged V segments with D and J segments, by nucleotide synthesis, randomised mutagenesis, and other methods, e.g., as disclosed in \n \nU.S. Pat. No.5,565,332\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms \"specific interaction\" and \"specific binding\" refer to two molecules forming a complex that is relatively stable under physiologic conditions. Specific binding is characterized by a high affinity and a low to moderate capacity as distinguished from nonspecific binding which usually has a low affinity with a moderate to high capacity. Typically, binding is considered specific when the affinity constant K\nA\n is higher than 10\n6\n M\n-\n or more preferably higher than 10\n8\n M\n-1\n. If necessary, non-specific binding can be reduced without substantially affecting specific binding by varying the binding conditions. The appropriate binding conditions such as concentration of antibodies, ionic strength of the solution, temperature, time allowed for binding, concentration of a blocking agent \n(e.g.,\n serum albumin, milk casein), etc., may be optimized by a skilled artisan using routine techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"substantially as set out\" refers that the relevant CDR, V\nH\n, or V\nL\n domain of the invention will be either identical to or have only insubstantial differences in the specified regions (e.g., a CDR), the sequence of which is set out. Insubstantial differences include minor amino acid changes, such as substitutions of 1 or 2 out of any 5 amino acids in the sequence of a specified region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"CR011\" refers to a fully human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to GPNMB. In some embodiments, CR011 refers to those antibodies that are identified in Tables 2A-2D of the present application. In some embodiments, CR011 refers to Mab 1.15.1 as described in the instant invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"GPNMB\" and \"CG56972\" are used interchangeably herein.

Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. Generally, nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and techniques of, cell and tissue culture, molecular biology, and protein and oligo- or polynucleotide chemistry and hybridization described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques are used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, and tissue culture and transformation \n(e.g.,\n electroporation, lipofection). Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are performed according to manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The foregoing techniques and procedures are generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification. \n(See e.g.,\n \nSambrook et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y. 1989\n \n).\n The nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques are used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe current invention provides germline human antibody heavy chain V, D, J combinations and light chain V, J combinations including nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the V\nH\n and V\nL\n domain FR and CDR regions with specificity for GPNMB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUpon exposure to antigen, those B cells with antigen binding specificity based on germline sequences are activated, proliferate, and differentiate to produce immunoglobulins of different isotypes as well as undergo somatic mutation and/or affinity maturation to produce immunoglobulins of higher affinity for the antigen. The current invention provides the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of such affinity matured V domain FR and CDR regions having specificity to GPNMB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFab type antibody fragments containing the antigen binding portion of the antibody molecule may consist of the L chain covalently linked by a disulfide bond to a portion of the H chain which has the V domain and first constant domain. Single chain Fv antibody fragment (scFv) has the H variable domain linked to the L variable domain by a polypeptide linker. The invention provides antibody fragments such as Fab and scFv molecules having sequences derived from germline or affinity matured V domains of antibodies binding specifically to GPNMB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments (see, e.g., \nSongsivilai & Lachmann, 1990 Clin. Exp. Immunol. 79: 315-321\n; \nKostelny et al., 1992 J. Immunol. 148:1547-1553\n). Bispecific antibodies do not exist in the form of fragments having a single binding site (e.g., Fab, Fab', and Fv).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that such bifunctional or bispecific antibodies are contemplated and encompassed by the invention. A bispecific single chain antibody with specificity to GPNMB and to the CD3 antigen on cytotoxic T lymphocytes can be used to direct these T cells to tumor cells expressing GPNMB and cause apoptosis and eradication of the tumor. Bispecific scFv constructs for this purpose are described herein. The scFv components specific for GPNMB can be derived from anti-GPNMB antibodies described herein. In some embodiments, the anti-GPNMB antibody components disclosed herein can be used to generate a biologically active scFv directed against GPNMB. The anti-CD3 scFv component of the therapeutic bispecific scFv was derived from a sequence deposited in Genbank (accession number CAE85148). Alternative antibodies known to target CD3 or other T cell antigens may similarly be effective in treating malignancies when coupled with anti-GPNMB, whether on a single-chain backbone or a full IgG.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGPNMB binding human antibodies may include H or L constant domains including L kappa or lambda constant regions, or any isotype H constant domain.

Preferably with an affinity of 10\n-7\n or greater and even more preferably 10\n-8\n or greater. In a preferred embodiment, antibodies described herein bind to GPNMB with very high affinities (Kd), for example a human antibody that is capable of binding GPNMB with a Kd less than, but not limited to, 10\n-1\n, 10\n-8\n, 10\n-9\n 10\n-10\n, 10\n-11\n, 10\n-12\n, 10\n-13\n or 10\n-14\n M, or any range or value therein. Affinity and/or avidity measurements can be measured by KinExA\n®\n and/or BIACORE\n®\n, as described herein. In particular embodiments antibodies of the invention bind to GPNMB with Kds ranging from 50 to 150 pM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEpitope mapping and secondary and tertiary structure analyses can be carried out to identify specific 3D structures assumed by the disclosed antibodies and their complexes with antigens (see, \ne.g.,\n \nEpitope Mapping Protocols, ed. Morris, Humana Press, 1996\n). Such methods include, but are not limited to, X-ray crystallography (\nBiochem. Exp. Biol., 11: 7-13, 1974\n \n)\n and computer modeling of virtual representations of the presently disclosed antibodies (\nFletterick et al. (1986) Computer Graphics and Molecular Modeling, in Current Communications in Molecular Biology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Cold Spring Harbor. N.Y\n)\n.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the specific part of the protein immunogen recognized by antibody may be determined by assaying the antibody reactivity to parts of the protein, for example an N terminal and C terminal half. The resulting reactive fragment can then be further dissected, assaying consecutively smaller parts of the immunogen with the antibody until the minimal reactive peptide is defined. Alternatively, the binding specificity, that is the epitope, of anti-GPNMB antibodies of the invention may be determined by subjecting GPNMB immunogen to SDS-PAGE either in the absence or presence of a reduction agent and analyzed by immunoblotting. Epitope mapping may also be performed using SELDI. SELDI ProteinChip® (LumiCyte) arrays used to define sites of protein-protein interaction. GPNMB protein antigen or fragments thereof may be specifically captured by antibodies covalently immobilized onto the PROTEINCHIP array surface. The bound antigens may be detected by a laser-induced desorption process and analyzed directly to determine their mass.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe epitope recognized by anti-GPNMB antibodies described herein may be determined by exposing the PROTEINCHIP Array to a combinatorial library of random peptide 12-mer displayed on Filamentous phage (New England Biolabs). Antibody-bound phage are eluted and then amplified and taken through additional binding and amplification cycles to enrich the pool in favor of binding sequences. After three or four rounds, individual binding clones are further tested for binding by phage ELISA assays performed on antibody-coated wells and characterized by specific DNA sequencing of positive clones.\n\n\n \n\n\nDerivatives\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis disclosure also provides a method for obtaining an antibody specific for GPNMB. CDRs in such antibodies are not limited to the specific sequences of H and L variable domains identified in Table 1 and may include variants of these sequences that retain the ability to specifically bind GPNMB. Such variants may be derived from the sequences listed in Table 1 by a skilled artisan using techniques well known in the art. For example, amino acid substitutions, deletions, or additions, can be made in the FRs and/or in the CDRs. While changes in the FRs are usually designed to improve stability and immunogenicity of the antibody, changes in the CDRs are typically designed to increase affinity of the antibody for its target. Variants of FRs also include naturally occurring immunoglobulin allotypes. Such affinity-increasing changes may be determined empirically by routine techniques that involve altering the CDR and testing the affinity of the antibody for its target. For example, conservative amino acid substitutions can be made within any one of the disclosed CDRs. Various alterations can be made according to the methods described in the art (\nAntibody Engineering, 2.sup.nd ed., Oxford University Press, ed. Borrebaeck. 1995\n). These include but are not limited to nucleotide sequences that are altered by the substitution of different codons that encode a functionally equivalent amino acid residue within the sequence, thus producing a \"silent\" change. For example, the nonpolar amino acids include alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine. The polar neutral amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine. The positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine, and histidine. The negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Substitutes for an amino acid within the sequence may be selected from other members of the class to which the amino acid belongs (see Table 3). Furthermore, any native residue in the polypeptide may also be substituted with alanine \n(\n \nActa Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 643:55-67, 1998\n \n;\n \nAdv. Biophys. 35:1-24, 1998\n \n).\n\n\n \nTABLE 3.

(1995) The Practice of Peptide Synthesis, 2.sup.nd ed., Spring Verlag, Berlin, Germany\n)\n.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and (4) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties of such analogs. Analogs can include various muteins of a sequence other than the naturally-occurring peptide sequence. For example, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (preferably conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (preferably in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts). A conservative amino acid substitution should not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in the art (for example, \nProteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984\n \n)\n)\n.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a method for making an H variable domain which is an amino acid sequence variant of an H variable domain of the invention comprises a step of adding, deleting, substituting, or inserting one or more amino acids in the amino acid sequence of the presently disclosed H variable domain, optionally combining the H variable domain thus provided with one or more L variable domains, and testing the H variable domain or H variable/L variable combination or combinations for specific binding to GPNMB or and, optionally, testing the ability of such antigen-binding domain to modulate GPNMB activity. The L variable domain may have an amino acid sequence that is identical or is substantially as set out according to Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn analogous method can be employed in which one or more sequence variants of a L variable domain disclosed herein are combined with one or more H variable domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the disclosure provides a method of preparing antigen-binding fragment that specifically binds with GPNMB. The method comprises: (a) providing a starting repertoire of nucleic acids encoding a H variable domain that either includes a CDR3 to be replaced or lacks a CDR3 encoding region; (b) combining the repertoire with a donor nucleic acid encoding an amino acid sequence substantially as set out herein for a H variable CDR3 such that the donor nucleic acid is inserted into the CDR3 region in the repertoire, so as to provide a product repertoire of nucleic acids encoding a H variable domain; (c) expressing the nucleic acids of the product repertoire; (d) selecting a binding fragment specific for GPNMB; and (e) recovering the specific binding fragment or nucleic acid encoding it.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgain, an analogous method may be employed in which a L variable CDR3 of the invention is combined with a repertoire of nucleic acids encoding a L variable domain, which either include a CDR3 to be replaced or lack a CDR3 encoding region. The donor nucleic acid may be selected from nucleic acids encoding an amino acid sequence substantially as set out in SEQ ID NOs: 2, 20, 38, 56, 74, 92, 110, 128, 146, 164, 182, 200, 218, 236, 253, 256, 260, 265, 270, 274, 277, 281, 285, 11, 29, 47, 5, 83, 101, 119, 137, 155, 173, 191, 209, 227 and 245. A sequence encoding a CDR of the invention (e.g., CDR3) may be introduced into a repertoire of variable domains lacking the respective CDR (\ne.g.,\n CDR3), using recombinant DNA technology, for example, using methodology described by \nMarks et al. (BiolTechnology (1992) 10: 779-783\n)\n.\n In particular, consensus primers directed at or adjacent to the 5' end of the variable domain area can be used in conjunction with consensus primers to the third framework region of human H variable genes to provide a repertoire of H variable domains lacking a CDR3. The repertoire may be combined with a CDR3 of a particular antibody. Using analogous techniques, the CDR3-derived sequences may be shuffled with repertoires of H variable or L variable domains lacking a CDR3, and the shuffled complete H variable or L variable domains combined with a cognate L variable or H variable domain to make the GPNMB specific antibodies of the invention. The repertoire may then be displayed in a suitable host system such as the phage display system such as described in \n \nWO92/01047\n \n so that suitable antigen-binding fragments can be selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalogous shuffling or combinatorial techniques may be used (\ne.g.\n \nStemmer, Nature (1994) 370: 389-391\n)\n.\n In further embodiments, one may generate novel H variable or L variable regions carrying one or more sequences derived from the sequences disclosed herein using random mutagenesis of one or more selected H variable and/or L variable genes, such as error-prone PCR (\nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (1992) 89: 3576-3580\n)\n.\n Another method that may be used is to direct mutagenesis to CDRs of H variable or L variable genes (\nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (1994) 91: 3809-3813\n \n;\n \nJ. Mol. Biol. (1996) 263: 551-567\n)\n.\n Similarly, one or more, or all three CDRs may be grafted into a repertoire of H variable or L variable domains, which are then screened for an antigen-binding fragment specific for GPNMB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA portion of an immunoglobulin variable domain will comprise at least one of the CDRs substantially as set out herein and, optionally, intervening framework regions as set out herein. The portion may include at least about 50% of either or both of FR1 and FR4, the 50% being the C-terminal 50% of FRl and the N-terminal 50% of FR4. Additional residues at the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the substantial part of the variable domain may be those not normally associated with naturally occurring variable domain regions. For example, construction of antibodies by recombinant DNA techniques may result in the introduction of N- or C-terminal residues encoded by linkers introduced to facilitate cloning or other manipulation steps. Other manipulation steps include the introduction of linkers to join variable domains to further protein sequences including immunoglobulin heavy chain constant regions, other variable domains (for example, in the production of diabodies), or proteinaceous labels as discussed in further detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough the embodiments illustrated in the Examples comprise a \"matching\" pair of H variable and L variable domains, a skilled artisan will recognize that alternative embodiments may comprise antigen-binding fragments containing only a single CDR from either L variable or H variable domain. Either one of the single chain specific binding domains can be used to screen for complementary domains capable of forming a two-domain specific antigen-binding fragment capable of, for example, binding to GPNMB. The screening may be accomplished by phage display screening methods using the so-called hierarchical dual combinatorial approach disclosed in \n \nWO92/01047\n \n, in which an individual colony containing either an H or L chain clone is used to infect a complete library of clones encoding the other chain (L or H) and the resulting two-chain specific binding domain is selected in accordance with phage display techniques as described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-GPNMB antibodies described herein can be linked to another functional molecule, e.g., another peptide or protein (albumin, another antibody, etc.), toxin, radioisotope, cytotoxic or cytostatic agents. For example, the antibodies can be linked by chemical cross-linking or by recombinant methods. The antibodies may also be linked to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes, in the manner set forth in \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835\n \n; \n \n4,496,689\n \n; \n \n4,301,144\n \n; \n \n4,670,417\n \n; \n \n4,791,192\n \n; or \n \n4,179,337\n \n. The antibodies can be chemically modified by covalent conjugation to a polymer, for example, to increase their circulating half-life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary polymers and methods to attach them are also shown in \n \nU.S. Pat. Nos. 4,766,106\n \n; \n \n4,179,337\n \n; \n \n4,495,285\n \n, and \n \n4,609,546\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disclosed antibodies may also be altered to have a glycosylation pattern that differs from the native pattern. For example, one or more carbohydrate moieties can be deleted and/or one or more glycosylation sites added to the original antibody. Addition of glycosylation sites to the presently disclosed antibodies may be accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence to contain glycosylation site consensus sequences known in the art. Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the antibodies is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the amino acid residues of the antibody (\n \nWO 87/05330\n \n \n;\n \nCRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., 22: 259-306, 1981\n)\n.\n Removal of any carbohydrate moieties from the antibodies may be accomplished chemically or enzymatically (\nArch. Biochem. Biophys., 259: 52, 1987\n \n;\n \nAnal. Biochem., 118: 131, 1981\n \n;\n \nMeth. Enzymol., 138: 350, 1987\n \n).\n The antibodies may also be tagged with a detectable, or functional, label. Detectable labels include radiolabels such as \n131\nI or \n99\nTc, which may also be attached to antibodies using conventional chemistry. Detectable labels also include enzyme labels such as horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase. Detectable labels further include chemical moieties such as biotin, which may be detected via binding to a specific cognate detectable moiety, e.g., labeled avidin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe valency of the antibodies may be custom designed to affect affinity and avidity, retention time at binding sites (see \ne.g.\n \nAm H. Pathol, 2002 160:1597-1608\n \n;\n \nJ. Med. Chem. 2002 45:2250-2259\n \n;\n \nBr. J. Cancer 2002 86:1401-1410\n \n;\n \nBiomol. Eng. 2001 18:95-108\n \n;\n \nInt J. Cancer 2002 100:367-374\n \n).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nMultiple specificity (bifunctional) binding reagents may be designed based upon the GPNMB specific sequences of the invention (\nBiomol. Eng.2001 18:31-40\n)\n.\n For example, a bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy/light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab' fragments (\nClin. Exp. Immunol. 1990, 79: 315-321\n \n;,\n \nJ. Immunol. 199,2148:1547-1553\n)\n.\n Such bispecific antibodies can be generated comprising a specificity to GPNMB and a second specificity to a second molecule using techniques that are well known (\nImmunol Methods 1994,4: 72-81\n \n; Wright and Harris, supra. ;\n \nTraunecker et al. 1992 Int. J. Cancer (Suppl.) 7:51-52\n)\n.\n Bispecific antibodies prepared in this manner selectively kill cells expressing GPNMB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies, in which CDR sequences differ only insubstantially from those set out in SEQ ID NOs: 4, 6, 8, 13, 15, 17, 22, 24,26, 31, 33, 35,40, 42, 44, 49, 51, 53, 58, 60, 62, 67, 69, 71, 76, 78, 80, 85, 87, 89, 94, 96, 98, 103, 105, 107, 112, 114, 116, 121, 123, 125, 130, 132, 134, 139, 141, 143, 148, 150, 152, 157, 159, 161, 166, 168, 170, 175, 177, 179, 184, 186, 188, 193, 195, 197, 202, 204, 206, 211, 213, 215, 220, 222, 224, 229, 231, 233, 238, 240, 242, 247, 249 and 251.

Typically, an amino acid is substituted by a related amino acid having similar charge, hydrophobic, or stereochemical characteristics. Such substitutions would be within the ordinary skills of an artisan. Unlike in CDRs, more substantial changes can be made in FRs without adversely affecting the binding properties of an antibody. Changes to FRs include, but are not limited to engineering certain framework residues that are important for antigen contact or for stabilizing the binding site, e.g., changing the class or subclass of the constant region, changing specific amino acid residues which might alter the effector function such as Fc receptor binding \n(\n \n \nU.S. Pat.

The method comprises expressing the encoded product from the encoding nucleic acid. Expression may be achieved by culturing under appropriate conditions recombinant host cells containing the nucleic acid. Following production by expression, a H variable or L variable domain, or specific binding member may be isolated and/or purified using any suitable technique, then used as appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen-binding fragments, H variable and/or L variable domains and encoding nucleic acid molecules and vectors may be isolated and/or purified from their natural environment, in substantially pure or homogeneous form, or, in the case of nucleic acid, free or substantially free of nucleic acid or genes of origin other than the sequence encoding a polypeptide with the required function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSystems for cloning and expression of a polypeptide in a variety of different host cells are well known in the art including cells suitable for producing antibodies \n(\n \nGene Expression Systems, Academic Press, eds. Fernandez et al., 1999\n \n).\n Briefly, suitable host cells include bacteria, plant cells, mammalian cells, and yeast and baculovirus systems. Mammalian cell lines available in the art for expression of a heterologous polypeptide include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney cells, NSO mouse myeloma cells, and many others. A common bacterial host is \nE. coli.\n Any protein expression system compatible with the invention may be used to produce the disclosed antibodies. Suitable expression systems also include transgenic animals \n(\n \nGene Expression Systems, Academic Press, eds. Fernandez et al., 1999\n \n).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable vectors can be chosen or constructed, so that they contain appropriate regulatory sequences, including promoter sequences, terminator sequences, polyadenylation sequences, enhancer sequences, marker genes and other sequences as appropriate. Vectors may be plasmids or viral, e.g., phage, or phagemid, as appropriate \n(see\n \nSambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2.sup.nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989\n \n).\n Many known techniques and protocols for manipulation of nucleic acid, for example, in preparation of nucleic acid constructs, mutagenesis, sequencing, introduction of DNA into cells and gene expression, and analysis of proteins, are known in the art \n(\n \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology, 2.sup.nd Edition. eds. Ausubel et al., John Wiley & Sons, 1992\n \n).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a host cell comprising a nucleic acid as disclosed herein. A still further aspect provides a method comprising introducing such nucleic acid into a host cell. The introduction may employ any available technique. For eukaryotic cells, suitable techniques may include calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-Dextran, electroporation, liposome-mediated transfection and transduction using retrovirus or other virus, e.g., vaccinia or, for insect cells, baculovirus. For bacterial cells, suitable techniques may include calcium chloride transformation, electroporation and transfection using bacteriophage. The introduction of the nucleic acid into the cells may be followed by causing or allowing expression from the nucleic acid, e.g., by culturing host cells under conditions for expression of the gene.\n\n\n \n\n\nImmunoconjugates\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the antibodies of the invention can be used as a targeting agent for delivery of another therapeutic or a cytotoxic agent to a cell expressing GPNMB. The method includes administering an anti-GPNMB antibody coupled to a therapeutic or a cytotoxic agent or under conditions that allow binding of the antibody to GPNMB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-GPNMB antibodies are conjugated to a therapeutic agent, such as a cytotoxic compound, such that the resulting immunoconjugate exerts a cytotoxic or cytostatic effect on a GPNMB expressing cell. Particularly suitable moieties for conjugation to antibodies are chemotherapeutic agents, prodrug converting enzymes or toxins. For example, an anti-GPNMB antibody can be conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent (see infra) or a toxin (e.g. abrin, ricin A, pseudomonas exotoxin, or diphtheria toxin). Alternatively, anti-GPNMB antibody may be conjugated to a pro-drug converting enzyme. The pro-drug converting enzyme can be recombinantly fused to the antibody or derivative thereof or chemically conjugated thereto using known methods. Examplary pro-drug converting enzymes are carboxypeptidase G2, β-glucuronidase, penicillin-V-amidase, penicillin-G-amidase, β-lactamase, β-glucosidase, nitroreductase and carboxypeptidase A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny agent that exerts a therapeutic effect on GPNMB expressing cells can be used as an agent for conjugation to an anti-GPNMB antibody of the invention. Useful classes of cytotoxic agents include, for example, antitubulin agents, auristatins, DNA minor groove binders, NDA replication inhibitiors, alkylating agents (e.g., platinum complexes such as cis-plantin, mono(platinum), bis(platinum) and tri-nuclear platinum complexes and carboplatin), anthracyclines, antiboiotics, antifolates, antimetabilites, chemotherapy sensitizers, duocarmycins, etoposides, fluorinated purimidines, ionophores, lexitropsins, nitrosoureas, platinols, pre-forming compounds, purine antimetabolites, puromcins, radiation sensitizers, steroids, taxanes, topoisomerase inhibitors, vinca alkaloids, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe therapeutic agent can be a cytotoxic agent. Suitable cytotoxic agents include, for example, dolastatins (e.g. auristatin E, AFP, MMAF, MMAE), DNA minor groove binders \n(eg\n., enediynes and lexitropsins), cuocarmycins, taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel and docetaxel), puromycins, vinca alkaloids, CC-1065, SN-38, topotecan, morpholino-doxorubicin, rhizoxin, cyanomorpholino-doxonibicin, echinomycin, combretastatin, netropsin, epothilone A and B, estramustine, cryptophysins, cemadotin, maytansinoids, discodermolide, eleutherobin, and mitoxantrone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the cytotoxic or cytostatic agent is auristatin E (dolastatin-10) or a derivative thereof (e.g. an ester formed between auristatin E and a keto acid). Other typical auristatin derivatives include AFP, MMAR, and MMAE. The synthesis and structure of auristatin E and its derivates are described in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20030083263\n \n; \n \nPCT/US03/24209\n \n; \n \nPCT/US02/13435\n \n; and \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 6,323,315\n \n; \n \n6,239,104\n \n; \n \n6,034065\n \n; \n \n5,780,588\n \n; \n \n5,665,860\n \n; \n \n5,663,149\n \n; \n \n5,635,483\n \n; \n \n5,599,902\n \n; \n \n5,554,725\n \n; \n \n5,530,097\n \n; \n \n5,521,284\n \n; \n \n5,504,191\n \n; \n \n5,410,024\n \n; \n \n5,138,036\n \n; \n \n5,076,973\n \n; \n \n4,986,988\n \n; \n \n4,978,744\n \n; \n \n4,879,278\n \n; \n \n4,816,444\n \n; and \n \n4,486,414\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment anti-GPNMB antibody 1.15.1 was coupled to monomethylauristatin E via intracellular protease-sensitive valine-citrulline peptide linker (vcMMAE). Methods for making the immunoconjugate can be found in \nDoronina S.O. et al, 2003 Nature Biotechnology 21(7):778-794\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques for conjugating therapeutic agents to proteins, and in particular, antibodies are known in the art (see, \ne.g\n. \nArnon et al., 1985 in Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld et al. eds., Alan R. Liss, Inc., 1985\n; \nHellstrom et al., 1987 in Controlled Drug Delivery, Robinson et al. eds., Marcel Dekker, Inc., 2nd ed. 1987\n; \n \n \nThorpe\n 1985, in Monoclonal Antibodies ' 84: Biological and Clinical Applications, Pinchera et al. eds., EDITOR, 1985\n \n; \nMonoclonal Antibodies for Cancer Detection and Therapy, Baldwin et al. eds., \n; and \nThorpe et al., 1982, Immunol. Rev. 62:119-58\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments of the invention, anti-GPNMB antibodies binding to GPNMB expressing cells, are internalized and accumulate in the cell. Thereby anti-GPNMB antibody immunoconjugates accumulate in GPNMB expressing cells. Typically when the anti-GPNMB antibody immunoconjugate is internalized, the agent is preferentially active. Alternatively, anti GPNMB immunoconjugates are not internalized and the drug is effective to deplete or inhibit GPNMB expressing cells by binding to the cell membrane. The therapeutic agent can be conjugated in a manner that reduces its activity unless it is cleaved off the antibody (e.g. by hydrolysis or by a cleaving agent). In this case, the agent can be attached to the antibody or derivative thereof with a cleavable linker that is sensitive to cleavage in the intracellular environment of the target but is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment, such that the conjugate is cleaved from the antibody or derivative thereof when it is internalized by the GPNMB expressing cell (e.g. in the endosomal or, for example by virtue of pH sensitivity or protease sensitivity, in the lysosomal environament or in a caveolea).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA therapeutic agent of the immunoconjugate can be charged relative to the plasma membrane (e.g. polarized or net charge relative to the plasma membrane), thereby further minimizing the ability of the agent to cross the plasma membrane once internalized by a cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-GPNMB antibody immunoconjugate can comprise a linker region between the therapeutic agent and the antibody. The linker can be cleavable under intracellular conditions, such that cleavage of the linker releases the therapeutic agent from the antibody in the intracellular environment. The linker can be, e.g. a peptidyl linker that is cleaved by an intracellular peptidase or protease enzyme, including but not limited to a lysosomal or endosomal protease. Often the peptidyl linker is at least two amino acids long or at least three amino acids long. Cleaving agnets can include cathepsins and D and plasmin, all of which are known to hydrolyze dipeptide drug derivative s resulting in the release of active drug inside target cells (see \nDubowchik and Walker, 1999 Pharm. Therapuetics 83:67-123\n). Other linkers are described e.g. in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,214,345\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLinkers can be pH-sensitive can often be hydrolizable under acidic conditions such as is found in the lysosome (see e.g. \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,122,368\n \n; \n \n5,824,805\n \n; \n \n5,622,929\n \n; \nDubowchik and Walker, 1999 Pharm. Therapuetics 83:G7-123\n; \nNeville et al., 1989 BIol. Chem. 264:14653-14661\n). Such linkers are relatively stable under neutral pH conditions, such as those in the blood, but are unstable at below pH 5.5 or 5.0, the pH of the lysosome. Linkers can be cleavable under reducing conditions (e.g. a disulfide linker) (see e.g., \nThorpe et al., 1987 Cancer Res. 47:5924-5931\n; \nWawrzynczak et al., In Immunnoconjugates: Antibody Conjugates in Radioimmagery and Therapy of Cancer, C.W.Vogel ed, Oxford U. Press, 1987\n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,880,935\n \n). The linker can be a malonate linker (\nJohnson et al., 1995, Anticancer Res. 15:1387-93\n), a maleimidobenzoly linker (\nlau et al., 1995, Bioorg-Med-Chem. 3(10):1299-1304\n or a 3'-N-amide analog (Lau \net al.,\n 1995, Bioorg-Med-Chem.3(10):1305-1312).\n\n\n \n\n\nProphylactic and Therapeutic Uses of the Present Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the invention can act as either agonists or antagonists of GPNMB, depending on the methods of their use. The antibodies can be used to prevent, diagnose, or treat medical disorders in a subject, especially in humans. Antibodies of the invention can also be used for isolating GPNMB or GPNMB-expressing cells. Furthermore, the antibodies can be used to treat a subject at risk of or susceptible to a disorder or having a disorder associated with aberrant GPNMB expression or function. Antibodies of the invention can be used to detect GPNMB in such subjects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods for treating and/or preventing a disease or disorder associated with overexpression of GPNMB and/or cell hyperproliferative disorders, particularly cancer, in a subject comprising administering an effective amount of a composition that can target cells expressing GPNMB, and inhibiting the GPNMB expression or function, and/or having therapeutic or prophylactic effects on the hyperproliferative cell disease. In one embodiment, the method of the invention comprises administering to a subject a composition comprising an immunoconjugate that comprises an antibody of the invention and a cytotoxic agent against the hyperproliferative cell disease. In another embodiment, the method of the invention comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a composition comprising a naked IgG2 antibody of the invention and one or more immunomodulators. In yet another embodiment, the method of the invention comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a composition comprosing a single chain Fv antibody (anti-GPNMB) conjugated to a cytotoxic agent, or a composition comprising a bispecific antibody that have a single chain anti-GPNMB antibody component and a anti-CD3 antibody component. In a preferred embodiment, the hyperproliferative cell disease is cancer. More preferably, the cancer is melanoma, or a cancer of the CNS system, such as astrocytoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, or neoplastic meningitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides therapies comprising administering one of more antibodies of the invention and compositions comprising said antibodies to a subject, preferably a human subject, for preventing and/or treating a disorder characterized by or associated with aberrant expression and/or activity of GPNMB or a symptom thereof. In one embodiment, the invention provides a method of preventing or treating a disorder characterized by or associated with aberrant expression and/or activity of GPNMB or a symptom thereof, said method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of one or more antibodies of the invention. In certain embodiments, an effective amount of one or more immunoconjugates comprising one or more antibodies of the invention is administered to a subject in need thereof to prevent or treat a disorder characterized by or associated with aberrant expression and/or activity of GPNMB or a symptom thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides methods of preventing or treating a disorder characterized by or associated with aberrant expression and/or activity of GPNMB or a symptom thereof, said methods comprising administering to a subject in need thereof one or more of the antibodies of the invention and one or more therapies (e.g., one or more prophylactic or therapeutic agents) other than antibodies of the invention. The prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the combination therapies of the invention can be administered sequentially or concurrently. In a specific embodiment, the combination therapies of the invention comprise an effective amount of one or more antibodies of the invention and an effective amount of at least one other therapy (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agent) which has a different mechanism of action than said antibodies. In certain embodiments, the combination therapies of the present invention improve the prophylactic or therapeutic effect of one or more antibodies of the invention by functioning together with the antibodies to have an additive or synergistic effect. In certain embodiments, the combination therapies of the present invention reduce the side effects associated with the therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the combination therapies can be administered to a subject, preferably a human subject, in the same pharmaceutical composition. Alternatively, the prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the combination therapies can be administered concurrently to a subject in separate pharmaceutical compositions. The prophylactic or therapeutic agents may be administered to a subject by the same or different routes of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, a phamaceutical composition comprising one or more antibodies of the invention described herein is administered to a subject, preferably a human, to prevent and/or treat a disorder characterized by or associated with aberrant expression and/or activity of GPNMB or a symptom thereof. In accordance with the invention, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also comprise one or more therapies (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agents), other than antibodies of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the invention may also be used to detect the presence of GPNMB in biological samples (in diagnostic methods or use as an efficacy marker). The amount of GPNMB detected may be correlated with the expression level of GPNMB, which, in turn, is correlated with the disease, tumor type, tumor burden or stage using methods known in the art (see for example recommendations of the AAPS Ligand Binding Assay Bioanalytical Focus Group (LBABFG) \nPharm Res. 2003 Nov;20(11):1885-900\n \n).\n Detection methods that employ antibodies are well known in the art and include, for example, ELISA, radioimmunoassay, immunoblot, Western blot, IHC, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation. The antibodies may be provided in a diagnostic kit that incorporates one or more of these techniques to detect GPNMB. Such a kit may contain other components, packaging, instructions, or other material to aid the detection of the protein. In a specific embodiment, the antibodies of the invention are conjugated to a radioactive isotope, and are injected to a subject to detect cells that overexpressing GPNMB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the antibodies are intended for diagnostic purposes, it may be desirable to modify them, for example, with a ligand group (such as biotin) or a detectable marker group (such as a fluorescent group, a radioisotope or an enzyme). If desired, the antibodies of the invention may be labeled using conventional techniques. Suitable detectable labels include, for example, fluorophores, chromophores, radioactive atoms, electron-dense reagents, enzymes, and ligands having specific binding partners. Enzymes are typically detected by their activity. For example, horseradish peroxidase can be detected by its ability to convert tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a blue pigment, quantifiable with a spectrophotometer. For detection, suitable binding partners include, but are not limited to, biotin and avidin or streptavidin, IgG and protein A, and the numerous receptor-ligand couples known in the art. Other permutations and possibilities will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, and are considered as equivalents within the scope of the instant invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the invention can be used in screening methods to identify inhibitors of GPNMB effective as therapeutics. In such a screening assay, a first binding mixture is formed by combining GPNMB and an antibody of the invention; and the amount of binding in the first binding mixture (M\n0\n) is measured. A second binding mixture is also formed by combining GPNMB, the antibody, and the compound or agent to be screened, and the amount of binding in the second binding mixture (M\n1\n) is measured. A compound to be tested may be another anti-GPNMB antibody. The amounts of binding in the first and second binding mixtures are then compared, for example, by calculating the M\n1\n/M\n0\n ratio. The compound or agent is considered to be capable of modulating a GPNMB-associated responses if a decrease in binding in the second binding mixture as compared to the first binding mixture is observed. The formulation and optimization of binding mixtures is within the level of skill in the art, such binding mixtures may also contain buffers and salts necessary to enhance or to optimize binding, and additional control assays may be included in the screening assay of the invention. Compounds found to reduce the GPNMB-antibody binding by at least about 10% \n(i.e.,\n M\n1\n/M \n0<0\n.\n9\n), preferably greater than about 30% may thus be identified and then, if desired, secondarily screened for the capacity to ameliorate a disorder in other assays or animal models as described below. The strength of the binding between GPNMB and an antibody can be measured using, for example, an enzyme-linked innnunoadsorption assay (ELISA), radio-immunoassay (RIA), surface plasmon resonance-based technology (e.g., Biacore), all of which are techniques well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound may then be tested in vitro as described in the Examples, \ninfra.\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDosage and Frequency of Administration\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe amount of a prophylactic or therapeutic agent or a composition of the invention which will be effective in the prevention and/or treatment of a disorder associated with or characterized by aberrant expression and/or activity of GPNMB can be determined by standard clinical methods. For example, the dosage of the composition which will be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of cancer can be determined by administering the composition to an animal model. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. Preliminary doses as, for example, determined according to animal tests, and the scaling of dosages for human administration is performed according to art-accepted practices. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals. The data obtained from the cell culture assays or animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. Therapeutically effective dosages achieved in one animal model can be converted for use in another animal, including humans, using conversion factors known in the art \n(see, e.g.,\n \nFreireich et al. (1966) Cancer Chemother. Reports, 50(4): 219-244\n \n).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelection of the preferred effective dose can be determined (e.g., via clinical trials) by a skilled artisan based upon the consideration of several factors which will be known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such factors include the disease to be treated or prevented, the symptoms involved, the patient's body mass, gender, immune status and other factors known by the skilled artisan to reflect the accuracy of administered pharmaceutical compositions. Suitable regimens can be selected by one skilled in the art by considering such factors and by following, for example, dosages reported in literature and recommended in the \nPhysician's Desk Reference (59th ed., 2005\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe precise dose to be employed in the formulation, will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the cancer, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor other cancer therapeutic agents administered to a patient, the typical doses of various cancer therapeutics are known in the art. Given the invention, certain preferred embodiments will encompass the administration of lower dosages in combination treatment regimens than dosages recommended for the administration of single agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the dosage of an antibody or an immunoconjugate comprising an antibody of the invention administered to prevent and/or treat a disorder associated with or characterized by aberrant expression and/or activity of GPNMB (e.g., cancer) in a patient is 30 mg/kg or less, 25 mg/kg or less, 20 mg/kg or less, 15 mg/kg or less, preferably 12 mg/kg or less, 11 mg/kg or less, 10 mg/kg or less, 9 mg/kg or less, 8 mg/kg or less, 7 mg/kg or less, 6 mg/kg or less, 5 mg/kg or less, 4 mg/kg or less, 3 mg/kg or less, 2 mg/kg or less, or 1 mg/kg or less of a patient's body weight.

Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first therapy (e.g., a first prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time, followed by the administration of a second therapy (e.g., a second prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time, optionally, followed by the administration of a third therapy (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic agent) for a period of time and so forth, and repeating this sequential administration, i.e., the cycle in order to reduce the development of resistance to one of the therapies, to avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies, and/or to improve the efficacy of the therapies.\n\n\n \n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Administration\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe disclosure provides compositions comprising anti-GPNMB antibodies. Such compositions may be suitable for pharmaceutical use and administration to patients. The compositions typically comprise one or more antibodies of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The phrase \"phannaceutically acceptable excipient\" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial agents and antifungal agents, isotonic agents, and absorption delaying agents, and the like, that are compatible with pharmaceutical administration. The use of such media and agents for phannaceutically active substances is well known in the art. The compositions may also contain other active compounds providing supplemental, additional, or enhanced therapeutic functions. The pharmaceutical compositions may also be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Methods to accomplish the administration are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. The administration may, for example, be intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intracavity, subcutaneous or transdermal. It may also be possible to obtain compositions which may be topically or orally administered, or which may be capable of transmission across mucous membranes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolutions or suspensions used for intradermal or subcutaneous application typically include one or more of the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerin, propylene glycol, or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates; and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. Such preparations may be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for injection include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars; polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, and sodium chloride in the composition. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and/or by the use of surfactants. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate, and gelatin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For oral administration, the antibodies can be combined with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches, and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature; a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSystemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration may be accomplished, for example, through the use of lozenges, nasal sprays, inhalers, or suppositories. For example, in case of antibodies that comprise the Fc portion, compositions may be capable of transmission across mucous membranes in intestine, mouth, or lungs \n(e.g.,\n via the FcRn receptor-mediated pathway as described in \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 6,030,613\n \n). For transdermal administration, the active compounds may be formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. For administration by inhalation, the antibodies may be delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser, which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the presently disclosed antibodies are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Liposomal suspensions containing the presently disclosed antibodies can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may be advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in a dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The term \"dosage unit form\" as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the composition of the invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD\n50\n (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED\n50\n (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD\n50\n/ED\n50\n. Compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor any composition used in the present invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. Examples of suitable bioassays include DNA replication assays, clonogenic assays and other assays as, for example, described in the Examples. The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC\n50\n \n(i.e.,\n the concentration of the antibody which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms). Circulating levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a suitable bioassay. The dosage lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies can be modified to become immunotoxins utilizing techniques that are well known in the art \n(\n \nVitetta 1993, Immunol Today 14: 252\n \n;\n \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,194,594\n \n \n).\n Cyotoxic immunoconjugates are known in the art and have been used as therapeutic agents.

A solution was injected beneath the skin without piercing the muscle tissue by using an \ninsulin\n 1/2 mL syringe with attached 28 or 30 \ngauge x\n 1/2\" needle. The mouse to be injected was grasped by the loose fur along its neck and back so that it was immobilized and was turned over so the ventral side was accessible. The hind limb of the mouse was grasped and the needle was inserted (bevel side up) at the ankle, threading just under the skin until the needle tip reached the paw. The needle was inserted along the outside length of the hind foot carefully, to avoid the vein located towards the inner side of the foot. Once the tip of the needle reached the paw, the solution was injected slowly until resistance was felt or the designated volume had been dispensed. The needle was then withdrawn and the second hind foot injected in the same manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following Table 4 provides the immunization schedule for the 2 groups of mice.\n\n \n \nTable 4:lmmunization Schedule of GPNMB Antigen: GPNMB-soluble at 043mg/mL\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTarget\n \nGroup No.\n \nMode of imunization\n \n \n \nNo. of mice\n \nAntigen\n \n1st injection\n \n \n2nd boost\n \n \n \n \n \nGPNMB\n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n \nFootpad\n \n \n \n \n \n \n10\n \nGPNMB-soluble\n \n10ug/mouse\n \n5ug/mouse\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlum Gel\n \n \nAlum Gel\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDay\n \n \n \n 0\n \n \nDay\n 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3rd boost\n \n4th boost\n \n5th boost\n \n6th boost\n \nBleed\n \n7th boost\n \n8th boost\n \nFusion\n \n \n \n \n \n5ug/mouse\n \n5ug/mouse\n \n5ug/mouse\n \n5ug/mouse\n \n \n \n5ug/mouse\n \n10ug/mouse\n \n \n \n \n \nAlum Gel\n \nAlum Gel\n \nAlum Gel\n \nAlum Gel\n \n \n \nTitermax Gold\n \nD-\nPBS\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDay\n \n \n \n 6\n \n \nDay\n 10\n \n \nDay\n 14\n \n \nDay\n 17\n \n \nDay\n 21\n \n \nDay\n 23\n \nDay 27\n \n \nDay\n 31\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTarget\n \ngroup#\n \nMode of Immunization\n \nImmunization\n \n \n \n# mice\n \nAntigen\n \n1st injection\n \n \n2nd boost\n \n \n \n \n \nGPNMB\n \n \n \n \n \n2\n \n \nFootpad\n \n \n \n \n \n \n10\n \nGPNMB\n-\nsoluble\n \n10ug/mouse\n \n5ug/mouse\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlum Gel\n \n \nAlum Gel\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDay\n \n \n \n 0\n \n \nDay\n 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3rd boost\n \n4th boost\n \n5th boost\n \n6th boost\n \nBleed\n \n7th boost\n \n8th boost\n \n9th boost\n \nFusion\n \n \n \n \n5ug/mouse\n \n5ug/mouse\n \n5ug/mouse\n \n5ug/mouse\n \n \n \n5ug/mouse\n \n10ug/mouse\n \n10ug/mouse\n \n \n \n \n \nAlum Gel\n \nTitermax Gold\n \nAlum Gel\n \nAlum Gel\n \n \n \nAlum Gel\n \nD-PBS\n \nD-\nPBS\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDay\n \n \n \n 7\n \nDay 11\n \n \nDay\n 14\n \n \nDay\n 17\n \n \nDay\n 21\n \nDay 22\n \n \nDay\n 25\n \n \nDay\n 100\n \nDav 104\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nSelection of animals for harvest by titer\n\n\n \n \n \nAnti- GPNMB antibody titers in the serum from immunized XenoMouse® mice were determined by ELISA. Briefly, three sets of ELISAs were set up. GPNMB (+NMB) at 1 µg/mL, GPNMB(-NMB) at 1 µg/mL, and NMB at 1 µg/mL were coated onto Costar Labcoat Universal Binding Polystyrene 96-well plates (Coming, Acton, MA) overnight at 4°C in Antigen Coating Buffer (0.1 M Carbonate Buffer, pH 9.6 NaHC0\n3\n (MW 84) 8.4 g/L). The next day, the plates were washed three times with washing buffer (0.05\n% Tween\n 20 in 1x PBS) using a Biotek plate washer. The plates were then blocked with 200 ul/well blocking buffer (0.5% BSA, 0.1\n% Tween\n 20, 0.01% Thimerosal in 1x PBS) and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After the one-hour blocking, the plates were washed three times with washing buffer using a Biotek plate washer. Sera from either GPNMB immunized XenoMouse®mice or naive XenoMouse® animals were titrated in 0.5% BSA/PBS buffer at 1:3 dilutions in duplicate from a 1:100 initial dilution. The last well was left blank. These plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 h, and the plates were then washed three times with washing buffer using a Biotek plate washer. A goat anti-human IgG Fc-specific horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Pierce, Rockford, IL) conjugated antibody was added at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed three times with washing buffer using a Biotek plate washer. After washing, the plates were developed with the addition of TMB chromogenic substrate (BioFx BSTP-0100-01) for 10-20 min or until negative control wells start to show color. Then the ELISA was stopped by the addition of Stop Solution (650 nM Stop reagent for TMB (BioFx BSTP-0100-01), reconstituted with 100 mL H\n2\nO per bottle). The specific titer of each XenoMouse° animal was determined from the optical density at 650 nm and is shown in Tables 2 and 3 below. The titer value is the reciprocal of the greatest dilution of sera with an OD reading two-fold that of background. Therefore, the higher the number, the greater was the humoral immune response to GPNMB.

Pooled sera were tested at 1:10, 1:100 and 1:500 compared to Anti- IL13 serum (control) and prebleeds diluted at 1:10, 1:100 (control).\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 3: Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHybridoma cell lines were generated from immunized mice demonstrated to have anti-GPNMB titers using standard techniques (see \nMendez et al, 1997, Nat Genet. 15:146-156\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunized mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the lymph nodes were harvested and pooled from each cohort. The lymphoid cells were dissociated by grinding in DMEM to release the cells from the tissues, and the cells were suspended in DMEM. The cells were counted, and 0.9 mL DMEM per 100 million lymphocytes was added to the cell pellet to resuspend the cells gently but completely. Using 100 µl of CD90+ magnetic beads per 100 million cells, the cells were labeled by incubating the cells with the magnetic beads at 4°C for 15 minutes. The magnetically-labeled cell suspension containing up to 10\n8\n positive cells (or up to 2x10\n9\n total cells) was loaded onto a LS+ column and the column washed with DMEM. The total effluent was collected as the CD90-negative fraction (most of these cells were expected to be B cells).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fusion was performed by mixing washed enriched B cells from above and nonsecretory myeloma P3X63Ag8.653 cells purchased from ATCC, cat.# CRL 1580 (\nKearney et al, J. Immunol. 123, 1979, 1548-1550\n) at a ratio of 1:1. The cell mixture was gently pelleted by centrifugation at 800 g. After complete removal of the supernatant, the cells were treated with 2-4 mL of Pronase solution (CalBiochem, cat. # 53702; 0.5 mg/mL in PBS) for no more than 2 minutes. Then 3-5 mL of FBS was added to stop the enzyme activity and the suspension was adjusted to 40 mL total volume using electro cell fusion solution, ECFS (0.3 M Sucrose, Sigma, Cat# S7903, 0.1 mM Magnesium Acetate, Sigma, Cat# M2545, 0.1 mM Calcium Acetate, Sigma, Cat# C4705). The supernatant was removed after centrifugation and the cells were resuspended in 40 mL ECFS. This wash step was repeated and the cells again were resuspended in ECFS to a concentration of 2x10\n6\n cells/mL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElectro-cell fusion was performed using a fusion generator, model ECM2001, Genetronic, Inc., San Diego, CA. The fusion chamber size used was 2.0 mL, using the Abgenix, Inc. optimum instrument settings to do ECF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter ECF, the cell suspensions were carefully removed from the fusion chamber under sterile conditions and transferred into a sterile tube containing the same volume of Hybridoma Culture Medium (DMEM (JRH Biosciences), 15% FBS (Hyclone), supplemented with L-glutamine, pen/strep, OPI (oxaloacetate, pyruvate, bovine insulin) (all from Sigma) and IL-6 (Boehringer Mannheim)). The cells were incubated for 15-30 minutes at 37°C, and then centrifuged at 400 g (1000 rpm [but in what rotor? Otherwise, leave out the rpm]) for five minutes. The cells were gently resuspended in a small volume of Hybridoma Selection Medium (Hybridoma Culture Medium supplemented with 0.5x HA (Sigma, cat. # A9666)), and the volume was adjusted appropriately with more Hybridoma Selection Medium, based on a final plating of 5x10\n6\n B cells total per 96-well plate and 200 µL per well. The cells were mixed gently and pipetted into 96-well plates and allowed to grow. On \n \nday\n \n 7 or 10, one-half the medium was removed, and the cells were re-fed with Hybridoma Selection Medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter 14 days of culture, hybridoma supernatants were screened for GPNMB specific monoclonal antibodies. In the Primary screen, the ELISA plates (Fisher, Cat. No. 12-565-136) were coated with 50 µL/well of GPNMB (1 µg/mL) in Coating Buffer (0.1 M Carbonate Buffer, pH 9.6, NaHC0\n3\n 8.4 g/L), then incubated at 4°C overnight. After incubation, the plates were washed with Washing Buffer (0.05\n% Tween\n 20 in PBS) three times. 200 µL/well Blocking Buffer (0.5% BSA, 0.1\n% Tween\n 20, 0.01% Thimerosal in 1x PBS) were added and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After incubation, the plates were washed with Washing Buffer three times. Aliquots (50 uL/well) of hybridoma supernatants and positive and negative controls were added, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The positive control used throughout was serum from the relevant GPNMB immunized XenoMouse® mouse and the negative control was serum from the KLH-immunized relevant strain of XenoMouse® mouse. After incubation, the plates were washed three times with Washing Buffer. 100 µL/well of detection antibody goat anti-huIgGfc-HRP (Caltag, Cat. No. H10507, using concentration was 1:2000 dilution) was added and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After incubation, the plates were washed three times with Washing Buffer. 100 µl/well of TMB (BioFX Lab. Cat. No. TMSK-0100-01) was added, and the plates were allowed to develop for about 10 minutes (until negative control wells barely started to show color). 50 µl/well stop solution (TMB Stop Solution (BioFX Lab. Cat. No. STPR-0100-01) was then added and the plates were read on an ELISA plate reader at a wavelength of 450 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe old culture supernatants from the positive hybridoma cells growth wells based on primary screen were removed completely and the IL-lb positive hybridoma cells were suspended with fresh hybridoma culture medium and were transferred to 24-well plates. After 2 days in culture, these supernatants were ready for a secondary confirmation screen. In the secondary confirmation screen, the positives in the first screening were screened in GPNMB binding ELISA described as above, and two sets of detective system for the secondary confirmation ELISA, one set for hIgG detection, one set for human Ig kappa light chain detection (goat anti-hlg kappa-HRP, Southern Biotechnology, Cat. No. 2060-05) in order to demonstrate fully human composition for both heavy and light chains. The two sets of ELISA procedures were identical to the descriptions above except the three different detection antibodies were used separately. All positive hits from the secondary confirmation ELISA assay were counter screened for binding to immunogen by ELISA in order to exclude those that cross-react with IL-la. The ELISA plates (Fisher, Cat. No. 12-565-136) were coated with 50 µL/well of irrelevant V5His-fusion protein, lug/mL in Coating Buffer (0.1 M Carbonate Buffer, pH 9.6, NaHCO\n3\n 8.4 g/L), then incubated at 4°C overnight. The remaining procedures were identical to the descriptions above.

A 1:25 dilution of cell supernatant was passed over a protein A surface for 5 min followed by washing the surface for 10 mins. Subsequently, GPNMB was injected for 90 sec. over the surface at a concentration of 880 nM followed by dissociation. Double-referenced binding data were obtained by subtracting the signal from a control flow cell and subtracting the baseline drift of a buffer injected just prior to the antigen injection. GPNMB binding ddata for each mAb was normalized for the amount of mAb captured on each surface. Normalized, drift corrected responses were also measured. The sensorgrams were fit to a simple 1:1 kinetic model. The results are shown in Table 7. Sixteen of the cell supernatants contained mAb that significantly bound to GPNMB and three Mabs, 15.1, 15.2, and 15.3 showed strong binding to GPNMB.\n\n \nTable 7\n \n \n \n \nSample\n \n \n \nKd (nM)\n \n \n \nka (M-1s-1 )\n \n \n \nkd (s-1 )\n \n \n \nExpression Level\n \n \n \n \n \n15.1\n \n52\n \n16524\n \n8.55 E-04\n \nmedium\n \n \n \n15.3\n \n59\n \n13417\n \n7.97E-04\n \nmedium\n \n \n \n15.2\n \n61\n \n12635\n \n7.70E-04\n \nhigh\n \n \n \n2.2\n \n96\n \n9257\n \n8.90E-04\n \nmedium\n \n \n \n10.2\n \n118\n \n3955\n \n4.66E-04\n \nlow\n \n \n \n7.3\n \n121\n \n9648\n \n1.17E-03\n \nmedium\n \n \n \n7.1\n \n122\n \n11842\n \n1.44 E-03\n \nmedium\n \n \n \n7.2\n \n141\n \n9356\n \n1.32E-03\n \nhigh\n \n \n \n10.3\n \n147\n \n3626\n \n5.32E-04\n \nlow\n \n \n \n10.1\n \n209\n \n4235\n \n8.85E-04\n \nlow\n \n \n \n8.2\n \n242\n \n7555\n \n1.83E-03\n \nmedium\n \n \n \n8.3\n \n264\n \n6551\n \n1.73E-03\n \nlow\n \n \n \n8.1\n \n329\n \n6830\n \n2.25E-03\n \nmedium\n \n \n \n12.3\n \n407\n \n1549\n \n6.31 E-04\n \nmedium\n \n \n \n12.2\n \n435\n \n1280\n \n5.57E-04\n \nmedium\n \n \n \n12.1\n \n630\n \n1587\n \n1.00E-03\n \nlow\n \n \n \n1.1\n \n1000\n \n<1500\n \nnd\n \nhigh\n \n \n \n1.2\n \n>1000\n \n<1500\n \nnd\n \nhigh\n \n \n \n1.3\n \n>1000\n \n<1500\n \nnd\n \nmedium\n \n \n \n2.1\n \n>1000\n \n<1500\n \nnd\n \nmedium\n \n \n \n5.1\n \n>1000\n \n<1500\n \nnd\n \nmedium\n \n \n \n5.2\n \n>1000\n \n<1500\n \nnd\n \nmedium\n \n \n \n5.3\n \n>1000\n \n<1500\n \nnd\n \nmedium\n \n \n \n9.1\n \n>1000\n \n<1500\n \nnd\n \nmedium\n \n \n \n9.2\n \n>1000\n \n<1500\n \nnd\n \nlow\n \n \n \n9.3\n \n1000\n \n<1500\n \nnd\n \nlow\n \n \n \n11.1\n \n>1000\n \n<1500\n \nnd\n \nlow\n \n \n \n11.2\n \n>1000\n \n<1500\n \nnd\n \nlow\n \n \n \n11.3\n \n>1000\n \n<1500\n \nnd\n \nlow\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 4: Binning of Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCertain antibodies, described herein were binned in accordance with the protocol described in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication No.20030157730\n \n. MxhIgG conjugated beads are prepared for coupling to primary antibody. The volume of supernatant needed is calculated using the following formula: (n+10) x 50µL (where n = total number of samples on plate). Where the concentration is known, 0.5µg/mL is used. Bead stock is gently vortexed, then diluted in supernatant to a concentration of 2500 of each bead per well or 0.5X10\n5\n /mL and incubated on a shaker in the dark at RT overnight, or 2 hours if at a known concentration of 0.5 µLg/mL. Following aspiration, 50 µL of each bead is added to each well of filter plate, then washed once by adding 100 µL/well wash buffer and aspirating. Antigen and controls are added to filter plate 50uL/well then covered and allowed to incubate in the dark for 1 hour on shaker. Following a wash step, a secondary unknown antibody is added at 50µL/well using the same dilution (or concentration if known) as is used for the primary antibody. The plates are then incubated in the dark for 2 hours at RT on shaker followed by a wash step. Next, 50µL/well biotinylated mxhIgG diluted 1:500 is added and allowed to incubate in the dark for 1 hour on shaker at RT. Following a wash step, 50µL/well Streptavidin-PE is added at 1:1000 and allowed to incubate in the dark for 15 minutes on shaker at RT. Following a wash step, each well is resuspended in 80µL blocking buffer and read using Luminex. Results show that the monoclonal antibodies belong to distinct bins. Competitive binding by antibodies from different bins supports antibody specificity for similar or adjacent epitopes. Non competitive binding supports antibody specificity for unique epitopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree bins were created to further test the binding of six anti-GPNMB antibodies. \nBin\n 1 included GPNMB antibodies (1.2.1), (1.10.1), and (2.22.1). \nBin\n 2 included GPNMB antibodies (2.3.1) and (1.15.1), and \nBin\n 3 included GPNMB antibody (2.10.1).

and fixed tissue specimens. Tissue sections (5 µm) were cut from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue samples and were rehydrated through incubations in xylene and a graded ethanol series terminating in PBS. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched in a 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide in methanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTissue sections were blocked in blocking buffer (5% BSA (Sigma), 1% goat serum (Jackson Immunolabs, West Grove, PA) in PBS) for 1 hour. Primary and secondary antibodies were precomplexed in 5% BSA and 1% goat serum in PBS for 1 hour at 37° C at a molar ratio of approximately 10:1 of anti-GPNMB or control IgG to secondary biotinylated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunolabs). Complexes were blocked with a 1:2000 dilution of human serum and incubated again for 1 hour at 37° C. Tissue sections were incubated with anti-GPNMB antibody or isotype control antibody complexes diluted in blocking buffer for I hour. Sections were washed in 3 changes of PBS for 5 to 10 minutes each and incubated with a 1:200 dilution of streptavidin conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunolabs) in blocking buffer for 30 minutes and then washed as before. Antibody was detected using DAB reagent (Vector labs). Sections were counterstained in hematoxylin (Fisher Scientific) and dehydrated through alcohol and xylene and coverslipped with permount (Fisher Scientific).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-GPNMB Mabs 2.22.1 and 2.22.2 were used to stain normal and tumor human tissue microarrays (IMPATH, Los Angeles, CA). Positive staining was seen in lung, ovarian, renal, esophagus, and head & neck carcinomas, squamous cell carcinoma, melanomas and normal skin specimens. Melanoma and lung carcinomas showed the highest staining intensities with subcellular staining located in the membrane and cytoplasm.

A renal cancer cell line, TK10, which does not express GPNMB antigen was used as a negative control. Isotype matched antibody pK16.3 was used as a negative control. Cells were washed twice with PBS (Ca and Mg free), incubated with Versene at 37°C until cells detached, counted and aliquoted at 1 million cells per assay tube. Cells were then washed twice and resuspended in ice-cold FACS buffer (0.01M HEPES, 0.15M NaCl, 0.1% NaN\n3\n and 4% FBS). Primary antibody at 1 µg/mL was added to the cells. Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, washed 2-3 times and resuspended in 1 mL of ice-cold FACS buffer. R-PE-conjugated goat anti-human antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory) at 1:100 dilution was added and cells were incubated on ice for 30 min.

Supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, USA). Primary antibody was added to the cell lysates and incubated on ice for 3 hr followed by addition of Protein-G agarose (Amersham, USA) for 2 hr. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed, boiled in sample buffer and resolved by 4-20% gels. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Invitrogen, USA) and probed with anti-GPNMB antibody (0.5 µg/mL) followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-human antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory) at 1:4000 dilution. The immunocomplexes were detected with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham, USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWestern blot analysis showed anti-GPNMB antibodies immunoprecipitated GPNMB protein expressed in cell lysates of UACC-62, SK-Me15 and SK-Me12 cell lines. The results are in concurrence with the cell surface expression determined by FACS analysis.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 9: anti GPNMB Antibody mediated indirect cell killing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nUACC-62, a GPNMB antigen expressing cell line, and TK10, a non-expressing cell line were plated onto flat bottom 96-well tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at a density of 3000 cells per well. Once the cells reached ~25% confluency, 100 ng/well of secondary antibody-toxin conjugate (goat anti-human IgG-saporin; Advanced Targeting Systems, San Diego, USA, HUM-ZAP; cat. # IT-22) was added. Anti-GPNMB MAbs 2.10.2, 2.22.1, 1.15.1 or isotype control mAb (pK16.3) were added to each well at a final concentration of 10 or 50 ng/mL. An anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (MS-269-PABX, NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA, USA) was used as a positive primary antibody control. Chemotherapy reagent 5-FU at 600 uM was used as a positive reagent control. On \nday\n 5, the cells were trypsinized, transferred to 6-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37°C. Plates were examined daily and between 8-10 days, all plates were Giemsa stained and colonies were counted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe percent viability of GPNMB positive UACC-62 after treatment is shown in \nFigure 2\n. Chemotherapy reagent 5-FU induced a complete killing whereas addition of saporin toxin-conjugated secondary antibody alone or in combination with isotype control pK16.3 antibody had no effect on cell growth for both cell lines. Both UACC-62 and TK10 cell lines express EGFR protein and addition of EGFR specific antibody at 50 ng/mL and secondary antibody toxin conjugate resulted in a complete killing of UACC-62 and TK10 cells. At the same dose, all three GPNMB specific antibodies, 2.10.2, 2.22.1 and 1.15.1 induced over 70% killing of UACC-62 cells. Anti-GPNMB antibodies 2.10.2 and 2.22.1 induced less than 5% and 1.15.1 less than 24% cell death in GPNMB \nnegative TK10\n 0 cells.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 10: Cell killing by Auristatin-E (AE) Conjugated anti-GPNMB Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nUACC-62 and TK10 cells were plated onto flat bottom 96-well tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). On \nday\n 2 or cells reach ~25% confluency, various concentrations (1 to 1000 ng/mL) of unconjugated and Auristatin E-conjugated antibodies (Seattle Genetics, Bothell, WA, USA), including isotype control, EGFR (NeoMarkers MS-269-PABX, Fremont, CA, USA), 2.22.1 or 2.10.2, were added to cells. MAb 2.3.1 was chosen for the isotype control in this study because it does not bind to GPNMB expressing cells as demonstrated by FACS analysis. A monoclonal antibody generated against the EGF receptor was used to demonstrate specific killing mediated by AE-conjugated antibody. On \nday\n 5, the cells were trypsinized, transferred to 6-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37°C. Plates were examined daily. On days 8-10, all plates were Giemsa stained and colonies on the plates were counted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe percent viability in GPNMB positive UACC-62 cells and negative TK10 cells is presented in \nFigures 4 and 5\n, respectively. The results indicate that unconjugated and AE-conjugated 2.6.2 immunoconjugate had no effect on growth of both UACC-62 and TK10 cells. However, both UACC-62 and TK10 cell lines were susceptible to AE-EGFR immunoconjugate mediated cell killing in a dose-dependent fashion with over 95 % cell death at 1000 ng/mL. At the same dose, both 2.22.1-AE and 2.10.2-AE immunoconjugates induced approximately 75 % cell death of UACC-62 cells when compared to the isotype control. The cell killing response was dose dependent. GPNMB negative TK10 cell survival was not affected by 2.22.1-AE nor 2.10.2-AE immunoconjugates at the same dose range. These results demonstrate the specific and cytotoxic effects of AE conjugated anti-GPNMB antibodies on antigen expressing cells.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 11: Melanoma cells susceptible to MAb1.15.1-AE immunoconjugate killing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMelanoma cell lines were plated onto flat bottom 96-well tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). On \nday\n 2 or when cells reach ~25% confluency, various concentrations of unconjugated and Auristatin E-conjugated 1.15.1 were added to cells. MAb 2.6.2-AE was also used as a conjugated isotype control in this study. On \nday\n 5, the cells were trypsinized, transferred to 6-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37 °C.

Unconjugated 1.15.1 and AE-conjugated 2.6.2 had no effect on growth of all the melanoma cell lines tested. However, cell lines SK-Mel2, WM-266-4, G361, UACC-257, UACC-62, RPMI-7951 and SK-Mel5 were susceptible to 1.15.1-AE mediated killing in a dose-dependent fashion.

Animals were housed in specific pathogen-free conditions, according to the guidelines of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC International). Test animals were provided pelleted food and water \nad libitum\n and kept in a room with conditioned ventilation (HVAC), temperature (22° ± 2°C), relative humidity (55% ± 15%), and photoperiod (12 hr). All studies were carried out with approved institutional animal care and use protocols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nHuman Melanoma Xenograft Models.\n The tumor inhibitory activity of the CR011-MMAE immunoconjugate was measured in an anti-tumor xenograft model using athymic mice, according to published methods (see \nGeran et al., Cancer Chemother. Rep. 3:1-104 (1972\n)). Briefly, test animals were implanted subcutaneously by trocar with small fragments of a human melanoma (60-125 mg) excised from athymic mouse tumor donors. When tumors became established (10-20 days), the animals were pair-matched into groups (n= 6 mice/group), and treatment was administered by intravenous injection (tail vein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe SK-MEL-2 human melanoma (ATCC #HTB-68) was derived from a metastatic site (skin of thigh) of a 60 year old Caucasian male with malignant melanoma, and the SK-MEL-5 human melanoma (ATCC #HTB-70) was derived from a metastatic site (axillary lymph node) of a 24 year old Caucasian female with malignant melanoma (see \nFogh et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 59: 221-226 (1977\n)). Both cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effects of treatment were monitored by repetitive tumor measurements across 2 diameters with Vernier calipers; tumor size (in mg) was calculated using a standard formula, (W\n2\n x L)/2, assuming a specific gravity of 1.0. Tumor size and body weights were assessed twice weekly. Mice were examined daily, however, and moribund animals were humanely euthanized if clinical indications of excessive pain or distress were noted \n(i.e.,\n prostration, hunched posture, paralysis/paresis, distended abdomen, ulcerations, abscesses, seizures, and/or hemorrhages). Animals with tumors exceeding 2,000 mg were removed from the study and euthanized humanely.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nXenograft studies in the athymic mouse have been shown to effectively demonstrate anti-tumor effects for a variety of agents which have been shown subsequently to have activity against clinical cancer (\nJohnson et al., Br J Cancer 84:1424-1431 1 (2001\n)).\n\n\n \n\n\nResults:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-Tumor Effects \nin Vivo\n vs. SK-MEL-2 Melanoma.\n Based on the potency and cytotoxicity of CRO11-vcMMAE against GPNMB-expressing cells \nin vitro,\n the anti-tumor effects were examined \nin vivo.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effects of intravenous CRO11-vcMMAE treatment on the growth of subcutaneous human SK-MEL-2 melanoma are shown in \nFigure 1\n. After SK-MEL-2 tumor fragments were implanted and tumors became established (\nday\n 17, 61 mg), treatment commenced with intravenous administration of: CRO11-vcMMAE (0.625 - 20 mg/kg i.v., every 4 days for a total of 4 treatments \n(i.e.,\n q4d X4); saline and phosphate-buffered saline controls (i.v., q4d X4); and two known anti-tumor reference agents, vinblastine sulfate (i.v., 1.7 mg/kg, q4d X4) and paclitaxel (i.v., 24 mg/kg, q2d X4). The reference agents were administered at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determined in prior studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumors in animals treated with saline or PBS grew progressively until the tumor mass reached 2,000 mg at which time the animals were removed from the study and euthanized humanely. SK-MEL-2 tumors have a high \"take\" rate in immunocompromised hosts (97 %) and a low rate of spontaneous regression (3 %) \n(\n \nDykes et al., Development of human tumor xenograft models for in vivo evaluation of new antitumor drugs, in Immunodeficient mice in Oncology, vol. 42 (Fiebig HH and Berger DPe eds) pp 1-22, Contrib. Oncol. Basel, Karger (1992\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVinblastine produced a very slight, but not significant, anti-tumor effect (P ≤ 0.20); in this and other tumor models (e.g., SK-MEL-5) vinblastine produces noticeable tumor growth inhibition, but which is only occasionally significant. Paclitaxel, however, showed significant tumor growth inhibition and tumor stasis \n(i.e.,\n 100% growth inhibition) for approximately 2 weeks after treatment commenced (P ≤ 0.0077).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-tumor effects of CRO11-vcMMAE administered i.v. to SK-MEL-2-bearing mice were remarkable. At 20, 10, 5 or 2.5 mg/kg tumors rapidly diminished in size for the majority of the test animals; significant treatment effects were noted as early as 4 days after treatment commenced (P ≤ 0.014). Tumors that regressed completely did not re-grow during the \nobservation period\n 200 days).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe animals in this study showed no abnormal treatment effects on gross examination. Twice weekly body weight determinations showed no observable or statistically significant effects of treatment with CR011-vcMMAE on body weight or weight gain.\n\n\n \n\n\nConclusions:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCR011-vcMMAE produces substantial, dose-dependent and reproducible anti-tumor effects that begin as tumor growth inhibition but soon lead to complete regression of established human melanoma xenografts; the regressions are long-lived and re-growth of tumors after successful therapy has not been observed.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 14: Sequencing of Antibodies and their Corresponding DNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSequences of human GPNMB mAbs-derived heavy and kappa chain transcripts from hybridomas were obtained by direct sequencing of PCR products generated from poly(A\n+\n) RNA. PCR products were also cloned into pCRII using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and both strands were sequenced using Prism dye-terminator sequencing kits and an ABI 377 sequencing instrument. Each PCR reaction used a mixture of 5' sense primers which are provided in Table 17 below.\n\n \n \nTable 17:\n Primers Used\n \n \nVH\n \ncacc\n \nATG GAC TGG(C) ACC TGG AGG ATC\n \nSEQ ID NO: 290\n

as a Diagnostic Agent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nDetection of GPNMB antigen in a sample:\n\n \n \n \nThe following is a protocol for an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the detection of GPNMB antigen in a sample. In the assay, wells of a microtiter plate, such as a 96-well microtiter plate or a 384-well microtiter plate, are adsorbed for several hours with a first fully human monoclonal antibody directed against GPNMB. The immobilized antibody serves as a capture antibody for any of the GPNMB that may be present in a test sample. The wells are rinsed and treated with a blocking agent such as milk protein or albumin to prevent nonspecific adsorption of the analyte.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nSubsequently the wells are treated with a test sample suspected of containing the GPNMB antigen, or with a solution containing a standard amount of GPNMB antigen. Such a sample may be, for example, a serum sample from a subject suspected of having levels of circulating GPNMB considered to be diagnostic of a pathology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter rinsing away the test sample or standard, the wells are treated with a second fully human monoclonal anti-GPNMB antibody that is labeled by conjugation with biotin. The labeled anti-GPNMB antibody serves as a detecting antibody. After rinsing away excess second antibody, the wells are treated with avidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and a suitable chromogenic substrate. The concentration of the antigen in the test samples is determined by comparison with a standard curve developed from the standard samples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis ELISA assay provides a highly specific and very sensitive assay for the detection of the GPNMB antigen in a test sample.\n\n\n \n\n\nDetermination of GPNMB antigen concentration in patients:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA sandwich ELISA can also be used to quantify GPNMB levels in human serum. The 2 fully human monoclonal anti-GPNMB antibodies used in the sandwich ELISA, recognize different epitopes on the GPNMB molecule. The ELISA is performed as follows: 50 µ1 of capture anti-GPNMB antibody in coating buffer (0.1 M NaHC0\n3\n, pH 9.6) at a concentration of 2 µg/mL is coated on ELISA plates (Fisher). After incubation at 4°C overnight, the plates are treated with 200 µ1 of blocking buffer (0.5% BSA, 0.1 \n% Tween\n 20, 0.01% Thimerosal in PBS) for 1 hr at 25°C. The plates are washed (3x) using 0.05\n% Tween\n 20 in PBS (washing buffer, WB). Normal or patient sera (Clinomics, Bioreclaimation) are diluted in blocking buffer containing 50% human serum. The plates are incubated with serum samples overnight at 4°C, washed with WB, and then incubated with 100 µ1/well of biotinylated detection anti-GPNMB antibody for 1 hr at 25°C. After washing, the plates are incubated with HRP-Streptavidin for 15 min, washed as before, and then treated with 100 µl/well of o-phenylenediamine in H\n2\nO\n2\n (Sigma developing solution) for color generation. The reaction is stopped with 50 µ1/well of H\n2\nSO\n4\n (2M) and analyzed using an ELISA plate reader at 492 nm. Concentration of GPNMB antigen in serum samples is calculated by comparison to dilutions of purified GPNMB antigen using a four parameter curve fitting program.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStaging of cancer in a patient:\n\n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that based on the results set forth and discussed in the above diagnostic examples, it is possible to stage a cancer in a subject based on expression levels of the GPNMB antigen. For a given type of cancer (e.g., melanoma), samples of blood are taken from subjects diagnosed as being at various stages in the progression of the disease, and/or at various points in the therapeutic treatment of the cancer. The concentration of the GPNMB antigen present in the blood samples is determined using a method that specifically determines the amount of the antigen that is present. Such a method includes an ELISA method, such as the method described in the previous diagnostic examples. Using a population of samples that provides statistically significant results for each stage of progression or therapy, a range of concentrations of the antigen that may be considered characteristic of each stage is designated.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to stage the progression of the cancer in a subject under study, or to characterize the response of the subject to a course of therapy, a sample of blood is taken from the subject and the concentration of the GPNMB antigen present in the sample is determined. The concentration so obtained is used to identify in which range of concentrations the value falls. The range so identified correlates with a stage of progression or a stage of therapy identified in the various populations of diagnosed subjects, thereby providing a stage in the subject under study.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 17: Diagnosing Cancer With Antibodies Against GPNMB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA subject suspected of having an ovarian cancer tumor is identified and a tissue sample from the suspected tumor is removed for testing. The removed tissue is then contacted with anti-GPNMB antibodies having a colorimetric label. A determination is made of whether the anti-GPNMB antibodies bind specifically to the removed tissue. Binding is indicative of cancereous tissue while the absense of binding is indicative of non-cancerous tissue. The patient's conditition is diagnosed accordingly to facilitate subsequent testing, counseling, and/or treatment.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 18: Treating Cancer With Antibodies Against GPNMB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTargeting GPNMB on tumor cells is useful to treat a subject at risk for or afflicted with cancer. Such a subject would benefit from treatment with an anti-GPNMB antibody of the present invention. Typically, antibodies are administered in an outpatient setting by weekly administration at about 0.1-1.0 mg/kg dose by slow intravenous (IV) infusion. The appropriate therapeutically effective dose of an antibody is selected by a treating clinician and would range approximately from 1 \nµ\ng/kg to 20mg /kg, from 1 \nµ\ng/kg to 10 mg/kg, from 1 \nµ\ng/kg to 1mg/kg, from 10 \nµ\ng/kg to 1 mg/kg, from 10 \nµ\ng/kg to 100 \nµ\ng/kg, from 100 \nµ\ng/kg to 1 mg/kg, and from 500 \nµ\ng/kg to 5 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies are also used to prevent and/or to reduce severity and/or symptoms of disease associated with GPNMB-related disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test the clinical efficacy of antibodies in humans, individuals with cancer, particularly, but not limited to ovarian, lung or colon carcinoma are identified and randomized into treatment groups. Treatment groups include a group not receiving antibody treatment and groups treated with different doses of anti-GPNMB antibody. Individuals are followed prospectively and individuals receiving antibody treatment exhibit an improvement in their condition.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 19: The Specificity of the Anti-tumor Effects of CR011-vcMMAE (CR011-ONC-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe study was performed to determine the anti-tumor effects of the constituent components of the antibody-drug conjugate and its formulation and to relate these effects to the anti-tumor effects of the intact immunoconjugate.\n\n\n \n\n\nResults:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMice were implanted by trocar with fragments of SK-ME-2 melanoma and, after the tumors became established, treatment with CR011-vcMMAE and various components was tested to demonstrate the specificity of anti-tumor effects of this agent. Control groups, dosed with either the phosphate-buffered saline (vehicle) or the excipients of the immunoconjugate preparation (3% DMSO, sucrose, phosphate medium) steadily increased in tumor size to a maximum of 2,000 mg, at which time they were removed from the study. No apparent or statistically significant anti-tumor effects were observed. However, CR011-vcMMAE treatment (at 5 mg/kg/treatment, q4d x4) produced measurable inhibition after the first 2 doses. Tumor growth inhibition continued until no discernible tumor was detected in all 6 of the test animals (\nFigure 4\n). In preliminary studies, tumor regression was complete and was not followed by regrowth of the tumor despite lengthy observation periods (up to 200 days).\n\n\n \n\n\nConclusions:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe regressions produced by the immunoconjugate were not due to the individual components of the immunoconjugate nor to components of the formulation of that immunoconjugate. This is demonstrated by the lack of tumor growth inhibition after treatment with CR011 antibody alone (group 3) or free monomethylauristatin E (group 4), where the doses applied were identical to that contained in the intact immunoconjugate. Furthermore, the lack of anti-tumor effects noted with free MMAE suggests that anti-tumor effects from MMAE as a result of slow release from the antibody-drug conjugate may not explain the anti-tumor effects of the immunoconjugate. Release of MMAE from antibody-MMAE conjugates has been shown to be a very slow process \nin vivo\n (T\n½\nβ = 6.0 days in the case of the anti-CD30 antibody-Auristatin E immunoconjugate (\nSanderson et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 11: 843-852 (2005\n)) and would provide for plasma or serum concentrations that would be considerably lower than the \"bolus\" doses used in this study, which were ineffective at slowing the growth of the human melanoma xenografts.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 20: CR011-vcMMAE Inhibits the Growth of Human SK-MEL-5 Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXenografts Leading to Complete Regression of Established Melanoma Tumors in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthymic Mice (CR011-ONC-3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis study was performed to assess the potency and therapeutic efficacy of the antibody-drug conjugate, CR011-vcMMAE, against a second model of established human melanoma, the SK-MEL-5 xenograft.\n\n\n \n\n\nResults:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThough unrelated in origin, the SK-MEL-5 expresses GPNMB on the surface of the cell membrane and is killed by CR011-vcMMAE \nin vitro.\n In this study, the anti-tumor effects of the CR011 immunoconjugate were examined, along with the vehicles PBS and saline, and the reference agents vinblastine and paclitaxel. In a manner similar to the SK-MEL-2 tumor, vinblastine produced a noticeable, but not significant tumor growth inhibition (P ≤ 0.21) when compared to saline and PBS control groups (\nFigure 5\n). Soon after the commencement of treatment with paclitaxel, however, significant tumor growth inhibition was observed (P ≤ 0.039) at \nday\n 3 after treatment began, and this anti-tumor effect continued, producing 100 % growth inhibition (stasis). The responses of SK-MEL-5-bearing test animals to vinblastine and paclitaxel were short-lived. After cessation of treatment at the maximally tolerated doses, tumors resumed rapid, progressive growth. One long-term, tumor-free survivor occurred in the paclitaxel group and one spontaneous regression occurred in the group treated with saline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstantial tumor growth inhibition, as well as tumor growth delay and complete regressions occurred in SK-MEL-5 tumor-bearing animals after treatment with CR011-vcMMAE, and these effects were dose-related. At 10 mg/kg/treatment, significant anti-tumor effects were noted as early as 7 days (the equivalent of 2 treatments) after treatments began, when compared to saline (P ≤ 0.0096), and as early as 10 days after treatments began when compared to PBS-treated controls (P = 0.039). In a dose-related manner, CR011-vcMMAE produced tumor growth delay leading to complete regressions of established SK-MEL-5 melanoma xenografts (see tabular insert to \nFigure 5\n for proportions of animals with complete regressions). Complete regressions occurred at GR011-vcMMAE doses of 2.5 mg/kg/treatment, but not at 1.25 mg/kg/treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs in previous studies, no indication of toxicity by the immunconjugate occurred in treated animals as evidenced by mortality of effects on body weight or weight gain.\n\n\n \n\n\nConclusions:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCR011-vcMMAE exerts substantial, dose-dependent anti-tumor effects against established xenografts of the SK-MEL-5 human melanoma. After just one or two treatments significant tumor growth inhibition is noted and which leads to long-term tumor-free survivors. Complete regressions occurred at doses of ≥ 2.5 mg/kg i.v., q4d X4.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 21: Pharmacokinetics of CR011-vcMMAE (CR011-PK-IA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe purpose of this study was to determine the stability of CR011-vcMMAE \nin vivo\n after intravenous injection, the anticipated route of clinical administration.\n\n\n \n\n\nMaterials & Methods.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe CR011 antibody component of CR011-vcMMAE was measured by a sandwich style enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) where serum was added to the wells of microtiter plates coated with the cognate antigen (GPNMB, CG56972-03) for the CR011 antibody, and the amount of human antibody were detected with an anti-globulin conjugated to the signal generator (horseradish peroxidase).\n\n\n \n\n\nResults:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPharmacokinetics. The persistence of compound availability for antibody component of CR011-vcMMAE was examined in a pharmacokinetic study in athymic mice (study CRO11-PK-1, \nFigure 6\n). The serum concenhation-time profile for the antibody-drug conjugate was determined in athymic mice after intravenous administration of CR011 vcMMAE and the results are presented in \nFigure 6\n. Athymic mice receiving 1 or 10 mg/kg intravenously showed dose-proportional serum concentrations over the entire span of sampling times (42 days). The concentration-time pattern was bi-phasic. The initial phase (a), however, was minor as it contributed <2% of the total AUC. Nevertheless, the compound disappeared very slowly from the peripheral blood (T\n½\nβ = 10.3 days) with serum concentrations of 1 µg/mL and 10 µg/mL remaining in the blood for 6 weeks after dosing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEstimates for the pharmacokinetic parameters for CR011-vcMMAE are presented in Table 48.

The distribution pattern, as well as the β-elimination phase for CRO11-vcMMAE are in good agreement with values obtained for antibodies in general (see Reviews by \nMahmood and Green, Clin.

These data suggest that the compound did not distribute outside the extravascular space. Taken together, these data are in good agreement with data on other immunoconjugates bearing the -vcMMAE cytotoxic moiety (see \nHamblett et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 10: 7063-7070 (2004\n)).\n\n\n \n\n\nConclusions:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe CRO11-vcMMAE antibody-drug conjugate has a serum-concentration profile which favors continuous exposure sufficient for disruption and eradication of melanoma xenografts. The immunoconjugate after i.v. administration has a sufficiently long half-life to ensure exposure of tumor cells for extended periods (T½β= 10.3 days), and may not require frequent dosing. The durability of CRO11-vcMMAE \nin vivo (e.g.,\n athymic mice) is comparable to other Auristatin E immunoconjugates.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 22: The Schedule Dependency of the Anti-Tumor Effects of CR011-vcMMAE (CROll-ONC-1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which the curative anti-tumor effects of the CR011 antibody-drug conjugate are dependent on the dosing regimen and, if possible, to determine the optimum dosing interval for this xenograft model.\n\n\n \n\n\nMaterials and Methods:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe protocol for this study is presented in Table 49. To test the hypothesis that curative anti-tumor effects are influenced by the dosing schedule, the anti-tumor effects of CRO11-vcMMAE were measured at 5 different dosing intervals \n(i.e.,\n 0, 1, 4, 8, and 16 days between treatments) and for each \ndosing interval\n 3 dosage levels were employed \n(i.e.,\n cumulative doses of 2, 8, and 32 mg/kg); for each group, n= 6 athymic mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNota bene: Please note that, although all 5 sets of groups in this experiment \n(e.g.,\n \n \n \ngroups\n \n \n 5, 6, and 7 represent one set and received 32, 8, and 2 mg/kg cumulative dose, respectively) received the same cumulative doses, the first set receiving the \"bolus dose\" is different from the other 4 sets. The C\nmax\n for each group in the \"bolus\" set was likely four-fold higher that the C\nmax\n for the other 4 sets (see section on pharmacokinetics for dose-linearity after i.v. administration), since 4 sets of groups received 4 treatments, whereas the first set received only one \"bolus\" treatment (see \ncolumn\n 7, Table 49 below).\n\n \nTABLE 49.

The aggregate responses for each set of groups, where a set is defined as 3 groups of graduated dosage levels but one dosage interval (\n \n \ngroups\n \n \n 5, 6, and 7 represent 1 set, all of which were treated with a dosing interval of 1 day) are shown in \nFigure 7\n. The aggregate responses for test animals responding to CR011-vcMMAE appear to suggest that bolus dosing and intervals of 1 day and 4 days provide a very slight advantage to the proportion of cures, compared to longer intervals, such as 8 days and 16 days between doses. However, this effect was not significant (P <0.2904). The data therefore suggest that the anti-tumor effects of CR011 -vcMMAE in the SK-MEL-2 model are not schedule-dependent. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that test animals in the bolus set (\n \ngroups\n \n 2, 3, and 4), which were exposed to plasma concentrations approximately four-fold higher than any of the other groups, did not show any greater percentages of cured subjects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe original design of this study was expanded to include an examination of the effects of various dosage levels. For each set, one group of animals received a cumulative dose of 8 mg/kg, which, from previous studies employing a dosing interval of 4 days, provided consistent therapeutic effects leading to long-term tumor-free animals. In addition, cumulative doses of 2 mg/kg and 32 mg/kg were employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effects of dosage levels, in conjunction with various dosing intervals, are presented in \nFigure 8\n. Athymic mice receiving a cumulative dose of 32 mg/kg showed complete regressions in 100 % of each group, regardless of dosing interval; that is, a cumulative dose of 32 mg/kg is schedule-independent and represents a dose which is well above that sufficient for complete regressions in 100 % of the test animals (5 groups of 6 animals/group = 30 test animals). Animals receiving 8 mg/kg cumulative dose did not demonstrate schedule dependency and showed nearly the same proportions of complete regressions (i.e., 28/30 = 93%); Test animals receiving 2 mg/kg (cumulative dose), which was recognized in preliminary studies to be below the threshold for cures (using a standardized regimen of q4d X4) appeared to be schedule dependent, though this was not significant, and produced a much lower proportion of complete regressors \n(i.e.,\n 13%).\n\n\n \n\n\nConclusions:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe data from the dosing interval study suggests that the responses of SK-MEL-2 melanoma xenografts are not dependent on the schedule of administration of CR011-vcMMAE. While no advantage could be shown for bolus dosing or regimens with low dosing intervals, there is the suggestion that, below a certain threshold cumulative dose, there may be some advantage to combining multiple treatments into a single bolus dose.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 23: GPNMB Transcript Expression in Human Melanoma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGPNMB was recently shown to be expressed in glioblastoma and to mediate the in vitro and in vivo invasiveness of glioblastoma-derived tumor cells (see,e.g., \nLoging et al., Genome Res. 10:1393-1402 (2000\n); and \nRich et al., J. Biol. Chem. 278:15951-15975 (2003\n)). To confirm and extend these findings to additional cancer types, we examined the expression of GPNMB transcripts in human cancer cell lines and tissues.\n\n\n \n\n\nMaterial and Methods:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTotal RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit with a DNase digestion step (Qiagen Inc., Valencia CA). RT-PCR was performed using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) as follows. RT : 50°C for 45 min and 95 °C for 15 min for 1 cycle. PCR: 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 50 °C and 2 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles with final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. Products were separated on a 2% agarose/0.33% low melting point agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The integrity of each RNA sample was verified via RT-PCR with primers designed to amplify GAPDH.

Equal quantities of normalized RNA's were used as a template in PCR reactions for 40 cycles with GPNMB-specific primers to obtain threshold cycle (C\nT\n) values.

Using RTQ-PCR, GPNMB was found to be highly expressed (CT<27.0) in 5/7 melanoma cell lines and 5/5 melanoma clinical specimens examined (Table 50). In contrast, GPNMB was not expressed in a renal carcinoma cell line, TK-10, that was used as a negative control in our experiments.\n\n \nTable 50: GPNMB transcript expression in human melanoma cell lines and clinical specimens\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSample Details\n \n \n \nExpression*\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCell lines\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUACC-62\n \nMet.

Notably, 12/17 samples co-expressed high levels of GPNMB and all three melanoma/melanocyte-associated genes. Both LOXIMVI and TK-10 cell lines, which had undetectable GPNMB expression, also lacked expression of the three melanoma/melanocyte-associated genes examined.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 24: Growth-inhibitory Activity of CRO11-vcMMAE is Dependent on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPNMB Expression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterial and Methods:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFlow cytometry:\n Quantitative analysis of GPNMB expression on the cell surface of cell lines was determined by flow cytometry. Approximately 1x10\n6\n cells were harvested, washed and incubated with a saturating amount (10 µg/mL)of either CRO11 or isotype-matched control antibody in staining buffer containing PBS (pH 7.4), 4% FBS and 0.1 % NaN3 for 30 min on ice, followed by washing and staining with R-Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated goat-anti-human antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, West Grove, PA) at 1:100 for 30 min on ice. Cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde/PBS and examined on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Data analysis was performed with Becton Dickinson Cell Quest software version 3.3 and the geometric mean fluorescence intensity ratio (GMR) was determined for each cell type.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternalization of cell surface bound antibodies was assessed by a modified flow cytometry procedure. In brief, cell suspensions were labeled with 10 µg/mL unconjugated or MMAE-conjugated CR011 for 30 min on ice. After washing cells, incubation was shifted to 37°C for 1 hr to allow internalization of bound antibodies. Cells that remained on ice (total surface bound) or that were incubated at 37°C (internalized) were stained with PE-conjugated goat-anti-human antibody at 1:100 for 30 min to detect CRO11 retained on the cell surface. Labeled cells were analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. The percentage of antibody internalized was determined using the GMRs and the following formula:\n\n \n \n \nPercent internalized = Total surface bound (4°C) - Total surface bound (37°C)/ Total surface bound (4°C) x 100\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis:\n Cells were harvested and lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer containing 1 % NP-40, 0.15 M NaC1, 0.02 M Tris-HCI, 10% glycerol, 0.01 M EDTA and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Supernatants were collected and the protein concentration was determined with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For immunoprecipitation, 2 µg of primary antibody was added into 0.5-1 mg of total cell lysates and incubated at 4°C for 3 hrs, followed by incubation with protein-A-agarose (Amersham Biosciences, Upsala, Sweden) on ice for 2 hrs. The agarose beads were washed in ice-cold TBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20). Immunoprecipitates were recovered from supernatants after boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and centrifugation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor immunoblot analysis, total cell lysates (50 µg) or immunoprecipitates were resolved under reducing condition on 4-20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically transferred to 0.45-µmPVDF membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked with 3% BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in TBST for 3 hrs and probed with rabbit anti-GPNMB polyclonal antibody (1:1000) for 3 hrs. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) was added and incubated for 30 min. The membranes were washed in TBST and subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) following the manufacturer's protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nClonogenic Assays:\n The growth-inhibitory activity of CRO11-vcMMAE was determined by clonogenic assay. Cells were plated in 96-well plates and allowed to recover overnight. Unconjugated CRO11, free MMAE, CRO11-vcMMAE or isotype-matched vcMMAE conjugated antibody at various concentrations was added to sub-confluent cell cultures and incubated for 4 days at 37°C: The cells were then transferred into 6-well plates and allowed to form colonies. Colonies were stained with Giemsa stain (Sigma) and counted. The surviving cell fractions were calculated based upon the ratio of the treated sample and the untreated control. The results were expressed as a percentage of control using \nGraphPad Prism Version\n 4 software. The IC50 was defined as the concentration resulting in a 50% reduction of colony formation compared to untreated control cultures.\n\n\n \n\n\nResults:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo demonstrated that CR011-vcMMAE growth-inhibitory activity is dependent on GPNMB expression, full-length GPNMB protein was ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells. Immnunoblot (\nFigure 9A\n) and FACS (\nFigure 9B\n) analyses confirmed that GPNMB was expressed in GPNMB/plasmid transfected cells. Treatment of cells with CR011-vcMMAE, followed by clonogenic assay, demonstrated that GPNMB-expressing HEK293 cells were more sensitive to CRO11-vcMMAE-mediated growth-inhibition than were control cells devoid of GPNMB expression (\nFigure 9C\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo further verify our findings, GPNMB-expressing SK-Mel-2 cells were transfected with siRNA to specifically inhibit endogenous GPNMB expression. Immunoblot and FACS analyses performed 2 and 4 days after transfection demonstrated that total GPNMB (\nFigure 10A\n) and surface GPNMB (\nFigure 10B\n) protein levels were significantly reduced in SK-Mel-2 cells after the transfection when compared to the control transfectants. The amount of GPNMB expression was reduced for at least 7 days after transfection. Treatment of these cells with CR011-vcMMAE demonstrated that SK-Mel-2 cells were less sensitive to the growth-inhibitory activity of CR011-vcMMAE following siRNA-mediated GPNMB knockdown (\nFigure 10C\n). Taken together, these data indicate that the growth-inhibitory activity of CRO11-vcMMAE required cell surface GPNMB expression.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 25: Cell Cycle Arrest and Induction of Apoptosis by CR011-vcIVIMAE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo evaluate CRO11-vcMMAE's mechanism of growth inhibition, cell cycles analysis was performed.\n\n\n \n\n\nMaterial and Methods:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cell cycle effects of CR011-vcMMAE were evaluated after treating cells in complete growth medium for 24 or 48 hr. Briefly, cells were pulsed at the indicated times with 30 µM of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma) for 30 min, harvested, fixed and permeabilized in methanol. Nascent DNA synthesis was detected by anti-bromodeoxyuridine-FITC (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) staining. Total DNA content was detected using propidium iodide (PI, Sigma). For apoptosis analysis, cells were treated as above and labeled with Annexin V-FITC followed by propidium iodide exclusion using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit I (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Flow cytometry (as described in the previous Example) was used to assay both cell cycle and apoptosis studies.\n\n\n \n\n\nResults:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nGPNMB-positive SK-Mel-2 cells or negative TK-10 control cells were treated with CRO11-vcMMAE for various lengths of time, followed by bromodeoxyuridine for 30 minutes to detect nascent DNA synthesis and finally, propidium iodide to detect total DNA content. DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression were determined by flow cytometry (Table 52).\n\n \nTable 52.

In contrast, CRO11-vcMMAE did not affect the cycling of GPNMB-negative cells.

To investigate this possibility, analysis of apoptosis using Annexin-V surface binding and loss of propidium iodide (PI) exclusion was performed. Our results demonstrated that 1000 ng/mL of CR011-vcMMAE induced apoptosis specifically in GPNMB-expressing cells as indicated by an 11 % increase in mono-stained (Annexm-V+/PI-) cells following 48 hr of CR011-vcMMAE treatment (Table 53).\n\n \nTable 53.

The naked CRO11 IgG2 mAb (mAb 1.15) had no effect on CG56972 expressing cells either in vitro or in vivo. Thus we examined whether isotype switching from an IgG2 to an IgG1 might enable the mAb to kill human melanoma cells through ADCC effector functions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, to switch \nCR011\n 1 from an IgG2 to IgG1 antibody, double stranded DNA encoding constant region of IgG1 (allotype Gm(f)) was synthesized, and IgG2 constant region was replaced with IgG1 constant region using overlapped PCR approach. The sequences are described below:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCRO11 mAb 1.15.1 mature heavy chain (IgG2):\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCRO11 mAb 1.15.1 mature heavy chain (IgG1):\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe first analyzed the binding properties of the IgG1 and IgG2 fully human monoclonal antibodies on SK-MEL-2 melanoma cells that have been shown to express CG56972 on the cell surface and bind CRO11 IgG2. As shown in \nFigure 11\n, both the IgG1 and IgG2 mAbs caused comparable FACS shifts on SK-MEL-2 cells compared to isotype control mAbs (\nFigure 11\n) indicating that both isotypes bind to CG56972/GPNMB with comparable saturation densities and affinities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe next examined whether the CRO11 IgG1 mAb could induce ADCC in SK-MEL-2 cells in culture in the presence of human PBMC. Human PBMC were isolated from whole blood using a Ficoll-Plaque. Briefly, in a 50 mL tube, 15 mL of PBS was added to 20 mL of whole blood which was underlayed with 10 mL Ficoll-Plaque and the tube was centrifuged at 2000 RPM. Mononuclear cells were collected from the interface and washed 3 times with PBS. The ADCC assay was carried out in a 96 well plate using a fluorescence assay for cytolysis from Perkin-Elmer (DELFIA EuTDA Cytotoxic assay). The procedure is based on loading target cells with a fluorescence enhancing ligand (BATDA, bis (acetoxymethyl) terpyridine ―dicarboxylate). The hydrophic ligand penetrates the membrane quickly. Within the cell the esterbonds are hydrolyzed to form a hydrophilic ligand (TDA, terpyridine ―dicarboxylic acid) which can no longer pass through the membrane. After cytolysis the ligand is released and introduced to the Europium solution. The europium and the ligand form a highly fluorescent and stable chelate (EuTDA). Fluorescence intensity are recorded using excitation and emission wavelengths as λex = 340 nm and λem = 613 nm, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity on SIC-MEL-2 cells was assayed in the presence of PBMC and CRO11 monoclonal antibody using effector: target ratios of 10, 30, 60 and 100 and various concentrations of IgG1 or IgG2 mAb against CG56972/GPNMB (2, 5, 10 µg/200µl). Our data showed that between 30 to 100 fold PBMC, IgG1 mAb caused cytolysis of SK-MEL-2 cells in a dose dependent manner (\nFigure 12A\n) whereas IgG2 mAb did not show any cytolysis (\nFigure 12B\n). Therefore, we conclude that CR011 IgG1 mAb to CG56972/GPNMB can kill CG56972/GPNMB expressing melanoma cells in vitro and potentially human melanoma in vivo through ADCC effector functions. CR011 IgG1 mAb can also be useful in combination with immune effector cytokines that could provide some clinical benefit in metastatic melanoma such as high dose IL-2, interferon-gamma or TNF-alpha. CR011 can also be used to treat melanoma in combination with vaccine immunotherapy, immunomodulators such as MDX-010, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 27: Treatment of Astrocytoma, Glioblastoma, Medulloblastoma and Other\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntumors of the CNS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAstrocytoma/glioblastoma is a highly drug-refractory neoplasm representing significant unmet medical needs. We identified CG56972 as a human gene (also known as GPNMB) that is highly expressed in these human cancer tissues and cancer cell lines. CG56972 is a type I transmembrane protein potentially involved in vesicular trafficking with a very restricted expression pattern in human brain. We generated fully human monoclonal antibodies against the CG56972 extracellular domain (amino acids 23-480). Our lead monoclonal antibody, designated CR011-vcMMAE was biochemically characterized and tested for therapeutic activity against cell lines derived from human brain tumors of astrocytoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma or neuroectodennal origin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTranscript expression analysis demonstrated highly elevated CG56972 mRNA in brain tumors derived from astrocytoma, glioblastomas, medulloblastoma and tumors of neuroectodermal origin with restricted low expression in normal brain. CRO11 bound by FACS analysis surface CG56972 on brain cancer cell lines. CRO11 mAbs western blotted the predicted 100 and 120 kDa gene products. Clonogenic assays demonstrated that CR011-vcMMAE mAbs inhibited the growth of brain cancer cell lines.\n\n\n \n\n\nMaterial and Methods:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell lines and culture conditions:\n All human cell lines, SK-MEL-2, XF-498, SNB-78, U-118-MG, SF-539, H79MG, D392-MG, D534-MG, SK-N-SH, U-251, SF-295, D450-MG, U87MG, SF-268, T98G, and SW-1783 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) or were purchased from the NCI (Bethesda, MD). Cells were maintained in DMEM or RPMI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 10% FBS (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA) and penicillin-streptomycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nReal-Time Quantitative PCR (RTQ-PCR):\n Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit with a DNase digestion step (Qiagen Inc., Valencia). RNA samples were derived from normal human tissues obtained commercially (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or cell lines grown according to specifications. RNAs were harvested and PCR was performed as previously described (Shimkets RA et. al. Nat Biotechnol., 1999. 17-8: 798-803) using TaqMan® reagents (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). RNAs were normalized utilizing human β-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) TaqMan® probes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal quantities of normalized RNA were used as templates in PCR reactions with CG56972-specific reagents to obtain threshold cycle (CT) values. For graphic representation, CT numbers were converted to relative expression, relative to the sample exhibiting the highest level of expression. RTQ-PCR analysis was performed with an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System using TaqMan reagents (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The following primers (5'-3') were used:\n\n \n \n \nForward-TCAATGGAACCTTCAGCCTTA (SEQ ID NO: 338)\n \nReverse-GAAGGGGTGGGTTTTGAAG (SEQ ID NO: 339)\n \nProbe-TET-GTCACTGTGAAAGCTGCAGCACCAG -TAMRA (SEQ ID NO: 340)\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCuraChip\n™:Tissues were lysed in Trizol. Biotin-labeled cDNA was made by using 15 mg of total RNA with poly(T) primers. Gene expression was evaluated by hybridization to the proprietary CuraChip microarray (CuraGen, New Haven, CT) of 11,000 oligonucleotide probes. Slides were hybridized for 15 at 30°C with constant rotation, washed for 30 min at room temperature (RT), incubated in streptavidin solution (4°C, 30min), washed three times for 15 min at RT, incubated in Cy3-conjugated detection buffer (4°C, 30 min), and washed three times for 15 min at RT. Slides were scanned (GMS 418 Scanner,Genetic Microsystems, Woburn, MA) and analyzed by using IMAGENE software (BioDiscovery, Marina Del Rey, CA). Data was subjected to 90th percentile normalization, and expression of the CG56972 gene was analyzed in comparison to that of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. The oligonucleotide sequence used to detect CG56972 is 5'-TGATCAGTAAGGATTTCACCTCTGTTTGTA (SEQ ID NO: 341). The oligonucleotide sequence used to detect GAPDH is 5'-ACCTTGTCATGTACCATCAATAAAGTACCC (SEQ ID NO: 342), corresponding to bp 1243-1272 of the GAPDH transcript (accession no. NM_002046).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFlow Cytometry:\n Quantitative analysis of CG56972 expression on the surface of cell lines was determine by flow cytometry (FACS). Approximately 1 x 10\n6\n cells were harvested, washed and incubated with a saturating amount (10 µg/mL).of either CRO11 or isotype-matched control antibody in staining buffer containing PBS (pH 7.4), 4% FBS and 0.1 % NaN3 for 30 min on ice, followed by washing and staining with R-Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated goat-anti-human antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, West Grove, PA) at 1:100 for 30 min on ice. Cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde/PBS and examined on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Data analysis was performed with Becton Dickinson Cell Quest software version 3.3 and the geometric mean fluorescence intensity ratio (GMR) was determined for each cell type.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nImmunoblot analysis:\n SK-MEL-2, XF-498, SNB-78, U-118-MG, SF-539, H79MG, D392-MG, D534-MG, SK-N-SH, U-251, SF-295, D450-MG, U87MG, SF-268, T98G, and SW-1783 cells were harvested and lysed on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer containing 1 % NP-40, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.02 M Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01 M EDTA and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Supernatants were collected and the protein concentration was determined with the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For immunoblot analysis, 40 ul of total cell lysate from one well of confluent cells harvested from a 6 well Falcon tissue culture dish were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, centrifuged and resolved under reducing condition on 4-20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen). Gels were electrophoretically transferred to 0.45-µm PVDF membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked with 3% BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in TBST for 3 hrs and probed with goat anti-GPNMB polyclonal IgG (R & D Systems; 1 µg/mL, total 10 µg)) for 3 hrs. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) was added and incubated for 30 min. The membranes were washed in TBST and subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) following the manufacturer's protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nClonogenic assays:\n The growth-inhibitory activity of CR011-vcMMAE was determined by clonogenic assay. Cells were plated in 96-well plates and allowed to recover overnight. CR011-vcMMAE or isotype-matched monoclonal antibody at various concentrations was added to sub-confluent cell cultures and incubated for 4 days at 37°C. The cells were then transferred into 6-well plates and allowed to form colonies. Colonies were stained with Giemsa stain (Sigma) and counted. The surviving cell fractions were calculated based upon the ratio of the treated sample and the untreated control. The results were expressed as a percentage of control using \nGraphPad Prism Version\n 4 software. The IC50 was defined as the concentration resulting in a 50% reduction of colony formation compared to untreated control cultures.\n\n\n \n\n\nResults:\n\n\n\n\n1. CG56972 transcript expression in human astrocytoma, glioblastoma, medulloblastoma and tumors of neuroectodermal origin.\n\n\n \n \n \nWe examined the expression of CGS6972 transcripts in human cancer cell lines and tissues (\nFigures 13 A & B\n). Our transcript expression analysis indicated that CG56972 was strongly expressed in all (15/15) human brain cancer cell lines tested (\nFigure 13A\n) Using RTQ-PCR, CG56972 was found to be expressed in cells of mixed glioblastoma/astrocytoma orgin, glioblastoma/gliomas, astrocytomas and metastatic neuroblastomas. The majority of brain or CNS tumor cell lines showed high level expression with CTs<27. Of note, CG56972 was found to be highly expressed (CT<27.0) in XF-498, U-118-MG, SNB-78, and SF-539 cells. As shown in \nFigure 13B\n, CG56972 was also expressed at high levels in 4/5 glioma human biopsies and 1/4 medulloblastoma human biopsies. Using microarray analysis from an in house chip containing a large panel of human genes (\nFigure 13C\n), CG56972 was found to be highly expressed in 5/9 brain cancers of astrocytoma or glioblastoma origin as well as 4/9 oligodendrogliomas. Our analysis of these tumor expression profiles showed that CG56972 message was detected to a much lesser degree in normal brain tissues. These data are also consistent with our immunohistochemical data that demonstrated the lack of CRO11 staining in normal human brain including neurons and glial cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the CG56972 transcript is expressed at highly elevated quantities in brain cancer and oligodendroglioma cell lines and specimens isolated from human tumors.\n\n\n \n2. Generation of fully human CRO11 monoclonal antibodies to CG56972/GPNMB\n\n\n \n \n \nThe CG56972 protein is predicted to be a type I transmembrane glycoprotein. The highly elevated expression of CG56972 transcripts and the potential cell surface localization of this protein in human cancer samples encouraged us to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as a potential cancer therapeutic. Therefore, we cloned the human CG56972 extracellular domain (ECD; aa 23-480). Sequencing of the cloned cDNA revealed the presence of an in-frame 36-nt insertion, likely due to alternative splicing at the \nexon\n 6/7 boundary, which added an additional 12-aa (ATTLKSYDSNTP) (SEQ ID NO: 343) after residue 339 of the published GPNMB protein sequence. We verified the authenticity of 36-nt insertion via RT-PCR. The cDNA was next expressed in human HEK293 cells. The resultant protein was harvested, purified from the conditioned media and used as an immunogen to generate fully human mAbs against CG56972-ECD. Following immunization of XeiioMotisc®, mAbs that specifically recognized the CG56972-ECD protein via ELISA were generated. Our lead mAb, designated 1.15 or CRO11 against purified CG56972-ECD, exhibiting a Kd of 52 nM against purified CG56972-ECD protein, was selected for in depth characterization and will be the focus of the remainder of this example.\n\n\n \n3. CRO11 mAb 1.15 detection of CG56972 protein expression in human brain cancers\n\n\n \n \n \nWe further used CRO11 monoclonal antibodies to examine the surface expression of CG56972 protein on a variety of brain cancer cell lines by flow cytometry (\nFigure 14\n & Table 54). FACS analysis demonstrated that the brain cancer cell lines XF-498, U-118-MG, SNB-78 and SF-539; all positive for CG56972 transcript expression exhibited surface staining with CR011 monoclonal antibodies of at least 1.5-fold above isotype control mAb background (\nFigure 14\n). The cell line SF-268, that was the most weakly positive 32) for the CG56972 transcript expression (\nFigure 13C\n & Table 54) showed minimal surface staining as expected of around 1.5-fold above control mAb background. Our SK-MEL-2 melanoma cell line that is our positive control for CG56972 expression showed strong cell surface staining.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo investigate CG56972 protein expression in our panel of brain cancer cell lines, total cell lysates were harvest, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membrane filters and subjected to immunoblot analysis with a CG56972 polyclonal antibody. As shown in \nFigure 15\n, the CG56972 polyclonal antibody detected two protein species that are differential glycosylation products of CG56972 of approximately 100 and 120 kDa from various brain cancer cell lines that have been shown to express CG56972 transcripts (\nFigure 13A\n). CG56972 protein was highly expressed in XF-498, SNB-78 and H79-MG and SF-539 cells. Both p100 and p120 species were detected to a lesser extent in U-118-MG, U251, D534-MG and D450-MG. Little or no CG56972 protein was detected in weakly expressing CG56972 transcript cell line, SF-268. An isotype-matched control IgG2 antibody did not immunoprecipitate CG56972 from any of the cell lines examined. All of these data are consistent with the cell surface expression of the CG56972 protein of the predicted molecule weights in brain cancer.\n\n\n \n4. In vitro growth-inhibition of astrocytoma/glioblastoma cell lines with CR011-vcMMAE.\n\n\n \n \n \nCG56972 possesses a very restricted human tissue expression pattern. In preliminary studies, CRO11 did not inhibit the growth of CG56972-expressing cancer cell lines when used directly (data not shown). Since CG56972 is a cell surface molecule on brain cancers and melanoma, and since CRO11 was internalized following incubation with CG56972-expressing cells, we evaluated whether CR011 would inhibit the growth of cancer cells when combined with a protein synthesis inhibitor (saporin)-conjugated secondary antibody. Our results indicated that CR011 could specifically inhibit the growth of CG56972-expressing cancer cells (data not shown). Thus, we conjugated CRO11 directly to the cytotoxic drug monomethyl aurostatin E (MMAE) through a highly stable, but intracellular protease cleavable valine-citnilline (vc) linker. The resulting antibody-drug conjugate was named CRO11-vcMMAE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo investigate whether CRO11-vcMMAE specifically inhibited the growth of brain cancer cells, clonogenic assays were performed to assess cell viability after CR011-vcMMAE treatment. As shown in \nFigure 16\n and Table 54, our results indicated that CG56972-expressing cells were sensitive to growth-inhibition induced by CR011-vvMMAE, but not cells that poorly expressed this antigen (see SF-268 and LOXIMVI) at concentrations of vcMMAE less than 3 µg/mL. Strikingly, CR011-vcMMAE possessed IC50s of approximately 215, 450, 1250, and 1050 ng/mL on XF-498, SNB-78, U-118-MG and SF-539 cells (\nFigure 16\n and Table 54). In these experiments, IC50s correlated with cell surface density as measured by FACS analysis. In contrast, conjugated control human IgG2 antibody-vcMMAE failed to inhibit the growth of any of the cell lines examined at concentrations up to 3 µg/mL (Table 54) with IC50s exceeding 1.5 or 4.5 µg/mL (Table 54).\n\n \nTable 54.

CRO11-vcMMAE can also be useful for the treatment of melanoma metastasis to brain and other brain neoplasms such as neoplastic meningitis.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 28: Engineered Antibodies Derived from CR011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe GR011 bi-scFv's (see \nFigure 17\n) of this work were designed to bind to a CD3 epitope of the T cell receptor on cytotoxic human T lymphocytes and, at the same time, to target diseased cells expressing GPNMB, with the net result of facilitating the lysis or destruction of the diseased cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe V\nL\n and V\nH\n domains of mAb CR011, clone 1.15 were used in the construction of 3 CRO11 based engineered antibodies:\n\n \n \n \n(1) CRO11 single chain antibody (CRO11 scFv)\n \n(2) CR011 x anti-CD3 bispecific single chain antibody (bi-scFv), Linker set L4-L2-L4\n \n(3) CRO11 x anti-CD3 bispecific single chain antibody (bi-scFv), Linker set L4-L4-L4\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe components of the CRO11 scFv protein were: Signal Peptide-V\nL\n (CR011)-Linker 4-V\nH\n (CR011)-Flag Tag. The components of the CR011 x anti-CD3 bi-scFv (Linker set L4-L2-L4) protein were: Signal Peptide-V\nL\n (CR011)-Linker 4-V\nH\n (CR011 )-Linker 2-V\nH\n (anti-CD3)-Linker 4-V\nL\n (anti-CD3)-Flag Tag. The components of the CR011 1 x anti-CD3 bi-scFv (Linker set L4-L4-L4) protein were: Signal Peptide-V\nL\n (CR011)-Linker 4-V\nH\n (CR011)-Linker 4-V\nH\n (anti-CD3)-Linker 4-V\nL\n (anti-CD3)-Flag Tag.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe various DNA components outlined above were used to generate the three CRO11 engineered antibody products. The DNA components were synthesized by Blue Heron and cloned into commercially available plasmid vectors by methods familiar to those skilled in the art. These plasmids were then used in PCRs to combine the components, indicated in the 3 examples above, to generate engineered antibody inserts for expression vectors. In the host expression system examples practicing this invention described below, we have used CHOK1 mammalian cells for the CRO11 expression vectors, but expression is not limited to these cells; it will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the CRO11 engineered antibodies of this invention can be expressed using other vectors, systems and cells, including but not limited to: pET vectors, inducible and constitutive promoters, and hosts may include E. \ncoli, Bacillus\n species, yeast, including \nPichia pastoris\n or insect cells. Other expression hosts can also include various plant species and transgenic animals such as goats.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nSP (Signal Peptide):\n We incorporated a signal peptide in our constructs in order to express products that will be secreted. The signal peptide which was utilized for expression from CHO cells was derived from an immunoglobulin light chain leader peptide (Jirik \net al.,\n 1986), or from the CR002 antibody (CuraGen).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nOrder of the bi-scFv components:\n The order of the antibody variable domains was fixed in both bi-scFv constructs as follows: V\nL\n1-L-V\nH\n1-L-V\nH\n2-\nL-V\n \n \n \nL\n2. Each of the 4 V domains was linked by a linker segment, \nL. V\n \n \n \nL\n1 and \nV\n \n \n \nH\n1 represent the immunoglobulin light and heavy chain variable domains respectively of CR011, and \nV\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nV\n \n \n \nL\n2 represent the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable domains respectively of an anti-CD3 antibody that was used for both bi-scfv constructs. Other orders of the V domains can also be used for the 2 scFv components, as recognized by those skilled in the art, and the products evaluated for biological activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nTag:\n We used the 8 amino acid Flag tag at the C-terminus of the CR011 engineered antibodies to facilitate detection and purification of the products (Hickman \net al.,\n 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAnti-CD3 scFv:\n The sequences of the V\nL\n and V\nH\n components of the anti-CD3 antibody used to generate the bi-scFv constructs may be found in the NCBI database under accession number CAE85148 (Lutterbuese \net al.)\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nLinkers used in constructs:\n The sequence of L2, a short 5 amino acid linker that links the 2 monomer scFv components together in CR011 x anti-CD3 bi-scFv (L4-L2-L4 linker set) is G\n4\nS (Mack \net al.,\n 1995). L4 is a 25 amino acid linker based on the 205C linker (Denzin \net al.,\n 1991): LSADDAKKDAAKKDDAKKDDAKKDL (SEQ ID NO: 344) and is used in both of the CRO11 bi-scFv species to link the CR011 V\nL\n and V\nH\nand the anti-CD3 V\nH\n and V\nL\n. In the case of the CR011 x anti-CD3 bi-scFv (L4-L4-L4 linker set), L4 is also used to link the 2 monomer scFv components together. For the CRO11 scFv, the L4 linker was used to link the two variable domains together.\n\n\n \n1.

Protein Purification of the CR011 Engineered Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein purification for the CR011 scFv Flag and CR011 x anti-CD3 (L4-L2-L4 linker set) bi-scFv Flag was accomplished in three chromatography steps, including affinity, ion exchange and size exclusion chromatographies. For the purification of CR011 x anti-CD3 (L4-L4-L4 linker set) bi-scFv Flag protein, affinity and size exclusion chromatographies were used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAffinity chromatography was performed using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma, cat# A2220-25 mL) as per the manufacturer's instructions on a BioCAD 700E instrument (Applied Biosystems). Ion exchange chromatography was performed on a \nMonoQ\n 5/50 GL column (Amersham, cat# 17-5166-01) using 20 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5 as equilibration buffer and a gradient elution with 0 -1 M NaCl. Size exclusion chromatography was performed using a \nSuperdex\n 75/10/300 GL column (Amersham, cat#17-5174-01) following the manufacturer's protocols on BioCAD 700E (Applied Biosystems) liquid chromatography instrument.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe approximate yields from 1 L conditioned CHOK1 media were:\n\n \n \n \n(1) CR011 scFv: 1.0 mg\n \n(2) CR011 x anti-CD3 (L4-L2-L4 linker set) bi-scFv: 0.5 mg\n \n(3) CR011 x anti-CD3 (L4-L4-L4 linker set) bi-scFv: 1.5 mg\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified proteins was determined by Edman degradation, using methods known to those skilled in the art.

Testing of the 3 CR011 engineered antibodies by ELISA, flow cytometry and determination of cytotoxicity:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nELISA:\n \n The binding of the CR011 engineered antibodies to purified recombinant GPNMB (2 µg/mL) was measured using plates coated overnight at 4°C. Plates were then blocked and washed. Various dilutions of the CRO11 engineered antibodies were added into the wells. Plates were incubated for 1 h and washed. HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added into the wells for 1 h, washed and the reaction developed with the TMB substrate reagent as described by the manufacturer (Pharmingen, San Jose, CA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding of the CR011 scFv and CR011 x anti-CD3 (L4-L2-L4 linker set) bi-scFv product to GPNMB was first confirmed using ELISA, as shown in \nFigure 18\n. Plates were coated with human GPNMB protein tagged with His and V5. Coated plates were incubated with either supernatants containing CR011 X anti-CD3 bi-scFv or purified CR011 scFv monomer. Binding of the recombinant mAbs (both monomer and dimer) was detected using anti-FLAG-HRP conjugated mAb M2 (Sigma). As can be seen in \nFigure 18\n, both anti-GPNMB antibody species described bind to the recombinant GPNMB protein, indicating that the specificity and binding activity of the engineered anti-GPNMB antibody, using the methods described in this example, was preserved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFlow cytometry:\n \n The binding of the CRO11 engineered antibodies to native proteins was analyzed by FACS. Briefly, human T cells and SK-Mel-5 cells were incubated with either the CRO11 scFv or CRO11 x anti-CD3 (L4-L2-L4 linker set) bi-scFv (5 µg/sample/100 µl) with subsequent staining with mouse anti-FLAG mAb (Sigma) and PE-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig F(ab')\n2\n. (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) Ten thousand events were collected and analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo confirm binding of the CR011 scFv and CR011 x anti-CD3 (L4-L2-L4 linker set) bi-scFv products to native GPNMB protein expressed on the cell surface, we used SK-Mel-5 cells which naturally express GPNMB. To verify binding of the bi-scFv to human CD3 molecules, we used purified human T cells. As a positive control we used native PE conjugated anti-CD3-PE and CRO11 mAb. Binding of the CR011 scFv was detected using anti-FLAG mAb M2 with subsequent staining with PE conjugated anti mouse IgG, while for detection of CR011 mAb binding we used anti-human IgG-PE. Control anti-CD3 mAb bound to T cells, and control anti-GPNMB mAb bound to SK-Mel-5 tumor cells. We found that only the CRO11 x anti-CD3 (L4-L2-L4 linker set) bi-scFv stained T cells; the CR011 scFv monomer did not bind CD3 positive T cells, as expected (see \nFigure 19\n). Binding to SK-Mel-5 cells by either the CR011 scFv monomer or CR011 X anti-CD3 (L4-L2-L4 linker set) bi-scFv was present at a low level (\nFigure 19\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCytotoxicity:\n \n The ability of CR011 x anti-CD3 (L4-L2-L4 linker set) bi-scFv to redirect human T lymphocytes to kill relevant human tumor cells was measured by flow cytometry. Tumor cells were labeled with PKH2 green fluorescent linker kit (Sigma) and washed. Purified T cells were cultured O/N with PKH2-labeled tumor cells in the presence or absence of purified bi-scFv. Death of GPNMB positive tumor cells was measured by propidium iodine (PI) incorporation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo evaluate the ability of the CR011 x anti-CD3 (L4-L2-L4 linker set) bi-scFv product to increase T cell mediated killing of GPNMB positive cells, we performed a cytotoxicity test. Purified T cells were cultured O/N with PKH2-labeled SK-Mel-5 (GPNMB positive) tumor cells in the presence of various doses of purified CRO11 scFv and CR011 x anti-CD3 (L4-L2-L4 linker set) bi-scFv products.\n\n\n \n\n\nConclusion:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe CRO11 x anti-CD3 (L4-L2-L4 linker set) bi-scFv significantly increased killing of SK-Mel-5 tumor cells by T lymphocytes (\nFigure 20\n). In contrast, the addition of monospecific anti-GPNMB scFv did not increase killing of SK-Mel-5 tumors. In addition, no cytotoxicity was observed when the tumor cells were cultured with the CRO11 x anti-CD3 (L4-L2-L4 linker set) bi-scFv without T lymphocytes (\nFigure 20\n). These data indicate that the CR011 x anti-CD3 (L4-L2-L4 linker set) bi-scFv provided sufficient bridging between T cells and SK-Mel-5 cells to induce cell death and that both components of this engineered CR011 bi-specific antibody were biologically active. Therefore the CRO11 x anti-CD3 (L4-L2-L4 linker set) bi-scFv engineered antibody of the present invention may be used as a therapeutic to treat diseases, such as melanoma and other cancers where there are upregulated levels of GPNMB and T cells present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther methods of cytotoxicity analysis, including fluorescence and chromium release assays can be used to demonstrate the usefulness of the CR011 x anti-CD3 (L4-L2-L4 linker set) bi-scFv in treating tumors. Other linkers may also be used to link the two scFv monomer components together, as in the CRO1 lxanti-CD3 (linker set L4-L4-L4) molecule described \nsupra.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 29: Optimized Production Process of CR011-vcMMAE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCR011AE is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of the anti-GPNMB (CG56972) fully human antibody CR011 conjugated with the toxin Auristatin E through a protease-cleavable linker. The toxin-to-antibody ratio is approx. 4.0 but may vary between 3.5 and 4.2. While the CR011 antibody is IgG2, it is therefore possible to append up to 12 toxin molecules per antibody molecule using the free thiols as a reactive site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure of Maleimidocoaproyl-Valine-Citrullin-Monomethyl-Auristatin E (vcMMAE) is shown in \nFigure 21\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugation: A process of generating the drug-substance consisting of CR011 mAb with VCMMAE attached. An overview of the conjugation process is summarized in \nFigure 22\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, the conjugation process for CR011 fully human antibody consists of the following 4 steps. 1) Buffer exchange and sucrose removal by diafiltration, 2) Disulfides reduction, 3) Conjugation to vcMMAE and finally, 4) Purification of conjugated CR011-vcMMAE by diafiltration. There are several assays throughout the process, i.e. in-process assays, which include Ellman's assay and determination of protein concentration. At the end of the process, the drug substance, i.e. the conjugate, is analyzed for drug-to-antibody ratio, free drug content and protein concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nDiafiltration of the bulk antibody:\n The bulk antibody originally formulated in phosphate pH 7 -10% sucrose was buffer exchanged into the conjugation buffer (borate pH 9.0 - NaCl) by diafiltration over 10 diavolumes. At the end of diafiltration, CR011 was diluted to ~5.5 mg/mL and filtered through a set of two filters consisting of 1.2 and 0.22 µm. The buffer exchange is required because sucrose interferes with reduction. In addition, high pH improves CRO11 solubility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCR011 reduction - General considerations:\n CRO11 is produced as an IgG2 isotype product and contains 6 disulfide bridges in the hinge region. These disulfides can be reduced under mild conditions to give rise to 12 cysteine residues. Therefore, it is possible to maximally attach 12 vcMMAE drug molecules per antibody. For the process, however, the bulk antibody is only partially reduced because the aim is to generate conjugates with an average of 4 vcMMAE molecules. The reason for this is two-fold. First, it broadens the therapeutic window by decreasing potential systemic toxicity associated with MMAE. Second, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to produce fully-loaded conjugates with low aggregation because of greatly reduced solubility imparted by the hydrophobic drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nProcess:\n Tris-(carboxyethyl)-phosphine or TCEP was added at the 4:1 molar ratio (TCEP:mAb) to CRO11 at a concentration of ~5.5 mg/mL in the jacketed reactor equipped with an agitator set to 90 RPM. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 3 hours at 37°C in the presence of 1 mM EDTA. At the end, Ellman's assay was used to determine the amount of free thiols. Typically, it was 4.2 thiolsper antibody. The reactor was then chilled to 4°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCR011 conjugation - General considerations:\n TCEP was not fully consumed during the reduction. The left over TCEP was capable of reacting with vcMMAE. However, this spurious side reaction was slower compared to the conjugation reaction and can be mitigated by adding an excess of vcMMAE. The advantage of TCEP compared to DTT is that it does not require removal of the left-over reducing agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nProcess:\n vcMMAE was dissolved in DMSO and added at 20% molar excess to the reduced CRO11 mAb. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 hour. The final concentration of DMSO is 4% (v/v). DMSO played a dual purpose in the process. It is required for solubilizing the drug and also it helps to solubilize the conjugate. At the end of conjugation, N-acetylcysteine was added to quench any unreacted drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCR011-vcMMAE purification:\n The temperature in the reactor was brought to room temperature. A 40% sucrose stock solution was used to adjust the final sucrose concentration to 10% (w/v) followed by a pH adjustment using 300 mM histidine HCl pH 5.0 buffer to a final pH of 6.0. The conjugate was then purified by diafiltration into 20 mM histidine pH 6.0-10% sucrose (w/v) buffer and using 10 diavolumes. At the end of diafiltration, the conjugate was concentrated to ~7 mg/mL and filtered through a set of three filters consisting of 1.2, 0.45 and finally, 0.22 µm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCR011-vcMMAE formulation:\n The conjugate was formulated by adding Tween-20 to a final concentration of 0.02% and by diluting to 6 mg/mL (±10%) using formulation buffer (20 mM histidine pH 6.0, 10% sucrose, 0.02% Tween-20). The conjugate was then stored at 4°C until pooling if more than one lot is being manufactured (a.k.a. staging time). After pooling, the final concentration was adjusted to 5.0 mg/mL (±5%) and the drug substance was stored frozen.\n\n\n \n1. Pre-conjugation UF/DF: Removal of Sucrose\n\n\n \n \n \nExperiments were performed to monitor the rate of removal of sucrose during UF/DF by Ellman's assay; and estimate the diavolumes needed to achieve the highest SH-per-Ab ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was found that it is desirable to conduct at least 6 diavolumes in order to remove sucrose to a level that does not impede CR011 reduction. To ensure robustness, at least 10 diavolumes should be utilized during the process.\n\n\n \n2. The Effect of Percent DMSO on Aggregation in the Conjugation Reaction\n\n\n \n \n \nExperiments were performed to determine the effect of DMSO in the conjugation reaction on: (1) aggregation; and (2) drug:Ab molar ratio (i.e. completeness of conjugation).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was found that the percent aggregate in reaction with 12% DMSO was lower than in 15% DMSO, 4.4 and 3.0%, respectively. Formulation pH 9.0 buffer vs. pH 7.0 buffer did not have any effect on aggregation or yield, provided 10% sucrose was included in formulation. The percent aggregate in the 10%, 8%, 6%, and 4% (v/v) DMSO reactions were 2.7, 1.7, 1.0 and 0.5%, respectively. This suggests that CRO11 and CRO11AE were very susceptible to aggregation when a higher percentage of DMSO is present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll four conjugation reactions resulted in a final molar ratio of 4.0 drugs/Ab, suggesting that all four reactions went to completion. Safety margins for DMSO percentage in the conjugation reaction are 4 - 6%. This predicted to yield an aggregation level of 1% or less.\n\n\n \n5. Investigation of Side Reaction During Conjugation of CRO11 to vcMMAE\n\n\n \n \n \nExperiments were performed to: (1) investigate the extent and the kinetics of the side reaction in which maleimide-drug is converted into an unreactive side product, which results in an incomplete conjugation and low drug-loading; (2) determine factors that influence the side reaction; and (3) determine whether the old vcMMAE lot (SGD1006-0-04) differed in reactivity compared to the new lot (SGD1006-0-06).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReactions (100 µl) containing vcMMAE at 30 µM final concentration, were incubated in borate pH 9.0 buffer either in the absence or in the presence of 2-fold molar excess of TCEP (with respect to vcMMAE). The reactions were quenched at 0, 2, 7 or 15 min with excess NAcCys. The control consisted of vcMMAE in phosphate pH 7.0 buffer quenched at the 15 min time point. The chromatograms are shown on \nFigure 23\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \npH\n 7 \nphosphate buffer\n 15 min and in pH 9.0 \nborate buffer\n 0 min after addition of the drug a single Cys-quenched product with (rt = 9.0 min) is formed (Compare A and B). In borate buffer pH 9.0 an unreactive side product is formed (rt=9.2 min) in a time-dependent fashion (B, C, D and E). In borate buffer and in the presence of TCEP (such as CR011 conjugation conditions), formation of the unreactive product is catalyzed resulting in 90% conversion of maleimide into succinimide after only 2 min of incubation (F through I). Both the old vcMMAE lot (SGD-1006-0-06) and the new lot (SGD-1006-0-04) exhibited similar reactivity towards high pH and TCEP, as well as similar kinetics.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 24\n shows the LC-MS identification of the unreactive product as succinimidyl-VCMMAE (rt = 9.2 min, m/z = 1318). \nFigure 25\n shows the relative kinetics of formation of the succinimide in the presence or absence of TCEP.\n\n\n \n\n\nConclusions\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe side product is a result of conjugation performed at \npH\n 9 instead of pH 7.4 (PBS). Formation of the side product is greatly enhanced in the presence of TCEP. The major stable side product has been identified by LC-MS as succinimidyI-vcMMAE. Minor and less stable side-products remain to be identified. Both vcMMAE lots behaved similarly.\n\n\n \n6. Overcoming the Side Reaction During Conjugation of CRO11 to vcMMAE\n\n\n \n \n \nExperiments were performed to investigate whether the side reaction can be overcome by providing a larger excess of the drug for conjugation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral ways to suppress the side reaction were proposed: (1) Conducting conjugation at lower pH, e.g. 8.5 instead of 9.0 (high risk due to reduced solubility of CRO11); (2) Removal of the excess of TCEP by UF/DF (not practical); and (3) Elevation of the excess of VCMMAE added upfront (practical).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n100 mg of CR011 that was previously buffer exchanged into 50 mM borate-50 mM NaCl, was reduced with TCEP to generate 4.35 free thiols per Ab. The reaction was divided into two halves. For the first 50 mg half, a 10% excess of VCMMAE was added based on the 1 drug per thiol ratio . For the second half, a 20% excess was used. The conjugates were purified by UF/DF into 10 \nmM Histidine pH\n 6/10% sucrose solution. The results are summarized in Table 60.\n\n \nTable 60.
