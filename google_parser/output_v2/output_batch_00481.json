Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to methods for inhibiting aggrecanase, in particular ADAMTS5, thereby reducing the break down of aggrecan in cartilage.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nCartilage is an avascular tissue populated by specialized cells termed chondrocytes, which respond to diverse mechanical and biochemical stimuli. Cartilage is present in the linings of joints, interstitial connective tissues, and basement membranes, and is composed of an extracellular matrix comprised of several matrix components including type II collagen, proteoglycans, fibronectin and laminin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn normal cartilage, extracellular matrix synthesis is offset by extracellular matrix degradation, resulting in normal matrix turnover. Depending on the signal(s) received, the ensuing response may be either anabolic (leading to matrix production and/or repair) or catabolic (leading to matrix degradation, cellular apoptosis, loss of function, and pain).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn response to injurious compression and/or exposure to inflammatory mediators (e.g. inflammatory cytokines) chondrocytes decrease matrix production and increase production of multiple matrix degrading enzymes. Examples of matrix degrading enzymes include aggrecanases (ADAMTSs) and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). The activities of these enzymes result in the degradation of the cartilage matrix. Aggrecanases (ADAMTSs), in conjunction with MMPs, degrade aggrecan, an aggregating proteoglycan present in articular cartilage. In osteoarthritic (OA) articular cartilage a loss of proteoglycan staining is observed in the superficial zone in early OA and adjacent to areas of cartilage erosion in moderate to severe OA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAggrecan catabolism as mediated by aggrecanase occurs at certain conserved sites in aggrecan. Human ADAMTS4 (shown in \nFIG. 5\n as SEQ ID NO:44) and ADAMTS5 (shown in \nFIG. 4\n as SEQ ID NO:43) have been shown to cleave aggrecan between amino acids E373 and A374 producing the neoepitope ARGSVIL (SEQ ID NO:1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExcessive degradation of extracellular matrix is implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases and conditions, including pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, sports injuries, erosive arthritis, ankylosing spondylosis, neuralgia, neuropathies, algesia, nerve injury, ischaemia, neurodegeneration, cartilage degeneration, stroke, incontinence, inflammatory disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, periodontal disease, aberrant angiogenesis, tumor invasion and metastasis, corneal ulceration, and in complications of diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, there is a need for compounds capable of inhibiting aggrecanase activity and cartilage degradation.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides isolated polypeptides comprising at least one variable domain capable of binding and/or neutralizing human ADAMTS5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided are isolated polynucleotides encoding the polypeptides of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, provided are pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one polypeptide of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods are provided herein for treating a patient suffering from a disease of the cartilage with a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n: In vitro Inhibition of ARGSVIL (SEQ ID NO:1) Neoepitope Generation by ADAMTS5 mAbs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n: In vitro Concentration Dependent Inhibition of ARGSVIL (SEQ ID NO:1) Neoepitope Generation by 7B4.1E11 Murine mAb\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 3\n: Mean Total Joint Score for Mice Treated with Selected ADAMTS5 Antibodies versus Control In vivo\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 4\n: Amino Acid sequence of human ADAMTS5 (SEQ ID NO:43).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5\n: Amino Acid sequence of Human ADAMTS4 (SEQ ID NO:44).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 6\n: Binding of the humanized anti ADAMTS5 antibodies to recombinant antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 7\n: Binding of the humanized anti ADAMTS5 antibodies to recombinant antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 8\n: Binding of the humanized anti ADAMTS5 antibodies to recombinant antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 9\n: Binding of the humanized anti ADAMTS5 antibodies to recombinant antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 10\n: Percent Inhibition of ADAMTS5 activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 11\n: Percent Inhibition of ADAMTS5 activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 12\n: Binding of the purified anti ADAMTS5 antibodies to recombinant antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 13\n: Structure modeling predicts Ag/Ab interaction sites.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \n“Polynucleotide” generally refers to any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxribonucleotide, which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA. “Polynucleotides” include, without limitation single- and double-stranded DNA, DNA that is a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, single- and double-stranded RNA, and RNA that is mixture of single- and double-stranded regions, hybrid molecules comprising DNA and RNA that may be single-stranded or, more typically, double-stranded or a mixture of single- and double-stranded regions. In addition, “polynucleotide” refers to triple-stranded regions comprising RNA or DNA or both RNA and DNA. The term polynucleotide also includes DNAs or RNAs containing one or more modified bases and DNAs or RNAs with backbones modified for stability or for other reasons. “Modified” bases include, for example, tritylated bases and unusual bases such as inosine. A variety of modifications has been made to DNA and RNA; thus, “polynucleotide” embraces chemically, enzymatically or metabolically modified forms of polynucleotides as typically found in nature, as well as the chemical forms of DNA and RNA characteristic of viruses and cells. “Polynucleotide” also embraces relatively short polynucleotides, often referred to as oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Polypeptide” refers to any peptide or protein comprising two or more amino acids joined to each other by peptide bonds or modified peptide bonds, i.e., peptide isosteres. “Polypeptide” refers to both short chains, commonly referred to as peptides, oligopeptides or oligomers, and to longer chains, generally referred to as proteins. Polypeptides may contain amino acids other than the 20 gene-encoded amino acids. “Polypeptides” include amino acid sequences modified either by natural processes, such as posttranslational processing, or by chemical modification techniques that are well known in the art. Such modifications are well described in basic texts and in more detailed monographs, as well as in a voluminous research literature. Modifications can occur anywhere in a polypeptide, including the peptide backbone, the amino acid side-chains and the amino or carboxyl termini. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given polypeptide. Also, a given polypeptide may contain many types of modifications. Polypeptides may be branched as a result of ubiquitination, and they may be cyclic, with or without branching. Cyclic, branched and branched cyclic polypeptides may result from posttranslation natural processes or may be made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation, acylation, ADP-ribosylation, amidation, covalent attachment of flavin, covalent attachment of a heme moiety, covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative, covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol, cross-linking, cyclization, disulfide bond formation, demethylation, formation of covalent cross-links, formation of cysteine, formation of pyroglutamate, formylation, gamma-carboxylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, hydroxylation, iodination, methylation, myristoylation, oxidation, proteolytic processing, phosphorylation, prenylation, racemization, selenoylation, sulfation, transfer-RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation, and ubiquitination.

Johnson, Ed., Academic Press, New York, 1983; Seifter, et al., “Analysis for protein modifications and nonprotein cofactors”, \nMeth. Enzymol\n.

A typical variant of a polynucleotide differs in nucleotide sequence from another, reference polynucleotide. Changes in the nucleotide sequence of the variant may or may not alter the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide encoded by the reference polynucleotide. Nucleotide changes may result in amino acid substitutions, additions, deletions, fusions and truncations in the polypeptide encoded by the reference sequence, as discussed below. A typical variant of a polypeptide differs in amino acid sequence from another, reference polypeptide. Generally, differences are limited so that the sequences of the reference polypeptide and the variant are closely similar overall and, in many regions, identical. A variant and reference polypeptide may differ in amino acid sequence by one or more substitutions, additions, deletions in any combination. A substituted or inserted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code. A variant of a polynucleotide or polypeptide may be a naturally occurring such as an allelic variant, or it may be a variant that is not known to occur naturally. Non-naturally occurring variants of polynucleotides and polypeptides may be made by mutagenesis techniques or by direct synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Isolated” means altered “by the hand of man” from its natural state, i.e., if it occurs in nature, it has been changed or removed from its original environment, or both. For example, a polynucleotide or a polypeptide naturally present in a living organism is not “isolated,” but the same polynucleotide or polypeptide separated from the coexisting materials of its natural state is “isolated,” including, but not limited to, when such polynucleotide or polypeptide is introduced back into a cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “isolated” or “substantially pure” nucleic acid or polynucleotide (e.g., an RNA, DNA or a mixed polymer) is one which is substantially separated from other cellular components that naturally accompany the native polynucleotide in its natural host cell, e.g., ribosomes, polymerases and genomic sequences with which it is naturally associated. The term embraces a nucleic acid or polynucleotide that (1) has been removed from its naturally occurring environment, (2) is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the “isolated polynucleotide” is found in nature, (3) is operatively linked to a polynucleotide which it is not linked to in nature, or (4) does not occur in nature. The term “isolated” or “substantially pure” also can be used in reference to recombinant or cloned DNA isolates, chemically synthesized polynucleotide analogs, or polynucleotide analogs that are biologically synthesized by heterologous systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, “isolated” does not necessarily require that the nucleic acid or polynucleotide so described has itself been physically removed from its native environment. For instance, an endogenous nucleic acid sequence in the genome of an organism is deemed “isolated” herein if a heterologous sequence is placed adjacent to the endogenous nucleic acid sequence, such that the expression of this endogenous nucleic acid sequence is altered, for example, increased, decreased or eliminated. In this context, a heterologous sequence is a sequence that is not naturally adjacent to the endogenous nucleic acid sequence, whether or not the heterologous sequence is itself endogenous (originating from the same host cell or progeny thereof) or exogenous (originating from a different host cell or progeny thereof). By way of example, a promoter sequence can be substituted (e.g., by homologous recombination) for the native promoter of a gene in the genome of a host cell, such that this gene has an altered expression pattern. This gene would now become “isolated” because it is separated from at least some of the sequences that naturally flank it.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleic acid is also considered “isolated” if it contains any modifications that do not naturally occur to the corresponding nucleic acid in a genome. For instance, an endogenous coding sequence is considered “isolated” if it contains an insertion, deletion or a point mutation introduced artificially, e.g., by human intervention. An “isolated nucleic acid” also includes a nucleic acid integrated into a host cell chromosome at a heterologous site and a nucleic acid construct present as an episome. Moreover, an “isolated nucleic acid” can be substantially free of other cellular material, or substantially free of culture medium when produced by recombinant techniques, or substantially free of chemical precursors or other chemicals when chemically synthesized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “inflammatory mediators” include any compound capable of triggering an inflammatory process. The term inflammation generally refers to the process of reaction of vascularized living tissue to injury. This process includes but is not limited to increased blood flow, increased vascular permeability, and leukocytic exudation. Because leukocytes recruited into inflammatory reactions can release potent enzymes and oxygen free radicals (i.e. inflammatory mediators), the inflammatory response is capable of mediating considerable tissue damage. Examples of inflammatory mediators include, but are not limited to prostaglandins (e.g. PGE2), leukotrienes (e.g. LTB4), inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin 1 (IL-1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6); nitric oxide (NO), metalloproteinases, and heat shock proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “matrix protein” includes proteins released from cells to form the extracellular matrix of cartilage. The extracellular matrix of cartilage consists of proteoglycans, belonging to several distinct proteoglycan families. These include, but are not limited to, perlecan and the hyalectans, exemplified by aggrecan and versican, and the small leucine-rich family of proteoglycans, including decorin, biglycan and fibromodulin. The extracellular matrix also consists of hybrid collagen fibers comprised of three collagen isotypes, namely type II, type IX, and type XI collagens, along with accessory proteins such as cartilage oligeromeric matrix protein (COMP), link protein, and fibronectin. Cartilage also contains hyaluronin which forms a noncovalent association with the hyalectins. In addition, a specialized pericellular matrix surrounds the chondrocyte which consists of proteoglycans, type VI collagen and collagen receptor proteins, such as anchorin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “matrix degrading enzymes” refers to enzymes able to cleave extracellular matrix proteins. Cartilage extracellular matrix turnover is regulated by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) which are synthesized as latent proenzymes that require activation in order to degrade cartilage extracellular matrix proteins. Three classes of enzymes are believed to regulate the turnover of extracellular matrix proteins, namely collagenases (including, but not limited to, MMP-13), responsible for the degradation of native collagen fibers, stromelysins (including, but not limited to, MMP-3) which degrade proteoglycan and type IX collagen, and gelatinases (including, but not limited to, MMP-2 and MMP-9) which degrade denatured collagen. The matrix degrading enzyme group that appears most relevant in cartilage degradation in OA includes a subgroup of metalloproteinases called ADAMTS, because they possess disintegrin and metalloproteinase domains and a thrombospondin motif in their structure. ADAMTS4 (aggrecanase-1) has been reported to be elevated in OA joints and along with ADAMTS-5 (aggrecanase-2) have been shown to be expressed in human osteoarthritic cartilage. These enzymes appear to be responsible for aggrecan degradation without MMP participation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “reduce” or “reducing” aggrecanase activity refers to a decrease in any and/or all of the activities associated with at least one naturally occurring aggrecanase, including but not limited to ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5. For example “reducing” at least one ADAMTS5 activity refers to a decrease in any and/or all of the activities associated with naturally occurring ADAMTS5. By way of example, reducing ADAMTS5 in a mammal activity can be measured after administration of at least one polypeptide capable of binding to ADAMTS5 to a subject and compared with ADAMTS5 activity in the same subject prior to the administration of the polypeptide capable of binding to ADAMTS5 or in comparison to a second subject who is administered placebo. As used herein, “reducing” at least one ADAMTS5 includes the reduction of at least one or more enzyme activity. A reduction in at least one ADAMTS5 activity includes a complete abrogation of at least one ADAMTS5. Also included within this definition is a reduced amount of at least one enzyme activity. That is, ADAMTS5 may have more than one activity which is maintained the while a second activity of the same enzyme is reduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “diseases associated with cartilage degradation” include, but are not limited to cancer, pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, osteoarthritis, sports injuries, erosive arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Lyme arthritis, juvenile arthritis, ankylosing spondylosis, neuralgia, neuropathies, algesia, nerve injury, ischaemia, neurodegeneration, inflammatory diseases, cartilage degeneration, diseases affecting the larynx, trachea, auditory canal, intervertebral discs, ligaments, tendons, joint capsules or bone development, invertebral disc degeneration, osteopenia, or periodontal diseases, acute joint injury, and/or a disease related to joint destruction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “co-administration” or “co-administering” as used herein refers to administration of two or more compounds to the same patient. Co-administration of such compounds may be simultaneous or at about the same time (e.g., within the same hour) or it may be within several hours or days of one another. For example, a first compound may be administered once weekly while a second compound is co-administered daily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein “attenuate” or “attenuating” refers to a normalization (i.e., either an increase or decrease) of the amount of matrix degrading enzyme, inflammatory mediator, or matrix protein produced and/or released by a cell, following exposure to a catabolic stimulus. For example, following exposure to IL-1 chondrocyte production of matrix proteins, such as proteoglycans, are reduced, while production of matrix degrading enzymes (e.g. MMP-13, ADAMTS4) and reactive oxygen species (e.g. NO) are increased. Attenuation refers to the normalization of these diverse responses to levels observed in the absence of a catabolic stimulus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “domain antibody” or “dAb” may be considered the same as a “single variable domain” which is capable of binding to an antigen. A single variable domain may be a human antibody variable domain, but also includes single antibody variable domains from other species such as rodent (for example, as disclosed in WO 00/29004), nurse shark and Camelid VHH dAbs. Camelid VHH are immunoglobulin single variable domain polypeptides that are derived from species including camel, llama, alpaca, dromedary, and guanaco, which produce heavy chain antibodies naturally devoid of light chains. Such VHH domains may be humanized according to standard techniques available in the art, and such domains are considered to be “domain antibodies.” As used herein VH includes camelid VHH domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “single variable domain” refers to an antigen binding protein variable domain (for example, V\nH\n, V\nHH\n, V\nL\n) that specifically binds an antigen or epitope independently of a different variable region or domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antigen binding protein” as used herein refers to antibodies, antibody fragments and other protein constructs, such as domains, but not limited to, variable domains and domain antibodies, which are capable of binding to an antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antigen binding domain of an antibody comprises two separate regions: a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) and a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n: which can be either V\nκ\n or V\nλ\n). The antigen binding site itself is formed by six polypeptide loops: three from V\nH \ndomain (H1, H2 and H3) and three from V\nL \ndomain (L1, L2 and L3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis of the structures and sequences of antibodies has shown that five of the six antigen binding loops (H1, H2, L1, L2, L3) possess a limited number of main-chain conformations or canonical structures (Chothia and Lesk (1987) \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n196: 901; Chothia et al. (1989) \nNature, \n342: 877). The main-chain conformations are determined by (i) the length of the antigen binding loop, and (ii) particular residues, or types of residue, at certain key position in the antigen binding loop and the antibody framework. Analysis of the loop lengths and key residues has enabled us to the predict the main-chain conformations of H1, H2, L1, L2 and L3 encoded by the majority of human antibody sequences (Chothia et al. (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n227: 799; Tomlinson et al. (1995) \nEMBO J., \n14: 4628; Williams et al. (1996) \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n264: 220). Although the H3 region is much more diverse in terms of sequence, length and structure (due to the use of D segments), it also forms a limited number of main-chain conformations for short loop lengths which depend on the length and the presence of particular residues, or types of residue, at key positions in the loop and the antibody framework (Martin et al. (1996) \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n263: 800; Shirai et al. (1996) \nFEBS Letters, \n399:1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies comprising complementary pairs of V\nH \nand V\nL \nregions are known in the art. These bispecific antibodies must comprise two pairs of V\nH \nand V\nL\ns, each V\nH\n/V\nL \npair binding to a single antigen or epitope. Methods described involve hybrid hybridomas (Milstein & Cuello AC, Nature 305:537-40), minibodies (Hu et al., (1996) Cancer Res 56:3055-3061;), diabodies (Holliger et al., (1993) Proc. Natl. \nAcad. Sci. USA\n 90, 6444-6448; WO 94/13804), chelating recombinant antibodies (CRAbs; Neri et al., (1995) J. Mol. Biol. 246, 367-373), biscFv (e.g. Atwell et al., (1996) Mol. Immunol. 33, 1301-1312), “knobs in holes” stabilized antibodies (Carter et al., (1997) Protein Sci. 6, 781-788). In each case each antibody species comprises two antigen-binding sites, each fashioned by a complementary pair of V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains. Each antibody is thereby able to bind to two different antigens or epitopes at the same time, with the binding to EACH antigen or epitope mediated by a V\nH \nand its complementary V\nL \ndomain. Each of these techniques presents its particular disadvantages; for instance in the case of hybrid hybridomas, inactive V\nH\n/V\nL \npairs can greatly reduce the fraction of bispecific IgG. Furthermore, most bispecific approaches rely on the association of the different V\nH\n/V\nL \npairs or the association of V\nH \nand V\nL \nchains to recreate the two different V\nH\n/V\nL \nbinding sites. It is therefore impossible to control the ratio of binding sites to each antigen or epitope in the assembled molecule and thus many of the assembled molecules will bind to one antigen or epitope but not the other. In some cases it has been possible to engineer the heavy or light chains at the sub-unit interfaces (Carter et al., 1997) in order to improve the number of molecules which have binding sites to both antigens or epitopes but this never results in all molecules having binding to both antigens or epitopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is some evidence that two different antibody binding specificities might be incorporated into the same binding site, but these generally represent two or more specificities that correspond to structurally related antigens or epitopes or to antibodies that are broadly cross-reactive. For example, cross-reactive antibodies have been described, usually where the two antigens are related in sequence and structure, such as hen egg white lysozyme and turkey lysozyme (McCafferty et al., WO 92/01047) or to free hapten and to hapten conjugated to carrier (Griffiths AD et al. \nEMBO J \n1994 13:14 3245-60). In a further example, WO 02/02773 (Abbott Laboratories) describes antibody molecules with “dual specificity.” The antibody molecules referred to are antibodies raised or selected against multiple antigens, such that their specificity spans more than a single antigen. Each complementary V\nH\n/V\nL \npair in the antibodies of WO 02/02773 specifies a single binding specificity for two or more structurally related antigens; the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains in such complementary pairs do not each possess a separate specificity. The antibodies thus have a broad single specificity which encompasses two antigens, which are structurally related. Furthermore natural autoantibodies have been described that are polyreactive (Casali & Notkins, Ann. Rev. Immunol. 7, 515-531), reacting with at least two (usually more) different antigens or epitopes that are not structurally related. It has also been shown that selections of random peptide repertoires using phage display technology on a monoclonal antibody will identify a range of peptide sequences that fit the antigen binding site. Some of the sequences are highly related, fitting a consensus sequence, whereas others are very different and have been termed mimotopes (Lane & Stephen, Current Opinion in Immunology, 1993, 5, 268-271). It is therefore clear that a natural four-chain antibody, comprising associated and complementary V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains, has the potential to bind to many different antigens from a large universe of known antigens. It is less clear how to create a binding site to two given antigens in the same antibody, particularly those which are not necessarily structurally related.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein engineering methods have been suggested that may have a bearing on this. For example it has also been proposed that a catalytic antibody could be created with a binding activity to a metal ion through one variable domain, and to a hapten (substrate) through contacts with the metal ion and a complementary variable domain (Barbas et al., 1993 Proc. Natl. \nAcad. Sci USA\n 90, 6385-6389). However in this case, the binding and catalysis of the substrate (first antigen) is proposed to require the binding of the metal ion (second antigen). Thus the binding to the V\nH\n/V\nL \npairing relates to a single but multi-component antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods have been described for the creation of bispecific antibodies from camel antibody heavy chain single domains in which binding contacts for one antigen are created in one variable domain, and for a second antigen in a second immunoglobulin variable domain. However the variable domains were not complementary. Thus a first heavy chain variable domain is selected against a first antigen, and a second heavy chain variable domain against a second antigen, and then both domains are linked together on the same chain to give a bispecific antibody fragment (Conrath et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n270, 27589-27594). However the camel heavy chain single domains are unusual in that they are derived from natural camel antibodies which have no light chains, and indeed the heavy chain single domains are unable to associate with camel light chains to form complementary V\nH \nand V\nL \npairs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle heavy chain variable domains have also been described, derived from natural antibodies which are normally associated with light chains (from monoclonal antibodies or from repertoires of domains; see EP-A-0368684). These heavy chain variable domains have been shown to interact specifically with one or more related antigens but have not been combined with other heavy or light chain variable domains to create a ligand with a specificity for two or more different antigens. Furthermore, these single domains have been shown to have a very short in vivo half-life. Therefore such domains are of limited therapeutic value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been suggested to make bispecific antibody fragments by linking heavy chain variable domains of different specificity together (as described above). The disadvantage with this approach is that isolated antibody variable domains may have a hydrophobic interface that normally makes interactions with the light chain and is exposed to solvent and may be “sticky” allowing the single domain to bind to hydrophobic surfaces. Furthermore, in the absence of a partner light chain the combination of two or more different heavy chain variable domains and their association, possibly via their hydrophobic interfaces, may prevent them from binding to one in not both of the ligands they are able to bind in isolation. Moreover, in this case the heavy chain variable domains would not be associated with complementary light chain variable domains and thus may be less stable and readily unfold (Worn & Pluckthun, 1998 Biochemistry 37, 13120-7).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “antibody” includes immunoglobulin molecules comprising four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as V\nH\n) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as V\nL\n) and a light chain constant region. The light chains of antibodies (immunoglobulins) from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (κ) and lambda (λ), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. The variable regions of kappa light chains are referred to herein as VK. The expression V\nL\n, as used herein, is intended to include both the variable regions from kappa-type light chains (VK) and from lambda-type light chains. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The V\nH \nand V\nL \nregions include regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FR). Each V\nH \nand V\nL \nis composed of three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino-terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1-CDR1-FR2-CDR2-FR3-CDR3-FR4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains, antibodies can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called α, δ, ε, γ, and μ, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. The present invention includes antibodies of any of the aforementioned classes or subclasses (isotypes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antibody” as used herein is also intended to encompass antibodies, digestion fragments, specified portions and variants thereof, including antibody mimetics or comprising portions of antibodies that mimic the structure and/or function of an antibody or specified fragment or portion thereof, including single chain antibodies and fragments thereof; each containing at least one CDR. Functional fragments include antigen binding fragments that bind to an ADAMTS5 antigen. For example, antibody fragments capable of binding to ADAMTS5or a portion thereof, including, but not limited to Fab (e.g., by papain digestion), facb (e.g., by plasmin digestion), pFc′ (e.g., by pepsin or plasmin digestion), Fd (e.g., by pepsin digestion, partial reduction and reaggregation), Fv or scFv (e.g., by molecular biology techniques) fragments, are encompassed by the present invention. Antibody fragments are also intended to include, e.g., domain deleted antibodies, diabodies, linear antibodies, single-chain antibody molecules, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody,” as used herein, refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, e.g., the individual antibodies comprising the population are substantially identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations or minor post-translational variations that may be present. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. The monoclonal antibodies of the present invention are preferably made by recombinant DNA methods or are obtained by screening methods as described elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibodies,” as used herein, includes “chimeric” antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species (e.g., mouse or rat) or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (Morrison et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81:6851-6855 (1984)). Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include “primatized” antibodies comprising variable domain antigen-binding sequences derived from a non-human primate (e.g., Old World Monkey, such as baboon, rhesus or cynomolgus monkey) and human constant region sequences (U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,780).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present invention includes, for example, chimeric monoclonal antibodies comprising a chimeric heavy chain and/or a chimeric light chain. The chimeric heavy chain may comprise any of the heavy chain variable (V\nH\n) regions described herein or mutants or variants thereof fused to a heavy chain constant region of a non-human or a human antibody. The chimeric light chain may comprise any of the light chain variable (V\nL\n) regions described herein or mutants or variants thereof fused to a light chain constant region of a non-human or a human antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “human antibody,” as used herein, includes antibodies having variable and constant regions corresponding to human germline immunoglobulin sequences as described by Kabat et al. (See Kabat, et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242). The human antibodies of the invention may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo), for example in the CDRs and in particular CDR3. The human antibody can have at least one position replaced with an amino acid residue, e.g., an activity enhancing amino acid residue which is not encoded by the human germline immunoglobulin sequence. In the context of the present invention, the human antibody can have up to twenty positions replaced with amino acid residues which are not part of the human germline immunoglobulin sequence. In other embodiments, up to ten, up to five, up to three or up to two positions are replaced. However, the term “human antibody,” as used herein, is not intended to include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “recombinant human antibody” includes human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies expressed using a recombinant expression vector transfected into a host cell, antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial human antibody library, antibodies isolated from an animal that is transgenic for human immunoglobulin genes, or antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involves splicing of human immunoglobulin gene sequences to other DNA sequences. Such recombinant human antibodies have variable and constant regions derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences (See Kabat, E. A., et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH Publication No. 91-3242). According to the present invention, recombinant human antibodies include human germline immunoglobulin sequence that have been subjected to in vitro mutagenesis (or, when an animal transgenic for human Ig sequences is used, in vivo somatic mutagenesis) and thus the amino acid sequences of the V\nH \nand V\nL \nregions of the recombinant antibodies are sequences that, while derived from and related to human germline V\nH \nand V\nL \nsequences, may not naturally exist within the human antibody germline repertoire in vivo. In certain embodiments, however, such recombinant antibodies are the result of selective mutagenesis approach or backmutation or both.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention may be isolated antibodies. An “isolated antibody,” as used herein, includes an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities. Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntact antibodies include heteromultimeric glycoproteins comprising at least two heavy and two light chains. Aside from IgM, intact antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of approximately 150 Kda, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Typically, each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the number of disulfide linkages between the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes varies. Each heavy and light chain also has intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain (V\nH\n) followed by a number of constant regions. Each light chain has a variable domain (V\nL\n) and a constant region at its other end; the constant region of the light chain is aligned with the first constant region of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. The light chains of antibodies from most vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two types called Kappa and Lambda based on the amino acid sequence of the constant region. Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant region of their heavy chains, human antibodies can be assigned to five different classes, IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM. IgG and IgA can be further subdivided into subclasses, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4; and IgA1 and IgA2. Species variants exist with mouse and rat having at least IgG2a, IgG2b. The variable domain of the antibody confers binding specificity upon the antibody with certain regions displaying particular variability called complementarity determining regions (CDRs). The more conserved portions of the variable region are called Framework regions (FR). The variable domains of intact heavy and light chains each comprise four FR connected by three CDRs. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies. The constant regions are not directly involved in the binding of the antibody to the antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation in antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis via binding to Fcγ receptor, half-life/clearance rate via neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and complement dependent cytotoxicity via the C1C1q C1qq component of the complement cascade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman antibodies may be produced by a number of methods known to those of skill in the art. Human antibodies can be made by the hybridoma method using human myeloma or mouse-human heteromyeloma cells lines see Kozbor J.Immunol 133, 3001, (1984) and Brodeur, \nMonoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications\n, pp51-63 (Marcel Dekker Inc, 1987). Alternative methods include the use of phage libraries or transgenic mice both of which utilize human V region repertories (see Winter G, (1994), Annu Rev.Immunol 12,433-455, Green L L (1999), J.Immunol.methods 231, 11-23).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral strains of transgenic mice are now available wherein their mouse immunoglobulin loci has been replaced with human immunoglobulin gene segments (see Tomizuka K, (2000) PNAS 97,722-727; Fishwild D. M (1996) Nature Biotechnol. 14,845-851, Mendez M J, 1997, Nature Genetics, 15,146-156). Upon antigen challenge such mice are capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies from which antibodies of interest can be selected. Of particular note is the Trimera™ system (see Eren R et al, (1998) Immunology 93:154-161) where human lymphocytes are transplanted into irradiated mice, the Selected Lymphocyte Antibody System (SLAM, see Babcook et al, PNAS (1996) 93:7843-7848) where human (or other species) lymphocytes are effectively put through a massive pooled in vitro antibody generation procedure followed by deconvulated, limiting dilution and selection procedure and the Xenomouse II™ (Abgenix Inc). An alternative approach is available from Morphotek Inc using the Morphodoma™ technology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPhage display technology can be used to produce human antibodies (and fragments thereof), see McCafferty; Nature, 348, 552-553 (1990) and Griffiths AD et at (1994) EMBO 13:3245-3260. According to this technique antibody V domain genes are cloned in frame into either a major or minor coat of protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage such as M13 or fd and displayed (usually with the aid of a helper phage) as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Selections based on the functional properties of the antibody result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. The phage display technique can be used to select antigen specific antibodies from libraries made from human B cells taken from individuals afflicted with a disease or disorder described above or alternatively from unimmunized human donors (see Marks; J. Mol. Bio. 222,581-597, 1991). Where an intact human antibody is desired comprising a Fc domain it is necessary to redone the phage displayed derived fragment into a mammalian expression vectors comprising the desired constant regions and establishing stable expressing cell lines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe technique of affinity maturation (Marks; Bio/technol 10,779-783 (1992)) may be used to improve binding affinity wherein the affinity of the primary human antibody is improved by sequentially replacing the H and L chain V regions with naturally occurring variants and selecting on the basis of improved binding affinities. Variants of this technique such as “epitope imprinting” are now also available see WO 93/06213. See also Waterhouse; Nucl.Acids Res 21, 2265-2266 (1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the antigen binding proteins of the present invention have an affinity of at least about 5×10\n4 \nliter/mole, 1×10\n5 \nliter/mole, 5×10\n5 \nliter/mole, or 1×10\n6 \nliter/mole as measured by an association constant (Ka). In another embodiment, the antigen binding proteins of the present invention binds to a neutralizing epitope of human ADAMTS5 with a dissociation constant (Kd) of less than about 5×10\n−4 \nliter/second, 1×10\n−5 \nliter/second, 5×10\n−5 \nliter/second, or 1×10\n−6 \nliter/second.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of intact non-human antibodies in the treatment of human diseases or disorders carries with it the potential for the now well established problems of immunogenicity, which is the immune system of the patient may recognize the non-human intact antibody as non-self and mount a neutralizing response. This reaction is particularly evident upon multiple administration of the non-human antibody to a human patient. Various techniques have been developed over the years to overcome these problems and generally involve reducing the composition of non-human amino acid sequences in the intact antibody whilst retaining the relative ease in obtaining non-human antibodies from an immunized animal e.g. mouse, rat or rabbit. Broadly two approaches have been used to achieve this. The first are chimeric antibodies, which generally comprise a non-human (e.g. rodent such as mouse) variable domain fused to a human constant region. Because the antigen-binding site of an antibody is localized within the variable regions the chimeric antibody retains its binding affinity for the antigen but acquires the effector functions of the human constant region and are therefore able to perform effector functions such as described supra. Chimeric antibodies are typically produced using recombinant DNA methods. DNA encoding the antibodies (e.g. cDNA) is isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the H and L chains of the antibody of the invention, e.g. DNA encoding \nSEQ.I.D.NO\n 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 described supra). Hybridoma cells serve as a typical source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA is placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as \nE. coli\n, COS cells, CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein to obtain synthesis of the antibody. The DNA may be modified by substituting the coding sequence for human L and H chains for the corresponding non-human (e.g. murine) H and L constant regions see e.g. Morrison; PNAS 81, 6851 (1984).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe second approach involves the generation of humanized antibodies wherein the non-human content of the antibody is reduced by humanizing the variable regions. Humanized antibodies can be made by CDR grafting. CDRs build loops close to the antibody's N-terminus where they form a surface mounted in a scaffold provided by the framework regions. Antigen-binding specificity of the antibody is mainly defined by the topography and by the chemical characteristics of its CDR surface. These features are in turn determined by the conformation of the individual CDRs, by the relative disposition of the CDRs, and by the nature and disposition of the side chains of the residues comprising the CDRs. A large decrease in immunogenicity can be achieved by grafting only the CDRs of a non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies (“donor” antibodies) onto human framework (“acceptor framework”) and constant regions (see Jones et at (1986) Nature 321,522-525 and Verhoeyen M et at (1988) Science 239, 1534-1536). However, CDR grafting per se may not result in the complete retention of antigen-binding properties and it is frequently found that some framework residues (sometimes referred to as “back-mutations”) of the donor antibody need to be preserved in the humanized molecule if significant antigen-binding affinity is to be recovered (see Queen C et at (1989) PNAS 86, 10,029-10,033, Co, M et al (1991) Nature 351, 501-502). In this case, human V regions showing the greatest sequence homology to the non-human donor antibody are chosen from a database in order to provide the human framework (FR). The selection of human FRs can be made either from human consensus or individual human antibodies. Where necessary key residues from the donor antibody are substituted into the human acceptor framework to preserve CDR conformations. Computer modeling of the antibody maybe used to help identify such structurally important residues, see WO99/48523.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, humanization may be achieved by a process of “veneering.” A statistical analysis of unique human and murine immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable regions revealed that the precise patterns of exposed residues are different in human and murine antibodies, and most individual surface positions have a strong preference for a small number of different residues (see Padlan E. A. et al; (1991) Mol.Immuno1.28, 489-498 and Pedersen J. T. et at (1994) J.Mol.Biol. 235; 959-973). Therefore it is possible to reduce the immunogenicity of a non-human Fv by replacing exposed residues in its framework regions that differ from those usually found in human antibodies. Because protein antigenicity may be correlated with surface accessibility, replacement of the surface residues may be sufficient to render the mouse variable region “invisible” to the human immune system (see also Mark G. E. et at (1994) in \nHandbook of Experimental Pharmacology vol\n.113: \nThe pharmacology of monoclonal Antibodies\n, Springer-Verlag, pp105-134). This procedure of humanization is referred to as “veneering” because only the surface of the antibody is altered, the supporting residues remain undisturbed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present invention provides isolated antigen binding proteins, comprising at least one first immunoglobulin variable domain capable of binding to an aggrecanase.

The particular canonical structure class of a CDR is defined by both the length of the CDR and by the loop packing, determined by residues located at key positions in both the CDRs and the framework regions (structurally determining residues or SDRs). Martin and Thornton (1996; J Mol Biol 263:800-815) have generated an automatic method to define the “key residue” canonical templates. Cluster analysis is used to define the canonical classes for sets of CDRs, and canonical templates are then identified by analysing buried hydrophobics, hydrogen-bonding residues, and conserved glycines and prolines. The CDRs of antibody sequences can be assigned to canonical classes by comparing the sequences to the key residue templates and scoring each template using identity or similarity matrices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of CDR canonicals within the scope of the invention are given below.

MMP-2 is believed to contribute to joint destruction in paws of arthritic mice. In vitro studies indicate that VIP may act directly on synoviocytes, although an indirect action could also be mediated through enhanced production of Th2 cytokines Nonetheless, VIP appears to affect synovial function at multiple levels in the CIA mouse model. The peptide suppresses Thl function and but increases Th2 function, possibly ‘rebalancing’ the immune system. Moreover, VIP has direct and indirect effects on macrophages and synoviocytes, leading to decreased expression of IL-1, TNF-α, chemokines and matrix-degrading enzymes, protecting joint integrity.

Hindlimb weight bearing was used as a measure of joint pain, while von Frey hair algesiometry applied to the plantar surface of the ipsilateral hindpaw tested for secondary mechanical hyperalgesia. Intra-articular injection of VIP into normal rat knee joints caused a significant shift in weight bearing in favor of the contralateral non-injected hindlimb as well as causing a reduction in ipsilateral paw withdrawal threshold. These pain responses were blocked by co-administration of a VPAC receptor antagonist. Antagonists that inhibit VIP activity may prove beneficial in the alleviation of OA pain. McDougall, et al. \nPain \n2006 Jul;123(1-2):98-105.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNerve growth factor (NGF) was the first neurotrophin to be identified, and its role in the development and survival of both peripheral and central neurons has been well characterized. NGF has been shown to be a critical survival and maintenance factor in the development of peripheral sympathetic and embryonic sensory neurons and of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. Smeyne et al., \nNature \n368:246-249 (1994) and Crowley et al., \nCell \n76:1001-1011 (1994). NGF up-regulates expression of neuropeptides in sensory neurons (Lindsay and Harmer, \nNature \n337:362-364 (1989)) and its activity is mediated through two different membrane-bound receptors, the TrkA receptor and the p75 common neurotrophin receptor (sometimes termed “high affinity” and “low affinity” NGF receptors, respectively). Chao et al., Science 232:518-521 (1986). For review on NGF, see Huang et al., Annu Rev. Neurosci. 24:677-736 (2001); Bibel et al., Genes Dev. 14:2919-2937 (2000). The crystal structure of NGF and NGF in complex with the trkA receptor have been determined. See Nature 254:411 (1991); Nature 401:184-188 (1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOncostatin M is a 28 KDa glycoprotein that belongs to the interleukin 6 (IL-6) family of cytokines which includes IL-6, Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotropin-1 (CT-1) and cardiotrophin-1 like cytokine (See Kishimoto T et al (1995) Blood 86: 1243-1254), which share the gp130 transmembrane signalling receptor (See Taga T and Kishimoto T (1997) Annu Rev. Immunol. 15: 797-819). OSM was originally discovered by its ability to inhibit the growth of the melanoma cell line A375 (See Malik N (1989) et al Mol Cell Biol 9: 2847-2853). Subsequently, more effects were discovered and it was found to be a multifunctional mediator like other members of the IL-6 family. OSM is produced in a variety of cell types including macrophages, activated T cells (See Zarling J M (1986) PNAS (USA) 83: 9739-9743), polymorphonuclear neutrophils (See Grenier A et al (1999) Blood 93:1413-1421), eosinophils (See Tamura S et al (2002) Dev. Dyn. 225: 327-31), dendritic cells (See Suda T et al (2002) Cytokine 17:335-340). It is also expressed in pancreas, kidney, testes, spleen stomach and brain (See Znoyko I et al (2005) Anat Rec A Discov Mol Cell Evol Biol 283: 182-186), and bone marrow (See Psenak 0 et al (2003) Acta Haematol 109: 68-75) Its principle biological effects include activation of endothelium (See Brown T J et al (1993) Blood 82: 33-7), activation of the acute phase response (See Benigni F et al (1996) Blood 87: 1851-1854), induction of cellular proliferation or differentiation, modulation of inflammatory mediator release and haematopoesis (See Tanaka M et al (2003) 102: 3154-3162), re-modelling of bone (See de Hooge ASK (2002) Am J Pathol 160: 1733-1743) and, promotion of angiogenesis (See Vasse M et al (1999) Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol 19:1835-1842) and wound healing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cytokine known as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα; also termed cachectin) is a protein secreted primarily by monocytes and macrophages in response to endotoxin or other stimuli as a soluble homotrimer of 17 kD protein subunits (Smith, R. A. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 262:6951-6954 (1987)). A membrane-bound 26 kD precursor form of TNF has also been described (Kriegler, M. et al., Cell 53:45-53 (1988)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccumulating evidence indicates that TNF is a regulatory cytokine with pleiotropic biological activities. These activities include: inhibition of lipoprotein lipase synthesis (“cachectin” activity) (Beutler, B. et al., Nature 316:552 (1985)), activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Klebanoff, S. J. et al., J. Immunol. 136:4220 (1986); Perussia, B., et al., J. Immunol. 138:765 (1987)), inhibition of cell growth or stimulation of cell growth (Vilcek, J. et al., J. Exp. Med. 163:632 (1986); Sugarman, B. J. et al., Science 230:943 (1985); Lachman, L. B. et al., J. Immunol. 138:2913 (1987)), cytotoxic action on certain transformed cell types (Lachman, L. B. et al., supra; Darzynkiewicz, Z. et al., Canc. Res. 44:83 (1984)), antiviral activity (Kohase, M. et al., Cell 45:659 (1986); Wong, G. H. W. et al., Nature 323:819 (1986)), stimulation of bone resorption (Bertolini, D. R. et al., Nature 319:516 (1986); Saklatvala, J., Nature 322:547 (1986)), stimulation of collagenase and prostaglandin E2 production (Dayer, J.-M. et al., J. Exp. Med. 162:2163 (1985)); and immunoregulatory actions, including activation of T cells (Yokota, S. et al., J. Immunol. 140:531 (1988)), B cells (Kehrl, J. H. et al., J. Exp. Med. 166:786 (1987)), monocytes (Philip, R. et al., Nature 323:86 (1986)), thymocytes (Ranges, G. E. et al., J. Exp. Med. 167:1472 (1988)), and stimulation of the cell-surface expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules (Collins, T. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:446 (1986); Pujol-Borrel, R. et al., Nature 326:304 (1987)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterleukin-6 (IL-6) is a 22 to 27 kDa secreted glycoprotein which exhibits growth stimulatory and proimflammatory activities. IL-6 is also known as interferon-β2 (IFN-Jβ2), IL-1 inducible 26-kDa protein, hepatocyte-stimulating factor, cytotoxic T-cell differentiation factor, and B-cell stimulatory factor. (Trikha et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 9:4653-4665 (2003)). IL-6 is secreted by various cell types. IL-6 exerts its activities through binding to a high-affinity receptor complex consisting of two membrane glycoproteins: an 80 kDa component receptor that binds IL-6 with low affinity (IL-6R) and a signal-transducing component of 130 kDa (gp130) that does not bind IL-6 by itself, but is required for high-affinity binding of IL-6 by the complex. IL-6R can be cleaved by a transmembrane metalloproteinase to yield the soluble IL-6R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRANK is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily; it most closely resembles CD40 in the extracellular region. Similar to CD40, RANK associates with TRAF2 and TRAF3 (as determined by co-immunoprecipitation assays substantially as described by Rothe et al., Cell 83:1243, 1995). TRAFs are critically important in the regulation of the immune and inflammatory response. Through their association with various members of the TNF receptor superfamily, a signal is transduced to a cell. That signal results in the proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis of the cell, depending on which receptor(s) is/are triggered and which TRAF(s) associate with the receptor(s); different signals can be transduced to a cell via coordination of various signaling events. Thus, a signal transduced through one member of this family may be proliferative, differentiative or apoptotic, depending on other signals being transduced to the cell, and/or the state of differentiation of the cell. Such exquisite regulation of this proliferative/apoptotic pathway is necessary to develop and maintain protection against pathogens; imbalances can result in autoimmune disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRANK is expressed on epithelial cells, some B cell lines, and on activated T cells. However, its expression on activated T cells is late, about four days after activation. This time course of expression coincides with the expression of Fas, a known agent of apoptosis. RANK may act as an anti-apoptotic signal, rescuing cells that express RANK from apoptosis as CD40 is known to do. Alternatively, RANK may confirm an apoptotic signal under the appropriate circumstances, again similar to CD40. RANK and its ligand are likely to play an integral role in regulation of the immune and inflammatory response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ligand, which is referred to as RANKL, is a \nType\n 2 transmembrane protein with an intracellular domain of less than about 50 amino acids, a transmembrane domain and an extracellular domain of from about 240 to 250 amino acids. Similar to other members of the TNF family to which it belongs, RANKL has a ‘spacer’ region between the transmembrane domain and the receptor binding domain that is not necessary for receptor binding. Accordingly, soluble forms of RANKL can comprise the entire extracellular domain or fragments thereof that include the receptor binding region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTRPV4 channel receptor is one of six known members of the vanilloid family of transient receptor potential channels and shares 51% identity at the nucleotide level with \nTRPV\n 1, the capsaicin receptor. Examples of polypeptides and polynucleotides encoding forms of human vanniloid receptors, including TRPV4 channel receptor from human, can be found in EP 1170365 as well as WO 00/32766. Like the other family members, TRPV4 channel receptor is a Ca2+ permeable, non-selective, ligand-gated cation channel, which is responsive to diverse stimuli such as reduced osmolality, elevated temperature, and small molecule ligands. See, for instance, Voets, et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2002) 277 33704-47051; Watanabe, et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2002) 277:47044-47051; Watanabe, et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2002) 277: 13569-47051; Xu, et al., J. Biol. Chem. (2003) 278:11520-11527. From a screen of body tissues, the human TRPV4 channel receptor is most prominently expressed in cartilage. A screen of primary and clonal cell cultures shows significant expression only in chondrocytes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch responses are also evoked by structural analogues of capsaicin that share a common vanilloid moiety. One such analogue is resiniferatoxin (RTX), a natural product of Euphorbia plants. The term vanilloid receptor (VR) was coined to describe the neuronal membrane recognition site for capsaicin and such related irritant compounds. The capsaicin response is competitively inhibited (and thereby antagonized) by another capsaicin analog, capsazepine, and is also inhibited by the non-selective cation channel blocker ruthenium red. These antagonists bind to VR with no more than moderate affinity (typically with K\ni \nvalues of no lower than 140 μM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, rat and human receptors for capsaicin were cloned from dorsal root ganglion cells. Such receptors have also been referred to as VR1, and the terms “VR1” and “capsaicin receptor” are used interchangeably herein to refer to rat and/or human receptors of this type, as well as mammalian homologs. The role of VR1 in pain sensation has been confirmed using mice lacking this receptor, which exhibit no vanilloid-evoked pain behavior, and impaired responses to heat and inflammation. The capsaicin receptor is a nonselective cation channel with a threshold for opening that is lowered in response to elevated temperatures, low pH, and capsaicin receptor agonists. For example, the channel usually opens at temperatures higher than about 45° C. Opening of the capsaicin receptor channel is generally followed by the release of inflammatory peptides from neurons expressing the receptor and other nearby neurons, increasing the pain response. After initial activation by capsaicin, the capsaicin receptor undergoes a rapid desensitization via phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antigen binding protein of the present invention can be characterized by a dissociation constant equal or less than about 9.0×10\n−9 \nM for human ADAMTS5, in some instances it is less than or equal to about 2.5×10\n−10 \nM. Antigen binding protein affinity for a target such as human ADAMTS5 can be measured by surface plasmon resonance such as but not limited to BIACORE or Octet. BIAcore kinetic analysis can be used to determine the binding on and off rates of antibodies or fragments thereof to a ADAMTS5 antigen. BIAcore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of a ADAMTS5 antigen from chips with immobilized antibodies or fragments thereof on their surface (see the Example section infra).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides antigen binding proteins that block and/or reduce at least one activity ADAMTS5. In some instances, the antigen binding proteins of the present invention blocks and/or reduces the cleavage of aggrecan by ADAMTS5 at the Glu\n373\n-Ala\n374 \ncleavage site. In some aspects, the antigen binding proteins of the present invention are capable of penetrating cartilage, even when administered by a non-articular route of administration. For instance, the antigen binding proteins of the present invention may be administered intravenously, intramuscularly, intraarticularly, subcutaneously, orally, intranasally, and/or by peritoneal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided in the present invention are isolated polynucleotides encoding an antigen binding protein of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolated polynucleotide encodes an antigen binding protein or a fragment thereof comprising an antibody V\nH \ndomain comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 76, 80, 116, 118, 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 136, 138, 140, 142, and 144. In one embodiment the isolated polynucleotide is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 75, 79, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, and 159. In one embodiment the polypeptide is an antibody produced from a cell expressing a polynucleotide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 75, 79, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125, 127, 135, 137, 139, 141, 143, and 159.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolated polynucleotide encodes an antigen binding protein or a fragment thereof comprising an antibody V\nL \ndomain comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 78, 82, 130, 132, 134, and 146. In one embodiment the isolated polynucleotide is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 77, 81, 129, 131, 133, and 145. In one embodiment the polypeptide is an antibody produced from a cell expressing a polynucleotide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 77, 81, 129, 131, 133, and 145.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolated polynucleotide encodes an antigen binding protein or a fragment thereof comprising an antibody heavy chain comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 68, 72, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, and 158. In one embodiment the isolated polynucleotide is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 67, 71, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, and 159. In one embodiment the polypeptide is an antibody produced from a cell expressing a polynucleotide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 67, 71, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, and 159.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the isolated polynucleotide encodes an antigen binding protein or a fragment thereof comprising an antibody light chain comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 70, 74, 98, 100, 102, and 114. In one embodiment the isolated polynucleotide is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 69, 73, 97, 99, 101, and 115. In one embodiment the polypeptide is an antibody produced from a cell expressing a polynucleotide selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 69, 73, 97, 99, 101, and 115.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided are host cells comprising the polynucleotides encoding the antigen binding proteins of the present invention and methods of expressing the antigen binding proteins form said host cells. In addition, methods are provided for making the antigen binging proteins of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of making vectors, host cells and antibodies of the present invention include using conventional expression vectors or recombinant plasmids produced by placing coding sequences for the antibody in operative association with conventional regulatory control sequences capable of controlling the replication and expression in, and/or secretion from, a host cell. Regulatory sequences include promoter sequences, e.g., CMV promoter, and signal sequences, which can be derived from other known antibodies. Similarly, a second expression vector can be produced having a DNA sequence which encodes a complementary antibody light or heavy chain. Preferably this second expression vector is identical to the first except insofar as the coding sequences and selectable markers are concerned, so to ensure as far as possible that each polypeptide chain is functionally expressed. Alternatively, the heavy and light chain coding sequences for the altered antibody may reside on a single vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA selected host cell is co-transfected by conventional techniques with both the first and second vectors (or simply transfected by a single vector) to create the transfected host cell of the invention comprising both the recombinant or synthetic light and heavy chains. The transfected cell is then cultured by conventional techniques to produce the engineered antibody of the invention. The antibody which includes the association of both the recombinant heavy chain and/or light chain is screened from culture by appropriate assay, such as ELISA or RIA. Similar conventional techniques may be employed to construct other altered antibodies and molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable vectors for the cloning and subcloning steps employed in the methods and construction of the compositions of this invention may be selected by one of skill in the art. For example, the conventional pUC series of cloning vectors may be used. One vector, pUC19, is commercially available from supply houses, such as Amersham (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) or Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Additionally, any vector which is capable of replicating readily, has an abundance of cloning sites and selectable genes (e.g., antibiotic resistance), and is easily manipulated may be used for cloning. Thus, the selection of the cloning vector is not a limiting factor in this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, the vectors employed for expression of the antibodies may be selected by one of skill in the art from any conventional vector. The vectors also contain selected regulatory sequences (such as CMV or RSV promoters) which direct the replication and expression of heterologous DNA sequences in selected host cells. These vectors contain the above described DNA sequences which code for the antibody or altered immunoglobulin coding region. In addition, the vectors may incorporate the selected immunoglobulin sequences modified by the insertion of desirable restriction sites for ready manipulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe expression vectors may also be characterized by genes suitable for amplifying expression of the heterologous DNA sequences, e.g., the mammalian dihydrofolate reductase gene (DHFR). Other preferable vector sequences include a poly A signal sequence, such as from bovine growth hormone (BGH) and the betaglobin promoter sequence (betaglopro). The expression vectors useful herein may be synthesized by techniques well known to those skilled in this art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe components of such vectors, e.g. replicons, selection genes, enhancers, promoters, signal sequences and the like, may be obtained from commercial or natural sources or synthesized by known procedures for use in directing the expression and/or secretion of the product of the recombinant DNA in a selected host. Other appropriate expression vectors of which numerous types are known in the art for mammalian, bacterial, insect, yeast, and fungal expression may also be selected for this purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also encompasses a cell line transfected with a recombinant plasmid containing the coding sequences of the antibodies or altered immunoglobulin molecules thereof. Host cells useful for the cloning and other manipulations of these cloning vectors are also conventional. However, most desirably, cells from various strains of \nE. coli \nare used for replication of the cloning vectors and other steps in the construction of altered antibodies of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable host cells or cell lines for the expression of the antibody of the invention are preferably mammalian cells such as NSO, Sp2/0, CHO (e.g. DG44), COS, a fibroblast cell (e.g., 3T3), and myeloma cells, and more preferably a CHO or a myeloma cell. Human cells may be used, thus enabling the molecule to be modified with human glycosylation patterns. Alternatively, other eukaryotic cell lines may be employed. The selection of suitable mammalian host cells and methods for transformation, culture, amplification, screening and product production and purification are known in the art. See, e.g., Sambrook et al., cited above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBacterial cells may prove useful as host cells suitable for the expression of the recombinant Fabs of the present invention (see, e.g., Plückthun, A., Immunol. Rev., 130:151-188 (1992)). However, due to the tendency of proteins expressed in bacterial cells to be in an unfolded or improperly folded form or in a non-glycosylated form, any recombinant Fab produced in a bacterial cell would have to be screened for retention of antigen binding ability. If the molecule expressed by the bacterial cell was produced in a properly folded form, that bacterial cell would be a desirable host. For example, various strains of \nE. coli \nused for expression are well-known as host cells in the field of biotechnology. Various strains of \nB. subtilis, Streptomyces\n, other bacilli and the like may also be employed in this method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere desired, strains of yeast cells known to those skilled in the art are also available as host cells, as well as insect cells, e.g. \nDrosophila and Lepidoptera \nand viral expression systems. See, e.g. Miller et al., Genetic Engineering, 8:277-298, Plenum Press (1986) and references cited therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe general methods by which the vectors may be constructed, the transfection methods required to produce the host cells of the invention, and culture methods necessary to produce the antibody of the invention from such host cell are all conventional techniques. Typically, the culture method of the present invention is a serum-free culture method, usually by culturing cells serum-free in suspension. Likewise, once produced, the antibodies of the invention may be purified from the cell culture contents according to standard procedures of the art, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity columns, column chromatography, gel electrophoresis and the like. Such techniques are within the skill of the art and do not limit this invention. For example, preparation of altered antibodies are described in WO 99/58679 and WO 96/16990.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another method of expression of the antibodies may utilize expression in a transgenic animal, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,316. This relates to an expression system using the animal's casein promoter which when transgenically incorporated into a mammal permits the female to produce the desired recombinant protein in its milk.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of producing an antibody of the invention which method comprises the step of culturing a host cell transformed or transfected with a vector encoding the light and/or heavy chain of the antibody of the invention and recovering the antibody thereby produced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting ADAM and ADAMTS activity by providing a molecule that simultaneously binds both catalytic and disintegrin domains. In certain embodiments the ADAMTS is ADAMTS 4 or ADAMTS5. In silico structure ‘best fit’ computational modeling using separate crystal structures for ADAMTS5 and the ADAMTS5 mAbs 12F4.1H7 and 7B4.1E11 suggest simultaneous antibody/antigen interactions between both the catalytic and disintegrin domains of ADAMTS5. The catalytic and disintegrin domains of ADAM and ADAMTS proteases are separated by a hinge region that imparts flexibility between the domains which may act to regulate function or allow for substrate localization to the catalytic site. The high affinity mAb binding observed at this domain spanning epitope likely ‘locks’ the catalytic and disintegrin domains of ADAMTS5 together thereby neutralizing enzymatic activity. In one embodiment, the molecule is an antibody that binds to both the disintegrin and catalytic domains simultaneously. In another embodiment the molecule is an antibody or antibody fragment of the present invention. In another embodiment, the present invention concerns an antibody which neutralizes the enzymatic activity of AMAMTS5, and in which the antibody simultaneously binds to catalytic and disintegrin domains with a KD of less than about 1×10\n−9 \nor 2×10\n−10 \nas measured by BiaCore or Octet QK.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, pharmaceutical compositions are provided comprising at least one of the antigen binding proteins described herein. The current invention also provides use of at least one antigen binding protein to ADAMTS5 in the manufacture of a medicament for reducing at least one ADAMTS5 activity in a human. The present invention provides use of at least one antigen binding protein to ADAMTS5 for reducing at least one activity of ADAMTS5 in a human comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a composition comprising at least one antigen binding protein to ADAMTS5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may further comprises a second antigen binding protein. In some instance the second antigen binding protein may be a monoclonal antibody. In one embodiment, the second monoclonal antibody binds at least one antigen selected from the group of ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5, NGF, OSM, TNF-α, IL-6, VIP, TRPV1, TRPV4, ADAMTS1, Aggrecan, Collagen II, RANKL, and/or IL-1. By way of example, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may comprise a first antigen binding protein, which may be a monoclonal antibody to ADAMTS5 and a second monoclonal antibody, which may also bind ADAMTS5. By way of another example, a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may comprise a first antigen binding protein, which is a monoclonal antibody that binds to ADAMTS5 and a second antigen binding protein, which is a monoclonal antibody that binds one of the following: ADAMTS4, NGF, OSM, TNF-α, IL-6, VIP, TRPV1, TRPV4, ADAMTS1, Aggrecan, Collagen II, RANKL, and/or IL-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided are methods of treating a patient in need thereof comprising administering at least one dose of pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. In some aspects, the patient is suffering from a disease of the cartilage. A patient may be suffering from one or more diseases chosen from the group of: cancer, pain, chronic pain, neuropathic pain, postoperative pain, osteoarthritis, sports injuries, erosive arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Lyme arthritis, juvenile arthritis, ankylosing spondylosis, neuralgia, neuropathies, algesia, nerve injury, ischaemia, neurodegeneration, inflammatory diseases, cartilage degeneration, diseases affecting the larynx, trachea, auditory canal, intervertebral discs, ligaments, tendons, joint capsules or bone development, invertebral disc degeneration, osteopenia, or periodontal diseases, acute joint injury, and/or a disease related to joint destruction. In some instances, the patient is suffering from osteoarthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, administering at least one dose of said pharmaceutical composition reduces cartilage degradation in said patient. In another embodiment, administering at least one dose of said pharmaceutical composition inhibits and/or reduces aggrecan cleavage in said patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions capable of treating disease associated with cartilage degradation or alleviating the symptoms produced thereby and formulated for the methods and uses described herein. The present invention provides an ADAMTS5 antibody for use in the treatment of diseases of the cartilage, for administration alone or in combination with at least one other therapeutic, including, but not limited to, at least one steroid and/or analgesic. Antigen-binding proteins of the present invention can be co-administered with other therapeutics in the same dose or separately. The present invention also provides ADAMTS5 antibodies or fragments thereof for all of the methods and uses described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “patient” refers to a human or other animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “treatment” means: (1) the amelioration or prevention of the condition being treated or one or more of the biological manifestations of the condition being treated, (2) the interference with (a) one or more points in the biological cascade that leads to or is responsible for the condition being treated or (b) one or more of the biological manifestations of the condition being treated, or (3) the alleviation of one or more of the symptoms or effects associated with the condition being treated. The skilled artisan will appreciate that “prevention” is not an absolute term. In medicine, “prevention” is understood to refer to the prophylactic administration of a drug to substantially diminish the likelihood or severity of a condition or biological manifestation thereof, or to delay the onset of such condition or biological manifestation thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “safe and effective amount” means an amount of at least one antigen binding protein sufficient to significantly induce a positive modification in the condition to be treated but low enough to avoid serious side effects (at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio) within the scope of sound medical judgment. A safe and effective amount of at least one antigen binding protein of the invention will vary with the particular compound chosen (e.g. consider the potency, efficacy, and half-life of the compound); the route of administration chosen; the condition being treated; the severity of the condition being treated; the age, size, weight, and physical condition of the patient being treated; the medical history of the patient to be treated; the duration of the treatment; the nature of concurrent therapy; the desired therapeutic effect; and like factors, but can nevertheless be routinely determined by the skilled artisan.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antigen binding proteins of the invention may be administered by any suitable route of administration, including both systemic administration and topical administration. Systemic administration includes oral administration, parenteral administration, transdermal administration, rectal administration, and administration by inhalation. Parenteral administration refers to routes of administration other than enteral, transdermal, or by inhalation, and is typically by injection or infusion. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous injection or infusion, including intraarticular administration. Inhalation refers to administration into the patient's lungs whether inhaled through the mouth or through the nasal passages. Topical administration includes application to the skin as well as intraocular, otic, intravaginal, and intranasal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antigen binding proteins of the invention may be administered once or according to a dosing regimen wherein a number of doses are administered at varying intervals of time for a given period of time. For example, doses may be administered one, two, three, or four times per day. Doses may be administered until the desired therapeutic effect is achieved or indefinitely to maintain the desired therapeutic effect. Suitable dosing regimens for a antigen binding protein of the invention depend on the pharmacokinetic properties of that compound, such as absorption, distribution, and half-life, which can be determined by the skilled artisan. In addition, suitable dosing regimens, including the duration such regimens are administered, for a compound of the invention depend on the condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age and physical condition of the patient being treated, the medical history of the patient to be treated, the nature of concurrent therapy, the desired therapeutic effect, and like factors within the knowledge and expertise of the skilled artisan. It will be further understood by such skilled artisans that suitable dosing regimens may require adjustment given an individual patient's response to the dosing regimen or over time as individual patient needs change.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments the antibody is used to deliver a drug to the cartilage. Such a drug could be an aggrecanase inhibitor, an anti-inflammatory drug, steroid or a drug related to pain management. Accordingly, in one aspect the invention is a method of delivering a drug to cartilage comprising lining the drug to an antibody of the present invention. Such delivery can be conducted in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the antibody is used to deliver a growth factor to the cartilage which would promote the growth of new cartilage. Such growth factors include Bone Morphogenic proteins, particularly BMP-7. Such delivery can be conducted in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples illustrate various aspects of this invention.\n\n\n \nExample 1 \n\n\nProduction of Mabs to Human ADAMTS4 and Human ADAMTS5\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman ADAMTS5 and ADAMTS4 proteins were produced in transfected CHO cells and/or BacMam transduced HEK293 cells and isolated by conventional chromatography methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSJL mice were co-immunized with purified ADAMTS4 (full length) and ADAMTS5 (truncated, full length, Cat, Cat/dis domains). Immunogenicity was tested on sera from serial bleeds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSplenocytes and lymph nodes were isolated and fused to mouse myeloma cells using a P3X63/Ag8.653-derived fusion partner. Immortalized antibody producing cells were generated. HAT selection was used to deselect unfused myeloma cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResulting hybridoma supernatants from active cultures were screened for specific binding and neutralization of recombinant human ADAMTS5 and ADAMTS4. Hits were identified, confirmed and cloned to monoclonality either by limiting dilution or growth in semi-solid media.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies with desired characteristics were scaled up in liquid culture and the antibody was purified by standard chromatography methods. Resulting purified antibody clones were then further characterized for binding affinity and functional potency.\n\n\n \nExample 2 \n\n\nMurine Antibodies Characterization\n\n\n \n \n \nADAMTS5 mAbs were characterized for neutralization potency using in vitro aggrecan substrate cleavage assays (Table 1). ADAMTS5 mAbs were characterized for affinity using both Octet QK (Table 1) and BiaCore (comparable, but not shown) technologies. Antibodies were also tested for cross-reactivity to Human ADAMTS1, ADAMTS4, ADAMTS13, MMP1, MMP3, MMP9 and MMP13 by celTRF and Octet QK, all of which were negative (not shown). All mAbs were also assessed for orthologue cross-reactivity by binding and neutralization against mouse, canine, and cynomolgus monkey ADAMTS5 (Table 1). Binding was also detected against rat ADAMTS5 (not shown). Affinity comparisons for murine and chimeric forms of anti-human ADAMTS5 mAbs on Octet QK are summarized in Table 2.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacterization of purified anti-human ADAMTS5 monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAggrecan\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSubstrate\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCleavage\n\n\nADAMTS5 Orthologue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAffinity (Qctet QK)\n\n\nNeutralization\n\n\n(Binding/Neutralization)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmAb\n\n\nKa\n\n\nKd\n\n\nKD\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nMouse\n\n\nCynomolgus\n\n\nCanine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1G10.1C9\n\n\n4.47E+04\n\n\n8.43E−06\n\n\n1.88E−10\n\n\n0.375\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2D3.1D4\n\n\n6.67E+04\n\n\n5.75E−06\n\n\n8.62E−11\n\n\n0.031\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3A12.1D7\n\n\n5.67E+04\n\n\n4.67E−06\n\n\n8.24E−11\n\n\n0.769\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5F10.1H6\n\n\n5.53E+04\n\n\n6.99E−06\n\n\n1.26E−10\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11F12.1D12\n\n\n6.57E+04\n\n\n4.33E−05\n\n\n6.58E−10\n\n\n2.527\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12F4.1H7\n\n\n3.31E+04\n\n\n1.44E−05\n\n\n4.36E−10\n\n\n0.06\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7B4.1E11\n\n\n4.86E+04\n\n\n4.36E−05\n\n\n8.99E−10\n\n\n0.08\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n(+/+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect comparison of purified murine and chimeric anti-human\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADAMTS5 mAbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAffinity (Qctet QK)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmAb\n\n\nKa\n\n\nKd\n\n\nKD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurine 12F4.1H7\n\n\n5.64E+04\n\n\n3.86E−06\n\n\n6.85E−11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimeric 12F4.1H7\n\n\n5.55E+04\n\n\n4.43E−06\n\n\n7.99E−11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurine 7B4.1E11\n\n\n7.65E+04\n\n\n2.74E−05\n\n\n3.58E−10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimeric 7B4.1E11\n\n\n7.18E+04\n\n\n2.47E−05\n\n\n3.45E−10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 3 \n\n\nSequences\n\n\n \n \n \nBased on the characteristics identified in Example 2, six monoclonal antibodies were identified.

Cartilage was processed from the bone and cut into 3 mm diameter discs. Discs were randomized and cultured in 96-well plates. Endogenous disease factors in the tissues were allowed to progress for cartilage degradation ex vivo. Samples were treated with the following: matched control IgG isotype, select anti-ADAMTS 5 antibodies (designated as 7B4.1E11 and 12F4.1H7), a selected anti-ADAMTS 4 antibody (designated as 7E8.1E3), or a known aggrecanase/MMP inhibitor, shown as GSK571949 (CAS number 329040-94-0) below. Each treatment condition was tested in multiples of 8 on each donor plate. Inhibition of ARGSVIL (SEQ ID NO:1) neoepitope release was measured for each sample at numerous points throughout the course of the experiment.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described previously, cleavage of aggrecan by aggrecanase typically occurs at a conserved region within the interglobular domain of aggrecan. Enzyme cleavage will produce a released fragment containing a neoepitope with an N-terminal amino acid sequence (ARGSVIL) from aggrecan. This cleavage neoepitope can be detected and quantified using a monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to the cleaved forms, but not intact aggrecan. Both ADAMTS5 antibodies and the ADAMTS5 inhibitor showed significantly greater inhibition of ARGSVIL release than the control and ADAMTS4 antibody. A summary of percent inhibition of ARGSVIL release is shown in \nFIG. 1\n. The results demonstrate that ADAMTS5 specific mAbs are able to inhibit degradation at a rate of approximately 70% for the 2-3 week assessment period as compared to a small molecule assay control compound. These results are consistent within and across many individual donor samples.\n\n\n \nExample 5 \n\n\nADAMTS5 Antibody Dose Response in Human OA Cartilage Explant\n\n\n \n \n \nPercent inhibition of ARGSVIL release was tested as described in Example 4 for a dose response of a selected anti-ADAMTS5 antibody (see \nFIG. 2\n). Murine antibody 7B4.1E11 was tested at the following doses: 1340 nM, 670 nM, 335, nM, 81.25 nM. Control aggrecanase/MMP inhibitor was also used. Percent ARGSVIL release was lowest with the highest doses of anti-ADAMTS5 and declined upon treatment with lower doses. Matched isotype control antibody treatment doses (not shown) were used to determine 0% inhibition and a single effective dose of GSK571949 was used to calculate 100% inhibition. This mAb treatment demonstrates a dose response that appears to reach a maximal effect at the 670 nM dose (\nFIG. 2\n). However, it should be noted that more donors (n=22) were represented in the 670 nM dose point, while the other doses include fewer (n≦5).\n\n\n \nExample 6 \n\n\nIn Vivo Studies DMM\n\n\n \n \n \nOA was induced in mice using a Destabilization Medial Meniscus (DMM) model for assessment of anti-ADAMTS5 antibody efficacy (see \nFIG. 3\n). Two separate experiments are shown. Three days prior to surgical DMM, mice were administered a 0.5 mg/dose of one of the following antibodies: anti-ADAMTS5 (7B4.1E11), anti-ADAMTS5 (12F4.1H7), or IgG isotype. Control groups included untreated mice with DMM surgery, mice with sham surgery and normal mice. Six days after dosing, mice were sacrificed and histopathology was performed by blinded investigators from which a joint score was given to each mouse knee assessed. Anti-ADAMTS5 antibodies showed significantly better mean joint scores compared with IgG1 isotype control. Additionally, sham surgery knees and normal knees had significantly better mean joint scores compared with untreated knees and IgG isotype.\n\n\n \nExample 7 \n\n\nMonoclonal Antibodies Penetrate Cartilage in Vitro and in Vivo\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of therapeutic antibodies to penetrate tissue and reach the site of disease and their specific target is critical for efficacy. Aggrecanases, although classified as secreted proteins, have been shown to preferentially localize to the pericellular regions of chondrocytes within the cartilage matrix. Therefore, in order for a therapeutic mAb to reach an aggrecanase target it may require penetration through the cartilage matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInitially, assessing the ability of a mAb to penetrate human cartilage was performed on ex-vivo tissue using mAbs with multiple specificities, including selected anti-ADAMTS5 mAbs. Full thickness cartilage plugs, spanning synovial surface through sub-chondral bone, from knee replacement surgical specimen were placed in tissue culture for defined durations in the presence of mouse monoclonal antibodies with specificities for human proteins located on the surface of chondrocytes or non-specific isotype controls. At the end of each timepoint tissues were processed for full thickness assessment, sectioned and stained using a FITC-labeled anti-mouse detection antibody. Penetration is defined by the depth and intensity of chondrocyte staining within the cartilage tissue. Irrespective of target specificity, mAb penetration was observed to be a concentration and time-dependent process primarily originating from the synovial surface of the cartilage and proceeding to full thickness penetration within 3-4 days dependent on concentration (not shown). No staining was observed for cartilage plugs treated with isotype control mAbs (not shown).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo assessment of cartilage penetration was performed using near-infrared (NIR) dye labeled monoclonal antibodies, including selective mAbs for ADAMTS4, ADAMTS5 and isotype controls. NIR labeled mAbs were systemically (intraperitoneally) administered (0.5 mg dose) to mice who, six weeks earlier, had undergone surgical induction of osteoarthritis (DMM). Biodistribution of mAbs was monitored in the whole animal at numerous timepoints following administration using a Licor Odyssey system. Four days after mAb administration mice were sacrificed and imaging of the knee joint was performed on the Odyssey. Knee joints were then processed and sectioned for high resolution analysis on a microscope equipped with filters and a camera for NIR detection. Within four days after systemic mAb administration full thickness cartilage penetration could be observed for an anti-ADAMTS5 and anti-ADAMTS4 mAb, while no specific staining was observed for the isotype control mAb (not shown). Characteristic pericellular chondrocyte staining patterns were observed for ADAMTS5 and ADAMTS4 specific mAbs (not shown).\n\n\n \nExample 8 \n\n\nAntibody Humanization—Cloning of Hybridoma Variable Regions\n\n\n \n \n \nTotal RNA was extracted from 7B4.1E11 and 12F4.1 H7 hybridoma cells, heavy and light variable domain cDNA sequence was then generated by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The forward primer for RT-PCR was a mixture of degenerate primers specific for murine immunoglobulin gene leader-sequences and the reverse primer was specific for the antibody constant regions, in this case isotype IgG1 for 7B4.1E11 and IgG2 for 12F4.1H7. Primers were designed based on a strategy described by Jones and Bendig (Bio/Technology 9:88, 1991). RT-PCR was carried out for both V-region sequences to enable subsequent verification of the correct V-region sequences. The V-region products generated by the RT-PCR were cloned (Invitrogen TA Cloning Kit) and sequence data obtained.\n\n\n \nExample 9 \n\n\nAntibody Humanization—Cloning of the chimera\n\n\n \n \n \nThe DNA expression constructs encoding the chimeric antibody were prepared de novo by build-up of overlapping oligonucleotides including restriction sites for cloning into mammalian expression vectors as well as a human signal sequence.

HindIII and BsiWI restriction sites were introduced to frame the V\nL \ndomain containing the signal sequence (SEQ ID NO: 45) for cloning into mammalian expression vector containing the human kappa constant region.\n\n\n \nExample 10 \n\n\nAntibody Humanization—Cloning of the Humanized Variants\n\n\n \n \n \nThe DNA expression constructs encoding the humanized antibody variants were prepared de novo by build-up of overlapping oligonucleotides including restriction sites for cloning into mammalian expression vectors as well as a human signal sequence.

\n \nExpression plasmids encoding the heavy and light chains respectively were transiently co-transfected into HEK 293 6E cells and expressed at small scale to produce antibody. Heavy and light chains of the 7B4 and 12F4 chimeric antibodies and an irrelevant control antibody were also expressed. Antibodies were quantified by ELISA. ELISA plates were coated with anti human IgG (Sigma I3382) at 1 μg/ml and blocked with blocking solution (4% BSA in Tris buffered saline). Various dilutions of the tissue culture supernatants were added and the plate was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Dilutions of a known standard antibody were also added to the plate. The plate was washed in TBST and binding was detected by the addition of a peroxidase labelled anti human kappa light chain antibody (Sigma A7164) at a dilution of 1/1000 in blocking solution. The plate was incubated for 1 hour at room temp before washing in TBST. The plate was developed by addition of OPD substrate (Sigma P9187) and colour development stopped by addition of 2M H\n2\nSO\n4\n. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm and a standard curve plotted using data for the known standard dilutions. The standard curve was used to estimate the concentration of antibody in the tissue culture supernatants.\n\n\n \nExample 12 \n\n\nADAMTS5 Binding ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nA binding ELISA was carried out to test the binding of the expressed antibodies in cell culture supernatant to recombinant ADAMTS5. ELISA plates were coated with recombinant human ADAMTS5 at 0.2 μg/ml and blocked with blocking solution (4% BSA in Tris buffered saline). Various dilutions of the tissue culture supernatants were added and the plate was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before washing in TBST. Binding was detected by the addition of a peroxidase labelled anti human kappa light chain antibody (Sigma A7164) at a dilution of 1/1000 in blocking solution. The plate was incubated for 1 hour at room temp before washing in TBST. The plate was developed by addition of OPD substrate (Sigma P9187) and colour development stopped by addition of 2M H\n2\nSO\n4\n.

This surface was then used to capture the humanized antibodies, ADAMTS5 (R&D Systems 2198-AD) was then passed over the captured antibody at a single concentration of 64 nM, regeneration was carried out using 100 mM phosphoric acid followed by 3M MgCl\n2\n. The binding curves were double referenced with buffer injection (i.e. 0 nM) and the data was fitted to the T100 analysis software using the 1:1 model. The run was carried out at 25° C., using HBS-EP as the running buffer. The data obtained is shown in Table 5.

The relevance of the Octet QK format, which would be representative of a cellular target, is relevant to ADAMTS5 due to the naturally occurring cell associated form of the enzyme in vivo. However, since ADAMTS5 can also be found in a secreted form, we also assessed affinity in an antibody on sensor format using Biacore. Differences observed between the Octet and Biacore analysis may represent format variations (i.e. antigen on sensor in Octet QK and mAb on sensor in Biacore) and technical differences between the systems. However, when run in the same formats the systems were remarkably similar in terms of overall KD for these mAbs. Differences in Kd and Ka were observed, likely due to instrument design differences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe humanized CS mAb (12F4 H4L0) exhibits an overall affinity (1(D) of 38.3 pM as measured in the antigen down format in the Octet QK system. The 12F4 H4L0 mAb demonstrates a KD of 85 pM, in the mAb down format in the Biacore system. 7B4 H0L0 shown for reference, exhibits a KD of 205 and 869 pM in the Octet QK and Biacore systems respectively. Affinity values for the murine and chimeric forms of each mAb are shown here for reference to demonstrate that affinity was retained post humanization. All mAbs in this experiment contained fully functional Fc portions (i.e., were not Fc-disabled).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparative affinity of murine, chimeric and humanized ADAMTS5 mAbs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAffinity (Biacore) mAb Down no Avidity\n\n\nAffinity (Octet QK) Antigen Down incl Avidity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmAb\n\n\nK\na\n \n\n\nK\nd\n \n\n\nKD\n\n\nK\na\n \n\n\nK\nd\n \n\n\nKD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurine\n\n\n1.56E+06\n\n\n1.04E−04\n\n\n0.067 nM\n\n\n6.99E+04\n\n\n2.49E−06\n\n\n0.0356 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12F4.1H7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimeric\n\n\n1.56E+06\n\n\n7.86E−05\n\n\n0.051 nM\n\n\n6.85E+04\n\n\n2.96E−06\n\n\n0.0431 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12F4.1H7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumanized\n\n\n4.89E+05\n\n\n4.15E−05\n\n\n0.085 nM\n\n\n7.54E+04\n\n\n2.88E−06\n\n\n0.0383 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12F4.1H7 H4L0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMurine\n\n\n4.81E+06\n\n\n2.32E−03\n\n\n0.483 nM\n\n\n9.25E+04\n\n\n2.59E−05\n\n\n 0.280 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7B4.1E11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimeric\n\n\n2.43E+06\n\n\n1.14E−03\n\n\n0.473 nM\n\n\n1.00E+05\n\n\n2.61E−05\n\n\n 0.260 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7B4.1E11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHumanized\n\n\n5.54E+05\n\n\n4.81E−04\n\n\n0.869 nM\n\n\n1.06E+05\n\n\n2.16E−05\n\n\n 0.205 nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7B4.1E11 H0L0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 15 \n\n\nHuman OA Cartilage Explant Experiment Humanized 12F4 H4L0 Dose Range\n\n\n \n \n \nThe humanized 12F4 H4L0 Fc disabled mAb was assessed in this system in a dose response format versus appropriate Fc disabled isotype and other positive and negative controls and in comparison to the parental murine 12F4.1H7 version at a single dose. Multiple donors (n=4) were assessed individually in this study and results were compiled to generate a mean inhibition score across an OA patient population. GSK571949 was used at a single concentration (2 uM) as an assay control to set maximal inhibition levels. The results demonstrate a clear 12F4 H4L0 dose response with a maximal response achieved at the highest dose (1333 nM) as compared to a dose range of irrelevant humanized isotype control mAb (\nFIG. 10\n). Nearly complete inhibition of ARGS neoepitope in relation to GSK571949 was achieved at the highest dose (2 uM). In addition, the level of inhibition for 12F4 H4L0 was demonstrated to be greater than 12F4.1H7 in these donors, suggesting retained efficacy following humanization. Although the level of efficacy is greater for the humanized version of the mAb it is not clear whether this is a true increase or due to differences in mAb preparations. It should be noted that the level of efficacy observed with the 12F4.1H7 form of the mAb in separate experiments with additional OA donors (\nFIG. 1\n) was greater than observed here. Taking into account the relevance of this system to the human disease and observed efficacy, this data strongly supports validation of this approach and these mAbs.\n\n\n \nExample 16 \n\n\nHuman OA Cartilage Explant Therapeutic Pulse Chase Experiment\n\n\n \n \n \nThis experiment was designed as in Example 15, however following a 5 day treatment duration with the mAbs or compounds to allow for saturation of the system, the treatments were removed and replaced with fresh media lacking the treatment. The assay was continued for 4 weeks with periodic sampling of the culture media for subsequent assessment of cartilage degradation markers. Following each sampling, the same volume withdrawn in the sample was replaced with fresh media. This format was designed to address the potency and duration of the therapeutic effect and indirectly suggest ADAMTS5 turnover rate within the tissue. Results shown compiled from identical experiments using 4 different human OA donors (\nFIG. 11\n). These results provide evidence of the extended duration of the ADAMTS5 mAb response in human OA cartilage even in advanced disease state (i.e. at time of joint replacement). In addition, these results provide evidence of the low turnover rate of ADAMTS5 in diseased tissue.\n\n\n \nExample 17 \n\n\nFc-Disabled Humanized Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nThe gene encoding the humanized 12F4 H4 V\nH \ndomain was cloned onto the modified \nhuman gamma\n 1 constant region, IgG1m(AA). The IgG1m(AA) constant region contains two alanine substitutions in the CH2 domain at positions L235 and G237(EU index numbering). These mutations render the resulting antibody unable to bind the necessary Fc receptors or complement component C1q, thus disabling its ability to induce antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement dependent cvtotoxi city (CDC).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDNA\n\n\nAmino Acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSequence\n\n\nSequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBPC1661\n\n\n12F4 H4L0\n\n\n12F4 H4 heavy chain\n\n\n159\n\n\n158\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIgG1m(AA)\n\n\n12F4 L0 light chain\n\n\n113\n\n\n114\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression plasmids encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibodies BPC1623 (12F4 Chimera), BPC1659 (12F4 H4L0 IgG1 wt) and BPC1661 (12F4 H4L0 IgG1m(AA)) were expressed in HEK cells. Antibodies were purified by Protein A affinity chromatography and quantified by spectrophotometry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA binding ELISA was carried out to compare the binding of the purified antibodies to ADAMTS5. An irrelevant antibody of IgG1 wt isotype and an Fc disabled antibody were included as negative controls. Briefly, plates were coated with recombinant human ADAMTS5 at 0.2 ug/ml and blocked with blocking solution (4% BSA in Tris buffered saline). Various concentrations of purified antibody were added and the plate incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before washing with TBST (Tris buffered saline +0.05% Tween 20). Binding was detected by the addition of a peroxidase labelled anti human kappa light chain antibody (Sigma A7164) at a dilution of 1/1000 in blocking solution. The plate was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature before washing in TBST. The plate was developed by addition of OPD substrate (Sigma P9187) and colour development stopped by addition of 2M H\n2\nSO\n4\n. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a plate reader and the mean absorbance plotted against concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 12\n shows the binding of the purified anti ADAMTS5 antibodies to recombinant antigen.\n\n\n \nExample 18 \n\n\nBiacore of Fc-Disabled Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein A was immobilized on a CM5 biosensor chip by primary amine coupling. This surface was used to capture the Fc disabled anti-ADAMTS5 antibody, 12F4 H4L0 IgG1m(AA) (BPC1661), (CHO and HEK expressed material). Recombinant human ADAMTS5 (R&D Systems 2198-AD) was used as the analyte at 64 nM, 16 nM, 4 nM, 1 nM, 0.25 nM and 0.0625 nM, with a buffer injection (i.e. 0 nM) used to double reference the binding curves. Regeneration of the capture surface (i.e. removal of the captured antibody) was with 50 mM NaOH. The running buffer was HBS-EP and the run was carried out on the Biacore T100 at 25° C. The data was fitted to the 1:1 model inherent to the machines analysis software. The results showed that there was no difference between material produced in different cell lines in terms of binding affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruct\n\n\nka\n\n\nkd\n\n\nKD (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12F4 H4L0 IgG1m(AA) (HEK\n\n\n9.43E+05\n\n\n6.98E−05\n\n\n0.074\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpressed)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n12F4 H4L0 IgG1m(AA) (CHO\n\n\n8.30E+05\n\n\n5.85E−05\n\n\n0.070\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpressed)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 19 \n\n\nCrystallography Structure Modeling of Antigen-Antibody Interaction—Implications for Epitope and MOA\n\n\n \n \n \nIn silico structure ‘best fit’ computational modeling using separate crystal structures for ADAMTS5 and the ADAMTS5 mAb 12F4.1H7 suggest simultaneous antibody/antigen interactions between both the catalytic and disintegrin domains of ADAMTS5. The catalytic and disintegrin domains of ADAM and ADAMTS proteases are separated by a hinge region that imparts flexibility between the domains which may act to regulate function or allow for substrate localization to the catalytic site. The high affinity mAb binding observed at this domain spanning epitope likely ‘locks’ the catalytic and disintegrin domains of ADAMTS5 together thereby neutralizing enzymatic activity.

Field of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention relates to nucleic acid molecules encoding FGF21 mutant polypeptides, FGF21 mutant polypeptides, pharmaceutical compositions comprising FGF21 mutant polypeptides, and methods for treating metabolic disorders using such nucleic acids, polypeptides, or pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Background of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFGF21 is a secreted polypeptide that belongs to a subfamily of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) that includes FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23 (Itoh et al., 2004, \nTrend Genet. \n20: 563-69). FGF21 is an atypical FGF in that it is heparin independent and functions as a hormone in the regulation of glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFGF21 was isolated from a liver cDNA library as a hepatic secreted factor. It is highly expressed in liver and pancreas and is the only member of the FGF family to be primarily expressed in liver. Transgenic mice overexpressing FGF21 exhibit metabolic phenotypes of slow growth rate, low plasma glucose and triglyceride levels, and an absence of age-associated \ntype\n 2 diabetes, islet hyperplasia, and obesity. Pharmacological administration of recombinant FGF21 protein in rodent and primate models results in normalized levels of plasma glucose, reduced triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. In addition, FGF21 reduces body weight and body fat by increasing energy expenditure, physical activity, and metabolic rate. Experimental research provides support for the pharmacological administration of FGF21 for the treatment of \ntype\n 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, and other metabolic conditions or disorders in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman FGF21 has a short half-life in vivo. In mice, the half-life of human FGF21 is 1 to 2 hours, and in cynomolgus monkeys, the half-life is 2.5 to 3 hours. In developing an FGF21 protein for use as a therapeutic in the treatment of \ntype\n 2 diabetes, an increase in half-life would be desirable. FGF21 proteins having an enhanced half-life would allow for less frequent dosing of patients being administered the protein. Such proteins are described herein.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present disclosure provides an isolated polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:4, further comprising the substitution of any amino acid for: the alanine residue at \nposition\n 45, the leucine residue at position 86, the leucine residue at position 98, the alanine residue at position 111, the alanine residue at position 129, the glycine residue at position 170, the proline residue at position 171 or the serine residue at position 172, and combinations thereof.

Optionally, the half-life can be further extended by fusing an antibody, or portion thereof, to the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the wild-type FGF21 sequence. It is also possible to further extend the half-life or decrease aggregation of the wild-type FGF21 protein by introducing amino acid substitutions into the protein. Such modified proteins are referred to herein as mutants, or FGF21 mutants, and form embodiments of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant nucleic acid methods used herein, including in the Examples, are generally those set forth in Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual \n(Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989) or \nCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology \n(Ausubel et al., eds., Green Publishers Inc. and Wiley and Sons 1994), both of which are incorporated herein by reference for any purpose.\n\n\n \n1. GENERAL DEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe term “isolated nucleic acid molecule” refers to a nucleic acid molecule of the invention that (1) has been separated from at least about 50 percent of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, or other materials with which it is naturally found when total nucleic acid is isolated from the source cells, (2) is not linked to all or a portion of a polynucleotide to which the “isolated nucleic acid molecule” is linked in nature, (3) is operably linked to a polynucleotide which it is not linked to in nature, or (4) does not occur in nature as part of a larger polynucleotide sequence. Preferably, the isolated nucleic acid molecule of the present invention is substantially free from any other contaminating nucleic acid molecules or other contaminants that are found in its natural environment that would interfere with its use in polypeptide production or its therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic or research use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “vector” is used to refer to any molecule (e.g., nucleic acid, plasmid, or virus) used to transfer coding information to a host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “expression vector” refers to a vector that is suitable for transformation of a host cell and contains nucleic acid sequences that direct and/or control the expression of inserted heterologous nucleic acid sequences. Expression includes, but is not limited to, processes such as transcription, translation, and RNA splicing, if introns are present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “operably linked” is used herein to refer to an arrangement of flanking sequences wherein the flanking sequences so described are configured or assembled so as to perform their usual function. Thus, a flanking sequence operably linked to a coding sequence may be capable of effecting the replication, transcription and/or translation of the coding sequence. For example, a coding sequence is operably linked to a promoter when the promoter is capable of directing transcription of that coding sequence. A flanking sequence need not be contiguous with the coding sequence, so long as it functions correctly. Thus, for example, intervening untranslated yet transcribed sequences can be present between a promoter sequence and the coding sequence and the promoter sequence can still be considered “operably linked” to the coding sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “host cell” is used to refer to a cell which has been transformed, or is capable of being transformed with a nucleic acid sequence and then of expressing a selected gene of interest. The term includes the progeny of the parent cell, whether or not the progeny is identical in morphology or in genetic make-up to the original parent, so long as the selected gene is present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “isolated polypeptide” refers to a polypeptide of the present invention that (1) has been separated from at least about 50 percent of polynucleotides, lipids, carbohydrates, or other materials with which it is naturally found when isolated from the source cell, (2) is not linked (by covalent or noncovalent interaction) to all or a portion of a polypeptide to which the “isolated polypeptide” is linked in nature, (3) is operably linked (by covalent or noncovalent interaction) to a polypeptide with which it is not linked in nature, or (4) does not occur in nature. Preferably, the isolated polypeptide is substantially free from any other contaminating polypeptides or other contaminants that are found in its natural environment that would interfere with its therapeutic, diagnostic, prophylactic or research use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “naturally occurring” when used in connection with biological materials such as nucleic acid molecules, polypeptides, host cells, and the like, refers to materials which are found in nature and are not manipulated by man. Similarly, “non-naturally occurring” as used herein refers to a material that is not found in nature or that has been structurally modified or synthesized by man. When used in connection with nucleotides, the term “naturally occurring” refers to the bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), thymine (T), and uracil (U). When used in connection with amino acids, the term “naturally occurring” refers to the 20 amino acids alanine (A), cysteine (C), aspartic acid (D), glutamic acid (E), phenylalanine (F), glycine (G), histidine (H), isoleucine (I), lysine (K), leucine (L), methionine (M), asparagine (N), proline (P), glutamine (Q), arginine (R), serine (S), threonine (T), valine (V), tryptophan (W), and tyrosine (Y).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “FGF21 polypeptide” refers to a naturally-occurring wild-type polypeptide expressed in humans. For purposes of this disclosure, the term “FGF21 polypeptide” can be used interchangeably to refer to any full-length FGF21 polypeptide, e.g., SEQ ID NO:2, which consists of 209 amino acid residues and which is encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1; any mature form of the polypeptide, e.g., SEQ ID NO:4, which consists of 181 amino acid residues and which is encoded by the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, and in which the 28 amino acid residues at the amino-terminal end of the full-length FGF21 polypeptide (i.e., which constitute the signal peptide) have been removed, and variants thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “FGF21 polypeptide mutant” and “FGF21 mutant” refer to an FGF21 polypeptide variant in which a naturally occurring FGF21 amino acid sequence has been modified. Such modifications include, but are not limited to, one or more amino acid substitutions, including substitutions with non-naturally occurring amino acid analogs, and truncations. Thus, FGF21 polypeptide mutants include, but are not limited to, site-directed FGF21 mutants, truncated FGF21 polypeptides, proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutants, aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutants, FGF21 combination mutants, and FGF21 fusion proteins, as described herein. For the purpose of identifying the specific truncations and amino acid substitutions of the FGF21 mutants of the present invention, the numbering of the amino acid residues truncated or mutated corresponds to that of the mature 181-residue FGF21 polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments of the present invention, an FGF21 polypeptide mutant comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least about 85 percent identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, but wherein specific residues conferring a desirable property to the FGF21 polypeptide mutant, e.g., proteolysis-resistance, increased half life or aggregation-reducing properties and combinations thereof, have not been further modified. In other words, with the exception of residues in the FGF21 mutant sequence that have been modified in order to confer proteolysis-resistance, aggregation-reducing, or other properties, about 15 percent of all other amino acid residues in the FGF21 mutant sequence can be modified. For example, in the FGF21 mutant Q173E, up to 15 percent of all amino acid residues other than the glutamic acid residue, which was substituted for glutamine at position 173, could be modified. In still other embodiments, an FGF21 polypeptide mutant comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least about 90 percent, or about 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99 percent identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, but wherein the specific residues conferring the FGF21 polypeptide mutant's proteolysis-resistance or aggregation-reducing properties have not been further modified. Such FGF21 polypeptide mutants possess at least one activity of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also encompasses a nucleic acid molecule encoding an FGF21 polypeptide mutant comprising an amino acid sequence that is at least about 85 percent identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, but wherein specific residues conferring a desirable property to the FGF21 polypeptide mutant, e.g., proteolysis-resistance, increased half life or aggregation-reducing properties and combinations thereof have not been further modified. In other words, with the exception of nucleotides that encode residues in the FGF21 mutant sequence that have been modified in order to confer proteolysis-resistance, aggregation-reducing, or other properties, about 15 percent of all other nucleotides in the FGF21 mutant sequence can be modified. For example, in the FGF21 mutant Q173E, up to 15 percent of all nucleotides other than the nucleotides encoding the glutamic acid residue, which was substituted for glutamine at position 173, could be modified. The present invention further encompasses a nucleic acid molecule encoding an FGF21 polypeptide mutant comprising an amino acid sequence that is at least about 90 percent, or about 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99 percent identical to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, but wherein the specific residues conferring the FGF21 polypeptide mutant's proteolysis-resistance or aggregation-reducing properties have not been further modified. Such FGF21 mutants possess at least one activity of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also encompasses a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence that is at least about 85 percent identical to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, but wherein the nucleotides encoding amino acid residues conferring the encoded FGF21 polypeptide mutant's proteolysis-resistance, aggregation-reducing or other properties have not been further modified. In other words, with the exception of residues in the FGF21 mutant sequence that have been modified in order to confer proteolysis-resistance, aggregation-reducing, or other properties, about 15 percent of all other amino acid residues in the FGF21 mutant sequence can be modified. For example, in the FGF21 mutant Q173E, up to 15 percent of all amino acid residues other than the glutamic acid residue, which was substituted for glutamine at position 173, could be modified. The present invention further encompasses a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence that is at least about 90 percent, or about 95, 96, 97, 98, or 99 percent identical to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, but wherein the nucleotides encoding amino acid residues conferring the encoded FGF21 polypeptide mutant's proteolysis-resistance or aggregation-reducing properties have not been further modified. Such nucleic acid molecules encode FGF21 mutant polypeptides possessing at least one activity of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “biologically active FGF21 polypeptide mutant” refers to any FGF21 polypeptide mutant described herein that possesses an activity of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide, such as the ability to lower blood glucose, insulin, triglyceride, or cholesterol; reduce body weight; and improve glucose tolerance, energy expenditure, or insulin sensitivity, regardless of the type or number of modifications that have been introduced into the FGF21 polypeptide mutant. FGF21 polypeptide mutants possessing a somewhat decreased level of FGF21 activity relative to the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide can nonetheless be considered to be biologically active FGF21 polypeptide mutants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “effective amount” and “therapeutically effective amount” each refer to the amount of an FGF21 polypeptide mutant used to support an observable level of one or more biological activities of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide, such as the ability to lower blood glucose, insulin, triglyceride, or cholesterol levels; reduce body weight; or improve glucose tolerance, energy expenditure, or insulin sensitivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” or “physiologically acceptable carrier” as used herein refers to one or more formulation materials suitable for accomplishing or enhancing the delivery of an FGF21 polypeptide mutant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antigen” refers to a molecule or a portion of a molecule that is capable of being bound by an antibody, and additionally that is capable of being used in an animal to produce antibodies that are capable of binding to an epitope of that antigen. An antigen may have one or more epitopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “native Fc” refers to molecule or sequence comprising the sequence of a non-antigen-binding fragment resulting from digestion of whole antibody or produced by other means, whether in monomeric or multimeric form, and can contain the hinge region. The original immunoglobulin source of the native Fc is preferably of human origin and can be any of the immunoglobulins, although IgG1 and IgG2 are preferred. Native Fc molecules are made up of monomeric polypeptides that can be linked into dimeric or multimeric forms by covalent (i.e., disulfide bonds) and non-covalent association. The number of intermolecular disulfide bonds between monomeric subunits of native Fc molecules ranges from 1 to 4 depending on class (e.g., IgG, IgA, and IgE) or subclass (e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgA1, and IgGA2). One example of a native Fc is a disulfide-bonded dimer resulting from papain digestion of an IgG (see Ellison et al., 1982, \nNucleic Acids Res. \n10: 4071-9). The term “native Fc” as used herein is generic to the monomeric, dimeric, and multimeric forms. An example of an Fc polypeptide sequence is presented in SEQ ID NO:13.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “Fc variant” refers to a molecule or sequence that is modified from a native Fc but still comprises a binding site for the salvage receptor, FcRn (neonatal Fc receptor). International Publication Nos. WO 97/34631 and WO 96/32478 describe exemplary Fc variants, as well as interaction with the salvage receptor, and are hereby incorporated by reference. Thus, the term “Fc variant” can comprise a molecule or sequence that is humanized from a non-human native Fc. Furthermore, a native Fc comprises regions that can be removed because they provide structural features or biological activity that are not required for the fusion molecules of the FGF21 mutants of the present invention. Thus, the term “Fc variant” comprises a molecule or sequence that lacks one or more native Fc sites or residues, or in which one or more Fc sites or residues has be modified, that affect or are involved in: (1) disulfide bond formation, (2) incompatibility with a selected host cell, (3) N-terminal heterogeneity upon expression in a selected host cell, (4) glycosylation, (5) interaction with complement, (6) binding to an Fc receptor other than a salvage receptor, or (7) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Fc variants are described in further detail hereinafter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “Fc domain” encompasses native Fc and Fc variants and sequences as defined above. As with Fc variants and native Fc molecules, the term “Fc domain” includes molecules in monomeric or multimeric form, whether digested from whole antibody or produced by other means. In some embodiments of the present invention, an Fc domain can be fused to FGF21 or a FGF21 mutant (including a truncated form of FGF21 or a FGF21 mutant) via, for example, a covalent bond between the Fc domain and the FGF21 sequence. Such fusion proteins can form multimers via the association of the Fc domains and both these fusion proteins and their multimers are an aspect of the present invention.\n\n\n \n2. SITE-SPECIFIC FGF21 MUTANTS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe term “site-specific FGF21 mutant” or “substituted FGF21 mutant” refers to an FGF21 mutant polypeptide having an amino acid sequence that differs from the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring FGF21 polypeptide sequence, e.g., SEQ ID NOs:2 and 4 and variants thereof. Site-specific FGF21 mutants can be generated by introducing amino acid substitutions, either conservative or non-conservative and using naturally or non-naturally occurring amino acids, at particular positions of the FGF21 polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Conservative amino acid substitution” can involve a substitution of a native amino acid residue (i.e., a residue found in a given position of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide sequence) with a normative residue (i.e., a residue that is not found in a given position of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide sequence) such that there is little or no effect on the polarity or charge of the amino acid residue at that position. Conservative amino acid substitutions also encompass non-naturally occurring amino acid residues that are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems. These include peptidomimetics, and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNaturally occurring residues can be divided into classes based on common side chain properties:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) hydrophobic: norleucine, Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) acidic: Asp, Glu;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(4) basic: Asn, Gln, His, Lys, Arg;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConservative substitutions can involve the exchange of a member of one of these classes for another member of the same class. Non-conservative substitutions can involve the exchange of a member of one of these classes for a member from another class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDesired amino acid substitutions (whether conservative or non-conservative) can be determined by those skilled in the art at the time such substitutions are desired. An exemplary (but not limiting) list of amino acid substitutions is set forth in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmino Acid Substitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOriginal\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResidue\n\n\nExemplary Substitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla\n\n\nVal, Leu, Ile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg\n\n\nLys, Gln, Asn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn\n\n\nGln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp\n\n\nGlu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys\n\n\nSer, Ala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln\n\n\nAsn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlu\n\n\nAsp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly\n\n\nPro, Ala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis\n\n\nAsn, Gln, Lys, Arg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle\n\n\nLeu, Val, Met, Ala, Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu\n\n\nIle, Val, Met, Ala, Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys\n\n\nArg, Gln, Asn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet\n\n\nLeu, Phe, Ile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe\n\n\nLeu, Val, Ile, Ala, Tyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer\n\n\nThr, Ala, Cys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp\n\n\nTyr, Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr\n\n\nTrp, Phe, Thr, Ser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal\n\n\nIle, Met, Leu, Phe, Ala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n3. TRUNCATED FGF21 POLYPEPTIDES\n\n\n \n \n \nOne embodiment of the present invention is directed to truncated forms of the mature FGF21 polypeptide. This embodiment of the present invention arose from an effort to identify truncated FGF21 polypeptides that are capable of providing an activity that is similar, and in some instances superior, to untruncated forms of the mature FGF21 polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “truncated FGF21 polypeptide” refers to an FGF21 polypeptide in which amino acid residues have been removed from the amino-terminal (or N-terminal) end of the FGF21 polypeptide, amino acid residues have been removed from the carboxyl-terminal (or C-terminal) end of the FGF21 polypeptide, or amino acid residues have been removed from both the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal ends of the FGF21 polypeptide. The various truncations disclosed herein were prepared as described herein Examples 3 and 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity of N-terminally truncated FGF21 polypeptides and C-terminally truncated FGF21 polypeptides can be assayed using an in vitro ELK-luciferase assay as described in Example 4. Specific details of the in vitro assays that can be used to examine the activity of truncated FGF21 polypeptides can be found in Example 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity of the truncated FGF21 polypeptides of the present invention can also be assessed in an in vivo assay, such as ob/ob mice as shown in Examples 5 and 7. Generally, to assess the in vivo activity of a truncated FGF21 polypeptide, the truncated FGF21 polypeptide can be administered to a test animal intraperitoneally. After a desired incubation period (e.g., one hour or more), a blood sample can be drawn, and blood glucose levels can be measured. Specific details of the in vivo assays that can be used to examine the activity of truncated FGF21 polypeptides can be found in Examples 5 and 7.\n\n\n \n \n \n \na. N-Terminal Truncations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the present invention, N-terminal truncations comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 amino acid residues from the N-terminal end of the mature FGF21 polypeptide. As demonstrated in, for example, Example 5 and \nFIG. 3\n, truncated FGF21 polypeptides having N-terminal truncations of fewer than 9 amino acid residues retain the ability of the mature FGF21 polypeptide to lower blood glucose in an individual. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the present invention encompasses truncated forms of the mature FGF21 polypeptide or FGF21 polypeptide mutants having N-terminal truncations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb. C-Terminal Truncations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the present invention, C-terminal truncations comprise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 amino acid residues from the C-terminal end of the mature FGF21 polypeptide. As demonstrated in, for example, Example 4 and \nFIG. 1B\n, truncated FGF21 polypeptides having C-terminal truncations of fewer than 13 amino acid residues exhibited an efficacy of at least 50% of the efficacy of wild-type FGF21 in an in vitro ELK-luciferase assay, indicating that these FGF21 mutants retain the ability of the mature FGF21 polypeptide to lower blood glucose in an individual. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the present invention encompasses truncated forms of the mature FGF21 polypeptide or FGF21 polypeptide mutants having C-terminal truncations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc. N-Terminal and C-Terminal Truncations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the present invention, truncated FGF21 polypeptides can have a combination of N-terminal and C-terminal truncations. Truncated FGF21 polypeptides having a combination of N-terminal and C-terminal truncations share the activity of corresponding truncated FGF21 polypeptides having either the N-terminal or C-terminal truncations alone. In other words, truncated FGF21 polypeptides having both N-terminal truncations of fewer than 9 amino acid residues and C-terminal truncations of fewer than 13 amino acid residues possess similar or greater blood glucose-lowering activity as truncated FGF21 polypeptides having N-terminal truncations of fewer than 9 amino acid residues or truncated FGF21 polypeptides having C-terminal truncations of fewer than 13 amino acid residues. Accordingly, in particular embodiments, the present invention encompasses truncated forms of the mature FGF21 polypeptide or FGF21 polypeptide mutants having both N-terminal truncations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 amino acid residues and C-terminal truncations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs with all FGF21 mutants of the present invention, truncated FGF21 polypeptides can optionally comprise an amino-terminal methionine residue, which can be introduced by directed mutation or as a result of a bacterial expression process.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe truncated FGF21 polypeptides of the present invention can be prepared as described in Examples 3 and 6. Those of ordinary skill in the art, familiar with standard molecular biology techniques, can employ that knowledge, coupled with the instant disclosure, to make and use the truncated FGF21 polypeptides of the present invention. Standard techniques can be used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, tissue culture, and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). See, e.g., Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual\n, supra, which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques can be performed according to manufacturer's specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art, or as described herein. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses; chemical analyses; pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery; and treatment of patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe truncated FGF21 polypeptides of the present invention can also be fused to another entity, which can impart additional properties to the truncated FGF21 polypeptide. In one embodiment of the present invention, a truncated FGF21 polypeptide can be fused to an Fc sequence. Such fusion can be accomplished using known molecular biological methods and/or the guidance provided herein. The benefits of such fusion polypeptides, as well as methods for making such fusion polypeptides, are discussed in more detail herein.\n\n\n \n4. PROTEOLYSIS-RESISTANT FGF21 MUTANTS\n\n\n \n \n \nAs described in Example 8, mature FGF21 was found to be undergoing in vivo degradation, which was ultimately determined to arise from proteolytic attack. The in vivo degradation of mature FGF21 was found to lead to shorter effective half-life, which can adversely affect the therapeutic potential of a molecule. Accordingly, a directed study was performed to identify FGF21 mutants that exhibit a resistance to proteolysis. As a result of this investigation, the sites in the mature FGF21 polypeptide that were determined to be particularly susceptible to proteolysis include the peptide bond between the amino acid residues at positions 4-5, 20-21, 151-152, and 171-172.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA broad but focused and directed study was performed to identify particular substitutions that eliminate the observed proteolytic effect while not affecting the activity of the protein to an unacceptable degree. Tables 8 and 11 highlight some of the mutants that were prepared and tested. As described in, for example, Examples 13 and 14, not all FGF21 mutants exhibited an ideal profile; some mutants conferred proteolysis resistance but at the cost of compromised FGF21 activity. Other mutations retained FGF21 activity but did not confer proteolysis resistance. Several mutants, including, for example, FGF21 P171G, retained a similar level of activity as wild-type FGF21 while also exhibiting resistance to proteolytic degradation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne selection criteria for identifying desirable proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutants was that the activity of the FGF21 mutant be essentially the same as, or greater than, the activity of wild-type FGF21. Therefore, another embodiment of the present invention is directed to FGF21 mutants that are resistant to proteolysis and still retain activity that is essentially the same as, or greater than, wild-type FGF21. Although less desirable in some cases, FGF21 mutants that are resistant to proteolysis but exhibit somewhat decreased activity form another embodiment of the present invention. In some cases it can be desirable to maintain a degree of proteolysis, and consequently, FGF21 mutants that allow some degree of proteolysis to occur also form another embodiment of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs with all FGF21 mutants of the present invention, the proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutants of the present invention can be prepared as described herein. Those of ordinary skill in the art, for example, those familiar with standard molecular biology techniques, can employ that knowledge, coupled with the instant disclosure, to make and use the proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutants of the present invention. Standard techniques can be used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, tissue culture, and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). See, e.g., Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual\n, supra, which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques can be performed according to manufacturer's specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art, or as described herein. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses; chemical analyses; pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery; and treatment of patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutants of the present invention can be fused to another entity, which can impart additional properties to the proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutant. In one embodiment of the present invention, a proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutant can be fused to an IgG Fc sequence, e.g., SEQ ID NO:13. Such fusion can be accomplished using known molecular biological methods and/or the guidance provided herein. The benefits of such fusion polypeptides, as well as methods for making such fusion polypeptides, are known and are discussed in more detail herein.\n\n\n \n5. AGGREGATION-REDUCING FGF21 MUTANTS\n\n\n \n \n \nAs described in Example 15, one property of the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide is its propensity to aggregate. At concentrations over about 5 mg/mL, the aggregation rate is high at room temperature. As shown and described herein, the aggregation rate for the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide is both concentration and temperature dependent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAggregation can prove to be a challenge when working with wild-type FGF21 at these concentrations, such as in the context of a therapeutic formulation. Accordingly, a directed study was performed to identify FGF21 mutants that exhibit reduced FGF21 aggregation. The resulting FGF21 mutants were then tested for the propensity to aggregate at various concentrations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA broad but focused and directed study was performed to identify particular substitutions that eliminate or reduce the observed aggregation effect of wild-type FGF21 while not affecting the activity of the protein to an unacceptable degree. The approach for identifying suitable aggregation-reducing mutants is described in Example 15. Table 16 highlights some of the mutants that were prepared and tested. As described in, for example, Example 17, not all FGF21 mutants exhibited an ideal profile. Some mutants, such as FGF21 L58E had compromised FGF21 activity and were not studied further. Other mutations, such as FGF21 A134E, retained FGF21 activity but did not confer reduced aggregation properties. Several mutants, such as FGF21 L98R, retained FGF21 activity and also exhibited reduced aggregation. One mutant, FGF21 A45K, surprisingly exhibited increased FGF21 activity while also exhibiting reduced aggregation properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne selection criteria for identifying desirable aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutants was that the activity of the FGF21 mutant be essentially similar to, or greater than, the activity of wild-type FGF21. Therefore, another embodiment of the present invention is directed to FGF21 mutants having reduced aggregation properties while still retaining an FGF21 activity that is similar to, or greater than, wild-type FGF21. Although less desirable in some cases, FGF21 mutants having reduced aggregation properties but exhibiting somewhat decreased FGF21 activity form another embodiment of the present invention. In some cases it may be desirable to maintain a degree of aggregation, and consequently, FGF21 mutants that allow some degree of aggregation to occur also form another embodiment of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs with all FGF21 mutants of the present invention, the aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutants of the present invention can be prepared as described herein. Those of ordinary skill in the art, familiar with standard molecular biology techniques, can employ that knowledge, coupled with the instant disclosure, to make and use the aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutants of the present invention. Standard techniques can be used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, tissue culture, and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). See, e.g., Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual\n, supra, which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques can be performed according to manufacturer's specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art, or as described herein. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses; chemical analyses; pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery; and treatment of patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutants of the present invention can be fused to another entity, which can impart additional properties to the aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutant. In one embodiment of the present invention, an aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutant can be fused to an IgG Fc sequence, e.g., SEQ ID NO:13. Such fusion can be accomplished using known molecular biological methods and/or the guidance provided herein. The benefits of such fusion polypeptides, as well as methods for making such fusion polypeptides, are discussed in more detail herein.\n\n\n \n6. FGF21 COMBINATION MUTANTS\n\n\n \n \n \nAs described herein, the wild-type FGF21 sequence possesses several properties that can pose significant challenges when FGF21 is used as a therapeutic molecule. Among these challenges are the protein's susceptibility to degradation and its propensity for aggregation at high concentration. After an exhaustive effort to identify FGF21 polypeptides that overcome each of these challenges, a directed study was performed to determine whether the amino acid substitutions conferring proteolysis-resistance and those conferring aggregation-reducing properties could be combined in an additive or synergistic fashion in a single polypeptide sequence while maintaining activity levels that are equal to or greater than the activity of wild-type FGF21. This represented a significant challenge, as it is known in the art that the introduction of multiple mutations in a given polypeptide can sometimes adversely affect the expression, activity, and subsequent manufacture of the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly, as demonstrated in, for example, Examples 19 and 20, it was found that the desirable properties of several FGF21 mutants could indeed be combined in an additive or synergistic fashion to generate an FGF21 mutant having enhanced pharmaceutical properties. FGF21 mutants that are resistant to proteolysis, have a reduced rate of aggregation, and which still retain activity that is the same as, or greater than, wild-type FGF21, are disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne selection criteria for identifying desirable FGF21 combination mutants was that the activity of the FGF21 mutant be similar to, or greater than, the activity of wild-type FGF21. Therefore, another embodiment of the present invention is directed to FGF21 mutants that are proteolysis-resistant and have reduced aggregation properties while still retaining an FGF21 activity that is similar to, or greater than, wild-type FGF21. Although less desirable in some cases, FGF21 mutants that are proteolysis-resistant and have reduced aggregation properties but exhibit somewhat decreased FGF21 activity form another embodiment of the present invention. In some cases it may be desirable to maintain a degree of proteolysis and/or aggregation, and consequently, FGF21 mutants that allow some degree of proteolysis and/or aggregation also form another embodiment of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs with all FGF21 mutants of the present invention, the FGF21 combination mutants of the present invention can be prepared as described herein. Those of ordinary skill in the art, familiar with standard molecular biology techniques, can employ that knowledge, coupled with the instant disclosure, to make and use the FGF21 combination mutants of the present invention. Standard techniques can be used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, tissue culture, and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). See, e.g., Sambrook et al., \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual\n, supra, which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques can be performed according to manufacturer's specifications, as commonly accomplished in the art, or as described herein. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses; chemical analyses; pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery; and treatment of patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe FGF21 combination mutants of the present invention can be fused to another entity, which can impart additional properties to the FGF21 combination mutant. In one embodiment of the present invention, an FGF21 combination mutant can be fused to an IgG Fc sequence, e.g., SEQ ID NO:13. Such fusion can be accomplished using known molecular biological methods and/or the guidance provided herein. The benefits of such fusion polypeptides, as well as methods for making such fusion polypeptides, are discussed in more detail herein.\n\n\n \n7. FGF21 FUSION PROTEINS\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “FGF21 fusion polypeptide” or “FGF21 fusion protein” refers to a fusion of one or more amino acid residues (such as a heterologous protein or peptide) at the N-terminus or C-terminus of any FGF21 polypeptide mutant described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeterologous peptides and polypeptides include, but are not limited to, an epitope to allow for the detection and/or isolation of an FGF21 polypeptide mutant; a transmembrane receptor protein or a portion thereof, such as an extracellular domain or a transmembrane and intracellular domain; a ligand or a portion thereof which binds to a transmembrane receptor protein; an enzyme or portion thereof which is catalytically active; a polypeptide or peptide which promotes oligomerization, such as a leucine zipper domain; a polypeptide or peptide which increases stability, such as an immunoglobulin constant region; a functional or non-functional antibody, or a heavy or light chain thereof; and a polypeptide which has an activity, such as a therapeutic activity, different from the FGF21 polypeptide mutants of the present invention. Also encompassed by the present invention are FGF21 mutants fused to human serum albumin (HSA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFGF21 fusion proteins can be made by fusing heterologous sequences at either the N-terminus or at the C-terminus of an FGF21 polypeptide mutant. As described herein, a heterologous sequence can be an amino acid sequence or a non-amino acid-containing polymer. Heterologous sequences can be fused either directly to the FGF21 polypeptide mutant or via a linker or adapter molecule. A linker or adapter molecule can be one or more amino acid residues (or -mers), e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 residues (or -mers), preferably from 10 to 50 amino acid residues (or -mers), e.g., 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50 residues (or -mers), and more preferably from 15 to 35 amino acid residues (or -mers). A linker or adapter molecule can also be designed with a cleavage site for a DNA restriction endonuclease or for a protease to allow for the separation of the fused moieties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \na. Fc Fusions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, an FGF21 polypeptide mutant is fused to one or more domains of an Fc region of human IgG. Antibodies comprise two functionally independent parts, a variable domain known as “Fab,” that binds an antigen, and a constant domain known as “Fc,” that is involved in effector functions such as complement activation and attack by phagocytic cells. An Fc has a long serum half-life, whereas a Fab is short-lived (Capon et al., 1989, \nNature \n337: 525-31). When joined together with a therapeutic protein, an Fc domain can provide longer half-life or incorporate such functions as Fc receptor binding, protein A binding, complement fixation, and perhaps even placental transfer (Capon et al., 1989).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vivo pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that human FGF21 has a short half-life of about 1 hour in mice due to rapid clearance and in vivo degradation. Therefore, to extend the half-life of FGF21 an Fc sequence was fused to the N- or C-terminal end of the FGF21 polypeptide. The fusion of an Fc region to wild type FGF21, in particularly Fc fused to the N-terminus of wild type FGF21, did not extend the half-life as expected, however, which led to an investigation of the proteolytic degradation of FGF21 in vivo and the identification of FGF21 mutants that were resistant to such degradation. Such mutants are described in, for example, Examples 8 and 11, and exhibit longer half-lives than wild-type FGF21. These and other FGF21 fusion proteins form embodiments of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout the disclosure, Fc-FGF21 refers to a fusion protein in which the Fc sequence is fused to the N-terminus of FGF21. Similarly, throughout the disclosure, FGF21-Fc refers to a fusion protein in which the Fc sequence is fused to the C-terminus of FGF21.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting FGF21 fusion protein can be purified, for example, by the use of a Protein A affinity column. Peptides and proteins fused to an Fc region have been found to exhibit a substantially greater half-life in vivo than the unfused counterpart. Also, a fusion to an Fc region allows for dimerization/multimerization of the fusion polypeptide. The Fc region can be a naturally occurring Fc region, or can be altered to improve certain qualities, such as therapeutic qualities, circulation time, or reduced aggregation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful modifications of protein therapeutic agents by fusion with the “Fc” domain of an antibody are discussed in detail in International Publication No. WO 00/024782, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. This document discusses linkage to a “vehicle” such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), dextran, or an Fc region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nb. Fusion Protein Linkers\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen forming the fusion proteins of the present invention, a linker can, but need not, be employed. When present, the linker's chemical structure may not critical, since it serves primarily as a spacer. The linker can be made up of amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. In some embodiments of the present invention, the linker is made up of from 1 to 20 amino acids linked by peptide bonds, wherein the amino acids are selected from the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. In various embodiments, the 1 to 20 amino acids are selected from the amino acids glycine, serine, alanine, proline, asparagine, glutamine, and lysine. In some embodiments, a linker is made up of a majority of amino acids that are sterically unhindered, such as glycine and alanine. In some embodiments, linkers are polyglycines (such as (Gly)\n4 \n(SEQ ID NO:29) and (Gly)\n5 \n(SEQ ID NO:30)), polyalanines, combinations of glycine and alanine (such as poly(Gly-Ala)), or combinations of glycine and serine (such as poly(Gly-Ser)). Other suitable linkers include: (Gly)\n5\n-Ser-(Gly)\n3\n-Ser-(Gly)\n4\n-Ser (SEQ ID NO:23), (Gly)\n4\n-Ser-(Gly)\n4\n-Ser-(Gly)\n4\n-Ser (SEQ ID NO:31), (Gly)\n3\n-Lys-(Gly)\n4 \n(SEQ ID NO:32), (Gly)\n3\n-Asn-Gly-Ser-(Gly)\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:33), (Gly)\n3\n-Cys-(Gly)\n4 \n(SEQ ID NO:34), and Gly-Pro-Asn-Gly-Gly (SEQ ID NO:35). While a linker of 15 amino acid residues has been found to work particularly well for FGF21 fusion proteins, the present invention contemplates linkers of any length or composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe linkers described herein are exemplary, and linkers that are much longer and which include other residues are contemplated by the present invention. Non-peptide linkers are also contemplated by the present invention. For example, alkyl linkers such as —NH—(CH\n2\n)\nS\n—C(O)—, wherein s=2 to 20, could be used. These alkyl linkers can further be substituted by any non-sterically hindering group, including, but not limited to, a lower alkyl (e.g., C1-C6), lower acyl, halogen (e.g., Cl, Br), CN, NH\n2\n, or phenyl. An exemplary non-peptide linker is a polyethylene glycol linker, wherein the linker has a molecular weight of 100 to 5000 kD, for example, 100 to 500 kD.\n\n\n \n8. CHEMICALLY-MODIFIED FGF21 MUTANTS\n\n\n \n \n \nChemically modified forms of the FGF21 polypeptide mutants described herein, including the truncated forms of FGF21 described herein, can be prepared by one skilled in the art, given the disclosures described herein. Such chemically modified FGF21 mutants are altered such that the chemically modified FGF21 mutant is different from the unmodified FGF21 mutant, either in the type or location of the molecules naturally attached to the FGF21 mutant. Chemically modified FGF21 mutants can include molecules formed by the deletion of one or more naturally-attached chemical groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, FGF21 polypeptide mutants of the present invention can be modified by the covalent attachment of one or more polymers. For example, the polymer selected is typically water-soluble so that the protein to which it is attached does not precipitate in an aqueous environment, such as a physiological environment. Included within the scope of suitable polymers is a mixture of polymers. Preferably, for therapeutic use of the end-product preparation, the polymer will be pharmaceutically acceptable. Non-water soluble polymers conjugated to FGF21 polypeptide mutants of the present invention also form an aspect of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary polymers each can be of any molecular weight and can be branched or unbranched. The polymers each typically have an average molecular weight of between about 2 kDa to about 100 kDa (the term “about” indicating that in preparations of a water-soluble polymer, some molecules will weigh more and some less than the stated molecular weight). The average molecular weight of each polymer is preferably between about 5 kDa and about 50 kDa, more preferably between about 12 kDa and about 40 kDa, and most preferably between about 20 kDa and about 35 kDa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable water-soluble polymers or mixtures thereof include, but are not limited to, N-linked or O-linked carbohydrates, sugars, phosphates, polyethylene glycol (PEG) (including the forms of PEG that have been used to derivatize proteins, including mono-(C\n1\n-C\n10\n), alkoxy-, or aryloxy-polyethylene glycol), monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, dextran (such as low molecular weight dextran of, for example, about 6 kD), cellulose, or other carbohydrate based polymers, poly-(N-vinyl pyrrolidone) polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol homopolymers, polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymers, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), and polyvinyl alcohol. Also encompassed by the present invention are bifunctional crosslinking molecules that can be used to prepare covalently attached FGF21 polypeptide mutant multimers. Also encompassed by the present invention are FGF21 mutants covalently attached to polysialic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the present invention, an FGF21 mutant is covalently, or chemically, modified to include one or more water-soluble polymers, including, but not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyoxyethylene glycol, or polypropylene glycol. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192; and 4,179,337. In some embodiments of the present invention, an FGF21 mutant comprises one or more polymers, including, but not limited to, monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, dextran, cellulose, another carbohydrate-based polymer, poly-(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)-polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol homopolymers, a polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymer, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, or mixtures of such polymers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the present invention, an FGF21 mutant is covalently-modified with PEG subunits. In some embodiments, one or more water-soluble polymers are bonded at one or more specific positions (for example, at the N-terminus) of the FGF21 mutant. In some embodiments, one or more water-soluble polymers are randomly attached to one or more side chains of an FGF21 mutant. In some embodiments, PEG is used to improve the therapeutic capacity of an FGF21 mutant. Certain such methods are discussed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,133,426, which is hereby incorporated by reference for any purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn embodiments of the present invention wherein the polymer is PEG, the PEG group can be of any convenient molecular weight, and can be linear or branched. The average molecular weight of the PEG group will preferably range from about 2 kD to about 100 kDa, and more preferably from about 5 kDa to about 50 kDa, e.g., 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 kDa. The PEG groups will generally be attached to the FGF21 mutant via acylation or reductive alkylation through a reactive group on the PEG moiety (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, thiol, or ester group) to a reactive group on the FGF21 mutant (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, or ester group).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PEGylation of a polypeptide, including the FGF21 mutants of the present invention, can be specifically carried out using any of the PEGylation reactions known in the art. Such reactions are described, for example, in the following references: Francis et al., 1992, \nFocus on Growth Factors \n3: 4-10; European Patent Nos. 0 154 316 and 0 401 384; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,337. For example, PEGylation can be carried out via an acylation reaction or an alkylation reaction with a reactive polyethylene glycol molecule (or an analogous reactive water-soluble polymer) as described herein. For the acylation reactions, a selected polymer should have a single reactive ester group. For reductive alkylation, a selected polymer should have a single reactive aldehyde group. A reactive aldehyde is, for example, polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, which is water stable, or mono C\n1\n-C\n10 \nalkoxy or aryloxy derivatives thereof (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,714).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the present invention, a useful strategy for the attachment of the PEG group to a polypeptide involves combining, through the formation of a conjugate linkage in solution, a peptide and a PEG moiety, each bearing a special functionality that is mutually reactive toward the other. The peptides can be easily prepared with conventional solid phase synthesis. The peptides are “preactivated” with an appropriate functional group at a specific site. The precursors are purified and fully characterized prior to reacting with the PEG moiety. Ligation of the peptide with PEG usually takes place in aqueous phase and can be easily monitored by reverse phase analytical HPLC. The PEGylated peptides can be easily purified by preparative HPLC and characterized by analytical HPLC, amino acid analysis and laser desorption mass spectrometry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolysaccharide polymers are another type of water-soluble polymer that can be used for protein modification. Therefore, the FGF21 mutants of the present invention fused to a polysaccharide polymer form embodiments of the present invention. Dextrans are polysaccharide polymers comprised of individual subunits of glucose predominantly linked by alpha 1-6 linkages. The dextran itself is available in many molecular weight ranges, and is readily available in molecular weights from about 1 kD to about 70 kD. Dextran is a suitable water-soluble polymer for use as a vehicle by itself or in combination with another vehicle (e.g., Fc). See, e.g., International Publication No. WO 96/11953. The use of dextran conjugated to therapeutic or diagnostic immunoglobulins has been reported. See, e.g., European Patent Publication No. 0 315 456, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The present invention also encompasses the use of dextran of about 1 kD to about 20 kD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, chemical modification can be performed under any suitable condition used to react a protein with an activated polymer molecule. Methods for preparing chemically modified polypeptides will generally comprise the steps of: (a) reacting the polypeptide with the activated polymer molecule (such as a reactive ester or aldehyde derivative of the polymer molecule) under conditions whereby a FGF21 polypeptide mutant becomes attached to one or more polymer molecules, and (b) obtaining the reaction products. The optimal reaction conditions will be determined based on known parameters and the desired result. For example, the larger the ratio of polymer molecules to protein, the greater the percentage of attached polymer molecule. In one embodiment of the present invention, chemically modified FGF21 mutants can have a single polymer molecule moiety at the amino-terminus (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,234,784)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, FGF21 polypeptide mutants can be chemically coupled to biotin. The biotin/FGF21 polypeptide mutants are then allowed to bind to avidin, resulting in tetravalent avidin/biotin/FGF21 polypeptide mutants. FGF21 polypeptide mutants can also be covalently coupled to dinitrophenol (DNP) or trinitrophenol (TNP) and the resulting conjugates precipitated with anti-DNP or anti-TNP-IgM to form decameric conjugates with a valency of 10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, conditions that can be alleviated or modulated by the administration of the present chemically modified FGF21 mutants include those described herein for FGF21 polypeptide mutants. However, the chemically modified FGF21 mutants disclosed herein can have additional activities, enhanced or reduced biological activity, or other characteristics, such as increased or decreased half-life, as compared to unmodified FGF21 mutants.\n\n\n \n9. THERAPEUTIC COMPOSITIONS OF FGF21 MUTANTS AND ADMINISTRATION THEREOF\n\n\n \n \n \nTherapeutic compositions comprising FGF21 mutants are within the scope of the present invention, and are specifically contemplated in light of the identification of several mutant FGF21 sequences exhibiting enhanced properties. Such FGF21 mutant pharmaceutical compositions can comprise a therapeutically effective amount of an FGF21 polypeptide mutant in admixture with a pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable formulation agent selected for suitability with the mode of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcceptable formulation materials preferably are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition can contain formulation materials for modifying, maintaining, or preserving, for example, the pH, osmolarity, viscosity, clarity, color, isotonicity, odor, sterility, stability, rate of dissolution or release, adsorption, or penetration of the composition. Suitable formulation materials include, but are not limited to, amino acids (such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine, or lysine), antimicrobials, antioxidants (such as ascorbic acid, sodium sulfite, or sodium hydrogen-sulfite), buffers (such as borate, bicarbonate, Tris-HCl, citrates, phosphates, or other organic acids), bulking agents (such as mannitol or glycine), chelating agents (such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)), complexing agents (such as caffeine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, beta-cyclodextrin, or hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin), fillers, monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates (such as glucose, mannose, or dextrins), proteins (such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins), coloring, flavoring and diluting agents, emulsifying agents, hydrophilic polymers (such as polyvinylpyrrolidone), low molecular weight polypeptides, salt-forming counterions (such as sodium), preservatives (such as benzalkonium chloride, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, thimerosal, phenethyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, chlorhexidine, sorbic acid, or hydrogen peroxide), solvents (such as glycerin, propylene glycol, or polyethylene glycol), sugar alcohols (such as mannitol or sorbitol), suspending agents, surfactants or wetting agents (such as pluronics; PEG; sorbitan esters; polysorbates such as polysorbate 20 or polysorbate 80; triton; tromethamine; lecithin; cholesterol or tyloxapal), stability enhancing agents (such as sucrose or sorbitol), tonicity enhancing agents (such as alkali metal halides—preferably sodium or potassium chloride—or mannitol sorbitol), delivery vehicles, diluents, excipients and/or pharmaceutical adjuvants (see, e.g., \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n(18th Ed., A. R. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Company 1990), and subsequent editions of the same, incorporated herein by reference for any purpose).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe optimal pharmaceutical composition will be determined by a skilled artisan depending upon, for example, the intended route of administration, delivery format, and desired dosage (see, e.g., \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\n, supra). Such compositions can influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of the FGF21 polypeptide mutant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe primary vehicle or carrier in a pharmaceutical composition can be either aqueous or non-aqueous in nature. For example, a suitable vehicle or carrier for injection can be water, physiological saline solution, or artificial cerebrospinal fluid, possibly supplemented with other materials common in compositions for parenteral administration. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles. Other exemplary pharmaceutical compositions comprise Tris buffer of about pH 7.0-8.5, or acetate buffer of about pH 4.0-5.5, which can further include sorbitol or a suitable substitute. In one embodiment of the present invention, FGF21 polypeptide mutant compositions can be prepared for storage by mixing the selected composition having the desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents (\nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\n, supra) in the form of a lyophilized cake or an aqueous solution. Further, the FGF21 polypeptide mutant product can be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipients such as sucrose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe FGF21 polypeptide mutant pharmaceutical compositions can be selected for parenteral delivery. Alternatively, the compositions can be selected for inhalation or for delivery through the digestive tract, such as orally. The preparation of such pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is within the skill of the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulation components are present in concentrations that are acceptable to the site of administration. For example, buffers are used to maintain the composition at physiological pH or at a slightly lower pH, typically within a pH range of from about 5 to about 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen parenteral administration is contemplated, the therapeutic compositions for use in this invention can be in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable, aqueous solution comprising the desired FGF21 polypeptide mutant in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. A particularly suitable vehicle for parenteral injection is sterile distilled water in which an FGF21 polypeptide mutant is formulated as a sterile, isotonic solution, properly preserved. Yet another preparation can involve the formulation of the desired molecule with an agent, such as injectable microspheres, bio-erodible particles, polymeric compounds (such as polylactic acid or polyglycolic acid), beads, or liposomes, that provides for the controlled or sustained release of the product which can then be delivered via a depot injection. Hyaluronic acid can also be used, and this can have the effect of promoting sustained duration in the circulation. Other suitable means for the introduction of the desired molecule include implantable drug delivery devices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition can be formulated for inhalation. For example, an FGF21 polypeptide mutant can be formulated as a dry powder for inhalation. FGF21 polypeptide mutant inhalation solutions can also be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery. In yet another embodiment, solutions can be nebulized. Pulmonary administration is further described in International Publication No. WO 94/20069, which describes the pulmonary delivery of chemically modified proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also contemplated that certain formulations can be administered orally. In one embodiment of the present invention, FGF21 polypeptide mutants that are administered in this fashion can be formulated with or without those carriers customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. For example, a capsule can be designed to release the active portion of the formulation at the point in the gastrointestinal tract when bioavailability is maximized and pre-systemic degradation is minimized. Additional agents can be included to facilitate absorption of the FGF21 polypeptide mutant. Diluents, flavorings, low melting point waxes, vegetable oils, lubricants, suspending agents, tablet disintegrating agents, and binders can also be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother pharmaceutical composition can involve an effective quantity of FGF21 polypeptide mutants in a mixture with non-toxic excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. By dissolving the tablets in sterile water, or another appropriate vehicle, solutions can be prepared in unit-dose form. Suitable excipients include, but are not limited to, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or bicarbonate, lactose, or calcium phosphate; or binding agents, such as starch, gelatin, or acacia; or lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or talc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional FGF21 polypeptide mutant pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those skilled in the art, including formulations involving FGF21 polypeptide mutants in sustained- or controlled-delivery formulations. Techniques for formulating a variety of other sustained- or controlled-delivery means, such as liposome carriers, bio-erodible microparticles or porous beads and depot injections, are also known to those skilled in the art (see, e.g., International Publication No. WO 93/15722, which describes the controlled release of porous polymeric microparticles for the delivery of pharmaceutical compositions, and Wischke & Schwendeman, 2008, \nInt. J. Pharm. \n364: 298-327, and Freiberg & Zhu, 2004, \nInt. J. Pharm. \n282: 1-18, which discuss microsphere/microparticle preparation and use).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices can include polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919 and European Patent No. 0 058 481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., 1983, \nBiopolymers \n22: 547-56), poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) (Langer et al., 1981, \nJ. Biomed. Mater. Res. \n15: 167-277 and Langer, 1982, \nChem. Tech. \n12: 98-105), ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra) or poly-D(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (European Patent No. 0 133 988). Sustained-release compositions can also include liposomes, which can be prepared by any of several methods known in the art. See, e.g., Epstein et al., 1985, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n82: 3688-92; and European Patent Nos. 0 036 676, 0 088 046, and 0 143 949.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe FGF21 polypeptide mutant pharmaceutical composition to be used for in vivo administration typically must be sterile. This can be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. Where the composition is lyophilized, sterilization using this method can be conducted either prior to, or following, lyophilization and reconstitution. The composition for parenteral administration can be stored in lyophilized form or in a solution. In addition, parenteral compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the pharmaceutical composition has been formulated, it can be stored in sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or as a dehydrated or lyophilized powder. Such formulations can be stored either in a ready-to-use form or in a form (e.g., lyophilized) requiring reconstitution prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the present invention is directed to kits for producing a single-dose administration unit. The kits can each contain both a first container having a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous formulation. Also included within the scope of this invention are kits containing single and multi-chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and lyosyringes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective amount of an FGF21 polypeptide mutant pharmaceutical composition to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for treatment will thus vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the indication for which the FGF21 polypeptide mutant is being used, the route of administration, and the size (body weight, body surface, or organ size) and condition (the age and general health) of the patient. Accordingly, the clinician can titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. A typical dosage can range from about 0.1 μg/kg to up to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In other embodiments, the dosage can range from 0.1 μg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 1 μg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 5 μg/kg, 10 μg/kg, 15 μg/kg, 20 μg/kg, 25 μg/kg, 30 μg/kg, 35 μg/kg, 40 μg/kg, 45 μg/kg, 50 μg/kg, 55 μg/kg, 60 μg/kg, 65 μg/kg, 70 μg/kg, 75 μg/kg, up to about 100 mg/kg. In yet other embodiments, the dosage can be 50 μg/kg, 100 μg/kg, 150 μg/kg, 200 μg/kg, 250 μg/kg, 300 μg/kg, 350 μg/kg, 400 μg/kg, 450 μg/kg, 500 μg/kg, 550 μg/kg, 600 μg/kg, 650 μg/kg, 700 μg/kg, 750 μg/kg, 800 μg/kg, 850 μg/kg, 900 μg/kg, 950 μg/kg, 100 μg/kg, 200 μg/kg, 300 μg/kg, 400 μg/kg, 500 μg/kg, 600 μg/kg, 700 μg/kg, 800 μg/kg, 900 μg/kg, 1000 μg/kg, 2000 μg/kg, 3000 μg/kg, 4000 μg/kg, 5000 μg/kg, 6000 μg/kg, 7000 μg/kg, 8000 μg/kg, 9000 μg/kg or 10 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe frequency of dosing will depend upon the pharmacokinetic parameters of the FGF21 polypeptide mutant in the formulation being used. Typically, a clinician will administer the composition until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The composition can therefore be administered as a single dose, as two or more doses (which may or may not contain the same amount of the desired molecule) over time, or as a continuous infusion via an implantation device or catheter. Further refinement of the appropriate dosage is routinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art and is within the ambit of tasks routinely performed by them. Appropriate dosages can be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is in accord with known methods, e.g., orally; through injection by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intraparenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial, intraportal, or intralesional routes; by sustained release systems (which may also be injected); or by implantation devices. Where desired, the compositions can be administered by bolus injection or continuously by infusion, or by implantation device.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively or additionally, the composition can be administered locally via implantation of a membrane, sponge, or other appropriate material onto which the desired molecule has been absorbed or encapsulated. Where an implantation device is used, the device can be implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery of the desired molecule can be via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or continuous administration.\n\n\n \n10. THERAPEUTIC USES OF FGF21 POLYPEPTIDE MUTANTS\n\n\n \n \n \nFGF21 polypeptide mutants can be used to treat, diagnose, ameliorate, or prevent a number of diseases, disorders, or conditions, including, but not limited to metabolic disorders. In one embodiment, the metabolic disorder to be treated is diabetes, e.g., \ntype\n 2 diabetes. In another embodiment, the metabolic disorder is obesity. Other embodiments include metabolic conditions or disorders such as dyslipidimia; hypertension; hepatosteaotosis, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); cardiovascular disease, such as atherosclerosis; and aging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn application, a disorder or condition such as diabetes or obesity can be treated by administering an FGF21 polypeptide mutant as described herein to a patient in need thereof in the amount of a therapeutically effective dose. The administration can be performed as described herein, such as by IV injection, intraperitoneal injection, intramuscular injection, or orally in the form of a tablet or liquid formation. In most situations, a desired dosage can be determined by a clinician, as described herein, and can represent a therapeutically effective dose of the FGF21 mutant polypeptide. It will be apparent to those of skill in the art that a therapeutically effective dose of FGF21 mutant polypeptide will depend, inter alia, upon the administration schedule, the unit dose of antigen administered, whether the nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide is administered in combination with other therapeutic agents, the immune status and the health of the recipient. The term “therapeutically effective dose,” as used herein, means that amount of FGF21 mutant polypeptide that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue system, animal, or human being sought by a researcher, medical doctor, or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated.\n\n\n \n11. ANTIBODIES\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies and antibody fragments that specifically bind to the FGF21 mutant polypeptides of the present invention but do not specifically bind to wild-type FGF21 polypeptides are contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention. The antibodies can be polyclonal, including monospecific polyclonal; monoclonal (MAbs); recombinant; chimeric; humanized, such as complementarity-determining region (CDR)-grafted; human; single chain; and/or bispecific; as well as fragments; variants; or chemically modified molecules thereof. Antibody fragments include those portions of the antibody that specifically bind to an epitope on an FGF21 mutant polypeptide. Examples of such fragments include Fab and F(ab′) fragments generated by enzymatic cleavage of full-length antibodies. Other binding fragments include those generated by recombinant DNA techniques, such as the expression of recombinant plasmids containing nucleic acid sequences encoding antibody variable regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolyclonal antibodies directed toward an FGF21 mutant polypeptide generally are produced in animals (e.g., rabbits or mice) by means of multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections of the FGF21 mutant polypeptide and an adjuvant. It can be useful to conjugate an FGF21 mutant polypeptide to a carrier protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum, albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor. Also, aggregating agents such as alum are used to enhance the immune response. After immunization, the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for anti-FGF21 mutant antibody titer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies directed toward FGF21 mutant polypeptides can be produced using any method that provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture. Examples of suitable methods for preparing monoclonal antibodies include the hybridoma methods of Kohler et al., 1975, \nNature \n256: 495-97 and the human B-cell hybridoma method (Kozbor, 1984, \nJ. Immunol. \n133: 3001; Brodeur et al., \nMonoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications \n51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1987). Also provided by the invention are hybridoma cell lines that produce monoclonal antibodies reactive with FGF21 mutant polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies of the invention can be modified for use as therapeutics. In one embodiment, the monoclonal antibody is a “chimeric” antibody in which a portion of the heavy (H) and/or light (L) chain is identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is/are identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. Also included are fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., 1985, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n81: 6851-55.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a monoclonal antibody of the invention is a “humanized” antibody. Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,585,089 and 5,693,762. Generally, a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source that is non-human. Humanization can be performed, for example, using methods described in the art (see, e.g., Jones et al., 1986, \nNature \n321: 522-25; Riechmann et al., 1998, \nNature \n332: 323-27; Verhoeyen et al., 1988, \nScience \n239: 1534-36), by substituting at least a portion of a rodent complementarity-determining region for the corresponding regions of a human antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso encompassed by the invention are human antibodies that bind the FGF21 mutant polypeptides of the present invention. Using transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production such antibodies are produced by immunization with an FGF21 mutant antigen (i.e., having at least 6 contiguous amino acids), optionally conjugated to a carrier. See, e.g., Jakobovits et al., 1993, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n90: 2551-55; Jakobovits et al., 1993, \nNature \n362: 255-58; Bruggermann et al., 1993, \nYear in Immuno. \n7: 33. In one method, such transgenic animals are produced by incapacitating the endogenous loci encoding the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains therein, and inserting loci encoding human heavy and light chain proteins into the genome thereof. Partially modified animals, i.e., animals having less than the full complement of modifications, are then cross-bred to obtain an animal having all of the desired immune system modifications. When administered an immunogen, these transgenic animals produce antibodies with human (rather than, e.g., murine) amino acid sequences, including variable regions that are immunospecific for these antigens. See, e.g., International Publication Nos. WO 96/33735 and WO 94/02602. Additional methods are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,807, International Publication Nos. WO 91/10741 and WO 90/04036, and in European Patent No. 0 546 073. Human antibodies can also be produced by the expression of recombinant DNA in host cells or by expression in hybridoma cells as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative embodiment, human antibodies can also be produced from phage-display libraries (see, e.g., Hoogenboom et al., 1991, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n227: 381; Marks et al., 1991, \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222: 581). These processes mimic immune selection through the display of antibody repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, and subsequent selection of phage by their binding to an antigen of choice. One such technique is described in International Publication No. WO 99/10494, which describes the isolation of high affinity and functional agonistic antibodies for MPL- and msk-receptors using such an approach.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimeric, CDR grafted, and humanized antibodies are typically produced by recombinant methods. Nucleic acids encoding the antibodies are introduced into host cells and expressed using materials and procedures described herein. In one embodiment, the antibodies are produced in mammalian host cells, such as CHO cells. Monoclonal (e.g., human) antibodies can be produced by the expression of recombinant DNA in host cells or by expression in hybridoma cells as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-FGF21 mutant antibodies of the invention can be employed in any known assay method, such as competitive binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays (see, e.g., Sola, \nMonoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques \n147-158 (CRC Press, Inc., 1987), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) for the detection and quantitation of FGF21 mutant polypeptides. The antibodies will bind FGF21 mutant polypeptides with an affinity that is appropriate for the assay method being employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor diagnostic applications, in certain embodiments, anti-FGF21 mutant antibodies can be labeled with a detectable moiety. The detectable moiety can be any one that is capable of producing, either directly or indirectly, a detectable signal. For example, the detectable moiety can be a radioisotope, such as \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n125\nI, \n99\nTc, \n111\nIn, or \n67\nGa; a fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, or luciferin; or an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, or horseradish peroxidase (Bayer et al., 1990, \nMeth. Enz. \n184: 138-63).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompetitive binding assays rely on the ability of a labeled standard (e.g., an FGF21 mutant polypeptide, or an immunologically reactive portion thereof) to compete with the test sample analyte (e.g., an FGF21 mutant polypeptide) for binding with a limited amount of anti-FGF21 mutant antibody. The amount of an FGF21 mutant polypeptide in the test sample is inversely proportional to the amount of standard that becomes bound to the antibodies. To facilitate determining the amount of standard that becomes bound, the antibodies typically are insolubilized before or after the competition, so that the standard and analyte that are bound to the antibodies can conveniently be separated from the standard and analyte that remain unbound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSandwich assays typically involve the use of two antibodies, each capable of binding to a different immunogenic portion, or epitope, of the protein to be detected and/or quantitated. In a sandwich assay, the test sample analyte is typically bound by a first antibody that is immobilized on a solid support, and thereafter a second antibody binds to the analyte, thus forming an insoluble three-part complex. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110. The second antibody can itself be labeled with a detectable moiety (direct sandwich assays) or can be measured using an anti-immunoglobulin antibody that is labeled with a detectable moiety (indirect sandwich assays). For example, one type of sandwich assay is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), in which case the detectable moiety is an enzyme.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-FGF21 mutant antibodies of the present invention are also useful for in vivo imaging. An antibody labeled with a detectable moiety can be administered to an animal, preferably into the bloodstream, and the presence and location of the labeled antibody in the host assayed. The antibody can be labeled with any moiety that is detectable in an animal, whether by nuclear magnetic resonance, radiology, or other detection means known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe FGF21 mutant antibodies of the invention can be used as therapeutics. These therapeutic agents are generally agonists or antagonists, in that they either enhance or reduce, respectively, at least one of the biological activities of an FGF21 mutant polypeptide. In one embodiment, antagonist antibodies of the invention are antibodies or binding fragments thereof which are capable of specifically binding to an FGF21 mutant polypeptide and which are capable of inhibiting or eliminating the functional activity of an FGF21 mutant polypeptide in vivo or in vitro. In some embodiments, the antagonist antibody will inhibit the functional activity of an FGF21 mutant polypeptide by at least about 50%, and preferably by at least about 80%. In another embodiment, the anti-FGF21 mutant antibody is capable of interfering with the interaction between an FGF21 mutant polypeptide and an FGF receptor thereby inhibiting or eliminating FGF21 mutant polypeptide activity in vitro or in vivo. Agonist and antagonist anti-FGF21 mutant antibodies are identified by screening assays that are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to a kit comprising FGF21 mutant antibodies and other reagents useful for detecting FGF21 mutant polypeptide levels in biological samples. Such reagents can include a detectable label, blocking serum, positive and negative control samples, and detection reagents.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Examples that follow are illustrative of specific embodiments of the invention, and various uses thereof. They are set forth for explanatory purposes only, and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nPreparation of FGF21 Expression Constructs\n\n\n \n \n \nA nucleic acid sequence encoding the mature FGF21 polypeptide was obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using primers having nucleotide sequences corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the mature FGF21 sequence. Table 2 lists the primers that were used to amplify the mature FGF21 sequence.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCR Primers for Preparing FGF21 Construct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimer\n\n\nSequence\n\n\nNO:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSense\n \n\n\n5′-\nAGGAGGAATAACATATGCATCCAATTCCAGATTCTT\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCTCC-3′\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-\n\n\n5′-TAGTGAGCTCGAATTCTTAGGAAGCGTAGCTGG-3′\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe primers used to prepare the FGF21 expression construct incorporated restriction endonuclease sites for directional cloning of the sequence into a suitable expression vector (e.g., pET30 (Novagen/EMD Biosciences; San Diego, Calif.) or pAMG33 (Amgen; Thousand Oaks, Calif.)). The expression vector pAMG33 contains a low-copy number R-100 origin of replication, a modified lac promoter, and a kanamycin-resistance gene. The expression vector pET30 contains a pBR322-derived origin of replication, an inducible T7 promoter, and a kanamycin-resistance gene. While expression from pAMG33 was found to be higher, pET30 was found to be a more reliable cloning vector. Thus, the majority of the constructs described in the instant application were first generated in pET30 and then screened for efficacy. Selected sequences were then transferred to pAMG33 for further amplification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe FGF21 sequence was amplified in a reaction mixture containing 40.65 μL dH\n2\nO, 5 μL PfuUltra II Reaction Buffer (10×), 1.25 μL dNTP Mix (40 mM-4×10 mM), 0.1 μL Template (100 ng/mL), 1 μL Primer1 (10 μM), 1 μL Primer2 (10 μM), and 1 μL PfuUltra II fusion HS DNA Polymerase (Stratagene; La Jolla, Calif.). Amplification reactions were performed by heating for 2 minutes at 95° C.; followed by ten cycles at 95° C. for 20 seconds, 60° C. for 20 seconds (with an additional 1° C. subtracted per cycle), and 72° C. for 15 seconds/kilobase of desired product; followed by 20 cycles at 94° C. for 20 seconds, 55° C. for 20 seconds, and 72° C. for 15 seconds/kilobase of desired product; followed by 72° C. for 3 minutes. Amplification products were digested with the restriction endonucleases NdeI, DpnI, and EcoRI; ligated into a suitable vector; and then transformed into competent cells.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nPurification of FGF21 Proteins from Bacteria\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the Examples that follow, various FGF21 proteins, including the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide, truncated FGF21 polypeptides, FGF21 mutants, and FGF21 fusion proteins, were expressed in a bacterial expression system. After expression, which is described below, the FGF21 proteins were purified as described in this Example, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo purify the wild-type FGF21 polypeptide, truncated FGF21 polypeptides, and FGF21 mutants from bacterial inclusion bodies, double-washed inclusion bodies (DWIBs) were solubilized in a solubilization buffer containing guanidine hydrochloride and DTT in Tris buffer at pH 8.5 and then mixed for one hour at room temperature, and the solubilization mixture was added to a refold buffer containing urea, arginine, cysteine, and cystamine hydrochloride at pH 9.5 and then mixed for 24 hours at 5° C. (see, e.g., Clarke, 1998, \nCurr. Opin. Biotechnol. \n9: 157-63; Mannall et al., 2007, \nBiotechnol. Bioeng. \n97: 1523-34; Rudolph et al., 1997, “Folding proteins,” Protein Function: A Practical Approach (Creighton, ed., New York, IRL Press) 57-99; and Ishibashi et al., 2005, \nProtein Expr. Purif. \n42: 1-6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing solubilization and refolding, the mixture was filtered through a 0.45 micron filter. The refold pool was then concentrated approximately 10-fold with a 10 kD molecular weight cut-off Pall Omega cassette at a transmembrane pressure (TMP) of 20 psi, and dialfiltered with 3 column volumes of 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0 at a TMP of 20 psi.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe clarified sample was then subjected to anion exchange (AEX) chromatography using a Q Sepharose HP resin. A linear salt gradient of 0 to 250 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris was run at pH 8.0 at 5° C. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and pooled.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe AEX eluate pool was then subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) using a Phenyl Sepharose HP resin. Protein was eluted using a decreasing linear gradient of 0.7 M to 0 M ammonium sulfate at pH 8.0 and ambient temperature. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970, \nNature \n227: 680-85) and pooled.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HIC pool was concentrated with a 10 kD molecular weight cut-off Pall Omega 0.2 m\n2 \ncassette to 7 mg/mL at a TMP of 20 psi. The concentrate was dialfiltered with 5 column volumes of 10 mM KPO\n4\n, 5% sorbitol, pH 8.0 at a TMP of 20 psi, and the recovered concentrate was diluted to 5 mg/mL. Finally, the solution was filtered through a Pall mini-Kleenpac 0.2 μM Posidyne membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo purify FGF21 fusion proteins and FGF21 fusion mutant proteins from bacterial inclusion bodies, double-washed inclusion bodies (DWIBs) were solubilized in a solubilization buffer containing guanidine hydrochloride and DTT in Tris buffer at pH 8.5 and then mixed for one hour at room temperature, and the solubilization mixture was added to a refold buffer containing urea, arginine, cysteine, and cystamine hydrochloride at pH 9.5 and then mixed for 24 hours at 5° C. (see, e.g., Clarke, 1998, \nCurr. Opin. Biotechnol. \n9: 157-63; Mannall et al., 2007, \nBiotechnol. Bioeng. \n97: 1523-34; Rudolph et al., 1997, “Folding proteins,” Protein Function: A Practical Approach (Creighton, ed., New York, IRL Press) 57-99; and Ishibashi et al., 2005, \nProtein Expr. Purif. \n42: 1-6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing solubilization and refolding, the mixture was dialyzed against 5 volumes of 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0 using 10 kD dialysis tubing. The pH of the dialyzed refold was adjusted to 5.0 with 50% acetic acid, and then clarified by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 4K.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe clarified sample was then subjected to anion exchange (AEX) chromatography using a Q Sepharose HP resin. A linear salt gradient of 0 to 250 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris was run at pH 8.0 at 5° C. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970, \nNature \n227: 680-85) and pooled.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe AEX eluate pool was then subjected to hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) using a Phenyl Sepharose HP resin. Protein was eluted using a decreasing linear gradient of 0.6 M to 0 M ammonium sulfate at pH 8.0 at ambient temperature.

FGF21 mutants were harvested by centrifugation 18-20 hours after induction.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nIn Vitro Activity of Truncated FGF21 Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nExperiments were performed to identify truncated FGF21 proteins that retain wild-type FGF21 activity in an ELK-luciferase in vitro assay. Table 5 summarizes the results obtained for FGF21 proteins having truncations at the N-terminus, the C-terminus, or at both the N-terminus and C-terminus ELK-luciferase assays were performed using a recombinant human 293T kidney cell system, in which the 293T cells overexpress beta-klotho and luciferase reporter constructs. These constructs also contain sequences encoding GAL4-ELK1 and 5×UAS-Luc, a luciferase reporter driven by a promoter containing five tandem copies of the Gal4 binding site. Beta-klotho is a co-receptor that is required by FGF21 for activation of its FGF receptors and induction of intracellular signal transduction, which in turn leads to Erk and ELK phosphorylation. Luciferase activity is regulated by the level of phosphorylated Erk/ELK1, and is used to indirectly monitor and quantify FGF21 activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nELK-luciferase assays were performed by culturing the 293T cells in the presence of different concentrations of wild-type FGF21 or FGF21 mutant polypeptide for 6 hours, and then assaying the cell lysates for luciferase activity. \nFIGS. 1A-1B\n show the results of an ELK-luciferase activity assay performed on the FGF21 truncation mutants 7-181 and 8-181 (\nFIG. 1A\n) and the FGF21 truncation mutants 1-172, 1-171, 1-169, and 1-164 (\nFIG. 1B\n).

In addition, Table 5 indicates that N-terminal deletions of 7 or more amino acid residues (i.e., an N-terminally truncated FGF21 protein consisting of amino acid residues 8-181 and shorter proteins) eliminate the activity of FGF21. Not surprisingly, truncated FGF21 proteins possessing both an N-terminal truncation of 8 to 14 residues and a C-terminal truncation of 12 or 32 residues were found to lack activity in ELK-luciferase assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsistent with the data presented in Table 5, truncated FGF21 polypeptides having N-terminal truncations of fewer than 7 amino acid residues constitute embodiments of the present invention. Similarly, truncated FGF21 polypeptides having C-terminal truncations of fewer than 13 amino acid residues constitute embodiments of the present invention.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nIn Vivo Activity of Truncated FGF21 Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nFGF21 possesses a number of biological activities, including the ability to lower blood glucose, insulin, triglyceride, or cholesterol levels; reduce body weight; or improve glucose tolerance, energy expenditure, or insulin sensitivity. Truncated FGF21 polypeptides were further analyzed for in vivo FGF21 activity, by introducing the truncated FGF21 polypeptides into insulin resistant ob/ob mice, and measuring the ability of a particular truncated FGF21 polypeptide to lower blood glucose. The truncated FGF21 polypeptide to be tested was injected intraperitoneally into an 8 week old ob/ob mouse (Jackson Laboratory), and blood samples were obtained at various time points following a single injection, e.g., 0, 6, 24, 72, 120, and 168 hours after injection. Blood glucose levels were measured with a OneTouch Glucometer (LifeScan, Inc. Milpitas, Calif.), and the results expressed as a percent change of blood glucose relative to the baseline level of blood glucose (i.e., at time 0).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of one experiment are provided in \nFIG. 3\n, which shows the amount of blood glucose detected in mice injected with the FGF21 truncation mutants 8-181 and 9-181. This experiment demonstrated that truncated FGF21 fusion proteins comprising amino acid residues 8-181 exhibit blood glucose lowering activity in vivo however the activity is slightly less than the activity of wild-type FGF21 at 3 and 6 hours after injection, but that truncated FGF21 fusion proteins comprising amino acid residues 9-181 do not exhibit such activity. Thus, the in vivo analysis of truncated FGF21 polypeptides indicated that the deletion of up to 7 amino acids from the N-terminus of mature FGF21 does not abolish the molecule's biological activity (in contrast with the in vitro analysis, which suggested that the deletion of 7 amino acids from the N-terminus of mature FGF21 would abolish activity).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe differing results obtained with particular N-terminally truncated FGF21 polypeptides (e.g., FGF21 8-181) in in vitro and in vivo assays can be explained by the interaction of FGF21 with beta-klotho and FGF receptor in effecting signal transduction. In particular, FGF21 activates a dual receptor complex comprising the co-receptor beta-klotho and FGF receptor (FGFR), which initiates a signaling cascade involving tyrosine kinase. The N-terminus of FGF21 has been shown involved in binding and activation of FGFR while the C-terminus of FGF21 is required for beta-klotho interaction (Yie et al., 2009 \nFEBS Lett. \n583:19-24). The ELK-luciferase in vitro assay is performed in 293 kidney cells in which the co-receptor beta-klotho is overexpressed and FGFR is expressed at normal levels. The amount of FGFR is low in relative to that of beta-klotho and the ratio of beta-klotho to FGFR in 293 cells is therefore non-physiological, which may affect receptor complex formation and ultimately ligand binding and activation of FGFR. The 293 in vitro system appears to be more vulnerable to N-terminally truncated FGF21 polypeptides and therefore may have produced loss of activity results for a few of the N-terminally truncated mutants tested, such as FGF21 8-181. Thus, in determining whether a particular N-terminally truncated FGF21 mutant retained wild-type FGF21 activity, the activity of that FGF21 mutant in the in vivo assay was considered to be dispositive. Accordingly, truncated FGF21 polypeptides having N-terminal truncations of fewer than 8 amino acid residues are encompassed by the invention.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nPreparation and Expression of Truncated FGF21 Fusion Proteins\n\n\n \n \n \nBecause the half-life of a protein can be increased by fusing the protein to an Fc sequence, fusion proteins comprising truncated FGF21 polypeptides were prepared and analyzed. The truncated FGF21 fusion proteins listed in Table 6 were prepared from amplified FGF21 sequences by SOEing (gene splicing by overlap extension) PCR. FGF21 fusion proteins were prepared such that the Fc portion of the human immunoglobulin IgG1 gene (SEQ ID NO: 13) was fused to either the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the FGF21 protein.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruncated FGF21 Fusion Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmino Acid Residues\n\n\nFc Position\n\n\nLinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-terminus Truncations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-178\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-175\n\n\n—NH\n2\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-175\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-171\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-171\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-170\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN-terminus Truncations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-181\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-181\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-181\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-181\n\n\n—COOH\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC- and N-terminus Truncations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-175\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-175\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-171\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-171\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-170\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-178\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-175\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-175\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-174\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-172\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-171\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-171\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-171\n\n\n—\nCOOH\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, FGF21 fusion protein constructs (including those encoding truncated FGF21 fusion proteins) were prepared in a series of three amplification reactions using essentially the reaction conditions described in Example 1.

In the second reaction, a pair of primers was designed to produce a sequence containing an overlapping portion of the linker, a portion of the FGF21 coding sequence, and an EcoRI cloning site. Finally, in the third reaction, a pair of primers was designed for the purpose of linking the products of the first two reactions. An exemplary set of primers for the construction of Fc-FGF21 1-181 is listed in Table 7.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPCR Primers for Preparing Exemplary FGF21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFusion Protein Construct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimer\n\n\nSequence\n\n\nNO:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nReaction\n 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSense\n \n\n\n5′-AGGAGGAATAACATATGGACAAAACTCACACATG-3′\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-\n\n\n5′-GGATCCACCACCACCGCTACCAC-3′\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nsense\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaction\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSense\n \n\n\n5′-GGTGGTGGTGGATCCCATCCAATTCCAGATTCTTC\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTCCA-3′\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-\n\n\n5′-TAGTGAGCTCGAATTCTTAGGAAGCGTAGCTGG-3′\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nsense\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaction\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSense\n \n\n\n5′-AGGAGGAATAACATATGGACAAAACTCACACATG-3′\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-\n\n\n5′-TAGTGAGCTCGAATTCTTAGGAAGCGTAGCTGG-3′\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe product of the final reaction was digested with the restriction endonucleases NdeI and EcoRI, ligated into the pET30 vector, and then transformed into competent cells.

Truncated FGF21 fusion proteins were prepared by fusing an IgG1 Fc molecule to either the N-terminal or C-terminal end of a truncated FGF21 protein to form a single contiguous sequence. To distinguish between N-terminal and C-terminal fusions, FGF21 fusion proteins in which the Fc molecule was fused to the N-terminal end of the FGF21 protein are designated as Fc-FGF21, and fusion proteins in which the Fc molecule was fused to the C-terminal end of the FGF21 protein are designated as FGF21-Fc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFGF21 possesses a number of biological activities, including the ability to lower blood glucose, insulin, triglyceride, or cholesterol levels; reduce body weight; or improve glucose tolerance, energy expenditure, or insulin sensitivity. To assess in vivo FGF21 activity, FGF21 polypeptides, FGF21 mutant polypeptides, and FGF21 fusion polypeptides were introduced into insulin resistant ob/ob mice, and the ability of a particular FGF21 protein to lower blood glucose levels was measured. The FGF21 polypeptide, FGF21 mutant polypeptide, or FGF21 fusion polypeptide to be tested was injected intraperitoneally into 8 week old ob/ob mice (Jackson Laboratory), and blood samples were obtained at various time points following a single injection, e.g., 0, 6, 24, 72, 120, and 168 hours after injection. Blood glucose levels were measured with a OneTouch Glucometer (LifeScan, Inc. Milpitas, Calif.), and the results expressed as a percent change of blood glucose relative to the baseline level of blood glucose (i.e., at time 0).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of one experiment are provided in \nFIG. 4\n, which shows the percent change in blood glucose levels observed in mice injected with a PBS control, a wild-type Fc-FGF21 control comprising amino acid residues 1-181, or truncated Fc-FGF21 fusion proteins comprising amino acid residues 5-181 or 7-181. This experiment demonstrated that truncated Fc-FGF21 fusion proteins comprising amino acid residues 5-181 or 7-181 exhibit blood glucose lowering activity that is similar to the activity of wild-type Fc-FGF21 at 6 hours after injection. Thus, the in vivo analysis of truncated FGF21 polypeptides indicated that the deletion of up to 6 amino acids from the N-terminus of mature FGF21 does not affect the molecule's biological activity. In vivo analysis also indicated, however, that the ability of truncated FGF21 polypeptides to lower blood glucose was reduced and that blood glucose levels returned to baseline at 24 hours after injection (similar results were obtained with wild-type FGF21). The short in vivo activity was found to be a result of the proteolytic degradation of FGF21, as described in Example 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of another experiment are provided in \nFIG. 5\n, which shows the percent change in blood glucose levels observed in mice injected with a PBS control, a wild-type FGF21-Fc control comprising amino acid residues 1-181, a truncated FGF21-Fc fusion protein comprising residues 1-175, or a truncated Fc-FGF21 protein comprising amino acid residues 1-171. This experiment demonstrates that the wild-type FGF21-Fc comprising amino acid residues 1-181 has a sustained glucose-lowering activity resulting in a reduction of blood glucose levels of approximately 30% over the time period of 24 hours to 120 hours following injection. The truncated Fc-FGF21 protein comprising amino acid residues 1-171 exhibits delayed blood glucose lowering activity evident only at 72 hours after injection. However, the activity observed is the same as the activity of wild-type FGF21-Fc. The truncated FGF21-Fc fusion protein comprising residues 1-175 is not active in vivo in lowering blood glucose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCollectively, the truncation experiments described herein demonstrate that truncated FGF21 fusion proteins having an N-terminal truncation exhibit blood glucose lowering activity that is similar to that of the wild-type FGF21 fusion protein, and further, that truncated FGF21 fusion proteins in which the Fc molecule has been fused to the N-terminal end of the truncated FGF21 protein exhibit more activity than fusion proteins in which the Fc molecule has been fused to the C-terminal end of the truncated FGF21 protein.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nObserved In Vivo Degradation of FGF21\n\n\n \n \n \nFGF21 degradation was first observed with FGF21 Fc fusion protein constructs as described in Example 7. In vivo pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that human FGF21 has a short half-life of about 1 hour in mice due to rapid clearance and in vivo degradation. Therefore, to extend the half-life of FGF21 an Fc sequence was fused to the N- or C-terminal end of the FGF21 polypeptide. However, the fusion of an Fc region did not completely resolve the half-life issue since fusion proteins in which an Fc sequence was fused to the N- or C-terminal end of the FGF21 polypeptide (and in particular Fc-FGF21 fusions, i.e., in which the Fc sequence is fused to the N-terminus of mature FGF21), did not exhibit the expected in vivo efficacy, and instead were found to maintain blood glucose lowering activity for no more than 24 hours in ob/ob mice. As described in \nFIG. 4\n, Fc-FGF21 fusion proteins reduced blood glucose levels by about 30-40% at 6 hours after injection, while the blood glucose levels returned to baseline levels at 24 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe proteolytic degradation of wild-type FGF21 was subsequently investigated, and the rapid loss of in vivo activity with Fc-FGF21 fusion proteins was found to be the result of in vivo degradation of FGF21. Proteolytic degradation leads to decreased biological activity of the molecule in vivo and thus a shorter effective half-life, and such degradation adversely impacts the therapeutic use of that molecule. Accordingly, the observed degradation of FGF21 Fc fusion proteins led to the investigation of the proteolytic degradation of FGF21 in vivo and to identify FGF21 mutants that were resistant to such degradation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine the sites of degradation, LC-MS analysis and Edman sequencing was performed on wild-type human FGF21 and FGF21 Fc fusion proteins obtained at various time points after injection into male C57B6 mice. The Edman sequencing helped confirm whether the N-terminal or C-terminal end of the protein was undergoing degradation. When an Fc sequence was fused to the N-terminus of human FGF21, degradation was found to occur at the peptide bond between amino acid residues 151 and 152 and between amino acid residues 171 and 172 of the human FGF21 portion of the fusion molecule (the residue numbering above is based on the mature FGF21 sequence and does not include the Fc portion of the fusion protein). The degradation at 171-172 was found to occur first, and was followed by degradation at 151-152. Degradation at 171-172 appears to be the rate-limiting step and plays a role in the half-life of the molecule. When an Fc sequence was fused to the C-terminus of FGF21, degradation was found to occur at the peptide bond between \n \namino acid residues\n \n 4 and 5 and between \n \namino acid residues\n \n 20 and 21. As a result of these experiments, it was determined that the Fc sequence appears to protect the portion of the FGF21 sequence that is adjacent to the Fc sequence from degradation. An analysis of the in vivo degradation of wild-type FGF21 and Fc-FGF21 fusion proteins was further conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. These studies confirmed that the cleavage site of FGF21 at amino acid residues 171-172 is the major site of degradation in monkeys and that this site of degradation is conserved between murine and primate.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nIdentification of FGF21 Proteolysis-Resistant Mutants\n\n\n \n \n \nSuitable FGF21 mutants were identified by experimentally determining the positions of the wild-type FGF21 sequence that are sites of major proteolytic activity, and specific amino acid substitutions were introduced at these sites. Amino acid substitutions were based on FGF21 sequence conservation with other species (as described in Example 8) and biochemical conservation with other amino acid residues. A list of amino acid substitutions that were or can be introduced into the wild-type FGF21 protein is provided in Table 8, although Table 8 is only exemplary and other substitutions can be made. The numbers of the positions given in Table 8 correspond to the residue position in the mature FGF21 protein, which consists of 181 amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFGF21 Residues Mutated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmino Acid\n\n\nNative\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition\n\n\nResidue\n\n\nMutations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nArg\n\n\nGln, Ile, \nLys\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nTyr\n\n\nHis, Leu, \nPhe\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\nLeu\n\n\nIle, Phe, Tyr, Val\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\nTyr\n\n\nIle, Phe, \nVal\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n150\n\n\nPro\n\n\nAla, Arg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n151\n\n\nGly\n\n\nAla, Val\n\n\n\n\n\n\n152\n\n\nIle\n\n\nHis, Leu, Phe, Val\n\n\n\n\n\n\n170\n\n\nGly\n\n\nAla, Asn, Asp, Cys, Gln, Glu, Pro, Ser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n171\n\n\nPro\n\n\nAla, Arg, Asn, Asp, Cys, Glu, Gln, Gly,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHis, Lys, Ser, Thr, Trp, Tyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n172\n\n\nSer\n\n\nLeu, Thr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n173\n\n\nGln\n\n\nArg, Glu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nIn Vivo Analysis of Fc-FGF21 and FGF21-Fc Degradation\n\n\n \n \n \nThe stability of FGF21 Fc fusion proteins in vivo was determined by injecting mice with a fusion protein, drawing blood from the mice at various time points, and analyzing the serum by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In particular, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 10 mg/kg of Fc(5)FGF21 (expressed in \nE. coli \nand purified as described in Example 2) or FGF21(3)Fc (expressed in mammalian cells and purified according to standard procedures). Blood was drawn from the mice at 6, 24, and 48 hours after injection (Table 9) and collected into EDTA tubes pretreated with protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche Diagnostics). Plasma was separated by centrifuging the samples at 12,000 g for 10 minutes. FGF21 proteins were affinity purified from blood using an anti-human-Fc agarose resin.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFGF21 Samples\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nProtein\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSample\n\n\nAdministered\n\n\nBlood Withdrawn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nD6\n\n\nFc-\nFGF21\n \n\n\n 6 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nD24\n\n\nFc-\nFGF21\n \n\n\n24 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nD48\n\n\nFc-\nFGF21\n \n\n\n48 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nE6\n\n\nFGF21-\nFc\n \n\n\n 6 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nE24\n\n\nFGF21-\nFc\n \n\n\n24 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nE48\n\n\nFGF21-\nFc\n \n\n\n48 hours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to analyzing the affinity purified samples by LC-MS, Fc-FGF21 and FGF21-Fc protein standards were analyzed as a reference.

Amplification products were digested with the restriction endonuclease DpnI, and then transformed into competent cells. The resulting clones were sequenced to confirm the absence of polymerase-generated errors. Fc-FGF21 and FGF21-Fc fusion proteins were generated as described herein, e.g., in Example 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFGF21 mutants were expressed by transforming competent BL21 (DE3) or BL21 Star (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, Calif.) cells with the construct encoding a particular mutant. Transformants were grown overnight with limited aeration in TB media supplemented with 40 μg/mL kanamycin, were aerated the next morning, and after a short recovery period, were induced in 0.4 mM IPTG. FGF21 mutant polypeptides were harvested by centrifugation 18-20 hours after induction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFGF21 mutants were also analyzed for predicted immunogenicity. Immune responses against proteins are enhanced by antigen processing and presentation in the major histocompatability complex (MHC) class II binding site. This interaction is required for T cell help in maturation of antibodies that recognize the protein. Since the binding sites of MHC class II molecules have been characterized, it is possible to predict whether proteins have specific sequences that can bind to a series of common human alleles. Computer algorithms have been created based on literature references and MHC class II crystal structures to determine whether linear amino acid peptide sequences have the potential to break immune tolerance. The TEPITOPE computer program was used to determine if point mutations in particular FGF21 mutants would increase antigen specific T cells in a majority of humans. Based on an analysis of the linear protein sequence of each FGF21 mutant, none of the mutants was predicted to enhance immunogenicity.\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nImpact of Linker Sequence on FGF21 Degradation\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine whether the presence of a longer amino acid linker between the Fc sequence and the FGF21 sequence affects FGF21 degradation, mice were injected with FGF21 fusion proteins in which the Fc region was separated from the FGF21 sequence by a 15 amino acid linker having the sequence GGGGGSGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO: 23), blood was withdrawn from the mice at various time points, and the serum was analyzed by LC-MS. In particular, mice were injected with Fc(15)FGF21 or FGF21(15)Fc (obtained from \nE. coli\n) at 23 mg/kg, blood was drawn at 6, 24, and 48 hours, and drawn blood was affinity purified using an anti-human-Fc agarose resin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to analyzing the purified samples by LC-MS, Fc(15)FGF21 and FGF21(15)Fc protein standards were analyzed as a reference. Protein standards were either reduced with TCEP or not reduced. Both reduced and non-reduced standards were analyzed by LC-MS using an \nACE cyano\n 0 3 mm×30 cm column with the column effluent spraying into an LCQ Classic ion-trap mass spectrometer. Since the deconvoluted spectra of the reduced samples were cleaner, the affinity purified samples were reduced prior to LC-MS analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe observed masses for the reduced Fc(15)FGF21 standard and corresponding affinity purified samples withdrawn at various time points are shown in \nFIGS. 8A-8D\n. The observed masses for the reduced FGF21(15)Fc standard and corresponding affinity purified samples withdrawn at various time points are shown in \nFIGS. 9A-9D\n. Some of the standard and sample eluates were subjected to Edman sequencing in order to confirm the N-terminus of the proteins and assist in predicting the identity of the fragments observed by LC-MS.

After 24 hours of circulation, the major products of Fc(15)FGF21 were fragments consisting of amino acid residues 1-414 (85% of sample) and 1-394 (15% of sample), and the major products of FGF21(15)Fc were fragments consisting of amino acid residues 1-423 (40% of sample), 6-423 (35% of sample), and 22-423 (25% of sample). Identified cleavage points for the Fc(15)FGF21 and FGF21(15)Fc proteins are shown in \nFIGS. 10A and 10B\n, respectively.\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nIn Vivo Activity of Proteolysis-Resistant Fc(15)FGF21 Mutants at 1-7 Days after Injection\n\n\n \n \n \nAs described herein, proteolytic cleavage of FGF21 Fc fusion proteins depends upon the orientation of the Fc sequence, with the Fc end of the fusion protein being more stable than the FGF21 end of the fusion protein (i.e., the N-terminal portion of Fc-FGF21 fusion proteins and the C-terminal portion of FGF21-Fc fusion proteins were found to be more stable). For example, cleavage was identified at \n \npositions\n \n 5 and 21 of FGF21-Fc and positions 151 and 171 of Fc-FGF21.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result of these observations, an investigation was performed to identify proteolysis-resistant FGF21 mutants. LC-MS analysis of Fc-FGF21 demonstrates that in vivo proteolytic degradation first occurs between amino acid residues 171-172, followed by degradation between amino acid residues 151-152. By blocking proteolytic degradation at position 171, the cleavage at position 151 can be prevented, effectively extending the half-life of the molecule. However, proteolysis-resistant mutants in which cleavage is prevented at position 151 can still possess residues at position 171 that are susceptible to protease attack, thereby resulting in a molecule missing the last 10 amino acids, which are known to be involved in the binding of the co-receptor beta-klotho, which is a determinant of ligand receptor affinity and in vitro and in vivo potency. Therefore, the mutagenesis of amino acid residues surrounding position 171 in mature FGF21 appear to be more critical for improving the in vivo stability, potency, and efficacy of the molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe in vivo activity of particular proteolysis-resistant Fc(15)FGF21 mutants was assayed by intraperitoneally injecting ob/ob mice with an FGF21 mutant, drawing blood samples from injected mice at 0, 0.25, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after injection, and then measuring blood glucose levels in the samples. The results of one experiment are provided in \nFIG. 11\n, which shows the blood glucose levels measured in mice injected with a PBS control, an Fc(15)FGF21 control, or the Fc(15)FGF21 mutants Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 P171A, Fc(15)FGF21 S172L, Fc(15)FGF21 G170E/P171A/S172L, or Fc(15)FGF21 G151A. \nFIG. 12\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels as determined in this experiment. This experiment demonstrates that the Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 P171A, Fc(15)FGF21 S172L, and Fc(15)FGF21 G170E/P171A/S172L mutants exhibit sustained blood glucose lowering activity for up to 5 days, which is superior to the activity of wild-type Fc-FGF21 The Fc(15)FGF21 G151A mutant only partially improved the duration of blood glucose lowering activity as compared with wild-type Fc-FGF21 fusion protein. Surprisingly, although the Fc(15)-FGF21 S172L mutant is not a proteolysis-resistant mutant, and therefore has similar degradation profile as the wild-type Fc(15)-FGF21 polypeptide, this mutant was found to exhibit improved in vivo efficacy as compared with the wild-type Fc(15)-FGF21 polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of another experiment are provided in \nFIG. 13\n, which shows the blood glucose levels measured in mice injected with a PBS control, an Fc(15)FGF21 control, or the Fc(15)FGF21 mutants Fc(15)FGF21 P150A/G151A/1152V, Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 G170E/P171A, or Fc(15)FGF21 G170E/S172L. \nFIG. 14\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels as determined in this experiment. As in the experiment described above, the wild-type Fc-FGF21 fusion protein and the Fc(15)FGF21 P150A/G151A/1152V mutant do not exhibit sustained blood glucose lowering activity, possibly because the degradation at 171 site could still occur, and blood glucose levels in animals injected with these proteins returned to baseline at 24 hours after injection. However, the Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 G170E/P171A, or Fc(15)FGF21 G170E/S172L exhibit maximal blood glucose lowering activity up to 5 days after injection, which is superior to the wild-type Fc-FGF21 fusion protein and the Fc(15)FGF21 P150A/G151A/1152V mutant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of another experiment are provided in \nFIG. 15\n, which shows the blood glucose levels measured in mice injected with a PBS control or the Fc(15)FGF21 mutants Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 G170A, Fc(15)FGF21 G170C, Fc(15)FGF21 G170D, Fc(15)FGF21 G170N, or Fc(15)FGF21 G1705. \nFIG. 16\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels as determined in this experiment. All of the FGF21 mutants tested in this experiment exhibited sustained blood glucose lowering activity for up to 5 days after injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of another experiment are provided in \nFIG. 17\n, which shows the blood glucose levels measured in mice injected with PBS or the Fc(15)FGF21 mutants Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 P171E, Fc(15)FGF21 P171H, Fc(15)FGF21 P171Q, Fc(15)FGF21 P171T, or Fc(15)FGF21 P171Y. \nFIG. 18\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels as determined in this experiment. All of the FGF21 mutants tested in this experiment exhibited improved blood glucose lowering activity when compared with wild-type Fc-FGF21.\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\nIn Vivo Degradation of Proteolysis-Resistant Fc(15)FGF21 Mutants at 6 to 120 Hours after Injection\n\n\n \n \n \nThe in vivo stability of selected FGF21 mutants was analyzed by injecting mice with an FGF21 mutant, drawing blood from the mice at various time points, and analyzing the serum by LC-MS. In particular, mice were injected with either the Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 P171A, or Fc(15)FGF21 S172L mutants (obtained from \nE. coli \nas described in Example 2), each of which were diluted in approximately 180 μL of 10 mM HCl prior to injection, and blood was drawn at 6, 24, 48, 72, and 120 hours. FGF21 proteins were affinity purified from the drawn blood using an anti-human-Fc agarose resin column. Samples were eluted from the column using 10 mM HCl. All of the FGF21 constructs comprise an Fc region and 15 amino acid linker at the amino-terminal end of the FGF21 protein. Mice were also injected with a wild-type FGF21 control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to analyzing the affinity purified samples by LC-MS, unprocessed wild-type FGF21 and unprocessed FGF21 mutants were analyzed as a reference. All standards and time point samples were reduced with TCEP, and then analyzed by LC-MS using an \nACE cyano\n 0 3 mm×30 cm column with the column effluent spraying into an LCQ Classic ion-trap mass spectrometer. Affinity purified samples were diluted with ammonium acetate, reduced with TCEP, and then analyzed by LC-MS as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe observed masses for wild-type Fc(15)FGF21 at 0, 6, 24, and 48 hours after injection are shown in \nFIGS. 19A-19D\n, respectively. The observed masses for Fc(15)FGF21 G170E at 0, 6, 24, and 48 hours after injection are shown in \nFIGS. 20A-20D\n, respectively. The observed masses for Fc(15)FGF21 P171A at 0, 6, 24, and 48 hours after injection are shown in \nFIGS. 21A-21D\n, respectively. The observed masses for Fc(15)FGF21 S172L at 0, 6, 24, and 48 hours after injection are shown in \nFIGS. 22A-22D\n, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll of the samples drawn at 72 and 120 hours were found to contain a high molecular weight (>200 kDa by non-reducing SDS-PAGE) component of fibrinogen that is much more abundant than the remaining Fc(15)FGF21 fusion protein.

The degradation products of the Fc(15)FGF21 G170E and Fc(15)FGF21 P171A mutants also look similar in that the samples drawn after 24 hours of circulation contain 70-80% intact protein (amino acids 1-424) and 20-30% of a fragment consisting of amino acid residues 1-421. Even after 48 hours, the Fc(15)FGF21 G170E and Fc(15)FGF21 P171A mutants still retain intact protein while showing an increase in the amount of the fragment consisting of amino acid residues 1-421. As observed in prior analyses of Fc-FGF21 constructs, degradation of the FGF21 portion of the fusion protein was detected and the Fc portion was found to remain stable. The cleavage sites identified for wild-type, Fc(15)FGF21 G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 P171A, and Fc(15)FGF21 S172L are shown in \nFIGS. 23A-23D\n, respectively.\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\nIdentification of Aggregation-Reducing FGF21 Mutants\n\n\n \n \n \nOne property of wild-type FGF21 is its propensity to aggregate. Aggregation-reducing FGF21 mutants were identified on the basis of two hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that, with respect to FGF21, aggregation (or dimerization) is triggered by hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals interactions between FGF21 molecules caused by hydrophobic residues that are exposed to hydrophilic water-based solvent environment. The second hypothesis is that these exposed hydrophobic residues can be substituted to create aggregation-reducing point-mutation variants without compromising FGF21 activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA systematic rational protein engineering approach was used to identify exposed hydrophobic residues in FGF21. As there were no known X-ray or NMR structures of FGF21 that could be used to identify exposed hydrophobic residues, a high resolution (1.3 Å) X-ray crystal structure of FGF19 (1PWA) obtained from the Protein Databank (PDB) was used to create a 3D homology model of FGF21 using MOE (Molecular Operating Environment; Chemical Computing Group; Montreal, Quebec, Canada) modeling software. FGF19 was chosen as a template, since among the proteins deposited in the PDB, FGF19 is the most closely related protein to FGF21 in terms of the amino acid sequence homology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolvent accessibility was calculated by the following method using MOE. A first measure of surface area (SA1) is defined as the area of the residue's accessible surface in Å\n2\n. While a particular amino acid residue appears in a protein's primary sequence multiple times, each occurrence of the residue can have a different surface area due to differences in, inter alia, the residue's proximity to the protein surface, the orientation of the residue's side-chain, and the spatial position of adjacent amino acid residues. Therefore, a second measure of surface area (SA2) is made wherein the residue of interest is extracted from the protein structure along with that residue's neighboring, or adjacent, residues. These spatially adjacent residues are mutated in silico to glycines to remove their side-chains, and then the SA2 for the residue of interest is calculated, giving a measure of the total possible surface area for that residue in its particular conformation. A ratio of SA1 to SA2 (SA1/SA2) can then give a measure of the percentage of the possible surface area for that residue that is actually exposed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral hydrophobic residues that are highly exposed to the solvent were selected for further analysis, and in silico point mutations were made to these residues to replace the selected residue with the other naturally occurring amino acid residues. The changes in protein thermal stability resulting from different substitutions were calculated using the FGF21 model and the interactive web-based program CUPSAT (Cologne University Protein Stability Analysis Tools) according to instructions provided at the CUPSAT website. See Parthiban et al., 2006, \nNucleic Acids Res. \n34: W239-42; Parthiban et al., 2007, \nBMC Struct. Biol. \n7:54.

Samples to be analyzed were incubated at 4° C., room temperature, or 37° C. for various time points, and then subjected to SEC analysis. Experiments were performed on a Beckman HPLC system equipped with a SEC column. For wild-type FGF21, a TOSOHAAS TSK-Gel G2000 SEC column was used with 2×PBS containing 2% isopropyl alcohol as the mobile phase.

In addition, FGF21 stability can be further enhanced by fusing such modified FGF21 proteins with the Fc portion of the human immunoglobulin IgG1 gene. Moreover, by introducing combinations of the above modifications, FGF21 molecules having both enhanced stability and solubility can be generated. Nucleic acid sequences encoding the FGF21 combination mutants listed in Table 18 were prepared using the techniques described above.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFGF21 Combination Mutants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmino Acid\n\n\nProteolysis\n\n\nAggregation\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidues\n\n\nMutation\n\n\nMutation\n\n\nFc\n\n\nLinker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nG170E\n\n\nA45K\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nG170E\n\n\nL98R\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nG170E\n\n\nA45K, L98R\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nP171G\n\n\nA45K\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nP171S\n\n\nA45K\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nP171G\n\n\nL98R\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nP171S\n\n\nL98R\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-181\n\n\nP171G\n\n\nA45K, L98R\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-178\n\n\nG170E\n\n\n \n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-181\n\n\nG170E\n\n\n \n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-181\n\n\nG170E\n\n\nA45K\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-181\n\n\nG170E\n\n\nL98R\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-181\n\n\nP171G\n\n\n \n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-181\n\n\nP171G\n\n\nL98R\n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7-181\n\n\nG170E\n\n\n \n\n\n—\nNH\n \n \n \n2\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 29\n shows the blood glucose levels measured in mice injected with the Fc(15)FGF21 combination mutants Fc(15)FGF21 A45K/G170E, Fc(15)FGF21 A45K/P171G, or Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another experiment the FGF21 mutant Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G was studied side-by-side with wild-type mature FGF21 and Fc-FGF21. In one experiment, a recombinant 293T cell line was cultured in the presence of different concentrations of FGF21, Fc-FGF21, or Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G for 6 hours. Cell lysates were then assayed for luciferase activity. As shown in \nFIG. 30\n, Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G had similar activity to Fc-FGF21, indicating that the introduction of the two point mutations didn't alter the molecule's in vitro activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another experiment, the stability of the Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G at 65 mg/mL was evaluated for nine days at two different temperatures, namely room temperature and 4° C., side-by-side with FGF21 and Fc-FGF21. After the incubation period cell lysates were then analyzed with SEC-HPLC to determine an aggregation versus time profile at various temperatures. The data shown in \nFIGS. 31A and 31B\n indicate that the rate of aggregation formation was significantly reduced in the Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G at room temperature (solid triangles, dotted line in \nFIG. 31A\n) and at 4° C. (solid triangles, dotted line in \nFIG. 31B\n).\n\n\n \nExample 21\n\n\nProteolysis-Resistant FGF21 Mutants Comprising C-Terminal Mutations\n\n\n \n \n \nThe in vivo stability of combination mutants was also studied. Specifically, the in vivo stability of Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G was compared with the stability of Fc(15)FGF21 in murine and cynomolgus models. The results were found to be similar in both species. In the cynomolgus study, Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G and Fc(15)FGF21 were injected IV at 23.5 mg/kg and aliquots of serum and plasma were collected at time points out to 840 hours post dose. Time points out to 168 hours were analyzed. Time point samples were affinity-purified using anti-Fc reagents, then analyzed using MALDI mass spectrometry. The results correlated well between the two analyses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalyzing data generated using immunoaffinity-MALDI, clipping at the P171 site was seen to be eliminated in the Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G molecule as a result of the mutation of P171 to P171G. However, a minor and slow degradation resulting in a loss of up to 3 C-terminal residues was observed for Fc(15)FGF21 L98R/P171G (\nFIG. 32\n). The minor cleavages at the three C-terminal residues were also observed with other FGF21 mutants after the more susceptible cleavage site between amino acid residues 171 and 172 was blocked as shown in \nFIGS. 20 and 21\n. The 3 C-terminal residue cleavage may represent the cessation of cleavage from the C-terminal end of the molecule by a carboxypeptidase in a sequential, residue-by-residue fashion or a specific protease attack at amino acid residues 178 and 179 with non-specific clipping at amino acid residues 179-180 and 180-181. The loss of 2-3 amino acids at the C-terminus could cause reduced beta-klotho binding and ultimately decreased potency and in vivo activity of the molecule See, e.g., Yie et al., 2009, \nFEBS Lett. \n583:19-24. To address the apparent carboxypeptidase degradation of the C-terminus, the impact of adding an amino acid residue “cap” to various FGF21 mutant polypeptides were studied. A variety of constructs, including those presented in Table 19, were made and assayed using the techniques described herein. Table 19 summarizes the results of the in vitro ELK luciferase assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable amino acid caps can be between 1 and 15 amino acids in length, for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or 15 amino acids in length. Any number and type of amino acid(s) can be employed as a cap, for example, a single proline residue, and single glycine residue, two glycine residues, five glycine residues, as well as other combinations. Additional examples of caps are provided in the instant Example and in Table 19.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, to address the apparent protease attack at amino acid residues 178 and 179, mutation of amino acid residues at \npositions\n 179, 180 and 181 was studied. Again, a variety of constructs, including those presented in Table 19, were made and assayed using the techniques described herein. The impact of combinations of cap and mutations at these sites was also explored. Table 19 summarizes exemplary constructs that were made and studied in the in vitro ELK-luciferase assay, which was performed as described herein. Consistent with the terminology used herein, hFc means a human Fc sequence (i.e., SEQ ID NO:13), L15 refers to a linker having 15 residues (i.e., SEQ ID NO:23)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficacy and EC50 Values for FGF21 Polypeptides\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComprising C-terminal Modifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructs\n\n\nEfficacy\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhuFGF21\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n100.0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G)\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n76.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, Y179F)\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n78.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, 1-180)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, 1-179)\n\n\n7.8\n\n\n77.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, A180E)\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n79.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, S181K)\n\n\n130\n\n\n87.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGSGSGSGSGS.hFGF21.L15.hFc\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMKEDD.hFGF21.L15.hFc\n\n\n834\n\n\n83.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, S181P, P182)\n\n\n272\n\n\n69.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, A180G)\n\n\n3.25\n\n\n76.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, S181G)\n\n\n3.43\n\n\n77.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, L182)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFGF21(L98R, P171G, G182)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, Y179P)\n\n\n428\n\n\n44.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, Y179G)\n\n\n61\n\n\n82.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, Y179S)\n\n\n25.3\n\n\n74.8%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, Y179A)\n\n\n43.2\n\n\n79.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, S181T)\n\n\n3.07\n\n\n77.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, S181A)\n\n\n2.66\n\n\n73.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, S181L)\n\n\n3.46\n\n\n72.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, S181P)\n\n\n33.8\n\n\n79.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, A180P)\n\n\n617\n\n\n77.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, A180S)\n\n\n2.18\n\n\n84.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFGF21(L98R, P171G, GGGGG182-6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, P182)\n\n\n6.1\n\n\n85.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, G182)\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n71.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(1-178, L98R, P171G)\n\n\n167\n\n\n63.9%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, GG182-3)\n\n\n1941\n\n\n84.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhFc.L15.hFGF21(L98R, P171G, GGGGG182-6)\n\n\n4307\n\n\n99.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 33\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels observed in diabetic db/db mice (C57B6 background) injected with a PBS control, wild type native FGF21, Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G) and two capped molecules to which either a proline or glycine residue was added at the C-terminal end, i.e. Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182P) and Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182G). In the instant Example, when a residue was added to the C-terminus of a wild-type or mutant FGF21 polypeptide, the residue is referred to by its position in the resultant protein. Thus, “182G” indicates that a glycine residue was added to the C-terminus of the mature 181 residue wild-type or mutant protein. \nFIG. 33\n shows that native FGF21 lowered blood glucose levels for 6 hours while all three Fc(15)FGF21 mutants studied showed sustained blood glucose-lowering activity for at least 120 hours. Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182P), molecule comprising the addition of a proline residue at the C-terminus of the FGF21 component of the fusion molecule, appeared most potent and resulted in lowest blood glucose levels compared with Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G) and Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182 G).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a subsequent experiment, the in vivo activity of (L98R, P171G, 182G) and Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182P) was studied and compared to the in vivo activity of a capped molecule comprising a two glycine addition at the C-terminus, namely Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182G183G). \nFIG. 34\n shows the results of that experiment. \nFIG. 34\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels observed in ob/ob mice injected with PBS control, Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G), Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182G183G), Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182G) and Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182P).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 34\n, all of the molecules studied showed sustained glucose-lowering activity compared with the PBS control. This experiment confirmed the previous results (\nFIG. 33\n) that Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182P) with a proline addition at the C-terminus showed slightly enhanced glucose-lowering efficacy compared with the molecule without a proline cap, e.g. Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G). However, the addition of two glycine residues at the C-terminus, e.g. Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, 182G183G), appeared to reduce the molecule's in vivo potency and shortened the duration of in vivo glucose-lowering effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 35\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels observed in diabetic db/db mice (C57B6 background) injected with PBS control or the FGF21 mutant polypeptides Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G), Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, Y179S), Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, Y179A), Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, A1805), and Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, A180G). All mutants showed similar glucose-lowering activity with similar duration of action.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 36\n shows the percent change in blood glucose levels observed in diabetic db/db mice (C57B6 background) injected with vehicle control, Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G), Fc-FGF21 (L98R, P171G, Y179F), and Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, A180E). Compared with Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G), Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, Y179F) was less efficacious in lowering blood glucose. However, Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G, A180E), in which alanine at amino acid position of 180 was mutated to glutamic acid, was more efficacious than Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G) and caused additional 20% reduction of blood glucose levels compared with Fc(15)FGF21 (L98R, P171G). These data suggest that A180E mutation may have reduced the C-terminal degradation in vivo and thereby improved in vivo potency and efficacy of the molecule.\n\n\n \nExample 22\n\n\n \nRhesus \nMonkey Study\n\n\n \n \n \nAn Fc-Linker-FGF21 construct was generated using methodology described herein. The construct comprised an IgG1 Fc sequence (SEQ ID NO:13) fused at the C-terminus to a (Gly)\n5\n-Ser-(Gly)\n3\n-Ser-(Gly)\n4\n-Ser linker sequence (SEQ ID NO:23) which was then fused at the C-terminus to the N terminus of a mature FGF21 sequence (SEQ ID NO:4), into which two mutations, L98R and P171G, had been introduced. This construct was then expressed and purified as described herein, and was isolated as a dimeric form of the protein, each monomer of which was linked via intermolecular disulfide bonds between the Fc region of each monomer. This molecule is referred to in the instant Example as “Fc-FGF21(RG)” and has the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 38 and is encoded by SEQ ID NO:37. In this Example, FGF21 refers to the mature form of FGF21, namely SEQ ID NO:4.\n\n\n \n22.1 Study Design\n\n\n \n \n \nThe Fc-FGF21(RG) construct was administered chronically and subcutaneously (“SC”) into non-diabetic male \nRhesus \nmonkeys with a BMI >35. Two other groups of monkeys (n=10 per group) were treated with either mature FGF21 (i.e., SEQ ID NO:4) or a vehicle control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimals were acclimated for 42 days prior to administration of any test compound and were then divided into groups of 10 and administered multiple SC injections of test compounds or control article in a blinded fashion, as depicted graphically in \nFIG. 37\n. In brief, each animal was injected once a day with compound or vehicle. FGF21 was administered daily, whereas Fc-FGF21(RG) was administered weekly. Fc-FGF21(RG) and FGF21 doses were escalated every 2 weeks, as shown in \nFIG. 37\n. Body weight and food intake were monitored throughout the study. The CRO was blinded to the treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed prior to the start of the treatment. OGTT1 was used to sort the animals into three equivalent groups having a similar distribution of animals based on area under the curve (AUC) and body weight. The results of the second OGTT (OGTT2) was used to confirm the sorting of the first OGTT (OGTT1). Monkeys with OGTT profiles that were inconsistent from one test (OGTT1) to the next (OGTT2) were excluded. The results of \n \nOGTTs\n \n 1 and 2 are shown in \nFIGS. 38A and 38B\n, with AUC measurements shown in \nFIG. 38C\n. Baseline body weight is shown in \nFIG. 38D\n and Table 20.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOGTTs\n \n \n 3, 4, and 5 were performed every 2 weeks at the end of each dose treatment of low, mid and high doses.

Blood samples were also collected weekly during the 3-week washout period.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBaseline OGTT1 and OGTT2 showed an expected glucose profile as seen in normal animals, with a maximum plasma glucose obtained at 30 minutes, and demonstrated stable AUCs for the 3 different groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFasting baselines values for plasma chemistry are shown in Table 20.

Dose levels were chosen based on the observed dose-response in mice, with a dosing regimen based on the anticipated frequency of injection in humans. Equimolar doses of FGF21 were used for the low and mid doses, and the Fc-FGF21(RG) high dose was raised to 5 mg/kg (i.e., instead of 3 mg/kg, which would have been equimolar to the 1 mg/kg FGF21 dose).\n\n\n \n22.2 Effect of Test Compounds on Body Weight\n\n\n \n \n \nIn this experiment, in order to measure effect of the test compounds on body weight measured weekly, the percent body weight change from baseline was calculated weekly in the three different groups of \nRhesus \nmonkeys. Body weight was also measured during the three week of wash out period. Baseline body weight values for each group are included in Table 20.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBody weight was followed throughout the study, both pre- and post-administration of test compounds. Body weight percent change from baseline of the vehicle animals increased with time, whereas body weight of animals treated with Fc-FGF21(RG) and FGF21 decreased in a dose-dependent fashion over the course of the 6 week treatment period, as shown in \nFIG. 39\n. As observed previously in rodents (Xu et al., \nDiabetes \n58(1):250-9 (2009)), treatment with FGF21 statistically significantly decreased body weight. Fc-FGF21(RG) had a greater exposure than did FGF21 (\nFIG. 48\n and \nFIG. 47\n, respectively), offering a possible explanation for the observation that Fc-FGF21(RG) showed a more pronounced body weight decrease than FGF21.\n\n\n \n22.3. Effect of Test Compounds on Insulin Levels\n\n\n \n \n \nInsulin levels were measured in blood samples that had been collected after an overnight fast or after an afternoon meal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFasting plasma insulin levels were measured in \nRhesus \nmonkeys every week in animals treated with either vehicle, FGF21 or Fc-FGF21(RG) and during the 3-week washout period. Fasted blood samples were drawn approximately five days after the last Fc-FGF21(RG) injection and approximately 21 hours after the last FGF21 injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFed plasma insulin levels were measured in \nRhesus \nmonkeys during the fifth and sixth week of treatment with either vehicle or FGF21 during the high dose treatment. Fed blood samples were drawn approximately three days after Fc-FGF21(RG) injection and approximately 2 hours after last FGF21 injection. \nFIG. 40\n shows the effect of vehicle, FGF21 and Fc-FGF21(RG) on fasted insulin levels over the full nine week study, while \nFIG. 41\n depicts fed insulin levels determined from samples taken during \n \nweeks\n \n 5 and 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSummarily, at the two highest doses, both FGF21 and Fc-FGF21(RG) statistically significantly decreased fasted and fed plasma insulin levels. The observation that insulin levels of animals treated with FGF21 and Fc-FGF21(RG) were decreased without observing increased glucose levels is indicative of increased insulin sensitivity.\n\n\n \n22.4 Effect of Test Compounds on OGTT (Glucose and Insulin)\n\n\n \n \n \nThree OGTTs (\n \nOGTTs\n \n 3, 4 and 5) were performed after treatment was initiated. OGTT5 glucose and insulin level profiles were measured in animals treated for 6 weeks with vehicle, FGF21 or Fc-FGF21(RG), corresponding to the last two weeks of the high dose escalation regimen. OGTT5 was conducted approximately 7 days after the last Fc-FGF21(RG) injection, and approximately 21 hours after the last FGF21 injection. The OGTT5 glucose and insulin profiles are shown in \nFIG. 42\n and \nFIG. 43\n, respectively. Animals treated with Fc-FGF21(RG) showed an improved glucose clearance compared to vehicle-treated animals only at the highest dose and at the last time point measured, as shown in \nFIG. 42\n. At the end of the last dose, Fc-FGF21(RG) showed the strongest improvement in glucose clearance. FGF21 showed no improvement in glucose clearance. Fc-FGF21(RG) had a greater exposure than did FGF21 (\nFIG. 48\n and \nFIG. 47\n, respectively), offering a possible explanation for the observation that Fc-FGF21(RG) showed a more pronounced effect in glucose clearance than FGF21. Insulin levels during OGTT5 were statistically significantly lowered at the last time point measured in animals treated with Fc-FGF21(RG) compared to animals treated with vehicle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucose AUC percent change from baseline was calculated for the three OGTT (\n \nOGTTs\n \n 3, 4 and 5) performed at the end of each of the low, mid and high doses in the three groups different groups of \nRhesus \nmonkeys as shown in \nFIG. 44\n. OGTT5 was conducted approximately seven days after the last Fc-FGF21(RG) injection and 21 hours after last FGF21 injection and showed that Fc-FGF21(RG) statistically significantly reduced AUC5. Baseline OGTT values for each group are shown on \nFIG. 38C\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFasted plasma glucose levels were measured on days when no OGTTs were performed. There were no meaningful statistical differences observed in fasted plasma glucose levels measured among the three groups of animals.\n\n\n \n22.5 Effect of Test Compounds on Triglyceride Levels\n\n\n \n \n \nPercent change of fasting plasma triglyceride levels was calculated in \nRhesus \nmonkeys every week in animals treated with either vehicle, FGF21 or Fc-FGF21(RG) and during the 3-week washout period. Fasted blood samples were drawn approximately five days after last Fc-FGF21(RG) injection and approximately 21 hours after last FGF21 injection. Triglyceride levels were measured every week after the treatment was initiated and percent changes from baseline are shown in \nFIG. 45\n, fasting baseline values are shown in Table 20.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs depicted in \nFIG. 45\n, animals treated with either Fc-FGF21(RG) or FGF21 showed a dose-dependent decrease in triglyceride levels, with Fc-FGF21(RG) having the greatest lowering effect compared to FGF21.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 46\n shows the plasma triglyceride levels in samples acquire from \nRhesus \nmonkeys in a fed state, during the fifth and sixth week of treatment with vehicle or Fc-FGF21(RG) or FGF21. Fed blood samples were drawn approximately 3 days after Fc-FGF21(RG) injection and approximately 2 hours after last FGF21 injection. Fed plasma triglyceride levels of animals treated with FGF21 and Fc-FGF21(RG) were statistically significantly reduced, compared to the triglyceride levels of animals treated with vehicle (\nFIG. 46\n).\n\n\n \n22.6 Concentration of Test Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nThe exposure of the tested compounds administered at approximately equivalent molar dose levels was assessed throughout the study period. The concentration of Fc-FGF21(RG) was measured at pre-dose, and approximately 5 days after the last injection. FGF21 levels were measured at pre-dose, and at 5, 12, 19, and 26 days. Blood samples were drawn at approximately 21 hours after the last injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe individual concentration of the tested compounds in each monkeys are shown in \nFIGS. 47 and 48\n. As shown in \nFIG. 47\n, the majority of the animals in the FGF21-treated group had concentrations below the quantitation limit. \nFIG. 48\n shows that animals in the Fc-FGF21(RG)-treated group had detectable levels of Fc-FGF21(RG) during each dosing phase (two weekly doses at the same dose strength). The average concentration from each dosing phase increased approximately dose-proportionally from 0.3 to 5 mg/kg for Fc-FGF21(RG). There is minimal accumulation as demonstrated by the steady concentrations after the first and second weekly dose within each dose escalation phase for both compounds. During the treatment-free phase (washout period) Fc-FGF21(RG) levels were detectable up to approximately day 47 (12 days post last dose) and were below lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) afterwards.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExposure of the test compounds was also monitored during each OGTT. FGF21 was not detectable during \n \nOGTTs\n \n 3 and 4, following low- and mid-dose FGF21 treatment. However, measurable levels were observed during OGTT5, following high-dose treatment. A dose proportional increase in Fc-FGF21(RG) levels was observed across the third to fifth OGTT with escalating dose levels, as shown in \nFIG. 49\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound levels data confirm that the animals were exposed to the expected amount of each compound, namely FGF21 and Fc-FGF21(RG), in a dose escalation manner. A large variability was observed in the amount of FGF21 measured, which was an expected result considering the sampling was performed approximately 21 hours post the last dose and the half life of FGF21 is approximately 1 hour.\n\n\n \n22.7 Conclusions\n\n\n \n \n \nFGF21 decreased fasted and fed plasma triglyceride and insulin levels and decreased body weight at the highest doses. Fc-FGF21(RG) improved OGTT and decreased insulin levels at the highest dose, and dose dependently decreased fasted and fed plasma triglyceride levels as well as body weight. Both FGF21 and Fc-FGF21(RG) decreased a number of metabolic parameters in the non diabetic \nRhesus \nmonkeys. Insulin and triglyceride level decreases were identical between FGF21 and Fc-FGF21(RG) when circulating compound levels were in a similar range, in the fed condition. Due to its improved properties, Fc-FGF21(RG) was superior to FGF21 in most of the parameters measured and could be administered once-a-week to observe efficacy on metabolic parameters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the present invention has been described in terms of various embodiments, it is understood that variations and modifications will occur to those skilled in the art.
