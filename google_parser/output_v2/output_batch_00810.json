Description\n\n\n\n\n Continuous Administration of lntegrin Ligands for Treating Cancer\n\n\nTechnical Field of the Invention: The invention relates to a specific therapy form for the treatment of cancer, especially tumors (or tumours) and tumor metastases, comprising administration of integrin ligands together with cancer cotherapeutic agents or other cancer cotherapeutic therapy forms that have additive or synergistic efficacy when administered together with said integrin ligand, such as chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapeutics, including antibodies, radioimmunoconjugates and immunocytokines and/or radiation therapy. More specifically, the instant invention relates to the use of at least one specific integrin ligand for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of cancer, wherein the medicament is administered to a patient in a manner to achieve an about zero order kinetic in said patient over at least 24 consecutive hours, and wherein the medicament is to be used in combination with a) one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, and/or b) one or more further chemotherapeutic agents other than the at least one specific integrin ligand and the one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. Additionally, the instant invention relates to methods of treatment, using said medicament. The therapy will preferably result in a synergistic potential increase of the inhibition effect of each individual therapeutic on tumor cell and tumor endothelial cell proliferation, preferably yielding a more effective treatment than found by administering an individual component alone, together or in another therapy regime but the regime of the present invention.\n\n\nBackground of the Invention: Vascular endothelial cells are known to contain at least three RGD- dependent integrins, including the vitronectin receptors Ovβ3 or ovβs as well as the collagen types I and IV receptors Ovβi and α\n2\nβi, the laminin receptors\n\n\nCONFIRMATION COPY \n\n α\n6\nβi and α\n3\nβi, and the fibronectin receptor α\n5\nβi (Davis et al., 1993, J. Cell. Biochem. 51 , 206). The smooth muscle cell is known to contain at least six RGD-dependent integrins, including α\nv\nβ\n3\n and α\nv\nβ\n5\n. Inhibition of cell adhesion in vitro using monoclonal antibodies immunospecific for various integrin α or β subunits have implicated the vitronectin receptor α\nv\nβ\n3\n in cell adhesion processes of a variety of cell types including microvascular endothelial cells (Davis etal., 1993, J. Cell. Biol. 51, 206). υ Integrins are a class of cellular receptors known to bind extracellular matrix proteins, and mediate cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions, referred generally to as cell adhesion events. The integrin receptors constitute a family of proteins with shared structural characteristics of non- covalenty associated heterodimeric glycoprotein complexes formed of α and5 β subunits. The vitronectin receptor, named for its original characteristic of preferential binding to vitronectin, is now known to refer to four different integrins, designated α\nv\nβi, α\nv\nβ\n3>\n α\nv\nβ\n5\n and α\nv\nβ\n8\n- α\nv\nβi binds fibronectin and vitronectin. α\nv\nβ\n3\n binds a large variety of ligands, including fibrin, fibrinogen, laminin, thrombospondin, vitronectin and von Willebrand's factor. α\nv\nβs0 binds vitronectin. It is clear that there are different integrins with different biological functions as well as different integrins and subunits having shared biological specificity and function. One important recognition site in a ligand for many integrins is the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide sequence. RGD is found in all of the ligands identified above for the vitronectin receptor integrins. The molecular basis of RGD recognition by α\nv\nβ\n3\n has been identified (Xiong et al., 2001) This RGD recognition site can be mimicked by linear and cyclic (poly)peptides that contain the RGD sequence. Such RGD peptides are known to be inhibitors or antagonists, respectively, of integrin function. It is important to note, however, that depending upon the sequence and structure of the RGD peptide, the specificity of the inhibition can be altered to target specific integrins. Various RGD polypeptides of varying integrin specificity have been described, for example, by Cheresh, et al., 1989, Cell \n\n 58, 945, Aumailley et al., 1991 , FEBS Letts. 291 , 50, and in numerous patent applications and patents (e.g. US patents 4,517,686, 4,578,079, 4,589,881 , 4,614,517, 4,661 ,111 , 4,792,525; EP 0770 622). The generation of new blood vessels, or angiogenesis, plays a key role in the growth of malignant disease and this has generated much interest in developing agents that inhibit angiogenesis.\n\n\nNevertheless, although various combination therapies utilizing potential angiogenesis inhibitors are under investigation, in clinical trials and on the market, the outcome of these therapies are not fruitful enough. Therefore, there still exists a need in the art to develop further combinations which can show increased efficacy and reduced side-effects. It is known today that tumor vasculature is different from vasculature of healthy tissue. The vasculature is characteristic for the tumor and distinct from the stable, dormant vasculature of healthy tissue. It is often characterized by an increased expression and priming of specific cell adhesion molecules of the alpha-v-integrin series, especially α\nv\nβ\n3\n and α\nv\nβ\n5\n. When activated these integrins enhance the cellular response to growth factors that drive angiogenesis, for example VEGFA and FGF2: VEGFA was originally termed vascular permeability factor, and it acts via the SRC kinase pathway to increase local vascular permeability. VEGRF2, when activated, increases the activity of α\nv\nβ\n3\n integrin.\n\n\nFurther, solid tumors depend on an induced and cooped vasculature from the host to develop. This vasculature has unusual molecular properties that distinguish it from the normal host vasculature: it tends to be activated, i.e. progressing through cell cycle under the influence of tumor-derived factors like VEGFs, FGFs and others, and expresses endothelial activation markers like ICAM, VCAM and alpha-v-series Integrins, e.g. α\nv\nβ\n3\n and α\nv\nβs, in a ligand competent state. It has a defective extracellular matrix, and is classically described as leaky. It is notable that tumors often resist therapies systemically applied via the blood stream, due to abnormal nature of tumor vasculature. \n\n The metastatic process is a multistep event and represents the most dreadful aspect of cancer. At the moment of diagnosis, cancers are frequently far advanced in their natural history, and the presence of metastases is a common event. In fact, approximately 30% of patients have detectable metastases at the moment of clinical diagnosis and a further 30% of patients have occult metastases. Metastases can be disseminated and they can infest different organs at the same time, or localize to a specific organ. In the case of localized disease, surgery is the treatment of choice; however recurrence and prognosis depend on many criteria such as: resectability, patient's clinical situation, and number of metastases.\n\n\nAfter resection, recurrence is common, suggesting that micrometastatic foci are present at the moment of diagnosis. Systemic chemotherapy is an ideal setting but only few patients are cured by it, and in the majority systemic chemotherapy fails. Many physiological barriers and pharmacokinetic parameters contribute to decrease its efficacy.\n\n\nLiver, lungs and lymph nodes are fUtration organs and therefore inclined to metastasization. The poor chemosensitivity of metastases, peculiarly those of colorectal origin has forced many researchers to use methods for increasing the time and the concentration of drugs. The need for decreasing or limiting the side effects for this important and delicate organ led to the development of the technique of liver isolation for perfusion of antineoplastic agents. (K. R. Aigner, Isolated liver perfusion. In: Morris DL, McArdle CS, Onik GM, eds. Hepatic Metastases. Oxford: Butterworth Heinemann, 1996. 101-107). Since 1981 , modifications and technical improvements have been continuously introduced. Liver metastases may be of different origin and their chemosensitivity may vary according to the histological type and their response in presence of heat. There still exists a growing need in the art in order to develop new therapeutic strategies for treating cancer, especially metastases systemically. The object of the present invention therefore was to develop such a new strategy. It should be applicable to systemic treatment, and it should lower the dose and/or increase the efficiency of the cancer therapeutical agents to \n\n be applied. A further object was to normalize tumor vasculature to increase delivery of systemic therapeutics of tumor, i.e. to reset the tumor vasculature to the functionality of the vasculature of non-tumor tissue.\n\n\nThus, it is a preferred objective of the instant invention to provide a more effective, better tolerated treatment for cancer patients leading to enhanced progression-free survival (PFS), QOL and increased median survival.\n\n\nBrief description of drawings:\n\n\nFig. 1 shows the results from the rat orthotopic glioblastoma model radiotherapy, cilengitide scheduling experiments.

Advantagously, this can be done according to the regimens as described herein.\n\n\nThus, subject of the instant invention is the use of at least one specific integrin ligand for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of cancer, wherein the medicament is to be used in combination with a) one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, and/or b) one or more further chemotherapeutic agents other than the at least one specific integrin ligand and the one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, and methods of treating cancer using said medicament. Preferably, it can be shown that the tumor vasculature can be functionally normalized by systemically applied integrin ligands as defined herein. Such inhibitors of integrin functions, also referred to as integrin ligands in the context of the present invention, increase the amount of cytotoxics and cytostatics, such as chemotherapeutic agents and/or cancer cotherapeutic agents as described herein, entering the tumor. In addition, the specific integrin ligand can be shown to enhance the numbers of leukocytes entering the tumor following systemic immunocytokines therapy, and may directly or indirectly increase the amounts of antibodies entering the tumor compartment on anti-tumor antibody therapy, or increase access to anti-tumor vaccines. Furthermore, it is believed that this functional normalization of the tumor vasculature will lead to changes in the metabolism of the tumor, e.g. a higher oxygen concentration in the tumor, and thus allows oxygen dependent therapies, like external beam radiotherapy, to become more effective. \n\n The \"functional normalizing agent\" of the present invention is defined here empirically as a reagent targeting alpha-v-integrins within the tumor compartment that increases the levels of systemic tumor therapeutics or of specific bio-indicators of a systemic therapy within the tumor. The increased local therapeutic overcomes tumor resistance mechanisms, and enhances therapeutic index. For example, the systemic therapeutic might be a classical chemotherapeutic reagent, an immunocytokines, a immunotoxin, or a radioimmunotherapy etc. etc. In one embodiment the present invention relates to a composition comprising as the cotherapeutic agent therapeutically active compounds, preferably selected from the group consisting of cytotoxic agents, chemotherapeutic agents and immunotoxic agents, and as the case may be other pharmacologically active compounds which may enhance the efficacy of said agents or reduce the side effects of said agents.\n\n\nThus, in this or further embodiments, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising an integrin ligand, preferably any of the a\nv\nβ\n3\n, a\nv\nβ\n5\n, a\nv\nββ or a\nv\nββ integrin receptor ligands, more preferably an RGD- containing linear or cyclic peptide, even more preferably RGD-containing integrin inhibitors, most preferably the cyclic peptide cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp- DPhe-NMe-Val), as well as the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof. According to the present invention therapeutically active compositions may also be provided by means of a pharmaceutical kit comprising a package comprising one or more of the said integrin ligands, and one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents, preferably as described herein, e.g. cytotoxic and/or chemotherapeutic and/or immunotoxic agents, in single packages or in separate containers. The therapy with these combinations may include optionally further treatment with radiation. The invention relates furthermore to a new therapy form comprising the start of the administration of an integrin ligand prior to radiotherapy.\n\n\nIn this new therapy form comprising the start of the administration of an integrin ligand prior to radiotherapy, it is a preferred feature that the integrin ligand is administered prior and/or during the to administration of the further \n\n cancer cotherapeutic agent, preferably at least during a significant part of the treatment regimen. In this context, according to the present invention, radiation, or, radiotherapy preferably has to be understood as a cancer cotherapeutic agent.\n\n\nIf the treament also comprises a non-continuous administration of an integrin ligand, more preferably the specific integrin ligand as defined herein the prior application of said integrin ligand takes place 1 to 8 hours (h), preferably 1 to 5 h, and more preferably 1 to 3 h before the application of the further cancer cotherapeutic agent. Even more preferably, this prior application takes place 2 to 8 hours (h), preferably 2 to 6 h, and more preferably 2 to 4 h before the application of the further cancer cotherapeutic agent, such as 1 to 2 h, 2 to 3 h, 3 to 6 h, 2 to 5 h or 3 to 7 h before the application of the further cancer therapeutic agent. With respect to the invention, this prior application or administration is also referred to as \"timed administration\" or \"timed application\".\n\n\nAs is shown by the data contained in this application, the effect of a timed, non-continuous administration is achieved in non-human animals, especially rats, if this prior application preferably takes place 1 to 8 hours (h), preferably\n\n\n1 to 5 h, and more preferably 1 to 3 h before the application of the further cancer cotherapeutic agent; and even more preferably this prior application takes place 2 to 8 hours (h), preferably 2 to 6 h, and more preferably 2 to 4 h before the application of the further cancer cotherapeutic agent, such as 1 to\n\n\n2 h, 2 to 3 h, 3 to 6 h, 2 to 5 h or 3 to 7 h before the application of the further cancer therapeutic agent. With respect to the invention, this prior application or administration is also referred to as \"timed administration\" or \"timed application\".\n\n\nHowever, the data from experiments with human animals preferably shows that the time of the above/below described and discussed \"prior application\" can be delayed or multiplied by the factor 1 to 4 and especially 2 to 4. This \n\n difference in the response or response time between non-human animals, especially rodents, such as rats, and human animals is known and extensively discussed in the art. While the applicant wishes not to be bound by this theory, he believes that this difference is at least in part caused by the different pharmacokinetic behavior of the different species, which i. a. reflects in different halflives (ti/\n2\n) in the different kinds of animals. For example, for compounds such as cyclopeptides, the halflives in rats usually are in the range of 10-30 minutes, whereas the halflives in human animals for the same compounds are within 2 to 6 hours and especially 3 to 4 hours.\n\n\nAccordingly, aspect of this application is a method of treatment and/or a method of manufacture as described above/below, wherein a non-continuous prior application of said integrin ligand preferably takes place 1 to 32 hours (h), preferably 2 to 32 h, more preferably 2 to 24 h, even more preferably 4 to 24 h, even more preferably 6 to 20 h and especially 6 to 16 h, before the application of the further cancer cotherapeutic agent; or alternatively preferably this prior application takes place 6 to 32 hours (h), preferably 10 to 24 h, and more preferably 12 to 20 h before the application of the further cancer cotherapeutic agent. With respect to the invention, this prior application or administration is also referred to as \"timed administration\" or \"timed application\"\n\n\nA further aspect of this application is a method of treatment and/or a method of manufacture as described above/below that also comprises a non- continuous administration of said integrin ligand, wherein the prior application preferably takes place 18 to 23 h hours (h), preferably 20 to 23 h, more preferably 20 to 22 h before the application of the further cancer cotherapeutic agent; or alternatively preferably this prior application takes place 25 to 32 h hours (h), preferably 25 to 30 h, and more preferably 26 to 30 h before the application of the further cancer cotherapeutic agent. With respect to the invention, this prior application or administration is also referred to as \"timed administration\" or \"timed application\". \n\n However, in a more preferred aspect of the instant invention, the timed administration (regardless of whether the patient is a human or nonhuman animal) of the specific integrin ligand takes place 1 to 10 hours (h), preferably\n\n\n2 to 8 h, more preferably 2 to 6 h, even more preferably 3 to 8 h, even more preferably 3 to 6 h and especially 4 to 8 h prior to the application of the one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents, e.g. 1 to 2 h, 1 to 3 h, 1 to 4 h, 2 to 3 h, 2 to 4 h, 2 to 6 h, 2 to 8 h, 2 to 10 h, 3 to 4 h, 3 to 10 h, 4 to 6 h, 4 to 10 h, 5 to 8 or 5 to 10 h. This is especially preferred if the one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents comprise external beam radiation or consist of external beam radiation. With respect to the invention, this prior application or administration is also referred to as \"timed administration\" or \"timed application\".\n\n\nWith respect to said timed administration or timed application (of the specific integrin ligand), the hours given for said prior administration or application preferably refer to the beginning or start of the respective administration or application. Accordingly, for example, an administration of the specific integrin ligand starting three hours before the application of the respective cancer cotherapeutic agent is to be regarded as a timed administration or timed application 3 h prior to the application of the one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents according to the invention, even if the specific integrin ligand is administered by i. v. Infusion that takes an hour or two hours to be completed. This definition of prior application/prior administration is in perfect concordance with the understanding of the ones skilled in the art.\n\n\nIf the at least one specific integrin ligand is administered to the patient in a timed administration as described herein, it is preferably timed with respect to the one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents it is combined with. With respect to the timed administration of the specific integrin ligand in combination with two or more cancer cotherapeutic agents, it is preferably timed with respect to the two or more cancer cotherapeutic agents, more \n\n preferably timed with respect to at least one of the cancer cotherapeutic agents. If the one or more cancer cotherapeutic agents comprise radiotherapy, especially radiotherapy as described herein, the timed administration preferably refers at least to the radiotherapy.\n\n\nEspecially preferably, the timed administration of the specific integrin ligand refers to radiotherapy as the time-relevant cancer cotherapeutic. Accordingly, in the timed administration, the prior administration of the specific integrin ligand preferably refers to a time prior to the administration of radiotherapy. However, in many cases, it can be advantageous also to administer the one or more further cancer cotherapeutic agents other than radiotherapy within the time window given by the timed administration of the specific integrin ligand and the administration or delivery of the radiotherapy.\n\n\nMore preferably, the timed administration of the specific integrin ligand refers to the administration of the specific integήn ligand and the radiotherapy, and the additional cancer cotherapeutic agent is preferably administered after the administration of the specific integrin ligand, such as 1 to 2 or 1 to 3 hours after the administration of this specific integrin ligand, but preferably before the administration or delivery of the radiotherapy, preferably at least within one hour before the administration or delivery of the radiotherapy, and more preferably at least 1 hour before radiotherapy, for example 1 to 2 or 1 to 3 h prior to the administration or delivery of the radiotherapy.\n\n\nIf two or more specific integrin ligands are administered in a timed administration as described herein, the timed and administration preferably refers at least to one or more of the specific integrin ligands and more preferably to the two or more specific integrin ligands to be administered in the timed administration as described herein.\n\n\nA preferred subject of the instant invention are treatment regimens that comprise the administration of the specific integrin ligand to a patient at an \n\n about constant dosis rate for at least 24 consecutive hours, preferably at an about constant dosis rate for at least 48 hours and especially at an about constant dosis rate for at least 72 hours. Generally, from a medical standpoint, the adminstration of the specific integrin ligand to a patient at an about constant dosis rate is not limited with regard to the duration, even durations for one or more years may be applied. From a technical or practical standpoint, however, an adminstration of the specific integrin ligand to a patient at an about constant dosis rate for about 24 hours, about 48 hours, about 72 hours, about 96 hours, about 120 hours, about 144 hours, about\n\n\n168 hours (= about one week) or even 336 hours (= about 2 weeks) appears to be feasible in most cases. If longer durations are desired, it is advantagous to split the total duration of the treatment with the specific integrin ligand at an about constant dosis rate into two or more sections, preferably sections consisting of an adminstration of the specific integrin ligand to a patient at an about constant dosis rate for about 24 hours, about 48 hours, about 72 hours, about 96 hours, about 120 hours, about 144 hours, about 168 hours (= about one week) or even 336 hours (= about 2 weeks), preferably optionally only intersected by small periods wherein the continuous administration is stopped. Small periods in this respect are preferably not longer than 72 hours, more preferably not longer than 48 hours, even more preferably not longer than 24 hours and especially not longer than 12 hours or 6 hours. For example, a small period intersection or break between two sections comprising the continuous administration of the specific integrin ligand to a patient at an about constant dosis rate as defined herein preferably takes about one hour, about two hours, about four hours, about 8 hours or about 16 hours. Generally, the shorter the small period intersection or break between two sections comprising the continuous administration of the specific integrin ligand to a patient at an about constant dosis rate as defined herein the better for the outcome of the treatment.\n\n\nMethods and devices for the continuous administration of the specific integrin ligand at an about constant dosis rate as defined herein are known to the \n\n skilled artisan. Generally, there is no limitation with respect to the methods and devices for the continuous administration of the specific integrin ligand at an about constant dosis rate as defined herein, as long as they are accepted by the physician and/or are able to proceed with the administration at an about constant dosis rate for the desired or necessary continous administration period.\n\n\nThe meaning of the term \"about constant dosis rate\" is easily understood by the ones skilled in the art. In this regard, an about constant dosis rate preferably means that the deviation between the desired dosis rate (in mg/hour) and the actually given dosis rate (in mg/hour) is less than +/- 30%, more preferably, less than +/- 20% and especially less than +/- 10%. More preferably, an about constant dosis rate preferably means that the mean deviation per hour between the desired dosis rate (in mg/hour) and the actually given dosis rate (in mg/hour) is less than +/- 30%, more preferably, less than +/- 20% and especially less than +/- 10%. Even more preferably, an about constant dosis rate preferably means that the deviation between the desired dosis rate (in mg/hour) and the actually given dosis rate (in mg/hour) is less than +/- 30%, more preferably, less than +/- 20% and especially less than +/- 10% at about all times within about 1 hour from the start of the respective continuous administration period to about 1 hour before the end of the respective continuous administration period. A deviation or mean deviation in the range of 0 to 5 % from the desired dosis rate is generally preferred in this respect.\n\n\nPreferably, dosing devices or dosing automats are used for the continuous administration as described herein.\n\n\nHowever, using standard infusion equipment is often associated with a limitation of the mobility of the patient and will thus often lead to long stays in the respective hospital or home. Thus, the use of dosing automats is generally preferred. Dosing automats that are suitable for the continuous \n\n administration of the specific integrin ligand at an about constant dosis rate are known in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to infusion pumps, electronic infusion pumps, volumetric infusion pumps and infusomats.\n\n\nHowever, suitable dosing devices or dosing automats are known in the art. For example, a liquid formulation of the specific integrin ligand can be administered to the patient by a continuous infusion, preferably a continuous i. V. infusion, using standard infusion equipment. Examples of standard infusion equipment include, but are not limited to infusion bags, infusion bags with stalagmometer or stactometer, infusion pumps, automated infusion pumps, computer controlled infusion pumps, pumps for chemotherapy, and the like. Suitable dosing devices for the continuous administration according to the invention include, but are not limited to, CADD-Legacy® Pumps, CADD-Legacy® PCA Pumps, CADD-Legacy® Pump Model 6300, Baxter COLLEAGUE Volumetric Infusion Pumps, Baxter Colleague CX Infusion Pumps, B. Braun (Melsungen) Pumps, B. Braun (Melsungen) SPACE Pumps, Fresenius Infusion Pumps, Fresenius VOLUMAT AGILIA, Fresenius VOLUMAT MC AGILIA and/or Fresenius OPTIMA MS. Currently, the CADD- Legacy® Pumps , CADD-Legacy® PCA Pumps, CADD-Legacy® Pump\n\n\nModel 6300 and/or CADD LEGACY 500ml are among the preferred dosing devices or dosing automats.\n\n\nPreferably, even longer durations of the continuous administration than those given above are generally desirious or recommended from a medical point of view, if the patient accepts the continuous administration regimen as described herein.\n\n\nIt should be understood that the administration of any combination of the present invention can optionally be accompanied by radiation therapy, wherein radiation treatment can preferably be done after the administration of the integrin ligand. The administration of the different agents of the \n\n combination therapy according to the invention can optionally also be achieved substantially concurrently or sequentially.\n\n\nIt is known that tumors elicit alternative routes for their development and growth. If one route is blocked they often have the capability to switch to another route by expressing and using other receptors and signaling pathways. Therefore, the pharmaceutical combinations of the present invention may block several of such possible development strategies of the tumor and provide consequently various therapeutic benefits. The combinations according to the present invention are useful in treating and preventing tumors, tumor-like and neoplasia disorders and tumor metastases, which develop and grow by activation of their relevant hormone receptors which are present on the surface of the tumor cells. Preferably, the different combined agents of the present invention are administered at a low dose, that is, at a dose lower than has been conventionally used in clinical situations. A benefit of lowering the dose of the compounds, compositions, agents and therapies of the present invention administered to an individual includes a decrease in the incidence of adverse effects associated with higher dosages. For example, by the lowering the dosage of an agent described above and below, a reduction in the frequency and the severity of nausea and vomiting will result when compared to that observed at higher dosages. By lowering the incidence of adverse effects, an improvement in the quality of life of a cancer patient is expected. Further benefits of lowering the incidence of adverse effects include an improvement in patient compliance, a reduction in the number of hospitalizations needed for the treatment of adverse effects, and a reduction in the administration of analgesic agents needed to treat pain associated with the adverse effects. Alternatively, the methods and combination of the present invention can also maximize the therapeutic effect at higher doses.\n\n\nTumors, preferably showing an increased expression and priming of specific cell adhesion molecules of the alpha-v-integrin series, especially α\nv\nβ3 and α\nv\nβ\n5\n in their vasculature may be successfully treated by the \n\n combinations and therapeutic regimen according to the invention. The combinations within the pharmaceutical treatment according to the invention show an astonishing synergetic effect. In administering the combination of drugs real tumor shrinking and disintegration could be observed during clinical studies while no significant adverse drug reactions were detectable.\n\n\nPreferred embodiments of the present invention relate to:\n\n\nA method for the production of a medicament for use as a combination therapy for the treatment of cancer, the medicament comprising, preferably in two distinct (discrete) application forms, a composition containing at least one specific integrin ligand for continous administration at an about constant dosis rate for at least 24 consecutive hours, and a composition containing one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, and/or at least one further cancer cotherapeutic agent different from the at least one specific integrin ligand of a) and from the one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents of b).\n\n\nA method for the treatment of cancer in a subject, comprising a) administering to the subject at least one specific integrin ligand in a manner to achieve an about zero order kinetic over at least 24 consecutive hours in said subject, b) administering to the subject one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, and/or c) administering to the subject at least one further cancer cotherapeutic agent different from the at least one specific integrin ligand of a) and from the one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents of b).\n\n\nA said medicament or method, wherein the at least one integrin ligand is selected from the group consisting of α\nv\n integrin inhibitors, preferably α\nv\nβ3 \n\n inhibitors, most preferably cyclo-CArg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal), the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof. A said medicament or method, wherein the at least one cancer-cotherapeutic agent is selected from the group consisting of chemotherapeutical agents, cytotoxic agents, immunotoxic agents and radiotherapy.\n\n\nA set for the treatment of cancer comprising independent dosage forms of: a) a therapeutically effective amount of at least one specific integrin ligand preferably being selected from the group consisting of a\nv\n integrin inhibitors, preferably α\nv\nβ\n3\n inhibitors, most preferably cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp- DPhe-NMeVal), the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and/or salts thereof, for administration at an about constant dosis rate for at least 24 consecutive hours, and b) a therapeutically effective amount of one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, and/or c) a therapeutically effective amount of at least one further cancer cotherapeutic agent different from the at least one specific integrin ligand of a) and from the one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents of b), optionally wherein a) is administered 4 to 8 hours (h), preferably 4 to 7 h, and most preferably 4 to 6 h prior to the application of b).\n\n\nSaid set is further characterized in that it will be advantageous to give detailed instructions to and how to use the cancer cotherapeutic agent, e.g. radiotherapy, in connection with the integrin ligand in form of a specific packaging, specific package inserts and similar. Therefore, a further preferred embodiment of the present invention is a medicament consisting of an integrin ligand as one active ingredient, designed to be applied in combination with a further cancer cotherapeutic agent, preferably prior to the further cancer cotherapeutic agent or more preferably to be applied continuously before, during and after the application of the further cancer cotherapeutic agent, e.g. in the case of radiotherapy, and contained in a container or similar, the container giving in form of writing \n\n detailed instructions and/or other technical information on how to use said medicament in combination with the cancer cotherapeutic agents, e.g. with respect to the above application schedule. A further preferred embodiment of the present invention is the use of at least one specific integrin ligand for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of cancer, wherein the medicament is to be used in a manner to achieve an about zero order kinetic over at least 24 consecutive hours in a patient and in combination with a) one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, and/or b) one or more further chemotherapeutic agents other than the at least one specific integrin ligand and the one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, wherein at least one specific integrin ligand, the one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents (a) and/or the one or more further chemotherapeutic agents other than the at least one specific integrin ligand and the one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents (b) are provided and/or formulated in(to) discrete application forms.\n\n\nA preferred embodiment of the present invention thus relates to a corresponding pharmaceutical composition, wherein the said integrin ligand is an α\nv\nβ\n3)\n α\nv\nβ\n5\n, αvββor α\nv\nββ integrin inhibitor; a corresponding pharmaceutical composition, wherein said integrin inhibitor is an RGD-containing linear or cyclic peptide; and, as a specific and very preferred embodiment, a said pharmaceutical composition, wherein said integrin ligand is cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal), a pharmaceutically acceptable dervative, solvate and/or salt thereof, optionally in separate containers or packages, an alkylating chemotherapeutic agent as defined herein, and optionally one or more further chemotherapeutic agents other than the at least one specific integrin ligand and the one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents as defined herein; and alternatively a pharmaceutical composition, wherein said specific integrin inhibitor is an antibody or a functionally intact derivative thereof, comprising a binding site \n\n which binds to an epitope of an integrin receptor, preferably selected from the group of antibodies or their bi- or monovalent derivatives (Fab'2)-(Fab'): LM609, 17E6, Vitaxin, Abegrin, Abciximab (7E3), P1 F6, 14D9.F8, CNTO95, humanized, chimeric and de-immunized versions thereof included, together with, optionally in separate containers or packages, an alkylating chemotherapeutic agent as defined herein, and optionally one or more further chemotherapeutic agents other than the at least one specific integrin ligand and the one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents as defined herein.\n\n\nA preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical package or kit for use in cancer therapy comprising at least one integrin ligand, preferably an α\nv\nβ\n3\n, α\nv\nβs, αvββor α\nv\nββ integrin receptor inhibiting agent, more preferably an RGD-containing linear or cyclic peptide, especially cycloCArg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal), further comprising an alkylating chemotherapeutic agent as defined herein, and optionally one or more further chemotherapeutic agents other than the at least one specific integrin ligand and the one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents as defined herein, optionally in separate containers. A further preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical package or kit, wherein said integrin ligand is an antibody or an active derivative thereof, preferably selected from the group of antibodies: LM609, P1 F6, and 14D9.F8 as well as Vitaxin, Abegrin, CNTO95, Abciximab, further comprising an alkylating chemotherapeutic agent as defined herein, and optionally one or more further chemotherapeutic agents other than the at least one specific integrin ligand and the one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents as defined herein, optionally in separate containers. Another further preferred embodiment of the present invention relates the use of a pharmaceutical composition or a pharmaceutical kit as defined above, below and in the claims, for the manufacture of a medicament to treat tumors and tumor metastases. \n\n The pharmaceutical treatment using the pharmaceutical compositions and kits according to the invention may be accompanied, concurrently or sequentially, by a radiation therapy.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical combinations and methods of the present invention provide various benefits. The combinations according to the present invention are useful in treating and preventing tumors, tumor-like and neoplasia disorders. Preferably, the different combined agents of the present invention are administered in combination at a low dose, that is, at a dose lower than has been conventionally used in clinical situations. A benefit of lowering the dose of the compounds, compositions, agents and therapies of the present invention administered to a mammal includes a decrease in the incidence of adverse effects associated with higher dosages. For example, by the lowering the dosage of a chemotherapeutic agent such as methotrexate, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, docetaxel, paclitaxel, bleomycin, cisplatin and/or Melphalan, a reduction in the frequency and the severity of nausea and vomiting will result when compared to that observed at higher dosages. Similar benefits are contemplated for the compounds, compositions, agents and therapies in combination with the integrin antagonists of the present invention. By lowering the incidence of adverse effects, an improvement in the quality of life of a cancer patient is contemplated. Further benefits of lowering the incidence of adverse effects include an improvement in patient compliance, a reduction in the number of hospitalizations needed for the treatment of adverse effects, and a reduction in the administration of analgesic agents needed to treat pain associated with the adverse effects.\n\n\nAlternatively, the methods and combination of the present invention can also maximize the therapeutic effect at higher doses.\n\n\nDetailed Description of the Invention\n\n\nIf not otherwise pointed out, the terms and phrases used in this invention preferably have the meanings and definitions as given below. Moreover, \n\n these definitions and meanings describe the invention in more detail, preferred embodiments included.\n\n\nIf not otherwise pointed out, the reference to a compound to be used according according to the invention preferably includes the reference to the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and salts thereof. If not otherwise pointed out, the reference to the integrin ligands, integrin antagonists, integrin agonists, as well as the reference to the cancer- cotherapeutic agents that are compounds, preferably includes the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and salts thereof. Even more preferably, the reference to the integrin ligand cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp- DPhe-NMeVal) also includes the pharmaceutically acceptable dervatives, solvates and salts thereof, more preferably the pharmaceutically solvates and salts thereof and especially preferably the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, if not indicated otherwise.\n\n\nBy \"combination therapy\" is preferably meant a combination of at least two distinct therapy forms so combined as to form a single therapeutical concept in a timely controlled, consecutive manner. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention this means the combination of an integrin ligand with a further cotherapeutic agent. It is important to note that \"combination therapy\" preferably does not mean a distinct and/or single pharmaceutical composition or medicament. By way of contrast, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention the integrin ligand and the further cotherapeutic agent are provided in discrete containers, packages, medicaments, formulations or equivalents. Equally, the combination of integrin ligand therapy with radiation therapy preferably lies within the meaning of \"combination therapy\" of the present invention. \"Therapy forms\" preferably are any means, uses and/or formulations for treating cancer known in the art. By the term \"distinct therapy forms\" therefore it is preferably meant that two different means, uses and/or formulations for treating cancer are combined for an improved therapy of the respective patient. In the context of the present invention it is preferred that the first to be applied therapy form has anti-integrin activity (synonym: \n\n integrin ligand), and is preferably applied prior to the second therapy form, and especially continously prior, during and/or after the second therapy form, preferably following the schedule as detailed herein. The term \"composition comprising radiotherapy\" preferably simply means that subsequent to the integrin ligand radiotherapy is applied. Therefore, the term \"composition comprising radiotherapy\" in the context of the present invention preferably does not apply to a pharmaceutical composition as such, but to a pharmaceutical composition to be used in combination with radiotherapy.\n\n\nWith \"cancer-cotherapeutic agent\" or \"cotherapeutic agent\" preferably a cytotoxic, chemotherapeutical or immunotoxic agent is meant. Equally preferred is radiotherapy. A \"receptor\" or \"receptor molecule\" is preferably a soluble or membrane bound or membrane associated protein or glycoprotein comprising one or more domains to which a ligand binds to form a receptor-ligand complex. By binding the ligand, which may be an agonist or an antagonist the receptor is activated or inactivated and may initiate or block pathway signaling. By \"ligand\" or \"receptor ligand\" is preferably meant a natural or synthetic compound which binds a receptor molecule to form a receptor-ligand complex. The term ligand includes agonists, antagonists, and compounds with partial agonist/antagonist activity.\n\n\nAn \"agonist\" or \"receptor agonist\" is preferably a natural or synthetic compound which binds the receptor to form a receptor-agonist complex by activating said receptor and receptor-agonist complex, respectively, initiating a pathway signaling and further biological processes. By \"antagonist\" or \"receptor antagonist\" is preferably meant a natural or synthetic compound that has a biological effect opposite to that of an agonist. An antagonist binds the receptor and blocks the action of a receptor agonist by competing with the agonist for receptor. An antagonist is defined by its ability to block the actions of an agonist. A receptor antagonist may be also an antibody or an immunotherapeutically effective fragment thereof. \n\n Preferred antagonists according to the present invention are cited and discussed below.\n\n\nThe term \"integrin antagonists / inhibitors\" or \"integrin receptor antagonists / inhibitors\" preferably refers to a natural or synthetic molecule, preferably a synthetic molecule, that blocks and inhibit an integrin receptor. In some cases, the term includes antagonists directed to the ligands of said integrin receptors (such as for α\nv\nβ\n3\n: vitronectin, fibrin, fibrinogen, von Willebrand's factor, thrombospondin, laminin; for α\nv\nβs: vitronectin; for α\nv\nβi'. fibronectin and vitronectin; for α\nv\nβ6'- fibronectin). Antagonists directed to the integrin receptors are preferred according to the invention. Integrin (receptor) antagonists may be natural or synthetic peptides, non-peptides, peptidomimetica, immunoglobulins, such as antibodies or functional fragments thereof, or immunoconjugates (fusion proteins). Preferred integrin inhibitors of the invention are directed to receptor of α\nv\n integrins (e.g. α\nv\nβ\n3\n, α\nv\nβ\n5\n, α\nv\nβ\n6\n and sub-classes). Preferred integrin inhibitors are α\nv\n antagonists, and in particular α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists. Preferred α\nv\n antagonists according to the invention are RGD peptides, peptidomimetic (non-peptide) antagonists and anti-integrin receptor antibodies such as antibodies blocking cxv receptors.\n\n\nExemplary, non-immunological α\nv\nβ\n3\n antagonists are described in the teachings of US 5,753,230 and US 5,766,591. Preferred antagonists are linear and cyclic RGD-containing peptides. Cyclic peptides are, as a rule, more stable and elicit an enhanced serum half-life. The most preferred integrin antagonist of the invention is, however, cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-\n\n\nNMeVaI) (EMD 121974, Cilengitide\n®\n, Merck KGaA, Germany; EP 0770 622) which is efficacious in blocking the integrin receptors α\nv\nβ\n3\n, α\nv\nβi, α\nv\nββ, α\nv\nββ. ocιι\nb\nβ\n3\n, and preferably especially efficacious with respect to integrin receptors α\nv\nβ\n3\n and/or α\nv\nβs. As is clear to the ones skilled in the art, the cyclo- (Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) can be also applied in the context of the instant invention in the form of a physiologically functional derivative, physiologically acceptable derivative, a solvate and/or a salt thereof. The same preferably \n\n also applies to all other compounds or active ingredients to be used in the context of the present invention.\n\n\nSuitable peptidyl as well as peptidomimetic (non-peptide) antagonists of the α\nv\nβ3 / α\nv\nβδ / α\nv\nββ integrin receptor have been described both in the scientific and patent literature. For example, reference is made to Hoekstra and Poulter, 1998, Curr. Med. Chem. 5, 195; WO 95/32710; WO 95/37655; WO 97/01540; WO 97/37655; WO 97/45137; WO 97/41844; WO 98/08840; WO 98/18460; WO 98/18461 ; WO 98/25892; WO 98/31359; WO 98/30542; WO 99/15506; WO 99/15507; WO 99/31061 ; WO 00/06169; EP 0853 084; EP 0854 140; EP 0854 145; US 5,780,426; and US 6,048,861. Patents that disclose benzazepine, as well as related benzodiazepine and benzocycloheptene α\nv\nβ\n3\n integrin receptor antagonists, which are also suitable for the use in this invention, include WO 96/00574, WO 96/00730, WO 96/06087, WO 96/26190, WO 97/24119, WO 97/24122, WO 97/24124, WO 98/15278, WO 99/05107, WO 99/06049, WO 99/15170, WO 99/15178, WO 97/34865, WO 97/01540, WO 98/30542, WO 99/11626, and WO 99/15508. Other integrin receptor antagonists featuring backbone conformational ring constraints have been described in WO 98/08840; WO 99/30709; WO 99/30713; WO 99/31099; WO 00/09503; US 5,919,792; US 5,925,655; US 5,981 ,546; and US 6,017,926. In US 6,048,861 and WO 00/72801 a series of nonanoic acid derivatives which are potent α\nv\nβ3 integrin receptor antagonists were disclosed. Other chemical small molecule integrin antagonists (mostly vitronectin antagonists) are described in WO 00/38665. Other α\nv\nβ\n3\n receptor antagonists have been shown to be effective in inhibiting angiogenesis. For example, synthetic receptor antagonists such as (S)-10,11-Dihydro-3-[3-(pyridin-2-ylamino)-1-propyloxy]-5H- dibenzo[ a,d]cycloheptene-10-acetic acid (known as SB-265123) have been tested in a variety of mammalian model systems. (Keenan et al., 1998, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 8(22), 3171 ; Ward et al., 1999, Drug Metab. Dispos. 27(11 ), 1232). Assays for the identification of integrin antagonists suitable for use as an antagonist are described, e.g. by Smith et al., 1990, J. Biol. Chem. 265, 12267, and in the referenced patent literature. \n\n Anti-integrin receptor antibodies are also well known. Suitable anti-integrin (e.g. α\nv\nβ3, otvβs, α\nv\nβ6) monoclonal antibodies can be modified to encompass antigen binding fragments thereof, including F(ab)\n2\n, Fab, and engineered Fv or single-chain antibody. One suitable and preferably used monoclonal antibody directed against integrin receptor α\nv\nβ\n3\n is identified as LM609 (Brooks et al., 1994, Cell 79, 1157; ATCC HB 9537). A potent specific anti-α\nv\nβ5 antibody, P1F6, is disclosed in WO 97/45447, which is also preferred according to this invention. A further suitable α\nv\nβ\nθ\n selective antibody is MAb 14D9.F8 (WO 99/37683, DSM ACC2331 , Merck KGaA,\n\n\nGermany) which is selectively directed to the α\nv\n- chain of integrin receptors. Another suitable anti-integrin antibody is the commercialized Vitraxin \n®\n. The term \"antibody\" or \"immunoglobulin\" herein is preferably used in the broadest sense and specifically covers intact monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g. bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, and antibody fragments, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity. The term generally includes heteroantibodies which are composed of two or more antibodies or fragments thereof of different binding specificity which are linked together.\n\n\nDepending on the amino acid sequence of their constant regions, intact antibodies can be assigned to different \"antibody (immunoglobulin) classes\". There are five major classes of intact antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into \"subclasses\" (isotypes), e.g., IgGI , lgG2, lgG3, lgG4, IgA, and lgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called α, δ, ε, γ and μ respectively. Preferred major class for antibodies according to the invention is IgG, in more detail IgGI and lgG2.\n\n\nAntibodies are usually glycoproteins having a molecular weight of about\n\n\n150,000, composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy\n\n\n(H) chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intra-chain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at \n\n one end a variable domain (VH) followed by a number of constant domains. The variable regions comprise hypervariable regions or \"CDR\" regions, which contain the antigen binding site and are responsible for the specificity of the antibody, and the \"FR\" regions, which are important with respect to the affinity / avidity of the antibody. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a \"complementarity determining region\" or \"CDR\" (e.g. residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; and/or those residues from a \"hypervariable loop\" (e.g. residues 26-32 (L1 ), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk J. MoI. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)).The \"FR\" residues (frame work region) are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end (VL) and a constant domain at its other end. The constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain, and the light-chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The \"light chains\" of antibodies from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types, called kappa (K) and lambda (λ), based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains. The term \"monoclonal antibody\" as used herein preferably refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. In addition to their specificity, the \n\n monoclonal antibodies are advantageous in that they may be synthesized uncontaminated by other antibodies. Methods for making monoclonal antibodies include the hybridoma method described by Kohler and Milstein (1975, Nature 256, 495) and in \"Monoclonal Antibody Technology, The\n\n\nProduction and Characterization of Rodent and Human Hybridomas\" (1985, Burdon et al., Eds, Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Volume 13, Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam), or may be made by well known recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., US 4,816,567). Monoclonal antibodies may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al., Nature, 352:624-628 (1991) and Marks et al., J. MoI. Biol., 222:58, 1-597(1991 ), for example. The term \"chimeric antibody\" preferably means antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (e.g.: US 4,816,567; Morrison et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., USA, 81 :6851-6855 (1984)). Methods for making chimeric and humanized antibodies are also known in the art. For example, methods for making chimeric antibodies include those described in patents by Boss (Celltech) and by Cabilly (Genentech) (US 4,816,397; US 4,816,567).\n\n\n\"Humanized antibodies\" preferably are forms of non-human (e.g., rodent) chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region (CDRs) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity and capacity. In some instances, framework region (FR) residues of the \n\n human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Methods for making humanized antibodies are described, for example, by Winter (US 5,225,539) and Boss (Celltech, US 4,816,397). \"Antibody fragments\" preferably comprise a portion of an intact antibody, preferably comprising the antigen-binding or variable region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv and Fc fragments, diabodies, linear antibodies, single-chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragment(s). An \"intact\" antibody is one which comprises an antigen-binding variable region as well as a light chain constant domain (CL) and heavy chain constant domains,\n\n\nCH1 , CH2 and CH3. Preferably, the intact antibody has one or more effector functions. Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen- binding fragments, called \"Fab\" fragments, each comprising a single antigen- binding site and a CL and a CH1 region, and a residual \"Fc\" fragment, whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. The \"Fc\" region of the antibodies comprises, as a rule, a CH2, CH3 and the hinge region of an IgGI or lgG2 antibody major class. The hinge region is a group of about 15 amino acid residues which combine the CH1 region with the CH2-CH3 region. Pepsin treatment yields an \"F(ab')2\" fragment that has two antigen-binding sites and is still capable of cross-linking antigen. \"Fv\" is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen-recognition and antigen- binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy chain and one light chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. It is in this \n\n configuration that the three hypervariable regions (CDRs) of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding site on the surface of the VH - VL dimer. Collectively, the six hypervariable regions confer antigen- binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain\n\n\n(or half of an Fv comprising only three hypervariable regions specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site. The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH 1 ) of the heavy chain. \"Fab\" fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. F(ab')2 antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab' fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known (see e.g. Hermanson, Bioconjugate Techniques, Academic Press, 1996; US 4,342,566). \"Single-chain Fv\" or \"scFv\" antibody fragments preferably comprise the V, and V, domains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a Single polypeptide chain. Preferably, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. Single-chain FV antibodies are known, for example, from Plϋckthun {The Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies, Vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds., Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994)), WO93/16185; US 5,571 ,894; US 5,587,458; Huston et al. (1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85, 5879) or Skerra and Plueckthun (1988, Science 240, 1038). \"Bispecific antibodies\" preferably are single, divalent antibodies (or immunotherapeutically effective fragments thereof) which have two differently specific antigen binding sites. For example the first antigen binding site is directed to an angiogenesis receptor (e.g. integrin or VEGF receptor), whereas the second antigen binding site is directed to an ErbB receptor (e.g. EGFR or Her 2). Bispecific antibodies can be produced by chemical techniques (see e.g., Kranz et al. (1981 ) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78, 5807), by \"polydoma\" techniques (See US 4,474,893) or by recombinant \n\n DNA techniques, which all are known per se. Further methods are described in WO 91/00360, WO 92/05793 and WO 96/04305. Bispecific antibodies can also be prepared from single chain antibodies (see e.g., Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85, 5879; Skerra and Plueckthun (1988) Science 240,\n\n\n1038). These are analogues of antibody variable regions produced as a single polypeptide chain. To form the bispecific binding agent, the single chain antibodies may be coupled together chemically or by genetic engineering methods known in the art. It is also possible to produce bispecific antibodies according to this invention by using leucine zipper sequences. The sequences employed are derived from the leucine zipper regions of the transcription factors Fos and Jun (Landschulz et ai, 1988, Science 240,1759; for review, see Maniatis and Abel, 1989, Nature 341 , 24). Leucine zippers are specific amino acid sequences about 20-40 residues long with leucine typically occurring at every seventh residue. Such zipper sequences form amphipathic α-helices, with the leucine residues lined up on the hydrophobic side for dimer formation. Peptides corresponding to the leucine zippers of the Fos and Jun proteins form heterodimers preferentially (O'Shea et al., 1989, Science 245, 646). Zipper containing bispecific antibodies and methods for making them are also disclosed in WO 92/10209 and WO 93/11162. A bispecific antibody according the invention may be an antibody, directed to VEGF receptor and αvβ3 receptor as discussed above with respect to the antibodies having single specificity. \"Heteroantibodies\" preferably are two or more antibodies or antibody-binding fragments which are linked together, each of them having a different binding specificity. Heteroantibodies can be prepared by conjugating together two or more antibodies or antibody fragments. Preferred heteroantibodies are comprised of cross-linked Fab/Fab\n1\n fragments. A variety of coupling or crosslinking agents can be used to conjugate the antibodies. Examples are protein A, carboimide, N-succinimidyl-S-acetyl-thioacetate (SATA) and N- succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) (see e.g., Karpovsky et al. (1984) J. EXP. Med. 160,1686; Liu et a. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 8648). Other methods include those described by Paulus, Behring Inst. \n\n Mitt., No. 78, 118 (1985); Brennan et a. (1985) Science 30 Method:81 or Glennie et al. (1987) J. Immunol. 139, 2367. Another method uses o- phenylenedimaleimide (oPDM) for coupling three Fab\n1\n fragments (WO 91/03493).

Said adjunctive agents prevent or reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or operation, or reduce the incidence of infection associated with the administration of myelosuppressive anticancer drugs. Adjunctive agents are well known in the art. The immunotherapeutic agents according to the invention can additionally administered with adjuvants like BCG and immune system stimulators. Furthermore, the compositions may include immunotherapeutic agents or chemotherapeutic agents which contain cytotoxic effective radio labeled isotopes, or other cytotoxic agents, such as a cytotoxic peptides (e.g. cytokines) or cytotoxic drugs and the like. The term \"pharmaceutical kit\" for treating tumors or tumor metastases refers to a package and, as a rule, instructions for using the reagents in methods to treat tumors and tumor metastases. A reagent in a kit of this invention is typically formulated as a therapeutic composition as described herein, and therefore can be in any of a variety of forms suitable for distribution in a kit. Such forms can include a liquid, powder, tablet, suspension and the like formulation for providing the antagonist and/or the fusion protein of the present invention. The reagents may be provided in separate containers suitable for administration separately according to the present methods, or alternatively may be provided combined in a composition in a single container in the package. The package may contain an amount sufficient for one or more dosages of reagents according to the treatment methods described herein. A kit of this invention also contains \"instruction for use\" of the materials contained in the package. \n\n As used herein, the terms \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" and grammatical variations thereof, as they refer to compositions, carriers, diluents and reagents, are used interchangeably and represent that the materials are capable of administration to or upon a mammal without the production of undesirable physiological effects such as nausea, dizziness, gastric upset and the like. The preparation of a pharmacological composition that contains active ingredients dissolved or dispersed therein is well understood in the art and need not be limited based on formulation. Typically, such compositions are prepared as injectables either as liquid solutions or suspensions, however, solid forms suitable for solution, or suspensions, in liquid prior to use can also be prepared. The preparation can also be emulsified. The active ingredient can be mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient and in amounts suitable for use in the therapeutic methods described herein.\n\n\nSuitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol or the like and combinations thereof. In addition, if desired, the composition can contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents., pH buffering agents and the like which enhance the effectiveness of the active ingredient. The therapeutic composition of the present invention can include pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the components therein. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide) that are formed with inorganic acids such as. for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, tartaric, mandelic and the like. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine and the like. Particularly preferred is the HCI salt when used in the preparation of cyclic polypeptide αv antagonists. Physiologically tolerable carriers are well known in the art. Exemplary of liquid carriers are sterile aqueous solutions that contain no materials in addition to the active ingredients and water, or \n\n contain a buffer such as sodium phosphate at physiological pH value, physiological saline or both, such as phosphate-buffered saline. Still further, aqueous carriers can contain more than one buffer salt, as well as salts such as sodium and potassium chlorides, dextrose, polyethylene glycol and other solutes. Liquid compositions can also contain liquid phases in addition to and to the exclusion of water. Exemplary of such additional liquid phases are glycerin, vegetable oils such as cottonseed oil, and water-oil emulsions. Typically, a therapeutically effective amount of an immunotherapeutic agent in the form of a, for example, antibody or antibody fragment or antibody conjugate is an amount such that when administered in physiologically tolerable composition is sufficient to achieve a plasma concentration of from about 0.01 microgram (μg) per milliliter (ml) to about 100 μg/ml, preferably from about 1 μg/ml to about 5 μg/ml and usually about 5 μg/ml. Stated differently the dosage can vary from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 300 mg/kg, preferably from about 0.2 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg, most preferably from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, in one or more dose administrations daily for one or several days. Where the immunotherapeutic agent is in the form of a fragment of a monoclonal antibody or a conjugate, the amount can readily be adjusted based on the mass of the fragment / conjugate relative to the mass of the whole antibody. A preferred plasma concentration in molarity is from about 2 micromolar (μM) to about 5 millimolar (mM) and preferably, about 100 μM to 1 mM antibody antagonist. A therapeutically effective amount of an agent according of this invention which is a non- immunotherapeutic peptide or a protein polypeptide (e.g. IFN-alpha), or other similarly-sized small molecule, is typically an amount of polypeptide such that when administered in a physiologically tolerable composition is sufficient to achieve a plasma concentration of from about 0.1 microgram (μg) per milliliter (ml) to about 200 μg/ml, preferably from about 1 μg/ml to about 150 μg/ml. Based on a polypeptide having a mass of about 500 grams per mole, the preferred plasma concentration in molarity is from about 2 micromolar (μM) to about 5 millimolar (mM) and preferably about 100 μM to 1 mM \n\n polypeptide antagonist. The typical dosage of an active agent, which is a preferably a chemical antagonist or a (chemical) chemotherapeutic agent according to the invention (neither an immunotherapeutic agent nor a non- immunotherapeutic peptide/protein) is 10 mg to 1000 mg, preferably about 20 to 200 mg, and more preferably 50 to 100 mg per kilogram body weight per day. The preferred dosage of an active agent, which is a preferably a chemical antagonist or a (chemical) chemotherapeutic agent according to the invention (neither an immunotherapeutic agent nor a non-immunotherapeutic peptide/protein) is 0.5 mg to 3000 mg per patient and day, more preferably 10 to 2500 mg per patient and per day, and especially 50 to 1000 mg per patient and per day, or, per kilogram body weight, preferably about 0.1 to 100 mg/kg, and more preferably 1 mg to 50 mg/kg, preferably per dosage unit and more preferably per day, or, per square meter of the bodysurface, preferably 0.5 mg to 2000 mg/m\n2\n, more preferably 5 to 1500 mg/m\n2\n, and especially 50 to 1000 mg/m\n2\n, preferably per dosage unit and more preferably per day.\n\n\nThe term \"therapeutically effective\" or \"therapeutically effective amount\" refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat a disease or disorder in a mammal. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and/or determining the response rate (RR).\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"physiologically functional derivative\" preferably refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable derivative of a compound to be used according to the present invention, for example, an ester or an amide, \n\n which upon administration to a mammal is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of the present invention or an active metabolite thereof. Such derivatives are clear to those skilled in the art, without undue experimentation, and with reference to the teaching of Burger's Medicinal\n\n\nChemistry And Drug Discovery, 5th Edition, Vo1 1 : Principles and Practice, which is incorporated herein by reference to the extent that it teaches physiologically functional derivatives. As used herein, the term \"solvate\" preferably refers to a complex of variable stoichiometry formed by a solute (in this invention, a specific integrin ligand and/or a further cancer cotherapeutic agent (or a salt or physiologically functional derivative thereof)) and a solvent. Such solvents for the purpose of the invention may not interfere with the biological activity of the solute. Examples of suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, water, methanol, ethanol and acetic acid. Preferably the solvent used is a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent. Examples of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable solvents include, without limitation, water, ethanol and acetic acid. Most preferably the solvent used is water. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds to be used according to the invention and their preparation is known in the art. If the compound itself is not a salt, it can be easily transferred into a salt by addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or of a pharmaceutically acceptable base. Pharmaceutically acceptable acids and bases are known in the art, for example from the literature cited herein.\n\n\nThe compounds to be used according to the invention, preferably the specific integrin ligand and/or at least one further cancer cotherapeutic agent different from the at least one specific integrin ligand, can generally be administered to the patient in a form and in a way or manner that is known in the art for the respective compounds or class of compounds, for example as described herein or as described in the literature cited herein.\n\n\nThe specific integrin ligand cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) is preferably applied as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, more preferably the \n\n pharmacologically acceptable hydrochloride salt, and especially preferably applied as the inner (or internal) salt, which is the compound cyclo-(Arg-Gly-\n\n\nAsp-DPhe-NMeVal) as such.\n\n\nWith regard to the specific integrin ligand cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal), the following kinds of writing the name are preferably to be regarded as equivalent: cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-[NMe]Val) = cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-[NMe]-Val) = cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) = cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) = cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) = cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val) =\n\n\nCRGDfNMeV = C(RGDfNMeV).\n\n\nThe specific integrin ligand cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) is also referred to as Cilengitide, which is the INN (International Non-propriety Name) of said compound.\n\n\nThe specific integrin ligand cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMeVal) is also described in EP 0 770 622 A, US 6,001 ,961 , WO 00/15244 and PCT/US07/01446 of the same applicant, the disclosure of which is explicitly incorporated into the instant application by reference.\n\n\nRecent results show that inhibiting integrins, especially αvβ3 and/or αvβ5, commonly expressed in various cancerous cells, can significantly decrease the resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and/or ionising radiation of otherwise chemo- or radioresistant cancerous cells and/or can induce an increased sensitivity of cancerous cells towards chemotherapeutic agents and/or ionising radiation.\n\n\nAccordingly, specific integrin ligands, especially integrin ligands specific to α\nv\nβ\n3\n and/or α\nv\nβ\n5\n integrins according to the invention can be successfully applied to improve the efficacy of various cancer cotherapeutic agents. \n\n For example, a phase I clinical study used cilengitide treatment in a dose escalation study on various brain tumors (NABT 9911 ). In some of the GBM patients in this study, an indication of response was seen. Cilengitide (= cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val), in very marked contrast to most cancer therapeutics currently in use has a very innocuous side effect profile, with no known MTD in humans - and is very well tolerated.\n\n\nIn addition to the essentially 100% mortality in GBM patients (2-year survival rate about 25%), the morbidity from neurological complications also rapidly degrades the quality of life (QOL).\n\n\nFor example, the standard of treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, associating radiotherapy and temozolomide, has only increased the median survival of resected patients by 2.5 months (12.1 -> 14.6 months) compared to radiotherapy alone (Stupp et al., 2005). However, in combination with at least one specific integrin ligand according to the invention, preferably selected from Vitaxtn, Abegrin, CNTO95 and cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe- VaI), more preferably selected from Vitaxin, Abegrin and cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp- DPhe-NMe-Val) and especially preferably cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe- VaI), this standard treatment shows significantly improved efficacy with respect to an increased median survival and quality of life. The literature cited in this paragraph is explicitly incorporated into the disclosure of the instant application by reference.\n\n\nSCCHN: Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck (also referred to as Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck): The annual worldwide incidence of squamous cell cancer of the head and neck is estimated at 500,000 patients; in the United States and Europe, 118.000 new patients are diagnosed annually. SCCHN is more predominant in males with a male:female ratio of 2:1-4:1. There is a positive relationship between smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and head and neck cancer. Approximately 90% of all head and neck malignancies are of squamous cell \n\n histology (SCCHN). Most patients are diagnosed with SCCHN at an age of\n\n\n50-70 years.\n\n\nA majority of patients (75%) have locally advanced disease at diagnosis. Those patients are mainly treated with radiotherapy and in some cases surgery. Newer strategies such as induction chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy could provide better survival; however, the 5-year survival rate remains around 30%, and 60% of subjects will experience a loco-regional or distant relapse within 2 years of initial treatment. The group of subjects with recurrent disease and/or with newly diagnosed distant metastases has very heterogeneous disease characteristics. Their median survival time, however, remains around 6-8 months with a poor quality of life. This dismal prognosis has not changed in the past 30 years. The standard chemotherapeutic treatments for recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN include drugs such as methotrexate, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil (5- FU), and platinum compounds. Promising phase Il results with new agents such as taxanes could not be confirmed in phase Ml studies. Cisplatin is the most widely used drug for the treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN and, as such, is considered the standard treatment in this indication. Overall, all published randomized trials suggest that cisplatin and 5-FU in combination produced higher response rates compared to single agents and most of the other combinations. In general, combination therapy was associated with higher hematological and non-hematological toxicity. The combination of cisplatin plus 5-FU produced a small but questionable improvement over monotherapy with a median survival of 6 to 8 months.\n\n\nCarboplatin + 5-FU containing regimens are also frequently used because of their better safety profile (lower renal, otologic, neurologic, and gastrointestinal toxicity than cisplatin). Response rates and survival are not statistically different from cisplatin-based regimens. Carboplatin is therefore approved for the treatment of SCCHN in several European countries. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed in nearly all SCCHN. EGFR expression carries a strong prognostic significance, providing the rationale for using EGFR-targeted agents, such as cetuximab (Erbitux®), \n\n in this indication (Burtness, JCO 2005; Bourhis, JCO 2006). Erbitux is approved in the U.S. for monotherapy of metastatic disease, and in combination with radiotherapy for unresectable SCCHN, where it has demonstrated a prolongation of survival by 20 months.\n\n\nA phase III trial with the combination of Cis- or Carboplatinum, 5-FU and Erbitux has been demonstrated to significantly prolong the median survival time in patients with locally recurrent/metastatic SCCHN. The observed median survival time of 10.1 months is among the longest ever reported in a phase III trial for these patients. The literature cited in this paragraph is explicitly incorporated into the disclosure of the instant application by reference.\n\n\nNSCLC: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. About 170,000 new cases of lung cancer and 160,000 deaths due to this disease per year occur in the United States alone. NSCLC accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancers. At the time of diagnosis, approximately 30% of NSCLC patients present with locally advanced, and 40% with metastatic disease. Surgical results in earlier stages are poor compared to other tumor types (about 40% of recurrence in stages l-ll). In metastatic disease, chemotherapy is the treatment of choice, but survival benefits have been modest, resulting in one-year survival of 40%, and five-year survival of less than 15%. It is commonly accepted that the standard treatment for advanced disease (stage IV and IHb with malignant pleural effusion) consists of platin-based (cisplatin or carboplatin) chemotherapy. However, there are many open questions in the management of these patients, such as the role of combination therapy regimen including more than two drugs, non-platinum- based therapies, and new targeted therapeutical approaches.\n\n\nCurrently, response rates of about 20%-30% and median survival times of 6 to 11 months have been observed in the treatment of metastatic NSCLC. Several chemotherapy combinations are used with comparable efficacy. The \n\n combinations of cis-/carboplatin plus vinorelbine, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, or docetaxel are among the regimens most commonly used for first-line therapy of metastatic NSCLC. A phase III trial has been initiated based on the results of a randomized phase Il trial in 86 patients treated with cisplatin/vinorelbine plus cetuximab versus cisplatin/ vinorelbine alone. The phase Il trial revealed an advantage of the cetuximab combination with regard to overall response rate (53% in the experimental arm and 32% in the control arm [Gatzemeier, ASCO 2003, abstract # 2582]). The phase III trial planned to include 1100 patients (550 per arm), and was powered to demonstrate an increase in median overall survival from 7 months (standard arm) to 10 months (combination with Erbitux). This study has already finished enrollment, and first results are expected soon. The literature cited in this paragraph is explicitly incorporated into the disclosure of the instant application by reference.\n\n\nSCLC: Small Cell Lung Cancer\n\n\nSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15-20% of all lung cancer cases in the world, equating to approximately 80,000 new patients every year. A recent analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database confirmed that in the United States, the proportion of small cell lung cancer patients has decreased from about 20% to 13.8% in 1998, likely due to the implementation of smoking cessation programs. This success, however, is to some extent outweighed by the high and rising prevalence of tobacco smoking in other parts of the world.\n\n\nSCLC is typically disseminated at the time of presentation, with approximately 60% to 70% of patients having disseminated (extensive-stage) disease at presentation. Thus, surgery is rarely an option, and applies only to patients with localized (limited) disease. Relapse and death from SCLC is imminent even in patients who are treated with surgical resection. Without other therapy than surgery, survival was 2 months for patients with extensive- stage SCLC and 3 months for patients with limited-stage SCLC (Green, Am J Med 1969). \n\n Systemic combination chemotherapy remains the mainstay of SCLC treatment, both in limited and extensive stage of their disease. For more than 20 years, etoposide and cis-/carboplatin are considered the current standard agents used in combination for the first-line treatment of patients with SCLC in the Western world. Combination therapy with more than two drugs in clinical trials has resulted in higher response rates, but also higher toxicity, and did not result in a clinically relevant overall survival benefit. A combination regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine was shwn to be equally effective as the platinum/etoposide combination, but has a more unfavourable toxicity profile due to the inclusion of an anthracycline. In Japan, cisplatin plus irinotecan is used more frequently for the first-line treatment of SCLC after a Japanese trial has yielded favourable overall survival. Studies in the Western hemisphere, however, were not able to confirm those results, thus, this regimen is not used as widely in that part of the world.\n\n\nIn extensive stage SCLC, overall response rates to chemotherapy range from 40% to 70%. Time to progression is short, with the majority of patients progressing within 3 months of completing chemotherapy. The median survival is 7 to 11 months. Less than 5% of patients survive longer than 2 years. The literature cited in this paragraph is explicitly incorporated into the disclosure of the instant application by reference.\n\n\nThus, even in view of the results achieved within the last years, the prognosis of the patients regarding most cancerous diseases is still very grim. Thus, there is a need for improved medicaments, therapy methods and treatment regimen.\n\n\nIt is an objective of the instant invention to provide such improved medicaments, therapy methods and treatment regimens.\n\n\nThus, subject of the instant invention is: \n\n [1] The use of at least one specific integrin ligand for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of cancer, wherein the medicament is administered to a patient in a manner to achieve an about zero order kinetic over at least 24 consecutive hours in said patient, preferably administered continuously to a patient in a manner to achieve an about zero order kinetic over at least 24 consecutive hours in said patient, and wherein the medicament is to be used in combination with at least one further agent, selected from a) one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, and b) one or more further chemotherapeutic agents other than the at least one specific integrin ligand and the one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents.\n\n\n[2] The use of at least one specific integrin ligand for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of cancer, wherein the medicament is to be provided to a patient by continous administration at an about constant dosis rate for at least 24 consecutive hours, and wherein the medicament is to be used in combination with at least one further agent, selected from a) one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, and b) one or more further chemotherapeutic agents other than the at least one specific integrin ligand and the one or more alkylating chemotherapeutic agents.\n\n\nThe use as described herein and especially the use as described in the paragraph numbered [1], wherein the administration to the patient in a manner to achieve an about zero order kinetic is performed over at least 48 hours, over at least 72 hours, over at least 96 hours, over at least 120 hours, over at least 144 hours, over at least 168 hours (= over at least one week) or even at least 336 hours (= over at least 2 weeks).

Thus, the treatment of cancer with chemotherapeutic agents generally includes a prolonged exposure to the one or more respective chemotherapeutic agents. Taking into account that most of the chemotherapeutic agents, when applied in an efficient dose, are toxic for the body of the patient, the chemotherapeutic agents (unless they show any or hardly any acute toxicity) are generally applied over a certain, limited time, followed by a time period without the administration of the respective chemotherapeutic agent, during which time the patient's body is allowed to recover from the toxicity of said chemotherapeutic agent, generally, this treatment regimen comprising the application time period of the respective chemotherapeutic agent and the recovery time period after the application of the respective chemotherapeutic agent is repeated one or more times, preferably several times. This kind of regimen is usually referred to by the skilled artisan as \"cycles\", each cycle comprising the application time period of the respective chemotherapeutic agent and the recovery time period after the application of the respective chemotherapeutic agent. The duration of the application time period and/or the recovery time period after the application of the chemotherapeutic are usually depending on the properties of the respective chemotherapeutic agent. Accordingly, different chemotherapeutic agents can have different durations of the application time period and/or the recovery time period after the of the chemotherapeutic. Thus, the length or duration of a cycle can be different for different chemotherapeutic agents. Generally, the length of a cycle is in between one week and 12 weeks, more preferably one week to six weeks and especially 2 to 4 weeks. Preferably, the dosing of the respective chemotherapeutic agent is given in an amount per cycle, allowing the the physicist to adapt the actual administration to the status of the patient, i.e. whether the amount per cycle is given in one single administration or divided into two or more portions administered at different times within the cycle. In \n\n the setting of a combination treatment comprising two or more chemotherapeutic agents, generally two or more cycles (having the same or a different length) run in parallel. If the chemotherapeutic agent is administered to the patient in two or more portions within one cycle, each portion is preferably given on a different day within said cycle. With respect to each of the chemotherapeutics administered, generally more than one cycle, preferably two or more cycles, even more preferably three or more cycles are applied to the patient, preferably substantially with out a pause. Generally, not more than 24 cycles are applied to the patient substantially without a pause. The application of about six cycles substantially without a pause to the patient for each of the chemotherapeutics administered is generally a standard for of many of the chemotherapeutics described herein.\n\n\nAccordingly, the time period of 2 to 4 weeks referred to in the paragraph numbered [15], wherein the platinum containing chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaϊφiatin are administered to the patient in an amount of 100 to 1000 mg in one or more portions (within said time period of 2 to 4 weeks) is preferably to be regarded as one cycle. More preferably, the time period or cycle, wherein the platinum containing therapeutic agent is administered is about three weeks (about 21 days). With respect to oxaliplatin, following administration is also preferred: oxaliplatin is preferably administered to the patient in an amount of 50 to 500 mg in one or more portions, preferably one portion, within a time period of about two weeks. Accordingly, the duration of a cycle with respect to oxaliplatin is preferably about two weeks.\n\n\nGenerally, the cisplatin can be administered to the patient as is known in the art. Preferably, cisplatin is administered to the patient in an amount of 50 mg to 500 mg within one cycle, more preferably 80 mg to 300 mg within one cycle. Preferably, the amount of cisplatin is administered to the patient is given in mg per square metre of the by the surface of the patient, i.e. in mg/m\n2\n. Accordingly, cisplatin is preferably administered to the patient in an \n\n amount of 50 to 250 mg/m\n2\n, more preferably 80 to 160 mg/m\n2\n and especially about 80 or 100 mg/m\n2\n within one cycle.\n\n\nThe amount cisplatin can be administered in one or more portions, more preferably 1 to 5 portions, even more preferred 1 to 3 and especially preferably in one portion on one day. Generally, cisplatin is administered as an i. V. infusion.\n\n\nGenerally, the carboplatin can be administered to the patient as is known in the art.\n\n\nPreferably, carboplatin is administered to the patient in an amount of 200 mg to 1000 mg within one cycle, more preferably 300 mg to 800 mg within one cycle and especially 400 to 700 mg within one cycle. Even more preferably, the carboplatin is administered to the patient in an AUC (Area Under the Curve) regimen, more specifically an AUC 4-8 regimen (4-8 mg/ml/min), preferably an AUC 5-7 regimen (5-7 mg/ml/min). The principles of the AUC regimen or dosing are known in the art.

The results suggest that cancer cotherapeutic agents, such as radiation, can induce expression of relevant integrins in lung cancer cells, and/or that the specific integrin ligand is acting as an amplifier of efficacy, e.g. as a radio amplifier. Moreover, combined application of at least one specific integrin ligand and at least one cancer cotherapeutic agent, preferably radiation, results in significant cell kill and thus reduced survival curves of the respective treated cells considerably. Accordingly, the combinations appear to effectively induce cell death, likely due to apoptosis and/or mitotic cell death, in endothelial cells and tumour cells, especially in lung cancer cells and especially in non-small cell lung cancer cells. The extent of effect may depend on the degree of target expression, i.e. integrin expression.

One or more of the compounds i), ii), iii) and iv) can preferably be also administered as the pharmaceutically accetable salts thereof (or as another pharmaceutically accetable salt therof, if the respectice compound i), ii), iii) and/or iv) is already a pharmaceutically accetable salt). In this method, the admistration of i), ii), iii) and/or iv) preferably takes place serially or concomitantly.\n\n\nWith respect to the instant invention, subjects (with regard to administration) are preferably human subjects. \n\n With respect to the instant invention, patients are preferably human patients.\n\n\nThe specific integrin ligands to be used according to the invention surprisingly show an advantageously improved effect on patients that are having increased DNA methylation status, are having a partial or complete methylation of at least one promoter of at least one MGMT gene and/or are having an abnormal level of MGMT protein, especially an abnormal low level of MGMT protein. Accordingly, the invention provides medicaments and methods that can be advantageously used to treat patients associated with one or more of the aforementioned effects or defects.\n\n\nTherefore, subject of the instant invention is the use of a medicament as described herein and/or a method using said medicament for the treatment of patients, wherein the medicament is to be used in the treatment of patients having an increased DNA methylation status, patients showing partial or complete methylation of at least one promotor of at least one MGMT gene and or patients having an abnormal level of MGMT protein, especially an abnormal low level of MGMT protein. Such patients are preferably referred to as \"methylated patients\" .\n\n\nThese subjects are explained and discussed in more detail below.\n\n\nMethylation of the DNA-repair gene O\n6\n-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), more correctly called O\n6\n-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase repair gene or short MGMT repair gene, causes gene silencing. This epigenetic modification has been associated with a favourable prognosis in patients with many different cancer types, such as glioblastoma (GBM), who receive alkylating agents, for example, nitrogen mustards, ethyleneimine compounds, alkyl sulphonates and other compounds with an alkylating action, preferably selected from nitrosoureas, preferably ACNU, BCNU and CCNU, busulfan, melphalan, carboplatin, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, \n\n cyclophosphamide, dacarbazine, carmustine, ifosfamide and lomustine, temozolomide and altretamine, or campthothecin. Accordingly, there is a relationship between MGMT promoter methylation and the survival rate and sensitivity to alkylating agents, such as temozolomide. The MGMT enzyme removes alkyl groups from the 06 position of guanine, the site of a number of chemotherapy-induced DNA alkylations. These chemotherapy induced alkylations lead to DNA damage in the tumor cells, including DNA double strand breaks and mismatches, which trigger apoptosis and cytotoxicity [5,6]. The MGMT enzyme repairs DNA damage, thus interfering with the therapeutic effects of chemotherapy alkylating agents [7-10]. Methylation of discrete regions of the MGMT promoter CpG island is associated with silencing of the gene and diminished DNA-repair enzyme activity [11-13]. Previous studies have indicated that 30-40% of GBM patients have methylated MGMT promoter [1-4].\n\n\nThe MGMT promoter methylation and thus the methylation status of the MGMT can be advantageously determined using a 2-stage methylation specific PCR analysis on DNA extracted from tumor specimens, such as tumour specimens which have been snap frozen at surgery. The Methylation specific PCR analysis can be easily performed according to methods in the art. Preferably it can be performed by the Method by Hegi et al., NEJM, 2005, 352; 997-1003); the following method has been successfully been used in a Phase III trial assessing the methylation status of a subset of the patients (tissue available):\n\n\nDNA extraction and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction\n\n\nGenomic DNA is isolated from one or two paraffin sections of glioblastoma tissue (Ex-Wax DNA Extraction Kit S4530, Chemicon) (proteinase digestion lasted a maximum of six hours). DNA is denatured with sodium hydroxide in a volume of 35 μl and subjected to bisulfite treatment in a volume of 360 μl (4.4 M sodium bisulfite and 20 mM hydroquinone) for five hours at 55°C and \n\n then purified (Wizard DNA Clean-Up System A7280, Promega). Unmethylated cytosine, but not its methylated counterpart, is modified into uracil by the treatment. The methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is performed in a two-step approach. [Palmisano WA, Divine KK,\n\n\nSaccomanno G, et al. Predicting lung cancer by detecting aberrant promoter methylation in sputum. Cancer Res 2000;60:5954-8.] The results can be confirmed in an independent experiment, starting with reisolation of DNA from the tumor. The PCR products are separated on 4 percent agarose gels. The investigators who selected and analyzed the glioblastoma samples are blinded to all clinical information.\n\n\nAlternatively, it can be performed according to the method described by Donson et al. in Journal Pedriatic Blood Cancer, 2006.\n\n\nAccording to Donson et al., the MGMT promoter methylation/methylation status of the MGMT can be advantageously determined according to the following procedure:\n\n\nDNA Extraction and Methylation-Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction\n\n\nGenomic DNA is isolated from snap frozen tumor obtained at surgery (COMIRB 95-500) and GBM cell-lines using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA methylation patterns in the CpG island of the MGMT gene are determined by methylation specific PCR. This procedure involves chemical modification of unmethylated, but not methylated cytosines to uracil, followed by a nested, twostage PCR [17]. One microgram of DNA is denatured with sodium hydroxide (final cone. 0.3 M) in a volume of 55 ml and subjected to bisulfite treatment in a volume of 610 ml (3.3 M sodium bisulfite and O.δmMhydroquinone) for 16 hr at 558C and then purified using the Wizard DNA Clean-Up System (Promega, Madison, Wl). PCR is performed to amplify a 289-bp fragment of the MGMT gene including a portion of the CpG- rich promoter region. The primers recognize the bisulfite-modified template \n\n but do not discriminate between methylated and unmethylated alleles. Primer sequences used in the stage 1 amplification of theMGMTgene are as follows: MGMT-stage 1 -Forward, 50-GGATATGUGGGATAGTT- 30; and MGMT- stage 1 -Reverse, δO-CCAAAAACCCCAAACCC- 30. Master Mix (Fermentas,\n\n\nHanover, MD). The PCR amplification protocol for stage 1 is as follows: 958C for 10 min, then denature at 958C for 30 sec, anneal at 528C for 30 sec, extension at 728C for 30 sec for 40 cycles followed by a 10min final extension. A25-ml volume is used in all of the PCR reactions. The stage-1 PCR products are diluted 50-fold, and 5 ml of this dilution is subjected to a stage-2 PCR in which primers specific to methylated or unmethylated template are used. Primer sequences for the stage 2 PCR for the unmethylated reaction are MGMT-stage 2-Forward, 50- TTTGTGTTTTGATGTTTGTAGG I I I I I GT-30 and MGMT-stage 2-Reverse, δO-AACTCCACACTCTTCCAAAAACAAAACA- 30 and for the methylated reaction MGMT-stage 2-forward 50-TTTCGACGTTCGTAGGTTTTCGC- 30 and MGMT-stage 2-reverse 50-GCACTCTTCCGAAAACGAAACG- 30. The PCR amplification protocol for stage 2 is as follows: 958C for 10 min, then denature at 958C for 15 sec, anneal at 628C for 15 sec, extension at 728C for 15 sec for 40 cycles followed by a 10 min final 728C extension. DNA from normal human lymphocytes treated in vitro with Sssl methyltransferase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) is used as positive control for methylated alleles of MGMT and untreated DNA from normal lymphocytes is used as negative control for methylated alleles of MGMT. Each PCR reaction (10 ml) is directly loaded onto 4% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV illumination. Statistical Analysis can be performed with methods known in the art, such as the methods by Kaplan-Meier, correlation and statistical significance analyses, for example using the Prism statistical analysisprogram (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation status analysis is performed on snap frozen tissue of the patients. MGMT methylation status can regularly be determined out the tumors. In a part of the patients, the samples tested for MGMT promoter methylation status proved to be partially \n\n methylated (Fig. A). None of the samples showed complete methylation. The incomplete methylation observed may be due to tumor heterogeneity, infiltrating peripheral blood lymphocytes and/or vasculature. For comparison purposes, it can be determined whether partial methylation of the tumor MGMT promoter can be responsible for this observation by investigating the MGMT promoter methylation status of 6 GBM cell-lines, including cell-line 145 which is established from a patient who is treated with temozolomide and who's snap frozen tumor is also analyzed in the above study. In four out of the six celllines studied, partial methylation of promoter is observed (Fig. B). The results show that even in pure GBM cell-lines, partial MGMT promoter methylation can exist.

A 100-bp marker ladder is loaded to estimate molecular size, as shown on the left scale (L).\n\n\nThe MGMT analysis technique described above has been employed in the majority of recent studies showing MGMT methylation to be a successful predictor of response to alkylating agents [1-3]. This technique has superseded earlier techniques of enzyme activity measurement after it was demonstrated that MGMT methylation was the main cause of loss of MGMT enzymatic activity in GBM.\n\n\nPatients that are tested as patients showing MGMT methylation or that can be tested as patients showing MGMT methylation, preferably using the above described method, an analog method thereof, or any other method which is equally suitable according to the understanding of the ones skilled in the art, are to be regarded as \"methylated patients\" according to the invention, more preferably as patients having an increased DNA methylation status and/or as patients showing partial or complete methylation of at least one promotor of at least one MGMT gene. They thus belong to the collective of patients that can be especially advantageously treated by the methods of treatment or the medicaments according to the invention.\n\n\nHowever, such techniques, e.g. the method described below, can preferably be used in concordance with the instant invention with respect to the MGMT status. \n\n Chemotherapeutic efficacy, the ability of chemotherapy to eradicate tumor cells without causing lethal host toxicity, depends on drug selectivity. One class of anticancer drugs, alkylating agents, cause cell death by binding to DNA which structurally distorts the DNA helical structure preventing DNA transcription and translation. In normal cells, the damaging action of alkylating agents can be repaired by cellular DNA repair enzymes, in particular O\n6\n-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) also known as O\n6\n-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (AGAT). The level of MGMT varies in tumor cells, even among tumors of the same type. The gene encoding\n\n\nMGMT is not commonly mutated or deleted. Rather, low levels of MGMT in tumor cells are due to an epigenetic modification; the MGMT promoter region is methylated, thus inhibiting transcription of the MGMT gene and preventing expression of MGMT. Methylation has been shown by several lines of evidence to play a role in gene expression, cell differentiation, tumorigenesis, X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting and other major biological processes. In eukaryotic cells, methylation of cytosine residues that are immediately 5' to a guanosine, occurs predominantly in cytosine-guanine (CG) poor regions. In contrast, CpG islands remain unmethylated in normal cells, except during X- chromosome inactivation and parental specific imprinting where methylation of 5\n1\n regulatory regions can lead to transcriptional repression. Expression of a tumor suppressor gene can also be abolished by de novo DNA methylation of a normally unmethylated CpG. Hypermethylation of genes encoding DNA repair enzymes can serve as markers for predicting the clinical response to certain cancer treatments. Certain chemotherapeutic agents (including alkylating agents for example) inhibit cellular proliferation by cross-linking DNA\n1\n resulting in cell death. Treatment efforts with such agents can be thwarted and resistance to such agents develops because DNA repair enzymes remove the cross-linked structures. In view of the deleterious side effects of most chemotherapeutic drugs, and the ineffectiveness of certain drugs for various treatments, it is \n\n desirable to predict the clinical response to treatment with chemotherapeutic agents.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 6,773,897 discloses methods relating to chemotherapeutic treatment of a cell proliferative disorder. In particular, a method is provided for \"predicting the clinical response to certain types of chemotherapeutic agents\", including specific alkylating agents. The method entails determination and comparison of the methylation state of nucleic acid encoding a DNA repair enzyme from a patient in need of treatment with that of a subject not in need of treatment. Any difference is deemed \"predictive\" of response. The method, however, offers no suggestion of how to improve clinical outcome for any patient with an unfavorable \"prediction\". Temozolomide is an alkylating agent available from Schering Corp. under the trade name of Temodar® in the United States and Temodal® in Europe. Temodar® Capsules for oral administration contain temozolomide, an imidazotetrazine derivative. The chemical name of temozolomide is 3,4- dihydro-3-methyl-4-oxoimidazo[5,1-d]-as-tetrazine-8-carboxarnide (see U. S. Pat. No. 5,260,291 ). The cytotoxicity of temozolomide or metabolite of it, MTIC, is thought to be primarily due to alkylation of DNA. Alkylation (methylation) occurs mainly at the O\n6\n and N\n7\n positions of guanine.\n\n\nTemodar® (temozolomide) Capsules are currently indicated in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed gliobastoma multiforme as well as refractory anaplastic astrocytoma, i.e. patients at first relapse who have experienced disease progression on a drug regimen containing a nitrosourea and procarbazine. Temodal® is currently approved in Europe for the treatment of patients with malignant glioma, such as glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma showing recurrence or progression after standard therapy.\n\n\nAccording to the invention, alternatively to the method described above, the level of methylation of MGMT gene is assessed by determining the level of MGMT protein in a sample obtained from the patient. The level can be \n\n classified as being \"Very Low\" \"Low\", \"Moderate\", or \"High\", preferably as described in more detail below.\n\n\nAssessing whether or not the MGMT gene is methylated can be performed using any method known to one skilled in the art.

This assay entails initial modification of DNA by sodium bisulfite, converting all unmethylated, but not methylated, cytosines to uracil, and subsequent amplification with primers specific for methylated versus unmethylated DNA. MSP requires only small quantities of DNA, is sensitive to 0.1% methylated alleles of a given CpG island locus, and can be performed on DNA extracted from paraffin- embedded samples. MSP eliminates the false positive results inherent to previous PCR-based approaches which relied on differential restriction enzyme cleavage to distinguish methylated from unmethylated DNA. This \n\n method is very simple and can be used on small amounts of tissue or a few cells.\n\n\nAn illustrative example of a Western blot assay useful for this embodiment of the invention to measure the level of MGMT protein in patient samples is presented in U.S. Pat.

After 14 days, cilengitide (4 mg/kg) is given as an intraperitoneal bolus in PBS, at various time (8h, 4h, 2h, 1 h) prior to a single treatment with single, collimated, dorsal- ventral beam of 6 MV x-rays, so that 95-100% of the central axis dose of 25 Gy hit the tumor volume (Kim et al., 1999). Each of the 7 subsequent days the animals also received an identical i.p. bolus of cilengitide. The animals are maintained under ad libitum food and drink until they become moribund, or are sampled for tissue analysis (in the t-4 and t-8 h groups, where the animals are healthy past 230 days post tumor injection). A Kaplan-Meier survival curve is calculated and plotted (Fig.1 ) from the raw data (Table 1 ). All animals in the RT monotherapy group died by 120 d. \n\n Reference List:\n\n\nEngebraaten.O., Hjortland.G.O., Hirschberg.H., and Fodstad.O. (1999).

The primary endpoint was Progression Free Survival (PFS) at 6 months (mths). Secondary endpoints included response, survival, time to disease progression, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics.\n\n\n25\n\n\nResults: Actual accrual; 81 pts (median Karnofsky Performance Status 80%; median age 57 yrs) at 15 sites. 41 pts received 500 mg and 40 pts to receive 2000 mg of i.v. cilengitide 2x/week. No obvious imbalance in prognostic factors was observed. Median infusions;16 [range, 4-179]. Treatment related NCI CTC grade 3 adverse events (AEs) included elevated liver enzymes (at\n\n\nOU\n\n\n500 mg), arthralgia/ myalgia (at 500 mg), and weight increase/ edema (at 2000 mg) in 1 patient, respectively. No grade 4 therapy related AEs were reported by the investigators. One CTC grade 2 cerebral hemorrhage was \n\n reported, possibly related either to the drug or to the disease. The PFS rate at 6 mths was 16.1% (n=13/81 pts). 10 of these pts (12.3 %, n=4 with 500 mg, n=6 with 2000 mg) received 12 or more cycles of therapy (1 cycle=4 weeks). Six pts (7.4%) were still progression-free and on treatment at the time when this abstract was issued. In the 500 mg arm, median Overall Survival (mOS) was 6.5 mths [95% Cl: 5.2-9.3 mths], 12 mth overall survival (OS) rate was 24.4%. In the 2000 mg arm, mOS was 9.9 mths [95% Cl, 6.3- 15.7 mths], 12 mth OS rate was 37.5%. Although not statistically significant, there was a trend towards better tumor control in pts receiving 2000 mg 2x/week.\n\n\nConclusion: Cilengitide was tolerated well in single agent therapy at two dose levels. Cilengitide demonstrated advantagous single agent activity in recurrent glioblastoma, with long term disease stabilisation in a subset of pts.\n\n\nExample 3: Phase I/Ma Trial of Cilengitide (= cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe- NMe-VaI)) and Temozolomide with Concomitant Radiotherapy, Followed by Temozolomide and Cilengitide Maintenance Therapy in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma (GBM).\n\n\nPurpose: To evaluate safety, toxicity, and efficacy of the combination of the cyclic RGD pentapeptide Cilengitide (= cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val)), an inhibitor of integrins avβ3 and avβ5, in addition to standard temozolomide (TMZ) and radiotherapy (RT).\n\n\nPatients and methods: Fifty-two pts (PS 0-1 : 92%, 2: 8%; median age 57 yrs) after biopsy (n= 9/17%) or tumor resection (n=43/83% ) were treated with standard TMZ/RT (Stupp et al. NEJM 2005). In addition Cilengitide (500 mg i.v., 2x/week) was started one week before TMZ/RT and given throughout for the duration of chemotherapy or until progression. Primary endpoint was progression free survival rate at 6 months (target: 65%). Patients were followed with MRI every 2 months. Histopathologic diagnosis and MRI \n\n imaging were independently reviewed, MGMT promotor methylation status was assessed in 45 (86.5%) pts.\n\n\nResults: Forty-six pts (92%) completed RT, ≥ 90% of concomitant TMZ was received by 42 pts and cilengitide by 45 pts. 20 pts (3 ongoing) completed 6 cycles of maintenance TMZ and cilengitide. Observed haematological grade 3 and 4 toxicity was: lymphopenia (28/52, 53.8%), thrombocytopenia (7/52 pt. 13.4%) and neutropenia (5/52, 9.6%). Treatment related non-hematologic grade 3 toxicities were reported for n=3/52 (5.7%) patients: constitutional symptoms (asthenia, fatigue, anorexia, n=3); elevated liver function tests (n=1 ), deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (n=1 ). One patient with a history of sigmoid diverticulosis experienced sigmoid perforation (grade 2). In total, 34/52 (65.4% [95% Cl, 50.9-78.0%]) of the patients were progression free at 6 months. Pts with O\n6\n-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene-promotor methylation in the tumor were more likely to reach 6 months PFS endpoint. In total, 34/52 (65.4% [95% Cl, 50.9-78.0%]) of the pts were progression free at 6 months. A major contribution to the overall result was provided by a subgroup of patients (23/52 subjects, with methylated MGMT promoter, silencing the DNA repair enzyme MGMT), which showed a strong increase of the PFS-6 rate compared to historical control (91 % vs. 69%). The other major subgroup (22/52, unmethylated MGMT promotor) showed a less relevant difference to the historical control (40.9% vs. 40%), which is likely to be significantly improved by a higher dosing of Cilengitide in comparison to the subgroup with methylated MGMT promoter. Overall the study reached its primary endpoint (PFS-6 = 65.4%)\n\n\nConclusion: The study reached its primary endpoint. The combination of the integrin inhibitor RGD peptide Cilengitide and TMZ/RT was well tolerated, PFS at 6 months is very advantagous. MGMT gene promotor methylation provides for even better prognosis. The results are summarized in Figure 2. \n\n Example 4: Proliferation Assays 1 Materials and methods\n\n\n1.1 Test system (biological materials/animals) Carcinoma cell lines are grown in the following media:\n\n\nA549 -DMEM containing 10% FCS (heat -inactivated) plus 2 mM glutamine, HUVEC-DMEM containing 10% FCS (heat -inactivated) plus 2 mMglutamine and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. All media contains 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 ug/ml streptomycin. Cells are passaged at confluence by washing once in cation -free PBS followed by a 3 minute incubation in trypsin (0.5 ug/ml)/EDTA (0.2 ug/ml) solution in PBS at 37°C. Cells are recovered in medium, centrifuged and taken up in medium and counted.\n\n\n1.2 Chemicals and solutions\n\n\nAll cell culture reagents are from GIBCO/lnVitrogen with the exception of foetal calf serum which is purchased from BioWhittaker. Dulbecco's PBS with and without cations is from GIBCO/lnvitrogen Alamar Blue is from Serotech.\n\n\nPaclitaxel, vinblastin, and oxaliplatin are from Sigma. Cisplatin is purchased from Fluka. Gemcitabine is purchased from LGC Promochem, Heidelberg. Gefitnib from AstraZeneca and imatinib from Novartis are commercially available. Cilengitide by Merck KGaA. Bovine serum albimun is from VWR. The extracellular matrix components vitronectin and fibronectin are purified from human serum in house according to SOP 6456; fibrinogen according to SOP 6460. Rat tail collagen I is from Serva.

Goat anti-mouse IgG FITC conjugate is from Becton Dickson.\n\n\n1.3 Methods \n\n FACS Analysis\n\n\nCells are harvested with trypsin as described above. The required number of cells is taken up in PBS containing 0.9 mM CaCI2 and 0.5 mM MgCI2+ 0.5%\n\n\nBSA (= FACS Buffer)and aliquoted 1 x10e6 /tube. After centrifugation at 800 x g for 4 minutes, the cells are incubated 60 minutes on ice with anti-integrin antibodies at 10 ug/ml in FACS Buffer, 100 ul/tube. After washing to remove unbound antibody, the cells are incubated with goat anti-mouse FITC diluted 1 :25 in FACS Buffer. Cells are incubated 30 minutes on ice, washed to remove unbound antibody and a final cell suspension is made in FACS Buffer 500 ul/tube. Cells are analyzed on a FACScan and the mean intensity fluorescence (MIF) is normalized to the MIF of the negative control (no primary antibody). Attachment Assay\n\n\nAttachment to extracellular matrix proteins is performed as follows: Briefly, 2.5 x 10e4 cells/well in RPMI containing 0.5% BSA and 25 mM Hepes pH 7.4 attached to non-tissue culture treated 96-well plates coated with serially diluted vitronectin, fibronectin, fibrinogen and collagen I for 60 minutes at 37°C. After washing to remove unbound cells the relative cell number is determined by incubation with hexosaminidase substrate. The colormetric reaction is read at 405 nm in a Genios plate reader (SLT). Proliferation assay Non-tissue cultures treated 96 well plates are coated using 100 ul/well of a 2 ug/ml vitronectin solution in PBS incubated overnight at 4 \n0\nC. Cells are plated at 5x10e3 in 100 ul cell culture medium (as described above for each cell line). After 3 hours at 37°C serially diluted chemotherapeutic agents are added alone or in the presence of a constant EC50 concentration of alpha V integrin blocker at two-fold concentration in 100ul/well in cell culture medium. Plates are incubated for 72 hours, after which relative cell number is determined by the addition of 20ul/well Alamar Blue (Resazurin) (Nakayama etal. 1997). After 4 hours of incubation at 37°C relative fluorescent intensity is read in a Genios plate reader (SLT) at 535/590nm (excitation/emission). \n\n 1.4 Experimental design\n\n\nPoints are run in triplicate. Reagent blanks, containing media plus colormetric reagent without cells, are run on each plate. Blank values are subtracted from test values and are routinely 5-10 % of uninhibited control values.\n\n\nIn FACS analysis 15,000 events analyzed. Single cells are gated out from debris and aggregates and the live cells based on staining with propidium iodide. Markers are set on a negative control population stained with goat anti-mouse FITC alone (no primary antibody). Cells that fell to the right of the marker (higher intensity fluorescence) are considered positively stained.\n\n\nThe results are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively. Concentration on X-Axis) refers to the respective compound (oxaliplatin, cisplatin, vinblastine, paclitaxel, lressa (gefitinib) or gemcitabine). Y-Axis refers to the relative cell number.\n\n\nCilengitide concentration is constant (6nM for NSCLC (A549) and 0.2 nM for Endothelial Cells (HUVEC), respectively).\n\n\nExample 5: Effect of alpha-V integrin inhibitors in combination with vinorelbine on the proliferation of human carcinoma cells\n\n\nThe effect of integrin alpha V blocker EMD 121974 (Cilengitide) on the viability of human carcinoma cells were tested, in combination with vinorelbine and paclitaxel, respectively, in a cell viability assay, dependent on reduction of Alamar blue dye. Each agent alone could inhibiting carcinoma viability, used together the compounds show an advantagous and preferably synergistic inhibitory effect.\n\n\n5.1 Test System (Biological Materials/Animals)\n\n\n5.2 Chemicals and Solutions\n\n\nCilengitide, EMD 121974, cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe[N-Me]-Val) was synthesized, purified and characterized in house [23]. Cilengitide was stored in sterile apyrogenic solution at 4 \n0\nC. \n\n Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (136.9 mM NaCI, 2.8 mM KCI, 8.1 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n» H2O, 1.5 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n) without calcium and magnesium, trypsin /EDTA and Medium 199 were from Life Technologies, and other reagents as follows: serum albumin (bovine Fraction V) (VWR); Alamar Blue\n\n\n(Serotec); chemotherapeutic agents paclitaxel, docetaxel, etoposide, and vinorelbine are commercially available. Chemotherapeutic compounds were dissolved in DMSO as stock solutions at 10 mM, stored at 4°C and used within one month.\n\n\n5.3 Methods\n\n\nThe methods established and described in detail previously (Goodman and Hahn a; b) were used to measure the effect of combinations of integrin inhibitors and chemotherapeutics on carcinoma cell and human endothelial cell proliferation.\n\n\n5.4 Experimental Design\n\n\nPoints were run in duplicate or in triplicate. Reagent blanks, containing media plus Alamar Blue without cells, were run on each plate. Blank values were subtracted from test values and were routinely 5-10 % of uninhibited control values.\n\n\nIn the growth assay Cilengitide was tested in the range of 50 μM to 0.1 nM. In the Constant Ratio Combination Assay substances were tested at 8-fold, 4-fold, 2-fold 1-fold 0.5-fold and 0.25-fold of the respective EC\n50\n concentration.\n\n\n5.5 Methods of Evaluation and Statistics\n\n\nChemotherapeutic agents and αv-integrin blockers were serially diluted alone or together (combination therapy). In some assays the chemotherapeutic agent was serially diluted alone or in combination with of alpha-v integrin blocker. Growth inhibition curves were plotted and a shift of the combination therapy curve to lower concentrations in relation to the single agent curves \n\n was interpreted as an additional effect, produced by combination versus monotherapy.\n\n\n5.6 Results\n\n\nThe αv -integrin competitive inhibitor Cilengitide (EMD 121974) was tested alone and in combination with vinorelbine in a serum growth stimulation assay using human carcinoma cells or human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In these assays cells are cultured in serum, or in an endothelial growth stimulation medium (Goodman & Hahn).\n\n\nAs monotherapies, the chemotherapeutics inhibited the growth of both endothelial and carcinoma cells.\n\n\nThe alpha -v integrin blockers inhibited endothelial cell growth. A typical result using HUVEC is shown in Fig 1 , where the IC\n50\n for Cilengitide was 700 nM. For Paclitaxel the IC\n50\n of 10 nM was reduced to 0.05 nM in combination with 2 μM Cilengitide. For vinorelbine, the IC\n50\n of 20 nM was reduced to 0.8 nM in combination with 2 μM Cilengitide.\n\n\nGrowth of cancer cell lines derived from non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC: A549, renal carcinoma (A498), and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN: Detroit 562) were also inhibited by the chemotherapeutics, and specifically by vinorelbine, and in all cases this inhibition was advantagously and preferably synergistically enhanced by the presence of cilengitide.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of the vinorelbine with integrin inhibitors at their EC\n50\n concentrations lowered the EC\n50\n for these cytotoxics dramatically, preferably at least 5-fold, more preferably at least 10-fold, or even more. As the therapeutic window for such drugs is often extremely narrow, this reduction in EC\n50\n appears to be a very valuable addition to the anti-cancer drug battery allowing more prolonged and less aggressive, yet more efficacious therapy regimens to be pursued.

Cilengitide concentration is 2μM (constant).\n\n\nExample 7: Effect of αv integrin ligand Cilengitide in combination with docetaxel/paclitaxel on HUVEC cell proliferation\n\n\nConstant ratio assay with docetaxel/paclitaxel and Cilengitide combinations on HUVEC endothelial cells grown in complete EGM MV medium, analysis \n\n according to Chou and Talalay [1] shows synergistic effect in Figure 7 graph and isobologram. The respective Combination Index (Cl) Docetaxel - Cilengitide (Cl = 0.7) and Paclitaxel - Cilengitide (Cl = 0.1 ) indicates the synergistic effect of the combinations.\n\n\nExample 8: Effect of αv integrin ligand Cilengitide in combination with paclitaxel on NSCLC cell proliferation\n\n\nFigure 8 shows A549 Constant Ratio Proliferation Assay. Cells grew on vitronectin-coated plates for 72 hours in the presence of a serially diluted chemotherapeutic with (triangles) or without (squares) Cilengitide. For the combination treatment the drugs were mixed at eight-fold the respective EC\n50\n concentrations and the mixture was a serially diluted. Relative cell number was determined by Alamar Blue reduction and shows the synergistic effect of the combination of paclitaxel and Cilengitide on the cell grow. The respective Combination Index (Cl) Paclitaxel - Cilengitide (Cl = 0.33) indicates the synergistic effect of the combination.\n\n\nExample 9: Effect of αv integrin ligand Cilengitide in combination with bleomycin/oxaliplatin/paclitaxel on A549 NSCLC cell proliferation\n\n\nA549 NSCLC assay with bleomycin/oxaliplatin/paclitaxel and Cilengitide ananlysed according to Chou and Talalay [1] shows synergistic effect in all graphs shown in Figure 9. The respective Combination Index (Cl) Bleomycin - Cilengitide (Cl = 0.07), Oxaliplatin - Cilengitide (Cl = 0.66) and Paclitaxel - Cilengitide (Cl = 0.33) indicates the synergistic effect of the combinations.\n\n\nExample 10: Effect of αv integrin ligand Cilengitide in combination with Paxlitaxel or Vinblastine on various NSCLC cell lines\n\n\nCalu6 NSCLC assay with paclitaxel and Cilengitide and H460 NSCLC assay with vinblastine/paclitaxel and Cilengitide show synergistic effects in all graphs shown in Figure 10. \n\n Example 11: Effect of αv integrin ligand Cilengitide in combination with 5-FU or Paclitaxel on various EGFR dependent cell lines\n\n\nBoth the combinations of 5-FU with Cilengitide and Paclitaxel with Cilengitide show an advantagous and preferably synergistic effect in EGFR dependent cancers, as is shown by the results in Figure 11 , e.g. in the ACHN, A498 and Caki 1 cell proliferation assays.\n\n\nExample 12: Combination efficacy of Cilengitide & Erbitux in carcinoma xenograft, optionally in combination with Radiotherapy\n\n\nThis example shows that combined treatment with integrin ligand Cilengitide, a potent antagonist of αvβ3, and EGFR antibody Cetuximab (Erbitux), optionally combined with Radiotherapy (preferably also referred to as RT, Rx or RTx), preferably external beam radiotherapy, are beneficial, and especially synergistically beneficial, in local tumor therapy. The results of the in vivo xenograft experiments show that radiation up-regulates αvβ3 expression in endothelial cells and consecutively phosphorylates Akt, whichmay provide a tumor escape mechanism from radiation injury mediated by integrin survival signaling. The studies on endothelial cell proliferation, migration, tube formation, apoptosis, and clonogenic survival also show that the radiosensitivity of endothelial cells is enhanced by the concurrent administration of the integrin antagonist. It can be shown that promissing in vitro data (shown in Figure 14) can be successfully translated into human xenograft modells, e.g. the epidermoid (A431 ), xenograft model growing s.c. on BALB/c-nu/nu mice as shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13. Suitable reagents and methods for these experiments are known in the art.\n\n\nThe experiments are preferably carried out as described below or in an analogous manner thereof:\n\n\nReagents and cell culture. Primary isolated HUVECs and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC; Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany) are cultured up to passage 5. Cells are maintained in culture at 37jC with 5% \n\n CO2 and 95% humidity in serum reduced (5% FCS) modified Promocell medium supplemented with 2 ng/mL VEGF and 4 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; refs. 1 , 30, 31). Human prostate (PC3), glioma (U87), and vulva (A431 ) tumor cells (Tumorbank DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany) are cultured in DMEM medium (10% FCS). All experiments are carried out with HUVEC (up to passage 5) and a selection of experiments is confirmed using HDMEC (up to passage 6).\n\n\nMatrigel invasion, migration, and coculture experiments. Invasion of HUVEC and HDMEC in vitro is measured on Matrigel-coated (0.78 mg/mL) transwell inserts with 8 Am pore size (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells are trypsinized and 200 AL of cell suspension (3 _ 105 cells/mL) per experiment are added to transwells in triplicate. Chemoattractant medium containing VEGF and bFGF (500 AL) is added to the lower wells. For coculture studies, PC3 cells are seeded in 24-well plates and, after irradiation of PC3 cells, Matrigel-coated transwells with endothelial cells are added to the upper compartment. After 18 hours of incubation, endothelial cells that have invaded the underside of the membrane are fixed and stained with Diff- Quik Il solution (Dade Behring) and sealed on slides. Migrating cells are counted by microscopy.\n\n\nAnimal studies. Animal studies are done according to the rules for care and use of experimental animals and approved by the local and governmental Animal Care Committee instituted by the German government\n\n\n(Regierungspraesidium, Karlsruhe). For tumor growth experiments with s.c. growing human xenotransplants, athymic 8-week-old, 20 g BALB/c-nu/nu mice are obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany). Human PC3 prostate carcinoma cells, U87 glioblastoma cells, and A431 vulva carcinoma cells are injected s.c. into the right hind limb (1-5 _ 106 cells in 100 AL PBS). Animals are randomized for therapy when tumor volume reaches 200 mm\n3\n as determined thrice weekly by direct measurement with calipers and calculated by the formula volume V = length _ width _ width _ \n\n 0.5. Starting on day O, the respective drug is administered s.c. as given below. Radiotherapy (5 _ 2.5 Gy) is delivered on 5 consecutive days using a Co-60 source (Siemens, Gammatron, Erlangen, Germany), or as given below.\n\n\nCombination efficacy of Cilengitide & Erbitux in carcinoma xenograft, optionally in combination with Radiotherapy (Rx) is preferably determined as follows: A431 human epidermoid carcinoma s.c. on balb c nu nu mouse is treated with Erbitux (cetuximab) in an amount of 25 mg/kg (=0.5mg/animal), administered i.p. on day 1 (4h before radiotherapy (Rx), if the optional radiotherapy is also applied), day 8, day 15 and day 22; Cilengitide (cyclo- (Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-NMe-Val)) is administered i.p. in an amount of:25 mg/kg 20 times, preferably on 5 consecutive days per week (2Ox 5/w), preferably 1 - 2 h before radiotherapy (Rx), if the optional radiotherapy is also applied.\n\n\nFurther reference, especially with respect to the methodology, is given to the Literature given below, which is included in the disclosure of this application in its entirety by reference:\n\n\nAbdollahi et al. , CANCER RESEARCH 63, 8890-8898, December 15, 2003 Abdollahi et al. , Cancer Res 2005; 65: (9).

These results are shown in Figure 14.\n\n\nCell proliferation assays were run with A431 , HDMVEC and U87 cell lines, \n\n respectively, with either Erbitux (at a concentration of 2.2 μg/ml) or Cilengitide (at a concentration of 100 nM) or both, optionally in combination with radiotherapy (Rx = 2 Gy), against the untreated control or radiotherapy Rx alone. Figure 14 shows the advantageous and preferably synergistic effect of all the combinations and especially of the combination of Erbitux and Cilengitide and the combination of Erbitux, Cilengitide and radiotherapy.\n\n\nExample 15: Effect of αv integrin ligand Cilengitide and etoposide on HUVEC cell proliferation.

Relative cell number was determined by Alamar Blue reduction.\n\n\nAs is shown by the isobologram in Figure 15, αv integrin ligand Cilengitide and etoposide act synergistically to inhibit HUVEC endothelial cell proliferation. The data for the eye isobologram is taken from the graph on top of Figure 15 and is analysed according to Chou and Talalay [1]. Dm = drug concentration at medium effect.

These results are shown in Figure 19.\n\n\nConstant Ratio Proliferation Assay: DMS 53 SCLC cells were cultured 72 hr in the presence of etoposide or cisplatin alone or in combination with Cilengitide at a fixed ratio. Cell number was determined by Alamar Blue _,_ reduction.\n\n\nX-axis shows the concentration of chemotherapeutic agent used. The Cilengitide concentration was in a ratio of 0.4:1 for etoposide:Cilengitide and 1:0.5 for cisplatin.Cilengitide.\n\n\nExample 20: A phase I study of continuous infusion EMD 121974 (EMD), an antiangiogenic avB3 and avB5 integrin antagonist, in patients with advanced solid malignancy. \n\n Background: lntegrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 are cell-surface receptors that play a significant role in angiogenesis by mediating the ligation signal that allows endothelial cells to attach to the extracellular matrix. These integrins share the binding epitope Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD). EMD is an RGD-containing cyclic pentapeptide. In clinical studies to date, EMD has been administered in an intermittent fashion. However, EMD has a short half-life of 3-5 hours with no evidence of drug accumulation. These data prompted the initiation of this phase I study of continuous infusion EMD. Methods: EMD was administered as a continuous infusion without break in 4-week cycles. Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic studies were obtained weekly in cycle 1 immediately prior to and 2 hours after infusion bag change. Results: To date 21 patients (15 male/6 female, median age 56, median Karnofsky performance status 90%) have been treated at the following dose levels: 1 , 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 27 mg/h. Hematologic toxicities have been limited to grade 2 anemia and grade 3 lymphopenia. Non-hematologic toxicities have been limited to grade < 2 and include alopecia, anorexia, diarrhea, fatigue, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypophosphatemia, insomnia, mucositis, nail changes, nausea, and transaminase elevation. One patient treated at 27 m/h experienced an unobserved death of unknown cause after two weeks of therapy. Pharmacokinetic analysis has been completed for patients treated at the 12 mg/h dose level and below. Mean values for half-life, clearance, and volume of distribution were comparable across dose levels, and steady-state concentration increased proportionally to dose. Conclusions: EMD can be safely administered as a continuous infusion at doses of up to at least 18 mg/h. No single toxicity has been consistently observed. A patient death in cycle 1 has resulted in the expansion of the 27 mg/h dose level. .\n\n\nExample 21...: Continuous Infusion Study Pharmacokinetic Report Study Design :\n\n\nPatients with solid tiunors received a continuous infusion of line/h. 2 mε/h, 4 uig/h, 8 uig/h or 12 mg/h. with a weekly change of infusion bag. \n\n Plasma Sampling:\n\n\nBlood samples were taken on Day 1 (fust dose) at pre-dose and 2 h after start of infiision and then weekly just before change of infusion bag and 2 hours thereafter for the fust 4 weeks. 5\n\n\nPharmacokinetic Analysis\n\n\nThe following pharmacokinetic parameters were derived at Merck KGaA Darmstadt, Germany, by mathematical methods using Kinetica Version 4.1.1.\n\n\nCL the total body clearance of EMD 121974 from plasma Λ p.

Assuming a half-life of 4 horns (see IB. \\\nla\n is 3 to 5 hours) steady state conditions should be ieached within 24 horns\n\n\nFrom C\n55\n and f\nI/2\n the PK paramefeis CL. k\ne\n and V were calculated as follows: CL = Rate / C\n55\n \n\n\nk. = ln(2) / t\nlo\n \n\n\nV = CL / k\ne\n \n\n Tlie calculated pharmacokinetic parameters are given in Table 4 - 2. Mean vohune of distribution ranged from 33 to 48 L (i.e. 18.3 to 26.6 L/sqm assuming a BSA of 1.8 sqm). mean clearance ranged from 5.72 to 8.31 L/h (i.e. 3.2 to 4.6 L/li/sqm). Whereas clearance is in general agreement with previous studies, vohune of distribution seems to be slightly higher in this study than experienced before. This may be due to the fact that the 5 calculation based on an assumed population half-life of 4 hours. With smaller values for\n\n\n\\\nm\n (e.g. 3 hours) the calculated vohune of distribution would have been somewhat lower.\n\n\nThe derived PK parameters were used for simulation of concentration data. The individual simulated concentration-tinie profiles per treatment are given in Figure 5 - 2, and mean concentration- time profiles are given in Figure 4 - 3. The individual simulated concentrations are plotted with the measured concentrations in Figure 5 - 3.\n\n\n-| Q For evaluating dose proportionality the steady state concentrations C\na\n were divided by rate and presented for each treatment group. C^ seems to increase proportional to dose.\n\n\nIndividual PK Parameters and Descriptive Statistics\n\n\n15\n\n\n20\n\n\n25\n\n\n0 \n\n Calculated PK parameters of I ΞMD 121974 for t\n1/2\n = 4 hours\n\n\nRate Subject c« CL K V (mg/h) (ng/mL) (Uh) M/h) (L)\n\n\n1 1 2603 384 0173 222\n\n\n2 Θ84 1017 0173 587\n\n\n3 915 1093 0173 631\n\n\nN 3 3 3 3\n\n\nMean 1500 831 0173 480\n\n\nStdev 955 389 0000 224\n\n\nMm 915 384 0173 222\n\n\nMax 2603 1093 0173 631\n\n\n%CV 637 468 00 468\n\n\n2 4 2903 689 0173 398\n\n\n5 4402 454 0173 262\n\n\nN 2 2 2 2\n\n\nMean 3653 572 0173 330\n\n\nStdev 1059 166 0000 96\n\n\nMin 2903 454 0173 262\n\n\nMax 4402 689 0173 398\n\n\n%CV 290 290 00 290\n\n\n4 6 6208 644 0173 372\n\n\n7 5326 751 0173 433\n\n\n8 6713 596 0173 344\n\n\n9 6467 619 0173 357\n\n\nN 4 4 4 4\n\n\nMean 6178 652 0173 377\n\n\nStdev 604 069 0000 40\n\n\nMin 5326 596 0173 344\n\n\nMax 6713 751 0173 433\n\n\n \n0\nACV 98 105 00 105\n\n\n8 10 13430 596 0173 344\n\n\n11 8332 960 0173 554\n\n\n12 17720 451 0173 261\n\n\nN 3 3 3 3\n\n\nMean 13161 669 0173 386\n\n\nStdev 4700 262 0000 151\n\n\nMin 8332 451 0173 261\n\n\nMax 17720 960 0173 554\n\n\n%CV 357 392 00 392\n\n\n12 13 19562 613 0173 354\n\n\n14 15665 766 0173 442\n\n\n15 17767 675 0173 390\n\n\nN 3 3 3 3\n\n\nMean 17664 685 0173 395\n\n\nStdev 1950 077 0000 44\n\n\nMin 15665 613 0173 354\n\n\nMax 19562 766 0173 442\n\n\n%CV 110 112 00 112\n\n\nMean (SD) Dose Normalized Steady State Concentrations\n\n\nSee figure 20."
