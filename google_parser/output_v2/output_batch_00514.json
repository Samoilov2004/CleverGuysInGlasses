The present invention also relates to pegylated proteins comprising a disintegrin variant having an RGD motif variant \n48\nARLDDL\n53\n. The invention also relates to the use of the polypeptides of the invention for the treatment and prevention of αvβ3 integrin-associated diseases.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nBone is a complex tissue composed of several cell types which are continuously undergoing a process of renewal and repair termed “bone remodeling.” The two major cell types responsible for bone remodeling are osteoclasts, which resorb bone, and osteoblasts, which form new bone. Bone remodeling has been known to be regulated by several systemic hormones (e.g., parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D\n3\n, sex hormones, and calcitonin) and local factors (e.g., nitric oxide, prostaglandins, growth factors, and cytokines).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntegrins are heterodimeric matrix receptors that anchor cells to substrates and transmit externally derived signals across the plasma membrane. Integrin αvβ3 is involved in the osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, both in vivo and in vitro. This heterodimer molecule recognizes the amino acid motif Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) contained in bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein. Integrin αvβ3 is expressed in an osteoclast and its expression is modulated by resorptive steroids and cytokines. Based on blocking experiments, αvβ3 integrin has been identified as a major functional adhesion receptor on osteoclasts. Inhibitors of integrin αvβ3 reduce the capacity of osteoclasts to bind to and resorb bone. Integrin αvβ3 plays a major role in the function of osteoclasts and inhibitors of this integrin are being considered for treating or preventing osteoporosis, osteolytic metastases, and malignancy-induced hypercalcemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are many bone diseases that are related to osteolysis that is mediated by osteoclasts. Osteoporosis is the most common one that is induced when resorption and formation of bone are not coordinated and bone breakdown overrides bone building. Osteoporosis is also caused by other conditions, such as hormonal imbalance, diseases, or medications (e.g., corticosteroids or anti-epileptic agents). Bone is one of the most common sites of metastasis by human breast, prostate, lung and thyroid cancers, as well as other cancers. Osteoporosis may also result from post-menopausal estrogen deficiency. Secondary osteoporosis may be associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Bone metastasis shows a very unique step of osteoclastic bone resorption that is not seen in metastasis of other organs. It is widely accepted that osteolysis that is associated with cancer is essentially mediated by osteoclasts, which seem to be activated and may be indirectly activated through osteoblasts or directly by tumor products. In addition, hypercalcemia (increased blood-calcium concentration) is an important complication of osteolytic bone diseases. It occurs relatively frequently in patients with extensive bone destruction, and is particularly common in breast, lung, renal, ovarian and pancreatic carcinomas and in myeloma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisintegrins are a family of low-molecular-weight RGD-containing peptides that bind specifically to integrins αIIbβ3, α5β1 and αvβ3 expressed on platelets and other cells including vascular endothelial cells and some tumor cells. In addition to their potent antiplatelet activity, studies of disintegrins have revealed new uses in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases and the design of therapeutic agents in arterial thrombosis, osteoporosis and angiogenesis-related tumor growth and metastasis. Rhodostomin (Rho), a disintegrin derived from the venom of \nColloselasma rhodostoma, \nhas been found to inhibit platelet aggregation in vivo and in vitro through the blockade of platelet glycoprotein αIIbβ3. Furthermore, rhodostomin is reported to inhibit the adhesion of breast and prostate carcinoma cells to both unmineralized and mineralized bone extracellular matrices in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting the viability of tumor cells. In addition, rhodostomin inhibits the migration and invasion of breast and prostate carcinoma cells. Rhodostomin has also been shown to inhibit adipogenesis and obesity. However, because rhodostomin non-specifically binds to integrins αIIbβ3, α5β1 and αvβ3, the pharmaceutical uses of rhodostomin may cause serious side effects. For example, when applying rhodostomin in treating carcinomas, the inhibition of platelet aggregation is an undesirable side effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe role of αvβ3 integrin in bone diseases has been well documented. See, for example, F. Patrick Ross et al, \nNothing but skin and bone, \nthe Journal of Clinical Investigation, Vol. 116, #5, May 2006; S.B. Rodan et al, \nIntegrin function in osteoclasts, \nJournal of Endocrinology (1997) 154, S47-S56; Steven L. Teitelbaum, \nEditorial: Osteoporosis and Integrins, \nthe Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, April 2005, 90(4): 2466-2468; Steven L. Teitelbaum, \nOsteoclasts, integrins, and osteoporosis, \nJournal of Bone and Mineral Metabolism, (2000) 18: 344-349; Ichiro Nakamura et al, \nInvolvement of αvβ\n3 \nintegrins in osteoclast function, \nJournal of Bone and Mineral Metabolism, (2007) 25: 337-344; Le T.

These polypeptides will be potentially suitable to treat diseases and conditions involving αvβ3 integrin, including but not limited to various bone diseases, cancer, and diseases involving angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt would also be advantageous to create pegylated polypeptides selective for αvβ3 integrin to prolong the duration and decrease the antigenicity of a protein drug.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the invention, one aspect of the invention is a polypeptide that is selective for αvβ3 integrin.

Numerical quantities given are approximate, meaning that the term “around,” “about” or “approximately” can be inferred if not expressly stated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “polynucleotide,” “nucleotide,” “nucleic acid,” “nucleic acid molecule,” “nucleic acid sequence,” “polynucleotide sequence,” and “nucleotide sequence” are used interchangeably to refer to polymeric forms of nucleotides of any length. The polynucleotides can comprise deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, and/or their analogs or derivatives. The term includes variants. Variants may include insertions, additions, deletions, or substitutions. Nucleotide sequences are listed in the 5′ to 3′ direction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “polypeptide,” “peptide,” and “protein,” are used interchangeably to refer to a polymeric form of amino acids of any length, which can include naturally-occurring amino acids, coded and non-coded amino acids, chemically or biochemically modified, derivatized, or designer amino acids, amino acid analogs, peptidomimetics, and depsipeptides, and polypeptides having modified, cyclic, bicyclic, depsicyclic, or depsibicyclic peptide backbones. The term includes single chain protein as well as multimers. The term also includes proteins conjugated to a label such as FITC, biotin, and radioisotopes, including, but not limited to \n64\nCu, \n67\nCu, \n90\nY, 99mTc, 111In, \n124\nI, \n125\nI, \n131\nI, \n137\nCs, \n186\nRe, \n211\nAt, \n212\nBi, \n213\nBi, \n223\nRa, \n241\nAm, and \n244\nCm; enzymes having detectable products (for example, luciferase, peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, and the like); fluorescers and fluorescent labels, fluorescence emitting metals, for example, \n152\nEu, or others of the lanthanide series, electrochemiluniescent compounds, chemiluminescent compounds, for example, luminol, isoluminol, or acridinium salts; specific binding molecules, for example, magnetic particles, microspheres, nanospheres, and the like.

Such fusion proteins also include fusions to epitopes. Such fusion proteins can comprise multimers of the peptides of the invention, e.g. homodimers or homomultimers, and heterodimers and heteromultimers. The term also includes peptide aptamers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “hybridizes specifically,” in the context of a polynucleotide, refers to hybridization under stringent conditions. Conditions that increase stringency of both DNA/DNA and DNA/RNA hybridization reactions are widely known and published in the art. Examples of stringent hybridization conditions include hybridization in 4× sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), at about 65-70° C., or hybridization in 4×SSC plus 50% formamide at about 42-50° C., followed by one or more washes in 1× SSC, at about 65-70° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “ligand” refers to a molecule that binds to another molecule, including a receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “host cell” is an individual cell or cell culture which can be or has been a recipient of any recombinant vector(s) or polynucleotide. Host cells include progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily be completely identical (in morphology or in total DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation and/or change. A host cell includes cells transfected or infected in vivo or in vitro with a recombinant vector or a polynucleotide of the invention. A host cell which comprises a recombinant vector of the invention may be called a “recombinant host cell.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Treatment,” covers any administration or application of remedies for disease in a mammal, including a human, and includes inhibiting the disease, arresting its development, or relieving the disease, for example, by causing regression, or restoring or repairing a lost, missing, or defective function; or stimulating an inefficient process. The term includes obtaining a desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect, covering any treatment of a pathological condition or disorder in a mammal, including a human. The effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing a disorder or symptom thereof and/or may be therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure for a disorder and/or adverse affect attributable to the disorder. Thus, the invention provides both treatment and prophylaxis. It includes (1) preventing the disorder from occurring or recurring in a subject who may be predisposed to the disorder but is not yet symptomatic, (2) inhibiting the disorder, such as arresting its development, (3) stopping or terminating the disorder or at least its associated symptoms, so that the host no longer suffers from the disorder or its symptoms, such as causing regression of the disorder or its symptoms, for example, by restoring or repairing a lost, missing or defective function, or stimulating an inefficient process, or (4) relieving, alleviating, or ameliorating the disorder, or symptoms associated therewith, where ameliorating is used in a broad sense to refer to at least a reduction in the magnitude of a parameter, such as inflammation, pain, and/or tumor size.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “cancer associated with a highly expressed osteopontin (OPN)” refers to a cancer wherein the expression level of OPN is higher than the expression level of OPN in peripheral normal tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a non-toxic solid, semisolid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material, formulation auxiliary, or excipient of any conventional type. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and is compatible with other ingredients of the formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “composition” refers to a mixture that usually contains a carrier, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient that is conventional in the art and which is suitable for administration into a subject for therapeutic, diagnostic, or prophylactic purposes. It may include a cell culture in which the polypeptide or polynucleotide is present in the cells or in the culture medium. For example, compositions for oral administration can form solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, sustained release formulations, oral rinses, or powders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Disease” refers to any condition, infection, disorder, or syndrome that requires medical intervention or for which medical intervention is desirable. Such medical intervention can include treatment, diagnosis, and/or prevention.\n\n\n \nPeptides\n\n\n \n \n \nThe peptides of the invention can be expressed using methods known in the art. Cell-based methods and cell-free methods are suitable for producing peptides of the invention. Cell-based methods generally involve introducing a nucleic acid construct into a host cell in vitro and culturing the host cell under conditions suitable for expression, then harvesting the peptide, either from the culture medium or from the host cell, (for example, by disrupting the host cell), or both. The invention also provides methods of producing a peptide using cell-free in vitro transcription/translation methods, which are well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable host cells include prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells, including, for example, bacterial, yeast, fungal, plant, insect, and mammalian cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, a heterologous peptide, whether modified or unmodified, may be expressed on its own, as described above, or as a fusion protein, and may include not only secretion signals, but also a secretory leader sequence. A secretory leader sequence of the invention may direct certain proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The ER separates the membrane-bound proteins from other proteins. Once localized to the ER, proteins can be further directed to the Golgi apparatus for distribution to vesicles, including secretory vesicles, the plasma membrane, lysosomes, and other organelles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, peptide moieties and/or purification tags may be added to the peptides. Such regions may be removed prior to final preparation of the polypeptide. The addition of peptide moieties to polypeptides to engender secretion or excretion, to improve stability, and to facilitate purification, among other reasons, are familiar and routine techniques in the art. Suitable purification tags include, for example, V5, polyhistidines, avidin, and biotin. Conjugation of peptides to compounds such as biotin can be accomplished using techniques well known in the art. (Hermanson ed. (1996) Bioconjugate Techniques; Academic Press). Peptides can also be conjugated with radioisotopes, toxins, enzymes, fluorescent labels, colloidal gold, nucleic acids, vinorelbine, and doxorubicin using techniques known in the art. (Hermanson ed. (1996) Bioconjugate Techniques; Academic Press; Stefano et al. (2006).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion partners suitable for use in the invention include, for example, fetuin, human serum albumin, Fc, and/or one or more of their fragments. Conjugated proteins, such as polyethylene glycol conjugates, are also provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptides of the invention can also be chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art (e.g., see Hunkapiller et al., Nature, 310:105 111 (1984); Grant ed. (1992) Synthetic Peptides, A Users Guide, W.H. Freeman and Co.; U.S. Pat. No. 6,974,884)). For example, a polypeptide corresponding to a fragment of a polypeptide can be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer or through the use of solid-phase methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, if desired, nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the polypeptide sequence. Non-classical amino acids include, but are not limited to, to the D-isomers of the common amino acids, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, a-amino isobutyric acid, 4-aminobutyric acid, Abu, 2-amino butyric acid, g-Abu, e-Ahx, 6-amino hexanoic acid, Aib, 2-amino isobutyric acid, 3-amino propionic acid, ornithine, norleucine, norvaline, hydroxyproline, sarcosine, citrulline, homocitrulline, cysteic acid, t-butylglycine, t-butylalanine, phenylglycine, cyclohexylalanine, b-alanine, fluoro-amino acids, designer amino acids such as b-methyl amino acids, Ca-methyl amino acids, Na-methyl amino acids, and amino acid analogs in general. Furthermore, the amino acid can be D (dextrorotary) or L (levo rotary).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptides of the invention can be recovered and purified from chemical synthesis and recombinant cell cultures by standard methods which include, but are not limited to, ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. In one embodiment, high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”) is employed for purification. Well known techniques for refolding protein may be employed to regenerate active conformation when the polypeptide is denatured during isolation and/or purification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA peptide or peptidomimetic of the invention can be modified with or covalently coupled to one or more of a variety of hydrophilic polymers to increase solubility and circulation half-life of the peptide. Suitable nonproteinaceous hydrophilic polymers for coupling to a peptide include, but are not limited to, polyalkylethers as exemplified by polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polyoxyalkenes, polyvinylalcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose and cellulose derivatives, dextran, and dextran derivatives. Generally, such hydrophilic polymers have an average molecular weight ranging from about 500 to about 100,000 daltons, from about 2,000 to about 40,000 daltons, or from about 5,000 to about 20,000 daltons. The peptide can be derivatized with or coupled to such polymers using any of the methods set forth in Zallipsky, S. (1995) Bioconjugate Chem., 6:150-165; Monfardini, C., et al. (1995) Bioconjugate Chem. 6:62-69; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,640,835; 4,496,689; 4,301,144; 4,670,417; 4,791,192; 4,179,337, or WO 95/34326.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a peptide of the invention is provided in formulation with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, and diluents, of which a wide variety are known in the art. These pharmaceutical carriers, excipients, and diluents include those listed in the USP pharmaceutical excipients listing. USP and NF Excipients, Listed by Categories, p. 2404-2406, \nUSP\n 24 NF 19, United States Pharmacopeial Convention Inc., Rockville, Md. (ISBN 1-889788-03-1). Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as vehicles, adjuvants, carriers, or diluents, are readily available to the public. Moreover, pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, stabilizers, wetting agents and the like, are readily available to the public.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable carriers include, but are not limited to, water, dextrose, glycerol, saline, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The carrier can contain additional agents such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, or adjuvants which enhance the effectiveness of the formulation. Topical carriers include liquid petroleum, isopropyl palmitate, polyethylene glycol, ethanol (95%), polyoxyethylene monolaurate (5%) in water, or sodium lauryl sulfate (5%) in water. Other materials such as anti-oxidants, humectants, viscosity stabilizers, and similar agents can be added as necessary. Percutaneous penetration enhancers such as Azone can also be included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn pharmaceutical dosage forms, the compositions of the invention can be administered in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or they can also be used alone or in appropriate association, as well as in combination, with other pharmaceutically active compounds. The subject compositions are formulated in accordance to the mode of potential administration.\n\n\n \nMethods of Treatment\n\n\n \n \n \nAn αvβ3 integrin-associated disease, includes, but is not limited to, osteoporosis, cancer, bone tumor or cancer growth and symptoms related thereto, angiogenesis-related tumor growth and metastasis, tumor metastasis in bone, malignancy-induced hypercalcemia, angiogenesis-related eye diseases, Paget's disease, rheumatic arthritis and osteoarthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides of the invention may be administered to a subject in need of treatment by systemic injection, such as by intravenous injection; or by injection or application to the relevant site, such as by direct injection, or direct application to the site when the site is exposed in surgery; or by topical application, such as if the disorder is on the skin, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides of the invention can be used as monotherapy. Alternatively, the peptides of the invention can be used in combination with standard regimens to treat αvβ3 integrin associated diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the peptides of the invention can be used in a combinational therapy with a therapeutically effective amount of one or more other pharmaceutical agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, another pharmaceutical agent is selected from the group consisting of an anti-cancer agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, an immune-modulating agent and an anti-osteoporosis agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, an anti-cancer agent is selected from the group consisting of an anti-angiogenic agent, a cytotoxic agent and an anti-neoplastic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe other pharmaceutical agent(s) can be administered prior to, together with, or after administration of the peptides of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the combinational therapy with other pharmaceutical agents provides synergistic effects, including but not limited to enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of the other agents; allowing using lower doses of the other agents, thereby decreasing their side effects and reducing resistance to the other agents; and lowering the likelihood and/or the rate of cancer recurrence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the polypeptides of the invention are particularly effective against cancers which are associated with a highly expressed osteopontin. In preferred embodiments, the polypeptides of the invention can inhibit osteopontin-induced tumor invasion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the agents can be achieved in various ways, including oral, buccal, nasal, rectal, parenteral, intraperitoneal, intradermal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intra-arterial, intracardiac, intraventricular, intracranial, intratracheal, and intrathecal administration, etc., or otherwise by implantation or inhalation. Thus, the subject compositions can be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, liquid, or gaseous forms, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granules, ointments, solutions, suppositories, injections, inhalants and aerosols. The following methods and excipients are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable excipient vehicles are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, or the like, and combinations thereof. In addition, if desired, the vehicle can contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in the art. The composition or formulation to be administered will, in any event, contain a quantity of the agent adequate to achieve the desired state in the subject being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides of the invention can be formulated into preparations for injection by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying them in an aqueous or nonaqueous solvent, such as vegetable or other similar oils, synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides, esters of higher aliphatic acids or propylene glycol; and if desired, with conventional additives such as solubilizers, isotonic agents, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. Other formulations for oral or parenteral delivery can also be used, as conventional in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Disintegrins” refer to a family of polypeptides that may be purified from snake venoms, which contain the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence. Without being bound by any theory or mechanism, it is believed that the RGD tripeptide binds with high affinity to integrins to block the interaction of integrins with RGD-containing proteins. Disintegrins thus block adhesive functions and act as platelet aggregation inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe abbreviation “Rho” means “rhodostomin,” which is a disintegrin derived from the venom of \nColloselasma rhodostoma. \nRhodostomin non-specifically binds to integrins αIIbβ3, α5β1 and αvβ3, and prolongs blood clotting time by inhibiting platelet aggregation through the blockade of platelet glycoprotein αIIbβ3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “disintegrin variant” or “rhodostomin variant” refers to a functionally active protein, or a polypeptide or any derivatives thereof, that comprises an amino acid sequence derived or modified or mutated from a wild-type disintegrin such as rhodostomin. A functionally active disintegrin/rhodostomin variant can specifically bind to and inhibit integrin αvβ3 activity. The disintegrin or rhodostomin variant of the present invention can be constructed by any method suitable to the aims of the present invention, and in one embodiment by a site-directed mutagenesis method, and in another embodiment by a polymerase chain reaction method. Variants may include insertions, additions, deletions, or substitutions compared with the subject peptides. Variants of polypeptide sequences include biologically active polymorphic variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides of the invention can include naturally-occurring and non-naturally occurring amino acids. Peptides can comprise D-amino acids, a combination of D- and L-amino acids, and various “designer” or “synthetic” amino acids (for example, β-methyl amino acids, Cα-methyl amino acids, and Nα-methyl amino acids, etc.) to convey special properties.

The exact amount will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques.

Disintegrin variants such as RD-related compounds potently inhibit osteoclast differentiation in vitro. They also inhibit osteoclast resorbing activity and ovariectomy-induced increase in osteoclast formation in animal studies. In addition, RD inhibits the tumor growth of human prostate and breast cancer cells in bone. Malignancy-induced hypercalcemia was also effectively blocked by RD-related proteins. Paget's disease (also known as osteitis deformans) is a chronic bone disorder that typically results in enlarged and deformed bones due to irregular breakdown and formation of bone tissues. Bisphosphonates have been approved for the treatment of Paget's disease. Osteoarthritis is also related to the increase in osteoclast activity. Based on the similar mechanism of action, RD derivatives should also be effective for treatment of these bone disorders. An intravenous injection of RD or PGP at a very large dose at 30 mg/kg did not affect the survival of mice (n=3). In addition, long term administration of PGP (I.V., 0.5 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks did not affect serum level of creatinine, GOT, and GPT, suggesting lack of side effects on kidney and liver. Therefore, RD and its derivatives are potential drug candidates for treatment of osteoporosis, bone tumor, malignancy-induced hypercalcemia, Paget's disease, rheumatic arthritis, osteoarthritis and angiogenesis-related eye diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany kinds of snake venom contain proteins that comprise an RGD domain. These RGD domain-containing proteins are called disintegrins. A modification in the sequence spanning the RGD domain results in a very unique polypeptide variant with a reduced binding affinity to other kinds of integrins but an increased selectivity to αvβ3 integrin. The disintegrin variants including rhodostomin variants prove to be potential therapeutic candidates for, among others, osteoporosis, suppression of tumor growth in bone, and angiogenesis-related eye diseases. Moreover, disintegrin variants including rhodostomin variants having a RGD-motif region with at least one amino acid substitution may be valuable tools for developing selective antagonists of αvβ3 integrin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne aspect of the invention is a polypeptide that has integrin αvβ3 receptor-antagonist activity and reduced integrin αIIbβ3 and/or α5β1 receptor-blocking activity as compared to a wild-type disintegrin.

Briefly, a total of 10 μg plasmids containing DNA encoding rhodostomin or its variants were purified and digested with Sac I to linearize the plasmids. \nPichia \nstrain X33 was transformed with the linearized constructs by a heat shock method, using a \nPichia \nEasyComp™ kit from Invitrogen®. The transformant integrated at the 5′ AOX1 locus by a single crossover. PCR was used to analyze \nPichia \nintegrants to determine if the Rho gene had been integrated into the \nPichia \ngenome, and cells were lysed by Lyticase (Sigma). Colonies were selected on agar plates containing YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, and 2% agar) and 100 μg/ml Zeocin. A number of clones with multiple copies of Rho gene insertions were selected to pick the clone having the highest Rho protein expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant Rho and its variants were produced as follows: Selected colonies were grown in the YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) containing 100 μg/ml Zeocin™ at 30° C. After 48 hours, cells were collected by centrifugation and grown in 1 liter of minimal methanol medium (containing 1.34% yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate without amino acids and 4×10\n−5\n% biotin). A total of 1% methanol was added once every 24 hours to induce Rho or variant expression for 2 days. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation and dialyzed twice against 5 liter buffer A (5 mM EDTA, 8M urea and 10 mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 7.7). The final solution was loaded into a nickel-chelating column and eluted with a gradient of 200 mM imidazole. The recombinant rhodostomin and its variants were further purified by HPLC (reverse phase C18 HPLC). The purified recombinant Rho had a purity of greater than 95% as judged by Tricine-SDS-PAGE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRho and its variants were subsequently subjected to electrospray mass spectrometry analyses for checking the molecular weight.

Saline or proteins were injected intravenously through the tail vein of the mouse (ICR, male, with an average body weight of 23.5±1.8 g). A sharp cut of 0.5 mm from the tail tip of the mouse was made 5 min after injection. The tail was then immediately immersed in a saline-filled beaker, kept at 37° C., and the bleeding time was measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n shows the effects of RD and ARLDDL proteins on tail bleeding time in mice. Tail bleeding time was measured 5 min after intravenous administration of saline, RD, ARLDDL, rhodostomin (0.6 mg/kg for each) of HSA-RD (5 mg/kg). An intravenous injection of rhodostomin (0.5 mg/kg) exerted a pronounced effect in prolonging the clotting time in mice. However, both RD and ARLDDL (0.5 mg/kg), which exerted selectivity for αvβ3 integrin, only slightly affected the clotting time in mice as compared to rhodostomin. Results are expressed as the mean±S.E.M (n=6).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nPlatelet aggregation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nVenous blood (9 parts) samples from healthy donors who had not received any medication for at least two weeks were collected in 3.8% sodium citrate (1 part). Blood samples were centrifuged at 150×g for 10 min to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and allowed to stand for 5 min, and PRP was collected. The platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was prepared from the remaining blood by centrifuging at 2000×g for 25 min. The PPP platelet count was measured on a hematology analyzer and diluted to 250,000 platelets/μl. A solution of 190 μl of PRP and 10 μl of either Rho or PBS buffer were incubated for 5 min in a Hema Tracer 601 aggregometer at 37° C. Ten microliters of 200 μM adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were further added to monitor the response of platelet aggregation by light transmission.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\nCell Adhesion Inhibition Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nCell adhesion inhibition assays were performed as described previously in Zhang, X.

Briefly, wells of 96-well Immulon-2 microtiter plates (Costar, Corning, USA) were coated with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 10 mM phosphate buffer, 0.15M NaCl, pH 7.4) containing substrates at a concentration of 50-500 nM, and incubated overnight at 4° C. The substrates and their coating concentrations were fibrinogen (Fg) 200 μg/ml, vitronectin (Vn) 50 μg/ml, and fibronectin (Fn) 25 μg/ml. Non-specific protein binding sites were blocked by incubating each well with 200 μl of heat-denatured 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Calbiochem) at room temperature (25° C.) for 1.5 hr. The heat-denatured BSA was discarded and each well was washed twice with 200 μl of PBS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing αvβ3 (CHO-αvβ3) and αIIbβ3 (CHO-αIIbβ3) integrins were maintained in 100 μl of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) medium. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing integrins αvβ3 (CHO-αvβ3) and αIIbβ3 (CHO-αIIbβ3) were kindly provided by Dr. Y. Takada (Scripps Research Institute). Human erythroleukemia K562 cells were purchased from ATCC and cultured in the RPMI-1640 medium containing 5% fetal calf serum. CHO and K562 cells growing in log phase were detached by trypsinization and used in the assay at 3×10\n5 \nand2.5×10\n5 \ncells/ml, respectively. Rho and its variants were added to the cultured cells and incubated at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nfor 15 minutes. Rho and its variants were used as inhibitors at the concentrations of 0.001-500 μM. The treated cells were then added into the coated plate and reacted at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nfor 1 hour. The incubation solution was then discarded and non-adhered cells were removed by washing twice with 200 μl PBS. Bound cells were quantified by crystal violet staining. Briefly, the well was fixed with 100 μl of 10% formalin for 10 minutes and dried. Fifty microliters of 0.05% crystal violet were then added into the well at room temperature for 20 minutes. Each well was washed with 200 μl of distilled water four times and dried. Colorization was carried out by adding 150 μl of colorizing solution (50% alcohol and 0.1% acetic acid). The resulting absorbance was read at 600 nm and the readings were correlated with the number of adhering cells. Inhibition was defined as % inhibition=100−[OD\n600 \n(rhodostomin variant-treated sample)/OD\n600 \n(untreated sample)]×100.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nInhibitory Effects of RD and its Derivatives on Integrins αvβ3, αIIbβ3, and α5β1\n\n\n \n \n \nThe IC\n50 \nof RD and its derivatives on integrin binding was obtained by the cell adhesion assay as described in Example 5 above. Briefly, matrix proteins such as fibronectin, vitronectin, or fibrinogen, were coated at a fixed concentration on microtiter plates, as described in Example 5, and Rho and its variants were added to the cells expressing integrin at different concentrations ranging from 0.001-500 μM to obtain an IC\n50\n. The lower the IC\n50\n, the greater the specificity or potency of the variant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe modification of the RGD motif of Rho had unique effects on Rho's biological activities: the activity in inhibiting the integrin αIIbβ3 or α5β1's binding to the matrix proteins was reduced and the selectivity to the integrin αvβ3 was increased as a result of the sequence modification. Table 4 shows the result of IC\n50 \nfor inhibition of cell adherence by Rho and its derivatives.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of Cell adhesion to ECM by RD and its Derivatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGD motif\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariant &\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO:\n\n\nαllbβ3/Fg\n\n\nαvβ3/Fg\n\n\nα5β1/Fn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n48\nPRGDMP\n53\n (29)\n\n\n   21.0 ± 11.2 (17\na\n)\n\n\n 13.0 ± 5.7 (20)\n\n\n  256.8 ± 87.5 (21)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n48\nARGDDP\n53\n (30)\n\n\n  850.9 ± 322.6 (3)\n\n\n 45.3 ± 17.4 (3)\n\n\n 5044.5 ± 1554.5 (3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n48\nARGDDV\n53\n (31)\n\n\n  255.2 ± 107.2 (3)\n\n\n 15.8 ± 5.5 (3)\n\n\n  213.1 ± 74.4 (3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n48\nARGDDL\n53\n (32)\n\n\n 1518.1 ± 740.4 (4)\n\n\n 41.3 ± 16.0 (5)\n\n\n  526.7 ± 200.3 (5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n48\nPRGDDL\n53\n (33)\n\n\n 1224.0 ± 231.2 (4)\n\n\n 76.0 ± 16.0 (4)\n\n\n 3017.0 ± 801.5 (3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n48\nARGDDM\n53\n (34)\n\n\n  627.2 ± 317.6 (3)\n\n\n 49.0 ± 19.2 (6)\n\n\n  350.8 ± 81.0 (4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n48\nPRGDDM\n53\n (35)\n\n\n 1117.8 ± 379.7 (3)\n\n\n211.0 ± 91.3 (5)\n\n\n 4047.3 ± 1784.3 (4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n48\nPRLDMP\n53\n (36)\n\n\n 2219.8 ± 996.9 (6)\n\n\n 35.0 ± 14.1 (5)\n\n\n 3043.3 ± 1117.6 (4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n48\nPRLDMP\n53\n-5K\n\n\n 2408.0 ± 1090.0 (2)\n\n\n114.8 ± 51.1 (4)\n\n\n>3730 (3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n48\nPRLDDL\n53\n (37)\n\n\n>5880 (3)\n\n\n342.3 ± 110.1 (3)\n\n\n>5880 (4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n48\nARLDDL\n53\n (38)\n\n\n59217.8 ± 966.4 (3)\n\n\n 36.8 ± 12.8 (3)\n\n\n23171.0 ± 925.5 (3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n48\nPRIDMP\n53\n (39)\n\n\n>5880 (2)\n\n\n119.9 ± 19.7 (3)\n\n\n>5880 (3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n48\nPRHDMP\n53\n (40)\n\n\n 2109.0 ± 810.0 (3)\n\n\n131.6 ± 35.3 (3)\n\n\n>5880 (3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n48\nPRGDNP\n53\n (41)\n\n\n  185.0 ± 61.7 (4)\n\n\n 24.8 ± 13.1 (5)\n\n\n  357.0 ± 80.6 (3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n48\nPRGDGP\n53\n (42)\n\n\n 2591.0 ± 572.2 (3)\n\n\n204.1 ± 87.0 (3)\n\n\n 3462.0 ± 1525.5 (4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n48\nPRGDMP\n53 \n(29) refers to the RGD motif of Rho and comprises an amino acid sequence set forth by SEQ ID NO: 29; \n48\nPRLDMP\n53 \n(36) refers to the RGD motif variant of RD and comprises an amino acid sequence set forth by SEQ ID NO: 36.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nThe numbers represents the numbers of experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rhodostomin variants have a much lower affinity to αIIbβ3 and/or α5β1 as compared to the Rho (Table 4).

Moreover, the IC\n50 \nof ARLDDL in inhibition of integrins αIIbβ3 and α5β1 increased more than 2000-fold compared to that of the Rho. The IC\n50 \nof pegylated RD and human albumin-conjugated RD on αIIbβ3 binding increased 113.7- and 129.9-fold, respectively, as compared to that of the Rho (Table 5). Therefore, the variants' affinities to platelets were markedly reduced compared to that of Rho (Table 5).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\nEffects of RD and its Derivatives on Osteoclastogenesis\n\n\n \n \n \nOsteoclasts are specialized monocyte/macrophage family members that differentiate from bone marrow hematopoietic precursors. Cultures of osteoclast precursors in the presence of M-CSF (20 ng/ml) and sRANKL (50 ng/ml) for 8 days induced the formation of large mature osteoclasts with multi-nuclei, which were characterized by the acquisition of mature phenotypic markers, such as TRAP. The method of osteoclastogenesis from cultured hematopoietic cells of bone marrow and the effects of RD and its derivatives on osteoclastogenesis were investigated as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBone marrow cells were prepared by removing femurs from 6˜8-week-old SD rats and flushing the bone marrow cavity with a-MEM which was supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 2 mM-glutamine, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The non-adherent cells (hematopoietic cells) were collected and used as osteoclast precursors after 24 hr. Cells were seeded at 1×10\n6 \ncells/well (0.5 ml) in 24-well plates in the presence of human recombinant soluble RANKL (50 ng/mI) and murine M-CSF (20 ng/ml). The culture medium was replaced every 3 days. Osteoclast formation was confirmed by an assay of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) on day-8. In brief, adherent cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 3 min. After treatment with ethanol/acetone (50:50 v/v) for 1 min, the cell surface was air-dried and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in an acetate buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0) containing 0.01% naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma) and 0.03% fast red violet LB salt (Sigma) in the presence of 50 mM sodium tartrate. Osteoclast-like TRAP-positive cells in each well were scored by counting the number of TRAP-positive and multinucleated cells containing more than three nuclei.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRD derivatives markedly inhibited the differentiation of osteoclasts, which was correlated with their inhibitory activities on αvβ3 (Table 5). On the other hand, AKGDWN and PRGEMP were less effective in inhibiting integrin αvβ3 and differentiation of osteoclasts (Table 5).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of Platelet Aggregation, Cell adhesion, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOsteoclastogenesis by RD and its Derivatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlatelet aggregation\n\n\nαvβ3\n\n\nα5β1\n\n\nαIIbβ3\n\n\nOsteoclastogenesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRhodostomin\n\n\n83\n\n\n13\n\n\n257\n\n\n21\n\n\n5.52\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARGDDL\n\n\n455\n\n\n41\n\n\n527\n\n\n1518\n\n\n8.02\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPGP\n\n\n283\n\n\n24\n\n\n4000\n\n\n500\n\n\n5.76\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRD\n\n\n433\n\n\n35\n\n\n3043\n\n\n2220\n\n\n3.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRID\n\n\n448\n\n\n120\n\n\n>5850\n\n\n>5850\n\n\n5.82\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRGDDL\n\n\n396\n\n\n76\n\n\n3017\n\n\n1224\n\n\n3.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\nARLDDL\n\n\n10380\n\n\n37\n\n\n23171\n\n\n59217\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRPDDL\n\n\n3530\n\n\n188\n\n\n21381\n\n\n13590\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAKGDWN\n\n\n138\n\n\n96637\n\n\n>119000\n\n\n69\n\n\n78400\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRGEMP\n\n\n4908\n\n\n>17850\n\n\n>5950\n\n\n>59500\n\n\n68200\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPegylated-RD\n\n\n398\n\n\n115\n\n\n>5880\n\n\n2408\n\n\n3.88\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHSA-RD\n\n\n438\n\n\n45\n\n\n>5880\n\n\n2750\n\n\n6.68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 8 \n\n\nOvariectomy-Induced Osteoporosis\n\n\n \n \n \nFemale Sprague-Dawley rats (3 months old, 270˜290 g) or ICR mice (4 weeks old, 22˜28 g) were used for this study. Rats or mice were ovariectomized (OVX) bilaterally under trichloroacetaldehyde anesthesia and control rats were sham-operated (Sham) for comparison. The animals were all kept under controlled conditions at the room temperature (22±1° C.) and a 12-hr light-dark cycle. Animals were fed with Purina Laboratory Rodent Diet (PMI; St. Louis, Mo.) (0.95% calcium) and water ad libitum. The body weights of the rats were recorded weekly.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\nAnalysis of Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and Content (BMC)\n\n\n \n \n \nAt the end of the experiment, rats or mice were sacrificed by decapitation. The tibia and femur were removed, cleaned of soft tissue, and the length and weight of the tibia and femur were measured with a precision caliper (±0.05 mm) as described by Weinreb M, Rodan G A, Thompson D D., (1991) \nDepression of osteoblastic activity in immobilized limbs of suckling rats, \nJ Bone Miner Res 6:725-731. BMD and BMC of the tibia were measured with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometer (DEX, XR-26; Norland, Fort Atkinson, Wis.). The mode adapted to the measurements of small subjects was adopted. See Chih-Hsin et al., “Enhancement of Fibronectin Fibrillogenesis and Bone Formation by Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor via Protein Kinase C-Dependent Pathway in Rat Osteoblasts,” Mol. Pharmacol: 66: 440-449, (2004). A coefficient of variation of 0.7% was calculated from daily measurements of BMD on a lumbar phantom for more than 1 year [22, 23]. The whole tibia and femur were scanned and BMD and BMC were measured by an absorptiometer.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 10\n\n\nHistomorphometry of Bone\n\n\n \n \n \nTibiae were fixed by 4% formaldehyde and then decalcified with 12% EDTA and dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol solution and acetone, and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (5 mm) were cut longitudinally and stained with Mayer's hematoxylin-eosin solution. Images of the growth plate and proximal tibia were photographed using an Olympus microscope. The bone volume was measured using an image analysis software (Image-pro plus 3.0) in the secondary spongiosa, which was located under the primary spongiosa and characterized by a network of larger trabeculae. To measure the number of osteoclasts, the sections were stained with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 11\n\n\nBiomechanical Three-Point Bending Test\n\n\n \n \n \nMechanical properties of bone tissues were measured by performing three-point bending test in a material testing system (MTS-858, MTS System Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.). The span of the two support points was 20 millimeters and the deformation rate was 1 mm/min. Load/deformation curves were input to a computer and analyzed by Team 490 software (version 4.10, Nicolet Instrument Technologies Inc., Madison, Wis.). Cross-sectional parameters were measured from the photographs and used in the calculation of the cross-sectional moment of inertia. The cross-sectional moment of inertia was calculated under the assumption that the cross-sections were elliptically shaped [24]:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nI\n=π[(\nab\n3×(\na×\n2\nt\n)(\nb×\n2\nt\n)3)/64\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwhere a is the width of the cross section in the mediolateral direction, b is the width of the cross section in the anteroposterior direction, and t is the average of the cortical thickness. All of these parameters were obtained using the image software Image Pro Plus 3.0 for Windows (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, Md.). The maximal stress, ultimate stress, and elastic modulus (Young's modulus) were calculated using the following equations [25]:\n\n\n \n \n \nσ=\nFLc/\n41\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nE=F/d \n \n \n L\n3/48\nI \n \n\n\n \n \nwhere σ is ultimate stress, c is the distance from the center of mass (equal to ½ b as described above), F is the applied load (N), d is the displacement (mm), and L is the span between the two support points of the bending fixture (mm). In addition, the energies in the ultimate stress were measured by computing the respective areas under the stress-strain curve.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 12\n\n\nInhibition of OVX-Induced Bone Loss by RD Derivatives in Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nTo examine the effects of RD derivatives on bone loss, osteoporosis was induced in female mice by ovariectomy (OVX), as described in Example 8. OVX mice showed a decrease in BMD and BMC of total body. Treatment with RD derivatives (I.M., 1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) or alendronate (p.o., 1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) for 2 weeks inhibited the loss of BMD and BMC (Table 6). The blood concentration of the C-terminal telopeptide of collagen can reflect the osteoclastic activity. As shown in Table 6, RD derivatives or alendronate also inhibited ovariectomy-induced increase in osteoclast activity (Table 6). It appeared that some of the RD derivatives were much more effective than alendronate. In addition, treatment with RD (I.M., 1.5 mg/kg) once per week for 2 weeks also inhibited the loss of BMD and BMC (Table 6). These data indicate that RD and its derivatives may inhibit osteoporosis at longer dosing intervals.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of OVX-induced bone loss by RD and its derivatives in mice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nC-terminal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\ntelopeptide of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCOL(1)α1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBMD (g/cm\n2\n)\n\n\nBMC (g)\n\n\nchain (ng/ml)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Alternate day)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSham\n\n\n0.095 ± 0.001\n\n\n0.649 ± 0.011\n\n\n395 ± 11.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX\n\n\n0.075 ± 0.002*\n\n\n0.517 ± 0.007*\n\n\n686 ± 12.1*\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + RD\n\n\n0.091 ± 0.001§\n\n\n0.627 ± 0.008§\n\n\n391 ± 8.3§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + PGP\n\n\n0.092 ± 0.001§\n\n\n0.621 ± 0.006§\n\n\n372 ± 24.2§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + ARGDDL\n\n\n0.093 ± 0.001§\n\n\n0.624 ± 0.007§\n\n\n389 ± 16.4§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + RID\n\n\n0.091 ± 0.001§\n\n\n0.622 ± 0.004§\n\n\n391 ± 12§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + Rhodostomin\n\n\n0.090 ± 0.001§\n\n\n0.619 ± 0.006§\n\n\n397 ± 13.6§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + PRLDDL\n\n\n0.091 ± 0.002§\n\n\n0.563 ± 0.056§\n\n\n410 ± 25.1§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + Alendronate\n\n\n0.086 ± 0.002§\n\n\n0.607 ± 0.051§\n\n\n504 ± 19.6§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + pegylated-RD\n\n\n0.092 ± 0.002§\n\n\n0.629 ± 0.008§\n\n\n398 ± 9.2§\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Once/week)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + RD\n\n\n0.085 ± 0.002§\n\n\n0.582 ± 0.009§\n\n\n533 ± 27.4§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVX + pegylated-RD\n\n\n0.087 ± 0.005§\n\n\n0.595 ± 0.009§\n\n\n538 ± 19.8§\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues are means ± SE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Compared with Sham-group, p < 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§Compared with OVX-group, p < 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 13\n\n\nInhibition of Ovariectomy-Induced Bone Loss by PGP and RD Derivatives in Rats\n\n\n \n \n \nPGP (a RD derivative) was chosen to examine in more detail the protection from ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss in rats. Adult female rats (3 month-old) were ovariectomized, as in Example 8, and bone volumes were measured 6 weeks after the ovariectomy, as in Examples 9-11. It was shown that PGP protein inhibited both ovariectomy-induced bone volume decrease and osteoclast number increase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 2A\n, compared to the sham-operated rats (Sham), ovariectomy (OVX) caused a significant loss of the trabecular bone. However, treatment with PGP (IV, 0.3 mg/kg/day or IM, 1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) significantly inhibited the ovariectomy-induced loss of the trabecular bone in secondary spongiosa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nFIG. 2B\n, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining showed that osteoclasts were predominantly localized around the trabecular bone, and that PGP inhibited the OVX-induced increase in osteoclast formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOVX rats also showed an increase in body weight at the end of the experiment. Treatment with PGP (I.V., 0.3 mg/kg/day or I.M., 1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) significantly inhibited the OVX-induced increase in body weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRats also showed a decrease in wet weight, BMD and BMC in both femur and \ntibia\n 6 weeks after the ovariectomy (Table 7). Treatment with PGP (either I.V. or I.M.) inhibited the reduction in wet weight, BMD and BMC of both tibia and femur in OVX rats. Histomorphometry demonstrated that ovariectomy caused the loss of trabecular bone in secondary spongiosa (\nFIG. 2\n). Treatment with PGP markedly reversed the loss of bone volume (\nFIG. 2\n and Table 7). In addition, TRAP staining demonstrated that osteoclasts were predominantly localized around the trabecular bone and OVX increased the osteoclast number. A long-term administration of PGP antagonized the OVX-induced osteoclastic formation (\nFIG. 2\n and Table 7). The serum level of the C-terminal telopeptide of collagen reflects osteoclast activity. It was found that the value was markedly increased in the OVX-group compared with that of the Sham-group, whereas treatment with PGP effectively antagonized the OVX-induced increase in osteoclast activity (Table 7).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of Ovariectomy-induced Bone Loss by PGP Protein in Rats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOVX + PGP (IV)\n\n\nOVX + PGP (IM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSham (n = 22)\n\n\nOVX (n = 22)\n\n\n(n = 13)\n\n\n(n = 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone length, mm\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n4.04 ± 0.01\n\n\n4.04 ± 0.01 \n\n\n4.05 ± 0.01 \n\n\n4.04 ± 0.01 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n3.62 ± 0.01\n\n\n3.62 ± 0.02 \n\n\n3.60 ± 0.02 \n\n\n3.64 ± 0.02 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWet weight, mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n755.5 ± 6.3 \n\n\n647.5 ± 8.5* \n\n\n735.8 ± 8.5§ \n\n\n740.6 ± 8.7§ \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n946.0 ± 10.9 \n\n\n850 ± 9.9* \n\n\n904.9 ± 10.2§ \n\n\n904.0 ± 13.5§ \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMD, g/cm\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n0.108 ± 0.002\n\n\n0.099 ± 0.015*\n\n\n0.109 ± 0.002§\n\n\n0.111 ± 0.002§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n0.131 ± 0.012\n\n\n0.126 ± 0.003*\n\n\n0.130 ± 0.002§\n\n\n0.136 ± 0.002§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMC, g\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n0.301 ± 0.011\n\n\n0.269 ± 0.011*\n\n\n0.286 ± 0.010§\n\n\n0.316 ± 0.009§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n0.420 ± 0.005\n\n\n0.369 ± 0.011*\n\n\n0.422 ± 0.013§\n\n\n0.437 ± 0.009§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone volume, %\n\n\n18.1 ± 1.5 \n\n\n9.4 ± 1.5*\n\n\n14.3 ± 1.5§ \n\n\n16.8 ± 1.8§ \n\n\n\n\n\n\nN.Oc/BS (No/mm)\n\n\n1.77 ± 0.09\n\n\n2.06 ± 0.17*\n\n\n1.83 ± 0.10§\n\n\n1.81 ± 0.09§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC-terminal\n\n\n230 ± 5.1 \n\n\n 459 ± 18.4*\n\n\n 259 ± 22.8§\n\n\n 221 ± 15.1§\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntelopeptide of\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncollagen (n = 5 for each)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nALP, alkaline phosphatase;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN.Oc/BS, osteoclast number/mm bone surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues are means ± SE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Compared with Sham-group, p < 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§Compared with OVX-group OVX, p < 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA three-point bending test was performed in the femur to examine the mechanical activity of the bone.

Compared with sham-operated rats (Sham), ovariectomy (OVX) caused a significant increase in the osteoclast activity. Measurement of the serum level of the C-terminal telopeptide of COL(1)α1 chain showed an increase in the osteoclast activity in OVX rats. The C-terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen increased from a basal level of 361±25.6 (n=15) to 708±50.7 ng/ml (n=15) 28 days after the ovariectomy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRD or alendronate was then post-treated one month after the ovariectomy. The post-treatment with RD (I.M., 1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) or alendronate (p.o., 1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) reversed the ovariectomy-induced increase in osteoclast activity, and RD was much more effective than alendronate (\nFIG. 3\n). Osteoclast activity recovered after the withdrawal of the RD or alendronate treatment. The recovery of osteoclast activity was much faster in the alendronate-treated group than the RD-treated group. However, re-application of RD effectively inhibited the ovariectomy-induced increase in osteoclast activity. The value of the osteoclast in response to the RD treatment was much lower than that in response to the alendronate treatment (\nFIG. 3\n). These results indicate that RD-related proteins have therapeutic effects on the bone loss caused by ovariectomy-induced osteoclastic activation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the second drug treatment period, rats were sacrificed, and BMD and BMC of the tibia and femur were measured. As shown in Table 9, post-treatment of RD effectively reversed the bone loss effect of ovariectomy. With regard to the preservation of the bone volume, RD was more effective than alendronate.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-treatment of RD inhibits OVX-induced bone loss in rats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSham\n\n\nOVX\n\n\nRD\n\n\nAlendronate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone length, mm\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n4.04 ± 0.03\n\n\n4.05 ± 0.03 \n\n\n4.01 ± 0.03 \n\n\n4.02 ± 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n3.69 ± 0.03\n\n\n3.68 ± 0.02 \n\n\n3.71 ± 0.06 \n\n\n3.68 ± 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWet weight, mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n766.6 ± 19.9 \n\n\n 661 ± 18.2*\n\n\n 749 ± 20.1§\n\n\n712.1 ± 10.1§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n1002.6 ± 17.4 \n\n\n 861 ± 10.7*\n\n\n985.3 ± 9.8§ \n\n\n912.4 ± 10.9§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMD, g/cm\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n0.114 ± 0.003\n\n\n0.101 ± 0.002*\n\n\n0.113 ± 0.009§\n\n\n 0.108 ± 0.002§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n0.137 ± 0.002\n\n\n0.121 ± 0.002*\n\n\n0.135 ± 0.004§\n\n\n 0.131 ± 0.003§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMC, g\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTibia\n\n\n0.315 ± 0.013\n\n\n0.272 ± 0.006*\n\n\n0.299 ± 0.011§\n\n\n 0.289 ± 0.009§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFemur\n\n\n0.442 ± 0.012\n\n\n0.391 ± 0.008*\n\n\n0.441 ± 0.018§\n\n\n 0.401 ± 0.017§\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone volume, %\n\n\n18.1 ± 1.2 \n\n\n7.9 ± 2.1*\n\n\n16.3 ± 2.7§ \n\n\n12.1 ± 1.3§\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMD is the abbreviation of bone mineral density;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMC is the abbreviation of bone mineral content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues are means ± SD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Compared with Sham-group, P < 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n§Compared with OVX-group OVX, P < 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRD: I.M. injection (1.5/mg/kg/alternate day)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlendronate: p.o.

Surgery involved anterior cruciate ligation transaction and partial medial meniscectomy. After the surgery, RD protein was administered via intramuscular route (1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) or local joint injection (once/week) until the last day when the rats were sacrificed 6 weeks after the surgery. Each joint was embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned and stained with 0.1% safranin-O and haematoxylin. As shown in \nFIG. 4B\n, the chondrocyte layer in the right knee joint was damaged by arthritis and RD in either intramuscular injection (\nFIG. 4D\n) or local application (\nFIG. 4C\n) inhibited the chondrocyte layer destruction.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 16\n\n\nInhibition of Blood Cytokine Elevation by RD in Osteoarthritis Rat\n\n\n \n \n \nOsteoarthritic rats were generated by surgery as described above.

Human prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3 cells or human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells (1×10\n6 \ncells in 15 ml sterile PBS) were injected into the bone marrow of both the left and right tibia of the SCID mice or nude mice on day-1, respectively. On day-11, the animals were randomly assigned into three groups and the administration of test substances was initiated. RD (1.5 mg/kg) was administered by intramuscular (IM) injection and alendronate (1.5 mg/kg) was given by subcutaneous (SC) injection, once daily for a total of 15 doses (5 days on, 2 days off for 3 weeks). The body weight and tumor growth condition were observed and recorded every week during the experimental period. After one month, the mice were sacrificed and the weight of the hind legs was measured. The weight of the control leg was subtracted to reflect the relative tumor weight. In addition, blood samples were collected at the end of the experiment for the blood count of red blood cells (RBC), white blood cell (WBC) and platelet, and for the measurement of the C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX) and serum calcium concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to determine bone osteolysis, radiographs were taken by a soft X-ray generating unit (Young-kid Enterprise Co., Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan). Animals were deeply anesthetized with trichloroacetaldehyde monohydrate, laid down in a prone position on a Kodak Scientific Imaging film (13×18 cm), and X-ray exposure was performed at 45 kV for 5 seconds. The degree of osteolysis was measured using image analysis software (Image-pro plus 3.0).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 19\n\n\nInhibition of Tumor Growth in Bone and Hypercalcemia\n\n\n \n \n \nTumor cell growth in bone is related to the bone resorption activity. The effect of RD protein on the tumor growth of prostate cancer cells in bone was thus examined. PC-3 cells (1×10\n6\n) were locally injected into the bone marrow cavities of both tibia in SCID mice. RD or alendronate was administered 10 days after the implantation of tumor cells. RD at 1.5 mg/kg was given by the intramuscular (IM) route while alendronate was given at 1.5 mg/kg by the subcutaneous (SC) injection, once daily for a total of 15 doses (5 days on, 2 days off for 3 weeks). The swelling of hind legs was calculated to reflect the tumor growth on day 33. The body weight was measured throughout the experimental period. The results indicated that RD at 1.5 mg/kg caused a significant inhibition in tumor cell-induced swelling in hind legs on day-33 (43.8±4.1%, n=21-22) (\nFIG. 7\n). However, the subcutaneous administration of alendronate at 1.5 mg/kg did not inhibit the tumor growth in legs (\nFIG. 7\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 8\n shows the effect of RD on the decrease in body weight in response to the tumor growth in SCID mice. Untreated control mice showed a decrease in body weight at the end of the experiment. Treatment with RD prevented the loss of body weight caused by the tumor growth. Alendronate was used as a positive control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 9\n shows the inhibition of tumor growth and osteolytic bone lesion by RD in SCID mice. In order to determine bone osteolysis, radiographs were taken by a soft X-ray generating unit. In \nFIG. 9A\n, photographs were taken 33 days after the intratibial injection of PC-3 cells. A visible spherical tumor grew up from the proximal tibia. Treatment with RD (I.M., 1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) inhibited tumor growth. In \nFIG. 9B\n, radiographs taken on day-33 revealed that osteolytic lesions appeared in the cancer cell-injected tibia and treatment of RD inhibited osteolysis. \nFIG. 9C\n shows the quantitation of the data. \nFIG. 9D\n shows that RD inhibited a tumor-induced increase in C-terminal telopeptides of type-collagen (a marker for the osteoclast activity) using an ELISA method. \nFIG. 9E\n demonstrates that RD and alendronate (1.5 mg/kg/alternate day) also inhibited a tumor-induced increase in the serum calcium concentration (i.e., hypercalcemia). *: p<0.05, as compared with control. #: p<0.05, as compared with the PC-3-injected group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBreast cancer has a strong predilection for metastasizing to bone. \nFIG. 10\n shows inhibition of tumor growth by RD in nude mice.

Treatment with RD (IM, 1.5 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks inhibited MDA-MB-231-induced increase in tumor growth in bone (\nFIG. 10A\n). Furthermore, RD also prevented the tumor-induced increase in osteoclast activity (\nFIG. 10B\n) and hypercalcemia (\nFIG. 10C\n), but did not affect the blood counts of RBC, WBC and platelet (\nFIGS. 10D-10F\n). *: p<0.05, as compared with the control. #: p<0.05, as compared with the MDA-MB-231-injected group.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 20\n\n\nPegylation of RD Protein\n\n\n \n \n \nA pegylated product or a conjugation with albumin can prolong the duration and decrease the antigenicity of a protein drug. In order to minimize the antigenicity and prolong the duration of RD protein, pegylated RD protein was prepared as follows: RD protein (4 mg) in 20 mM NaCNBH\n3 \nat \npH\n 5 was reacted with 5 mM PEGk5-propionaldehyde (O-Methyl-O′-[2-(6-oxocaproylamino)ethyl]polyethylene glycol 5,000)(Sigma) at 4° C. for 12 h. The pegylated RD protein was purified by reverse phase C18 HPLC. The final yield of pegylated RD protein after purification was greater than 60%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Table 6, pegylated-RD inhibited the differentiation of osteoclasts. In addition, treatment with pegylated-RD (I.M., 1.5 mg/kg, once/week) for 2 weeks inhibited the loss of BMD and BMC (Table 6). These data indicate that pegylated-RD did not lose its activity in vivo.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 21\n\n\nMATRIGEL™ Plug Antiangiogenesis Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nIt has been reported that integrin αvβ3 is related to angiogenesis.

Mice remained in the chamber for five days (hyperoxic period, P7 to P12) and were then housed in room air for a further seven days (hypoxic-induced angiogenic period, postnatal 12 days to postnatal 19 days, or P12 to P19). RD (2 μg) was administered via an intravitreous route on day-12 and the mice were sacrificed on day-19.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree sections from one of the eyes of each animal were made, deparaffinized, and stained with hematxylin and eosin. Blood vessel profiles (BVPs) were counted in the inner retina, and included vessels adherent to the inner limiting membrane. Counting was performed on a photomicroscope (Leica) at a magnification of 100×.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 12A\n, RD protein inhibited angiogenesis in a mouse model of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). \nFIG. 12B\n shows reduced BVPs in a mouse model of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) treated with RD protein. Angiogenesis was quantitated by counting blood vessel profiles (BVPs) in the inner retina and extending into the vitreous cavity from three hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections. The ROP group treated with RD (2 μg) (i.e., ROP RD) reduced about 46% of angiogenesis compared to the ROP group treated with vehicle (ROP). (n=7 for each ROP group; n=2 for sham group.) Data are presented as Mean±SE. #: p<0.01, as compared to the sham group. **: p<0.001, as compared to the ROP group.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 24\n\n\nInhibition of Ovariectomy-Induced Osteoporosis by Albumin-Conjugated RD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of albumin-conjugated RD on osteoporosis was examined in ovariectomized female mice. Human serum albumin-conjugated RD (i.e., RD-albumin) was administered as indicated by arrows shown in \nFIGS. 13A and 13B\n. The data for RD was incorporated into \nFIGS. 13A-13D\n for comparison. Serum levels of the C-terminal peptide of type I collagen and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured as indicators of osteoclast and osteoblast activity, respectively. The BMD and BMC were also measured every 2 weeks, as shown in \nFIGS. 13C and 13D\n. Treatment of RD-albumin (15 mg/kg/week) markedly reduced osteoclast, but increased ALP, activities in a reversible manner.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 25\n\n\nInhibition of Rheumatoid Arthritis by RD\n\n\n \n \n \nRheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology characterized by invasive synovial hyperplasia that leads to progressive joint destruction. Osteoclasts, derived from the monocyte/macrophage lineage, play a crucial role in subchondral bone destructions in rheumatoid arthritis. Radiographic studies have shown that in rheumatoid arthritis, osteopenia of the subchondral bone and bone erosion begin at an early stage of the disease, and are gradually exacerbated. See, van der Heijde D M, van Leeuwen M A, van Riel P L, van de Putte L B, \nRadiographic progression on radiographs of hands and feet during the first \n3 \nyears of rheumatoid arthritis measured according to sharp's method \n(\nvan der Heijde modification\n), J Rheumatol 1995; 22:1792-1796. Bone-resorbing osteoclasts are observed at the erosive synovium/bone interface. See, Sakae Tanaka (2007), \nSignaling axis in osteoclast biology and therapeutic targeting in the RANKL/RANK/OPG System, \nAm. J. Nephrol, 27:466-478. A recent review discusses the role of osteoclasts in rheumatoid arthritis. Sato K, Takayanagi H., (2006) \nOsteoclats, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoimmunology, \nCurr Opin Rheumatol 18: 419-426. Therefore, RD-related proteins, which markedly inhibit osteoclast functions, may be useful for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLewis rats are given intradermal/subcutaneous (SC) injections of bovine type II collagen (2 mg/ml in Freund's incomplete adjuvant). As rats develop the rheumatoid disnotease, they are randomly divided into several study groups. Treatment is initiated on the first day when the clinical signs of arthritis are clearly visible, as evidenced, for example, by ankle joint swelling. After measuring the paw volume, rats are sacrificed, and ankle and knee joints are collected for the examination of histopathological change.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 14A-D\n show amino acid sequences of Rho and its variants, SEQ ID NOs: 1, and 57-69, respectively. \nFIGS. 15A-C\n show nucleotide sequences of rhodostomin variants, SEQ ID NOs: 43-56. \nFIGS. 16A-H\n show amino acid and nucleotide sequences of disintegrin variants, SEQ ID NOs: 78-135.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 26\n\n\nPegylation of ARLDDL Protein\n\n\n \n \n \nA pegylated product or a conjugation with albumin can prolong the duration and decrease the antigenicity of a protein drug. In order to minimize the antigenicity and prolong the duration of ARLDDL protein, pegylated ARLDDL (PEG-ARLDDL) protein was prepared substantially as pegylated-RD protein was prepared as described in Example 20.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, ARLDDL protein (4 mg) in 20 mM NaCNBH\n3 \nat \npH\n 5 was reacted with 5 mM PEGk5-propionaldehyde (O-Methyl-O′-[2-(6-oxocaproylamino)ethyl]polyethylene glycol 5,000) (Sigma) at 4° C. for 12 h. PEG-ARLDDL protein was purified by reverse phase C\n18 \nHPLC. The final yield of PEG-ARLDDL protein after purification was greater than 60%.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 27\n\n\nMATRIGEL™ Plug Anti-Angiogenesis Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nTo investigate whether PEG-ARLDDL can inhibit angiogenesis, MATRIGEL™ plug angiogenesis assays were used as described in parent US Patent Application Publication No. 2008-0188413 A1. Briefly, 0.3 ml of MATRIGEL™ (Becton Dickinson Lab.) containing 150 ng recombinant human VEGF and 30 IU heparin was injected subcutaneously into the dorsal region of 6-8 week-old C57BL/6 mice. The MATRIGEL™ formed a plug rapidly. On \nday\n 2, PEG-ARLDDL at 0.5 mg/kg or at 5 mg/kg was intravenously administered via tail. After seven days, the skin of mouse was pulled back and the Matrigel™ plug was excised from it. \nFIG. 17A\n depicts photographs of the plugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeovessels were quantified by measuring the hemoglobin of the plugs as an indication of blood vessel formation with the Drabkin method and Drabkin reagent kit 525 (Sigma) (\nFIG. 17B\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 17A\n (photographs) and \n17\nB (a bar chart) show that PEG-ARLDDL was effective in inhibiting angiogenesis using MATRIGEL™ plug assays because it significantly reduced the hemoglobin content of the Matrigel™ plug as compared with control group. *: P<0.05 versus control\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 28\n\n\nDose-Dependent Inhibition of PC-3 Tumor Growth by PEG-ARLDDL\n\n\n \n \n \nThe human PC-3 (prostate cancer) cells were implanted in Non-Obese Diabetic Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (NOD-SCID) mice as follows. 4 to 5 week-old male NOD-SCID mice were purchased from Laboratory Animal Center of the National Taiwan University. All mice were kept under standard temperature, humidity, and timed lighting conditions and were provided mouse chow and water. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Research of Agriculture Council, ROC and approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Research of the National Taiwan University.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPC-3 tumor cells at 10\n7 \nwere injected subcutaneously in the flank of the mice in serum-free medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne week after PC-3 cells injection, mice were injected intravenously with saline (control, n=4); PEG-ARLDDL (2 mg/kg/week, n=2) and PEG-ARLDDL (10 mg/kg/week, n=4). Tumor volume was measured weekly. After the mice were sacrificed on day 39, tumors were isolated and weighted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor Volume was calculated using the following equation:\n\n\n \n \n \n0.52×(width(cm)\n2\n×length).\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor weight was estimated based on the assumption that 1 mg is equivalent to 1 mm\n3 \nof tumor volume.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 18\n depicts photographs of tumors excised from the control mice (left photograph); mice treated with 2 mg/kg/week PEG-ARLDDL (middle photograph); and mice treated with 10 mg/kg/week PEG-ARLDDL (right photograph).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 19\n is a bar chart that shows that PEG-ARLDDL significantly inhibited tumor growth in the mice treated with PEG-ARLDDL in a dose-dependent manner as measured by tumor weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another experiment, everything was done in the same manner as described above, except that one week after PC-3 cells injection, mice were injected intravenously with saline (control, n=4); PEG-ARLDDL (10 mg/kg/week, n=2) (once every two weeks) and PEG-ARLDDL (10 mg/kg/week, n=4) (once a week). Tumor volume was measured weekly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 20\n is a graph that shows that PEG-ARLDDL significantly inhibited growth of tumors in the mice treated with this protein as measured by tumor volume. 10 mg/kg/week PEG-ARLDDL administered once a week had a stronger inhibitory effect than 10 mg/kg/week PEG-ARLDDL administered once every two weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 21\n depicts photographs of tumors excised from the control mice (left photograph); mice treated with 10 mg/kg/week PEG-ARLDDL once every two weeks (middle photograph); and mice treated with 10 mg/kg/week PEG-ARLDDL once a week (right photograph). The results confirm that tumor volume was the smallest in the mice treated with 10 mg/kg/week PEG-ARLDDL once a week.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 22\n is a bar chart that shows that PEG-ARLDDL significantly inhibited growth of tumors in the mice treated with this protein as measured by tumor weight. After mice were sacrificed on day 39, tumors were isolated and weighted. 10 mg/kg/week PEG-ARLDDL administered once a week had a stronger inhibitory effect than 10 mg/kg/week PEG-ARLDDL administered once every two weeks.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 29\n\n\nEnhancement of the Cytotoxic Activity of Daunomycin by PEG-ARLDDL\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman PC-3 (prostate cancer) cells were implanted in NOD-SCID mice as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPC-3 tumor cells at 10\n7 \nwere injected subcutaneously in the flank of the mice in serum-free medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne week after PC-3 cells injection, mice were injected intravenously with saline (control, n=4); daunomycin (0.05 mg/kg/week, once a week; n=3); PEG-ARLDDL alone (2 mg/kg/week, n=2) and a combination of daunomycin (0.05 mg/kg/week) and PEG-ARLDDL (2 mg/kg/week, n=2). Tumor volume was measured weekly. After the mice were sacrificed on Day 39, tumors were isolated and weighted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 23\n is graph that shows that daunomycin significantly enhanced the cytotoxic activity of PEG-ARLDDL. The tumors were smallest in the mice treated with the combinatorial treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 24\n depicts photographs of tumors excised from the control mice (left photograph); mice treated with daunomycin alone (second from the left photograph); mice treated with PEG-ARLDDL alone (second from the right photograph); and mice treated with a combination of daunomycin and PEG-ARLDDL (right photograph). The photographs demonstrate that the tumor was the smallest in mice treated with a combination of daunomycin and PEG-ARLDDL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 25\n a bar chart that further shows that a combination of daunomycin and PEG-ARLDDL significantly inhibited growth of tumors in the mice, as compared with mice treated with only daunomycin or only PEG-ARLDDL, as measured by tumor weight. There is a synergistic effect from combining the two treatments.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 30\n\n\nInhibition of Osteopontin-Induced Glioma Invasion in Hypoxia by PEG-ARLDDL\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invasion assay was performed using Transwell (Costar, N.Y., USA; \npore size\n 8 μm) in 24-well dishes. Filters were precoated with 30 μl MATRIGEL™ containing 100 μg/ml hyaluronic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApproximately 5×10\n4 \nU87 human glioma cells in MEM containing 0.5% FBS were placed in the upper chamber of the Transwell and 600 μl of the same medium containing 10% FBS was placed in the lower chamber.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPEG-ARLDDL at 10 nM, at 100 nM and at 1 μM was added to the cells in the upper chamber. The plates were incubated for 15 hours at 37 degrees C. in hypoxic condition (94% N\n2\n, 5% CO\n2 \nand 1% O\n2\n). Non-migratory cells on the upper surface of the filters were removed by wiping with a cotton swab. Migrated cells that penetrated through pores and migrated to the underside of the filters were stained with 0.05% crystal violet solution containing 20% methanol. The cell number per well was counted under microscope at 100× magnification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 26\n depicts photographs of the cells that show that osteopontin-induced glioma invasion in hypoxic conditions was markedly inhibited by PEG-ARLDDL. It is clear from the picture in the bottom right hand corner that there are significantly fewer glioma cells after treatment with PEG-ARLDDL at 100 nM than there are glioma cells after treatment with PEG-ARLDDL at 10 nM. The number of glioma cells is the highest when no PEG-ARLDDL was added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 27\n is a bar chart that further confirms that PEG-ARLDDL significantly inhibits glioma invasion in hypoxic condition. When additional 3 ng/ml of OPN were added, the cells which were not treated with PEG-ARLDDL had almost 2-fold increase in invasion glioma cells compared to control. The cells treated with 10 nM PEG-ARLDDL had about 1.2-fold increase in invasion glioma cells compared to control; and the cells treated with 100 nM PEG-ARLDDL had about 0.75-fold increase in invasion glioma cells compared to control. The expression of OPN can be increased in hypoxic condition (94% N\n2\n, 5% CO\n2 \nand 1% O\n2\n). When no additional OPN was added, the cells treated with 100 nM PEG-ARLDDL had virtually no increase in invasion glioma cells compared to control. The cells treated with 1 μM PEG-ARLDDL combined with or without 3 ng/ml of OPN had over 2-fold decrease in invasion glioma cells compared to control.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLE 31\n\n\nInhibition of U87 Human Glioma Tumor Growth by PEG-ARLDDL\n\n\n \n \n \nApproximately 5×10\n4 \nU87 human glioma cells in MEM containing 0.5% FBS were injected subcutaneously in the flank of 4 to 5 week-old male NOD-SCID mice. One week after U87 cells injection, mice were injected intravenously with saline (control; n=1) or PEG-ARLDDL (10 mg/kg, twice per week; n=2). Tumor volume was measured weekly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 28\n contains pictures of a control mouse and its excised tumor (pictures on the left) and pictures of the mouse injected with PEG-ARLDDL and its excised tumor (pictures on the right). The pictures clearly show that PEG-ARLDDL significantly inhibited growth of U87 human glioma tumors in the mice treated with this protein. FIG. 29 is a graph that shows that PEG-ARLDDL significantly inhibited growth of U87 human glioma tumors in the mice treated with this protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe foregoing description of the exemplary embodiments of the invention has been presented only for the purposes of illustration and description and is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(a)-(d) of U.S. Provisional Application 61/228,137, filed 18 Dec. 2009, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nHSF1 is the master regulator of the heat shock response, in which multiple genes are induced in response to temperature increase and other stresses. At non-shock temperatures in humans and other vertebrates, HSF1 is produced constitutively, but is inactive and bound by protein HSP90. At an elevated temperature, HSF1 is released by HSP90, moves from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and trimerizes. This active HSF1 binds to heat shock elements (HSE) in DNA and activates transcription of heat shock genes by RNA polymerase II. The HSE has a consensus sequence of three repeats of NGAAN and is present in the promoter regions of the HSP90, HSP70 and HSP27 genes. During cessation of the heat shock response, HSF1 is phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and returns to an inactive state. The biochemistry of HSF1 is described, inter alia, in Chu et al. 1996 J. Biol. Chem. 271:30847-30857; Huang et al. 1997 J. Biol. Chem. 272:26009-26016; and Morimoto et al. 1998 Nat. Biotech. 16: 833-838.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHSF1 interacts with additional factors. HSF1 binds to DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which is involved in DNA repair. HSF1 is a target of mitogen-activated protein kinases, and its activity is down-regulated when the RAS signaling cascade is active.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional heat shock factor proteins in humans include HSF2, HSF3, and HSF4. HSF1, HSF2, and HSF3 are positive regulators of heat shock gene expression, while HSF4 is a negative regulator. HSF1, HSF2 and HSF4 play a role in transcriptional control of other heat shock proteins. The various HSF proteins share about 40% sequence identity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHSF1 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and viral diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHSF1 and other heat shock proteins (whose expression is increased by HSF1) are over-expressed in, or have otherwise been implicated in breast, endometrial, fibrosarcoma, gastric, kidney, liver, lung, lymphoma, neuroectodermal, neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, prostate, skin, squamous cell, and testicular cancers, leukemia (e.g., promyelocytic leukemia), and Hodgkin's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that heat shock proteins (HSP) may block the pathways of apoptosis and permit malignant cells to arise despite the triggering of apoptotic signals during transformation. HSP expression may also afford protection to cancer cells from treatments such as chemotherapy and hyperthermia by thwarting the pro-apoptotic influence of these modalities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause HSF1 positively regulates HSPs, a need exists for therapeutics that modulate HSF1.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n illustrates various 5′-end modifications of RNAi agents to HSF1.\n\n\n \n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present disclosure encompasses RNAi agents to HSF1, useful in treatment of HSF1-related disease, such as cancer and viral diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure provides RNAi agents directed to the HSF1 (heat shock factor 1) gene. HSF1 is the master regulator of the heat shock response, in which multiple genes are induced in response to temperature increase and other stresses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHSF1 has been implicated in several HSF1-related diseases, including cancer and viral diseases. HSF1 and other heat shock proteins (whose expression is increased by HSF1) are over-expressed in, or have otherwise been implicated in breast, endometrial, fibrosarcoma, gastric, kidney, liver, lung, lymphoma, neuroectodermal, neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, prostate, skin, squamous cell, and testicular cancers, leukemia (e.g., promyelocytic leukemia), and Hodgkin's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause HSF1 positively regulates HSPs, a need exists for therapeutics that modulate HSF1. The RNAi agents of the present disclosure are specific to HSF1 and can reduce expression of HSF1. These RNAi agents are therefore useful in treating cancer and viral diseases.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present disclosure encompasses RNAi agents to HSF1, useful in treatment of HSF1-related disease, such as cancer and viral diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious Embodiments of the Disclosure Include the Following.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn RNAi Agent Comprising an Antisense Strand of an RNAi Agent Described Herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a composition comprising an RNAi agent comprising an antisense strand, wherein the antisense strand comprises at least 15 contiguous nucleotides differing by 0, 1, 2, or 3 nucleotides from the antisense strand of an RNAi agent to HSF1 selected from any sequence provided in a table herein (e.g., Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 3A, Table 8, Table 9A, Table 9B, etc.).

HSF1 is the master regulator of the heat shock response, in which multiple genes are induced in response to temperature increase and other stresses. HSF1 has been designated HGNC ID HGNC:5224, on Chromosome 8q24.3.

A sequence near the N terminus forms the DNA binding domain (numbered approximately aa 13-121; or aa 16-120, Shi et al. Adjacent to this is a hydrophobic region comprising three “leucine zippers” that mediate monomerization and trimerization (numbered approximately aa 126-217; or 137-212; or 137-203. A fourth hydrophobic patch or leucine zipper lies at approximately aa 378-407; this region is involved in negative regulation under non-stress conditions. The central part of the molecule contains a region that regulates the activity of transcriptional activation domains in response to stress. Sequences within the regulatory domain undergo specific phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to stress. This regulatory domain, which is rich in serines and prolines, lies at approximately aa 221-310, or 201-370. The C-terminal portion of HSF1 contains the main transcriptional activation regions; this comprises the 100 most C-terminal amino acids, or aa 395-503, or can perhaps be reduced to AD1 at aa 401-420 (Newton et al.). These domains are described in, inter alia, Green et al. 1995 Mol. Cell. Biol. 15: 3354-3362; and Shi et al. 1995 Mol. Cell. Biol. 15: 4309-4318. The HSF1 RNAi agent of the present disclosure can interact with a specific functional domain or domains of HSF1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, the RNAi agents of the present disclosure specifically bind to HSF1 mRNA, in a sequence corresponding to a functional domain, e.g., in a sequence near the N terminus that forms the DNA binding domain; in the 4/3 hydrophobic repeat or “leucine zipper” that mediates trimerization; in the first, second, third or fourth leucine zipper; in the central part of the molecule that contains several elements that maintain HSF1 in its latent form, or that regulate the activity of transcriptional activation domains in response to stress; in sequences within the regulatory domain that undergo specific phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to stress; in the C-terminal portion of HSF1 that contains the main transcriptional activation regions; in the arrays of amphipathic alpha-helical residues in the amino-terminal domain of HSF family proteins that interact to form coiled coils; and/or in the fourth region of amphipathic alpha-helix in the carboxyl-terminal domain. In other embodiments, the RNAi agents of the present disclosure bind to the 5′ or 3′ UTR [untranslated region(s)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, the RNAi agents of the present disclosure bind to HSF1 mRNA, but not in a sequence corresponding to a functional domain, e.g., not in a sequence near the N terminus that forms the DNA binding domain; not the 4/3 hydrophobic repeat or “leucine zipper” that mediates trimerization; not the first, second, third or fourth leucine zipper; not the central part of the molecule that contains several elements that maintain HSF1 in its latent form, or that regulate the activity of transcriptional activation domains in response to stress; not in sequences within the regulatory domain that undergo specific phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in response to stress; not in the C-terminal portion of HSF1 that contains the main transcriptional activation regions; not in the arrays of amphipathic alpha-helical residues in the amino-terminal domain of HSF family proteins that interact to form coiled coils; not in the fourth region of amphipathic alpha-helix in the carboxyl-terminal domain; or not in the 5′ or 3′ UTRs. In another embodiment, the RNAi agents of the present disclosure bind to the HSF1 mRNA, but not in sequence spanning nt 322 to 340 downstream of the gene transcription start site as described by Rossi et al. 2006 Cancer Res. 66:7678-7685.\n\n\n \nHSF1-Related Diseases\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrase a “HSF1-related disease” means one or more of the following: a proliferative disease, including, e.g., a cancer, wherein the cancer is selected from one or more of cancers of bladder, bone, breast, cervical, colon, colorectal, endometrial, fibrosarcoma, gastric, haematopoietic, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, lymphoma, neuroectodermal, neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, ovary, pancreas, pleura, prostate, skin, squamous cell, stomach, and testicular cancers, leukemia, promyelocytic leukemia, and Hodgkin's disease; a viral disease, wherein the viral disease is selected from one or more of viral diseases mediated in whole or in part by adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, human cytomegalovirus, HTLV-1, SV40, polyoma virus, HIV, and/or Epstein-Barr virus; and an autoimmune disease, wherein the autoimmune disease is selected from one or more of lupus and a rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHSF1 has been implicated in several diseases, including cancer and viral diseases. HSF1 and other heat shock proteins (whose expression is increased by HSF1) are over-expressed in, or have otherwise been implicated in bladder, bone, breast, cervical, colon, colorectal, endometrial, fibrosarcoma, gastric, haematopoietic, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, lymphoma, neuroectodermal, neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma, ovary, pancreas, pleura, prostate, skin, squamous cell, stomach, and testicular cancers, leukemia (e.g., promyelocytic leukemia), and Hodgkin's disease. HSF1 is over-expressed in metastatic prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3M (as compared to the non-metastatic PC-3 line), and other prostate cancer cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe over-expression of HSF1 is correlated with an up-relation of heat shock protein HSP27. Hoang et al. 2000 Am. J. Pathol. 156: 857-864. HSP27 up-regulation is also associated with increased tumorigenicity and invasiveness of some cancers, including colon, breast, promyelocytic leukemia, testicular and prostate. HSF1 also plays a functional role in cancer cells under non-stress conditions; a dominant-negative HSF1 alters DNA content in PC-3 cell populations and inhibits aneuploidy. Wang et al. 2004 J. Biol. Chem. 279: 32651-32659. Many tumor types contain high concentrations of heat shock protein of the HSP27, HSP70, and HSP90 families, which are up-regulated by HSF1. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, applicants note that it has been suggested that heat shock proteins (HSP) may block the pathways of apoptosis and permit malignant cells to arise despite the triggering of apoptotic signals during transformation. HSP expression may also afford protection of cancer cells from treatments such as chemotherapy and hyperthermia by thwarting the pro-apoptotic influence of these modalities. Tang et al. 2005 Cell Stress Chaperones 10: 46-58 and references therein. Rossi et al. also showed that decreasing HSF1 levels increased the sensitivity of uterine cervix carcinoma cells to cisplatin associated with hyperthermia. Over-expression of heat shock proteins is also associated with protection of cancer cells against doxorubicin and hyperthermia and other anti-cancer treatments. Helmbrecht et al. 2000 Cell Prolif. 33: 341-365.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOver-expression of heat shock proteins is also associated with viral infections, including those mediated by adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, human cytomegalovirus, HTLV-1, SV40, polyoma virus, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus. High heat shock protein levels are also associated with autoimmune diseases, including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Inhibition of HSF1, e.g., via use of an anti-HSF1 RNAi agent, can thus be an effective treatment against cancer, and viral and other diseases. Few HSP inhibitors are known, but they include quercetin, a flavonoid that inhibits the HSF1. Zanini et al. 2007 J. Neurochem. 103:1344-354 and references therein. Quercetin can thus be used as a positive control for RNAi agents that inhibit HSF1 in treating a viral disease or cancer.\n\n\n \nHSF1 Gene Sequences in Various Species\n\n\n \n \n \nThe human HSF1 gene has been cloned, Rabindran et al. 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 6906-6910. Various sequences are available for human HSF1, including Genbank identifier NM\n—\n005526.2. The mouse (\nMus musculus\n) HSF1 gene is, for example, Genbank id NM\n—\n008296.2. Another mouse HSF1 sequence is available as Acc. Number XM\n—\n128055 (as used in Yin et al. 2005 J. Mol. Cell.

\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe start (ATG) and stop (TAG) of the human HSF1 sequence and putative start and stop of the cyno HSF1 sequence are indicated in bold underlined. N indicates that the nucleotide was not determined at that position in the sequencing experiment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the HSF1 RNAi agent of the present disclosure comprises a sequence which is identical in the human, mouse and cyno HSF1 gene. This sequence identity facilitates animal testing prior to human testing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the HSF1 RNAi agent comprises a sequence which does not match that of any other gene. In one embodiment, the HSF1 RNAi agent comprises a sequence which differs from all other known non-HSF1 genes by at least 0, 1, 2 or 3 nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the HSF1 RNAi agent comprises a sequence which is identical to that in HSF2, HSF3 or HSF4. In one embodiment, the HSF1 RNAi agent comprises a sequence which is not identical to any in HSF2, HSF3 or HSF4.\n\n\n \nHSF1 RNAi Agent for Use in Treating Various HSF1-Related Diseases\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the HSF1 RNAi agent of the present disclosure comprises a sequence disclosed herein and is administered to a patient in need thereof (e.g., a patient suffering from cancer and/or a viral disease and/or autoimmune disease and/or HSF1-related disease). In one embodiment, the HSF1 RNAi agent of the present disclosure is administered to a patient in need thereof, along with one or more additional pharmaceutical agent appropriate for that disease. For example, a patient suffering from cancer can be administered a pharmacologically effective amount of one or more HSF1 RNAi agent along with a pharmacologically effective amount of one or more of any cancer treatment listed herein, and/or any other cancer treatment known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA patient suffering from a viral disease can be administered one or more RNAi agent to HSF1 and one or more additional viral disease treatment. This additional treatment can be selected from the list of any viral disease treatment listed herein, and/or any anti-viral known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe patient can also be administered more than one RNAi agent to HSF1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of cancer, autoimmune and viral diseases, the RNAi agent(s) and additional disease treatment(s) can be administered in any order, simultaneously or sequentially, or in multiple doses over time. Administration of the RNAi agent and the additional treatment can be, for example, simultaneous, concurrent, separate or sequential.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimultaneous administration may, e.g., take place in the form of one fixed combination with two or more active ingredients, or by simultaneously administering two or more active ingredients that are formulated independently. Sequential use (administration) preferably means administration of one (or more) components of a combination at one time point, other components at a different time point, that is, in a chronically staggered manner, preferably such that the combination shows more efficiency than the single compounds administered independently (especially showing synergism). Separate use (administration) preferably means administration of the components of the combination independently of each other at different time points, preferably meaning that the components (a) and (b) are administered such that no overlap of measurable blood levels of both compounds are present in an overlapping manner (at the same time).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso combinations of two or more of sequential, separate and simultaneous administration are possible, preferably such that the combination component-drugs show a joint therapeutic effect that exceeds the effect found when the combination component-drugs are used independently at time intervals so large that no mutual effect on their therapeutic efficiency can be found, a synergistic effect being especially preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “delay of progression” as used herein means administration of the combination to patients being in a pre-stage or in an early phase, of the first manifestation or a relapse of the disease to be treated, in which patients, e.g., a pre-form of the corresponding disease is diagnosed or which patients are in a condition, e.g., during a medical treatment or a condition resulting from an accident, under which it is likely that a corresponding disease will develop.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Jointly therapeutically active” or “joint therapeutic effect” means that the compounds may be given separately (in a chronically staggered manner, especially a sequence-specific manner) in such time intervals that they preferably, in the warm-blooded animal, especially human, to be treated, still show a (preferably synergistic) interaction (joint therapeutic effect). Whether this is the case, can inter alia be determined by following the blood levels, showing that both compounds are present in the blood of the human to be treated at least during certain time intervals.\n\n\n \nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nFor convenience, the meaning of certain terms and phrases used in the specification, examples, and appended claims, are provided below. If there is an apparent discrepancy between the usage of a term in other parts of this specification and its definition provided in this section, the definition in this section shall prevail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used throughout this disclosure, articles such as “a” and “an” refer to one or more than one (at least one) of the grammatical object of the article.\n\n\n \nRNAi Agent\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “RNAi agent,” “RNAi agent to HSF1”, “siRNA to HSF1”, “HSF1 siRNA” and the like refer to an siRNA (short inhibitory RNA), shRNA (short or small hairpin RNA), iRNA (interference RNA) agent, RNAi (RNA interference) agent, dsRNA (double-stranded RNA), microRNA, and the like, which specifically binds to the HSF1 gene. As used herein, the terms “iRNA” and “RNAi” refers to an agent that contains RNA, and which mediates the targeted cleavage of another RNA transcript via an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) pathway. In one embodiment, the RNAi agent is an oligonucleotide composition that activates the RISC complex/pathway. In another embodiment, the RNAi agent comprises an antisense strand sequence (antisense oligonucleotide). In one embodiment, the RNAi comprises a single strand. This single-stranded RNAi agent oligonucleotide or polynucleotide can comprise the sense or antisense strand, as described by Sioud 2005 J. Mol. Biol. 348:1079-1090, and references therein. Thus the disclosure encompasses RNAi agents with a single strand comprising either the sense or antisense strand of an RNAi agent described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNA interference is a post-transcriptional, targeted gene-silencing technique that uses double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to degrade messenger RNA (mRNA) containing the same sequence as the dsRNA. The process of RNAi occurs when ribonuclease III (Dicer) cleaves the longer dsRNA into shorter fragments called siRNAs. siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) are typically about 21 to 23 nucleotides long and comprise about 19 base pair duplexes. The smaller RNA segments then mediate the degradation of the target mRNA. Dicer has also been implicated in the excision of 21- and 22-nucleotide small temporal RNAs (stRNAs) from precursor RNA of conserved structure that are implicated in translational control. Hutvagner et al. 2001, Science, 293, 834. The RNAi response also features an endonuclease complex, commonly referred to as an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates cleavage of single-stranded mRNA complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA. Cleavage of the target RNA takes place in the middle of the region complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKits for RNAi synthesis are commercially available, e.g., from New England Biolabs and Ambion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of the RNAi agent to HSF1 results in a decrease of HSF1 activity, level and/or expression, e.g., a “knock-down” or “knock-out” of the target gene or target sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable RNAi agent can be selected by any process known in the art or conceivable by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the selection criteria can include one or more of the following steps: initial analysis of the HSF1 gene sequence and design of RNAi agents; this design can take into consideration sequence similarity across species (human, cynomolgus, mouse, etc.) and dissimilarity to other (non-HSF1) genes; screening of RNAi agents in vitro (e.g., at 10 nM in WI-38 cells); determination of EC50 in HeLa cells; determination of viability of WI-38, HeLa and GTL16 cells treated with RNAi agents, wherein it is desired that the RNAi agent to HSF1 not inhibit the viability of these cells; testing with human PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), e.g., to test levels of TNF-alpha to estimate immunogenicity, wherein immunostimulatory sequences are less desired; testing in human whole blood assay, wherein fresh human blood is treated with an RNAi agent and cytokine/chemokine levels are determined [e.g., TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and/or MCP1 (monocyte chemotactic protein 1)], wherein Immunostimulatory sequences are less desired; determination of gene knockdown in vivo using Hep3B subcutaneous tumors in test animals; HSF1 target gene modulation analysis, e.g., using a pharmacodynamic (PD) marker, for example, HSP70 or HSP27, wherein HSF1 knockdown leads to a dose-dependent reduction of HSP70 and HSP27 expression in A375 cells; and optimization of specific modifications of the RNAi agents.\n\n\n \nTargets and Sequences\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, “target sequence” or “target gene” refer to a contiguous portion of the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA molecule formed during the transcription of a gene, e.g., a HSF1 gene, including mRNA that is a product of RNA processing of a primary transcription product. The target portion of the sequence will be at least long enough to serve as a substrate for iRNA-directed cleavage at or near that portion. For example, the target sequence will generally be from about 9-36 nucleotides (“nt”) in length, e.g., about 15-30 nucleotides in length, including all sub-ranges therebetween. As non-limiting examples, the target sequence can be from about 15-30 nt, about 15-26 nt, about 15-23 nt, about 15-22 nt, about 15-21 nt, about 15-20 nt, about 15-19 nt, about 15-18 nt, about 15-17 nt, about 18-30 nt, about 18-26 nt, about 18-23 nt, about 18-22 nt, about 18-21 nt, about 18-20 nt, about 19-30 nt, about 19-26 nt, about 19-23 nt, about 19-22 nt, about 19-21 nt, about 19-20 nt, about 20-30 nt, about 20-26 nt, about 20-25 nt, about 20-24 nt, about 20-23 nt, about 20-22 nt, about 20-21 nt, about 21-30 nt, about 21-26 nt, about 21-25 nt, about 21-24 nt, about 21-23 nt, or about 21-22 nt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “strand comprising a sequence” refers to an oligonucleotide comprising a chain of nucleotides that is described by the sequence referred to using the standard nucleotide nomenclature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term “complementary” refers to the ability of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising a first nucleotide sequence to hybridize and form a duplex structure under certain conditions with an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising a second nucleotide sequence. Such conditions can, for example, be stringent, e.g., 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM PIPES pH 6.4, 1 mM EDTA, 50° C. or 70° C. for 12-16 hours followed by washing. Other conditions, such as physiologically relevant conditions as may be encountered inside an organism, can apply. The skilled person will be able to determine the set of conditions most appropriate for a test of complementarity of two sequences in accordance with the ultimate application of the hybridized nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComplementary sequences within an iRNA, e.g., within a dsRNA as described herein, include base-pairing of the oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising a first nucleotide sequence to an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide comprising a second nucleotide sequence over the entire length of one or both sequences. Such sequences can be referred to as “fully complementary” with respect to each other herein. However, where a first sequence is referred to herein as “substantially complementary” with respect to a second sequence, the two sequences can be fully complementary, or they may form one or more, but generally not more than 5, 4, 3 or 2 mismatched base pairs upon hybridization for a duplex up to 30 base pairs, while retaining the ability to hybridize under the conditions most relevant to their ultimate application, e.g., inhibition of gene expression via a RISC pathway. However, where two oligonucleotides are designed to form, upon hybridization, one or more single stranded overhangs, such overhangs shall not be regarded as mismatches with regard to the determination of complementarity. For example, a dsRNA comprising one oligonucleotide 21 nt in length and another oligonucleotide 23 nt in length, wherein the longer oligonucleotide comprises a sequence of 21 nt that is fully complementary to the shorter oligonucleotide, may yet be referred to as “fully complementary” for the purposes herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Complementary” sequences, as used herein, may also include, or be formed entirely from, non-Watson-Crick base pairs and/or base pairs formed from non-natural and modified nucleotides, in as far as the above requirements with respect to their ability to hybridize are fulfilled. Such non-Watson-Crick base pairs includes, but are not limited to, G:U Wobble or Hoogstein base pairing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “complementary,” “fully complementary” and “substantially complementary” herein may be used with respect to the base matching between the sense strand and the antisense strand of a dsRNA, or between the antisense strand of an iRNA agent and a target sequence, as will be understood from the context of their use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a polynucleotide that is “substantially complementary to at least part of” a messenger RNA (mRNA) refers to a polynucleotide that is substantially complementary to a contiguous portion of the mRNA of interest (e.g., an mRNA encoding HSF1). For example, a polynucleotide is complementary to at least a part of a HSF1 mRNA if the sequence is substantially complementary to a non-interrupted portion of an mRNA encoding HSF1.\n\n\n \nDouble-Stranded RNA\n\n\n \n \n \nThe term “double-stranded RNA” or “dsRNA,” as used herein, refers to an iRNA that includes an RNA molecule or complex of molecules having a hybridized duplex region that comprises two anti-parallel and substantially complementary nucleic acid strands, which will be referred to as having “sense” and “antisense” orientations with respect to a target RNA. The antisense strand, with respect to the mRNA target, is also called the “guide” strand, and the sense strand is also called the “passenger” strand. The passenger strand can include at least one or more of the following: one or more extra nucleotides (e.g., a bulge or 1 nt loop) compared to the other strand, a nick, a gap, etc., compared to the other strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe duplex region can be of any length that permits specific degradation of a desired target RNA through a RISC pathway, but will typically range from 9 to 36 base pairs in length, e.g., 15-30 base pairs in length. Considering a duplex between 9 and 36 base pairs, the duplex can be any length in this range, for example, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, or 36 and any sub-range therebetween, including, but not limited to 15-30 base pairs (“bp”), 15-26 bp, 15-23 bp, 15-22 bp, 15-21 bp, 15-20 bp, 15-19 bp, 15-18 bp, 15-17 bp, 18-30 bp, 18-26 bp, 18-23 bp, 18-22 bp, 18-21 bp, 18-20 bp, 19-30 bp, 19-26 bp, 19-23 bp, 19-22 bp, 19-21 bp, 19-20 bp, 20-30 bp, 20-26 bp, 20-25 bp, 20-24 bp, 20-23 bp, 20-22 bp, 20-21 bp, 21-30 bp, 21-26 bp, 21-25 bp, 21-24 bp, 21-23 bp, or 21-22 bp. dsRNAs generated in the cell by processing with Dicer and similar enzymes are generally in the range of about 19-22 base pairs in length. One strand of the duplex region of a dsDNA comprises a sequence that is substantially complementary to a region of a target RNA. The two strands forming the duplex structure can be from a single RNA molecule having at least one self-complementary region, or can be formed from two or more separate RNA molecules. Where the duplex region is formed from two strands of a single molecule, the molecule can have a duplex region separated by a single stranded chain of nucleotides (herein referred to as a “hairpin loop”) between the 3′-end of one strand and the 5′-end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure. The hairpin loop can comprise at least one unpaired nucleotide; in some embodiments the hairpin loop can comprise at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 20, at least 23 or more unpaired nucleotides. Where the two substantially complementary strands of a dsRNA are comprised by separate RNA molecules, those molecules need not, but can be covalently connected. Where the two strands are connected covalently by means other than a hairpin loop, the connecting structure is referred to as a “linker.” The term “siRNA” is also used herein to refer to a dsRNA as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, an RNA interference agent includes a single stranded RNA that interacts with a target RNA sequence to direct the cleavage of the target RNA. Without wishing to be bound by theory, long double stranded RNA introduced into plants and invertebrate cells is broken down into siRNA by a Type III endonuclease known as Dicer (Sharp et al., Genes Dev. 2001, 15:485). Dicer, a ribonuclease-III-like enzyme, processes the dsRNA into 19-23 base pair short interfering RNAs with characteristic two \nbase\n 3′ overhangs (Bernstein, et al., (2001) Nature 409:363). The siRNAs are then incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) where one or more helicases unwind the siRNA duplex, enabling the complementary antisense strand to guide target recognition (Nykanen, et al., (2001) Cell 107:309). Upon binding to the appropriate target mRNA, one or more endonucleases within the RISC cleaves the target to induce silencing (Elbashir, et al., (2001) Genes Dev. 15:188). Thus, in one aspect the disclosure relates to a single stranded RNA that promotes the formation of a RISC complex to effect silencing of the target gene.\n\n\n \nDown-Regulation of HSF1\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, “down-regulates” refers to any statistically significant decrease in a biological activity and/or expression of HSF1, including full blocking of the activity (i.e., complete inhibition) and/or expression. For example, “down-regulation” can refer to a decrease of at least about 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100% in HSF1 activity and/or expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “inhibit” or “inhibiting” HSF1 refers to any statistically significant decrease in biological activity and/or expression of HSF1, including full blocking of the activity and/or expression. For example, “inhibition” can refer to a decrease of at least about 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100% in HSF1 activity and/or expression. As used herein, the term “inhibit” similarly refers to a significant decrease in activity and/or expression, while referring to any other biological agent or composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “level”, it is meant that the HSF1 RNAi agent can interfere with the detectable level of HSF1, e.g., the level of HSF1 mRNA or the level of HSF1 protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “activity,” it is meant that the HSF1 RNAi agent can alter any known activity of HSF1, as described herein or as known in the literature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “heat shock” (HS) and “heat shock response” (HSR) is meant the biochemical response to environmental stress, such as elevated temperature. In the laboratory, experimental animals and cells can be maintained at a “non-shock” temperature (37° C. or lower) and heat shock can be induced at an elevated temperature (e.g., 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, or 45 degrees C. or higher). Experimentally, heat shock is typically induced at 42, 43 or 44 degrees C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeat shock is characterized by misfolding, denaturation and aggregation of various proteins; the induced heat shock proteins (HSP or HSPs) include chaperone proteins (chaperonins) and others which repair and/or remove these proteins. Genes induced during the heat shock response include, inter alia, HSP90, HSP70 and HSP27. The heat shock response can also be induced (or mimicked) by additional environmental conditions, such as oxidative stress, chemical stress, free radicals, ATP depletion, acidosis, heavy metals, alcohols, presence of antibiotics, inhibitors of energy metabolism, pathological conditions such as ischemia and reperfusion, inflammation, tissue damage, infection and mutant proteins associated with genetic diseases. Jolly et al. 2000 J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 92: 1564-1572; Dai et al. 2007 Cell 130: 1005-1018.\n\n\n \nThe RNAi Agent to HSF1.\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the disclosure pertains to a HSF1 RNAi agent or other antisense nucleic acid complementary to a HSF1 gene (or portion thereof), or a recombinant expression vector encoding the antisense nucleic acid. As used herein, an “antisense” nucleic acid comprises a nucleotide sequence complementary to a “sense” nucleic acid encoding the HSF1 protein (e.g., complementary to the coding strand of a double-stranded DNA, complementary to an mRNA or complementary to the coding strand of a HSF1 gene).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of antisense nucleic acids to down-modulate the expression of a particular protein in a cell is well known in the art. An antisense nucleic acid comprises a sequence complementary to, and is capable of hydrogen binding to, the coding strand of another nucleic acid (e.g., an mRNA). Antisense sequences complementary to an mRNA can be complementary to the coding region, the 5′ or 3′ untranslated region of the mRNA, and/or a region bridging the coding and untranslated regions, and/or portions thereof. Furthermore, an antisense nucleic acid can be complementary to a regulatory region of the gene encoding the mRNA, for instance a transcription or translation initiation sequence or regulatory element. Preferably, an antisense nucleic acid can be complementary to a region preceding or spanning the initiation codon on the coding strand or in the 3′ untranslated region of an mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntisense nucleic acids can be designed according to the rules of Watson and Crick base pairing. The antisense nucleic acid molecule can be complementary to the entire coding region of HSF1 mRNA, but in at least one embodiment is an oligonucleotide which is antisense to only a portion of the coding or non-coding region of HSF1 mRNA. For example, the antisense oligonucleotide can be complementary to the region surrounding the translation start site of HSF1 mRNA. An antisense oligonucleotide can be, for example, about 5, about 10, about 15, about 16, about 17, about 18, about 19, about 20, about 21, about 22, about 23, about 24, about 25, about 30, about 35, about 40, about 45 or about 50 nt in length, or 5, 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 or 50 nt in length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA may have modifications internally, or at one or both ends. Example modifications at the 5′ end are illustrated in \nFIG. 1\n. These include: C6-alkyl (5′-hexylphosphate), 5′-Methyoxy; 5′-inverted dT (idT), and 5′-beta-L-uridine. The modifications at the ends can help stabilize the siRNA, protecting it from degradation by nucleases in the blood. The siRNAs may optionally be directed to regions of the HSF1 mRNA known or predicted to be near or at splice sites of the gene; e.g., exon-intron junctions. The siRNAs can also optionally be designed to anneal to known or predicted exposed and/or single-stranded regions of the mRNA (e.g., loops).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antisense nucleic acid can be constructed using chemical synthesis and enzymatic ligation reactions using procedures known in the art. For example, an antisense nucleic acid (e.g., an antisense oligonucleotide) can be chemically synthesized using naturally-occurring nucleotides or variously modified nucleotides designed to decrease off-target effects, and/or increase the biological stability of the molecules or to increase the physical stability of the duplex formed between the antisense and sense nucleic acids. In at least one embodiment a modified sugar backbone, including a phosphorothioate linkage or its derivatives, and acridine substituted nucleotides can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach of “G,” “C,” “A,” “T” and “U” generally stand for a nucleotide that contains guanine, cytosine, adenine, thymidine and uracil as a base, respectively. However, the term “ribonucleotide” or “nucleotide” can also refer to a modified nucleotide or a surrogate replacement moiety. The skilled person is well aware that guanine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil may be replaced by other moieties without substantially altering the base pairing properties of an oligonucleotide comprising a nucleotide bearing such replacement moiety. For example, without limitation, a nucleotide comprising inosine as its base may base pair with nucleotides containing adenine, cytosine, or uracil. Hence, nucleotides containing uracil, guanine, or adenine may be replaced in the nucleotide sequences of dsRNA featured in the disclosure by a nucleotide containing, for example, inosine. In another example, adenine and cytosine anywhere in the oligonucleotide can be replaced with guanine and uracil, respectively to form G-U Wobble base pairing with the target mRNA. Sequences containing such replacement moieties are suitable for the compositions and methods featured in the disclosure.\n\n\n \nModifications\n\n\n \n \n \nThe skilled artisan will recognize that the term “RNA molecule” or “ribonucleic acid molecule” encompasses not only RNA molecules as expressed or found in nature, but also analogs and derivatives of RNA comprising one or more ribonucleotide/ribonucleoside analogs or derivatives as described herein or as known in the art. Strictly speaking, a “ribonucleoside” includes a nucleoside base and a ribose sugar, and a “ribonucleotide” is a ribonucleoside with one, two or three phosphate moieties. However, the terms “ribonucleoside” and “ribonucleotide” can be considered to be equivalent as used herein. The RNA can be modified in the nucleobase structure or in the ribose-phosphate backbone structure, e.g., as described herein below. However, the molecules comprising ribonucleoside analogs or derivatives must retain the ability to form a duplex. As non-limiting examples, an RNA molecule can also include at least one modified ribonucleoside, including but not limited to a 2′-O-methyl modified nucleotide, a nucleoside comprising a 5′ phosphorothioate linkage group, a terminal nucleoside linked to a cholesteryl derivative or dodecanoic acid bisdecylamide group, a locked nucleoside, an abasic nucleoside, a 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro modified nucleoside, a 2′-amino-modified nucleoside, 2′-alkyl-modified nucleoside, morpholino nucleoside, an unlocked ribonucleotide (e.g., an acyclic nucleotide monomer, as described in WO 2008/147824), a phosphoramidate or a non-natural base comprising nucleoside, or any combination thereof. Alternatively, an RNA molecule can comprise at least two modified ribonucleosides, at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, at least 6, at least 7, at least 8, at least 9, at least 10, at least 15, at least 20 or more, up to the entire length of the dsRNA molecule. The modifications need not be the same for each of such a plurality of modified ribonucleosides in an RNA molecule. In one embodiment, modified RNAs contemplated for use in methods and compositions described herein are peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) that have the ability to form the required duplex structure and that permit or mediate the specific degradation of a target RNA via a RISC pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of modified nucleotides which can be used to generate the antisense nucleic acid include 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-chlorouracil, 5-iodouracil, hypoxanthine, xantine, 4-acetylcytosine, 5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl)uracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluracil, dihydrouracil, beta-D-galactosylqueosine, inosine, N6-isopentenyladenine, 1-methylguanine, 1-methylinosine, 2,2-dimethylguanine, 2-methyladenine, 2-methylguanine, 3-methylcytosine, 5-methylcytosine, N6-adenine, 7-methylguanine, 5-methylaminomethyluracil, 5-methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, beta-D-mannosylqueosine, 5′-methoxycarboxymethyluracil, 5-methoxyuracil, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenine, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), wybutoxosine, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid (v), 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 3-(3-amino-3-N-2-carboxypropyl)uracil, (acp3)w, and 2,6-diaminopurine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, a modified ribonucleoside includes a deoxyribonucleoside. In such an instance, an iRNA agent can comprise one or more deoxynucleosides, including, for example, a deoxynucleoside overhang(s), or one or more deoxynucleosides within the double stranded portion of a dsRNA. However, it is self-evident that under no circumstances is a double stranded DNA molecule encompassed by the term “iRNA.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReplacing the 3′-terminal nucleotide overhanging segments of a 21-mer siRNA duplex having two-\nnucleotide\n 3′-overhangs with deoxyribonucleotides does not have an adverse effect on RNAi activity. Replacing up to four nucleotides on each end of the siRNA with deoxyribonucleotides has been well tolerated, whereas complete substitution with deoxyribonucleotides results in no RNAi activity. International PCT Publication No. WO 00/44914, and Beach et al. International PCT Publication No. WO 01/68836 preliminarily suggest that siRNA may include modifications to either the phosphate-sugar backbone or the nucleoside to include at least one of a nitrogen or sulfur heteroatom. Kreutzer et al. Canadian Patent Application No. 2,359,180, also describe certain chemical modifications for use in dsRNA constructs in order to counteract activation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase PKR, specifically 2″-amino or 2′-O-methyl nucleotides, and nucleotides containing a 2″-0 or 4″-C methylene bridge. Additional 3′-terminal nucleotide overhangs include dT (deoxythimidine), 2′-O,4′-C-ethylene thymidine (eT), and 2-hydroxyethyl phosphate (hp).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParrish et al. (2000 Molecular Cell 6: 1077-1087) tested certain chemical modifications targeting the unc-22 gene in \nC. elegans \nusing long (>25 nt) siRNA transcripts. The authors describe the introduction of thiophosphate residues into these siRNA transcripts by incorporating thiophosphate nucleotide analogs with T7 and T3 RNA polymerase and observed that RNAs with two phosphorothioate modified bases also had substantial decreases in effectiveness as RNAi. Further, Parrish et al. reported that phosphorothioate modification of more than two residues greatly destabilized the RNAs in vitro such that interference activities could not be assayed. Id. at 1081. The authors also tested certain modifications at the 2′-position of the nucleotide sugar in the long siRNA transcripts and found that substituting deoxynucleotides for ribonucleotides produced a substantial decrease in interference activity, especially in the case of Uridine to Thymidine and/or Cytidine to deoxy-Cytidine substitutions. Id. In addition, the authors tested certain base modifications, including substituting, in sense and antisense strands of the siRNA, 4-thiouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-iodouracil, and 3-(aminoallyl)uracil for uracil, and inosine for guanosine. Whereas 4-thiouracil and 5-bromouracil substitution appeared to be tolerated, Parrish reported that inosine produced a substantial decrease in interference activity when incorporated in either strand. Parrish also reported that incorporation of 5-iodouracil and 3-(aminoallyl)uracil in the antisense strand resulted in a substantial decrease in RNAi activity as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art will appreciate that it is possible to synthesize and modify the siRNA as desired, using any conventional method known in the art (see Henschel et al. 2004 DEQOR: a web-based tool for the design and quality control of siRNAs. Nucleic Acids Research 32 (Web Server Issue): W113-W120). Further, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that there are a variety of regulatory sequences (for example, constitutive or inducible promoters, tissue-specific promoters or functional fragments thereof, etc.) which are useful for the antisense oligonucleotide, siRNA, or shRNA expression construct/vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are several examples in the art describing sugar, base, phosphate and backbone modifications that can be introduced into nucleic acid molecules with significant enhancement in their nuclease stability and efficacy. For example, oligonucleotides are modified to enhance stability and/or enhance biological activity by modification with nuclease resistant groups, for example, 2′-amino, 2′-C-allyl, 2′-fluoro, 2′-O-methyl, 2′-O-allyl, 2′-H, nucleotide base modifications (for a review see Usman and Cedergren 1992 TIBS. 17: 34; Usman et al. 1994 Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 31: 163; Burgin et al. 1996 Biochemistry 35: 14090). Sugar modifications of nucleic acids have been extensively described in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional modifications and conjugations of RNAi agents have been described. Soutschek et al. 2004 Nature 432: 173-178 presented conjugation of cholesterol to the 3′-end of the sense strand of a siRNA molecule by means of a pyrrolidine linker, thereby generating a covalent and irreversible conjugate. Chemical modifications (including conjugation with other molecules) of siRNA may also be made to improve the in vivo pharmacokinetic retention time and efficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, the RNAi agent to HSF1 comprises at least one 5′-uridine-adenine-3′ (5′-ua-3′) dinucleotide, wherein the uridine is a 2′-modified nucleotide; at least one 5′-uridine-guanine-3′ (5′-ug-3′) dinucleotide, wherein the 5′-uridine is a 2′-modified nucleotide; at least one 5′-cytidine-adenine-3′ (5′-ca-3′) dinucleotide, wherein the 5′-cytidine is a 2′-modified nucleotide; or at least one 5′-uridine-uridine-3′ (5′-uu-3′) dinucleotide, wherein the 5′-uridine is a 2′-modified nucleotide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, the RNAi agent comprises a 2″-modification selected from the group consisting of: 2′-deoxy, 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro, 2′-O-methyl, 2″-O-methoxyethyl (2′-O-MOE), 2′-O-aminopropyl (2′-O-AP), 2′-O-dimethylaminoethyl (2′-O-DMAOE), 2′-O-dimethylaminopropyl (2′-O-DMAP), 2′-O-dimethylaminoethyloxyethyl (2′-O-DMAEOE), and 2″-O—N-methylacetamido (2′-O—NMA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the RNAi comprises a gap or missing base. For example, the phosphate-sugar backbone may be present, but the base missing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the RNAi agent has a single-stranded nick (e.g., a break or missing bond in the backbone). This nick can be, for example, in the sense strand, producing a small internally segmented interfering RNA, or sisiRNA, which may have less off-target effects than the corresponding RNAi agent without a nick.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antisense nucleic acid or RNAi agent can also have an alternative backbone such as locked nucleic acids (LNA), Morpholinos, peptidic nucleic acids (PNA), threose nucleic acid (TNA), or glycol nucleic acid (GNA), and/or it can be labeled (e.g., radiolabeled or otherwise tagged). One or both strands can comprise an alternative backbone\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the antisense nucleic acid molecule employed by the methods of the present disclosure can include an α-anomeric nucleic acid molecule. An α-anomeric nucleic acid molecule forms specific double-stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which, contrary to the usual β-units, the strands run parallel to each other. Gaultier et al. 1987 Nucleic Acids. Res. 15: 6625-6641. The antisense nucleic acid molecule can also comprise a 2′-o-methylribonucleotide (Inoue et al. 1987 Nucleic Acids Res. 15: 6131-6148) or a chimeric RNA-DNA analogue (Inoue et al. 1987 FEBS Lett. 215: 327-330).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn still another embodiment, an antisense nucleic acid is a ribozyme. Ribozymes are catalytic RNA molecules with ribonuclease activity which are capable of cleaving a single-stranded nucleic acid, such as an mRNA, to which they have a complementary region. Thus, ribozymes [e.g., hammerhead ribozymes (described in Haselhoff et al. 1988, Nature 334: 585-591)] can be used to catalytically cleave HSF1 mRNA transcripts to thereby inhibit translation of HSF1 mRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, gene expression can be inhibited by targeting nucleotide sequences complementary to the regulatory region of HSF1 (e.g., the promoter and/or enhancers) to form triple helical structures that prevent transcription of the HSF1 gene. See generally, Helene 1991 Anticancer Drug Des. 6(6): 569-84; Helene et al. 1992 Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 660: 27-36; and Maher 1992, Bioassays 14(12): 807-15.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the antisense nucleic acid can be produced biologically using an expression vector into which a nucleic acid has been subcloned in an antisense orientation (i.e., RNA transcribed from the inserted nucleic acid will be in an antisense orientation to a target nucleic acid of interest).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antisense nucleic acid molecules of the present disclosure are typically administered to a subject or generated in situ such that they hybridize with cellular mRNA and/or genomic DNA encoding HSF1, and inhibit expression by inhibiting transcription and/or translation. An example of a route of administration of antisense nucleic acid molecules includes direct injection at a tissue site. Alternatively, antisense nucleic acid molecules can be modified to target selected cells and then administered systemically. For example, for systemic administration, antisense molecules can be modified such that they specifically bind to receptors or antigens expressed on a selected cell surface, e.g., by linking the antisense nucleic acid molecules to peptides or antibodies which bind to cell surface receptors or antigens. The antisense nucleic acid molecules can also be delivered to cells using vectors well known in the art and described in, for example, US20070111230, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein. To achieve sufficient intracellular concentrations of the antisense molecules, vector constructs in which the antisense nucleic acid molecule is placed under the control of a strong pol II or pol III promoter can be used.\n\n\n \nRNA Interference\n\n\n \n \n \nRNAi (RNA interference) has been studied in a variety of systems. Recent work in \nDrosophila \nembryonic lysates (Elbashir et al. 2001 EMBO J. 20: 6877 and Tuschl et al. International PCT Publication No. WO 01/75164) has revealed certain requirements for siRNA length, structure, chemical composition, and sequence that are essential to mediate efficient RNAi activity. These studies have shown that 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes are most active when containing 3′-terminal dinucleotide overhangs. Substitution of the 3′-terminal siRNA overhang nucleotides with 2′-deoxy nucleotides (2′-H) was tolerated. In addition, a 5′-phosphate on the target-complementary strand of an siRNA duplex is usually required for siRNA activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of longer dsRNA has been described. For example, Beach et al. International PCT Publication No. WO 01/68836, describes attenuating gene expression using endogenously-derived dsRNA. Tuschl et al. International PCT Publication No. WO 01/75164, describe a \nDrosophila \nin vitro RNAi system and the use of specific siRNA molecules for certain functional genomic and certain therapeutic applications. Li et al. International PCT Publication No. WO 00/44914, describe the use of specific long (141 bp-488 bp) enzymatically synthesized or vector expressed dsRNAs for attenuating the expression of certain target genes.

International PCT Publication No. WO 00/63364, describe certain long (at least 200 nt) dsRNA constructs. Deschamps Depaillette et al. International PCT Publication No. WO 99/07409, describe specific compositions consisting of particular dsRNA molecules combined with certain anti-viral agents. Waterhouse et al. International PCT Publication No. 99/53050 and 1998, PNAS, 95, 13959-13964, describe certain methods for decreasing the phenotypic expression of a nucleic acid in plant cells using certain dsRNAs. Driscoll et al. International PCT Publication No. WO 01/49844, describe specific DNA expression constructs for use in facilitating gene silencing in targeted organisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOthers have reported on various RNAi and gene-silencing systems. For example, Parrish et al. 2000, Molecular Cell 6: 1077-1087 describes specific chemically modified dsRNA constructs targeting the unc-22 gene of \nC. elegans\n. Grossniklaus, International PCT Publication No. WO 01/38551, describes certain methods for regulating polycomb gene expression in plants using certain dsRNAs. Churikov et al.

WO 03/064626 and WO 03/064625 describe certain chemically modified dsRNA constructs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, the RNAi agent to HSF1 is ligated to one or more diagnostic compound, reporter group, cross-linking agent, nuclease-resistance conferring moiety, natural or unusual nucleobase, lipophilic molecule, cholesterol, lipid, lectin, steroid, uvaol, hecigenin, diosgenin, terpene, triterpene, sarsasapogenin, Friedelin, epifriedelanol-derivatized lithocholic acid, vitamin, carbohydrate, dextran, pullulan, chitin, chitosan, synthetic carbohydrate, oligo lactate 15-mer, natural polymer, low- or medium-molecular weight polymer, inulin, cyclodextrin, hyaluronic acid, protein, protein-binding agent, integrin-targeting molecule, polycationic, peptide, polyamine, peptide mimic, and/or transferrin.\n\n\n \nDelivery of RNAi Agents\n\n\n \n \n \nRNAi agents of the present disclosure can be delivered or introduced (e.g., to a cell in vitro or to a patient) by any means known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Introducing into a cell,” when referring to an iRNA, means facilitating or effecting uptake or absorption into the cell, as is understood by those skilled in the art. Absorption or uptake of an iRNA can occur through unaided diffusive or active cellular processes, or by auxiliary agents or devices. The meaning of this term is not limited to cells in vitro; an iRNA may also be “introduced into a cell,” wherein the cell is part of a living organism. In such an instance, introduction into the cell will include the delivery to the organism. For example, for in vivo delivery, iRNA can be injected into a tissue site or administered systemically. In vivo delivery can also be by a beta-glucan delivery system, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,032,401 and 5,607,677, and U.S. Publication No. 2005/0281781 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In vitro introduction into a cell includes methods known in the art such as electroporation and lipofection. Further approaches are described below or known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery of RNAi agent to tissue is a problem both because the material must reach the target organ and must also enter the cytoplasm of target cells. RNA cannot penetrate cellular membranes, so systemic delivery of naked RNAi agent is unlikely to be successful. RNA is quickly degraded by RNAse activity in serum. For these reasons, other mechanisms to deliver RNAi agent to target cells has been devised. Methods known in the art include but are not limited to: viral delivery (retrovirus, adenovirus, lentivirus, baculovirus, AAV); liposomes (Lipofectamine, cationic DOTAP, neutral DOPC) or nanoparticles (cationic polymer, PEI), bacterial delivery (tkRNAi), and also chemical modification (LNA) of siRNA to improve stability. Xia et al. 2002 Nat. Biotechnol. 20 and Devroe et al. 2002. BMC Biotechnol. 2 1: 15, disclose incorporation of siRNA into a viral vector. Other systems for delivery of RNAi agents are contemplated, and the RNAi agents of the present disclosure can be delivered by various methods yet to be found and/or approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes have been used previously for drug delivery (e.g., delivery of a chemotherapeutic). Liposomes (e.g., cationic liposomes) are described in PCT publications WO02/100435A1, WO03/015757A1, and WO04029213A2; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,962,016; 5,030,453; and 6,680,068; and U.S. Patent Application 2004/0208921. A process of making liposomes is also described in WO04/002453A1. Furthermore, neutral lipids have been incorporated into cationic liposomes (e.g., Farhood et al. 1995). Cationic liposomes have been used to deliver RNAi agent to various cell types (Sioud and Sorensen 2003; U.S. Patent Application 2004/0204377; Duxbury et al., 2004; Donze and Picard, 2002). Use of neutral liposomes disclosed in Miller et al. 1998, and U.S. Publ. 2003/0012812.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “SNALP” refers to a stable nucleic acid-lipid particle. A SNALP represents a vesicle of lipids coating a reduced aqueous interior comprising a nucleic acid such as an iRNA or a plasmid from which an iRNA is transcribed. SNALPs are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 20060240093, 20070135372, and in International Application No. WO 2009082817. These applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemical transfection using lipid-based, amine-based and polymer-based techniques, is disclosed in products from Ambion Inc., Austin, Tex.; and Novagen, EMD Biosciences, Inc, an Affiliate of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany); Ovcharenko D (2003) “Efficient delivery of siRNAs to human primary cells.” Ambion TechNotes 10 (5): 15-16). Additionally, Song et al. (Nat. Med. published online (Fete 10, 2003) doi: 10.1038/nm828) and others [Caplen et al. 2001 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 98: 9742-9747; and McCaffrey et al. Nature 414: 34-39] disclose that liver cells can be efficiently transfected by injection of the siRNA into a mammal's circulatory system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of molecules have been used for cell-specific RNAi agent delivery. For example, the nucleic acid-condensing property of protamine has been combined with specific antibodies to deliver siRNAs. Song et al. 2005 Nat. Biotech. 23: 709-717. The self-assembly PEGylated polycation polyethylenimine (PEI) has also been used to condense and protect siRNAs. Schiffelers et al. 2004 Nucl. Acids Res. 32: e149, 141-1 10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe siRNA-containing nanoparticles were then successfully delivered to integrin-overexpressing tumor neovasculature. Hu-Lieskovan et al. 2005 Cancer Res. 65: 8984-8992.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe RNAi agents of the present disclosure can be delivered via, for example, Lipid nanoparticles (LNP); neutral liposomes (NL); polymer nanoparticles; double-stranded RNA binding motifs (dsRBMs); or via modification of the RNAi agent (e.g., covalent attachment to the dsRNA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLipid nanoparticles (LNP) are self-assembling cationic lipid based systems. These can comprise, for example, a neutral lipid (the liposome base); a cationic lipid (for siRNA loading); cholesterol (for stabilizing the liposomes); and PEG-lipid (for stabilizing the formulation, charge shielding and extended circulation in the bloodstream). The cationic lipid can comprise, for example, a headgroup, a linker, a tail and a cholesterol tail. The LNP can have, for example, good tumor delivery, extended circulation in the blood, small particles (e.g., less than 100 nm), and stability in the tumor microenvironment (which has low pH and is hypoxic).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeutral liposomes (NL) are non-cationic lipid based particles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymer nanoparticles are self-assembling polymer-based particles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDouble-stranded RNA binding motifs (dsRBMs) are self-assembling RNA binding proteins, which will need modifications.\n\n\n \nRNAi Agents to HSF1\n\n\n \n \n \nsiRNAs that are particularly useful for this disclosure include those which can bind specifically to a region of the HSF1 mRNA, and have one or more of the following qualities: binding in the coding segment of HSF1; binding at or near the junction of the 5′ untranslated region and the start of the coding segment; binding at or near the translational start site of the mRNA; binding at or near junctions of exons and introns; little or no binding to the mRNAs of other genes (little or no “off-target effects”); binding to the HSF1 mRNA in or near a region or regions that is not double-stranded or a stem region, e.g., in a loop or single-stranded portion; eliciting little or no immunogenicity; binding in a segment of the HSF1 mRNA sequence which is conserved among various animal species (including human, mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, etc.), as the presence of a conserved sequence facilitates testing using various laboratory animals; binding to double-stranded region(s) of the mRNA; binding to an AT-rich region (e.g., at least about 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, or 60% AT-rich); and lacking particular sequences known or suspected to decrease siRNA activity, e.g., the presence of a GG sequence at the 5′ end, which may decrease separation of the double-stranded portion of the siRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRNAi agents can be designed as HSF1 RNAi agents which bind to and assist in degradation of HSF1 mRNA. The anti-HSF1 RNAi agents can be designed to bind to the coding segment or non-coding segment (e.g., the 5′ or 3′ untranslated regions, or UTRs). Preferably the RNAi agent binds to the coding segment of the mRNA. The RNAi agents can have double-stranded regions of, for example, about 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, or 24 bp. Preferably the RNAi agent comprises about 19, 20 or 21 bp. The RNAi agents can be longer (e.g., up to 49 bp), as incorporated into a construct suitable for shortening by the Dicer complex. The RNAi can also be incorporated into a longer construct for expression prior to further shortening and processing.\n\n\n \nSense and Antisense Strand of HSF1 RNAi Agents\n\n\n \n \n \nThe RNAi agents comprise a first strand and a second strand. In one embodiment, the first and second strands are a sense strand and an antisense strand, respectively. In other embodiments, the first and second strands are an antisense and sense strand, respectively. The first strand thus can comprise a sense or antisense strand of any sequence disclosed herein, or a variant sequence thereof comprising 15 contiguous nucleotides with up to 3 mismatches; and the second strand can thus comprise the corresponding antisense or sense strand of any sequence disclosed herein, or a variant sequence thereof comprising 15 contiguous nucleotides with up to 3 mismatches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antisense strand” refers to the strand of an iRNA, e.g., a dsRNA, which includes a region that is substantially complementary to a target sequence. As used herein, the term “region of complementarity” refers to the region on the antisense strand that is substantially complementary to a sequence, for example a target sequence, as defined herein. Where the region of complementarity is not fully complementary to the target sequence, the mismatches may be in the internal or terminal regions of the molecule. Generally, the most tolerated mismatches are in the terminal regions, e.g., within 5, 4, 3, or 2 nucleotides of the 5′ and/or 3′ terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “sense strand,” as used herein, refers to the strand of an iRNA that includes a region that is substantially complementary to a region of the antisense strand as that term is defined herein.\n\n\n \nOverhangs and Blunt Ends\n\n\n \n \n \nThe RNAi agents can have 0, 1, or 2 overhangs; in the case of 0 nt overhangs, both ends are blunt-ended. An RNAi agent can have 0, 1 or 2 blunt ends. In a “blunt-ended RNAi agent” no strands contain unpaired nucleotides at that end; thus a blunt-ended molecule lacks either 3′ or 5′ single-stranded nucleotide overhangs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “overhang” or “nucleotide overhang” refer to at least one unpaired nucleotide that protrudes from the duplex structure of an iRNA, e.g., a dsRNA. For example, when a 3′-end of one strand of a dsRNA extends beyond the 5′-end of the other strand, or vice versa, there is an overhang. A dsRNA can comprise an overhang of at least one nucleotide; alternatively the overhang can comprise at least 2 nt, at least 3 nt, at least 4 nt, at least 5 nt or more. An overhang can comprise or consist of a nucleotide/nucleoside analog, including a deoxynucleotide/nucleoside. The overhang(s) may be on the sense strand, the antisense strand or any combination thereof. The nucleotide(s) of an overhang can be present on the 5′ end, 3′ end or both ends of either an antisense or sense strand of a dsRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “blunt” or “blunt-ended” as used herein in reference to a dsRNA mean that there are no unpaired nucleotides or nucleotide analogs at a given terminal end of a dsRNA, i.e., no nucleotide overhang. One or both ends of a dsRNA can be blunt. Where both ends of a dsRNA are blunt, the dsRNA is said to be blunt ended. To be clear, a “blunt ended” dsRNA is a dsRNA that is blunt at both ends, i.e., no nucleotide overhang at either end of the molecule. Most often such a molecule will be double-stranded over its entire length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a blunt end of an RNAi duplex is chemically modified by the addition of a 3′ cap, e.g., those described in WO 2005/021749 and WO 2007/128477. In such embodiments, the 3′ caps are non-nucleotidic, and thus do not constitute an overhang.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mRNA sequence of a gene may vary from individual to individual, especially at wobble positions within the coding segment, or in the untranslated region; individuals may also differ from each other in coding sequence, resulting in additional differences in mRNA and corresponding RNAi agent sequence. RNAi agents can also be modified in sequence to reduce immunogenicity, binding to undesired genes (e.g., “off-target effects”) or to increase stability in the blood. (These sequence variants are independent of chemical modification of the bases or 5′ or 3′ or other end-caps of the RNAi agents.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExample anti-HSF1 RNAi agents include those which bind to an HSF1 gene provided herein. Example siRNAs to HSF1 are provided in any one or more of Tables 1, 2, 3, 3A, 8, 9A and 9B.\n\n\n \n \nMeasuring the Effect of an RNAi Agent on HSF1 Activity, Level and/or Expression\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny method known in the art can be use to measure changes in HSF1 activity, level and/or expression induced by a HSF1 siRNA. Measurements can be performed at multiple timepoints, prior to, during and after administration of the siRNA, to determine the effect of the siRNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe RNAi agents of the present disclosure silence, inhibit the expression of, down-regulate the expression of, and/or suppress the expression of HSF1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “silence,” “inhibit the expression of,” “down-regulate the expression of,” “suppress the expression of,” and the like, in so far as they refer to a HSF1 gene, herein refer to the at least partial suppression of the expression of a HSF1 gene, as manifested by a reduction of the amount of HSF1 mRNA which may be isolated from or detected in a first cell or group of cells in which a HSF1 gene is transcribed and which has or have been treated such that the expression of a HSF1 gene is inhibited, as compared to a second cell or group of cells substantially identical to the first cell or group of cells but which has or have not been so treated (control cells). The degree of inhibition is usually expressed in terms of\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nEquation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the degree of inhibition may be given in terms of a reduction of a parameter that is functionally linked to HSF1 gene expression, e.g., the amount of protein encoded by a HSF1 gene, or the number of cells displaying a certain phenotype, e.g., modulation of expression of a gene (e.g., HSP70) whose expression is mediated in whole or in part by HSF1. In principle, HSF1 gene silencing may be determined in any cell expressing HSF1, either constitutively or by genomic engineering, and by any appropriate assay. However, when a reference or control is needed in order to determine whether a given iRNA inhibits the expression of HSF1 by a certain degree and therefore is encompassed by the instant disclosure, the assays provided in the Examples below shall serve as such reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in certain instances, expression of a HSF1 gene is suppressed by at least about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, or 50% by administration of an iRNA featured in the disclosure. In some embodiments, a HSF1 gene is suppressed by at least about 60%, 70%, or 80% by administration of an iRNA featured in the disclosure. In some embodiments, a HSF1 gene is suppressed by at least about 85%, 90%, or 95% or more by administration of an iRNA as described herein.\n\n\n \nTreatments Involving HSF1 RNAi Agents\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein in the context of HSF1 expression, the terms “treat,” “treatment,” and the like, refer to relief from or alleviation of pathological processes mediated by HSF1 expression. In the context of the present disclosure insofar as it relates to any of the other conditions recited herein below (other than pathological processes mediated by HSF1 expression), the terms “treat,” “treatment,” and the like mean to relieve or alleviate at least one symptom associated with such condition, or to slow or reverse the progression or anticipated progression of such condition, such as slowing the progression of a lipid disorder, such as atherosclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “lower” in the context of a disease marker or symptom is meant a statistically significant decrease in such level. The decrease can be, for example, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40% or more. If, for a particular disease, or for an individual suffering from a particular disease, the levels or expression of HSF1 are elevated, treatment with an HSF1 RNAi agent of the present disclosure can preferably reduce the level or expression of HSF1 to a level considered in the literature as within the range of normal for an individual without such disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe level or expression of HSF1 can be measured by evaluation of mRNA (e.g., via\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNorthern blots or PCR), or protein (e.g., Western blots). The effect of an RNAi agent on HSF1 expression can be determined by measuring HSF1 gene transcription rates (e.g., via Northern blots; or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or real-time polymerase chain reaction). RT-PCR has been used to show that mRNA levels of HSF1 are high in kidney, pancreas and prostate, and medium in liver and spleen. Brauner-Osborne et al. 2001. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1518: 237-248. Direct measurements can be made of levels of HSF1 (which is expressed by the cell surface), e.g. by Western blots of tissues in which HSF1 is expressed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the disclosure, the compositions comprising a HSF1 RNAi agent can be administered to non-human animals. For example, the compositions can be given to chickens, turkeys, livestock animals (such as sheep, pigs, horses, cattle, etc.), companion animals (e.g., cats and dogs) and can have efficacy in treatment of cancer and viral diseases. In each case, the RNAi agent to HSF1 would be selected to match the sequence of the HSF1 of the genome of the animal, and to, preferably, contain at least 1 nt mismatch from all other genes in that animal's genome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “treatment” is meant prophylaxis, therapy, cure, or any other change in a patient's condition indicating improvement or absence of degradation of physical condition. By “treatment” is meant treatment of HSF1-related disease (e.g., cancer or viral disease), or any appropriate treatment of any other ailment the patient has. As used herein, the terms “treatment” and “treat” refer to both prophylactic or preventative treatment and curative or disease-modifying treatment, including treatment of patients at risk of contracting a disease or suspected of having a disease, as well as patients already ill or diagnosed as suffering from a condition. The terms “treatment” and “treat” also refer to the maintenance and/or promotion of health in an individual not suffering from a disease but who may be susceptible to developing an unhealthy condition, such as nitrogen imbalance or muscle loss. In one embodiment, “treatment” does not encompass prevention of a disease state. Thus, the present disclosure is useful for suppressing expression of HSF1 and/or treating an HSF1-related disease in an individual afflicted by an HSF1-related disease, or an individual susceptible to an HSF1-related disease. An individual “afflicted” by an HSF1-related disease has demonstrated detectable symptoms characteristics of the disease, or had otherwise been shown clinically to have been exposed to or to carry HSF1-related disease pathogens or markers. As non-limiting examples, an individual afflicted by an HSF1-related disease can show outward symptoms; or can show no outward symptoms but can be shown with a clinical test to carry protein markers associated with an HSF1-related disease, or proteins or genetic material associated with a pathogen in the blood.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “effective amount” or a “therapeutically effective amount” is an amount that treats a disease or medical condition of an individual, or, more generally, provides a nutritional, physiological or medical benefit to an individual. As used herein, the phrases “therapeutically effective amount” and “prophylactically effective amount” refer to an amount that provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment, prevention, or management of pathological processes mediated by HSF1 expression or an overt symptom of pathological processes mediated by HSF1 expression. The specific amount that is therapeutically effective can be readily determined by an ordinary medical practitioner, and may vary depending on factors known in the art, such as, e.g., the type of pathological processes mediated by HSF1 expression, the patient's history and age, the stage of pathological processes mediated by HSF1 expression, and administration of other agents that inhibit pathological processes mediated by HSF1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments of the disclosure, the patient is at least about 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, or 75 years of age. In various embodiments, the patient is no more than about 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 90, or 100 years of age. In various embodiments the patient has a body weight of at least about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, 240, 260, 280, 300, 320, 340, 360, 380 or 400 lbs. In various embodiments, the patient has a body weight of no more than about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, 240, 260, 280, 300, 320, 340, 360, 380 or 400 lbs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments of the disclosure, the dosage [measuring only the active ingredient(s)] can be at least about 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 250, 300, 250, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950 or 1000 ng, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 250, 300, 250, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950 or 1000 micrograms, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 250, 300, 250, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950 or 1000 mg. In various embodiments, the dosage can be no more than about 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 250, 300, 250, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950 or 1000 mg. In various embodiments, the dosage can be administered at least more than once a day, daily, more than once a weekly, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, and/or every 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 months, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, the dosage is correlated to the body weight or body surface area of the individual. The actual dosage level can be varied to obtain an amount of active agent which is effective for a particular patient, composition and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected dose will depend on a variety of pharmacokinetic factors, including the activity of the particular RNAi agent employed, the route of administration, the rate of excretion of the RNAi agent, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the RNAi agent, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient, and like factors well known in the medical arts. A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine the effective amount of the RNAi agent required. A suitable dose will be that amount which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect, or a dose low enough to produce a therapeutic effect without causing side effects.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions Comprising a HSF1 RNAi Agent\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “pharmaceutical composition” comprises a pharmacologically effective amount of an iRNA and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, “pharmacologically effective amount,” “therapeutically effective amount” or simply “effective amount” refers to that amount of an iRNA effective to produce the intended pharmacological, therapeutic or preventive result. For example, if a given clinical treatment is considered effective when there is at least a 10% reduction in a measurable parameter associated with a disease or disorder, a therapeutically effective amount of a drug for the treatment of that disease or disorder is the amount necessary to effect at least a 10% reduction in that parameter. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of an iRNA targeting HSF1 can reduce HSF1 protein levels by at least 10%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a carrier for administration of a therapeutic agent. Such carriers include, but are not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The term specifically excludes cell culture medium. For drugs administered orally, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preservatives. Suitable inert diluents include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, and lactose, while corn starch and alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin, while the lubricating agent, if present, will generally be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Agents included in drug formulations are described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions comprising a HSF1 RNAi agent can be in solid form, for example, powders, granules, tablets, pills, gelcaps, gelatin capsules, liposomes, suppositories, chewable forms, or patches. The pharmaceutical compositions comprising a HSF1 RNAi agent can also be presented in liquid form, for example, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, elixirs, or syrups. Appropriate liquid supports can be, for example, water, organic solvents such as polyol, such as glycerol or glycols, including propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol, or ethanol, Cremophor EL, or mixtures thereof, in varying proportions, in water. The compositions can comprise nano-sized amorphous or crystalline granules coated with albumin or a surfactant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAppropriate supports can include, for example, antibacterial and antifungal agents, buffering agents, calcium phosphate, cellulose, methyl cellulose, chlorobutanol, cocoa butter, colorings, dextrin, emulsifiers, enteric coatings, flavorings, gelatin, isotonic agents, lecithin, magnesium stearate, perfuming agents, polyalcohols such as mannitol, injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate, paraben, phenol sorbic acid, polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidine, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), preserving agents, propylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium chloride, sorbitol, various sugars (including, but not limited to, sucrose, fructose, galactose, lactose and trehalose), starch, suppository wax, talc, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, vitamins, wax, and/or wetting agents. For HSF1 RNAi agents, a particular support comprises dextran and water, e.g. 5% dextrose in water (D5W).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biologically inert portion of the pharmaceutical composition can optionally be erodible, allowing timed release of the RNAi agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition comprising a HSF1 can be administered by buccal, inhalation (including insufflation and deep inhalation), nasal, oral, parenteral, implant, injection or infusion via epidural, intra-arterial, intra-articular, intracapsular, intracardiac, intracerebroventricular, intracranial, intradermal, intramuscular, intraorbital, intraperitoneal, intraspinal, intrasternal, intrathecal, intravenous, subarachnoid, subcapsular, subcutaneous, subcuticular, transendothelial, transtracheal, transvascular, rectal, sublingual, topical, and/or vaginal routes. This may be by injection, infusion, dermal patch, or any other method known in the art. The formulation can be powdered, nebulized, aerosolized, granulized or otherwise appropriately prepared for delivery. The administration, if liquid, may be slow or via bolus, though, under some circumstances known in the art, bolus injections may lead to loss of material through the kidneys.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HSF1 RNAi agents can be administered with medical devices known in the art. For example, in a particular specific embodiment, an RNAi agent can be administered with a needleless hypodermic injection device, such as the devices disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,163, 5,383,851, 5,312,335, 5,064,413, 4,941,880, 4,790,824, or 4,596,556. Examples of well-known implants and modules useful in the present disclosure include: U.S. Pat. No. 4,487,603, which discloses an implantable micro-infusion pump for dispensing medication at a controlled rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,486,194, which discloses a therapeutic device for administering medications through the skin; U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,233, which discloses a medication infusion pump for delivering medication at a precise infusion rate; U.S. Pat. No. 4,447,224, which discloses a variable flow implantable infusion apparatus for continuous drug delivery; U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system having multi-chamber compartments; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,475,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system. Many other such implants, delivery systems, and modules are known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, RNAi agents can be formulated to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) excludes many highly hydrophilic compounds. To ensure that the HSF1 RNAi agents cross the BBB (if desired), they can be formulated, for example, in liposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,811; 5,374,548; and 5,399,331. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties which are selectively transported into specific cells or organs, thus enhance targeted drug delivery (see, e.g., V. V. Ranade (1989) \nJ. Clin. Pharmacol. \n29: 685). Example targeting moieties include folate or biotin (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,016 to Low et al.); mannosides (Umezawa et al., (1988) \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. \n153: 1038); antibodies (P. G. Bloeman et al. (1995) \nFEBS Lett. \n357: 140; M. Owais et al. (1995) \nAntimicrob. Agents Chemother. \n39: 180); surfactant protein A receptor (Briscoe et al.

more nt (or any range thereof, e.g., 0-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4 nt, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the disclosure comprises any one or more RNAi agent listed herein.\n\n\n \nAdditional Particular Specific Embodiments\n\n\n \n \n \nCertain RNAi agents to HSF1 are disclosed in the scientific literature, e.g., in Rossi et al. 2006 Cancer Res. 66:7678-85; Dokladny et al. 2008 Am. J. Pathology 72:659-70; Jacobs et al. 2007 J. Biol. Chem. 282: 33412-20; Page et al. 2006 Mol. Biosystems 2:627-39; Zhao et al. 2007 Diabetes 56: 1436-1444; and Du et al. 2009 J. Cell. Phys. 218:631-637. The compositions of this invention do not cover these RNAi agents to the extent that they are identical in both sequence and modifications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther particular specific embodiments include compositions comprising 1, 2, 3, 4, or more of these RNAi agents. Another embodiment is a composition comprising any single RNAi agent, along with any other RNAi agents which overlap it. Another embodiment comprises two, three, four or more HSF1 RNAi agents which do not overlap and thus target different parts of the RNA molecule. When two or more RNAi agents are used, they can be administered simultaneously or sequentially.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother particular specific embodiment comprises an RNAi agent, wherein the RNAi agent comprises a sense strand comprising at least 15 contiguous nucleotides (identical in sequence) to the sense strand of any of the listed RNAi agents, and an antisense strand comprising at least 15 contiguous nucleotides (identical in sequence) to the antisense strand of the same RNAi agent. In another embodiment, the composition comprises one, two, three, four, or more such RNAi agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the composition comprises an RNAi agent which comprises an antisense strand comprising at least 15 contiguous nucleotides differing by 0, 1, 2 or 3 mismatches from the antisense strand of a RNAi agent described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the composition comprises an RNAi agent which comprises an antisense strand comprising at least 15 contiguous nucleotides differing by 0, 1, 2 or 3 mismatches from the antisense strand of a RNAi agent described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the composition comprises an RNAi agent which comprises a sense strand comprising at least 15 contiguous nucleotides differing by 0, 1, 2, or 3 mismatches from the sense strand of one of the listed RNAi agents, and an antisense strand comprising at least 15 contiguous nucleotides differing by 0, 1, 2 or 3 mismatches from the antisense strand of the same RNAi agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “mismatch” is defined herein as a difference between the base sequence or length when two sequences are maximally aligned and compared. As a non-limiting example, a mismatch is counted if a difference exists between the base at a particular location in one sequence and the base at the corresponding position in another sequence (e.g., between the sequence of a given RNAi agent and an RNAi agent listed herein). Thus, a mismatch is counted, for example, if a position in one sequence has a particular base (e.g., A), and the corresponding position on the other sequence has a different base (e.g., G, C or U). A mismatch is also counted, e.g., if a position in one sequence has a base (e.g., A), and the corresponding position on the other sequence has no base (e.g., that position is an abasic nucleotide which comprises a phosphate-sugar backbone but no base). A single-stranded nick in either sequence (or in the sense or antisense strand) is not counted as mismatch. Thus, as a non-limiting example, no mismatch would be counted if one sequence comprises the sequence A-G, but the other sequence comprises the sequence A-G with a single-stranded nick between the A and the G. A base modification is also not considered a mismatch. If one sequence comprises a C, and the other sequence comprises a modified C (e.g., with a 2′-modification) at the same position, no mismatch would be counted. Thus, modifications of a nucleotide other than replacement or alteration of the base would not constitute a mismatch. For example, no mismatch would occur between a nucleotide which is A, and a nucleotide which is A with a 5′ modification (e.g., those illustrated in \nFIG. 1\n) and/or a 2′-modification. The key feature of a mismatch (base replacement) is that it would not be able to base-pair with the corresponding base on the opposite strand. In addition, terminal overhangs such as “UU” or “dTdT” are not counted when counting the number of mismatches; the terminal “UU” and “dTdT” overhangs are also not included when calculating “15 contiguous nucleotides.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn these embodiments, a mismatch is defined as a position wherein the base of one sequence does not match the base of the other sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the composition comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, or more such RNAi agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the composition comprises an RNAi agent which comprises a sense strand comprising at least 15 contiguous nucleotides differing by 0, 1, 2 or 3 mismatches from the sense strand of one of the listed RNAi agents, and an antisense strand comprising at least 15 contiguous nucleotides differing by 0, 1, 2 or 3 mismatches from the antisense strand of the same RNAi agent\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverlapping Groups of HSF1 siRNAs\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, the disclosure relates to groups of RNAi agents with overlapping sequences. Thus, the disclosure encompasses groups of RNAi agents wherein each RNAi agent in the group overlaps with each other RNAi agent in the same group by at least 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 or more nucleotides. Particularly, in one embodiment, the overlap is at least 12 nt. Groups of sequences that overlap are shown in Table 3A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 3A shows, for example, that AD-20594 and AD-20596 share the common technical feature of the sequence of ACGUCCCGGCCU in the sense strand, and the sequence of AGGCCGGGACGU in the antisense strand. Note of course that only a 12-nt portion of the overlap is shown; many groups of RNAi agents will overlap by more than 12 nt. The position within the gene is also indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe disclosure thus encompasses various embodiments comprising groups of overlapping RNAi agents, for example (1) RNAi agents comprising the sequences of AD-20594 and AD-20596; (2) RNAi agents consisting of the sequences of AD-20594 and AD-20596; (3) RNAi agents comprising the sequences of AD-20594 and AD-20596; (4) RNAi agents comprising a sense strand and/or a antisense strand comprising a sequence of AD-20594 and AD-20596; (5) RNAi agents comprising a sense strand and/or a antisense strand comprising 15 contiguous nt with 0 to 3 mismatches from a sequence of AD-20594 and AD-20596; (6) RNAi agents comprising a sense strand comprising 15 contiguous nt with 0 to 3 mismatches from a sequence of AD-20594 and AD-20596; (7) RNAi agents comprising an antisense strand comprising 15 contiguous nt with 0 to 3 mismatches from a sequence of AD-20594 and AD-20596; etc. The disclosure also encompasses similar embodiments reflecting all the overlapping groups of RNAi agents as described in Table 3A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVariants of RNAi agents (e.g., comprising different modifications, caps, etc.) are disclosed herein, e.g., in Tables 2, 3, 9A and 9B. In these texts and tables, for example, AD-20437 shares the same sequence as AD-20437.4, though the RNAi agents differ in their modifications, caps (e.g., 5′ and/or 3′ caps), etc. However, any overlapping group comprising a RNAi agent of a given sequence also comprises any other RNAi agent which has the same sequence, but different variations in modifications, caps, etc. Thus, any group of overlapping RNAi agents that includes AD-20437 also includes AD-20437.4 and other variants of the same sequence (e.g., with different modifications, caps, etc.). More embodiments are provided herein, and are included in the scope of each RNAi agents of the disclosure.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nBioinformatics\n\n\nTranscripts\n\n\n \n \n \nOligonucleotide design was carried out to identify siRNAs targeting the gene “heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1)” from human (NCBI symbol HSF1), the orthologous sequences from rhesus monkey (\nMacaca mulatta\n), cynomolgus monkey (\nMacaca fascicularis\n), and orangutan (\nPongo pygmaeus\n). The design process used the HSF1 transcripts NM\n—\n005526.2 from human (NCBI GeneId 3297), ENSMMMUT00000020648 from rhesus (from Ensembl), internally cloned and sequenced cyno HSF1 sequences (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 2051), and ENSPPYT00000022122 from orangutan (from Ensembl). The design strategy was as follows: Begin with all perfect 19-mer human/cyno HSF1 matches. Next, expand this set with all perfect 19-mer human/orangutan/rhesus matches. Any 19-mers with mismatches to the partial cyno sequence available at the time of design were then excluded. Last, seven sequences were selected based on homology with the Novartis shRNA library. The resulting set of 512 19-mer sequences, all perfect matches to the human HSF1 gene, were then further sampled for synthesis and screening. These sequences are listed in Table 1. These sequences have not been modified.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “Position” denotes the starting position of the oligonucleotide (e.g., the 19-mer) on the transcript. This is measured in nucleotide coordinates, relative to beginning of the transcript.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHSF1

Example and non-limiting modifications of these sequences were conceived. These are listed in Tables 2 and 3. Additional modifications are contemplated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the modified sequences listed in Tables 2 and 3, some modifications were placed at sites predicted to be sensitive to endonucleases. Some modifications were designed to eliminate an immune response to the siRNA while preserving activity. In general, the sense strand was heavily modified, and the antisense strand lightly modified. Some modifications serve more than one purpose. Table 2 lists RNAi agents prepared with these modified sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubsequent to screening, a full-length HSF1 gene sequence from cynomolgus monkey was produced (see above), and used to assess identity of human/cyno 19-mer sequences. Of 406 19-mers screened for single dose efficacy in WI38 and Hela cells, 375 are perfect matches between human and cyno (e.g., zero mismatches).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE

the siRNAs listed above overlap each other in sequence. The following table presents a compilation of groups of RNAi agents, wherein each member of a group overlaps with each other member of the same group by at least 12 nt. A 12-nt portion of the overlap of the sense strands and a 12-nt portion of the overlap of the antisense strand are presented. Thus, for example, AD-20296 and AD-20300 share the common technical feature of the sequence of CCAAGCUGUGGA in the sense strand, and the sequence of UCCACAGCUUGG in the antisense strand. Note of course that only a 12-nt portion of the overlap is shown; many groups of RNAi agents will overlap by more than 12 nt. The position within the gene is also indicated.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOVERLAPPING siRNAs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n

scale synthesis is used to prepare HSF1 siRNAs; medium and large scale syntheses can also be used to prepare these siRNAs in larger quantities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSmall Scale Synthesis and Purification Methods for the Initial Screens (1 μmole Scale).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSmall scale synthesis is used to generate siRNAs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHSF1 sequences are synthesized on MerMade 192 synthesizer (BioAutomation, Plano, Tex.) at 1 μmol scale.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor all the sequences in the list, ‘endolight’ chemistry is applied as detailed below:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll pyrimidines (cytosine and uridine) in the sense strand contain 2′-O-Methyl bases (2′ O-Methyl C and 2′-O-Methyl Ti).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the antisense strand, pyrimidines adjacent to (towards 5′ position) ribo A nucleoside are replaced with their corresponding 2-O-Methyl nucleosides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA two base dTdT extension at 3′ end of both sense and antisense sequences is introduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sequence file is converted to a text file to make it compatible for loading in the MerMade 192 synthesis software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis, Cleavage and Deprotection:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis of HSF1 sequences can use solid supported oligonucleotide synthesis using phosphoramidite chemistry.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis of the above sequences is performed at 1 um scale in 96 well plates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ribo and 2-O-Methyl phosphoramidite solutions are prepared at 0.1M concentration and ethyl thio tetrazole (0.6M in Acetonitrile) is used as activator. Deblock solution, oxidizer solution and capping solution are prepared according to standard processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesized sequences are cleaved and deprotected in 96 well plates, using methylamine solution (a 3:1 mixture of aqueous and ethanolic solutions) in the first step and fluoride reagent in the second step. The crude sequences are precipitated using acetone:ethanol (80:20) mix and the pellet are re-suspended in 0.02M sodium acetate buffer. Samples from each sequence are analyzed by LC-MS to confirm the identity, UV for quantification and a selected set of samples by IEX chromatography to determine purity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification and Desalting:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHSF1 tiled sequences are purified on AKTA explorer purification system using Source 15Q column. A column temperature of 65 C is maintained during purification. Sample injection and collection are performed in 96 well (1.8 mL -deep well) plates. A single peak corresponding to the full length sequence is collected in the eluent. The purified sequences are desalted on a Sephadex G25 column using AKTA purifier. The concentration of desalted HSF1 sequences are calculated using absorbance at 260 nm wavelength and purity was measured by ion exchange chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnnealing:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurified desalted sense and antisense single strands are mixed in equimolar amounts and annealed to form HSF1 duplexes. The duplexes are prepared at 10 uM concentration in 1×PBS buffer and tested by capillary gel electrophoresis for purity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMedium Scale Synthesis and Purification (1-50 μmol)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMedium scale synthesis can also be used to generate siRNAs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle-stranded RNAs in scales between 1 and 50 μmol are prepared by solid phase synthesis using an ABI DNA/RNA Synthesizer 394 (Applied Biosystems) and controlled pore glass (CPG, 500 Å, loading 80-100 μmol/g) purchased from Prime Synthesis (Aston, Pa.) as the solid support. For larger scales, empty synthesis columns (10 mmol) from Glen Research Corp. and large amidite (80 mL) and reagent bottles (450 mL) are used. RNA and RNA containing 2′-O-methyl nucleotides are generated by solid phase synthesis employing the corresponding phosphoramidites and 2′-O-methyl phosphoramidites, respectively (ChemGenes, Wilmington, Mass.). These building blocks are incorporated at selected sites within the sequence of the oligoribonucleotide chain using standard nucleoside phosphoramidite chemistry such as described in Current Protocols in Nucleic Acid Chemistry, Beaucage, S. L. et al. (Edrs.), John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y., USA. Phosphorothioate linkages are introduced using a solution of the 0.1 M DDTT (AM Chemicals, Oceanside, Calif.) in pyridine. Further ancillary reagents are obtained from Glen Research Corp. (Sterling, Va.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDeprotection and purification of the crude oligoribonucleotides by anion exchange HPLC are carried out according to established procedures. Yields and concentrations are determined spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 260 nm. Double stranded RNA is generated by mixing an equimolar solution of complementary strands in annealing buffer (typically phosphate buffered solution, PBS, Ambion, Applied Biosystems, Austin, Tex.) at the desired concentration. The mixture is then heated in a water bath at 85-90° C. for 5 minutes and cooled to room temperature over a period of 3-4 hours. The RNA duplex is stored at −20° C. until use.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nHSF1 RNAi Agents\n\n\n \n \n \nHSF1 siRNAs are provided in Table 2, and prepared as described in Example 2. The activity of these RNAi agents is listed in Table 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 4 indicates the residual level of HSF1 expression in approximately 20,000 W138 or HeLa cells treated with 10 nM of the indicated siRNA. Expression measurements are done 24 hours after transfection. Expression is measured using RT-qRT [real-time quantitative reverse transcription]. The residual activity is normalized to HSF1 expression in Luc siRNA transfected cells, and 1.000000=100% gene expression relative to the control, or no or 0% gene knockdown; and 0.000000=0% gene expression, or complete or 100% gene knockdown in W138 or HeLa cells. A low number (closer to zero) indicates a more potent siRNA. For example, the “WI38” column for siRNA AD-20303 indicates “0.056232” meaning that the residual gene activity is 5.6%, or 94.4% gene knock-down at 10 nM. In the HeLa column, “0.098871432” indicates approximately 9.9% residual activity, or 90.1% gene knockdown at 10 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA serial dilution of the siRNAs was performed and the data curve fit to calculate the dose (concentration) required to knock down gene expression by 50% (“EC50,” or effective concentration estimated to reduce gene expression by 50%). The “EC50 Average” indicates the amount of siRNA in nM in which 50% gene knockdown is expected to be achieved; the given number is an average of two experiments. A lower number indicates a more potent siRNA. A blank cell indicates that no siRNA with that sequence was tested in that particular test, or that such data is not included herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Table 4, the suffixes “-b1”, “-b2”, etc., indicate batch numbers. Thus “b1” is from \nbatch\n 1, “b2” is from batch 2, etc. Thus, for example, “AD-20489-b1”, “AD-20489-b2” and “AD-20489” all have the same sequence and are chemically identical.\n\n\n \n

\nWI-38 or HeLa (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) cells are grown to near confluence at 37° C. in an atmosphere of 5% CO\n2 \nin RPMI or EMEM (ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS, streptomycin, and glutamine (ATCC) before being released from the plate by trypsinization. Reverse transfection is carried out by adding 5 μl of Opti-MEM to 5 μl of siRNA duplexes per well into a 96-well plate along with 10 μl of Opti-MEM plus 0.2 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMax per well (Invitrogen, Carlsbad Calif. cat #13778-150) and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. 80 μl of complete growth media without antibiotic containing 2×10\n4 \nWI-38 cells or 2.0×10\n4 \nHela cells are then added. Cells are incubated for 24 hours prior to RNA purification. Experiments are performed 10 nM final duplex concentration for WI-38 cells and at 10 nM and 0.1 nM final duplex concentration for HeLa cells for each of the HSF1 siRNAs. A subset of siRNAs that showed robust silencing in the 10 nM and 0.1 nM screens are assayed over a range of concentrations from 10 nM to 0.00005M to determine their IC50.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTotal RNA isolation using MagMAX-96 Total RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystem, Foster City Calif., part #: AM1830).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells are harvested and lysed in 140 μl of Lysis/Binding Solution then mixed for 1 minute at 850 rpm using an Eppendorf Thermomixer (the mixing speed is the same throughout the process). Twenty microliters of magnetic beads and Lysis/Binding Enhancer mixture are added into cell-lysate and mixed for 5 minutes. Magnetic beads are captured using magnetic stand and the supernatant is removed without disturbing the beads. After removal of the supernatant, magnetic beads are washed with Wash Solution 1 (isopropanol added) and mixed for 1 minute. Beads are captured again and supernatant removed. Beads are then washed with 150 μl Wash Solution 2 (Ethanol added), captured and supernatant is removed. 50 ul of DNase mixture (MagMax turbo DNase Buffer and Turbo DNase) is then added to the beads and they are mixed for 10 to 15 minutes. After mixing, 100 μl of RNA Rebinding Solution is added and mixed for 3 minutes. Supernatant is removed and magnetic beads are washed again with 150 μl Wash Solution 2 and mixed for 1 minute and supernatant is removed completely. The magnetic beads are mixed for 2 minutes to dry before RNA is eluted with 50 μl of water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncDNA synthesis is performed using ABI High capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Cat #4368813) as follows: A master mix of 2 μl 10× Buffer, 0.8 μl 25×dNTPs, 2 μl Random primers, 1 μl Reverse Transcriptase, 1 μl RNase inhibitor and 3.2 μl of H\n2\nO per reaction are added into 10 μl total RNA. cDNA is generated using a Bio-Rad C-1000 or S-1000 thermal cycler (Hercules, Calif.) through the following steps: 25° C. 10 min, 37° C. 120 min, 85° C. 5 sec, 4° C. hold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReal time PCR is performed as follows: 2 μl of cDNA are added to a master mix containing 0.5 ul GAPDH TaqMan Probe (Applied Biosystems Cat #4326317E) or 18S TaqMan Probe (Applied Biosystems Cat 44319413E), 0.5 μl HSF1 TaqMan probe (Applied Biosystems cat #HS00232134 M1) and 5 μl Roche Probes Master Mix (Roche Cat #04887301001) in a total of 10 μl per well in a LightCycler 480 384 well plate (Roche cat #0472974001). Real time PCR is done in a LightCycler 480 Real Time PCR machine (Roche). Each duplex is tested in at least two independent transfections. Each transfection is assayed in duplicate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReal time data are analyzed using the ΔΔCt method (Livak et al 2001). Each sample is normalized to GAPDH expression and knockdown is assessed relative to cells transfected with the non-targeting duplex AD-1955. IC50s are defined using a 4 parameter fit model in XLfit. See e.g., Kenneth and Schmittge. Methods 25:4, December 2001, 402-408.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nHSF1 siRNAs\n\n\n \n \n \nAs shown in Table 5, a subset of 101 HSF1 RNAi agents is presented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany of the 101 selected duplexes had >80% gene knockdown (KD) in both HeLa and WI-38 cell lines at 10 nM. Also included in the 101 are duplexes that had >80% KD in a single cell line, provided that the average KD of the two lines is >75% KD. This set also includes all duplexes that have >50% KD in WI-38 in the 0.1 nM screen. These 101 HSF1 siRNAs of particular interest are shown in Table 2. This table also presents the knockdown (KD) in HeLa and WI-38 cells when 10 nM or 0.1 nM of siRNA was used. 1.000=100% gene expression, or no or 0% gene knockdown; and 0.000=0% gene expression, or complete or 100% gene knockdown. For example, for AD-20303, the “HeLa 10 nM” column indicates “0.099”, meaning that at this concentration in these cells, the RNAi agent reduced gene expression to 9.9%, or exhibited 90.1% gene knockdown. In WI-38 cells at a concentration of 10 nM, this RNAi agent exhibited 5.6% residual gene activity, or 94.4% gene knockdown.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

The purpose of this screen was to determine the EC50 (minimum dosage of RNAi agent capable of reducing gene expression by 50%).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA serial dilution was used, comprising 12 concentrations between 10 nM and 1×10\n−5 \nnM. The siRNA duplexes were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Zhao et al. 2008 Mol. Biotech. 40: 19-26). After 24 hours total RNA is isolated and used for cDNA synthesis using random primers. 10-20 ng of total cDNA is used for TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.). Each duplex was assayed in duplicate. Data are expressed as the average-fold change compared to the non-targeting control AD-1955, which does not bind to HSF1. AD1955 is a siRNA targeting firefly luciferase and is used as a negative control siRNA in screening assays.

was determined that certain of the oligonucleotides were subject to concentration artifacts now thought to arise from incomplete thawing of plates containing the oligonucleotides. Subsequent analysis of two large datasets (unrelated to Target) indicated that any such concentration artifacts would not alter the assay results more than that which can be accounted for by normal experimental variability. Moreover, these concentration artifacts are unlikely to substantially affect our conclusions about lead selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional screening data of the HSF1 siRNAs described above is presented in Table 7, below.\n\n\n \nHSF1 Rescreen\n\n\n \n \n \nHSF1 siRNAs are rescreened to address discrepancies that are found in duplex concentrations when the single strands for these duplexes are originally annealed. 414 siRNAs are reannealed and screened at two siRNA concentrations, 10 nM and 0.1 nM. All duplexes are screened at both doses in two independent experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Vitro Screening:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell Culture and Transfections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeLa (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) cells are grown to near confluence at 37° C. in an atmosphere of 5% CO\n2 \nin EMEM (ATCC) supplemented with 10% FBS, streptomycin, and glutamine (ATCC) before being released from the plate by trypsinization. Reverse transfection is carried out by adding to 5 μl of 200 nM or 2 nM siRNA duplex per well into a 96-well plate along with 15 μl of Opti-MEM plus 0.2 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMax per well (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA. cat #13778-150) and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. 80 μl of complete growth media without antibiotic containing 2×10\n4 \nHela cells are then added resulting in a final duplex concentration of 10 nM or 0.1 nM. Cells are incubated for 24 hours prior to RNA purification.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nmRNA Isolation Using Dynobeads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad Calif. cat #610-12):\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCells are harvested and lysed in 150 μl of lysis buffer then mixed for 5 minutes at 850 rpm using and platform shaker (the mixing speed is the same throughout the process). Ten micro liters of magnetic beads that had previously been washed in 70 ul of lysis buffer are added into cell-lysate and mixed for 5 minutes. Magnetic beads are captured using magnetic stand and the supernatant is removed without disturbing the beads. Magnetic beads/RNA are washed twice with wash buffer A by adding 150 ul of buffer, shaking for 1 minute and discarding supernatant following capture of beads on magnetic stand. Beads are then washed with 150 μl wash buffer B, agitated for 1 minute, captured a magnetic bead stand and supernatant is removed. The Dynobead/mRNA mixture is then washed with 150 ul of elution buffer by shaking for 1 minute, capturing on a magnetic ring stand and discarding the elution buffer. mRNA is eluted by adding 50 ul of elution buffer and shaking for 4 minutes at 70° C. After mixing plates are placed on the magnetic bead stand for 2 minutes to recapture the beads before the supernatant containing the eluted RNA is removed to a new plate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncDNA Synthesis Using ABI High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA master mix of 1 μl 10× Buffer, 0.4 μl 25×dNTPs, 1 μl Random primers, 0.5 μl Reverse Transcriptase, 0.5 μl RNase inhibitor and 1.6 μl of H\n2\nO per reaction are added into 50 total RNA. cDNA is generated using a Bio-Rad C-1000 or S-1000 thermal cycler (Hercules, Calif.) through the following steps: 25° C. 10 min, 37° C. 120 min, 85° C. 5 sec, 4° C. hold.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReal time PCR: 2 μl of cDNA are added to a master mix containing 0.5 ul GAPDH TaqMan Probe (Applied Biosystems Cat #4326317E) or 18S Tag Man Probe (Applied Biosystems Cat #4319413E), 0.50 HSF1 TaqMan probe (Applied Biosystems cat #HS00232134M1) and 5 μl Roche Probes Master Mix (Roche Cat #04887301001) in a total of 10 μl per well in a LightCycler 480 384 well plate (Roche cat #0472974001). Real time PCR is done in a LightCycler 480 Real Time PCR machine (Roche). Each duplex is tested in at two independent transfections (Called \nScreen\n 1 and Screen 2). Each transfection is assayed in duplicate. For \nScreen\n 1 and Screen 2, qPCR is performed using GAPDH for normalization. For \nScreen\n 1, qPCR is repeated a second time using 18S for normalization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReal time data are analyzed using the ΔΔCt method (Livak et al 2001). Each sample is normalized to GAPDH or 18S expression and knockdown is assessed relative to cells transfected with the non-targeting duplex AD-1955. Higher values represent less knockdown. Reference: Analysis of Relative Gene Expression Data Using Real-Time Quantitative PCR and the 2-ΔΔCT Method. Kenneth J. Livak, Thomas D. Schmittge. Methods 25:4, December 2001, 402-408.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Table 7, below, certain HSF1 siRNAs are re-screened twice (\nScreens\n 1 and 2), using GAPDH and 18s as controls. This table also includes screening data for several HSF1 siRNAs without data presented above. Numbers represent residual HSF1 gene activity, with GAPDH or 18s as control reference genes. Thus, for example, for AD-20278-b2, “0.08” at “10 nM Screen 1 (GAPDH)” indicates 8% residual HSF1 gene activity, or 92% gene knockdown.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

estimate immunogenicity; and in vivo in Hep3B (primary liver xenograft) subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. RNAi agents are delivered in vivo in a lipid nanoparticle. Single dosages of 5 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg were delivered, and animals sacrificed and tissues collected 72 hours after dosage. The results are shown below in Table 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Duplex ID indicates the various names for the RNAi agent; AD-XXXXX/AD-XXXXX=dTdT/uu modified version of the same siRNA core sequence indicated. (XXXXX) indicates the duplex ID for the uu sequence. The Target Seq (sequence) and position in the human and cyno (cynomolgus) HSF1 genes are given; “na” indicates that the given sequence is not in the cynomolgus gene. PBMC Result (IFN-α, TNF-α) indicates whether or not a given RNAi elicited an immune response, as indicated by a measured induction of TNF-α, or IFN-α. “quiet” indicates that a given RNAi agent did not illicit an immune response. In the columns labeled “In vivo Hep3B,” the numbers indicate the percent knockdown of HSF1 expression.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

Several RNAi agents also elicited at least a 40% HSF1 expression knock-down. AD-20403/30070, AD-20437/AD-36969, AD-20438, AD-20439, AD-20487/AD-30071 (544), AD-20548, AD-20560/AD-37739 (733), AD-20562 (735), AD-20564/AD-36971,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAD-20627 (758), AD-20660 (825), AD-20707 (1330), and AD-20730 (1372) are chosen for lead optimization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\n5′-End Modifications\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example describes screening multiple chemistries to identify siRNAs that retain or improve activity relative to parent and that are potentially more stable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA two-phase approach is used. The first phase involves identifying an optimal 5′ end cap for S (sense) strand inactivation. End-caps used are: Inverted dT, L-sugar, and C-6-alkyl. These are illustrated in \nFIG. 1\n. Each cap is tested for its ability to block siRNA activity when on the 5′-end of antisense (AS) but maintain activity when on the 5′-end of the sense strand using 4 potent HSF1 siRNAs for evaluation. 1050 (EC50) in HeLa cells is determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the second phase, multiple chemical motifs are tested on a larger set of HSF1 siRNAs in context of the best 5′-end cap found in the first phase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nS (sense) modifications include the following:\n\n\n \n \nEndolight, wherein all pyrmidines are modified to 2′-OMe with 2′-OMe uu overhang, and\n\n\nAll ribonucleotides are used with 2′-OMe uu overhang.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAS modifications include:\n\n\n \n \nAll pyrimidines are modified with to 2′-OMe, with a 2′-OMe uu overhang,\n\n\nEndolight+2′-OMe on 5 3′-terminal bases with 2′-OMe uu overhang\n\n\nEndolight+2′-OMe at only pyrmidines of 5 3′ terminal bases, with 2′-OMe uu overhang.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 9A and Table 9B provide examples of 5′-end modifications contemplated within the scope of the invention. As depicted in the tables, IC50 I and IC50 II indicate the results of two determinations of IC50 (EC50). The results indicate nM concentrations.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntisense modifications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ ID\n\n\n

In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise. It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. It should also be noted that use of “or” means “and/or” unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, use of the term “including” as well as other forms, such as “include”, “includes”, and “included” is not limiting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDefinition of standard chemistry terms is found in reference works, including Carey and Sundberg “A\nDVANCED \nO\nRGANIC \nC\nHEMISTRY \n4\nTH \nED.” Vols. A (2000) and B (2001), Plenum Press, New York. Unless otherwise indicated, conventional methods of mass spectroscopy, NMR, HPLC, IR and UV/V is spectroscopy and pharmacology, within the skill of the art are employed. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclature employed in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those known in the art. Standard techniques are used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients. Reactions and purification techniques are performed e.g., using kits of manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The foregoing techniques and procedures are generally performed of conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification. Throughout the specification, groups and substituents thereof are chosen by one skilled in the field to provide stable moieties and compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulas, written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that would result from writing the structure from right to left. As a non-limiting example, —CH\n2\nO— is equivalent to —OCH\n2\n—.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise noted, the use of general chemical terms, such as though not limited to “alkyl,” “amine,” “aryl,” are equivalent to their optionally substituted forms. For example, “alkyl,” as used herein, includes optionally substituted alkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, he compounds presented herein possess one or more stereocenters. Ins some embodiments, each center exists in the R or S configuration, or combinations thereof. Likewise, in some embodiments, the compounds presented herein possess one or more double bonds. In some embodiments, each exists in the E (trans) or Z (cis) configuration, or combinations thereof. Presentation of one particular stereoisomer, regioisomer, diastereomer, enantiomer or epimer should be understood to include all possible stereoisomers, regioisomers, diastereomers, enantiomers or epimers and mixtures thereof. Thus, the compounds presented herein include all separate configurational stereoisomeric, regioisomeric, diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms as well as the corresponding mixtures thereof. For techniques regarding inverting or leaving unchanged a particular stereocenter, and those for resolving mixtures of stereoisomers see, for example, Furniss et al. (eds.), VOGEL'S TEXTBOOK OF PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 5\nth \nEdition, Longman Scientific and Technical Ltd., Essex, 1991, 809-816.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “moiety”, “chemical moiety”, “group” and “chemical group”, as used herein refer to a specific segment or functional group of a molecule. Chemical moieties are often recognized chemical entities embedded in or appended to a molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “bond” or “single bond” refers to a chemical bond between two atoms, or two moieties when the atoms joined by the bond are considered to be part of larger substructure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “catalytic group” refers to a chemical functional group that assists catalysis by acting to lower the activation barrier to reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example, “optionally substituted alkyl” means either “alkyl” or “substituted alkyl” as defined below. Further, in some embodiments, an optionally substituted group is un-substituted (e.g., —CH\n2\nCH\n3\n), fully substituted (e.g., —CF\n2\nCF\n3\n), mono-substituted (e.g., —CH\n2\nCH\n2\nF) or substituted at a level anywhere in-between fully substituted and mono-substituted (e.g., —CH\n2\nCHF\n2\n, —CH\n2\nCF\n3\n, —CF\n2\nCH\n3\n, —CFHCHF\n2\n, etc). It will be understood by those skilled in the art with respect to any group containing one or more substituents that such groups are not intended to introduce any substitution or substitution patterns (e.g., substituted alkyl includes optionally substituted cycloalkyl groups, which in turn are defined as including optionally substituted alkyl groups, potentially ad infinitum) that are sterically impractical and/or synthetically non-feasible. Thus, any substituents described should generally be understood as having a maximum molecular weight of about 1,000 daltons, and more typically, up to about 500 daltons (except in those instances where macromolecular substituents are clearly intended, e.g., polypeptides, polysaccharides, polyethylene glycols, DNA, RNA and the like).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, C1-C\nx \nincludes C\n1\n-C\n2\n, C\n1\n-C\n3 \n. . .

By way of example only, a group designated as “C\n1\n-C\n4\n” indicates that there are one to four carbon atoms in the moiety, i.e. groups containing 1 carbon atom, 2 carbon atoms, 3 carbon atoms or 4 carbon atoms, as well as the ranges C\n1\n-C\n2 \nand C\n1\n-C\n3\n. Thus, by way of example only, “C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl” indicates that there are one to four carbon atoms in the alkyl group, i.e., the alkyl group is selected from among methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, and t-butyl.

Thus, by way of example only, cyclohexane, pyridine, pyran and pyrimidine are six-membered rings and cyclopentane, pyrrole, tetrahydrofuran and thiophene are five-membered rings.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “fused” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to cyclic structures in which two or more rings share one or more bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cycloalkyl” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to an optionally substituted, saturated, hydrocarbon monoradical ring, containing from three to about fifteen ring carbon atoms or from three to about ten ring carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the term includes additional, non-ring carbon atoms as substituents (e.g. methylcyclopropyl). Whenever it appears herein, a numerical range such as “C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl” or “C\n3-6 \ncycloalkyl”, means that the cycloalkyl group consists of 3 carbon atoms, 4 carbon atoms, 5 carbon atoms or 6 carbon atoms, i.e., is cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohepty, although the present definition also covers the occurrence of the term “cycloalkyl” where no numerical range is designated. The term includes fused, non-fused, bridged and spiro radicals. A fused cycloalkyl contains from two to four fused rings where the ring of attachment is a cycloalkyl ring, and the other individual rings are alicyclic, heterocyclic, aromatic, heteroaromatic or any combination thereof. Examples include, but are not limited to cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, decalinyl, and bicyclo [2.2.1] heptyl and adamantyl ring systems. Illustrative examples include, but are not limited to the following moieties:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cycloalkenyl” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to an optionally substituted hydrocarbon non-aromatic, monoradical ring, having one or more carbon-carbon double-bonds and from three to about twenty ring carbon atoms, three to about twelve ring carbon atoms, or from three to about ten ring carbon atoms. The term includes fused, non-fused, bridged and spiro radicals. In some embodiments, a fused cycloalkenyl contains from two to four fused rings where the ring of attachment is a cycloalkenyl ring, and the other individual rings are alicyclic, heterocyclic, aromatic, heteroaromatic or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, fused ring systems are fused across a bond that is a carbon-carbon single bond or a carbon-carbon double bond. Examples of cycloalkenyls include, but are not limited to cyclohexenyl, cyclopentadienyl and bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene ring systems. Illustrative examples include, but are not limited to the following moieties:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “alicyclyl” or “alicyclic” as used herein, alone or in combination, refer to an optionally substituted, saturated, partially unsaturated, or fully unsaturated nonaromatic hydrocarbon ring systems containing from three to about twenty ring carbon atoms, three to about twelve ring carbon atoms, or from three to about ten ring carbon atoms. Thus, the terms collectively include cycloalkyl and cycloalkenyl groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “non-aromatic heterocyclyl” and “heteroalicyclyl” as used herein, alone or in combination, refer to optionally substituted, saturated, partially unsaturated, or fully unsaturated nonaromatic ring monoradicals containing from three to about twenty ring atoms, where one or more of the ring atoms are an atom other than carbon, independently selected from among oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorous, silicon, selenium and tin but are not limited to these atoms. In embodiments in which two or more heteroatoms are present in the ring, the two or more heteroatoms are the same as each another, or some or all of the two or more heteroatoms are each different from the others. The terms include fused, non-fused, bridged and spiro radicals. In some embodiments, a fused non-aromatic heterocyclic radical contains from two to four fused rings where the attaching ring is a non-aromatic heterocycle, and the other individual rings are alicyclic, heterocyclic, aromatic, heteroaromatic or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, fused ring systems are fused across a single bond or a double bond, as well as across bonds that are carbon-carbon, carbon-hetero atom or hetero atom-hetero atom. The terms also include radicals having from three to about twelve skeletal ring atoms, as well as those having from three to about ten skeletal ring atoms. In some embodiments, attachment of a non-aromatic heterocyclic subunit to its parent molecule is via a heteroatom or a carbon atom. Likewise, in some embodiments, additional substitution is via a heteroatom or a carbon atom. As a non-limiting example, an imidazolidine non-aromatic heterocycle is attached to a parent molecule via either of its N atoms (imidazolidin-1-yl or imidazolidin-3-yl) or any of its carbon atoms (imidazolidin-2-yl, imidazolidin-4-yl or imidazolidin-5-yl). In certain embodiments, non-aromatic heterocycles contain one or more carbonyl or thiocarbonyl groups such as, for example, oxo- and thio-containing groups.

Aromatic rings are formed by five, six, seven, eight, nine, or more than nine atoms. In some embodiments, aromatics are optionally substituted and are monocyclic or fused-ring polycyclic. The term aromatic encompasses both all carbon containing rings (e.g., phenyl) and those rings containing one or more heteroatoms (e.g., pyridine).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “aryl” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to an optionally substituted aromatic hydrocarbon radical of six to about twenty ring carbon atoms, and includes fused and non-fused aryl rings. In some embodiments, a fused aryl ring radical contains from two to four fused rings where the ring of attachment is an aryl ring, and the other individual rings are alicyclic, heterocyclic, aromatic, heteroaromatic or any combination thereof. Further, the term aryl includes fused and non-fused rings containing from six to about twelve ring carbon atoms, as well as those containing from six to about ten ring carbon atoms. A non-limiting example of a single ring aryl group includes phenyl; a fused ring aryl group includes naphthyl, phenanthrenyl, anthracenyl, azulenyl; and a non-fused bi-aryl group includes biphenyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “arylene” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to a diradical derived from the above-defined monoradical, aryl. Examples include, but are not limited to 1,2-phenylene, 1,3-phenylene, 1,4-phenylene, 1,2-naphthylene and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroaryl” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to optionally substituted aromatic monoradicals containing from about five to about twenty skeletal ring atoms, where one or more of the ring atoms is a heteroatom independently selected from among oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorous, silicon, selenium and tin but not limited to these atoms and with the proviso that the ring of said group does not contain two adjacent O or S atoms. In embodiments in which two or more heteroatoms are present in the ring, the two or more heteroatoms are the same as each another, or some or all of the two or more heteroatoms are each different from the others. The term heteroaryl includes optionally substituted fused and non-fused heteroaryl radicals having at least one heteroatom. The term heteroaryl also includes fused and non-fused heteroaryls having from five to about twelve skeletal ring atoms, as well as those having from five to about ten skeletal ring atoms. In some embodiments, bonding to a heteroaryl group is via a carbon atom or a heteroatom. Thus, as a non-limiting example, an imidiazole group is attached to a parent molecule via any of its carbon atoms (imidazol-2-yl, imidazol-4-yl or imidazol-5-yl), or its nitrogen atoms (imidazol-1-yl or imidazol-3-yl). Likewise, a heteroaryl group is further substituted via any or all of its carbon atoms, and/or any or all of its heteroatoms. In some embodiments, a fused heteroaryl radical contains from two to four fused rings where the ring of attachment is a heteroaromatic ring and the other individual rings are alicyclic, heterocyclic, aromatic, heteroaromatic or any combination thereof. A non-limiting example of a single ring heteroaryl group includes pyridyl; fused ring heteroaryl groups include benzimidazolyl, quinolinyl, acridinyl; and a non-fused bi-heteroaryl group includes bipyridinyl. Further examples of heteroaryls include, without limitation, furanyl, thienyl, oxazolyl, acridinyl, phenazinyl, benzimidazolyl, benzofuranyl, benzoxazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzothiadiazolyl, benzothiophenyl, benzoxadiazolyl, benzotriazolyl, imidazolyl, indolyl, isoxazolyl, isoquinolinyl, indolizinyl, isothiazolyl, isoindolyloxscliazolyl, indazolyl, pyridyl, pyridazyl, pyrimidyl, pyrazinyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazinyl, pyrazolyl, purinyl, pteridinyl, quinolinyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, thiazolyl, triazinyl, thiadiazolyl and the like, and their oxides, such as for example pyridyl-N-oxide. Illustrative examples of heteroaryl groups include the following moieties:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nand the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroarylene” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to a diradical derived from the above-defined monoradical heteroaryl. Examples include, but are not limited to pyridinyl and pyrimidinyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heterocyclyl” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers collectively to heteroalicyclyl and heteroaryl groups. Herein, whenever the number of carbon atoms in a heterocycle is indicated (e.g., C\n1\n-C\n6 \nheterocycle), at least one non-carbon atom (the heteroatom) must be present in the ring. Designations such as “C\n1\n-C\n6 \nheterocycle” refer only to the number of carbon atoms in the ring and do not refer to the total number of atoms in the ring. Designations such as “4-6 membered heterocycle” refer to the total number of atoms that are contained in the ring (i.e., a four, five, or six membered ring, in which at least one atom is a carbon atom, at least one atom is a heteroatom and the remaining two to four atoms are either carbon atoms or heteroatoms). For heterocycles having two or more heteroatoms, those two or more heteroatoms are the same or different from one another. In some embodiments, heterocycles are optionally substituted. Non-aromatic heterocyclic groups include groups having only three atoms in the ring, while aromatic heterocyclic groups must have at least five atoms in the ring. In some embodiments, bonding (i.e. attachment to a parent molecule or further substitution) to a heterocycle is via a heteroatom or a carbon atom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “carbocyclyl” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers collectively to alicyclyl and aryl groups; i.e. all carbon, covalently closed ring structures, which are saturated, partially unsaturated, fully unsaturated or aromatic. Carbocyclic rings are formed by three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or more than nine carbon atoms. Carbocycles are optionally substituted. The term distinguishes carbocyclic from heterocyclic rings in which the ring backbone contains at least one atom which is different from carbon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “halogen”, “halo” or “halide” as used herein, alone or in combination refer to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “hydroxy” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to the monoradical —OH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cyano” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to the monoradical —CN.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cyanomethyl” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to the monoradical —CH\n2\nCN.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “nitro” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to the monoradical —NO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “oxy” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to the diradical —O—.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “oxo” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to the diradical\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “carbonyl” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to the diradical —C(═O)—, which are written as —C(O)—.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “carboxy” or “carboxyl” as used herein, alone or in combination, refer to the moiety —C(O)OH, which are written as —COOH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkoxy” as used herein, alone or in combination, refers to an alkyl ether radical, —O-alkyl, including the groups —O-aliphatic and —O-carbocyclyl, wherein the alkyl, aliphatic and carbocyclyl groups is optionally substituted, and wherein the terms alkyl, aliphatic and carbocyclyl are as defined herein.

Thus, for example, the radical arylalkyl is attached to the structure in question by the alkyl group.\n\n\n \nCertain Pharmaceutical Terminology\n\n\n \n \n \nThe term “integrase inhibitor” as used herein refers to a compound that exhibits an IC\n50 \nwith respect to integrase activity, of no more than about 100 μM or not more than about 50 μM. “IC\n50\n” is that concentration of inhibitor which reduces the activity of an enzyme to half-maximal level. Compounds described herein have been discovered to exhibit inhibition against integrase. Compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) preferably exhibit an IC\n50 \nwith respect to integrase of no more than about 10 μM, more preferably, no more than about 5 μM, even more preferably not more than about 1 μM, and most preferably, not more than about 200 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “subject”, “patient” or “individual” as used herein in reference to individuals suffering from a disorder, and the like, encompasses mammals and non-mammals. None of the terms requires the supervision of a medical professional (e.g., a doctor, nurse, orderly, physician's assistant, hospice worker) Mammals are any member of the Mammalian class, including but not limited to humans, non-human primates such as chimpanzees, and other apes and monkey species; farm animals such as cattle, horses, sheep, goats, swine; domestic animals such as rabbits, dogs, and cats; laboratory animals including rodents, such as rats, mice and guinea pigs, and the like. Examples of non-mammals include, but are not limited to, birds, fish and the like. In some embodiments of the methods and compositions provided herein, the subject is a mammal. In preferred embodiments, the subject is a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “treat,” “treating” or “treatment,” and other grammatical equivalents as used herein, include alleviating, abating or ameliorating a disease or condition symptoms, preventing additional symptoms, ameliorating or preventing the underlying metabolic causes of symptoms, inhibiting the disease or condition, e.g., arresting the development of the disease or condition, relieving the disease or condition, causing regression of the disease or condition, relieving a condition caused by the disease or condition, or stopping the symptoms of the disease or condition, and are intended to include prophylaxis. The terms further include achieving a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated. Also, a therapeutic benefit is achieved with the eradication or amelioration of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that an improvement is observed in the patient, notwithstanding that the patient is still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For prophylactic benefit, the compositions are administered to a patient at risk of developing a particular disease, or to a patient reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though a diagnosis of this disease has not been made.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “administer,” “administering”, “administration,” and the like, as used herein, refer to the methods that are used to enable delivery of compounds or compositions to the desired site of biological action. These methods include, but are not limited to oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), topical and rectal administration. In preferred embodiments, the compounds and compositions described herein are administered orally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “effective amount”, “therapeutically effective amount” or “pharmaceutically effective amount” as used herein, refer to a sufficient amount of at least one agent or compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disease or condition being treated. In some embodiments, the result is reduction and/or alleviation of the signs, symptoms, or causes of a disease, or any other desired alteration of a biological system. For example, an “effective amount” for therapeutic uses is the amount of the composition comprising a compound as disclosed herein required to provide a clinically significant decrease in a disease. In some embodiments, an appropriate “effective” amount differs from one individual to another. An appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case is determined using any suitable technique, such as a dose escalation study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “acceptable” as used herein, with respect to a formulation, composition or ingredient, means having no persistent detrimental effect on the general health of the subject being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable” as used herein, refers to a material, such as a carrier or diluent, which does not abrogate the biological activity or properties of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), and is relatively nontoxic, i.e., the material is administered to an individual without causing undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the components of the composition in which it is contained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “prodrug” as used herein, refers to a drug precursor that, following administration to a subject and subsequent absorption, is converted to an active, or a more active species via some process, such as conversion by a metabolic pathway. Thus, the term encompasses any derivative of a compound, which, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) or a pharmaceutically active metabolite or residue thereof. Some prodrugs have a chemical group present on the prodrug that renders it less active and/or confers solubility or some other property to the drug. Once the chemical group has been cleaved and/or modified from the prodrug the active drug is generated. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they are easier to administer than the parent drug. In some embodiments, they are, for instance, bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. Particularly favored derivatives or prodrugs are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) when such compounds are administered to a patient (e.g. by allowing an orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a biological compartment (e.g. the brain or lymphatic system).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” as used herein, refers to salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free acids and bases of the specified compound and that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. In some embodiments, compounds described herein possess acidic or basic groups and therefore react with any of a number of inorganic or organic bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. These salts are prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), or by separately reacting a purified compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutical composition,” as used herein, refers to a biologically active compound, optionally mixed with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable chemical component, such as, though not limited to carriers, stabilizers, diluents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, excipients and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “carrier” as used herein, refers to relatively nontoxic chemical compounds or agents that facilitate the incorporation of a compound into cells or tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “pharmaceutical combination”, “administering an additional therapy”, “administering an additional therapeutic agent” and the like, as used herein, refer to a pharmaceutical therapy resulting flow the mixing or combining of more than one active ingredient and includes both fixed and non-fixed combinations of the active ingredients. The term “fixed combination” means that at least one of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), and at least one co-agent, are both administered to a patient simultaneously in the form of a single entity or dosage. The term “non-fixed combination” means that at least one of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), and at least one co-agent, are administered to a patient as separate entities either simultaneously, concurrently or sequentially with variable intervening time limits, wherein such administration provides effective levels of the two or more compounds in the body of the patient. These also apply to cocktail therapies, e.g. the administration of three or more active ingredients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “co-administration”, “administered in combination with” and their grammatical equivalents or the like, as used herein, are meant to encompass administration of the selected therapeutic agents to a single patient, and are intended to include treatment regimens in which the agents are administered by the same or different route of administration or at the same or different times. In some embodiments a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) will be co-administered with other agents. These terms encompass administration of two or more agents to an animal so that both agents and/or their metabolites are present in the animal at the same time. They include simultaneous administration in separate compositions, administration at different times in separate compositions, and/or administration in a composition in which both agents are present. Thus, in some embodiments, the compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) and the other agent(s) are administered in a single composition. In some embodiments, compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) and the other agent(s) are admixed in the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “metabolite,” as used herein, refers to a derivative of a compound which is formed when the compound is metabolized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “active metabolite,” as used herein, refers to a biologically active derivative of a compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “metabolized,” as used herein, refers to the sum of the processes (including, but not limited to, hydrolysis reactions and reactions catalyzed by enzymes) by which a particular substance is changed by an organism. Thus, in certain instances, enzymes produce specific structural alterations to a compound. For example, cytochrome P450 catalyzes a variety of oxidative and reductive reactions while uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransfemses catalyze the transfer of an activated glucuronic-acid molecule to aromatic alcohols, aliphatic alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines and free sulphydryl groups.

Protecting groups are used to block some or all reactive moieties and prevent such groups from participating in chemical reactions until the protective group is removed. It is preferred that each protective group be removable by a different means. Protective groups that are cleaved under totally disparate reaction conditions fulfill the requirement of differential removal. Protective groups are removed by acid, base, and hydrogenolysis. Groups such as trityl, dimethoxytrityl, acetal and t-butyldimethylsilyl are acid labile and are used to protect carboxy and hydroxy reactive moieties in the presence of amino groups protected with Cbz groups, which are removable by hydrogenolysis, and Fmoc groups, which are base labile. Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties are blocked with base labile groups such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl in the presence of amines blocked with acid labile groups such as t-butyl carbamate or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties are blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids are blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties are protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as exemplified herein, or they are blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups are blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAllyl blocking groups are useful in then presence of acid- and base-protecting groups since the former are stable and are subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid are deprotected with a Pd-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate is attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and cannot react. Once released from the resin, the functional group is available to react.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtecting or blocking groups are selected from:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther protecting groups, plus a detailed description of techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal are described in Greene and Wuts, P\nROTECTIVE \nG\nROUPS IN \nO\nRGANIC \nS\nYNTHESIS\n, 3\nrd \nEdition (John Wiley and Sons, 1999), and Kocienski, P\nROTECTIVE \nG\nROUPS \n(Thieme Verlag, 1994), which are incorporated herein by reference for such subject matter.\n\n\n \nPreparing Compounds of Formula (I) or (II); Formula (III) or (IV); or Formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c)\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are processes for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c).

In some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) possesses one or more double bonds. Compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) include all cis, trans, syn, anti, entgegen (E), and zusammen (Z) isomers as well as the corresponding mixtures thereof. In some situations, compounds exist as tautomers. Compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) include all possible tautomers within the formulas described herein. In some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) possesses one or more chiral centers and each center exists in the R or S configuration. Compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) include all diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric forms as well as the corresponding mixtures thereof. In additional embodiments of the compounds and methods provided herein, mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereoisomers, resulting from a single preparative step, combination, or interconversion are useful for the applications described herein. Compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) are prepared as their individual stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. While resolution of enantiomers is carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), dissociable complexes are preferred (e.g., crystalline diastereomeric salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubilities, reactivity, etc.) and are readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities. In some embodiments, the diastereomers are separated by chiral chromatography, or preferably, by separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer is then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in racemization. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from their racemic mixture is found in Jacques et al, “E\nNANTIOMERS\n, R\nACEMATES AND \nR\nESOLUTIONS\n” (John Wiley And Sons, 1981), herein incorporated by reference for such subject matter.\n\n\n \nLabeled Compounds of Formula (I) or (II); Formula (III) or (IV): or Formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c)\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) exist in their isotopically-labeled forms. Disclosed herein are, in certain instances, are methods of treating diseases by administering such isotopically-labeled compounds. Further disclosed herein are methods of treating diseases by administering such isotopically-labeled compounds as pharmaceutical compositions. Thus, compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) also include isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that are incorporated into compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine and chloride, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\n0, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, and \n36\nCl, respectively. Compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, prodrugs, solvate, hydrates or derivatives thereof which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this disclosure. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as \n3\nH and \n14\nC are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., \n3\nH and carbon-14, i.e., \n14\nC) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavy isotopes such as deuterium, i. e., \n2\nH, affords certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, are preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug, solvate, hydrate or derivative thereof are generally prepared by carrying out procedures described herein, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is labeled by other means, including, but not limited to, the use of chromophores or fluorescent moieties, bioluminescent labels, or chemiluminescent labels.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutically Acceptable Salts of Compounds of Formula (I) or (II); Formula (III) or (IV): or Formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c)\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) exists as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.

Disclosed herein, in certain instances, are methods of treating diseases by administering such solvates. Further disclosed herein, in certain instances, are methods of treating diseases by administering such solvates as pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. In some embodiments, solvates of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) are prepared or formed during the processes described herein. By way of example only, hydrates of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) are prepared by recrystallization from an aqueous/organic solvent mixture, using organic solvents including, but not limited to, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran or methanol.

Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. In some embodiments, polymorphs have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature affect which crystal or crystals dominate.\n\n\n \nProdrugs of Compounds of Formula (I) or (II); Formula (III) or (IV); or Formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c)\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) exists in prodrug form. Disclosed herein, in certain instances, are methods of treating diseases by administering such prodrugs. Further disclosed herein, in certain instances, are methods of treating diseases by administering such prodrugs as pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrugs are generally drug precursors that, following administration to a subject and subsequent absorption, are converted to an active, or a more active species via some process, such as conversion by a metabolic pathway. Some prodrugs have a chemical group present on the prodrug that renders it less active and/or confers solubility or some other property to the drug. Once the chemical group has been cleaved and/or modified from the prodrug the active drug is generated. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they are easier to administer than the parent drug. For example, prodrugs are bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. In some embodiments, the prodrug has improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound as described herein which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyamino acid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art. (See for example Bundgaard, “Design and Application of Prodrugs” in \nA Textbook of Drug Design and Development\n, Krosgaard-Larsen and Bundgaard, Ed., 1991, Chapter 5, 113-191, which is incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, prodrugs are designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. The design of prodrugs to date has been to increase the effective water solubility of the therapeutic compound for targeting to regions where water is the principal solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, in some embodiments, prodrug derivatives of compounds described herein are prepared by any suitable method (for further details see Saulnier et al., \nBioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, \n1994, 4, 1985).

In human metabolism, the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of enzymes is the most important contributor to oxidative metabolism. Hepatic CYP enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many drug substances, and in particular, CYP3A4 is noteworthy for its wide range of substrates and high expression in the liver. Facile CYP3A4 metabolism often results is low serum levels of drug substance. In some embodiments, compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) are not significantly degraded or metabolized by CYP3A4, and are thus of particular interest as therapeutics. The term “significantly degraded” as used in this context, should be understood to refer to a compound that upon administration to a subject would not require the aid of a CYP inhibitor to boost serum concentrations. In some embodiments, the degree of CYP3A4 degradation is determined by any suitable method. One such assay is described herein and thus the degree of degradation is measured by exposing a compound to pooled human liver microsomes (protein: 1 mg/mL with CYP3A4 activity at about 4000 pmol/min/mg) at 37° C. for 60 minutes at pH 7.4 at a compound concentration of 1 μM in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM) containing magnesium chloride (5 mM), EDTA (100 μM) and NADPH (1 mM). The activity of the CYP3A4 enzyme is usually determined separately, in a standard assay, prior to performing the degradation assay. (Indeed it is often provided as part of the spec sheet by the enzyme supplier. It should be noted that in this assay an average CYP3A4 activity is given). Alternatively, in some embodiments, an isolated enzyme assay is performed and thus the degree of degradation is measured by exposing a compound to 10 pmol CYP3A4 enzyme at 37° C. for 60 minutes at pH 7.4 in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM) containing magnesium chloride (5 mM), EDTA (100 μM) and NADPH (1 mM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in some embodiments, compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) are less than about 30% degraded after exposure to pooled human liver microsomes (protein: 1 mg/mL with CYP3A4 activity at about 7800 pmol/min/mg) at 37° C. for 60 minutes at pH 7.4 at a compound concentration of 1 μM in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM) containing magnesium chloride (5 mM), EDTA (100 μM) and NADPH (1 mM). In further or additional embodiments, compounds of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) are less than about 30% degraded after exposure to 10 pmol CYP3A4 enzyme at 37° C. for 60 minutes at pH 7.4 in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM) containing magnesium chloride (5 mM), EDTA (100 μM) and NADPH (1 mM).\n\n\n \nDiseases\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are methods of treating a disease in an individual suffering from said disease comprising administering to said individual an effective amount of a composition comprising a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method of treating or preventing HIV infection, treating AIDS-related complex (ARC), prophylaxis of ARC, delaying the onset of ARC, treating AIDS, prophylaxis of AIDS or delaying the onset of AIDS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso described herein are methods of preventing or delaying onset of a disease in an individual at risk for developing said disease comprising administering to said individual an effective amount to prevent or delay onset of said disease, of a composition comprising a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods disclosed herein also encompass the prophylaxis or treatment of any disease or disorder in which HIV integrase plays a role including, without limitation, HIV integrase in a human or other mammal.

In some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is used to treat infections or conditions associated with viruses, including, for example, human immunodeficiency viruses 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) including drug resistant strains, human T-cell leukemia viruses 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human papilloma virus (HPV), adenovirus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8, also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus) and flaviviruses, including Yellow Fever virus, Dengue virus, Japanese Encephalitis and West Nile viruses. Preferably, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof is used to treat HIV infections. In addition, the present compounds are used to prevent and/or reduce the likelihood of a viral infection such as an 111V infection or a condition which that occurs secondary to a viral infection, such as AIDS, EBV-related lymphoma or HHV-8 associated cancer (sarcoma) will actually occur.\n\n\n \nHIV and AIDS\n\n\n \n \n \nOver 40 million individuals worldwide are currently infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with over 14,000 new infections daily and 3 million deaths annually from HIV-related causes. While advances in HIV and AIDS therapy have resulted in fewer AIDS related deaths, the number of HIV-infected individuals continues to rise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), particularly type-1 (HIV-1) and type-2 (HIV-2) strains, is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Individuals infected with HIV are initially asymptomatic but eventually undergo the gradual destruction of the immune system, (particularly CD4\n+ \nT-cells), with a resultant debilitating and ultimately fatal susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Prior to the onset of AIDS, infected individuals MAY experience a precursor AIDS-related complex (ARC), a syndrome characterized by symptoms such as persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, fever and weight loss.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReplication of HIV in a host cell requires integration of the HIV genome into the host cell's DNA. Upon completion of this integration event, integrated proviral DNA is then translated using host cell machinery into viral proteins. Viral protein precursors are then processed by the viral protease to produce the protease, reverse transcriptase, endonuclease/integrase and mature structural proteins of the virus core.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntegration of the HIV genome into the host cell's DNA is performed by the HIV integrase enzyme. HIV integrase has two known enzymatic functions. The enzyme performs 3′-end processing in which two deoxynucleotides are removed from the 3′ ends of the viral DNA. In addition, HIV integrase performs the strand transfer reaction in which the processed 3′ ends of the viral DNA are covalently ligated to the host chromosomal DNA. Clearly, compounds that inhibit HIV integration will inhibit HIV replication in infected cells and would thus be useful in the treatment of HIV infection. In addition, compounds that inhibit HIV integration will prevent HIV infection in uninfected, normal cells and would thus be useful in the prophylaxis of HIV infection.\n\n\n \nCombination Therapy\n\n\n \n \n \nThe development of resistance to a single HIV therapy occurs. In certain instances, the administration of a combination of anti-HIV medications is utilized to suppress HIV replication. In certain instances, an individual receives a nucleoside-type reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor, typically in combination. HIV treatment now includes combination therapies (drug cocktails) that involve the dual administration of NRTIs with protease inhibitors or NNRTIs with protease inhibitors and triple combinations of NRTIs, NNRTIs and protease inhibitors. In some embodiments, an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered in combination with other HIV inhibitors selected from NRTIs, NNRTIs or protease inhibitors.\n\n\n \nMetabolism and Pharmacokinetic Profile\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the metabolic profile of a compound influence the ability of the compound to serve as a useful and convenient medication. In human metabolism, the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family of enzymes is the most important contributor to oxidative metabolism. Hepatic CYP enzymes are involved in the metabolism of thousands of substrates, including toxic compounds and drug substances. In particular, CYP3A4 is noteworthy for its wide range of substrates and high expression in the liver. As a result, CYP3A4 metabolism is commonly encountered in the development of small molecule drugs. Facile CYP3A4 metabolism often results is low serum levels of drug substance. To achieve efficacy, a readily metabolized drug substance must then be given at higher doses and at shorter intervals. This results in a greater likelihood of drug toxicity and reduced patient compliance. One potential solution to this problem is the co-administration of a CYP3A4 inhibitor to boost the serum levels of the drug substance. However, this potential solution introduces the complexity of a second pharmacological agent and the attendant issues of toxicity, undesired pharmacology, drug-drug interactions and increased burden on the patient. For disease indications requiring combination therapy, the metabolic fate of the other components of the combination therapy must also be considered. In some embodiments, an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered without the aid of a CYP inhibitor to boost serum concentrations. In some embodiments, an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered in combination with other HIV inhibitors selected from NRTIs, NNRTIs or protease inhibitors, without the aid of a CYP inhibitor to boost serum concentrations.\n\n\n \nModes of Administration and Dosage Forms\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the compounds and compositions described herein are administered either alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents, in a pharmaceutical composition, according to standard pharmaceutical practice.

Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents are a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethylene-oxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived fi mil fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. In some embodiments, an aqueous suspensions contains one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers, water and various organic solvents. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. In some embodiments, tablets containing various excipients, such as citric acid are employed together with various disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates and with binding agents such as sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tableting purposes. In some embodiments, solid compositions of a similar type are employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials, therefore, include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. In some embodiments, when aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the active compound therein is combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matters or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, oily suspensions are formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. In some embodiments, the oily suspensions contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. In some embodiments, sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents are added to provide a palatable oral preparation. In some embodiments, these compositions are preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as butylated hydroxyanisol or alpha-tocopherol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. In some embodiments, additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, are present. In some embodiments, these compositions are preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions are in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. In some embodiments, the oily phase is a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these.

Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that are employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In some embodiments, the sterile injectable preparation is also a sterile injectable oil-in-water microemulsion where the active ingredient is dissolved in the oily phase. For example, the active ingredient is first dissolved in a mixture of soybean oil and lecithin. The oil solution then introduced into a water and glycerol mixture and processed to form a microemulsion. In some embodiments, the injectable solutions or microemulsions are introduced into a patient's blood-stream by local bolus injection. Alternatively, it is advantageous to administer the solution or microemulsion in such a way as to maintain a constant circulating concentration of the instant compound. In some embodiments, a continuous intravenous delivery device is utilized. An example of such a device is the Deltec CADD-PLUS™ model 5400 intravenous pump. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension for intramuscular and subcutaneous administration. Suspensions are formulated using any suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. In some embodiments, a sterile injectable preparation is a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. In some embodiments, sterile, fixed oils are employed as a solvent or suspending medium. Any bland fixed oil is employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions are also administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. In some embodiments, these compositions are prepared by mixing the active ingredient with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered are used. As used herein, topical application includes mouth washes and gargles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions are administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles and delivery devices, or via transdermal routes, using for example transdermal skin patches. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the formulations are presented in unit dosage form and are prepared by any of the methods well known in the all of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug or solvate thereof (“active ingredient”) with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a specific amount of active compound are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the compounds and compositions described herein may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question.\n\n\n \nDoses\n\n\n \n \n \nThe amount of pharmaceutical composition administered depends on a variety of factors. The amount will firstly be dependent on the mammal being treated. In the instances where pharmaceutical compositions are administered to a human subject, the daily dosage will normally be determined by the prescribing physician with the dosage generally varying according to the age, sex, diet, weight, general health and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, the precise indication or condition being treated, the severity of the indication or condition being treated, time of administration, route of administration, the disposition of the composition, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the discretion of the prescribing physician. In some embodiments, the route of administration varies depending on the condition and its severity. Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition is in unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small amounts until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. In some embodiments, the total daily dosage is divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. The amount and frequency of administration of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), and if applicable other therapeutic agents and/or therapies, is regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician (physician) considering such factors as described above. In some embodiments, administration occurs in an amount of between about 0.001 mg/kg of body weight to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day (administered in single or divided doses), more preferably at least about 0.1 mg/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, a therapeutic dosage is, e.g., from about 0.01 mg to about 7000 mg of compound, and preferably includes, e.g., from about 0.05 mg to about 2500 mg. In some embodiments, the quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation is varied or adjusted from about 0.1 mg to 1000 mg, preferably from about 1 mg to 300 mg, more preferably 10 mg to 200 mg, according to the particular application. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range are used, while in other cases larger doses are employed without causing any harmful side effect, e.g. by dividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day. The amount administered will vary depending on the particular IC\n50 \nvalue of the compound used. In combinational applications in which the compound is not the sole therapy, in some embodiments, it is possible to administer lesser amounts of compound and still have therapeutic or prophylactic effect.\n\n\n \nCombination Therapies\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof is administered as a sole therapy. In some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof is administered in combination with another therapy or therapies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant may only have minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient is increased by administering one of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) with a second therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. By way of example only, in a treatment for viral infection involving administration of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), increased therapeutic benefit results by providing the patient with another therapeutic agent for viral infection. Or, by way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is nausea, then it is appropriate to administer an anti-nausea agent in combination with the compound. Additional therapy or therapies include, but are not limited to physiotherapy, psychotherapy, radiation therapy, application of compresses to a diseased area, rest, altered diet, and the like. Regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient is additive of the two therapies or therapeutic agents, or the patient experiences a synergistic benefit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the instances where a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered with other therapeutic agents, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) need not be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition as other therapeutic agents. In some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered by a different route. For example, the compounds/compositions are administered orally to generate and maintain good blood levels thereof, while the other therapeutic agent are administered intravenously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) is administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol), sequentially or dosed separately to other therapeutic agents. In some embodiments, the administration of a compound of formula (I) or formula (II), or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof and the second therapeutic agent is sequential. In some embodiments, the sequential administration is a cycling therapy. In some embodiments, the compound of formula (I) or formula (II), is administered before the second therapeutic agent. In some embodiments, the compound of formula (I) or formula (II), is administered after the second therapeutic agent. In some embodiments, the administration of a compound of formula (I) or formula (II), or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof and the second therapeutic agent is simultaneous.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe determination of the timing and mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is within the knowledge of the skilled clinician. In some embodiments, the initial administration is made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration is modified by the skilled clinician. The particular choice of compound and other therapeutic agent will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof are administered in combination with an anti HIV or AIDS drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof are administered in combination with a reverse transcriptase inhibitors, viral protease inhibitors, cytokines, cytokine inhibitors, glycosylation inhibitors, viral mRNA processing inhibitors, entry inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, maturation inhibitors or a combination of two or more thereof. In some embodiments, a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c) or a metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof are administered in combination with adefovir, abacavir, amprenavir, atazanavir, apricitabine, bevirimat, darunavir, delavirdine, didanosine, efavirenz, emtricitabine, elvitegravir, enfuvirtide, etravirine, fosamprenavir, fuseon, indinavir, lamivudine, lopinavir, maraviroc, nelfinavir, nevirapine, racivir, raltegravir, reverset, ritonavir, saquinavir, stavudine, tenofovir, tipranavir, vicriviroc, zalcitabine, zidovudine, interferon-α, interferon-β or interferon-γ, or a combination of two or more thereof.\n\n\n \nKits\n\n\n \n \n \nA compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), compositions and methods described herein provide kits for the treatment of disorders, such as the ones described herein.

Experimental procedures were essentially as previously published (see Connor et al., \nJournal of Virology, \n1996, 70, 5306-5311: Characterization of the functional properties of env genes from long-term survivors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection, and Popik et al., \nJournal of Virology, \n2002, 76, 4709-4722: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 uses lipid raft-co-localized CD4 and chemokine receptors for productive entry into CD4+ T cells). Virus stocks were generated by co-transfection of plasmid DNA encoding VSV-G with vector pNL4-3Env(−)Luc(+) into 293T cells. Sixty-four hours after transfection, virus-containing medium was collected by centrifugation and stored frozen at −80° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHeLa cells were infected with the VSV-G pseudotyped virus in the presence of screening compounds in a 384-well or 96-well microtiter plate format. Forty-eight hours after initial infection, Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) was added to the cells and luciferase activity was determined using a LJLAnalyst luminometer. As the luciferase gene is carried in the virus genome, its expression level reflects the virus replication level in the presence of a compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo evaluate the activity of the compounds against wild type HIV-1, the HeLa-JC53 cell line that expresses high levels of CD4 and CCR5 (see for example, Platt et al., \nJournal of Virology \n1998, 72, 2855-2864: Effect of CCR5 and CD4 cell surface concentrations on infection by macrophagetropic isolates of human immunodeficiency virus type 1) was modified by isolation of a stable cell line that expresses luciferase under the control of the HIV-1 promoter (long terminal repeat, i.e., LTR). HIV-1 infection of this cell line stimulates the transcription of luciferase from the HIV-1 promoter and the luciferase gene expression level is proportional to the level of virus replication (Harrington et al., \nJournal of Virology Methods, \n2000, 88, 111-115: Direct detection of infection of HIV-1 in blood using a centrifugation-indicator cell assay; and Roos et al., \nVirology, \n2000, 273, 307-315: LuSIV cells: a reporter cell line for the detection and quantitation of a single cycle of HIV and SIV replication). Procedures for virus infection, compound testing and luciferase activity determination were the same as for the VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo approaches have been used to evaluate cytotoxicity. The first employed another modified HeLa-JC53 cell line that constitutively expresses high levels of luciferase without virus infection. The level of luciferase expression in these cells serves as an indicator for cell replication in the presence of the compounds. Procedures for compound testing and luciferase activity determination are the same as for the virus infection tests. The other toxicity assay utilizes HeLe-JC53 cells and a commercially available cell viability assay kit (Promega) that measures the ATP levels in the cells.\n\n\n \nExample 32\n\n\nActivity Data for

33\n\n\nMicrosomal Incubation (Method 1)\n\n\n \n \n \nCompound (10 μM) was incubated with rat, dog, cynomolgus monkey, and human liver microsomes (1 mg protein/mL) in a final volume of 1 mL in 2-mL Eppendorf tubes. The mixture containing enzymes, potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4), and the compound was pre-incubated at 37° C. for 3 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NADPH (final concentration of 1 mM) and incubated for 60 minutes at 37° C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 mL of acetonitrile. After centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 3 minutes, the supernatant was subjected to 15 minutes of concentration (N2 flow, 32° C.). The resulting final extract was transferred to clean vials and analyzed by HPLC.\n\n\n \nExample 34\n\n\nHevatocytes Incubation (Method 1)\n\n\n \n \n \nCryopreserved hepatocytes were thawed in a water bath at 37° C. and transferred to a 50-mL tube containing 45 mL of pre-warmed incubation medium (In VitroGRO HT medium). The tube was inverted 3 times to ensure resuspension of hepatocytes and centrifuged at 50 g at room temperature for 5 minutes. The supernatant was decanted without disturbing the pellet. The pellet of hepatocytes was resuspended in 1 mL of William's E medium and the viable cell counting was determined by the tryptan blue exclusion method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe William's E medium was added to the suspension of the hepatocytes pellet to make a final density of 2 million cells/mL. Stock solution of the compound was prepared at the concentration of 1 mM and diluted to 10 μM with William's E medium. The culture plate was incubated at 37° C. under 5% carbon dioxide and 95% air atmosphere for 2 hrs. The metabolic reaction was terminated by transferring the contents of the well into a centrifuge tube containing 1 mL of 0.1% TFAA acetonitrile solution and then vortexing. After centrifugation, the supernatant was subjected to 15 minute of concentration (N2 flow, 32° C.).

The vials were immediately immersed in a 37° C. water bath and gently rocked back and forth until most of the ice was melted and the pellet was completely mixed, (note, care was taken to maintain temperature below 37° C. during this step as the cryo-preservative is cytotoxic at 37° C.) 1 vial of hepatocytes was added to each 25 mL tube of incubation media, and the cells resuspended by gently inverting the tube several times. The cell suspension was centrifuged (468 rpm, 5 mins, ˜25° C.), and the supernatant discarded using a 5 mL pipette, being careful not to disturb the pellet during aspiration. A moderate amount of media was left with the pellet, which was loosened by tipping and gently rolling the tube until the pellet was gone. Incubation media (2 mL, CO\n2 \nbubbled) was added to each tube and the hepatocytes re-suspended by rocking the tube. The total cell count was then determined (see Trypan Blue Exclusion Method described below). The cells were resuspended in the appropriate amount of incubation media to yield 1.25×10\n6 \nviable cells/mL. The final concentration of cells in the incubation was 1.0×10\n6 \nafter the addition of the compound stock solution.\n\n\n \nTrypan Blue Exclusion Method\n\n\n \n \n \n800 μL of incubation media, 100 μL of Trypan Blue solution and 100 μL of the cell suspension were mixed in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. 10 μL of the suspension was applied to the hemacytometer using a wide bore pipette tip. Living (yellow) and dead (blue) cells were counted in 4 quadrants of the hemacytometer. The total number of cells/mL and cell viability (living cells/total cells) were calculated, as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \nTotal cells/mL=living cells×0.25×10×10\n4 [\n0.25=¼ quadrants counted; 10=dilution factor]\n\n\n\n \nTime Course Incubation\n\n\n \n \n \nHepatocytes (40 uL) were added to each tube using wide orifice pipette tips to a final concentration of 1 million cells/mL. Test compound solution (10 μL of 5 uM) was aliquoted into the appropriate tubes, and the incubated (37° C., CO2 incubator uncapped) for 4 hours. Samples were then quenched with internal standard in acetonitrile (200 uL of 100 ng/mL), vortexed (1-2 mins) and centrifuged (10 minutes, 3000 rpm). The supernatant was removed for LC-MS/MS analysis (instrument—MDS-Analyst, API 4000, S/N: J3750206, Agilent 1100, Binary Pump G1312A, S/N DE14910504; HPLC Column—Atlantis dC18 3 um, 4.6×50 mm, P/N: 186001329).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHepatocytes (human and rat, X00801 and M00005 respectively), buffer (InVitro Gro Buffer, Z99074) and medium (Invitro Gro HT, Z99019) were obtained from Celsis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelect compounds prepared as described herein, were assayed for stability according to the biological procedures described above, and the results are given in the table below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% Remaining\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEg\n\n\nStructure\n\n\n(human)\n\n\n% Remaining (rat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2V\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n97\n\n\n82\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n20AA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n75\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n20NN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n30A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 37\n\n\nMetabolic Stability\n\n\n \n \n \nRecombinant enzymes: Microsomes from baculovirus-infected insect enzymes cells (Supersomes) expressing CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, 3A5, FMO3 and insect cell controls are obtained from BD Biosciences (Gentest Co).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound (1 μM) or a positive control (1 μM) are incubated with individual recombinant enzymes (10 pmol) in a final volume of 500 μL. The mixture of enzymes containing potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4), MgCl\n2 \n(5 mM), EDTA (100 μM), and compound or positive control are pre-incubated at 37° C. for 3 minutes. Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 8) is used for FMO3 incubation without pre-incubation. The reaction is then initiated by the addition of NADPH (final concentration: 1 mM) and incubated at 37° C. for 60 minutes. The reaction is terminated by addition of 200 μL of acidified acetonitrile containing an internal standard or only acetonitrile for the positive controls. After centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 10 minutes, 200 μL of the supernatant are transferred to a clean 96-well plate and analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The positive controls used are: 7-ethoxyresorufin (CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP1B1), coumarin (CYP2A6), selegiline (CYP2B6), diclofenac (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), bufuralol (CYP2D6) and testosterone (CYP3A4). P-nitrophenol is incubated with CYP2E1 (50 pmol) at a concentration of 500 μM for 20 minutes to assess the activity of the enzyme. The formation of p-nitrocatechol is monitored by LC-MS/MS.\n\n\n \nExample 38\n\n\nIntegrase Inhibition Activity for Select Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nA time-of-addition experiment is performed to examine the replication step(s) affected by a compound of formula (I) or (II); formula (III) or (IV); or formula (V)(a), (V)(b) or (V)(c), allowing to classify the mechanism of action of integrase inhibitors and determining how long the addition of a compound can be postponed before it loses antiviral function. The assay is performed according to previously described literature procedures, see Daelemans et al., \nJ.
