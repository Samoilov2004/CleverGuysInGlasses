Description\n\n\n\n\n ΛΜΙΝΟΡ YRIMIDINE KINASE INHIBITORS \n\n\n RELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\n This application claims the benefit of priority to United States Provisional Patent Application serial number 61 /289,685, filed December 23, 2009; and United States Provisional Patent Application serial number 61/324,481 , filed April 1 5, 2010. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n Casein kinase 1 (CK 1 ) is a family of evolutionari ly conserved serine/threonine kinases including seven known members in vertebrates (C l a, -β, -γ ΐ , -γ2, -γ3, -δ and -ε). The CK l s contain a typical kinase domain followed by a C-terminal tail region, which has been implicated in the regulation of CK 1 localization, substrate selectivity and kinase activity. Myriad proteins have been found to be phosphorylated by CK l s, which are involved in a wide range of cellular functions including vesicular trafficking, DNA damage repair, cell cycle progression, cytokinesis and circadian rhythms (reviewed by Gross and Anderson ( 1998); Vielhaber and Virshup (2001 ); Knippschild et al. (2005)). Moreover, CK 1 family members (-α, -δ/ε and -γ) modulate the activities of major signaling pathways (for example, Wnt and Shh) through several mechanisms (Peters et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2002; Price and Kalderon, 2002; Davidson et al., 2005; Zeng et al., 2005 and reviewed by Price (2006)). \n\n\n In mammals seven CK 1 isoforms, namely CK l a, β, γι , δ and ε, and several splice variants have been described. They all contain a highly conserved kinase domain, a short N-terminal domain of 6 to 76 amino acids and a highly variable C-terminal domain of 24 to more than 200 amino acids. The constitutive phosphotransferase activity of CK 1 isoforms is tightly controlled by several mechanisms. For example, the closely related isoforms CK 15 and ε, which share a 98% identity at the amino acid level in their catalytic domain, are regulated by autophosphorylation, dephosphorylation and proteolytic cleavage. \n\n\nMembers of the CK 1 family are found in the nucleus, the cytoplasm and in the plasma membrane. By phosphorylating many different substrates bearing either a canonical or non-canonical consensus sequence they modulate the activity of key regulator proteins involved in many cellular processes such as cell differentiation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, circadian rhythm, chromosome segregation, and vesicle transport. \n\n\nB3825299.2 \n\n The Pirn kinase family contains three isoforms, Pim- 1 , Pim-2 and Pim-3, and has recently emerged as targets of interest in oncology and immune regulation. Ongoing studies have identified a role for these proteins in cell survival and proliferation, both functionally and mechanistically, and overexpression has been observed in a number of human cancers and inflammatory states. \n\n\n Pirn kinases suppress apoptosis and regulate cell-cycle progression. Elevated levels of Pirn kinases have been reported in solid tumors such as prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer. Pim- 1 was initially discovered in murine leukemia and several independent studies have shown this kinase to be upregulated in human prostate cancer. Pim- 1 , 2 and 3 make up a distinct and highly homologous family of serine/threonine kinases belonging to the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-related (CAMK) family. In addition to the three gene-encoded proteins, translational variants have also been reported for Pim- 1 and 2 resulting from utilization of alternative start codons. The name Pirn refers to the original identification of the pim- 1 gene as a frequent proviral insertion site in Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced T-cell lymphomas, and the gene encoding Pim-2 was subsequently found to have similar susceptibility. Pim-3, originally designated kinase induced by depolarization ( ID)- l , was later renamed due to high sequence similarity to Pim- 1 (71 % identity at the amino acid level). Considering all three isoforms, Pirn proteins are widely expressed with high levels in hematopoietic tissue and are aberrantly expressed in a variety of human malignancies. Pirn kinases positively regulate cell survival and proliferation, affording therapeutic opportunities in oncology. The Pirn protein kinases are frequently overexpressed in prostate cancer and certain forms of leukemia and lymphoma. \n\n\n A role for Pirn kinases in immune regulation has also been observed. Pim-2 has been reported to have enhanced levels of expression in a variety of inflammatory states and may function as a positive regulator of interleukin-6 (IL-6), whereby overexpression of the kinase augments stimulus-induced IL-6 levels. Pim- 1 and 2 have also been implicated in cytokine-induced T-cell growth and survival. Comparing the sensitivity of stimulated T cel ls from Pim- 1 -/-Pim-2-/- mice to wild-type mice following treatment with the immunosuppressant rapamycin, it was found that T-cell activation was significantly impaired by Pim- 1 /Pim-2 deficiency, suggesting that Pirn kinases promote lymphocyte growth and survival through a PI3 /AKT (P B, protein kinase B)/mammal ian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-independent pathway. Other parallel but independent functions and overlapping substrate specificity for proteins in these pathways have been reported as well, \n\n including the positive regulation of transcription of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF- B)- responsive genes, which have implications in both inflammation and oncology. Therefore, Pim kinases are attractive targets for both therapeutic areas. Further, Pim kinases have been reported to play a role in the protection of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter P- glycoprotein (Pgp; ABCB l ) from proteolytic and proteasomal degradation. Pgp is known to mediate drug efflux and as such, inhibitors of Pim kinases may provide a novel approach to abrogating drug resistance. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n An aspect of the present invention relates to compounds that inhibit casein kinase 1 and/or casein kinase 2 and/or a PIM kinase.

When Q50 is S, the phosphoryl moiety is a \"phosphorothioate\". \n\n\n The term \"phosphoramidite\" is art-recognized and may be represented in the general formulas: \n\n Q 59 \n\n\n\n\n\nwherein Q5 1 , R50, R51 and R59 are as defined above. \n\n\n The term \"phosphonamidite\" is art-recognized and may be represented \n\n\ngeneral formulas: \n\n\nQ 59 \n\n\n\n\n\nwherein Q51 , R50, R51 and R59 are as defined above, and R60 represents a lower alky I or an aryl. \n\n\n Analogous substitutions may be made to alkenyl and alkynyl groups to produce, for example, aminoalkenyls, aminoalkynyls, amidoalkenyls, amidoalkynyls, iminoalkenyls, iminoalkynyls, thioalkenyls, thioalkynyls, carbonyl-substituted alkenyls or alkynyls. \n\n\n The definition of each expression, e.g., alkyl, m, n, and the like, when it occurs more than once in any structure, is intended to be independent of its definition elsewhere in the same structure. \n\n\n The terms triflyl, tosyl, mesyl, and nonaflyl are art-recognized and refer to trifluoromethanesulfonyl, /7-toluenesulfonyl, methanesuifonyl, and \n\n\nnonafluorobutanesulfonyl groups, respectively. The terms triflate, tosylate, mesylate, and nonaflate are art-recognized and refer to trifluoromethanesulfonate ester, p-toluenesulfonate ester, methanesulfonate ester, and nonafluorobutanesulfonate ester functional groups and molecules that contain said groups, respectively. \n\n\n The abbreviations Me, Et, Ph, Tf, Nf, Ts, and Ms represent methyl, ethyl, phenyl, trifluoromethanesulfonyl, nonafluorobutanesulfonyl, /7-toluenesulfonyI and \n\n\nmethanesuifonyl, respectively. A more comprehensive list of the abbreviations utilized by organic chemists of ordinary skill in the art appears in the first issue of each volume of the \n\n Journal of Organic Chemistry; this list is typically presented in a table entitled \"Standard List of Abbreviations.\" \n\n\n Certain compounds contained in compositions of the present invention may exist in particular geometric or stereoisomeric forms. In addition, polymers of the present invention may also be optically active. The present invention contemplates all such compounds, including cis- and trans-isomers, E- and Z-isomers, R- and S-enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)-isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, as falling within the scope of the invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention. \n\n\n If, for instance, a particular enantiomer of compound of the present invention is desired, it may be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, or by derivation with a chiral auxiliary, where the resulting diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic functional group, such as amino, or an acidic functional group, such as carboxyl, diastereomeric salts are formed with an appropriate optically-active acid or base, followed by resolution of the diastereomers thus formed by fractional crystallization or \n\n\nchromatographic means well known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantiomers. \n\n\n It will be understood that \"substitution\" or \"substituted with\" includes the implicit proviso that such substitution is in accordance with permitted valence of the substituted atom and the substituent, and that the substitution results in a stable compound, e.g., which does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, or other reaction. \n\n\n The term \"substituted\" is also contemplated to include all permissible substituents of organic compounds. In a broad aspect, the permissible substituents include acyclic and cyclic, branched and unbranched, carbocyclic and heterocyclic, aromatic and nonaromatic substituents of organic compounds. Illustrative substituents include, for example, those described herein above. The permissible substituents may be one or more and the same or different for appropriate organic compounds. For purposes of this invention, the heteroatoms such as nitrogen may have hydrogen substituents and/or any permissible substituents of organic compounds described herein which satisfy the valences of the \n\n heteroatoms. This invention is not intended to be limited in any manner by the permissible substituents of organic compounds. \n\n\n The phrase \"protecting group\" as used herein means temporary substituents which protect a potentially reactive functional group from undesired chemical transformations. Examples of such protecting groups include esters of carboxylic acids, silyl ethers of alcohols, and acetals and ketals of aldehydes and ketones, respectively. Examples of nitrogen protecting groups include an amide (-NRC(=0)R) or a urethane (-NRC(=0)OR), for example, as: a methyl amide (-NHC(=0)CH3); a benzyloxy amide (- NHC(=0)OCH\n2\nC6H\n5\nNHCbz); as a t-butoxy amide (-NHC(=0)OC(CH3)3,-NHBoc); a 2- biphenyl-2-propoxy amide (-NHC(=0)OC(CH\n3\n) 2\nC\n6^ \nC\n6 H5NHB0C), as a 9- fluorenylmethoxy amide (-NHFmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (-NHNvoc), as a 2- trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (-NHTeoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NHTroc), as an allyloxy amide (-NHAlloc), as a 2-(phenylsulfonyl)ethyloxy amide (-NHPsec); or, in suitable cases (e.g., cyclic amines), as a nitroxide radical. The field of protecting group chemistry has been reviewed (Greene, T. W.; Wuts, P.G.M. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2\nnd\n ed.; Wiley: New York, 1991 ). Protected forms of the inventive compounds are included within the scope of this invention. \n\n\n The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" or \"salt\" refers to a salt of one or more compounds. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds include acid addition salts, such as those formed with mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, and also those formed with organic acids such as maleic acid. For example, acids commonly employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable salts include inorganic acids such as hydrogen bisulfide, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric and phosphoric acid, as well as organic acids such as para-toluenesulfonic, salicylic, tartaric, bitartaric, ascorbic, maleic, besylic, fiimaric, gluconic, glucuronic, formic, glutamic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, lactic, oxalic, para-bromophenylsulfonic, carbonic, succinic, citric, benzoic and acetic acid, and related inorganic and organic acids. Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus include sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caprate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, butyne- l ,4-dioate, hexyne- l ,6-dioate, benzoate, \n\n chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, terephathalate, sulfonate, xylenesulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, β-hydroxybutyrate, glycolate, maleate, tartrate, \n\n\nmethanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphthalene- 1 -sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, mandelate and the like. \n\n\n Where the compounds carry one or more acidic moieties, pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be formed by treatment of a solution of the compound with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable base. Suitable bases for forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts with acidic functional groups include, but are not limited to, hydroxides and carbonates of alkali metals such as sodium, potassium, and lithium; alkaline earth metal such as calcium and magnesium; and other metals, such as aluminum and zinc. Suitable bases also incllude ammonia, and organic amines, such as unsubstituted or hydroxy- substituted mono-, di-, or trialkylamines; dicyclohexylamine; tributyl amine; pyridine; N- methyl,N-ethylamine; diethylamine; triethylamine; mono-, bis-, or tris-(2-hydroxy-lower alkyl amines), such as mono-, bis-, or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, 2-hydroxy-tert- butylamine, or tris-(hydroxymethyl)methylamine, N,N-di alkyl-N-(hydroxy alkyl)-amines, such as N,N-dimethyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, or tri-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine; N-methyl- D-glucamine; and amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and the like. \n\n\n Certain compounds of the invention and their salts may exist in more than one crystalline form (i.e., polymorph); the present invention includes each of the crystal forms and mixtures thereof. \n\n\n Certain compounds of the invention and their salts may also exist in the form of solvates, for example hydrates, and the present invention includes each solvate and mixtures thereof. \n\n\n Certain compounds of the invention may contain one or more chiral centers, and exist in different optically active forms. When compounds of the invention contain one chiral center, the compounds exist in two enantiomeric forms and the present invention includes both enantiomers and mixtures of enantiomers, such as racemic mixtures thereof. The enantiomers may be resolved by methods known to those skilled in the art; for example, enantiomers may be resolved by formation of diastereoisomeric salts which may be separated, for example, by crystallization; formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives or complexes which may be separated, for example, by crystallization, gas-liquid or liquid \n\n chromatography; selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent, for example, via enzymatic esterification; or gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example, on a chiral support; suitable include chiral supports (e.g., sil ica with a bound chiral ligand) or in the presence of a chiral solvent. Where the desired enantiomer is converted into another chemical entity by one of the separation procedures described above, a further step may be used to liberate the desired purified enantiomer. Alternatively, specific enantiomers may be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting one enantiomer into the other by asymmetric transformation. \n\n\n When a compound of the invention contains more than one chiral center, it may exist in diastereoisomeric forms. The diastereoisomeric compounds may be separated by methods known to those skilled in the art (for example, chromatography or crystallization) and the individual enantiomers may be separated as described above. The present invention includes the various diastereoisomers of compounds of the invention, and mixtures thereof. Compounds of the invention may exist in different tautomeric forms or as different geometric isomers, and the present invention includes each tautomer and/or geometric isomer of compounds of the invention, and mixtures thereof. For example, any olefins present in the compounds may exist as either the E- or Z- geometric isomers or a mixture thereof unless stated otherwise. Compounds of the invention may exist in zwitterionic form. The present invention includes each zwitterionic form of compounds of the invention, and m ixtures thereof. \n\n\n As used herein the term \"pro-drug\" refers to an agent, which is converted into the parent drug in vivo by some physiological chemical process (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to the physiological pH is converted to the desired drug form). Pro-drugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmacological compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a pro-drug would be a compound of the present invention wherein it is administered as an ester (the \"pro-drug\") to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is not beneficial, but then it is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid once inside the cell where water solubility is beneficial. Pro-drugs have many useful properties. For example, a pro-drug may be more water soluble than the ultimate drug, thereby facilitating intravenous administration of the \n\n drug. A pro-drug may also have a higher level of oral bioavailability than the ultimate drug. After administration, the prodrug is enzymatically or chemically cleaved to deliver the ultimate drug in the blood or tissue. \n\n\n Exemplary pro-drugs release an amine of a compound of the invention wherein the free hydrogen of an amine or alcohol is replaced by (C| -C6)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1 -((C|- C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1 -methyl- l -((C | -C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (C| -C6)alkoxycarbonyl- oxymethyl, N-(C| -C6)alkoxycarbonylamino-methyl, succinoyl, (C | -C6)alkanoyl, a- amino(C|-C\n4\n)alkanoyl, arylactyl and a-aminoacyl, or α-aminoacyl-a-aminoacyl wherein said α-aminoacyl moieties are independently any of the naturally occurring L-amino acids found in proteins, -P(0)(OH)\n2\n, -P(0)(0(C|-C\n6\n)alkyl)\n2\n or glycosyl (the radical resulting from detachment of the hydroxyl of the hemiacetal of a carbohydrate). \n\n\n Other exemplary pro-drugs upon cleavage release a corresponding free acid, and such hydrolyzable ester-forming residues of the compounds of this invention include but are not limited to carboxylic acid substituents (e.g., -(CH\n2\n)C(0)OH or a moiety that contains a carboxylic acid) wherein the free hydrogen is replaced by (C|-C\n4\n)alkyl, (C\n2\n- C |\n2\n)alkanoyloxymethyl, (C\n4\n-C\n9\n)l -(alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1 -methyl- l -(alkanoyloxy)-ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, l -(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, 1 -methyl- 1 - (alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, N- (alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, 1 -(N-\n\n\n(alkoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl having from 4 to 1 0 carbon atoms, 3-phthalidyl, 4- crotonolactonyl, gamma-butyrolacton-4-yl, di-N,N-(C|-C\n2\n)alkylamino(C2-C3)alkyl (such as β-dimethylaminoethyl), carbamoyl-(C| -C\n2\n)alkyl, N,N-di(C i-C\n2\n)-alkylcarbamoyl-(C |- C\n2\n)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidino- or morpholino(C\n2\n-C3)alkyI. \n\n\n The term \"subject\" as used herein, refers to an animal, typically a mammal or a human, that will be or has been the object of treatment, observation, and/or experiment. When the term is used in conjunction with administration of a compound or drug, then the subject has been the object of treatment, observation, and/or administration of the compound or drug. \n\n\n The terms \"co-administration\" and \"co-administering\" refer to both concurrent administration (administration of two or more therapeutic agents at the same time) and time varied administration (administration of one or more therapeutic agents at a time different \n\n from that of the administration of an additional therapeutic agent or agents), as long as the therapeutic agents are present in the patient to some extent at the same time. \n\n\n The term \"therapeutically effective amount\" as used herein, means that amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits a biological or medicinal response in a cell culture, tissue system, animal, or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, clinician, or physician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease, condition, or disorder being treated. \n\n\n The term \"composition\" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product that results, directly or indirectly, from combinations of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. \n\n\n The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" refers to a medium that is used to prepare a desired dosage form of a compound. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can include one or more solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicles; dispersion or suspension aids; surface active agents; isotonic agents; thickening or emulsifying agents; preservatives; solid binders; lubricants; and the like. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fifteenth Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1975) and Handbook of \n\n\nPharmaceutical Excipients, Third Edition, A. H. Kibbe ed. (American Pharmaceutical Assoc. 2000), disclose various carriers used in formulating pharmaceutical compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. \n\n\nCOMPOUNDS \n\n\n An aspect of the invention relates to a compound of formula 1 : \n\n\n \n\n or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein independently for each occurrence: W and X are independently oxygen or sulfur;

chemically protected form. The term \"chemically protected form,\" as used herein, pertains to a compound in which one or more reactive functional groups are protected from undesirable chemical reactions (i.e., they have been modified with a protecting group). \n\n\n By protecting a reactive functional group, reactions involving other unprotected reactive functional groups can be performed without affecting the protected group; the protecting group may be removed, usually in a subsequent step, without substantially affecting the remainder of the molecule. See, for example, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green and P. Wuts, Wiley, 1991 ), and Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (T. Green and P. Wuts; 3rd Edition; John Wiley and Sons, 1999). \n\n\n For example, a hydroxy group may be protected as an ether (-OR) or an ester (-OC(=0)R), for example, as: a t-butyl ether; a benzyl, benzhydryl (diphenylmethyl), or trityl (triphenylmethyl) ether; a trimeth Isilyl or t-but Idimethylsily 1 ether; or an acetyl ester (-OC(=0)CH\n3\n,-OAc). \n\n For example, an aldehyde or ketone group may be protected as an acetal or ketal, respectively, in which the carbonyl group (C(=0)) is converted to a diether (C(OR)\n2\n), by reaction with, for example, a primary alcohol. The aldehyde or ketone group is readily regenerated by hydrolysis using a large excess of water in the presence of acid. \n\n\n For example, an amine group may be protected, for example, as an amide \n\n\n (-NRC(=0)R) or a urethane (-NRC(=0)OR), for example, as: a methyl amide \n\n\n(-NHC(=0)CH\n3\n); a benzyloxy amide (-NHC(=0)OCH\n2\nC\n6\nH\n5\nNHCbz); as a t-butoxy amide (-NHC(=0)OC(CH\n3\n)\n3\n, -NHBoc); a 2-biphenyl-2-propoxy amide \n\n\n (-NHC(=0)OC(CH\n3\n)2C6H4C6H\n5\nNHBoc), as a 9-fluorenylmethoxy amide (-NHFmoc), as a 6-nitroveratryloxy amide (-NH voc), as a 2-trimethylsilylethyloxy amide (-NHTeoc), as a 2,2,2-trichloroethyloxy amide (-NHTroc), as an allyloxy amide (-NHAIIoc), as a \n\n\n2-(phenylsulfonyl)ethyloxy amide (-NHPsec); or, in suitable cases (e.g., cyclic amines), as a nitroxide radical. \n\n\n For example, a carboxylic acid group may be protected as an ester or an amide, for example, as: a benzyl ester; a t-butyl ester; a methyl ester; or a methyl amide. \n\n\n For example, a thiol group may be protected as a thioether (-SR), for example, as: a benzyl thioether; or an acetamidomethyl ether (-SCH\n2\nNHC(=0)CH\n3\n). \n\n\n PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS \n\n\n One or more compounds of this invention can be administered to a mammal by themselves or in pharmaceutical compositions where they are mixed with suitable carriers or excipient(s) at doses to treat or ameliorate a disease or condition as described herein. Mixtures of these compounds can also be administered to the patient as a simple mixture or in suitable formulated pharmaceutical compositions. For example, one aspect of the invention relates to pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective dose of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, enantiomer or stereoisomer thereof; and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. \n\n\n Techniques for formulation and administration of the compounds of the instant application may be found in references well known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as \"Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,\" Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, latest edition. \n\n Suitable routes of administration may, for example, include oral, eyedrop, rectal, transmucosal, topical, or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. \n\n\n Alternatively, one may administer a compound in a local rather than a systemic manner, for example, via injection of the compound directly into an edematous site, often in a depot or sustained release formulation. \n\n\n Furthermore, one may administer a compound in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with endothelial-cell-specific antibody. \n\n\n The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention thus may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. \n\n\n For injection, the agents of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks' solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants are used in the formulation appropriate to the barrier to be permeated. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. \n\n\n For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated readily by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compound with a solid excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients include fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, \n\n methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. \n\n\n Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. \n\n\n For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. \n\n\n For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., \n\n\ndichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichiorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of e.g., gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. \n\n\n The compounds can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or \n\n aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additional ly, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. \n\n\n Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution before use with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water. \n\n\n The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. \n\n\n In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly or by intramuscular injection). Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives (for example, as a sparingly soluble salt). \n\n\n Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are examples of delivery vehicles or carriers for hydrophobic drugs. Certain organic solvents such as dimethysulfoxide also may be employed. Additionally, the compounds may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semi-permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various sustained-release materials have been established and are well known by those skilled in the art. Sustained-release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few weeks up to over 1 00 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the therapeutic reagent, additional strategies for protein stabi lization may be employed. \n\n The pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include but are not limited to calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers, such as polyethylene glycols. \n\n\nMETHODS OF TREATMENT \n\n\n Provided herein are methods of modulating the activity of C l and subtypes thereof, CK2, the Wnt pathway, and/or the TGFp pathway. Also provided herein are methods of treating or preventing conditions and diseases the course of which can be influenced by modulating the activity of CK l (e.g., CKly), CK2, the Wnt pathway, and/or the TGFp pathway. Such methods typically comprise administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or composition of the invention. \n\n\n Also provided herein are methods of modulating the activity of PIM, such as PIM 1 , PI M 2 or PIM 3, the JAK/STAT pathway, and/or the mTOR pathway, and/or Pgp. Also provided herein are methods of treating or preventing conditions and diseases, the course of which can be influenced by modulating the activity of the PIMs, the JAK/STAT pathway, and/or the mTOR pathway, and/or Pgp. Such methods typically comprise administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or composition of the invention. \n\n\n Various diseases, such as cancers, inflammation, and inflammatory diseases (e.g., osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis), and neurological conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) and neurodegeneration can be treated by administration of modulators of CK l (e.g., CK l y), CK2, the Wnt pathway and/or the TGFp pathway. Bone-related diseases and conditions, including osteoporosis and bone formation, also can be treated by \n\n\nadministration of modulators of CK l (e.g., CK l y), CK2, the Wnt pathway and/or the TGFp pathway. Bone restoration can be facilitated by administration of modulators of CK l (e.g., CK l y), CK2, the Wnt pathway and/or the TGFp pathway. Additional conditions that can be treated by administration of modulators of CK l (e.g., CK l y), CK2, the Wnt pathway and/or the TGFp pathway include hypoglycemia, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. \n\n\nModulators of CK l (e.g., CK l y), CK2, the Wnt pathway and/or the TGFp pathway are also useful for influencing apoptosis (e.g., increasing the rate of apoptosis in cancerous cells). Modulators of CK l (e.g., CK l y), CK2, the Wnt pathway and/or the TGFp pathway are also useful in treatment or prevention of aberrant embryonic development. \n\n Based at least on the fact that increased C l y has been found to be associated with certain cancers, a method for treating cancer in a subject comprises administering to the subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that inhibits CK l y. P1M 1 , PIM2, PIM3, the JAK/STAT pathway, and/or the mTOR pathway have also been found to be associated with certain cancers. Therefore, provided herein is a method for treating cancer comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that inhibits PIM 1 and/or PI 2 and/or PIM3. \n\n\n PIM 1 , PIM2, and PIM3 have also been associated with protecting Pgp from degradation, which can regulate drug efflux and drug resistance. Therefore, provided herein is a method for treating malignancies comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound that inhibits PIM 1 and/or PIM2 and/or PIM3 in conjunction with another drug, compound or material to abrogate resistance to the drug, compound or material. \n\n\n The compounds described herein can be used for modulating cell proliferation, generally. Accordingly, diseases that may be treated include hyperproliferative diseases, such as benign cell growth and malignant cell growth. \n\n\n Exemplary cancers that may be treated include leukemias, e.g., acute lymphoid leukemia and myeloid leukemia, and carcinomas, such as colorectal carcinoma and hepatocarcinoma.

A therapeutically effective amount can also be an amount which is prophylactically effective. The amount which is therapeutically effective will depend upon the patient's size and gender, the condition to be treated, the severity of the condition and the result sought. For a given patient, a therapeutically effective amount may be determined by methods known to those of skill in the art. \n\n\n A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of the compound that results in amelioration of symptoms in a patient. Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the ED50 (effective dose for 50% maximal response). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between MTD and ED50. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. In the treatment of crises, the administration of an acute bolus or an infusion approaching the MTD may be required to obtain a rapid response. \n\n Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active moiety which are sufficient to maintain the C 1 , CK l y, C 2, Pirn 1 -3, Wnt pathway, TGFP pathway, JAK/STAT pathway, mTOR pathway, or Pgp modulating effects, or minimal effective concentration (MEC). The MEC will vary for each compound but can be estimated from in vitro data. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. HPLC assays or bioassays can be used to determine plasma concentrations. \n\n\n Dosage intervals can also be determined using the MEC value. Compounds should be administered using a regimen which maintains plasma levels above the MEC for 1 0-90% of the time, preferably between 30-90% and most preferably between 50-90% until the desired amelioration of symptoms is achieved. In cases of local administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be related to plasma concentration. \n\n\n The amount of composition administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician.\n\n\n ITS \n\n\n The compounds and compositions of the invention (e.g., compounds and compositions of formula I) may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may for example comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a bl ister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration. Compositions comprising a compound of the invention formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical carrier may also be prepared, placed in an appropriate container, and labelled for treatment of an indicated condition. Instructions for use may also be provided. \n\n\nEXEMPLIFICATION \n\n\n The invention now being generally described, it will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples, which are included merely for purposes of illustration of certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention, and are not intended to limit the invention.

Description\n\n\n\n\n COMPOUNDS, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION AND METHODS FOR USE IN TREATING INFLAMMATORY DISEASES \n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention concerns methods and compounds useful in treating and/or preventing inflammatory diseases. More specifically, the invention relates to the use of selective GPR43 agonists or partial agonist and their pharmacologically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, previously described in international patent application No. PCT/EP2009/066536 filed on December 2009 in the name of the present Applicant, for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment and/or prevention of inflammatory diseases. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nThe present invention comprises compounds useful in treating and/or preventing diseases, such as Tumor Necrosis Factor a (TNF-a), IL-Ιβ, IL-6 and/or IL-8 mediated diseases and other resulting diseases. In particular, the compounds of the invention are useful for the treatment and/or prevention of diseases or conditions involving inflammation. \n\n\nTNF-a is upstream in the cytokine cascade of inflammation. As a result, elevated levels of TNF-a may lead to elevated levels of other inflammatory and proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8. \n\n\nTNF-a and Interleukin-1 (IL-1) are pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by a variety of cells, including monocytes and macrophages, in response to many inflammatory stimuli (e.g. lipopolysaccharide-LPS) or external cellular stress (e.g., osmotic shock and peroxide). Elevated levels of TNF-a and/or IL-1 over basal levels have been implicated in mediating or exacerbating a number of disease states including rheumatoid arthritis; inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including but not limited \n\n to Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and colitis; Pagets disease; osteoporosis; multiple myeloma; uveitilis; acute and chronic myelogenous leukemia; pancreatic β cell destruction; rheumatoid spondylitis; osteoarthritis; gouty arthritis and other arthritis conditions; gout; adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); chronic pulmonary inflammation diseases; silicosis; pulmonary sarcoidosis; psoriasis; allergic rhinitis; anaphylaxis; contact dermatitis; pancreatitis; non-alcoholic steato hepatitis (NASH); asthma; muscle degeneration; cachexia such as cachexia secondary to infection or malignancy, cachexia secondary to acquired immune deficiency syndrome; Reiter's syndrome; type I and type II diabetes; bone resorption disease; graft vs. host reaction; ischemia reperfusion injury; atherosclerosis; brain trauma; multiple sclerosis; cerebral malaria; sepsis; septic shock; toxic shock syndrome; endotoxic shock; gram negative sepsis; fever and myalgias due to infection such as influenza; pyrosis. \n\n\nTNF-a and IL-1 appear to play a role in pancreatic β cell destruction and diabetes. Pancreatic β cells produce insulin which helps mediate blood glucose homeostasis. Deterioration of pancreatic β cell functional abnormalities may occur in patients with type II diabetes. \n\n\nAdministration of TNF-a into the rat cortex has been reported to result in significant neutrophil accumulation in capillaries and adherence in small blood vessels. TNF-a promotes the release of other cytokines (IL-Ιβ, IL-6) and also chemokines, which promote neutrophil infiltration into the infarct area (Fleurstein, Stroke 25, 1481 (1994). \n\n\nIn rheumatoid arthritis models in animals, multiple intra-articular injections of IL-1 have led to an acute and destructive form of arthritis (Chandrasekhar et al., Clinical Immunol Immunopathol. 55, 382 (1990)). In studies using cultured rheumatoid synovial cells, IL-1 is a more potent inducer of stromelysin than TNF-a (Firestein, Am. J. Pathol. 140, 1309 (1992)). At sites of local injection, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte emigration has been observed. The emigration is attributed to the induction of chemokines (e.g., IL-8), \n\n and the up-regulation of adhesion molecules (Dinarello, Eur. Cytokines Netw. 5, 517-531 (1994)). \n\n\nIL-8 has been implicated in exacerbating and/or causing many disease states in which massive neutrophil infiltration into sites of inflammation or injury (e.g., ischemia) is mediated by the chemotactic nature of IL-8, including, but not limited to, the following: asthma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriasis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac and renal reperfusion injury, thrombosis and glomerulonephritis. In addition to the chemotaxis effect on neutrophils, IL-8 also has the ability to active neutrophils. Thus, reduction in IL-8 levels may lead to diminished neutrophil infiltration. \n\n\nTNF-cc and IL-1 affect a wide variety of cell and tissues and these cytokines as well as other leukocytes derived cytokine, such as IL-6 and IL-8, are important and critical inflammatory mediators of a wide variety of diseases states and conditions. The inhibition of these cytokines is of benefit in controlling, reducing and alleviating many of these disease states mediated by these cytokines. \n\n\nSeveral approaches have been taken to block the effect of TNF-a. One approach involves using soluble receptors for TNF-a (e.g. TNFR-55 or TNFR-75), which have demonstrated efficacy in animal models of TNF-a- mediated disease states. A second approach to neutralizing TNF-a using a monoclonal antibody specific to TNF-a, cA2, has demonstrated improvement in swollen joint count in a Phase II human trial of rheumatoid arthritis (Feldmann et al; Immunological Reviews, pp. 195-223 (1995)). These approaches block the effects of TNF-a and IL-1 by either protein sequestration or receptor antagonism. \n\n\nIn certain cases, these approaches do not provide effective relief for some sufferers of inflammatory disease and cause adverse effects. Thus, there is currently a need for new anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals. \n\n\nGPR43 (also named FFA2R) belongs to a subfamily of G-Protein- Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), including GPR40 and GPR41 that have been \n\n identified as receptors for free fatty acids (Le Poul et al, J. Biol Chem. 278, 25481-489, 2003; Covington et al., Biochemical Society transaction 34, 770-773, 2006). The 3 family members share 30 to 40% sequences identity with specificity toward different fatty acids carbon chain length, with short chain fatty acids ((SCFAs): six carbons molecules or shorter) activating GPR41 and GPR43 and medium and long chain fatty acids activating GPR40 (Rayasam et al., Expert Opinion on therapeutic targets, 11 661-671, 2007 ). C2 acetate and C3 propionate are the most potent activators of GPR43. \n\n\nGPR43 is strongly expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), bone marrow, and polymorphonuclear cells such as neutrophils. The involvement of GPR43 in leukocyte function is supported by the induction of its mRNA during the differentiation and activation of monocytes and neutrophils cells (Le Poul et al, J. Biol. Chem., 2003, 278: 25481-25489; Senga et al, Blood, 2003, 101 : 1185-1187). Recent studies have shown that both acetate and propionate decreased LPS-stimulated TNF-a release from neutrophils. In addition propionate dose-dependently suppressed IL-6 mRNA and protein release from colitis mouse colon organ cultures. TNF-a and members of the interleukin family are known to play a key role in the pathogenesis of IBD (Fuss, Curr Drug Targets Inflamm allergy 2003, 2: 101-112; Tedelind et al, World J Gastroenterol 2007, 13(20): 2826-2832). Further, GPR43 has been described to regulate the anti-inflammatory responses by SCFA in various in vivo model such as colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and asthma through a regulation of the neutrophil physio lo logy. SCFA-mediated GPR43 activation decreased TNF-a and ΜΙΡ-Ια levels in mouse DSS colitis model, as well as neutrophil chemotactic responsiveness (Maslowski et al, Nature, 2009, 461(7268): 1282-1286). Taken together these results suggest that therapeutic strategies based on GPR43, the major receptor for acetate and propionate for which anti- inflammatory properties have been clearly demonstrated , could be useful in treatment of inflammatory diseases. \n\n\nOn this basis, GPR43 agonists or partial agonists may be of \n\n therapeutic value for the treatment and/or prevention of inflammatory diseases. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The invention relates to the use of compounds of general formula\n\n\n(I) \n\n\n \n\n z I, \n\n\nand pharmacologically acceptable salts and solvates

This includes monoalkylamino and dialkylamino groups. \n\n\nThe compounds of Formula I and sub formulae thereof contain at least one asymmetric center and thus may exist as different stereoisomeric forms. Accordingly, the present invention includes all possible stereoisomers and includes not only racemic compounds but the individual enantiomers and their non racemic mixtures as well. When a compound is desired as a single enantiomer, such may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis, by resolution of the final product or any convenient intermediate, or by chiral chromatographic \n\n methods as each are known in the art. Resolution of the final product, an intermediate, or a starting material may be effected by any suitable method known in the art. See, for example, Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds by E. L. Eliel, S. H. Wilen, and L. N. Mander (Wiley- Interscience, 1994), incorporated by reference with regard to stereochemistry. \n\n\nThe bonds from an asymmetric carbon in compounds of the present invention may be depicted herein using a solid line (— ), a zigzag line ( \n■ww\n ), a solid wedge ( ),a dotted wedge ( ), a solid bar (^^\nm\n) or a dotted bar\n\n\n( ) . The use of a solid line to depict bonds from an asymmetric carbon atom is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers are meant to be included, unless it is clear from the context that a specific stereoisomer is intended. The use of either a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds from an asymmetric carbon atom is meant to indicate that only the stereoisomer shown is meant to be included. \n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may also contain more than one asymmetric carbon atom. In those compounds, the use of a solid line to depict bonds from asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers are meant to be included, unless it is clear from the context that a specific stereoisomer is intended. In those compounds, the use of solid or dotted bars is meant to indicate relative stereochemistry. As an example, \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n similarly,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts.

Figure 4 represents the decrease of blood circulating TNFcc level after compounds 157 and 169 injection in LPS challenged mice. \n\n\nMembrane binding assay: GTPyS binding assay. \n\n\nThe following assay can be used for determination of GPR43 activation. When a GPCPv is in its active state, either as a result of ligand binding or constitutive activation, the receptor couples to a G protein and stimulates the release of GDP and subsequent binding of GTP to the G protein. The alpha subunit of the G protein-receptor complex acts as a GTPase and slowly hydro lyses the GTP to GDP, at which point the receptor normally is deactivated. Activated receptors continue to exchange GDP for GTP. The non-hydro lysable GTP analog, [\n35\nS]GTPyS, was used to demonstrate enhance binding of [\n35\nS]GTPyS to membranes expressing receptors. The assay uses the ability of GPCR to stimulate [\n35\nS]GTPyS binding to membranes expressing the relevant receptors. The assay can, therefore, be used in the direct identification method to screen candidate compounds to endogenous or not endogenous GPCR. \n\n\nPreparation of membrane extracts: \n\n\nMembrane extracts were prepared from cells expressing the human GPR43 receptor (hGPR43) as follows: the medium was aspirated and the cells were scraped from the plates in Ca\n++\n and Mg\n++\n-free Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\n\nThe cells were then centrifuged for 3 min at 1500 g and the pellets were resuspended in buffer A (15 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.3 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA) and homogenized in a glass homogenizer. The crude membrane fraction was collected by two consecutive centrifugation steps at 40.000 x g for 25 min separated by a washing step in buffer A. The final pellet was resuspended in \n\n500 μΐ of buffer B (75 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 12.5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.3 mM EDTA, ImM EGTA, 250 mM sucrose) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein content was assayed by the Folin method. \n\n\nGTPYS assay (SPA method): The assay was performed in the presence of SCFA, and was used to determine the activity of the compounds of the invention. \n\n\nThe [\n35\nS]GTPyS assay was incubated in 20 mM HEPES pH7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 10 μg/ml saponin, 30 mM of MgCl\n2\n, 10 μΜ of GDP, 5 μg membrane-expressing hGPR43, 250μg of wheatgerm agglutinin beads (Amersham, ref: RPNQ001), a range concentration of compounds (from 30 μΜ to 1 nM) in a final volume of 100 μΐ for 30 min at room temperature. The SCFA propionate was used at 1 mM final concentration as positive control. The plates were then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm, incubated for 2 hours at room temperature and counted for 1 min in a scintillation counter (TopCount, PerkinElmer). The results of the tested compounds are reported as the concentration of the compound required to reach 50% (EC\n50\n) of the maximum level of the activation induced by these compounds. \n\n\nWhen tested in the assay described above and by way of illustration the compounds in Table 3 activate GPR43 receptor.

When tested in the cytokines release from PBMC assay described above and by way of illustration the compounds n° 2; 14; 89; 116 and 126 significantly inhibit the IL-6 secretion from PBMC (Figure 2). \n\n IL-8 release from epithelial colon cells \n\n\nHT-29 epithelial colon cell line (ATCC, Manassas) are plated in -well assay plate (2xl0\n5\n cells/well) and stimulated with or without TNFcc (100 ng/ml) and increasing concentration of compounds of the invention for 3 hours at 37°C. Cell supematants are recovered after centrifugation and human soluble IL-8, or other cytokines, are quantified using ELISA assay (R&D system) according manufacturer's recommendation. \n\n\nWhen tested in the IL-8 release from epithelial colon cells assay described above and by way of illustration the compounds n° 14; 89; 116; 126; 142 and 155 significantly inhibit the IL-8 secretion from HT-29 cell line (Figure 3). \n\n\nChemotactic assay \n\n\nBlood is diluted 1/2 with PBS supplemented with 2.6 mM EDTA (PBS-EDTA) and placed v/v onto a Ficoll solution. Blood cells are separated by centrifugation at 500g at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation, cells at the interface (mainly lymphocytes + monocytes) and cells in the pellet (mainly neutrophils + erythrocytes) are collected separately. Neutrophils are washed in 8 ml HBSS and erythrocytes are lysed by hypotonic shock. Then neutrophils are resuspended in HBSS supplemented with 0.1% of Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS). For chemotactic assay, cells (1x105) are plated in the upper part of a 96-well multiscreen assay plate (Millipore). The tested compounds, in combination with or without IL-8 or FMLP, are dispensed in the bottom part of the assay plate. Then, the plate is incubated at 37 °C in cell incubator for at least 2 hours. Then, the cells are recovered from the bottom part of the assay plate by centrifugation at 250g for 5 minutes. The chemotactic response is assessed using ATP light assay. Phagocytosis assay \n\n\nNeutrophils (2xl0\n5\n cells/ weel) are seeded in 96-well assay plate and pre- incubated with or without the tested compounds for 1 hour at 37°C in cell incubator. Then, zymosan is added in each well, and the plate is incubated for 2 \n\n hours at 37°C in cell incubator. The phagocytosis is measured using the cytoselect 96-well phagocytosis assay, following manufacturer's recommendations. \n\n\nSeptic Shock mouse model \n\n\n Mouse male BALB/c, 8 weeks of age, are acclimatized for 7 days. During acclimation and following dosing, animals are housed within a limited access rodent facility and kept in groups of maximum 10 mice, in polypropylene cages, fitted with solid bottoms and filled with wood shavings as bedding material. Animals are provided ad libitum a commercial rodent diet and free access to drinking water, supplied to each cage via polyethylene bottles with stainless steel sipper tubes. The day of the experiments, animals are randomized and experimental groups (n=10) are distributed across cages. A tO on day 0, the compounds of the invention or controls are administered via oral gavage. At time t 0.5h on day 0, mice are subjected to an intra-peritoneal injection of 100 μg of lipopolysachharide (LPS). On day 0 at time t 2h, all mice are tailed bled and serum prepared. On day 0 at time t 6h, all mice are culled, terminal bleeds taken and serum prepared. \n\n\nTNFa, IL-Ιβ and IL-6 levels, or other markers, are measured in each serum using ELISA assay, according to manufacturer's recommendations. \n\n\nWhen tested in the septic shock mouse model described above and by way of illustration the compounds n° 157; and 169 significantly inhibit the TNFa plasmatic level (Figure 4). \n\n\nColitis mouse model \n\n\n Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) induces a robust colitis used as well-known model of inflammatory bowel diseases including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's. Male C57BL6 mice, 25-30 g, receive DSS in drinking water at the concentration of 5 % for 7 days. The tested compound or vehicle control are pre-dosed, via oral or intra-rectal routes, beginning two days prior to DSS treatment and continuing throughout the 7-day exposure to DSS. The disease activity index (DAI) is \n\n measured daily as well as water consumption. At the end of the 7 days of treatment, mice are euthanized and tissues are collected for colonic length, histology, Myeloperoxydase (MPO) and permeability studies. \n\n\nDisease Activity Index (DAI): Each parameter is on a 0-4 scale, and the daily DAI score is the average of the scores for each parameter. Weight loss: 0-4; Stool consistency: 0, 2, 4. Rectal Bleeding: 0, 2, 4. Colonic Length: Colonic length will be recorded ex-vivo in all mice. Histology: Colonic tissue from the proximal, medial and distal colon will be processed with H & E staining and serial sections will be mounted and scored by a blinded, qualified observer. The sum of each parameter is the total histological score. Grade of damage: 0-4; Extent of damage: 0-4; Severity of inflammation: 0-3. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity: MPO activity will be measured as an additional biochemical marker of inflammation using a spectrophotometric assay. Colonic Permeability: To assess the tissue integrity, colonic permeability will be measured in vitro. Specifically, colonic tissues will be mounted in modified Ussing chambers and maintained at 37 °C in oxygenated Krebs buffer. Basal potential difference (\"PD\") and flux of horseradish peroxidase will be monitored over 90 min. \n\n\nMurine model of asthma \n\n\n Nine week-old male BALB/c mice are sensitised on days 1 and 7 by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 50μg ovalbumin (OVA) adsorbed with 2 mg aluminium hydroxide in saline (NaCl 0,9 %). Unsensitised animals received i.p. injections of aluminium hydroxide only. Mice are challenged on days 12 to 15 by intranasal (i.n.) instillations (12.5 μΐ per nostril) of 10 μg OA in saline or of saline alone for unsensitised animals under anaesthesia (50 mg/kg ketamine and 3.33 mg/kg xylazine i.p.). The tested compounds are given by oral gavage (o.g.) 1 h before each OVA challenge on these days. Control mice received NaCl 0.9% alone. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is performed 18-24 hours after the last allergen challenge. Mice are anaesthetised by i.p. injection of ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). The trachea is canulated and lungs lavaged by 10 instillations of 0.5 ml ice-cold saline supplemented with 2.6 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (saline-EDTA). BAL fluid (BALF) is centrifuged (400 g for 5 min at 4°C) to pellet cells. Erythrocytes are lysed by hypotonic choc. \n\n Total cell counts are determined using a hemocytometer. Differential cell counts are assessed on one cytologic preparation obtained by cytocentrifugation (Cytospin 3, Shandon Ltd, Runcorn, Chershire, UK) of 200 μΐ of diluted BALF (250,000 cells/ml in ice-cold saline-EDTA), stained with Diff-Quik (Dade Behring AG). Murine cytokines and chemokines in BAL fluid are assayed by ELISA using paired Abs, according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Blood is collected by cardiac puncture immediately after the thoracic cavity is opened and before BAL is performed. Blood is allowed to clot, then iss centrifuged, and aliquots of serum are stored at -70°C before analysis by ELISA for serum immunoglobulins Igs. \n\n\nAfter BAL sampling is completed, the lungs are removed from the thoracic cavity by careful dissection. The lungs are inflated with 1 ml of 10% neutral-buffered Formalin and then fixed in 10% neutral-buffered Formalin for 72 h. After fixation, the left lung is dissected free and embedded in paraffin, and 6-μιη sections are cut. Sections are then stained with H&E. Total lung inflammation is defined as the sum of the peribronchial and perivascular scores. Peribronchial and perivascular inflammation is quantified by a treatment-blind observer and graded on the following scale: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, marked; and 4, severe. An increment of 0.5 is used when the inflammation fell between two levels. Arthritis mouse models \n\n\nK/BxN model \n\n\n To induce K/BxN arthritis, sera are pooled from arthritic adult K/BxN mice. Recipient C/57black 6 mice are injected intraperitoneally with 150 μΐ on days 0 and 2 and disease progression is monitored as described. Development of arthritis is assessed in a blinded manner using a semiquantitative clinical scoring system for each paw: 0 = normal, 1 = mild to moderate swelling of the ankle/wrist joint or erythema and swelling limited to individual digits, 2 = swollen ankle or swelling in two or more digits, and 3 = severe swelling along all aspects of paw or all five digits swollen. Compounds of the invention are given by oral gavage (o.g.) 2 days \n\n before arthritis induction, as well as during disease monitoring. Control mice received NaCl 0.9% alone. Sera are analyzed for IL-6, TNFcc by ELISA (R&D Systems) according manufacturer's recommendations. \n\n\nCollagen-induced arthritis DBA-1 male mice of 10-12 weeks of age are immunized with 0.1 ml of collagen II emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant, injected at the base of the tail (collagen concentration, 2 mg ml\n~1\n). After 21 days, mice received an i.p. injection of 0.1 mg of collagen II in saline. The arthritis is monitored by scoring inflamed joints in each paw as described: 0 = no inflammation; 1 = mild erythema and swelling of individual digits; 2 = moderate erythema and swelling of the joint; 3 = severe erythema and swelling of the entire paw; 4 = severe erythema and ankylosis of the paw. The arthritic index is the sum of the scores of the four mouse paws; the maximum possible score being 16. Animals are observed every day and, when the first symptom of arthritis is evident, each mouse received an oral gavage of vehicle or the tested compound, once daily for 11 days. Mice are monitored daily during the period of treatment by an observer unaware of the treatment. At 1 day after the last administration of the compound (day 12), blood from the retro-orbital plexus is collected in heparinized tubes and animals killed. Plasma samples are frozen and levels of cytokines and chemokines determined by ELISA (R&D Systems), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasma levels of anti-collagen IgGi and IgG\n2\nA antibodies are determined by direct ELISA. \n\n\nThe effect of treatments on joint inflammation and cartilage and bone damage are evaluated histologically. From each mouse, both hindpaws are removed, fomalin- fixed, decalcified and wax-embedded before sectioning and staining with hematoxilin-eosin. The joint damage score is recorded by assessing the degree of pannus formation, cartilage erosion, and bone destruction. For each parameter a scale ranging from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe) is used. \n\n While embodiments of the invention have been illustrated and described, it is not intended that these embodiments illustrate and describe all possible forms of the invention. Rather, the words used in the specification are words of description rather than limitation ant it is understood that various changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."

Description\n\n\n\n\n BUPRENORPHINE ANALOGS\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention is in the field of medicinal chemistry. It relates to novel buprenorphine analogs having activity as opioid receptor agonists. In certain embodiments compounds of the invention have dual activity as opioid agonists and ORLl receptor antagonists.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nPain is the most common symptom for which patients seek medical advice and treatment. While acute pain is usually self-limited, chronic pain can persist for 3 months or longer and lead to significant changes in a patient's personality, lifestyle, functional ability and overall quality of life (K.M. Foley, Pain, in Cecil Textbook of Medicine 100-107, J.C. Bennett and F. Plum eds., 20th ed. 1996).\n\n\nPain has traditionally been managed by administering either a non-opioid analgesic (such as acetylsalicylic acid, choline magnesium trisalicylate, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, fenoprofen, difiunisal or naproxen), or an opioid analgesic (such as morphine, hydromorphone, methadone, levorphanol, fentanyl, oxycodone or oxymorphone).\n\n\nAlthough the term \"narcotic\" is often used to refer to opioids, the term is not specifically applicable to opioids. The term \"narcotic\", derived from the Greek word for \"stupor\", originally referred to any drug that induced sleep, only later being associated with opioids (Gutstein Howard B., Akil Huda, \"Chapter 21. Opioid Analgesics\" (Chapter 21), Brunton LL, Lazo JS, Parker Kl: Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11\nth\n Edition: http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=940653). In the legal context, the term \"narcotic\" refers to a variety of mechanistically unrelated substances with abuse or addictive potential (Gutstein Howard B., Akil Huda, \"Chapter 21. Opioid Analgesics\" (Chapter 21), Brunton LL, Lazo JS, Parker Kl: Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11\nth\n Edition: http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=940653). Thus, the term \"narcotic\" not only refers to opioids, but also refers to such drugs as cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, etc., which exert their pharmacological effects via different receptors than opioids.\n\n\nFurthermore, because the term \"narcotic\" refers to such a wide variety of unrelated drugs, many of which do not possess analgesic properties, it cannot be assumed that a drug that has \"narcotic\" properties is necessarily analgesic. For example, drugs such as ecstasy and methamphetamine are not analgesic, and are not used to treat pain. \n\n Until recently, there was evidence of three major classes of opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), with each class having subtype receptors. These receptor classes are known as μ, δ and K. AS opiates have a high affinity to these receptors while not being endogenous to the body, research followed in order to identify and isolate the endogenous ligands to these receptors. These ligands were identified as endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins, respectively. Additional experimentation has led to the identification of the opioid receptor-like (ORL-I) receptor, which has a high degree of homology to the known receptor classes. This newly discovered receptor was classified as an opioid receptor based only on structural grounds, as the receptor did not exhibit pharmacological homology. It was initially demonstrated that non-selective ligands having a high affinity for μ, δ and K receptors had low affinity for the ORL-I receptor. This characteristic, along with the fact that an endogenous ligand had not yet been discovered, led to the ORL-I receptor being designated as an \"orphan receptor\".\n\n\nSubsequent research led to the isolation and structure of the endogenous ligand of the ORL-I receptor. This ligand, nociceptin (also known as orphanin FQ (OFQ)), is a seventeen amino acid peptide structurally similar to members of the opioid peptide family. (C. Altier et al., \"ORLl receptor-mediated internalization of N-type calcium channels.\" Nature Neuroscience, 2005, 9:31).\n\n\nThe discovery of the ORL-I receptor, and its endogenous agonist, presents an opportunity for the discovery of novel compounds that can be administered for pain management or other syndromes influenced by this receptor.\n\n\nMany publications in the ORL-I /nociceptin field provide evidence that activation of ORL-I receptors in the brain can inhibit opioid-mediated analgesia (e.g., D. Barlocco et al., \"The opioid-receptor-like 1 (ORL-I) as a potential target for new analgesics.\" Eur. J. Med. Chem., 2000, 35:275; J.S. Mogil et al., \"Orphanin FQ is a functional anti-opioid peptide.\" Neurosci., 1996, 75:333; K. Lutfy et al., \"Tolerance develops to the inhibitory effect of orphanin FQ on morphine-induced antinociception in the rat.\" NeuroReport, 1999, 10:103; M.M. Morgan et al., \"Antinociception mediated by the periaqueductal gray is attenuated by orphanin FQ.\" NeuroReport, 1997, 8:3431 ; and J. Tian et al., \"Involvement of endogenous Orphanin FQ in electroacupuncture-induced analgesia.\" NeuroReport, 1997, 8:497).\n\n\nA growing body of evidence supports a more generalized regulatory role for ORL-I against the actions of the μ receptor, possibly contributing to the development of μ-agonist \n\n tolerance in patients being treated with classical opiates (e.g., J. Tian et al., \"Functional studies using antibodies against orphanin FQ/nociceptin.\" Peptides, 2000, 21 : 1047; and H. Ueda et al., \"Enhanced Spinal Nociceptin Receptor Expression Develops Morphine Tolerance and Dependence.\" J. Neurosci., 2000, 20:7640). Moreover, ORL-I activation appears to have an inhibitory effect on the rewarding properties of several drugs of abuse, including μ agonists.\n\n\nCertain compounds have been described as at least partial agonists for ORL-I (e.g., buprenorphine (IC\n50\n of 8.4 nM), fentanyl (IC\n5O\n of about 10,000 nM), 7-benzylidenenaltrexone (IC\n50\n about 10,000 nM) (S. Wnendt et al., \"Agonistic effect of buprenorphine in a nociceptin/OFQ receptor-triggered reporter gene assay.\" Molec. Pharmacol, 1999, 56:334- 338), and etorphine (IC\n50\n of about 2000 nM) (Hawkinson et al., \"Opioid activity profiles indicate similarities between the nociceptin/orphanin FQ and opioid receptors.\" Eur. J. Pharmacol, 2000, 389:107-114)). However, buprenorphine's μ potency is disclosed to be much greater than its ORL-I potency. Recent data have shown that the analgesic efficacy of buprenorphine is enhanced by pre-treatment with an ORL-I receptor antagonist. Using the tail-flick test in mice, Lutfy et al. demonstrated that buprenorphine's typical bell-shaped dose-response curve (wherein low and high doses induce little analgesia, and mid-range doses produce maximal analgesia) is eliminated by pre-treatment with the ORL-I antagonist J-113397, and analgesic efficacy is improved at the higher range of doses (K. Lutfy et al., \"Buprenorphine-induced antinociception is mediated by mu-opioid receptors and compromised by concomitant activation of opioid receptor-like receptors.\" J. Neurosci., 2003, 23:10331-10337).\n\n\nRecently, a multidisciplinary group of experts in the fields of pharmacology, toxicology, pain management, and anesthesia have recommended buprenorphine as the best opioid for treating chronic severe pain in elderly patients (Pergolizzi, et al. (2008). Opioids and the Management of Chronic Severe Pain in the Elderly: Consensus Statement of an International Expert Panel with Focus on the Six Clinically Most Often Used World Health Organization step III Opioids (buprenorphine, Fentanyl, Hydromorphone, Methadone, Morphine, Oxycodone. Pain Practice 8(4): 287-313). It was found that of the opioids studied, buprenorphine provided the best analgesic-to-side effect profile. Buprenorphine was the most effective opioid for treating neuropathic pain. Buprenorphine was the only opioid for which metabolism was not affected by impaired renal function. Buprenorphine was the only opioid demonstrating a ceiling effect for respiratory depression, indicating that higher \n\n doses may be used. Also, buprenorphine was the least likely to induce immunosuppression. The panel of experts attributed the improved therapeutic efficacy of buprenorphine to its unique pharmacological profile.\n\n\nBuprenorphine has also been shown to have an improved side effect profile in animal models. A review of recent data in animal models of reward and addiction has shown that buprenorphine has a low addictive and dependence-inducing profile compared to other opioids (Tzschentike (2002). Behavioral pharmacology of buprenorphine, with a focus on preclinical models of reward and addiction.

and Shinkai et al., \"4-aminoquinolines: Novel nociceptin antagonists with analgesic activity\", J. Med. Chem., 2000, 43:4667-4677) and J-113397 (described in WO 98/54168; and Kawamoto et al., \"Discovery of the first potent and selective small molecule opioid receptor-like (ORLl) antagonist: 1 -[(3R,4R)-1 -cyclooctylmethyl-S-hydroxymethyM-piperidylJ-S-ethyl- 1 ,3- dihydro-2H-benzimidazol-2-one (J-113397)\", J.

Certain\n\n\nCompounds of the Invention have both: (i) antagonist activity at the ORL-I receptor; and (ii) agonist activity at the μ receptor.\n\n\nCompounds of the Invention may be useful as analgesics; anti-inflammatories; diuretics; anesthetics; neuroprotective agents; anti-hypertensives; anxiolytics; agents for appetite control; hearing regulators; anti-tussives; anti-asthmatics; anti-epileptics; anticonvulsants; modulators of locomotor activity; modulators of learning and memory; regulators of neurotransmitter release; modulators of hormone release; kidney function modulators; anti-depressants; agents to treat memory loss due to Alzheimer's disease or other dementias; agents to treat withdrawal from alcohol and/or drugs of addiction; or agents to control water balance, sodium excretion, arterial blood pressure disorders, UI, ulcers, EBD, IBS, addictive disorders, Parkinson's disease, parkinsonism, anxiety, epilepsy, stroke, a seizure, pruritic conditions, psychosis, cognitive disorders, memory deficits, restricted brain function, Huntington's chorea, ALS, dementia, retinopathy, muscle spasms, migraines, vomiting, dyskinesia, and/or depression (each being a \"Condition\"). The present invention further provides methods for treating a Condition, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a Compound of the Invention. In certain embodiments, the Condition is chronic or acute pain. The \n\n Compounds of the Invention are particularly useful for treating chronic pain. In certain embodiments, the Compound of the Invention is an ORL-I receptor antagonist. In other embodiments, the Compound of the Invention is an agonist at one or more of the μ, δ and/or K receptor. In other embodiments, the Compound of the Invention is both an ORL-I receptor antagonist and an agonist at one or more of the μ, δ and/or K receptor. In other embodiments, the Compound of the Invention is both an ORL-I receptor antagonist and an agonist at the μ receptor. In certain non-limiting embodiments, the Compound of the Invention produces fewer side effects and/or less severe side effects than currently available analgesic opioid compounds when administered at doses producing equivalent levels of analgesia and/or anti- hyperalgesia.\n\n\nIn certain non- limiting embodiments, the Compound of the Invention exhibits a substantially linear dose response curve, such that the bell-shaped dose response curve observed for most opioid analgesics (i.e. low and high doses do not produce significant analgesia, whereas mid-range doses produce analgesia) is not observed for the Compound of the Invention. It is expected, therefore, that it will be easier to titrate to an effective dose of the Compound of the Invention in a patient than it is for conventional opioid analgesics. It is further expected that the Compound of the Invention will produce effective analgesia and/or anti-hyperalgesia in a patient who has become tolerant to conventional opioids, and for whom a conventional opioid is no longer an effective treatment. It is further expected that a Compound of the Invention will produce effective analgesia and/or anti-hyperalgesia at doses that do not induce side effects such as respiratory depression in patients for whom a dose of a conventional opioid that is high enough to be an effective treatment also induces significant side effects such as respiratory depression.\n\n\nThe present invention further provides methods for preventing a Condition, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof a Condition-preventing effective amount of a Compound of the Invention.\n\n\nThe present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a Compound of the Invention admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient.

They are useful for treating one or more Conditions, such as pain. Compounds of the Invention may provide a reduced liability for developing analgesic tolerance and physical dependence. The Compounds of the Invention are useful for modulating a pharmacodynamic response from ORL-I receptors either centrally or peripherally, or both. The Compounds of the Invention may also be useful for modulating a pharmacodynamic response from one or more opioid receptors (μ, δ, K) either centrally or peripherally, or both. The pharmacodynamic response may be attributed to the compound stimulating (agonizing) or inhibiting (antagonizing) the one or more receptors. Certain Compounds of the Invention may inhibit (or antagonize) the ORL-I receptor, while also stimulating (or agonizing) one or more other receptors (e.g. as a μ, δ and/or K agonist). Compounds of the Invention having agonist activity may be either full or partial agonists.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, Compounds of the Invention can be used in combination with at least one other therapeutic agent. The other therapeutic agent can be, but is not limited to, a μ-opioid agonist, a non-opioid analgesic, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, a Cox-II inhibitor, an anti-emetic, a β-adrenergic blocker, an anticonvulsant, an antidepressant, a Ca\n2+\n-channel blocker, an anticancer agent, or a mixture thereof. \n\n Various objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description.\n\n\nThe present invention provides compounds represented by Formula I:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(I)\n\n\nwherein\n\n\nR\n1\n is selected from the group consisting of -(Ci-Cio)alkyl, -(C\n2\n-C i\n2\n)alkenyl, -(C\n2\n- Ci\n2\n)alkynyl, -(C\n3\n-C \n]2\n)cycloalkyl, -(C\n4\n-C i\n2\n)cycloalkenyl, ((C\n3\n-C i\n2\n)cycloalkyl)-(Ci-C\n6\n)alkyl-, ((C\n4\n-Ci\n2\n)cycloalkenyl)-(Ci-C\n6\n)alkyl-, -(5- to 12-membered)aryl, -(5- to 12- membered)heteroaryl, and -(3- to 12-membered) heterocycle; any of which is optionally substituted with one to three substituents independently selected from the group consisting of -(Ci-C\n6\n)alkyl, OH, halo, -C(halo)\n3\n, -CH(halo)\n2\n, -CH\n2\n(halo), NH\n2\n, -NH(Ci-C\n6\n)alkyl, CN and SH.

(Ross and Kenakin, \"Ch. 2: Pharmacodynamics: Mechanisms of Drug Action and the Relationship Between Drug Concentration and Effect\", pp. 31-32, in Goodman & Gilman 's the Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 10\nth\n Ed. (J.G. Hardman, L.E. Limbird and A.Goodman-Gilman eds., 2001). Compounds of the Invention can be in the form of prodrugs of the compounds of\n\n\nFormula I, Formula II or Formula III. Prodrugs are covalently bonded carrier molecules that release an active compound of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III in vivo. Non-limiting examples of prodrugs will typically include esters of the Compounds of the Invention that can \n\n be metabolized to the active compound by the action of enzymes in the body. Such prodrugs may be prepared by reacting a compound of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III with an anhydride such as succinic anhydride.\n\n\nCompounds of the Invention can be isotopically-labeled (i.e., radio-labeled). Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the disclosed compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n11\nC, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\n0, \n17\n0, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF and \n36\nCl, respectively, and preferably \n3\nR, \n11\nC, and \n14\nC. Isotopically-labeled Compounds of the Invention can be prepared by methods known in the art in view of this disclosure. For example, tritiated Compounds of the Invention can be prepared by introducing tritium into the particular compound by catalytic dehalogenation with tritium. This method may include reacting a suitable halogen- substituted precursor of a Compound of the Invention with tritium gas in the presence of an appropriate catalyst such as Pd/C in the presence of a base. Other suitable methods for preparing tritiated compounds are generally described in Filer, Isotopes in the Physical and Biomedical Sciences, Vol. 1, Labeled Compounds (Part A), Chapter 6 (1987). \n14\nC-labeled compounds can be prepared by employing starting materials having a \n14\nC carbon.\n\n\nIso topically labeled Compounds of the Invention, as well as the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs and solvates thereof, can be used as radioligands to test for the binding of compounds to an opioid or ORL-I receptor. For example, a radio-labeled Compound of the Invention can be used to characterize specific binding of a test or candidate compound to the receptor. Binding assays utilizing such radio-labeled compounds can provide an alternative to animal testing for the evaluation of chemical structure-activity relationships. In a non-limiting embodiment, the present invention provides a method for screening a candidate compound for the ability to bind to an opioid or ORL-I receptor, comprising the steps of: a) introducing a fixed concentration of the radio-labeled compound to the receptor under conditions that permit binding of the radio-labeled compound to the receptor to form a complex; b) titrating the complex with a candidate compound; and c) determining the binding of the candidate compound to said receptor.\n\n\nCompounds of the Invention disclosed herein may contain one or more asymmetric centers, thus giving rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms. The present invention encompasses all such possible forms, as well as their racemic and resolved forms and mixtures thereof, and the uses thereof. The individual enantiomers may be separated according to methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the present disclosure. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or \n\n other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, they include both E and Z geometric isomers. All tautomers are intended to be encompassed by the present invention as well.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"stereoisomer\" is a general term for all isomers of individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. It includes enantiomers and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral center that are not mirror images of one another (diastereoisomers).\n\n\nThe term \"chiral center\" refers to a carbon atom to which four different groups are attached. The terms \"enantiomer\" and \"enantiomeric\" refer to a molecule that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image and hence is optically active such that the enantiomer rotates the plane of polarized light in one direction and its mirror image compound rotates the plane of polarized light in the opposite direction.\n\n\nThe term \"racemic\" refers to a mixture of equal parts of enantiomers and which mixture is optically inactive.\n\n\nThe term \"resolution\" refers to the separation or concentration or depletion of one of the two enantiomeric forms of a molecule.\n\n\nThe terms \"a\" and \"an\" refer to one or more.\n\n\nCompounds of the Invention encompass all salts of the disclosed compounds of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III. The present invention preferably includes any and all non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the disclosed compounds. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include inorganic and organic acid addition salts and basic salts. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, metal salts such as sodium salt, potassium salt, cesium salt, and the like; alkaline earth metals such as calcium salt, magnesium salt and the like; organic amine salts such as triethylamine salt, pyridine salt, picoline salt, ethanolamine salt, triethanolamine salt, dicylohexylamine salt, N,N'- dibenzylethylenediamine salt and the like; inorganic acid salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, sulphate and the like; organic acid salts such as citrate, lactate, tartrate, maleate, fumarate, mandelate, acetate, dichloroacetate, trifiuoroacetate, oxalate, formate and the like; sulfonates such as methanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p- toluenesulfonate and the like; and amino acid salts such as arginate, glutamate and the like.\n\n\nAcid addition salts can be formed by mixing a solution of the particular compound of the present invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acid such as hydrochloric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric \n\n acid, carbonic acid, phosphoric acid, oxalic acid, dichloroacetic acid, and the like. Basic salts can be formed by mixing a solution of the particular compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic base such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, choline hydroxide, sodium carbonate and the like. Compounds of the Invention also encompass solvates of the disclosed compounds of\n\n\nFormula I, Formula II or Formula III. The term \"solvate\" as used herein is a combination, physical association and/or solvation of a compound of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III with a solvent molecule such as, e.g. a disolvate, monosolvate or hemisolvate, where the ratio of solvent molecule to compound of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III is 2:1, 1 :1 or 1 :2, respectively. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances, the solvate can be isolated, such as when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated into the crystal lattice of a crystalline solid. Thus, \"solvate\" encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. A compound of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III or may be present as a solvated form with a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as water, methanol, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention include both solvated and unsolvated forms of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III compounds. One type of solvate is a hydrate. A \"hydrate\" relates to a particular subgroup of solvates where the solvent molecule is water. Solvates typically can function as pharmacological equivalents. Preparation of solvates is known in the art. See, for example, M. Caira et al, J. Pharmaceut. ScL, 93(3):601-611 (2004), which describes the preparation of solvates of fluconazole with ethyl acetate and with water. Similar preparation of solvates, hemisolvates, hydrates, and the like are described by E. C. van Tonder et al., AAPSPharm. ScL Tech., 5(l):Article 12 (2004), and A.L. Bingham et al, Chem. Commun., 603-604 (2001). A typical, non-limiting, process of preparing a solvate would involve dissolving a compound of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III in a desired solvent (organic, water, or a mixture thereof) at temperatures above about 20°C to about 25°C, then cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals, and isolating the crystals by known methods, e.g., filtration. Analytical techniques such as infrared spectroscopy can be used to confirm the presence of the solvent in a crystal of the solvate. The present invention also provides the use of a Compound of the Invention in the manufacture of a medicament for treating or preventing a Condition. In one embodiment, the Condition is pain, such as acute or chronic pain. In one embodiment, a Compound of the Invention has agonist activity at the μ, δ and/or K receptors, hi another embodiment a \n\n Compound of the Invention has agonist activity at the μ receptor. In another embodiment, a Compound of the Invention has antagonist activity at the ORL-I receptor. In another embodiment, certain Compounds of the invention can stimulate one receptor (e.g., a μ, δ and/or K agonist) and inhibit a different receptor (e.g., an ORL-I antagonist). In another embodiment, the Compound of the Invention is an agonist at the μ receptor, and an antagonist at the ORL-I receptor.\n\n\nSynthesis of Compounds\n\n\nCompounds of Formula I, Formula II or Formula III can be made using conventional organic synthesis in view of this disclosure, or by the illustrative methods shown in the scheme below.\n\n\nScheme A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThebaine, A \n\n\n\n\n\nThebaine, A, is N-demethylated by reaction with a suitable reagent such as diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) in a suitable solvent such as acetonitrile (ACN) at 50-100° C to provide the secondary amine B.

Stowell, \"Carbanions in Organic Synthesis \", John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1979, p. 184-185). \n\n\n\n\nScheme B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThebaine, A, is O-demethylated by reaction with a suitable reagent such as lithium tή-sec- butylborohydride (L-Selectride, Aldrich) in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 25-65° C (e.g. Rice, K.C., et al. J. Org. Chem., 1996, 61, 6774) to provide the phenol H (R = H). The phenolic group of H is protected with a suitable protecting group (P) to give H (R = P) (e.g. Greene, T. W. \"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis\", J. Wiley & Sons, NY, 1981). Compound H (R = P) is reacted with DEAD according to the procedure in Scheme A (A → B) to provide the secondary amine I.

Wiley & Sons, NYi 1981) to give compound M (R = H). \n\n Scheme C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC j\n\n\nCompound C is O-demethylated and the resulting phenolic group protected with a suitable protecting group (P) to give J according to the procedure shown in Scheme B (A → H).\n\n\nScheme D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeprotect \n\n\n\n\n\nCompound N is prepared from compound L via a Mitsunobu reaction (Hughes, D. L. Org. Prep. 1996, 28, 127) using triphenylphosphine and DEAD. Removal of the protecting group (P) in compound N is achieved according to literature procedure (e.g. Greene, T. W. \"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis\", J. Wiley & Sons, NY, 1981) to give compound O.\n\n\nTesting of Compounds\n\n\nμ-opioid Receptor Binding Assay Procedures: Radioligand dose-displacement binding assays for μ-opioid receptors used 0.3 nM [\n3\nH]-diprenorphine (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT), with 5 mg membrane protein/well in a final volume of 500 μl binding buffer (10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EDTA, 5% DMSO, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4).

The prepared membrane solution (190 μl/well) was transferred to 96-shallow well polypropylene plates containing 10 μl of 2Ox concentrated stock solutions of agonist prepared in DMSO. Plates were incubated for 30 min at a temperature of about 25°C with shaking. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96-well Unifilter GF/B filter plates (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT) using a 96-well tissue harvester (Packard) and followed by three filtration washes with 200 μl ice-cold binding buffer (10 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 10 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, pH 7.4).

Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C and pellets resuspended in hypotonic buffer to a final concentration of 1-3 mg/ml. \n\n Protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumen as standard. Aliquots of the ORL-I receptor membranes were stored at - 80°C.\n\n\nRadioligand binding assays (screening and dose-displacement) used 0.1 nM [\n3\nH]- nociceptin (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT; 87.7 Ci/mmole) with 12 μg membrane protein in a final volume of 500 μl binding buffer (10 raM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM EDTA, 5% DMSO, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 nM unlabeled nociceptin (American Peptide Company). All reactions were performed in 96-deep well polypropylene plates for 1 h at room temperature. Binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96-well Unifilter GF/C filter plates (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT) presoaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine (Sigma). Harvesting was performed using a 96-well tissue harvester (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT) followed by three filtration washes with 500 μl ice-cold binding buffer. Filter plates were subsequently dried at 50°C for 2-3 hours. Fifty μl/well scintillation cocktail (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT) was added and plates were counted in a Packard Top-Count for 1 min/well.

Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C, and pellets resuspended in hypotonic buffer to a final concentration of 1-3 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumen as standard. Aliquots of the ORL-I receptor membranes were stored at -80°C. \n\n Functional [\n35\nS]GTPyS binding assays were conducted as follows. ORL-I membrane solution was prepared by sequentially adding final concentrations of 0.026 μg/μl ORL-I membrane protein, 10 μg/ml saponin, 3 μM GDP and 0.20 nM [\n35\nS]GTPyS to binding buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 niM MgCl\n2\n, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) on ice. The prepared membrane solution (190 μl/well) was transferred to 96-shallow well polypropylene plates containing 10 μl of 2Ox concentrated stock solutions of agonist/nociceptin prepared in DMSO. Plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with shaking. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration onto 96-well Unifilter GF/B filter plates (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT) using a 96- well tissue harvester (Packard) and followed by three filtration washes with 200 μl ice-cold binding buffer (10 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 10 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, pH 7.4). Filter plates were subsequently dried at 50°C for 2-3 hours. Fifty μl/well scintillation cocktail (Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT) was added and plates were counted in a Packard Top-Count for 1 min/well. Data were analyzed using the sigmoidal dose-response curve fitting functions in GraphPad PRISM v. 3.0, or an in-house function for non-linear, sigmoidal dose-response curve- fitting. ORL-I Receptor Functional Data; ORL-I GTP EC\n50\n is the concentration of a compound providing 50% of the maximal response for the compound at an ORL-I receptor. In certain embodiments, the Compounds of the Invention that have a high binding affinity (i.e. low Kj value) will have an ORL-I GTP EC\n50\n (nM) of greater than about 10,000 (i.e. will not stimulate at therapeutic concentrations) In certain embodiments Compounds of the Invention will have an ORL-I GTP EC\n50\n (nM) of about 20,000 or less. In one embodiment, the Compounds of the Invention will have an ORL-I GTP EC\n50\n (nM) of about 10,000 or less; or of about 5000 or less; or of about 1000 or less. In still other embodiments, the Compounds of the Invention will have an ORL-I GTP EC\n50\n (nM) of about 100 or less; or of about 10 or less; or of about 1 or less; or of about 0.1 or less. . ORL-I GTP E^ % is the maximal effect elicited by a compound relative to the effect elicited by nociceptin, a standard ORL-I agonist, hi certain embodiments, Compounds of the Invention will have an ORL-I GTP E\nmax\n of less than 10% (which, for the purposes of this invention, is interpreted as having antagonist activity at ORL-I receptors). Certain Compounds of the Invention will have an ORL-I GTP E\nmax\n (%) of greater than 1%; or of greater than 5%; or of greater than 10%. hi other embodiments the Compounds of the\n\n\nInvention will have an ORL-I GTP E\nmax\n of greater than 20%; or of greater than 50%; or of greater than 75%; or of greater than 88%; or of greater than 100%. \n\n In Vivo Assays for Prevention or Treatment of Pain\n\n\nTest Animals: Each experiment uses rats weighing between 200-260 g at the start of the experiment. The rats are group-housed and have free access to food and water at all times, except prior to oral administration of a Compound of the Invention when food is removed for about 16 hours before dosing. A control group acts as a comparison to rats treated with a Compound of the Invention. The control group is administered the carrier for the Compound of the Invention. The volume of carrier administered to the control group is the same as the volume of carrier and Compound of the Invention administered to the test group. Acute Pain: To assess the actions of a Compound of the Invention for the treatment or prevention of acute pain, the rat tail flick test can be used. Rats are gently restrained by hand and the tail exposed to a focused beam of radiant heat at a point 5 cm from the tip using a tail flick unit (Model 7360, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy). Tail flick latencies are defined as the interval between the onset of the thermal stimulus and the flick of the tail. Animals not responding within 20 seconds are removed from the tail flick unit and assigned a withdrawal latency of 20 seconds. Tail flick latencies are measured immediately before (pre-treatment) and 1, 3, and 5 hours following administration of a Compound of the Invention. Data are expressed as tail flick latency(s) and the percentage of the maximal possible effect (% MPE), i.e., 20 seconds, is calculated as follows:\n\n\n[ (post administration latency) - (pre-administration latency) ]\n\n\n% MPE = x 100\n\n\n(20 s pre-administration latency)\n\n\nThe rat tail flick test is described in F. E. D'Amour et al., \"A Method for Determining Loss of Pain Sensation,\" J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 72:74-79 (1941).\n\n\nInflammatory Pain: To assess the actions of a Compound of the Invention for the treatment or prevention of inflammatory pain, the Freund's complete adjuvant (\"FCA\") model of inflammatory pain was used. FC A-induced inflammation of the rat hind paw is associated with the development of persistent inflammatory mechanical hyperalgesia and provides reliable prediction of the anti-hyperalgesic action of clinically useful analgesic drugs (L. Bartho et al, \"Involvement of Capsaicin-sensitive Neurones in Hyperalgesia and Enhanced Opioid Antinociception in Inflammation,\" Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacol.\n\n\n- IS - \n\n 342:666-670 (1990)). The left hind paw of each animal was administered a 50 μL intraplantar injection of 50% FCA. Prior to injection of FCA (baseline) and 24 hour post injection, the animal was assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining the PWT, as described below. Rats were then administered a single injection of 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg of either a Compound of the Invention; 30mg/kg of a control drug selected from Celebrex, indomethacin or naproxen; or carrier. Responses to noxious mechanical stimuli were determined 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours post administration. Percentage reversal of hyperalgesia for each animal was defined as:\n\n\n[ (post administration PWT) - (pre-administration PWT) ]\n\n\n% Reversal = x 100\n\n\n[ (baseline PWT) - (pre-administration PWT) ]\n\n\nCompounds of the Invention induced significant anti -hyperalgesia in the FCA test, with no observed side effects at the ED\n5O\n dose. For example, Compound 11 had an ED\n50\n of 3.6 mg/kg, and no side effects were observed at this dose (see Fig. 11). At the analgesic (i.e. more than anti-hyperalgesic) dose of 10 mg/kg rats showed slightly reduced activity, but remained alert and oriented to changes in their environment.\n\n\nNeuropathic Pain: To assess the actions of a Compound of the Invention for the treatment or prevention of neuropathic pain, either the Seltzer model or the Chung model can be used. hi the Seltzer model, the partial sciatic nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain is used to produce neuropathic hyperalgesia in rats (Z. Seltzer et al, \"A Novel Behavioral Model of Neuropathic Pain Disorders Produced in Rats by Partial Sciatic Nerve Injury,\" Pain 43:205-218 (1990)). Partial ligation of the left sciatic nerve is performed under isoflurane/O\n2\n inhalation anaesthesia. Following induction of anesthesia, the left thigh of the rat is shaved and the sciatic nerve exposed at high thigh level through a small incision and is carefully cleared of surrounding connective tissues at a site near the trocanther just distal to the point at which the posterior biceps semitendinosus nerve branches off of the common sciatic nerve. A 7-0 silk suture is inserted into the nerve with a 3/8 curved, reversed-cutting mini-needle and tightly ligated so that the dorsal V\n3\n to Vi of the nerve thickness is held within the ligature. The wound is closed with a single muscle suture (4-0 nylon (Vicryl)) and vetbond tissue glue. \n\n Following surgery, the wound area is dusted with antibiotic powder. Sham-treated rats undergo an identical surgical procedure except that the sciatic nerve is not manipulated. Following surgery, animals are weighed and placed on a warm pad until they recover from anesthesia. Animals are then returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animal is assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, prior to surgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1, 3, and 5 hours after drug administration. Percentage reversal of neuropathic hyperalgesia is defined as:\n\n\n[ (post administration PWT) - (pre-administration PWT) ] % Reversal = x 100\n\n\n[ (baseline PWT) - (pre-administration PWT) ]\n\n\nIn the Chung model, the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain is used to produce mechanical hyperalgesia, thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia in rats. Surgery is performed under isoflurane/O\n2\n inhalation anaesthesia. Following induction of anaesthesia, a 3 cm incision is made and the left paraspinal muscles are separated from the spinous process at the L\n4\n - S\n2\n levels. The L\n6\n transverse process is carefully removed with a pair of small rongeurs to identify visually the L\n4\n - L\n6\n spinal nerves. The left L\n5\n (or L\n5\n and L\n6\n) spinal nerve(s) is isolated and tightly ligated with silk thread. A complete hemostasis is confirmed and the wound is sutured using non-absorbable sutures, such as nylon sutures or stainless steel staples. Sham-treated rats undergo an identical surgical procedure except that the spinal nerve(s) is not manipulated. Following surgery animals are weighed, administered a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of saline or ringers lactate, the wound area is dusted with antibiotic powder and they are kept on a warm pad until they recover from the anesthesia. Animals are then returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animals are assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, prior to surgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1, 3, and 5 hours after being administered a Compound of the Invention. The animal can also be assessed for response to noxious thermal stimuli or for tactile allodynia, as described below. The Chung model for neuropathic pain is described in S.H. Kim, \"An Experimental Model for Peripheral\n\n\nNeuropathy Produced by Segmental Spinal Nerve Ligation in the Rat,\" Pain 50(3):355-363 (1992). \n\n Response to Mechanical Stimuli as an Assessment of Mechanical Hyperalgesia:\n\n\nThe paw pressure assay was used to assess mechanical hyperalgesia. For this assay, hind paw withdrawal thresholds (PWT) to a noxious mechanical stimulus were determined using an analgesymeter (Model 7200, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy) as described in C. Stein, \"Unilateral Inflammation of the Hindpaw in Rats as a Model of Prolonged Noxious Stimulation: Alterations in Behavior and Nociceptive Thresholds,\" Pharmacol. Biochem. and Behavior 31:451-455 (1988). The maximum weight that was applied to the hind paw was set at 250 g and the end point was taken as complete withdrawal of the paw. PWT was determined once for each rat at each time point and either only the affected (ipsilateral; same side as the injury) rear paw was tested, or both the ipsilateral and contralateral (non-injured; opposite to the injury) rear paw were tested.\n\n\nResponse to Thermal Stimuli as an Assessment of Thermal Hyperalgesia: The plantar test can be used to assess thermal hyperalgesia. For this test, hind paw withdrawal latencies to a noxious thermal stimulus are determined using a plantar test apparatus (commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy) following the technique described by K. Hargreaves et ai, \"A New and Sensitive Method for Measuring Thermal Nociception in Cutaneous Hyperalgesia,\" Pain 32(l):77-88 (1988). The maximum exposure time is set at 32 seconds to avoid tissue damage and any directed paw withdrawal from the heat source is taken as the end point. Three latencies are determined at each time point and averaged. Either only the affected (ipsilateral) paw is tested, or both the ipsilateral and contralateral (non-injured) paw are tested.\n\n\nAssessment of Tactile Allodynia: To assess tactile allodynia, rats are placed in clear, plexiglass compartments with a wire mesh floor and allowed to habituate for a period of at least 15 minutes. After habituation, a series of von Frey monofilaments are presented to the plantar surface of the affected (ipsilateral) foot of each rat. The series of von Frey monofilaments consists of six monofilaments of increasing diameter, with the smallest diameter fiber presented first. Five trials are conducted with each filament with each trial separated by approximately 2 minutes. Each presentation lasts for a period of 4-8 seconds or until a nociceptive withdrawal behavior is observed. Flinching, paw withdrawal or licking of the paw are considered nociceptive behavioral responses.\n\n\nAssessment of Respiratory Depression: To assess respiratory depression, rats were prepared by implanting a femoral artery cannula via which blood samples were taken. Blood \n\n samples were taken prior to drug administration, then 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours post-treatment. Blood samples were processed using an arterial blood gas analyzer (e.g., IDEXX VetStat with Respiratory/Blood Gas test cartridges). Comparable devices are a standard tool for blood gas analysis (e.g., D. Torbati et al., 2000 Intensive Care Med. (26) 585-591). For example, compound 11 did not induce respiratory depression at the ED\n50\n dose for anti-hyperalgesia, nor did it induce respiratory depression at a higher dose that was shown to be analgesic (10 mg/kg) in the FCA model of inflammatory pain (see Figs. 1 to 5).\n\n\nThe following tables show the statistical analysis of the blood gas measurements in drug-treated rats, compared to rats administered water.\n\n\nTABLE 1: Statistical Analysis of Oxygen Tension in Blood Samples pO2 2-way RM ANOVA\n\n\nTreatment F(4,180) = 8.42 p < 0.0001\n\n\nTime F(4,180) = 8.40 p < 0.0001\n\n\nInteraction F(16,180) = 2.95 p < 0.0005 Post hoc Bon erroni-corrected MCT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ns\" = not significant \"*\" _ statistically significant, p < 0.05 vs. water group \"**\" = statistically significant, p < 0.01 vs. water group \"***\" = statistically significant, p < 0.001 vs. water group \n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2: Statistical Analysis of Oxygen Saturation in Blood Sarnt sO2\n\n\n2-way RM ANOVA\n\n\nTreatment F(4,180) = 14.55 p < 0.0001\n\n\nTime F(4,180) = 18.32 p < 0.0001\n\n\nInteraction F(16,180) = 8.32 p < 0.0001\n\n\nPost hoc Bon erroni-corrected MCT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ns\" = not significant \"*\" = statistically significant, p < 0.05 vs. water group ι\nι\n**\nιι\n _ statistically significant, p < 0.01 vs. water group i\nt\n***.. _ statistically significant, p < 0.001 vs. water group\n\n\nTABLE 3: Statistical Analysis of Carbon Dioxide Tension in Blood Samples pCO2\n\n\n2-way RM ANOVA\n\n\nTreatment F(4,180) = 21.32 p < 0.0001\n\n\nTime F(4,180) = 10.19 p < 0.0001\n\n\nInteraction F( 16,180) = 10.92 p < 0.0005\n\n\nPost hoc Bon erroni-corrected MCT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ns\" = not significant ι\nι\n**\nιι\n _ statistically significant, p < 0.01 vs. water group\n\n\n\"***\" = statistically significant, p < 0.001 vs. water group \n\n TABLE 4: Statistical Analysis of Total Carbon Dioxide (Including Bicarbonate) in Blood\n\n\nSamples tCO2 2-way RM ANOVA\n\n\nTreatment F(4, 180) = 6.15 p < 0.001\n\n\nTime F(4,180) = 25.57 p < 0.0001\n\n\nInteraction F(16,180) = 1.94 p < 0.05 Post hoc Bon erroni-corrected MCT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ns\" = not significant\n\n\n\"*\" = statistically significant, p < 0.05 vs. water group ι\nι\n**\nιi\n \n=\n statistically significant, p < 0.01 vs. water group \"***\" = statistically significant, p < 0.001 vs. water group\n\n\nTABLE 5: Statistical Analysis of Blood pH in Blood Samples pH 2-way RM ANOVA\n\n\nTreatment F(4, 180) = 14.54 p < 0.0001\n\n\nTime F(4, 180) = 4.48 p < 0.005\n\n\nInteraction F( 16,180) = 7.96 p < 0.0001 Post hoc Bon erroni-corrected MCT)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"ns\" = not significant\n\n\nSimilarly, at doses up to 20 mg/kg, compound 6 did not induce respiratory depression (see Figs. 6 to 10). Assessment of Gastric Motility: Animals were treated with vehicle, reference compound or test article by oral gavage at a volume of 10 mL/kg. At one hour post-dose, all \n\n animals were treated with charcoal meal solution (5% non-activated charcoal powder in a solution of 1 % carboxymethylcellulose in water) at a volume of 10 mL/kg. At two hours post-dose (one hour post-charcoal), animals were sacrificed by carbon dioxide inhalation or isoflurane overdose and the transit of charcoal meal identified. The stomach and small intestine were removed carefully and each placed on a saline-soaked absorbent surface. The distance between the pylorus and the furthest progression of charcoal meal was measured and compared to the distance between the pylorus and the ileocecal junction. The charcoal meal transit was expressed as a percentage of small intestinal length traveled. For example, compound 11 induced dose-dependent inhibition of gastric motility.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nDue to their activity, the Compounds of the Invention are advantageously useful in human and veterinary medicine. As described above, the Compounds of the Invention are useful for treating or preventing a Condition in an animal in need thereof.

A Compound of the Invention can be administered by any appropriate route, as determined by the medical practitioner. Methods of administration may include intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, parenteral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, transmucosal, rectal, by inhalation, or topical (particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin). Delivery can be either local or systemic. In certain embodiments, administration will result in the release of a Compound of the Invention into the bloodstream.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions of the invention can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets, pills, pellets, multiparticulates, capsules, capsules containing liquids, capsules containing powders, capsules containing multiparticulates, lozenges, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, aerosols, sprays, or any other form suitable for use.

Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical excipients are described in \n\n Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., 19th ed. 1995), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions of the invention preferably comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient so as to provide the form for proper administration to the animal. Such a pharmaceutical excipient can be a diluent, suspending agent, solubilizer, binder, disintegrant, preservative, coloring agent, lubricant, and the like. The pharmaceutical excipient can be a liquid, such as water or an oil, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. The pharmaceutical excipient can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating, and coloring agents can be used. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is sterile when administered to an animal. Water is a particularly useful excipient when a Compound of the Invention is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid excipients, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients also include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The invention compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. Specific examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients that can be used to formulate oral dosage forms are described in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, American Pharmaceutical Association (1986).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the Compounds of the Invention are formulated for oral administration. A Compound of the Invention to be orally delivered can be in the form of tablets, capsules, gelcaps, caplets, lozenges, aqueous or oily solutions, suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, for example. When a Compound of the Invention is incorporated into oral tablets, such tablets can be compressed, tablet triturates, enteric-coated, sugar-coated, film-coated, multiply compressed or multiply layered.\n\n\nAn orally administered Compound of the Invention can contain one or more additional agents such as, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, and stabilizers, to provide stable, pharmaceutically palatable dosage \n\n forms. Techniques and compositions for making solid oral dosage forms are described in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets (Lieberman, Lachman and Schwartz, eds., 2nd ed.) published by Marcel Dekker, Inc. Techniques and compositions for making tablets (compressed and molded), capsules (hard and soft gelatin) and pills are also described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1553-1593 (Arthur Osol, ed., 16\nth\n ed., Mack\n\n\nPublishing, Easton, PA 1980). Liquid oral dosage forms include aqueous and nonaqueous solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and solutions and/or suspensions reconstituted from non- effervescent granules, optionally containing one or more suitable solvents, preservatives, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, diluents, sweeteners, coloring agents, flavoring agents, and the like. Techniques and compositions for making liquid oral dosage forms are described in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems, (Lieberman, Rieger and Banker, eds.) published by Marcel Dekker, Inc.\n\n\nWhen a Compound of the Invention is formulated for parenteral administration by injection (e.g., continuous infusion or bolus injection), the formulation can be in the form of a suspension, solution, or emulsion in an oily or aqueous vehicle, and such formulations can further comprise pharmaceutically necessary additives such as one or more stabilizing agents, suspending agents, dispersing agents, and the like. When a Compound of the Invention is to be injected parenterally, it can be, e.g., in the form of an isotonic sterile solution. A Compound of the Invention can also be in the form of a powder for reconstitution as an injectable formulation.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a Compound of the Invention is formulated into a pharmaceutical composition for intravenous administration. Typically, such compositions comprise sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions can also include a solubilizing agent. A Compound of the Invention for intravenous administration can optionally include a local anesthetic such as benzocaine or prilocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where a Compound of the Invention is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where a Compound of the Invention is administered by injection, an ampule of \n\n sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\nWhen a Compound of the Invention is to be administered by inhalation, it can be formulated into a dry aerosol, or an aqueous or partially aqueous solution. In another embodiment, a Compound of the Invention can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990); and Treat et al, Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer 317-327 and 353-365 (1989)).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a Compound of the Invention is administered locally. This can be achieved, for example, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g. , in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository or enema, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a Compound of the Invention can be delivered in an immediate release form. In other embodiments, a Compound of the Invention can be delivered in a controlled-release system or sustained-release system. Controlled- or sustained-release pharmaceutical compositions can have a common goal of improving drug therapy over the results achieved by their non-controlled or non-sustained-release counterparts. In one embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release composition comprises a minimal amount of a Compound of the Invention to treat or prevent the Condition (or a symptom thereof) in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled- or sustained- release compositions include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased compliance. In addition, controlled- or sustained-release compositions can favorably affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the Compound of the Invention, and can thus reduce the occurrence of adverse side effects.\n\n\nControlled- or sustained-release compositions can initially release an amount of a Compound of the Invention that promptly produces the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, and gradually and continually release other amounts of the Compound of the Invention to maintain a level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. To maintain a constant level of the Compound of the Invention in the body, the Compound of the Invention can be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of \n\n Compound of the Invention being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled- or sustained-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions, including but not limited to, changes in pH, changes in temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or availability of water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.\n\n\nControlled-release and sustained-release means for use according to the present invention may be selected from those known in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent Nos.: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; and 5,733,566, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide controlled- or sustained-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, multiparticulates, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled- or sustained-release formulations known in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active ingredients of the invention in view of this disclosure. See also Goodson, \"Dental Applications\" (pp. 115- 138) in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Vol. 2, Applications and Evaluation, R.S. Langer and D. L. Wise eds., CRC Press (1984). Other controlled- or sustained-release systems that are discussed in the review by Langer, Science 249: 1527-1533 (1990) can be selected for use according to the present invention. In one embodiment, a pump can be used (Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990); Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et ah, Surgery 88:507 (1980); and Saudek et al, N. Engl. J. Med. 321 :51 A (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release (Langer and Wise eds., 1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance (Smolen and Ball eds., 1984); Ranger and Peppas, J. Macromol. ScL Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61 (1983); Levy et al, Science 228:190 (1985); During et al., Ann. Neurol. 25:351 (1989); and Howard et al., J. Neurosurg. 71:105 (1989)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release system can be placed in proximity of a target of a Compound of the Invention, e.g., the spinal column, brain, or gastrointestinal tract, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose. \n\n When in tablet or pill form, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In these latter platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time-delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate can also be used. Oral compositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate. In one embodiment, the excipients are of pharmaceutical grade.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions of the invention include single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled- or sustained-release.\n\n\nThe amount of the Compound of the Invention that is effective for the treatment or prevention of a condition can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro and/or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed will also depend on, e.g., the route of administration and the extent of the Condition to be treated, and can be decided according to the judgment of a practitioner and/or each animal's circumstances. Variations in dosing may occur depending upon typical factors such as the weight, age, gender and physical condition (e.g. , hepatic and renal function) of the animal being treated, the affliction to be treated, the severity of the symptoms, the frequency of the dosage interval, the presence of any deleterious side-effects, and the particular compound utilized, among other things.\n\n\nSuitable effective dosage amounts can range from about O.Olmg/kg of body weight to about 3000 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day, although they are typically from about 0.01mg/kg of body weight to about 2500 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day or from about 0.01mg/kg of body weight to about 1000 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day. In one embodiment, the effective dosage amount is about 100 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day or less. In another embodiment, the effective dosage amount ranges from about 0.01mg/kg of body weight to about 100 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per \n\n day of a Compound of the Invention, in another embodiment, about 0.02 mg/kg of body weight to about 50 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day, and in another embodiment, about 0.025 mg/kg of body weight to about 20 mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day.\n\n\nAdministration can be as a single dose or as a divided dose. In one embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 24h until the Condition is abated, hi another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 12h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 8h until the Condition is abated, hi another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 6h until the Condition is abated, hi another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 4h until the Condition is abated. The effective dosage amounts described herein refer to total amounts administered; that is, if more than one Compound of the Invention is administered, the effective dosage amounts correspond to the total amount administered.\n\n\nWhere a cell capable of expressing the ORL-I receptor is contacted with a Compound of the Invention in vitro, the amount effective for inhibiting or activating the ORL-I receptor function in a cell will typically range from about 10\n~12\n mol/L to about 10\n\"4\n mol/L, or from about 10 \n12\n mol/L to about 10\n'5\n mol/L, or from about 10 \n12\n mol/L to about 10\n\"6\n mol/L, or from about 10\n\"12\n mol/L to about 10\n\"9\n mol/L of a solution or suspension of the compound in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. hi one embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension comprising the Compound of the Invention will be from about 0.0 lμL to about ImL. hi another embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension will be about 200 μL.\n\n\nWhere a cell capable of expressing the μ-opioid receptors is contacted with a Compound of the Invention in vitro, the amount effective for inhibiting or activating the μ- opioid receptors function in a cell will typically range from about 10\n\"12\n mol/L to about 10\n\"4\n mol/L,or from about 10\n\"12\n mol/L to about 10\n\"5\n mol/L, or from about 10\n\"12\n mol/L to about 10\n\"6\n mol/L, or from about 10\n'12\n mol/L to about 10\n\"9\n mol/L of a solution or suspension of the Compound of the Invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. hi one embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension comprising the Compound of the Invention will be from about 0.0 lμL to about 1 mL. hi another embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension will be about 200 μL.\n\n\nWhere a cell capable of expressing the δ-opioid receptors is contacted with a Compound of the Invention in vitro, the amount effective for inhibiting or activating the δ- \n\n opioid receptors function in a cell will typically range from about 10\n\"12\n mol/L to about 10\n\"4\n mol/L,or from about 10\n'12\n mol/L to about 10\n\"5\n mol/L, or from about 10\n\"12\n mol/L to about 10\n'6\n mol/L, or from about 10\n\"12\n mol/L to about 10\n\"9\n mol/L of a solution or suspension of the Compound of the Invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In one embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension comprising the Compound of the\n\n\nInvention will be from about O.OlμL to about ImL. In another embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension will be about 200 μL.\n\n\nWhere a cell capable of expressing the κ-opioid receptors is contacted with a Compound of the Invention in vitro, the amount effective for inhibiting or activating the K- opioid receptors function in a cell will typically range from about 10\n\"12\n mol/L to about 10\n\"4\n mol/L,or from about 10\n\"12\n mol/L to about 10\n5\n mol/L, or from about 10\n\"12\n mol/L to about 10\n\"6\n mol/L, or from about 10\n\"12\n mol/L to about 10\n\"9\n mol/L of a solution or suspension of the Compound of the Invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In one embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension comprising the Compound of the Invention will be from about O.OlμL to about 1 mL. In another embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension will be about 200 μL.\n\n\nThe Compounds of the Invention can be assayed in vitro or in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity prior to use in humans. Animal model systems can be used to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Certain Compounds of the Invention will have an ED\n50\n for treating inflammatory pain ranging from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg. For example, compound 11 was efficacious in an inflammatory pain model as described above, with an ED\n50\n of about 3.6 mg/kg. Certain Compounds of the Invention will produce significant analgesia and/or anti-hyperalgesia at doses that do not induce respiratory depression. For example, at the anti-hyperalgesic ED\n50\n dose, and at the higher analgesic dose of 10 mg/kg, the measures of blood gases (oxygen tension, oxygen saturation, carbon dioxide tension, total carbon dioxide and pH), at 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours following drug administration, were not different in rats given compound 11 compared to rats given plain water. In contrast, oxygen tension, oxygen saturation and pH are significantly decreased, while carbon dioxide is significantly increased, in blood samples from rats given effective doses of conventional opioids, such as morphine.\n\n\nAccording to the invention, methods for treating or preventing a Condition in an animal in need thereof can further comprise co-administering to the animal an effective \n\n amount of a second therapeutic agent in addition to a Compound of the Invention (i.e., a first therapeutic agent). An effective amount of the second therapeutic agent will be known or determinable by a medical practitioner in view of this disclosure and published clinical studies. In one embodiment of the invention, where a second therapeutic agent is administered to an animal for treatment of a Condition (e.g. , pain), the minimal effective amount of the Compound of the Invention (i.e., the first therapeutic agent) will be less than its minimal effective amount would be in circumstances where the second therapeutic agent is not administered. In this embodiment, the Compound of the Invention and the second therapeutic agent can act either additively or synergistically to treat or prevent a Condition. Alternatively, the second therapeutic agent may be used to treat or prevent a disorder that is different from the Condition for which the first therapeutic agent is being administered, and which disorder may or may not be a Condition as defined hereinabove. In one embodiment, a Compound of the Invention is administered concurrently with a second therapeutic agent as a single composition comprising an effective amount of a Compound of the Invention and an effective amount of the second therapeutic agent. Alternatively, a composition comprising an effective amount of a Compound of the Invention and a second composition comprising an effective amount of the second therapeutic agent are concurrently administered. In another embodiment, an effective amount of a Compound of the Invention is administered prior or subsequent to administration of an effective amount of the second therapeutic agent. In this embodiment, the Compound of the Invention is administered while the second therapeutic agent exerts its therapeutic effect, or the second therapeutic agent is administered while the Compound of the Invention exerts its therapeutic effect for treating or preventing a Condition.\n\n\nThe second therapeutic agent can be, but is not limited to, an opioid agonist, a non- opioid analgesic, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, an antimigraine agent, a Cox-II inhibitor, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, an anti-emetic, a β-adrenergic blocker, an anticonvulsant, an antidepressant, a Ca\n2+\n-channel blocker, an anti-cancer agent, an agent for treating or preventing UI, an agent for treating or preventing anxiety, an agent for treating or preventing a memory disorder, an agent for treating or preventing obesity, an agent for treating or preventing constipation, an agent for treating or preventing cough, an agent for treating or preventing diarrhea, an agent for treating or preventing high blood pressure, an agent for treating or preventing epilepsy, an agent for treating or preventing \n\n anorexia/cachexia, an agent for treating or preventing drug abuse, an agent for treating or preventing an ulcer, an agent for treating or preventing IBD, an agent for treating or preventing IBS, an agent for treating or preventing addictive disorder, an agent for treating or preventing Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism, an agent for treating or preventing a stroke, an agent for treating or preventing a seizure, an agent for treating or preventing a pruritic condition, an agent for treating or preventing psychosis, an agent for treating or preventing Huntington's chorea, an agent for treating or preventing ALS, an agent for treating or preventing a cognitive disorder, an agent for treating or preventing a migraine, an agent for treating, preventing or inhibiting vomiting, an agent for treating or preventing dyskinesia, an agent for treating or preventing depression, or any mixture thereof.\n\n\nExamples of useful opioid agonists include, but are not limited to, alfentanil, allylprodine, alphaprodine, anileridine, benzylmorphine, bezitramide, buprenorphine, butorphanol, clonitazene, codeine, desomorphine, dextromoramide, dezocine, diampromide, diamorphone, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, dimenoxadol, dimepheptanol, dimethylthiambutene, dioxaphetyl butyrate, dipipanone, eptazocine, ethoheptazine, ethylmethylthiambutene, ethylmorphine, etonitazene, fentanyl, heroin, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, hydroxypethidine, isomethadone, ketobemidone, levorphanol, levophenacylmorphan, lofentanil, meperidine, meptazinol, metazocine, methadone, metopon, morphine, myrophine, nalbuphine, narceine, nicomorphine, norlevorphanol, normethadone, nalorphine, normorphine, norpipanone, opium, oxycodone, oxymorphone, papaveretum, pentazocine, phenadoxone, phenomorphan, phenazocine, phenoperidine, piminodine, piritramide, proheptazine, promedol, properidine, propiram, propoxyphene, sufentanil, tilidine, tramadol, pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, or any mixture thereof.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the opioid agonist is selected from codeine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, dihydrocodeine, dihydromorphine, morphine, tramadol, oxymorphone, pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, or any mixture thereof.\n\n\nExamples of useful non-opioid analgesics include, but are not limited to, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, benoxaprofen, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, flubufen, ketoprofen, indoprofen, piroprofen, carprofen, oxaprozin, pramoprofen, muroprofen, trioxaprofen, suprofen, aminoprofen, tiaprofenic acid, fluprofen, bucloxic acid, indomethacin, sulindac, tolmetin, zomepirac, tiopinac, zidometacin, acemetacin, fentiazac, clidanac, oxpinac, mefenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, flufenamic \n\n acid, niflumic acid, tolfenamic acid, diflurisal, flufenisal, piroxicam, sudoxicam, isoxicam, a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, or any mixture thereof.
