Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nPriority is claimed to U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60/752,612, filed 20 Dec. 2005, incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe histamine H\n4 \nreceptor is a 390 amino-acid, seven-transmembrane G protein coupled receptor with approximately 40% homology to the histamine H\n3 \nreceptor. In contrast to the H\n3 \nreceptor, which is primarily located in the brain, the H\n4 \nreceptor is expressed at greater levels in eosinophils and mast cells, among other inflammatory cells. H\n4 \nreceptor ligands should thus be suitable for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders. Examples of diseases where treatment with H\n4 \nligands is particularly appropriate are inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, colitis ulcerosa, dermatitis, psoriasis, conjunctivitis, rheumatoid arthritis, respiratory diseases such as adult respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, asthma, emphysema, rhinitis, chronic sinusitis, allergy, allergy-induced airway responses, allergic rhinitis, viral rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis, perennial and seasonal rhinitis, nasal congestion and allergic congestion.\n\n\nRecently some histamine H\n4 \nreceptor ligands have been developed. An overview of the current advance in H\n4 \nligand research and patenting is given in \nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents \n(2003) 13(6). Examples of Histamine H\n4 \nreceptor ligands can be found in WO 02/072548, WO 04/022537 and in Terzioglu et al., \nJ. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Left. \n14 (2004), 5251-5256.\n\n\nAlthough H\n4 \nligands are known there is still a need to further provide new H\n4 \nligands that are good drug candidates. In particular, preferred compounds should bind potently to the histamine H\n4 \nreceptor whilst showing little affinity for other receptors. They should be well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, be metabolically stable and possess favourable pharmacokinetic properties. They should be non-toxic and demonstrate few side-effects.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention thus relates to pyrimidine derivatives of formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor a pharmaceutically and/or veterinarily acceptable derivative thereof, wherein:\n\n \n \nR\n1 \nis C\n1-8\nalkyl, C\n3-7\ncycloalkyl-C\n0-6\nalkyl- optionally substituted with methyl, alkoxyalkyl containing 3 to 8 carbon atoms, het-C\n0-6\nalkyl-, CF\n3\n-C\n1-6\nalkyl-, CF\n3\nOC\n2-3\nalkyl-, aryl-C\n0-6\nalkyl- or C\n1-6\nhydroxyalkyl;\n \nR\n2 \nis het, provided that the het group contains at least one nitrogen atom or is substituted by a group which contains at least one nitrogen atom;

fluoro or chloro.\n\n\nThe term “alkyl” includes both straight-chain and branched chain groups. This also applies if they carry substituents such as a hydroxy substitutent or occur as substituents of other radicals, for example alkoxy groups. For example, the term C\n1-4\nalkyl includes methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl and tertbutyl moieties. Examples of the corresponding alkoxy moieties are methoxy, ethoxy, n-propyloxy, iso-propyloxy, n-butyloxy, iso-butyloxy, secbutyloxy and tert-butyloxy. Furthermore, examples of suitable C\n1-4\nalkyl moieties substituted by an hydroxyl group are hydroxymethyl, 1-hydroxyethyl, 2-hydroxyethyl, 1-hydroxypropyl, 2-hydroxypropyl, 3-hydroxypropyl, etc.\n\n\nThe term C\n3\n-C\n7 \ncycloalkyl includes bridged bicyclic cycloalkyl such as bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl. Preferred cycloalkyl groups are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl.\n\n\nPreferred “4 to 8 membered heterocyclic group which optionally contains one or more further heteroatoms or groups independently selected from N, O, S, S(O) and S(O)\n2\n, wherein the heterocyclic group is a spiro bicyclic group” are 2,8-diaza-spiro[4.5]dec-2-yl and 2,7-diaza-spiro[4.4]non-2-yl.\n\n\nThe skilled person will of course appreciate that it is not possible to substitute some of the defined heterocyclic ring groups of Formula I in all positions with some of the optional substituents defined above. It is to be understood that such substitutions do not form part of the invention.\n\n\nExample compounds that fall within the above definition of the invention include:\n\n \n

provides the following compounds:\n\n \n \nN\n4\n-(Cyclopropylmethyl)-6-[(3R)-3-(methylamino)pyrrolidin-1-yl]pyrimidine-2,4-diamine,\n \nN\n4\n-(Cyclopropylmethyl)-6-[(3R)-3-(methylamino)pyrrolidin-1-yl]pyrimidine-2,4-diamine tartrate\n \nN\n4\n-(2,2-Dimethylpropyl)-6-[3-(methylamino)azetidin-1-yl]pyrimidine-2,4-diamine, and,\n \nN\n4\n-(2,2-Dimethylpropyl)-6-[3-(methylamino)azetidin-1-yl]pyrimidine-2,4-diamine hydrochloride,\n\n\nor a pharmaceutically and/or veterinarily acceptable derivative thereof.\n\n \n\n\nBy pharmaceutically and/or veterinarily acceptable derivative it is meant any pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable salt, solvate, ester or amide, or salt or solvate of such ester or amide, of the compounds of formula (I) or any other compound which upon administration to the recipient is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of formula (I) or an active metabolite or residue thereof. Preferably, pharmaceutically and/or veterinarily acceptable derivative means any pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable salt or solvate of the compounds of formula (I)\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) include the acid addition and base salts thereof.\n\n\nSuitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the acetate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate, bicarbonate/carbonate, bisulphate/sulphate, borate, camsylate, citrate, edisylate, esylate, formate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, hexafluorophosphate, hibenzate, hydrochloride/chloride, hydrobromide/bromide, hydroiodide/iodide, isethionate, lactate, malate, maleate, malonate, mesylate, methylsulphate, naphthylate, 2-napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, orotate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, phosphate/hydrogen phosphate/dihydrogen phosphate, saccharate, stearate, succinate, tartrate, tosylate and trifluoroacetate salts.\n\n\nSuitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts. Examples include the aluminium, arginine, benzathine, calcium, choline, diethylamine, diolamine, glycine, lysine, magnesium, meglumine, olamine, potassium, sodium, tromethamine and zinc salts.\n\n\nHemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulphate and hemicalcium salts.\n\n\nFor a review on suitable salts, see \nHandbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties. Selection, and Use \nby Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany, 2002).\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by one or more of three methods:\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) by reacting the compound of formula (I) with the desired acid or base;\n \n(ii) by removing an acid- or base-labile protecting group from a suitable precursor of the compound of formula (I) or by ring-opening a suitable cyclic precursor, for example, a lactone or lactam, using the desired acid or base; or\n \n(iii) by converting one salt of the compound of formula (I) to another by reaction with an appropriate acid or base or by means of a suitable ion exchange column.\n \n \n \n\n\nAll three reactions are typically carried out in solution. The resulting salt may precipitate out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionisation in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may exist in both unsolvated and solvated forms. The term ‘solvate’ is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of the invention and a stoichiometric amount of one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term ‘hydrate’ is employed when said solvent is water.\n\n\nIncluded within the scope of the invention are complexes such as clathrates, drug-host inclusion complexes wherein, in contrast to the aforementioned solvates, the drug and host are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Also included are complexes of the drug containing two or more organic and/or inorganic components which may be in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. The resulting complexes may be ionised, partially ionised, or non-ionised. For a review of such complexes, see J Pharm Sci, 64 (8), 1269-1288, by Haleblian (August 1975).\n\n\nHereinafter all references to compounds of formula (I) include derivatives thereof and complexes of the compound or derivatives thereof.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention include compounds of formula (I) as hereinbefore defined, including all polymorphs and crystal habits thereof, prodrugs and isomers thereof (including optical, geometric and tautomeric isomers) as hereinafter defined and isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I).\n\n\nAs indicated, so-called ‘pro-drugs’ of the compounds of formula (I) are also within the scope of the invention. Thus certain derivatives of compounds of formula (I) which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into compounds of formula (I) having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as ‘prodrugs’. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in \nPro\n-\ndrugs as Novel Delivery Systems\n, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T. Higuchi and W. Stella) and \nBioreversible Carriers in Drug Desicn\n, Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E. B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association).\n\n\nProdrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of formula (I) with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as ‘pro-moieties’ as described, for example, in \nDesign of Prodrugs \nby H. Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).\n\n\nSome examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include:\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) where the compound of formula (I) contains a carboxylic acid functionality (—COOH), an ester thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid functionality of the compound of formula (I) is replaced by (C\n1\n-C\n8\n)alkyl;\n \n(ii) where the compound of formula (I) contains an alcohol functionality (—OH), an ether thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the alcohol functionality of the compound of formula (I) is replaced by (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyloxymethyl; and\n \n(iii) where the compound of formula (I) contains a primary or secondary amino functionality (—NH\n2 \nor —NHR where R is not H), an amide thereof, for example, a compound wherein, as the case may be, one or both hydrogens of the amino functionality of the compound of formula (I) is/are replaced by (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkanoyl.\n \n \n \n\n\nFurther examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references.\n\n\nMoreover, certain compounds of formula (I) may themselves act as prodrugs of other compounds of formula (I).\n\n\nAlso included within the scope of the invention are metabolites of compounds of formula (I), that is, compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug. Some examples of metabolites in accordance with the invention include:\n\n \n \n(i) where the compound of formula (I) contains a methyl group, an hydroxymethyl derivative thereof (—CH\n3\n→—CH\n2\nOH):\n \n(ii) where the compound of formula (I) contains an alkoxy group, an hydroxy derivative thereof (—OR→—OH);\n \n(iii) where the compound of formula (I) contains a tertiary amino group, a secondary amino derivative thereof (—-NR\na\nR\nb\n→—NHR\na \nor —NHR\nb\n);\n \n(iv) where the compound of formula (I) contains a secondary amino group, a primary derivative thereof (—NHR\na\n→—NH\n2\n);\n \n(v) where the compound of formula (I) contains a phenyl moiety, a phenol derivative thereof (—Ph→—PhOH); and\n \n(vi) where the compound of formula (I) contains an amide group, a carboxylic acid derivative thereof (—CONR\nc\nR\nd\n→COOH).\n \n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier, tautomeric isomerism (‘tautomerism’) can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds of formula (I) containing, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group, or so-called valence tautomerism in compounds which contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.\n\n\nIncluded within the scope of the present invention are all stereoisomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I), including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, and mixtures of one or more thereof. Also included are acid addition or base salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, d-lactate, l-tartrate or l-lysine, or racemic, for example, dl-tartrate or dl-arginine.\n\n\nConventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\n\nAlternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound of formula (I) contains an acidic or basic moiety, a base or acid such as 1-phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person.\n\n\nChiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin.\n\n\nStereoisomeric conglomerates may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art—see, for example, \nStereochemistry of Organic Compounds \nby E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen (Wiley, New York, 1994).\n\n\nThe present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of formula (I) wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number which predominates in nature.\n\n\nExamples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, such as \n2\nH and \n3\nH, carbon, such as \n11\nC, \n13\nC and \n14\nC, chlorine, such as 36Cl, fluorine, such as \n18\nF, iodine, such as \n123\nl and \n125\nl, nitrogen, such as \n13\nN and \n15\nN, oxygen, such as \n15\nO, \n17\nO and \n18\nO, phosphorus, such as \n32\nP, and sulphur, such as \n35\nS.\n\n\nCertain isotopically labelled compounds of formula (I), for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. \n3\nH, and carbon-14, i.e. \n14\nC, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.\n\n\nSubstitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. \n2\nH, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.\n\n\nSubstitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n15\nO and \n13\nN, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.\n\n\nIsotopically labelled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically labelled reagent in place of the non-labelled reagent previously employed.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D\n2\nO, d\n6\n-acetone, d\n6\n-DMSO.\n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) may be prepared according to scheme 1 that follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5 \nand R\n8 \nare as defined above, and X and Y are leaving groups.\n\n\n\nAccording to scheme 1, compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula (II) with a suitable amine. Conveniently reaction is effected by using an excess of the amine or stoichiometric quantity of the amine in the presence of a base such as a tertiary amine base (e.g. triethylamine or N-ethyl-N-isopropylpropan-2-amine); optionally in the presence of a suitable solvent (e.g. dimethyl sulphoxide or 1-methylpyrrolidin-2-one); optionally in the presence of a catalyst (such as caesium fluoride); and at elevated temperature, such as 120° C. to 150° C.\n\n\nCompounds of formula (II) may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula (III) with a suitable amine. Conveniently reaction is effected by using an excess of the amine or stoichiometric quantity of the amine in the presence of a base such as a tertiary amine base (e.g. triethylamine or N-ethyl-N-isopropylpropan-2-amine); in the presence of a suitable solvent (e.g. ethanol, 2-propanol or 1-methylpyrrolidin-2-one); and at ambient or elevated temperature, such as ambient temperature to 85° C.\n\n\nAccording to scheme 1, the groups X and Y represent a halogen atom (e.g. chlorine) or an alternative leaving group such as a sulphonate ester (e.g. 4-methylphenyl sulphonate) or a sulphonyl group (e.g. methane sulphonyl or phenyl sulphonyl) or a sulphinyl group (e.g. methane sulphinyl).\n\n\nIt will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the transformations described may be carried out in a manner that does not require the isolation or purification of the intermediate compound of formula (II) but that requires sequential addition of suitable amines, with or without additional base (e.g. triethylamine or N-ethyl-N-isopropylpropan-2-amine) or solvent, to a compound or formula (III) in the presence of a suitable solvent (e.g. 1-methylpyrrolidin-2-one or dimethyl sulphoxide) with or without heating the reaction mixture between the addition of the two amines, and with or without the addition of a catalyst (such as caesium fluoride).\n\n\nIt will be further appreciated by those skilled in the art that it may be necessary or desirable to carry out the transformations described in the schemes in a different order from that described, or to modify one or more of the transformations, to provide the desired compound of formula (I).\n\n\nIt will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, as illustrated in the schemes above, it may be necessary or desirable at any stage in the synthesis of compounds of formula (I) to protect one or more sensitive groups in the molecule so as to prevent undesirable side reactions. In particular, it may be necessary or desirable to protect amino groups. The protecting groups used in the preparation of compounds of formula (I) may be used in conventional manner. See, for example, those described in ‘Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis’ by Theodora W Green and Peter G M Wuts, third edition, (John Wiley and Sons, 1999), in particular chapter 7, pages 494-653 (“Protection for the Amino Group”), incorporated herein by reference, which also describes methods for the removal of such groups.\n\n\nCompounds of formula (III) are known in the literature or easily prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention intended for pharmaceutical use may be administered as crystalline or amorphous products. They may be obtained, for example, as solid plugs, powders, or films by methods such as precipitation, crystallization, freeze drying, spray drying, or evaporative drying. Microwave or radio frequency drying may be used for this purpose.\n\n\nThey may be administered alone or in combination with one or more other compounds of the invention or in combination with one or more other drugs (or as any combination thereof). Generally, they will be administered as a formulation in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The term ‘excipient’ is used herein to describe any ingredient other than the compound(s) of the invention. The choice of excipient will to a large extent depend on factors such as the particular mode of administration, the effect of the excipient on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosage form.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for the delivery of compounds of the present invention and methods for their preparation will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Such compositions and methods for their preparation may be found, for example, in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n19th Edition (Mack Publishing Company, 1995).\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be administered orally. Oral administration may involve swallowing, so that the compound enters the gastrointestinal tract, or buccal or sublingual administration may be employed by which the compound enters the blood stream directly from the mouth.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for oral administration include solid formulations such as tablets, capsules containing particulates, liquids, or powders, lozenges (including liquid-filled), chews, multi- and nano-particulates, gels, solid solution, liposome, films, ovules, sprays and liquid formulations.\n\n\nLiquid formulations include suspensions, solutions, syrups and elixirs. Such formulations may be employed as fillers in soft or hard capsules and typically comprise a carrier, for example, water, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, methylcellulose, or a suitable oil, and one or more emulsifying agents and/or suspending agents. Liquid formulations may also be prepared by the reconstitution of a solid, for example, from a sachet.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may also be used in fast-dissolving, fast-disintegrating dosage forms such as those described in Expert Opinion in Therapeutic Patents, 11 (6), 981-986, by Liang and Chen (2001).\n\n\nFor tablet dosage forms, depending on dose, the drug may make up from 1 weight % to 80 weight % of the dosage form, more typically from 5 weight % to 60 weight % of the dosage form. In addition to the drug, tablets generally contain a disintegrant. Examples of disintegrants include sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polyvinylpyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, lower alkyl-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, starch, pregelatinised starch and sodium alginate. Generally, the disintegrant will comprise from 1 weight % to 25 weight %, preferably from 5 weight % to 20 weight % of the dosage form.\n\n\nBinders are generally used to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet formulation. Suitable binders include microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, sugars, polyethylene glycol, natural and synthetic gums, polyvinylpyrrolidone, pregelatinised starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Tablets may also contain diluents, such as lactose (monohydrate, spray-dried monohydrate, anhydrous and the like), mannitol, xylitol, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, starch and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate.\n\n\nTablets may also optionally comprise surface active agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate 80, and glidants such as silicon dioxide and talc. When present, surface active agents may comprise from 0.2 weight % to 5 weight % of the tablet, and glidants may comprise from 0.2 weight % to 1 weight % of the tablet.\n\n\nTablets also generally contain lubricants such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate, and mixtures of magnesium stearate with sodium lauryl sulphate. Lubricants generally comprise from 0.25 weight % to 10 weight %, preferably from 0.5 weight % to 3 weight % of the tablet.\n\n\nOther possible ingredients include anti-oxidants, colorants, flavouring agents, preservatives and taste-masking agents.\n\n\nExemplary tablets contain up to about 80% drug, from about 10 weight % to about 90 weight % binder, from about 0 weight % to about 85 weight % diluent, from about 2 weight % to about 10 weight % disintegrant, and from about 0.25 weight % to about 10 weight % lubricant.\n\n\nTablet blends may be compressed directly or by roller to form tablets. Tablet blends or portions of blends may alternatively be wet-, dry-, or melt-granulated, melt congealed, or extruded before tabletting. The final formulation may comprise one or more layers and may be coated or uncoated; it may even be encapsulated.\n\n\nThe formulation of tablets is discussed in \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets\n, Vol. 1, by H. Lieberman and L. Lachman (Marcel Dekker, New York, 1980).\n\n\nConsumable oral films for human or veterinary use are typically pliable water-soluble or water-swellable thin film dosage forms which may be rapidly dissolving or mucoadhesive and typically comprise a compound of formula (I), a film-forming polymer, a binder, a solvent, a humectant, a plasticiser, a stabiliser or emulsifier, a viscosity-modifying agent and a solvent. Some components of the formulation may perform more than one function.\n\n\nThe compound of formula (I) may be water-soluble or insoluble. A water-soluble compound typically comprises from 1 weight % to 80 weight %, more typically from 20 weight % to 50 weight %, of the solutes. Less soluble compounds may comprise a greater proportion of the composition, typically up to 88 weight % of the solutes. Alternatively, the compound of formula (I) may be in the form of multiparticulate beads.\n\n\nThe film-forming polymer may be selected from natural polysaccharides, proteins, or synthetic hydrocolloids and is typically present in the range 0.01 to 99 weight %, more typically in the range 30 to 80 weight %.\n\n\nOther possible ingredients include anti-oxidants, colorants, flavourings and flavour enhancers, preservatives, salivary stimulating agents, cooling agents, co-solvents (including oils), emollients, bulking agents, anti-foaming agents, surfactants and taste-masking agents.\n\n\nFilms in accordance with the invention are typically prepared by evaporative drying of thin aqueous films coated onto a peelable backing support or paper. This may be done in a drying oven or tunnel, typically a combined coater dryer, or by freeze-drying or vacuuming.\n\n\nSolid formulations for oral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\nSuitable modified release formulations for the purposes of the invention are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,106,864. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles are to be found in \nPharmaceutical Technology On\n-\nline, \n25(2), 1-14, by Verma et al (2001). The use of chewing gum to achieve controlled release is described in WO 00/35298.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered directly into the blood stream, into muscle, or into an internal organ. Suitable means for parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular and subcutaneous. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques.\n\n\nParenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a sterile non-aqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water.\n\n\nThe preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions, for example, by lyophilisation, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe solubility of compounds of formula (I) used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents.\n\n\nFormulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Thus compounds of the invention may be formulated as a solid, semi-solid, or thixotropic liquid for administration as an implanted depot providing modified release of the active compound. Examples of such formulations include drug-coated stents and poly(dl-lactic-coglycolic)acid (PGLA) microspheres.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered topically to the skin or mucosa, that is, dermally or transdermally. Typical formulations for this purpose include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, wafers, implants, sponges, fibres, bandages and microemulsions. Liposomes may also be used. Typical carriers include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Penetration enhancers may be incorporated—see, for example, J Pharm Sci, 88 (10), 955-958, by Finnin and Morgan (October 1999).\n\n\nOther means of topical administration include delivery by electroporation, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, sonophoresis and microneedle or needle-free (e.g. Powderject™, Bioject™, etc.) injection.\n\n\nFormulations for topical administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler or as an aerosol spray from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane. For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin.\n\n\nThe pressurised container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebuliser contains a solution or suspension of the compound(s) of the invention comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilising, or extending release of the active, a propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactic acid.\n\n\nPrior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisation, or spray drying.\n\n\nCapsules (made, for example, from gelatin or hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as/-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.\n\n\nA suitable solution formulation for use in an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1 μg to 20 mg of the compound of the invention per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1 μl to 100 μl. A typical formulation may comprise a compound of formula (I), propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.\n\n\nSuitable flavours, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for inhaled/intranasal administration.\n\n\nFormulations for inhaled/intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release using, for example, PGLA. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\nIn the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve which delivers a metered amount or the drug product is packaged as discrete single dose units for use in the inhaler device. Units in accordance with the invention are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or “puff” containing from 1 μg to 4000 μg of the compound of formula (I). The overall daily dose will typically be in the range 1 μg to 20 mg which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the day.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be administered rectally or vaginally, for example, in the form of a suppository, pessary, or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, but various alternatives may be used as appropriate.\n\n\nFormulations for rectal/vaginal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronised suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, biodegradable (e.g. absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (e.g. silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis.\n\n\nFormulations for ocular/aural administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted, or programmed release.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.\n\n\nDrug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubiliser. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in International Patent Applications Nos. WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148.\n\n\nInasmuch as it may desirable to administer a combination of active compounds, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound in accordance with the invention, may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions.\n\n\nThus the kit of the invention comprises two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of formula (I) in accordance with the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like.\n\n\nThe kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically comprises directions for administration and may be provided with a so-called memory aid.\n\n\nFor administration to human patients, the total daily dose of the compounds of the invention is typically in the range 0.001 mg to 2000 mg depending, of course, on the mode of administration. For example, oral administration may require a total daily dose of from 0.1 mg to 2000 mg, while an intravenous dose may only require from 0.01 mg to 100 mg. The total daily dose may be administered in single or divided doses and may, at the physician's discretion, fall outside of the typical range given herein.\n\n\nThese dosages are based on an average human subject having a weight of about 60 kg to 70 kg. The physician will readily be able to determine doses for subjects whose weight falls outside this range, such as infants and the elderly.\n\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, references herein to “treatment” include references to curative, palliative and prophylactic treatment.\n\n\nAccording to another embodiment of the present invention, the compounds of the invention can also be used as a combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents to be co-administered to a patient to obtain some particularly desired therapeutic end result. The second and more additional therapeutic agents may also be a compound of the formula (I) or a pharmaceutically and/or veterinarily acceptable derivative thereof, or one or more histamine H\n4 \nreceptor ligands known in the art. More typically, the second and more therapeutic agents will be selected from a different class of therapeutic agents.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “co-administration”, “co-administered” and “in combination with”, referring to the compounds of the invention and one or more other therapeutic agents, is intended to mean, and does refer to and include the following:\n\n \n \n \n \nsimultaneous administration of such combination of compound(s) of formula (I) and therapeutic agent(s) to a patient in need of treatment, when such components are formulated together into a single dosage form which releases said components at substantially the same time to said patient,\n \nsubstantially simultaneous administration of such combination of compound(s) of formula (I) and therapeutic agent(s) to a patient in need of treatment, when such components are formulated apart from each other into separate dosage forms which are taken at substantially the same time by said patient, whereupon said components are released at substantially the same time to said patient,\n \nsequential administration of such combination compound(s) of formula (I) and therapeutic agent(s) to a patient in need of treatment, when such components are formulated apart from each other into separate dosage forms which are taken at consecutive times by said patient with a significant time interval between each administration, whereupon said components are released at substantially different times to said patient;

According to this invention H\n4 \nligands are meant to include H\n4 \nreceptor antagonists, agonists and inverse agonists. For the preferred indications to be treated according to the invention, H\n4 \nantagonists are believed to be most suitable.\n\n\nTherefore, a further aspect of the present invention relates to the compounds of formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, derived forms or compositions thereof, for use as medicaments, more particularly in the treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions in which the H\n4 \nreceptor is involved. More specifically, the present invention also concerns the compounds of the invention for use in the treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions selected from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n \n \ninflammatory diseases;\n \nrespiratory diseases (e.g. adult respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, asthma, emphysema, rhinitis, chronic sinusitis), allergy, allergy-induced airway responses, allergic rhinitis, viral rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis, perennial and seasonal rhinitis, nasal congestion, allergic congestion;\n \nfemale and male sexual dysfunction;\n \nskin diseases such as dermatitis and psoriasis;\n \ncardiac dysfunctions such as myocardial ischaemia and arrythmia;\n \ndiseases of the gastrointestinal tract such as inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease and colitis ulcerosa;\n \ncancer;\n \nrheumatoid arthritis;\n \nhypotension;\n \ninflammatory pain and\n \noveractive bladder conditions.\n \n \n \n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention are particularly suitable for the treatment of asthma, allergy, allergy-induced airway responses, allergic rhinitis, viral rhinitis, non-allergic rhinitis, perennial and seasonal rhinitis, nasal congestion and allergic congestion.\n\n\nA still further aspect of the present invention also relates to the use of the compounds of the invention for the manufacture of a drug being a H\n4 \nligand. In particular, the present inventions concerns the use of the compounds of formula (I), or pharmaceutically and/or veterinarily acceptable derivatives thereof, for the manufacture of a drug for the treatment of H\n4 \nmediated diseases and/or conditions, in particular the diseases and/or conditions listed above.\n\n\nAs a consequence, the present invention provides a particularly interesting method to treat a mammal, including a human being, with an effective amount of a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically and/or veterinarily acceptable derivative thereof. More precisely, the present invention provides a particularly interesting method for the treatment of a H\n4 \nmediated diseases and/or conditions in a mammal, including a human being, in particular the diseases and/or conditions listed above, comprising administering to said mammal an effective amount of a compound of the invention.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they are more potent, have a longer duration of action, have a broader range of activity, are more stable, are easier and/or safer to prepare, have fewer side effects or are more selective, or have other more useful properties than the compounds of the prior art.\n\n\nThe following examples illustrate the preparation of compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention\n\n\n \n1\nH Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were in all cases consistent with the proposed structures.

\nBinding\n\n\n\n\n\nCell pellets from CHO cells expressing the histamine H\n4 \nreceptor were homogenised in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl/0.5 mM CaCl\n2 \nbuffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche®, United Kingdom) using a ground glass homogeniser. Homogenates were centrifuged at 48000 g for 30 min at 4° C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in fresh buffer and the centrifugation step was repeated as described above. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl in the same volume as the original cell pellet. Aliquots of membrane preparations were stored at −80° C. and were used for [\n3\nH]-Histamine binding experiments.\n\n\nMethod 1\n\n\nCell membranes (20-35 μg/well) were incubated for 90 minutes shaking at room temperature with 3 nM [2,5-\n3\nH]Histamine dihydrochloride (30-60 Ci/mmol) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), with or without competing H\n4 \nligands. The reaction was terminated by rapid filtration through 0.5% polyethylenimine-soaked Unifilter GF/B plates (Packard) followed by three washes with 1 ml ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl. Filters were dried for 45 min at 45° C. and bound radiolabel was determined using scintillation counting techniques. Non-specific binding was defined with 10 μM JNJ7777120. For competition binding studies, Ki values were calculated form the IC\n50 \nvalue based on an experimentally determined ligand K\nd \nof 5.2 nM and a ligand concentration of 5 nM according to the Cheng-Prussoff equation where; K\ni\n=(IC\n50\n)/(1+([L]/K\nd\n)).\n\n\nMethod 2\n\n\nCell membranes (15 μg/well) were pre-incubated for 120 min shaking at 4° C. with Ysi WGA beads (250 μg/well) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) followed by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes and resuspension in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The membrane/bead mixture (15 μg membrane/250 μg beads well) was incubated for 90 minutes shaking at room temperature with 6.5 nM [2,5-\n3\nH] Histamine dihydrochloride (30-60 Ci/mmol) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), with or without competing H\n4 \nligands. Non-specific binding was defined with 10 μM JNJ7777120. Bound radiolabel was determined using scintillation counting techniques after 90 minutes. For competition binding studies, Ki values were calculated from the IC\n50 \nvalue based on an experimentally determined ligand K\nd \nof 5.2 nM and a ligand concentration of 5 nM according to the Cheng-Prussoff equation where; K\ni\n=(IC\n50\n)/(1+([L]/K\nd\n)).\n\n\nThe compounds of the Examples have been tested in the H\n4 \nbinding assay described above using either method 1 or method 2.
