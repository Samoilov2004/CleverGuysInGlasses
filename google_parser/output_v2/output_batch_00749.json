Description\n\n\n\n\n FGF21 DERIVATIVES WITH ALBUMIN BINDER A-B-C-D-E- AND THEIR USE\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21 ), more in particular to derivatives of FGF21 compounds having an albumin binder of the formula A-B- C-D-E- covalently attached. The invention also relates to novel FGF21 analogues, as well as to the pharmaceutical use of these FGF21 derivatives and analogues, in particular for the treatment of diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and/or Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).\n\n\nThe derivatives of the invention are protracted, e.g. capable of maintaining a low blood glucose level for a longer period of time, capable of increasing the in vivo half-life of FGF21 , and/or result in a lower clearance of FGF21. The derivatives of the invention are preferably furthermore of an improved oxidative stability.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nFibroblast growth factors are polypeptides expressed in developing and adult tissues. They are involved in several physiological mechanisms including for example metabolic regulation and cellular differentiation. A whole family of more than twenty fibroblast growth factors exists (the FGF family). Three members of the FGF family including FGF19, FGF21 , and FGF23 form a subfamily functioning as endocrine factors involved in metabolic regulation. Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 or FGF-21 , herein for short FGF21 , is expressed preferentially in the liver and has been shown to exert hormone-like metabolic effects.\n\n\nFor example, FGF21 has been demonstrated to activate glucose uptake in mouse adipocytes, to protect mice from diet induced obesity when over-expressed in transgenic mice, and to lower blood glucose and triglyceride levels when administered to diabetic rodents (Kharitonenkov et a/., J. CHn. Invest. (2005), 1 15:1627-1635).\n\n\nThe lowering effect of FGF21 on blood glucose and triglycerides has also been shown in diabetic monkeys. FGF21 was also able to decrease LDL and to increase HDL significantly in diabetic monkeys (Kharitonenkov et al., Endocrinology (2007), 148(2):774-81 ).\n\n\nIn diet induced obese mice and ob/ob mice, FGF21 was furthermore shown to lower body weight, predominantly by an increase in energy expenditure and a reduction in adiposity (Coskun et al., Endocrinology (2008), 149(12): 6018-6027).\n\n\nBased on these results FGF21 has been suggested as a pharmacological agent with the potential to treat diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and \n\n metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome includes aspects like insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, visceral obesity and hypertension, see e.g. the definition of metabolic syndrome in Grundy et al., Circulation (2004), (109): 433-438.\n\n\nFGF21 may furthermore be used as a pharmacological agent with a potential to treat Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), see Coskun et al. Endocrinology, 2008 cited above, and Xu et al., Diabetes (2009, 58(1 ):250-9, published electronically 07-OCT- 2008 ahead of print). NAFLD has been defined by Erickson, J. Lipid Res. (2008), published electronically 12-DEC-2008 ahead of print.\n\n\nYie et al. studied the role of the N- and C-termini of FGF21 in receptor interaction and activation, see FEBS Letters, 583 (2009), 19-24.\n\n\nWO 2003/011213 A2 discloses a method for treating diabetes of type 1 and 2, or obesity, by use of FGF21 compounds with at least 95% identity to the FGF21 precursor amino acid sequence.\n\n\nWO 2003/061712 A1 discloses muteins of FGF21 with improved pharmaceutical properties, e.g. A145E.\n\n\nWO 2005/091944 A2 discloses PEGylated derivatives of FGF21 , FGF21-K59C, and FGF21-K122C.\n\n\nWO 2005/1 13606 A2 discloses various FGF21 fusion proteins with the Fc portion of an lgG4 immunoglobulin, or human serum albumin. WO 2006/028595 A2 discloses further muteins of FGF21 with reduced capacity of\n\n\nO-glycosylation when expressed in yeast, e.g. L118C-A134C-S167A.\n\n\nWO 2006/028714 A1 discloses additional muteins of FGF21 with reduced susceptibility for proteolytic degradation when expressed in yeast, e.g. L153I.\n\n\nWO 2006/065582 A2 discloses still further muteins of FGF21 with reduced deamidation, e.g. des-HPIP-L118C-A134C-N121 D.\n\n\nWO 2006/078463 A2 discloses a method for treating cardiovascular disease by use of native mature FGF21 or specified variants thereof.\n\n\nWO 2008/121563 discloses FGF21 polypeptides modified to include non-naturally encoded amino acids, as well as derivatives thereof.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nBriefly, this invention is as defined in claim 1 below.\n\n\nThe present invention relates to derivatives of FGF21 compounds having an albumin binder covalently attached to the FGF21 compound, wherein the albumin binder has the formula A-B-C-D-E-, in which component A is a fatty acid or a derivative thereof. The \n\n invention also relates to novel FGF21 analogues, as well as the use of the derivatives and analogues of the invention in pharmaceutical compositions, in particular for the treatment of diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and/or Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).\n\n\nThe derivatives of the invention are protracted, e.g. capable of maintaining a low blood glucose level for a longer period of time, capable of increasing the in vivo half-life of FGF21 , and/or result in a lower clearance of FGF21. The protracted FGF21 derivatives retain satisfactory biological activity and may be administered less frequently. The derivatives are preferably furthermore of an improved oxidative stability.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to derivatives of an FGF21 compound having an albumin binder of the formula A-B-C-D-E- covalently attached, wherein A- is an element of formula I, Il or III:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(formula I), (formula II) or \n\n\n\n\n\n(formula III); wherein n is 8, 9,10, 1 1 , 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 or 19, and \n*\n is the point of attachment to B-;\n\n\n-B- is absent, represents a bond or is selected from -B1-, -B2- or combinations thereof, wherein -B1- is an element of formula IV, V, Vl or VII:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(formula IV or Trx), (formula V or Inp),\n\n\n \n\n (formula Vl) or (formula VII); \n\n wherein \n*\n is the point of attachment to -B2- or -C-, and # is the point of attachment to A- or -B2-; and\n\n\n-B2- is an element of formula NX, IX or XXVI 11 or a combination of up to four elements of formula NX and/or formula IX and/or formula XXVIII:\n\n\n \n\n (formula NX), wherein b is 0, 1 or 2, c is 0, 1 or 2, with the proviso that b is 1 or 2 when c is 0, and b is 0 when c is 1 or 2, \n*\n is the point of attachment to -C-, -B1- or another -B2-, and # is the point of attachment to A-, -B1- or another -B2-;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(formula IX), wherein d is 1 or 2, e is 0, 1 or 2, \n*\n is the point of attachment to -C- or -B1-, and # is the point of attachment to A- or -B1-; or\n\n\n#-N H-SO\n2\n-(CH\n2\n)\nU\n-CO-* (formula XXVIII) wherein u is 2, 3 or 4, \n*\n is the point of attachment to -C- or -B1-, and # is the point of attachment to A- or -B1-;\n\n\n-C- is absent, represents a bond or is an element of formula X or Xl:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(formula X), wherein p is 0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, q is 0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, \n*\n is the point of attachment to -D-, -E- or the FGF21 compound, and # is the point of attachment to -B-; or\n\n\n \n\n (formula Xl), \n\n wherein k is 0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 1 1 or 23, m is 0, 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, \n*\n is the point of attachment to - D-, -E- or the FGF21 compound; and # is the point of attachment to -B-; -D- is absent, represents a bond or is an element of formula XII or XIII:\n\n\n#-NH-(CH\n2\n)\nr\n-NH-CO-(CH\n2\n)\ns\n-* (formula XII) or\n\n\n#-NH-(CH\n2\n)r* (formula XIII), wherein r is 2, 3, 4 or 5, s is 1 , 2, 3 or 4, t is 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, \n*\n is the point of attachment to - E- or the FGF21 compound, and # is the point of attachment to -C-;\n\n\n-E- is absent, represents a bond or is an element of formula XXII, XXIII, XXIIIa, XXIV, XXIVa, XXV\n1\n XXVI or XXVI I:\n\n\n \n\n (formula XXII), (formula XXIII), (formula\n\n\nXXIIIa), \n\n\n (formula XXIV), (formula\n\n\nXXIVa), \n\n\n (formula XXV), (formula XXVI) or\n\n\n \n~\n* (formula XXVII), wherein \n*\n is the point of attachment to the FGF21 compound, and # is the point of attachment to -D- or -C-; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\nThe invention also relates to novel FGF21 analogues comprising (a) at least one of the following modifications as compared to SEQ ID NO:1 : -1 G, -1 C, -1S, S6C, S6K, A26E, Q27E, Q28R, A31 E, K56R, K59R, K69R, S71 C, D102T, K122R, I152K, L166F, S167G, M168L, V169aT, P171 L, S172E, Q173A, G174V, Y179F, A180E, and/or S181 K,R; independently optionally with an N-terminal M (e.g., -1 M); and/or (b) an N-terminal extension as compared to SEQ ID NO:1 of up to 25 amino acid residues, preferably up to 20 amino acid residues, more preferably up to 15 amino acid residues, even more preferably up to 10 \n\n amino acid residues, or most preferably up to 6 amino acid residues, wherein at least 50%, preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, even more preferably at least 80%, or most preferably at least 90% of the N-terminally extending amino acid residues are G or S. SEQ ID NO:1 is the mature wild type human FGF21 peptide having 181 amino acid residues. Finally, the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of the analogues or derivatives of the invention, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; as well as to methods for treating a patient exhibiting diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and/or Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of an analogue, derivative or composition of the invention.\n\n\nIn a first aspect, the derivative of the invention has an albumin binder of the formula A-B-C-D-E- covalently attached to a thiol group of the FGF21 compound, i.e. to a cysteine residue.\n\n\nIn a second aspect, the derivative of the invention has an albumin binder of the formula A-B-C- covalently attached to an amino group of the FGF21 compound, which can be the N-terminal amino group, and/or an internal amino group such as the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue.\n\n\nThe derivatives of this invention and the analogues of this invention shall have biological effect similar to that of FGF21 , for example, in relation to glucose lowering effect, improvement in dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and/or Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD)\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n\nThe term \"FGF21 compound\" as used herein refers to native human FGF21 as well as analogues thereof. The sequence of the native human FGF21 protein is available from the UNIPROT database with accession no. Q9NSA1. The 209 amino acid precursor protein includes a signal peptide (amino acids 1-28) and a mature protein (amino acids 29-209). The mature protein is included herein as SEQ ID NO:1 (amino acids 1-181 ), and the signal peptide as\n\n\nSEQ ID NO:2 (amino acids 1-28). An isoform or allelic form of native human FGF21 having a Pro instead of Leu in the mature protein at position 146 of SEQ ID NO:1 herein is known from, i.a., US2001012628 A1\n\n\n(residue no. 174 of SEQ ID NO:2 in the published US application). \n\n Another isoform having a shorter signal peptide in which Leu at position 23 of SEQ ID NO:2 herein is missing is known from WO 2003/011213 (see SEQ ID NO: 2 of the WO publication having a signal peptide of 27 amino acid residues).\n\n\nThus, particular examples of native human FGF21 are: SEQ ID NO:1 , SEQ ID NO:1 having the substitution L146P, as well as any of these sequences preceded by the 27 or 28 amino acids signal peptide referred to above. Preferred examples of native human FGF21 are the mature parts, viz. SEQ ID NO:1 and the L146P isoform thereof.\n\n\nThe term \"analogue\" as referred to herein in the context of FGF21 , i.e., an FGF21 analogue, refers to polypeptides that are or can be, deduced or derived from native FGF21 , from SEQ ID NO:1 in particular, by modification of the amino acid sequence thereof. Such modification, amendment or change may include substitution, deletion, and/or addition of one or more amino acids. For example, amino acids may be added and/or deleted at the C- terminus, at the N-terminus, or internally in the amino acid sequence. Preferably amino acids are added and/or deleted at the C- and/or N-terminus, more preferably at the N-terminus. Amino acid sequences with C- or N-terminally deleted amino acids may also be referred to as truncated sequences, as is known in the art. Likewise, amino acids added internally in the sequence may be referred to as insertions. The term \"variant\" or \"mutein\" is now and then used herein instead of the term \"analogue\".\n\n\nOne example of an FGF21 analogue is the truncated form of native mature FGF21 in which the four N-terminal amino acid residues of the mature protein (HPIP) are removed, which is disclosed in, e.g., WO 2006/065582. This truncated form is said to stimulate glucose uptake in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes at the same level as the wild-type FGF21. This protein has the amino acid sequence of amino acids 5-181 of SEQ ID NO:1 herein.\n\n\nA further example of an FGF21 analogue is the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:1 which has an N-terminal Met (also designated \"Met-FGF21\" or as substitution -1 M ((minus 1 )M) of SEQ ID NO:1 ). An N-terminal Met is added when FGF21 compound is expressed in E. coli, see e.g. WO 2006/050247, Table 6.\n\n\nOther examples of FGF21 analogues are the modified FGF21 sequences (often called muteins) which are disclosed in e.g. WO 2003/061712, WO 2005/091944, WO 2006/028595, WO 2006/028714, WO 2006/065582 and WO 2008/121563 (cf. the background art section herein).\n\n\nStill further examples of FGF21 analogues are disclosed in the experimental part herein, as well as in the appended claims.\n\n\nThe term \"amino acid\" or \"amino acid residue\" as referred to herein in the context of FGF21 modifications includes the twenty standard alpha-amino acids being used by cells in \n\n protein biosynthesis and specified by the genetic code, viz. alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine. The term also includes non-standard amino acids, such as selenocysteine and pyrrolysine which are also encoded by the genetic code but rare in proteins. Other non-standard amino acids found in proteins may be formed by post-translational modification, for example γ-carboxy- glutamate and hydroxyproline. Additional examples of non-standard or non-natural amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code are ornithine and phosphoserine. Still further examples of non-standard amino acids are synthetic amino acids including amino acids manufactured by chemical synthesis, e.g. D-isomers of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code such as D-alanine, D-glutamine, D-histidine, and D-leucine, Aib (α-amino- isobutyric acid), Abu (α-aminobutyric acid), Tie (tert-butylglycine), β-alanine, 3-aminomethyl benzoic acid, anthranilic acid, des-amino-histidine (abbreviated DesaminoHis, alternative name imidazopropionic acid, abbreviated Impr), the beta analogues of amino acids such as β-alanine, 2-amino-histidine, β-hydroxy-histidine, homohistidine, Nα-acetyl-histidine, α-fluoro- methyl-histidine, α-methyl-histidine, α,α-dimethyl-glutamic acid, m-CF\n3\n-phenylalanine (abbreviated m-CF\n3\n-Phe), α,β-diaminopropionic acid (abbreviated Dap), 3-pyridylalanine, 2- pyridylalanine or 4-pyridylalanine, (i-aminocyclopropyl)carboxylic acid, (1-aminocyclobutyl)- carboxylic acid, (i-aminocyclopentyl)carboxylic acid, (i-aminocyclohexyl)carboxylic acid, (1- aminocycloheptyl)carboxylic acid, and (i-aminocyclooctyl)carboxylic acid.\n\n\nFor the present purposes the two recognized codes of the standard amino acids (one-letter and three-letter) are used interchangeably, or now and then the amino acid name is fully spelled out. These terms are of course considered fully equivalent (e.g. S = Ser = serine). The term \"derivative\" as used herein refers to an FGF21 compound which has been covalently modified. The term is not limiting as such, rather descriptive, as it is intended to mark a distinction between changes made to the constituent FGF21 polypeptide compound as such (\"analogues\"), and the covalent binding of a side chain to the FGF21 compound, whereby the compound is \"derivatised\". If desired, this term can be substituted with other general chemical terms, for example compound.\n\n\nThe term \"albumin binder\" is also not intended to be limiting as such. Again, it is rather descriptive, as it reflects the overall aim or purpose of attaching the A-B-C-D-E- chain to the FGF21 compound, viz. that the resulting compound (derivative) is capable of binding to human serum albumin which provides or at least contributes to the protracted effect aimed \n\n at for the derivatives of the invention. If desired, this term can also be substituted with other general chemical terms, for example compound.\n\n\nNomenclature: Analogues and derivatives are named herein using, interchangeably, polypeptide nomenclature, organic chemical nomenclature, and chemical formulas, or mixtures thereof, whatever is deemed best suited for easing the understanding of the technical matter in question. For example, the derivative of Example 4 may be named S-122- [1-(2-{2-[2-(2-{2-[2-(2-{2-[(S)-4-carboxy-4-(17-carboxy-heptadecanoylamino)-butyrylamino]- ethoxyl-ethoxyJ-acetylaminoJ-ethoxyl-ethoxyJ-acetylaminoJ-ethylcarbamoyll-ethyl^.S-dioxo- pyrrolidin-3-yl] [Cys122]-Met-FGF21 (meaning that [Cys122] Met-FGF21 is modified by 1-(2- {2-[2-(2-{2-[2-(2-{2-[(S)-4-carboxy-4-(17-carboxy-heptadecanoylamino)-butyrylamino]- ethoxyj-ethoxy^acetylaminol-ethoxyj-ethoxy^acetylaminol-ethylcarbamoylj-ethyl^^-dioxo- pyrrolidin-3-yl at the thiol group in Cys in position 122) . But this compound may also be defined as K122C Met-FGF21 , derivatised at C122 with the followings compound: \n\n\n Variant nomenclature (Nomenclature of analogues): Variants (or analogues) of\n\n\nFGF21 are named herein using, interchangeably, polypeptide nomenclature, organic chemical nomenclature, chemical formulas, amino acid sequences, or a mix thereof, whatever is deemed best suited for easing the understanding of the technical matter in question. For example, a substitution in a variant may be indicated as: Original amino acid- position-substituted amino acid\". The three or one letter code may be used. Accordingly, the notation \"K122C\" or \"Lys122Cys\" means, that the variant comprises a substitution of lysine with cysteine in the variant amino acid position corresponding to the amino acid at position 122 in FGF21 (SEQ ID NO:1 ), when the variant and FGF21 are aligned as described further below (\"alignment\").\n\n\nMultiple modifications such as e.g. substitutions may be separated by commas (with a space after the comma), and if desired surrounded by brackets in order to make it clear that they belong to the same variant. The analogue which is derivatised in Example 7 may for example be designated \"K56R, K59R, K69R, K122R Met-FGF21 \" or \"(K56R, K59R, K69R, K122R) Met-FGF21\" or it may be referred to as \"SEQ ID NO:1 with K56R, K59R, K69R, and K122R and an N-terminal M\". See Compound Y of Example 2 for the nomenclature of a variant with multiple modifications in the form of a mix of substitutions and insertions. \n\n Alternative modifications such as alternative substituents at a given position may be separated by commas, as e.g. in the designation \"S181 K,R\", which means that the Ser at position 181 may be substituted with Lys or Arg.\n\n\nAn extension can be described by reference to SEQ ID NO:1 by addition of position numbers (continued positive numbers in the C-terminal end and negative numbers in the N- terminal end) or, more simply, by adding the amino acids of the extension in question, using the correct sequence thereof, to the compound in question, which is then often given a trivial name, such as FGF21 , again in order to ease the understanding of the relevant technical point. As an example the compound (s) MGGGGG-FGF21 designates the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:1 (FGF21 ) with a G at position -1 , a G at position -2, a G at position -3, a G at position -4, a G at position -5, and an M at position -6, by reference to SEQ ID NO:1. Likewise, the compound (q) MS-FGF21 (or Met-Ser-FGF21 ) designates the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:1 (FGF21 ) with an S at position -1 , and an M at position -2, by reference to SEQ ID NO:1. An insertion in a variant may be indicated as: \"Amino acid position number before the insertion-index-inserted amino acid\". The amino acid position number before the insertion refers to the amino acid position in FGF21 (SEQ ID NO:1 ) just before the gap, which is created when the variant and FGF21 are aligned as described further below (\"alignment\"). For the amino acids, the three or one letter code may be used. The index is a lower case letter in alphabetical order, e.g. \"a\" for the first inserted amino acid residue, \"b\" for the second inserted amino acid residue, etc., as applicable. Accordingly, the notation\"V169aT\" (or \"Val169aThr\") or simply \"169aT\" (or \"169aThr\") all mean, that the variant comprises an insertion of threonine after valine at position 169 in FGF21 (SEQ ID NO: 1 ), when the variant and FGF21 are aligned as described further below (\"alignment\"). In cases where there is an extra disulphide bridge in the FGF compound, the two\n\n\nCys are typed adjacent to each other and connected by a dash, as, e.g., in \"L118C-A134C\", where there is a disulphide bridge between the Cys in position 118 and the Cys in position 134.\n\n\nFor purposes of the present invention, the alignment of two amino acid sequences may be made using the Needle program from the EMBOSS package (http://emboss.org). A preferred version is 2.8.0. The Needle program implements the global alignment algorithm described in Needleman, S. B. and Wunsch, C. D. (1970) J. MoI. Biol. 48, 443-453.

Alternatively, FGF21 and FGF21 analogues, optionally with N-terminal extensions, can be expressed in yeast as follows:\n\n\nFGF21 with N-terminal amino acid extensions can be expressed in S. cerevisiae. In one embodiment, this requires strain design in which a strain disrupted in PMT2, PEP4 and YPS1 is created. This strain can be designed using classical techniques relying on homologous recombination allowing specific integration at the respective loci. FGF21 with N- terminal extension is coded for on an S. cerevisiae expression vector which can be maintained in S. cerevisiea. To direct the FGF21 analogue to the secretory pathway a pre- pro sequence including a signal peptide (for example the MFalpha pre-pro leader sequence) may be provided in the recombinant expression vector. This sequence is joined to the DNA encoding the FGF21 analogue in correct reading frame. This signal peptide ensures secretion to the media. Upstream and adjacent to the FGF21 analogue sequence a dibasic amino acid sequence is placed ensuring cleavage of the prepro sequence from the FGF21 analogue before secretion to the media. The cleavage is likely to be caused by KEX2 activity. The FGF21 analogue can be harvested from the media. The derivatives of an FGF compound and the FGF21 analogues can be, if desired, be formulated together with other medicaments such as insulin.\n\n\nAll the embodiments in the following chapter, i.e., embodiments 1-180, are according to claim 1 below, to the extent possible.\n\n\nFURTHER PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS\n\n\n1.

CL-173) are maintained in basal medium (DMEM (4500 mg/l Glucose) with 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and Penicillin/Streptomycin). The cells are not allowed to reach confluence and should be passed (transferred to new vials) before reaching approx. 60 % of confluency (by visual inspection).\n\n\nFor the glucose uptake assay, cells are plated 80,000 cells/well in a 24 well plate, or 20,000 cells/well in a 96 well plate, and when they reach confluency (high density, with a view to have differentiated adipose cells made), the medium is changed from basal medium to basal medium containing Troglitazone, IBMX, Dexamethasone (commercially available from, e.g., Sigma) and human insulin (commercially available from, e.g., Novo Nordisk A/S). The cells are used 7-14, preferably 7-10, days after initiation of differentiation. The cells are stimulated with increasing concentrations (0-300 nM) of the FGF21 polypeptides or derivatives of the invention for 20 hours in basal medium. Before addition of 3H-deoxy- glucose (in what follows: the tracer) the cells are washed in warm (approximately 37°C) assay buffer (PBS with 1 mM MgCI\n2\n and 2 mM CaCI\n2\n), HEPES and 0.1 % Human serum albumin) and the cells are incubated with the tracer for 1 hour. This incubation is terminated by washing twice in ice cold assay buffer. The cells are lysed with Triton X-100 and lysates transferred to a 96 wells plate, microscint-40 (commercially available from, e.g., Perkin Elmer) is added and amount of tracer counted in a TOP-counter (e.g. a Packard top-counter from Perkin Elmer).

The control (not oxidized Met-FGF21 ) was treated in the same way, however without H\n2\nO\n2\n. The reactions were terminated by desalting on a gel filtration column (Zeba or Superose 12) equilibrated in PBS.\n\n\nOxidation status and kinetics of the two Met residues (the N-terminal met in wild type Met-FGF21 , SEQ ID NO:1 with an N-terminal met, in what follows \"Met1 \", and Met168 in SEQ ID NO:1 , in what follows \"Met168\") was determined by peptide mapping using the digestive enzyme trypsin (see e.g. Patten, SMV et ai, Journal of biological chemistry, 274, 10268-10276, 1999), at an enzyme:substrate (i.e., trypsin:FGF21 ) ratio of 1 :100 (w/w) for 2- 18 h at 37°C. The resultant digests were quenched with 1 % TFA and mapped by reverse phase UPLC (Waters) on a C18 column. Peptide elution was monitored by absorbance at 214 nm. Peptides were collected, dried in a speed-vac, and reconstituted in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1 % formic acid. Mass spectrometry of collected peptides, digests and intact protein was carried out using MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics, autoflex II, ToF/ToF) and NanoES-MS (Q-ToF Ultima, Waters) using NanoES spray capillaries.\n\n\nAnalysis of non-oxidized and oxidized Met-FGF21 samples by UPLC demonstrated complete oxidation of the Met1 and Met168 residues to Met-S-oxide (sulfoxide) in the digests at 300 mM H\n2\nO\n2\n (1 h, 25°C). MALDI analysis of collected peptides confirmed sites of oxidation to the Met1 and Met168 containing peptides and the Met residues were shown to be oxidized to Met-S-oxide using MS/MS sequencing of the peptides. Similar oxidation kinetics of the two residues was observed in the presence of various hydrogen peroxide concentrations (25, 50, \n\n 100, 200, and 300 mM H\n2\nO\n2\n incubated for 30 min at 0\n0\nC) using MALDI and UPLC analysis. The half-lives determined by UPLC for peptide 1-18 and peptide 137-176 were 36.3 and 40.3 min, respectively. Oxidation products were also observed by direct analysis of the intact protein using NanoES-MS. The activity of oxidized Met-FGF21 was reduced to 10% compared to non-oxidized\n\n\nMet-FGF21 in the fat cell assay of Example 8.\n\n\nIn a similar way, the oxidation stability of a number of FGF21 compounds of the invention are determined, and the results are shown in Table 2 below. The oxidation conditions were 300 mM H\n2\nO\n2\n, 1 h, 25°C.\n\n\nTable 2: Potencv of FGF21 compounds\n\n\nFGF21 compound EC\n50\n relative to the EC\n50\n of Met-FGF21 (%)\n\n\nMet-FGF21 (control) (Compound A) 100\n\n\nMet-FGF21 + Oxidation 10\n\n\nGly-FGF21 88\n\n\nGly-FGF21-M168L 60\n\n\nMet-FGF21-M168L (Compound A1 ) 36\n\n\nExample 10: In vivo test of FGF21 compounds - pharmacodynamics\n\n\nThe db/db mouse is a mouse model for Type 2 diabetes. The mice lack the leptin receptor and they are characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, hyperphagia and obesity.\n\n\nMale db/db mice (9-11 weeks old) were used to measure the effect on blood glucose of the following FGF21 compounds: (I ) WiId type FGF21 (SEQ ID NO:1 with an N- terminal Met), (2) the K122C analogue of FGF21 with an N-terminal Met, derivatised at Cys122 with an albumin binder as described in Example 4 (in two dosages), and (3) the S71 C analogue of FGF21 with an N-terminal Met, derivatised at Cys71 with an albumin binder as described in Example 6. The analogues were expressed in E.coli as described in Examples 1-2 and purified as described in Example 3.\n\n\nThe compounds were administered s.c. 0.2-1.0 mg/kg in PBS once daily (dosing on day 1 , day 2 and day 3). The vehicle treated group (control) was treated with PBS, (250 ul/50 g mouse) s.c. once daily. Blood glucose levels were measured on day 0, 1 , 3, 4 and 5 using a glucose analyzer (Biosen 5040) based on the glucose oxidase method. On day 0 the blood \n\n glucose was measured in order to allocate the mice to 4 different groups, with 8-10 mice in each, with a mean blood glucose which does not significantly differ from each other. On day 1 , blood glucose was measured 2 hours after first dose. On day 3 blood glucose was measured 2 hours after the third dose. On day 4 blood glucose was measured 24 hours after the third dose. The blood sample on day 5 was taken, and blood glucose thus measured, 48 hours after the last (third) dose.\n\n\nThe results are shown in Table 3 below, in which blood glucose is indicated in mM (mean ± S.E.M (n=8 or 10).\n\n\nTable 3: Effect on Blood glucose in db/db mice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results show that the FGF21 derivatives of the invention are biologically active in vivo, viz. they effectively lower blood glucose as compared to the vehicle. The derivatives of the invention even seem to be more effective than wild type FGF21 with respect to their blood lowering capacity as well as the duration of action.\n\n\nExample 11 : In vivo test of FGF21 compounds - pharmacokinetics db/db mice\n\n\nThe pharmokinetic profile of FGF21 compounds of the invention (Compounds F, H, and O, prepared as described in Examples 4, 5 and 6, respectively) was evaluated in male db/db mice. Met-FGF21 (Compound A) was included for comparison at three different dose levels, viz. 0.125, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg subcutaneously.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention were tested at one dose level, viz. 0.5 mg/kg subcutaneously (approximately 24 nm/kg). Plasma levels of the comparative compound were followed for 6 hours, whereas plasma levels of the compounds of the invention were followed for 48 hours.\n\n\nPlasma JVz was estimated to be 1.3-1.7 hours for the comparative compound (1.4 hours when dosed 0.5 mg/kg, like the test compounds), 8.2 hours for Compound F, 15.9 hours for Compound H, and 14.6 hours for Compound O. \n\n Mini pig\n\n\nThe pharmokinetic profile of Met-FGF21 (Compound A), and an FGF21 compound of the invention (Compound F, prepared as described in Example 4) were tested in normal male Gottingen mini pigs, n=3-4, (12-15 months old, 25 kg). The plasma concentration of Compound A was monitored for one week, whereas the plasma concentration of Compound F was monitored for two weeks. Both compounds were dosed as a single intravenous dose of 0.1 mg/kg (approximately 5 nmol/kg).\n\n\nThe mean half-life (VA) of the comparative compound (Compound A) was 10.4 hours with a standard deviation of 3.1 hours, whereas the mean T14 of the compound of the invention (Compound F) was 91.9 hours, with a standard deviation of 17.1 hours.\n\n\nThe plasma levels of the FGF21 compounds were determined using Fibroblast Growth Factor-21 Human ELISA (available from BioVendor, catalogue no. RD191108200R). These results strongly confirm the protracted effect of the FGF21 derivatives of the invention.\n\n\nExample 12: Preparation of a further Cys derivative of an FGF21 analogue\n\n\nPreparation of the S71 C Met-FGF21 derivative S-71-({2-r2-(2-f2-r2-(2-f2-r(S)-4-carboxy-4- (i g-carboxy-nonadecanoylaminoVbutyrylaminol-ethoxyl-ethoxyVacetylaminol-ethoxy)- ethoxyVacetylaminol-ethylcarbamovD-methyl) [Cvs71l Met-FGF21 (Compound O)\n\n\nThe Cys residue at position 71 in the S71 C Met-FGF21 analogue, prepared as generally described in Examples 2 and 3 (SEQ ID NO:1 with S71 C and an N-terminal M), was modified at the thiol group with the following reagent: \n\n\n General procedure B\n\n\n[Cys71] Met-FGF21 (21.8 mg, 1.1 umol), freeze dried from NH\n4\nHCO\n3\n, was dissolved in 20 mM TRIS, 0.5 NaCI, pH 8.0 (4.36 ml). 19-{(S)-1-Carboxy-3-[2-(2-{[2-(2-{[2-(2-iodo- acetylamino^ethylcarbamoyO-methoxyϊ-ethoxy^ethylcarbamoyO-methoxyϊ-ethoxy^ethyl- carbamoyl]-propylcarbamoyl}-nonadecanoic acid (5.4 mg, 5eq), which was prepared as described above, was dissolved in 0.02M TRIS, 0.5M NaCI pH 8.0 buffer/acetonitrile 1 :1 (1.09 ml) and added to the solution of [Cys71] Met-FGF21.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe field of the invention relates to high throughput screening methods to provide specific probes that measure levels of unbound analytes, including unbound free fatty acids and other unbound metabolites. Also disclosed are probes obtained with the high throughput screening methods and the use of a combination of probes to determine an unbound free fatty acid profile or more generally an unbound metabolite profile for an individual.\n\n\n \n\n\nDescription of the Related Art\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor purposes of the present disclosure, fatty acids are non esterified carboxylated alkyl chains of 1-30 carbons atoms which may exist as neutral (e.g. protonated, sodium or potassium salt) or ionic species, depending upon the pH and conditions of the aqueous media. Free fatty acids (FFA) are equivalent to fatty acids and both terms refer to the totality of FFA including those in aqueous solution as monomers plus those that are not in solution (for example bound to other macromolecules (proteins, membranes), cells or part of an aggregate of FFA (micelles, soaps and other more complex aggregates). FFA present as monomers in aqueous solution (either charged or neutral) are referred to as unbound free fatty acids (FFAu). For the purposes of the present disclosure, probes are fluorescently labeled proteins that upon binding an analyte, such as a FFAu, reveal a measurable change in fluorescence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor purposes of the present disclosure, metabolites are physiologically important molecules whose molecular weight is approximately 2000 Da or less. These include molecules that occur naturally in the course of human or animal physiology or pathophysiology, and drug molecules and their metabolic products and nutrient molecules and their metabolic products. Similar to FFA and depending upon their solubility, a fraction of each metabolite is present as monomers in aqueous solution (either charged or neutral). We refer to this fraction as the unbound metabolite. For the purposes of the present disclosure, probes are fluorescently labeled proteins that reveal a measurable change in fluorescence upon binding to unbound metabolite.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the purposes of the present disclosure, the term \"lipid\" is taken to have its usual and customary meaning and defines a chemical compound which is most soluble in an organic solvent but has some level of solubility in the aqueous phase (the fraction that is unbound). Accordingly, a \"lipid-binding protein\" includes any protein capable of binding a lipid as lipid is defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLevels of unbound molecules, such as for example lipids, hormones and metabolic products, can provide information diagnostic of health and disease when measured in appropriate human or animal fluids. It is increasingly apparent that determination of the unbound (a.k.a 'aqueous phase' or 'free') concentration of such molecules provides critical information about physiologic homeostasis. Many metabolites are hydrophobic molecules with low aqueous solubility and unbound concentrations that are much lower than their \"total\" concentration, where the bulk of the \"total\" may be bound to proteins or cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntracellular lipid binding proteins (iLBP) are a family of low-molecular weight single chain polypeptides. There are four recognized subfamilies. Subfamily I contains proteins specific for vitamin A derivatives such as retinoic acid and retinol. Subfamily II contains proteins with specificities for bile acids, eiconsanoids, and heme. Subfamily III contains intestinal type fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) and Subfamily IV contains all other types of fatty acid binding protein (\nHaunerland, et al. (2004) Progress in Lipid Research vol. 43: 328-349\n). The entire family is characterized by a common 3-dimensional fold. Ligand binding properties of the different subfamilies overlap considerably. The wild type proteins of subfamilies I (\nRichieri et al (2000) Biochemistry 39:7197-7204\n) and II both bind fatty acids and those of subfamily II bind fatty acids as well as their native ligands. Moreover, single amino acid substitutions are able to interconvert the ligand binding properties of proteins of subfamilies I and II (\nJakoby et al (1993) Biochemistry 32:872-878\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,470,714\n \n and \n \nU.S. 6,444,432\n \n, which are incorporated herein by reference, describe probes for the determination of unbound free fatty acids (FFAu). These probes were constructed using either native or mutant forms of proteins from the iLBP family. As discussed above, this family includes FABPs (\nBanaszak et al (1994) Adv. Protein Chem. 45:89-151\n; \nBernlohr et al (1997) Ann. Rev. Nutrition, 17: 277-303\n). FABPs are intracellular proteins of approximately 15 kDa molecular weight and have a binding site that binds 1 or 2 FFA. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to determine the concentrations of different FFAu in mixtures of FFAu. Similarly, there are no general methods for determining the unbound concentrations of other important metabolites such as, for example other lipids, hormones, and drugs. This is largely due to the low concentration at which these components are present and their often poor solubility properties in aqueous solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnfortunately, despite the availability of protein structures and co-complex structures with ligands of interest, existing state of the art of molecular theory is not sufficient to design probes with the desired specificity and sensitivity de novo. Thus, extensive experimentation is typically required to find protein probes that not only bind with the desired specificity, but also produce a measurable signal indicative of ligand binding. Improving specificity and signaling through a completely random mutational strategy is not practical even for a small protein such as an FABP because a) there are 20\n131\n possible mutants for a 131 residue FABP, and b) testing even a single probe using established state of the art methods requires extensive time (at least 2 weeks/probe) for purification, reaction chemistry and probe fluorescence response characterization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEven if a more modest library of mutants is generated through random mutagenesis in specific regions of the protein, a method is needed to rapidly generate and screen the thousands of resulting mutant probes. Each mutant needs to be produced, and chemically reacted with a fluorescent group, in sufficient quantity to enable the measurement of its sensitivity and selectivity for many different ligands. It is also critical that the probes be as free as possible of contaminating proteins, unreacted fluorophore, and any other compounds that might interfere with sensitive fluorescence measurements. The development of a rapid, automated method for measuring and comparing probe responses to ligand is also critical. Embodiments of the invention described here satisfy these needs by disclosing \"high throughput\" methods for the rapid a) generation of large numbers of probes and the b) screening and characterization of these probes. An important aspect of this invention is that it allows the previous necessary and very time consuming step of characterization of ligand binding to the protein to be omitted; only the probe itself is characterized. This is important not only for the avoidance of the protein characterization step but also because the properties of the probe are often not predictable from the ligand-protein binding characteristics. For example, different proteins can have very similar binding affinities but the fluorescence response of their derivative probes can be quite different.\n\n\n \n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nEmbodiments of the invention are directed to high throughput methods for generating and screening of probes.

Preferred embodiments of the present invention relate to the development of fluorescent molecules (\"probes\") that can be used to determine the concentration of unbound metabolites. More particularly, the invention relates to 1) high throughput methods to discover such probes, 2) the use of such probes for clinical medicine, drug development and basic science, 3) examples of the development of probes for the determination of the unbound concentration of specific free fatty acids, 4) the use of such probes to provide a profile of unbound metabolites for monitoring the states of health and disease for early diagnosis of human disease and for monitoring the effect of therapeutic intervention on the course of a condition or disease. Other uses include drug screening and monitoring the effect of a nutrient. It is noteworthy that for each probe described, there is cross reactivity between the various categories of metabolites. For example, a probe may bind strongly to retinoic acid but, still have some binding affinity for fatty acids. The probes according to embodiments of the invention find utility in identification and quantification of a wide range of metabolites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProbes are proteins that have been 'labeled' through the covalent addition of a fluorescent molecule (fluorophore) to a specific site on the protein and that bind metabolites. Probes have the characteristic that their fluorescence changes in a measurable way when they bind metabolites. Different probes can be generated by mutating the starting (template) protein and labeling the mutated proteins (muteins) with a fluorophore. The ability of each such probe to respond to a particular metabolite (or analyte) can then be assessed by measuring the change in fluorescence upon addition of defined concentrations of the unbound metabolite.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerating the library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA library of proteins representing potential probes may be created by any means known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, a protein that is capable of binding one or more unbound metabolites may be used as a template for mutagenesis. In some preferred embodiments, the protein capable of binding one or more unbound metabolites includes serum albumins, acyl CoA binding proteins, phospholipid or glycolipid binding proteins, retinol/retinoic acid binding proteins, bile salt binding proteins, an antibody or a Fatty Acid Binding Protein (FABP). The protein may bind fatty acids, other metabolites or both fatty acids and other metabolites. Besides free fatty acids, possible metabolites include but are not limited to molecules such as drugs, drug metabolites, hormones, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, sphingosine, sphingolipids, phospholipids, glycolipids, cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives and other steroids, lipid-soluble vitamins, bile salts, enzyme cofactors, retinoids such as retinoic acid and retinal, heme and heme metabolites, amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates and multivalent ions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn more preferred embodiments, an FABP gene, wild-type or mutant, is used as the initial template or starting point for mutagenesis. A collection of mutant FABP clones is generated from the template. In preferred embodiments, mutation involves one or more amino acid substitutions in the binding cavity or the helical cap of the FABP. In a preferred embodiment, a mutant Rat Intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein (rI-FABP), which has 131 amino acid residues, was used as the starting point for the mutagenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn more preferred embodiments, sites that alter ligand binding are predominantly ones that are within the binding cavity or on the alpha helices that form the protein \"cap\" of the FABP. Sites that do not alter ligand binding are predominantly ones that are on the surface of the protein. In some embodiments, a library may be constructed by choosing among the sites that alter ligand binding and then applying random mutagenesis to those sites. Some single site mutants in the stated \"cavity\" or \"cap\" may not produce soluble protein or may fail to significantly affect binding. However, the same mutant, when combined with other mutations, may cause significant and favorable changes in ligand binding specificity. Such sites can also be selected experimentally as candidates for multi-site mutagenesis or library construction\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny number of mutagenesis methods may be used to generate a collection or \"library\" of mutants, said mutagenesis methods include but are not limited to error-prone PCR, site-directed mutagenesis using defined or degenerate oligonucleotides, splicing by overlap extension (SOE), gene shuffling, or the use of mutator host strains. In preferred embodiments, an oligo-directed method of PCR-based mutagenesis was used to generate a collection or \"library\" of mutants. However, as far as the screening is concerned, it doesn't matter whether the library is composed of known, specific site-directed mutants or an \"unknown\" random assortment of mutants. Both types of libraries are screened with the same efficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, oligos specifying desired mutations prime an enzymatic copying of the vector containing the template gene. The oligo, and therefore the desired mutation(s), is incorporated into the new copy of the gene. The sites mutated in the multi-site mutagenesis libraries of the preferred embodiments are those that were found to alter ligand-binding properties in a library of single point mutants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutant genes are introduced into an organism capable of producing soluble protein from the mutant gene. Any type of organism can be used as long as soluble protein can be harvested from the lysed cells or the cell growth medium. For example, bacteria are used for protein expression in the preferred embodiment, but one skilled in the art could also express the protein in yeast, insect or other eukaryotic cells.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nProducing the probes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein purification is accomplished by incubating lysate from each clone with a solid support to which the protein is specifically bound with high affinity. There are two ways to make the protein associate with a solid support: a) the protein can be changed to increase its affinity for a solid support or b) the support can be modified to increase its affinity for the protein. The latter can be accomplished, for example, by immobilizing antibodies on the solid support, said antibodies having a high binding-affinity for the protein of interest.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively the protein may be \"tagged\" so that it binds to the column material with high affinity. This includes but is not limited to tagging with biotin, Flag-epitope or c-myc epitope or HA-tag, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), maltose binding protein (MBP), a chitin binding domain (CBD), Thioredoxin, β-Galactosidase, VSV-Glycoprotein, calmodulin binding protein, or a metal affinity tag such as a 6X His tag. Preferably, the fusion partner does not change the FABP fatty acid binding properties. The specific association of the affinity tag with the solid support material enables single step purification of the protein of interest from the lysate, which contains thousands of other contaminating proteins and other substances. The affinity tag(s) may be fused at either the NH2- or COOH- termini or at both termini simultaneously. In a preferred embodiment, a 6X Histidine tag was fused to either the FABP NH\n2\n- or COOH- termini or at both termini simultaneously without significantly changing the protein's fatty acid binding properties. These fusion proteins can be reversibly immobilized on a solid support for protein purification, delipidation and probe production.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBefore now, muteins with potentially interesting binding properties were purified with the protein in the mobile, aqueous phase. Protein purification and delipidation required passing the mutein through various types of standard' purification matrices (i.e. size exclusion chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC)). The resulting purified and delipidated protein then underwent a buffer exchange process to place it in the fluorophore reaction buffer. After the labeling reaction, the labeled protein was subjected to several HIC chromatography steps to remove unreacted fluorophore. The probe production process, with its intrinsic protein handling losses, and the subsequent assay procedure required the production of milligram quantities (>5 mg) of each mutein. Protein production typically required at least one week per mutein per person and the labeling process required an additional week. Because synthesis of the labeled probe required a significant additional investment of time and money, muteins were only reacted with fluorophore if the binding properties of the unlabeled protein looked promising.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the new process described here, the muteins are affinity purified and left on the affinity purification matrix, essentially making the protein part of the solid phase. Chemical functionalities required for delipidation, labeling, and removal of unreacted label are passed over the protein/solid phase. This is the opposite of the current state of the art process. This new approach enables one person, with minimal automation, to produce approximately 800 labeled muteins in approximately 6 hours. Since we are assaying the probe directly, rather than an unlabeled protein indirectly, the signal is much stronger and very small quantities of probe are required (< 8 µg).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy this method a large number of muteins may be constructed, purified, fluorescently labeled and the probes screened for ligand binding in a high throughput format. In a preferred embodiment, the cell growth, cell lysis, protein purification, fluorescent labeling, and probe purification is done in multiwell plates. Preferably, the plates have from 1 to 1536 wells and each well has a volume of between 0.002 ml to 10 ml. By this method, probes may be generated which have different fluorescent responses to different fatty acids or other metabolites as compared to the response of the template. For example, the probe variants may each have different fluorescence spectra and/or different fluorescence intensity at a given emission wavelength when bound to a particular fatty acid as compared to the parent template.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, the protein variants are labeled with acrylodan while still bound to the solid support. However other fluorescent labels may also be used such as but not limited to danzyl aziridine, 4-[N-[(2-iodoacetoxy)ethyl]-N-methylamino]-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole ester (IANBDE), and 4-[N-[(2-iodoacetoxy)ethyl]-N-methylamino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (IANBDA). Other protein probes that bind unbound metabolites such as unbound FFA and that change their fluorescence upon binding may also be used including, but not limited to, albumin. Albumin with a fluorescent label such as 7-hydroxycoumarin or anthraniloyl changes its fluorescence upon binding FFA (\nDemant, E, Anal. Biochem. (1999) 267:366-372\n, \nMassey, J.B., et al Biophys. J. (1996) 72:1732-1743\n). Any fluorescent label may be used in the practice of the invention as long as a measurable difference may be detected upon binding of a free fatty acid or other analytes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the template FABP is recombinant rat intestinal fatty acid binding protein (rI-FABP). Derivatization with acrylodan is performed using known methods substantially as previously described (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,470,714\n \n & \nRichieri, G.V, et al., J. Biol. Chem.; (1992) 276: 23495-23501\n), and the resulting probe (ADIFAB) is commercially available (FFA Sciences LLC, San Diego, CA). A different fluorescence is exhibited by ADIFAB when FFA is bound and the concentration of FFAu can be determined from the change in fluorescence. The wavelength emitted by the fluorescently-labeled FABP depends upon the label and protein used. In an alternate preferred embodiment, the template protein is rI-FABP that has Ala substituted for Leu at position 72 (rI-FABP-L72A) with the resulting probe named ADIFAB2. The binding affinities of ADIFAB2 have been found to be about 10-fold greater than ADIFAB. ADIFAB2 also has an altered spectral response, making it especially useful for measurements of FFAu in blood samples (\nApple et al, Clinical Proteomics, (2004) 1:41-44\n, \n \nUS Patent Appl 10/670,958\n \n). The wavelengths at the maximum intensities emitted by these fluorescently-labeled I-FABP's in the absence of FFA is about 420 to 480 nm. The emission wavelengths at the maximum intensities emitted by these fluorescently-labeled I-FABP's with FFA bound is about 495 to 580 nm. Experiments typically involve measuring the fluorescence response within both emission maxima or at wavelengths for which the effect of interfering molecules such as hemoglobin can be eliminated as described in (\n \nUS application 10/670958\n \n and \n \nPCT/US2004/030521\n \n) and the calculation of the ratio 'R' of the two fluorescence intensities. The baseline value for this ratio, measured in the absence of analyte, is designated R0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProbes produced according to some embodiments of the invention have altered specificity for different FFAu or different unbound metabolites relative to the ADIFAB and ADIFAB2 probes made from the preferred templates-. Altered specificity refers to an alteration in the fluorescence change that occurs when the probe is exposed to different unbound metabolites or different molecular species of FFAu (for example different chain lengths and/or different numbers of double bond and/or different rotational isomers about a given double bond and/or different locations of double bonds.) For example, ADIFAB2 might reveal, when exposed to a particular FFAu1 at a concentration of [FFAu1], a change (ΔR1) in the value of the ratio R relative to R0. Exposing ADIFAB2 to n such FFAu would reveal a set of responses, {ΔRi} = ΔR1, ΔR2, ....ΔRn. A probe with altered specificities would possess a different set of responses to the same FFAu and concentrations; {ΔRi'} = ΔR1', ΔR2', ....ΔRn'. With sufficient numbers of different probes possessing different responses it would be possible by measuring the response of each probe to a sample containing mixtures of different FFAu and/or different unbound metabolites, to determine the concentration of each different FFAu and/or different unbound metabolites. Because different states of health and disease might alter the distribution of different FFAu and/or different unbound metabolites in a variety of body fluids including but not limited to whole blood, blood plasma, blood serum, urine, CSF, saliva, gastric juices, interstitial fluid, synoidal fluid or lymph, it can be expected that such a determination would provide valuable information about health status. In addition, such measurements would provide valuable tools for basic research and drug discovery.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreening the probes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, aliquots of the probes prepared as described above are placed in multi-well plates, suitable for fluorescence measurements. Defined amounts of ligands are added to each well and a fluorescence signal from the wells containing probe and ligand are compared to wells containing only the probe. The values obtained are compared with those of a 'reference' probe. The ligands may be fatty acids or other unbound metabolites. Preferably, the number of wells in the multiwell plate is between 1 and 1536. Preferably, at least some of the reagents are added to the plates using robotic liquid handling systems. Preferably, the fluorescence signal is measured from each well with a fluorescence plate reader to determine if the signals of each probe are significantly different than those of the parent probe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intensity ratio (\"R\" value) for a given probe is determined. The ratio is calculated using the following formula: \n \n \nR\n \n=\n \n \nF\n \n \nλ\n \n⁢\n \n1\n \n \n \n/\n \n \nF\n \n \nλ\n \n⁢\n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \n wherein, F\nλ1\n is the measured fluorescence intensities (intensity of sample with probe present minus intensity of sample without probe present) at \nwavelength\n 1 and F\nλ2\n is the measured fluorescence intensities (intensity of sample with probe present minus intensity of sample without probe present) at \nwavelength\n 2. Then, for a given probe, ΔR, the difference in R value between the measurement in the presence of the analyte and in the absence of the analyte, is calculated as follows: \n \n \nΔR\n \n=\n \n \nR\n \n \n+\n \nanalyte\n \n \n \n-\n \n \n \nR\n \n \n0\n \n \n \n \n The ΔR value for a given probe is then compared to a reference probe, for example, ADIFAB or ADIFAB2, by ΔR/ΔR\nreference\n. This value is an indication of how dissimilar the new probe (derived by mutation of the template) is to the reference. By this method, probes with new and useful characteristics may be identified. Measurements of fluorescence intensities are obtained using standard techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the fluorescence intensities at two or more wavelengths are measured in each well and the intensity ratios at all combinations of the two or more wavelengths are evaluated to determine if the ratios of each probe are significantly different than those of the reference probe. By this method, probes may be identified that have different specificities in their fluorescence response to different ligands as compared to the reference probe. In preferred embodiments, the ligands are unbound free fatty acids. Other methods for comparing changes in fluorescence with and without analyte can also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the invention, the probes are screened for their ability to be transported into a cell. The cell may be procaryotic or eukarotic. Preferably, the cell is a mammalian cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell transport may be facilitated by the use of a transport agent, such as a cationic lipid or cationic polymer or peptides. Such cationic lipid transport agents are well known and include, for example, Lipofectamine 2000® (Invitrogen) and peptides include Chariot\n™\n (Active Motif®).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments, the transport agent is mixed with the probe and the complex is incubated with cells which have been cultured on a suitable media. After incubation for a suitable period of time, the cells are washed and the ability of the probe to be transported into the cell may be determined by observation under a fluorescence microscope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the surface charge of the probe may be altered relative to the template protein to improve the transfection efficiency.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the probes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA collection of probes with distinct signaling properties can be used to determine the concentrations of different unbound metabolites in a mixture, for example the concentrations of different unbound free fatty acids in a mixture. Thus, an unbound metabolite and/or an unbound free fatty acid profile can be determined for an individual. The most complete profile for fatty acids is the enumeration of the concentrations of each of the unbound free fatty acids in a mixture. This type of profile will require at least n different probes for n fatty acids. Less detailed, but very informative profiles, such as the enumeration of the fractions of different fatty acid classes, can be determined with fewer distinct probes (n probes for n classes). Classes of unbound free fatty acids include saturated, unsaturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, short chain, medium chain, long chain and very long chain. In a preferred embodiment, the concentration of each type of unbound FFA in a mixture is determined. In another preferred embodiment, the fraction of unbound FFA that are unsaturated is determined. In another preferred embodiment, the fraction of FFAu that are monounsaturated is determined. In another preferred embodiment, the fraction of FFAu that are polyunsaturated is determined. In another preferred embodiment, the fraction of FFAu that are saturated is determined. In another preferred embodiment, the fraction of FFAu that are short chain (4-8 Carbon length) is determined. In another preferred embodiment, the fraction of FFAu that are medium chain (10-14 Carbon length) is determined. In another preferred embodiment, the fraction of FFAu that are long chain (16+ Carbon length) is determined. In another preferred embodiment, the fraction of FFAu that are very long chain (20+ Carbon length) is determined. Such determinations are used to generate, for any individual, a profile of unbound FFA that is useful in the diagnosis of disease and the determination of risk factors for disease. Such diseases include but are not limited to cardiac disease, stroke, neurological diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, inflammatory diseases and certain cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDNA and protein sequences for Fatty Acid Binding Proteins (FABPs) are shown in the sequence listing. SEQ ID NO: 1 shows the cDNA sequence for the wild-type rat intestinal Fatty Acid Binding Protein (rIFABP). The rat fatty acid binding protein is post-translationally modified in the rat, with the modifications including the removal of the N-terminal methionine and the acetylation of the \"new\" N-terminal residue Ala. Protein sequences are numbered starting with the first residue of the mature protein. Thus, Ala is \nresidue\n 1 in the corresponding protein shown as SEQ ID NO: 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO: 3 shows a preferred template rI-FABP-L72A DNA sequence according to the invention. SEQ ID NO: 4 shows the corresponding protein sequence. In this preferred embodiment, the protein has a substitution of alanine at position 72. Other preferred species which are derived from the protein shown as SEQ ID NO: 4 the probes listed in Tables 3,4,5,6,7 and 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn preferred embodiments of the invention, the sample used for the determination of unbound FFA is a fluid sample derived from a human, an animal or a plant. Preferably, the fluid is whole blood, blood plasma, blood serum, urine, CSF, saliva, gastric juices, interstitial fluid or lymph. In some embodiments, unbound metabolites such as unbound FFA are extracted from tissue samples by means known in the art. In other embodiments determination of unbound metabolites such as unbound FFA is performed within the cytoplasm of a cell by microinjecting or otherwise transfecting the probe into the cell. Unbound metabolites include but are not limited to unbound FFA, drugs, drug metabolites, hormones, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, sphingosine, sphingolipids, phospholipids, glycolipids, cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives and other steroids, lipid-soluble vitamins bile salts, enzyme cofactors, retinoids such as retinoic acid and retinal, heme and heme metabolites, amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates and multivalent ions. As discussed above, classes of unbound free fatty acids include saturated, unsaturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, short chain, medium chain and long chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA normal range for a given unbound metabolite is determined from a healthy population and deviations from this normal range may indicate disease. For example, elevated levels of unbound FFA are indicative of cardiac disease. In some embodiments, a metabolic profile is determined for an individual using more than one probe to determine levels of more than one unbound metabolite. Metabolic profiles from a normal, healthy population will be determined. Deviations from a normal metabolic profile are indicative of disease, nutrient deficiency, exposure to toxins or carcinogens and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, probes produced as described above are used to determine the effect of a drug on a known metabolic profile. The metabolic profile is determined for a test population which may be a normal or non-normal population such as a diseased population. For example, a metabolic profile may be determined for a diseased test population. The diseased test population could then be treated with a drug for a predetermined period of time. The metabolic profile is then redetermined for the test population after drug treatment to observe the effect of the drug on the metabolic profile. In some cases, a change in the metabolic profile may be undesirable, for example, if testing a drug for toxicity and/or unwanted side effects. In other embodiments, a change in metabolic profile may indicate the effectiveness of the drug tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[0067] In some embodiments, a drug therapy in a diseased patient is monitored using one or more probes prepared according to the invention. For example, a body fluid may be withdrawn from the patient. Binding of an unbound metabolite indicative of a disease may be tested using at least one probe produced as described herein. An abnormal level of one or more unbound metabolites is an indicator of a disease state. For example, elevated free fatty acids are risk factors and indicators of cardiovascular disease; deficiencies in vitamins B6 and folic acid have also been associated with cardiovascular disease and cancer. Levels of the unbound form of these metabolites may be measured or monitored according to the invention using probes generated as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the metabolic profile may be used to determine the effect of specific nutrients on an individual. A metabolic profile may be used to indicate a nutrient deficiency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a metabolic profile may be used to classify individuals into different categories having different susceptibilities to different drugs and/or nutrients. In preferred embodiments, principal component analysis may be used to cluster unbound metabolite profiles into defined groups.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSpecific point mutations were made at thirty-five sites within the rI-FABP-L72A fatty acid binding pocket, with up to 19 different amino acid residues substituted for the native amino acid at each site. Each mutein contained one substitution. Sites that appeared to produce interesting modifications were used as the starting point for further mutagenesis studies (See Example 2). Mutagenesis was carried out as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rI-FABP-L72A open reading frame (ORF) was cloned into a modified pET-11d plasmid/vector (Novagen) at a site that resulted in the fusion of a 6-His affinity tag to the protein COOH-terminus. This template DNA was propagated in \nE\n. \ncoli\n strain XL10-Gold (Stratagene). Purification of the template followed standard protocols (Sambrook et al., 1989). The template genes used in other screening examples also encode COOH-terminal 6-His fusions. We have found that the affinity tag can be fused to the NH\n2\n-terminus, the COOH-terminus or both termini of the rI-FABP protein without significantly changing the FFA binding characteristics of the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutant proteins were generated using an oligonucleotide-directed method of PCR-based mutagenesis. Oligonucleotides (oligos) of our design were purchased from QIAGEN. Oligonucleotide primers incorporating the desired mutation(s) were designed with an average length of 33 bases, with 15 bases on each side of the codon for the amino acid to be mutated. The calculated melting temperatures for oligo-template dimers ranged from 60 to 75°C. Mutagenesis reactions for single point mutations utilized single oligos. Reactions to generate multiple possible substitutions at one or multiple sites utilized approximately equimolar amounts of multiple oligos.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutagenic oligos were phosphorylated at their 5' ends with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, NEB) to allow for ligation during the mutagenesis reaction. Phosphorylation was carried out in a 50 µL reaction mixture containing the following reagents:\n\n \n \n \n1. 300 pmol of oligonucleotide\n \n2. 1 mM ATP\n \n3. 1X T4 polynucleotide kinase reaction buffer (NEB)\n\n \ni. 70 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6)\n \nii. 10 mM MgCl\n2\n \n \niii. 5 mM dithiothreitol\n \n \n \n4. 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase.\n \n\nThe reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min. followed by 20 min. incubation at 65°C to deactivate the T4 polynucleotide kinase.\n    \n \n \n \nMutant, single-stranded, closed-circle copies of the template protein orf in the pET-11d vector were synthesized in 50 µL PCR reactions containing the following reagents:\n\n \n \n \n1. 100 ng of vector containing rIFABP template gene.\n \n2. 10 pmoles 5' of each phosphorylated mutagenic primer.\n \n3. 5 units of thermostable DNA polymerase.\n \n4. 20 units of thermostable ligase.\n \n5. 10 nmoles of each dNTP (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP).\n \n6. 0.5 X thermostable DNA polymerase buffer\n\n \na. 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0\n \nb. 5 mM KCl\n \nc. 5 mM (NH\n4\n)SO\n4\n \n \nd. 1 mM MgSO\n4\n \n \ne. 0.5% Triton X-100\n \nf. 50 µg/ml BSA\n \n \n \n7. 0.5 X thermostable ligase buffer\n\n \na. 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6\n \nb. 12.5 mM potassium acetate\n \nc. 5 mM magnesium acetate\n \nd. 5 mM DTT\n \ne. 0.5 mM NAD\n \nf. 0.05% Triton X-100.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe PCR reactions utilized the following thermal cycler program:\n\n \n \n \n1. 45°C for 15 minutes (to allow ligase to repair any nicks in DNA template).\n \n2. 95°C for 2 minutes (activate polymerase and denature template strands).\n \n3. The following sequence is repeated 30 times:\n\n \na. 95°C 30 seconds (denaturation)\n \nb. 55°C for 45 seconds (anneal mutagenic primers to DNA template)\n \nc. 68°C for 14 minutes (DNA synthesis and ligation)\n \nd. 45°C for 5 minutes (extended time for ligase to close any gaps).\n \n \n \n4. 72°C for 20 minutes (extend all newly synthesized DNA to full length)\n \n5. 45°C for 15minutes (allow ligase to close any gaps)\n \n\n\n \n \n \nUpon completion of PCR mutagenesis, the reaction mixture was treated with the restriction enzyme Dpnl in an attempt to destroy the methylated wild-type template DNA strands. The reaction mixture was subsequently used to transform \nE. coli\n strain XL10-Gold (Stratagene). For site-specific mutants, clones (colonies) were picked and the presence of the mutation was verified by sequencing or by PCR with oligos designed to hybridize effectively with only the wild-type sequence. For libraries of clones with randomized multiple mutations, all of the XL-10 Gold colonies resulting from transformation with the mutagenesis reaction were utilized. Plasmid DNA was isolated from individual clones (site-specific mutagenesis) or a mixture of clones (multi-mutant libraries) and transformed into the \nE. coli\n strain BL21-DE3 (Novagen). Synthesis of the mutant protein was induced in 3 ml Luria broth (LB) cultures of single colonies by adding isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.4 mM. These cultures were grown and harvested in 48 position 5ml rectangular well plates (Innovative Microplates). Induction periods ranged from 2 to 12 hours at 37°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the cell pellets stored in the plates at -80°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell pellets from induced cultures were lysed to release the protein. The 48-well plates were removed from - 80 °C storage and the cell pellets thawed by floating the plates in a room temperature water bath. A 400 µl aliquot of lysis buffer was added to each well to disperse and lyse the cells. Lysis buffer has the following composition:\n\n \n \n \n1. 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0\n \n2. 250 mM NaCl\n \n3. 5 mM MgSO\n4\n \n \n4. 5 mM KCl\n \n5. 0.5ml/ml lysozyme\n \n6. 10µg/ml Dnase I\n \n7. 10 µM essentially fatty acid free BSA (Sigma, A6003)\n \n\n\n \n \n \nPlates were then subjected to two cycles of freezing and thawing, with freezing occurring in liquid nitrogen and thawing in the room-temperature water bath. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and the supernatants transferred to 96 position 2.2 ml rectangular well plates (ABgene).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffinity purification and delipidation of the FABP muteins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nApproximately 120 µl of 25% (v/v) Ni-agarose (Sigma His-Select HC, P-6611) suspension was added to each well and the plates sealed with 96-position cap sealing mats (Abgene). Plates were incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes with end-over-end mixing. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatants removed by aspiration. The FABP muteins are selectively retained by the Ni-agarose, resulting in a single step purification of the desired proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach bed of Ni-agarose beads was washed once with Wash Buffer I, which has the following components:\n\n \n \n \n1. 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0\n \n2. 200 mM NaCl\n \n3. 15 uM essentially fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA)\n \n4. 10 mM imidazole.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe bovine serum albumin component of the buffer delipidates the FABPs. A failure to fully delipidate the muteins typically results in poor labeling efficiency with the fluorophore. The wash process involved adding 1.5 ml of Wash Buffer I to each bead bed, making sure the beads were well dispersed, sealing the plate with a cap mat, gently shaking the plate, pelleting the Ni-agarose by centrifugation, and removing the supernatant by aspiration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach bed of Ni-agarose beads was then washed three times with 1.5 ml aliquots of Bis-Tris-Propane (BTP) Buffer to remove any residual BSA and to place the protein in the proper buffer for the fluorophore labeling reaction. The BTP Buffer is preheated to 37°C because the subsequent reaction with fluorophore is carried out at 37°C. Bis-Tris-Propane Buffer has the following composition:\n\n \n \n \n1. 10 mM Bis-Tris-Propane, pH 9.3\n \n2. 100 mM NaCl.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nEach wash step with BTP Buffer has the same buffer addition, mixing, centrifugation and aspiration steps as described above for washing with Wash Buffer I. The protein was then ready for reaction with the fluorophore.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReaction of FABP muteins with the fluorophore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA 470 µl aliquot of pre-warmed Bis-Tris-Propane Buffer was added to each bead bed (∼ 30 µl). A 5 µl aliquot of 20 mM acrylodan stock (20 mM in dimethylformamide) was then added to each sample, the plate sealed with a cap mat, and the plate was shaken to rapidly mix the contents. Plates were gently mixed end-over-end in a 37°C incubator for 60 minutes. Post-incubation plates were centrifuged to pellet the agarose beads and the supernatants discarded through aspiration. Residual unreacted acrylodan was largely removed by washing each bead bed with a 1.5 ml aliquot of Wash Buffer II:\n\n \n \n \n1. 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0\n \n2. 200 mM NaCl\n \n3. 15 µM essentially fatty acid free BSA.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe BSA component of Wash Buffer II binds to acrylodan. Residual BSA and acrylodan were removed by washing each bead bed with three 1.5 ml aliquots of Wash Buffer III:\n\n \n \n \n1. 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0\n \n2. 200 mM NaCl\n \n\n\n \n \n \nLabeled mutein probes were released from the Ni-agarose beads by adding 300 µl of Elution Buffer to each bead bed and gently mixing end-over-end for 20 minutes at room temperature. Elution Buffer had the following composition:\n\n \n \n \n1. 0.85 x HEPES buffer\n \n2. 75 mM EDTA\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe probe concentration for each mutein supernatant in the plate was estimated with the Bradford protein assay (BioRad).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMutant probes were screened in 96-well plates by fluorescence response to five fatty acids: arachidonate, linolenate, linoleate, oleate, and palmitate. Each fatty acid was prepared as a complex with BSA by slow addition of 50 mM stocks of fatty acid sodium salts at pH 11 to 600 µM BSA in HEPES buffer. During the formation of complexes, 15 µL aliquots were periodically measured with the reference probe, ADIFAB2, to determine the ΔR value upon excitation at 375 nm and fluorescence emission at 550 and 457 nm using a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon) (\nRichieri et al, Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry (1999), 192:87-94\n & \nRichieri et al, J. Biol. Chem. (1996), 271:31068-31074\n). Complexes were prepared such that the final ΔR was approximately 0.4 which correspond to [FFAu] ranging from 100 to 1000 nM depending on FFA type. These complexes buffer or clamp the FFAu levels at fixed values and therefore ensure the accurate comparison of different probes with the same FFAu concentrations. In contrast, addition of FFAu alone (i.e. uncomplexed FFA) introduces considerable uncertainty in comparing different probes because the FFAu level will be affected by binding to the dispensing device, the walls of the multi-well plates and to the probe itself. Thus, the terms \"buffer\" and \"clamp\" as used in this particular context herein are taken to mean the ability of a carrier macromolecule to complex with an unbound metabolite so that the unbound metabolite is presented accurately for measurement purposes and is prevented from non-specific binding such as binding to laboratory apparatus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlates were prepared and read in two stages. First, complexes and fatty acid free BSA were diluted to 6 µM BSA in HEPES and added to the 96-well plate at 300 µL per well. A MultiProbe II HT (Perkin Elmer) (an automated liquid handling system) was used to facilitate plate preparation for high throughput screening, but any automated or manual pipetting system will suffice. The background fluorescence was then measured at the same wavelengths as used for ADIFAB2 using a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer with an \nexternal Micromax\n 384 fluorescence plate reader (Jobin Yvon). In the second stage, 30 µL aliquots of the mutant probes were added to multiple wells of the plate, one for each fatty acid and one with fatty acid free BSA only, and the fluorescence intensity at each wavelength was again measured on the plate reader. After subtraction of the background fluorescence, the fluorescence ratio of each well was calculated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fluorescence response was quantitatively compared to ADIFAB2 to search for changes in magnitude and fatty acid profile; for example the response to one fatty acid relative to another. For each probe the ratio differences (ΔR) between wells with each fatty acid compared to a corresponding well with fatty acid free BSA were recorded. The relative response compared to ADIFAB2 was calculated by dividing ΔR for each fatty acid by that for ADIFAB2 (ΔR/ΔRAD2). Probes that show large (ΔR/ΔRAD2) and different (ΔR/ΔRAD2) for different fatty acids were chosen for larger scale production and calibration. The methods described above can be used to screen other fatty acids and / or other unbound metabolites using other plate readers. We have attained equivalent results, for example, using the Gemini EM dedicated fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices).\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFour amino acid positions Y14, L38, L72, and Y 117 of the L72A mutant of rI-FABP shown as SEQ ID NO: 4 were chosen for simultaneous, random mutagenesis. At each position, the native amino acid was potentially replaced with one of 8 other non-native amino acids. This meant that there were nine possible outcomes at each position:G, A, V, I, L, M, F, Y or W. The mutagenesis reaction for this library was carried out essentially as described in EXAMPLE 1. In this case, oligos for changing each of the four positions to the 8 different non-native amino acids (i.e. 32 oligos of equimolar amounts) were added to the mutagenesis reaction simultaneously. E. coli strain XL-10 Gold was transformed using the mutagenesis reaction and all of the resulting colonies pooled for the isolation of plasmid (Sambrook et al., 1989). The isolated plasmid mixture represented the DNA form of the library. An aliquot of library DNA was used to transform the E. coli expression strain BL21-(DE3). Mutant proteins were expressed, purified and labeled as described in Example 1. Over 3000 BL21(DE3) clones were picked and screened from this library. Similarly, a second library containing G, A, V, I, L, M, F, Y and W amino acid substitutions at positions M18, G31, F55, A73 of the L72A mutant of rI-FABP were constructed and approximately 3000 mutant clones screened.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScreening was conducted by evaluating ΔR/ΔRreference as described in paragraphs 0053-0055 and Example 1 for the following fatty acids: palmitate, palmitoleate, stearate, oleate, linoleate, linolenate and arachidonate, where the reference was to ADIFAB2. The screening rate was increased by use of 384 well plates. In this case the total well volume was reduced to 100 µL and the volume of probe used per well was 10 µL. Because the identity of each mutant probe was unknown in this example, the probes of interest were organized according to phenotype. Typically, phenotypic clusters could be generated by grouping unknown probes that gave Ro and ΔR/ΔRAD2 values within 10 to 20% of each other. Example phenotypes from the 3000 clones screened from the second library are shown in Table 1. The clone ID specifies the second library and well position of each clone. The fluorescence ratio for zero FFAu concentration (Ro) is shown in the second column. The remaining 7 columns are the ratios of the fluorescence response (R-Ro) for each probe relative to ADIFAB2 for arachidonate, linolenate, linoleate, oleate, palmitate, palmitoleate and stearate. The phenotypes of these probes reveal, relative to ADIFAB2, one with a large response to POA but smaller ones for OA and SA (L2P21H1), one with a response only for AA and SA (L2P12G9), one with greater response for all 7 FFA (L2P21C1), one with a distinct preference for PA (L2P14F12) and one with little or no response to any of the 7 FFA. It is apparent that such a table with thousands of mutein probe results can be searched for any desired phenotype using an appropriate method of query.\n\n \nTABLE 1\n \n \n \n \nExample clones from screening of second library\n \n \n \n \nCLONE ID\n \nRo\n \nAA\n \nLNA\n \nLA\n \nΔR/ΔR\nAD2\n OA\n \nPA\n \nPOA\n \nSA\n \n \n \n \nL2P21 H1\n \n0.30\n \n1.02\n \n1.80\n \n1.20\n \n0.55\n \n1.21\n \n2.49\n \n0.39\n \n \n \nL2P12 G9\n \n0.45\n \n0.54\n \n0.01\n \n-0.07\n \n0.07\n \n0.03\n \n-0.01\n \n0.48\n \n \n \nL2P21 C1\n \n0.39\n \n3.27\n \n3.73\n \n4.04\n \n3.20\n \n2.54\n \n3.52\n \n2.02\n \n \n \nL2P14 F12\n \n0.42\n \n0.47\n \n0.72\n \n0.54\n \n0.41\n \n1.09\n \n0.66\n \n0.29\n \n \n \nL2P3 C7\n \n0.10\n \n0.03\n \n0.04\n \n0.04\n \n0.02\n \n0.03\n \n0.05\n \n0.02\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nA strategy was also developed to improve upon \"hits\" from our primary screening. We have observed that some mutations, when present, create a bias towards distinct phenotypes of mutein probes. While one cannot expect the effects of independently assayed mutations to be simply additive when combined, the signaling or binding characteristics of some mutations are carried through when present in new mutant combinations. This makes it possible to arrive at the desired probe properties through iterations of screening, with the most desirable mutations observed in one library incorporated into the template for the next library. For example, a given library might produce several clones with a desired binding property such as low response to a given FFA or high dynamic range. Sequencing these 'interesting' clones enables one to identify whether a specific mutation is favoring the desired phenotype. If so, the mutation is incorporated into the template for the next round of mutagenesis and the new library is essentially a search for additional phenotypic improvements through synergy with substitutions at other amino acid positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor each probe considered to have a useful phenotype, the sequence is determined, milligram quantities of the probe are prepared and the probe is calibrated. Calibration of a new probe involves quantification of the fluorescence response to varying levels of fatty acids from zero to probe saturation. Spectra of probes were analyzed for true ratio behavior. Binding affinities (e.g. dissociation constant, Kd) and fluorescence parameters were quantified by measuring the fluorescence ratio upon straight titration with fatty acids and titration with fatty acid complexes with known unbound concentrations as determined with ADIFAB (see \nRichieri et al, Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry (1999), 192:87-94\n). Using calibration constants, the probe behavior was compared to the initial screen to check for desired properties.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTwo probes, ADIFAB2 (AD2) and L72V R106Q R126Q (VQQ), were used to determined the concentrations of arachidonic (AA) and palmitic (PA) acids in a prepared mixture of these fatty acids complexed with BSA. Probe VQQ has the unique property that it does not respond to palmitic acid. Four complexes were made as outlined in Example 1: (1) AA:BSA with 50 nM free AA, (2) AA:BSA with 200 nM free AA, (3) PA:BSA with 50 nM free PA, and (4) PA:BSA with 200 nM free PA. These complexes were mixed in ratios ranging from 1:1.5 to 10:1 PA:AA by volume and measured using ADIFAB2 and VQQ. Measurements were done using an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer (SLM-Aminco) in polystyrene cuvettes. Approximately 15 µL aliquots of each complex mixture was added to 1.5 mL of HEPES buffer, and about 0.5 µM of each probe was used. The ratio was measured for each probe and the total unbound FFA concentration and fractional concentrations of arachidonic and palmitic acids were determined using the following equations. \n \n \nFF\n \n⁢\n \n \nA\n \nAA\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \n \nm\n \n⁢\n \n1\n \n⁢\n \nAA\n \n \n \n-\n \n \nR\n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \nQ\n \n \n \n1\n \n⁢\n \nAA\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nKd\n \n \n \n1\n \n⁢\n \nAA\n \n \n \n \n \n \n=\n \n \nR\n \n1\n \n \n-\n \n \nR\n \n01\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFF\n \n⁢\n \n \nA\n \nAA\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \n \nm\n \n⁢\n \n2\n \n⁢\n \nAA\n \n \n \n-\n \n \nR\n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \nQ\n \n \n \n2\n \n⁢\n \nAA\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nKd\n \n \n \n2\n \n⁢\n \nAA\n \n \n \n \n \n \n+\n \nFF\n \n⁢\n \n \nA\n \nPA\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \n \nm\n \n⁢\n \n2\n \n⁢\n \nAA\n \n \n \n-\n \n \nR\n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \nQ\n \n \n \n2\n \n⁢\n \nAA\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nKd\n \n \n \n2\n \n⁢\n \nAA\n \n \n \n \n \n \n=\n \n \nR\n \n2\n \n \n-\n \n \nR\n \n02\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFF\n \n⁢\n \n \nA\n \nAA\n \n \n+\n \nFF\n \n⁢\n \n \nA\n \nPA\n \n \n=\n \nFF\n \n⁢\n \n \nA\n \nt\n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere the \n \nsubscripts\n \n 1 and 2 refer to probes VQQ and AD2, respectively, and the constants Q, Kd, and Rm were determined via probe calibration as discussed in example 2.

The fractional concentration of AA and PA are given by XAA=FFAAA/FFAt and XPA=FFAPA/FFAt. The results from these measurements are displayed in \nFigure 2\n. Complexes with [FFAu]=50 nM and 200 nM are shown. For both cases XAA increases linearly with an increase in the volume fraction of AA:BSA complex relative to the PA:BSA complex.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing multiple probes the concentrations of different fatty acid classes in a sample were determined. Specifically, blood plasma and serum samples were measured with three different probes with different fatty acid response profiles, each probe generating its own fluorescence ratio. The three probes were ADIFAB2, Y117A L72A, and D74F L72A (each of these represents a mutant protein labeled with acrylodan). The fluorescence ratio with and without sample was measured for each probe, and the relative concentration of saturated (Xs) and unsaturated (Xu) FFA as well as the total unbound FFA (FFAt) concentration in blood plasma and serum samples were determined by simultaneously solving a set of equations (linear in the fraction of each fatty acid class and total fatty acid concentration) based on the calibration of each probe for different fatty acids. For this analysis, saturated fatty acids include stearic and palmitic acids and unsaturated fatty acids include arachidonic, linolenic, linoleic, and oleic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe set of equations used to determine the FFA concentrations can be expressed in matrix form as shown below. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \n \nms\n \n⁢\n \n1\n \n \n \n-\n \n \nR\n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \nQ\n \n \ns\n \n⁢\n \n1\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \nK\n \n \nds\n \n⁢\n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \n \nmu\n \n⁢\n \n1\n \n \n \n-\n \n \nR\n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \nQ\n \n \nu\n \n⁢\n \n1\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \nK\n \n \ndu\n \n⁢\n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \n \nms\n \n⁢\n \n2\n \n \n \n-\n \n \nR\n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \nQ\n \n \ns\n \n⁢\n \n2\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \nK\n \n \nds\n \n⁢\n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \n \nmu\n \n⁢\n \n2\n \n \n \n-\n \n \nR\n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \nQ\n \n \nu\n \n⁢\n \n2\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \nK\n \n \ndu\n \n⁢\n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \n \nms\n \n⁢\n \n3\n \n \n \n-\n \n \nR\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \nQ\n \n \ns\n \n⁢\n \n3\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \nK\n \n \nds\n \n⁢\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \n \nmu\n \n⁢\n \n3\n \n \n \n-\n \n \nR\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \nQ\n \n \nu\n \n⁢\n \n3\n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \nK\n \n \ndu\n \n⁢\n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n \n \n1\n \n \n \n-\n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFFA\n \ns\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFFA\n \nu\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFFA\n \nt\n \n \n \n \n \n \n=\n \n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \n1\n \n \n-\n \n \nR\n \n01\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \n2\n \n \n-\n \n \nR\n \n02\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \n3\n \n \n-\n \n \nR\n \n03\n \n \n \n \n \n \n0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n where the \n \n \nsubscripts\n \n \n 1,2, and 3 refer to probes ADIFAB2, Y117A L72A, and D74F L72A, respectively, and the subscripts s,u, and t refer to the saturated, unsaturated, and total fatty acids. The values for the constants Rm, Kd, and Q were determined via probe calibration as discussed in example 2, and R\n0\n is the ratio in the absence of FFA. This matrix was solved to obtain FFAs, FFAu, and FFAt using a least squares method. The fraction of saturated and unsaturated FFA are given by Xs = FFAs/FFAt and Xu = FFAu/FFAt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeasurements of blood plasma from 12 healthy human donors were conducted with the three probes ADIFAB2, Y117A L72A, and D74F L72A. Measurements were made using a hand-held fluorometer designed for use with these probes (\n \nU.S. Patent Application 10/670,958\n \n which is incorporated herein by reference). Approximately 2 µL of plasma was added to 200 µL of HEPES buffer in a small glass cuvette, and about 1.5 µM of each probe was used, Results (Table 2) indicate that the FFAt (the total unbound concentration) for these individuals determined with the three probes is in excellent agreement with the values reported previously for healthy individuals using ADIFAB2 (\nApple et al (2004) Clinical Proteomics, 1:41-44\n). Furthermore the measured Xs values are consistent with values predicted from albumin binding affinities and the distribution of total FFA for healthy individuals (\nRichieri and Kleinfeld (1995) J. Lipid Res. 36: 229-240\n). One skilled in the art can extend this method to determine whether states of disease result in different distributions of unbound free fatty acids.\n\n \n \nTABLE 2\n \n \n \n \n \nHealthy Donors\n \n \n \n \n \nID\n \n \n \nXs\n \n \n \nFFAt (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \nN01\n \n0.18\n \n1.9\n \n \n \nN02\n \n0.16\n \n1.3\n \n \n \nN03\n \n0.22\n \n1.4\n \n \n \nN04\n \n0.31\n \n2.7\n \n \n \nN05\n \n0.24\n \n1.4\n \n \n \nN06\n \n0.13\n \n2.2\n \n \n \nN07\n \n0.36\n \n2.2\n \n \n \nN08\n \n0.22\n \n0.8\n \n \n \nN09\n \n0.23\n \n0.7\n \n \n \nN10\n \n0.20\n \n1.0\n \n \n \nN11\n \n0.16\n \n1.2\n \n \n \nN12\n \n0.20\n \n1.0\n \n \n \naverage\n \n0.22\n \n1.48\n \n \n \nstdev\n \n0.06\n \n0.63\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 5\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAdditional probes were produced according to the methods disclosed in Examples 1 and 2. Screening was performed according to Example 2. The results are shown in the attached Tables 3-7. As can be seen from the attached Tables 3-7, it is not necessary to have a mutation at position 72 in order to generate a useful probe. Useful probes are generated by a variety of single and multiple mutations. Generally a value of DR/DR > 0.1 indicates a potentially useful probe. Embodments of the invention are directed to probes with a value of DR/DR > 0.1, more preferably, > 0.2, yet more preferably, > 0.3, yet more preferably, > 0.4, yet more preferably, > 0.5, yet more preferably, > 0.6, yet more preferably, > 0.7, yet more preferably, > 0.8, yet more preferably, > 0.9, yet more preferably, > 1.0, yet more preferably, > 2.0, yet more preferably, > 3.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful probes are also generated by screening for probes in which the value of DR/DR is < 0.1. The clones for these \"non-responder\" probes may be used to generate non-responder libraries. These non-responder libraries are then screened for their ability to produce probes which bind to metabolites which are not fatty acids. An Example of this type of screen is shown below in Example 6.\n\n \n \nTABLE 3: List of responsive clones excluding L72A and WT IFABP\n \n \n \n \nClone\n \nAvgOfR o\n \nDR/DR AA\n \nDR/DR LNA\n

quantity of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB). Using 384-well plates, 335 mutant probes that were insensitive to FFA were screened for their response to UCB:BSA complexes at UCB:BSA ratios of 1:1, and 1:2 in aqueous buffer. All probes were prepared from rI-FABP-L72A with 1 to 5 mutations. Screening was conducted by comparing the fractional change in fluorescence intensity (ΔI/Io, where ΔI is the difference in probe intensity in the presence and absence of UCB and Io is the intensity in the absence of UCB) for the probes with that for ADIFAB2. This value was calculated for two emission wavelengths: 440 and 500 nm. Several probes were identified that had significantly improved responses to UCBu as compared to the template, ADIFAB2 (Table 8). The emitted fluorescence of these probes is quenched by binding of UCB.\n\n \n \nTABLE 8\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nΔI/Io\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPROBE ID\n \n \n \n1:2 UCB:BSA 440 nm 500 nm\n \n \n \n1:1 UCB:BSA 440 nm 500 nm\n \n \n \nKd (nM) at 22°C\n \n \n \nMutations\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nADIFAB2\n \n \n \n \n-0.19\n \n \n \n-0.16\n \n \n \n-0.40\n \n \n \n-0.34\n \n \n--\n \n--\n \n \n \n \nL1P1 B4\n \n \n-0.36\n \n-0.35\n \n-0.66\n \n-0.64\n \n590\n \n14I 72W 117W\n \n \n \n \nL1P1C12\n \n \n-0.86\n \n-0.79\n \n-0.92\n \n-0.86\n \n37\n \n381 72W 117W\n \n \n \n \nL1P12 E8\n \n \n-0.45\n \n-0.39\n \n-0.79\n \n-0.70\n \n112\n \n14L 38A 72G 117F 114E\n \n \n \n \nL1P14 D6\n \n \n-0.37\n \n-0.33\n \n-0.69\n \n-0.64\n \n230\n \n14M 72V 117W\n \n \n \n \nL1P5 H9\n \n \n-0.34\n \n-0.34\n \n-0.58\n \n-0.63\n \n490\n \n14M 721 117W\n \n \n \n \nL2P22 B1\n \n \n-0.36\n \n-0.35\n \n-0.70\n \n-0.68\n \n550\n \n18Y 31V 55V 72A\n \n \n \n \nL5P16 H4\n \n \n-0.37\n \n-0.31\n \n-0.69\n \n-0.64\n \n390\n \n126K 73F 72A\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nLarger preparations of select probes were prepared for quantitative determination of binding affinities. Binding isotherms were performed by measuring the fluorescence intensity for 1 µM of a given probe as the probe was titrated with known quantities of UCB. A binding isotherm for the probe L2P14F7 (mutations: 18G 31M 72A) is shown in \nFigure 3\n. A non-linear fit to the data gives a Kd of 150 nM. Table 3 lists the Kd values and mutations for some example probes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInitial screening of the UCB-probes indicated that the probes do not respond to FFA. This property was confirmed by titration of a mixture of 0.5 µM UCB and 1 µM L2P14F7 with sodium oleate. The probe shows no change in response even after 1 µM total oleate has been added to the solution (\nFigure 4\n). Oleic acid is the most abundant FFA in serum, and measurements of normal serum samples indicate that typical unbound concentrations of oleic acid are less than 1 nM. By using non-responsive probes from FFA screening to conduct a secondary screening with other unbound analytes, a UCB-sensitive probe that has a negligible response to the major FFA in blood has been generated from a rI-FABP-L72A mutant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe response of L2P14F7 to plasma samples from healthy adult donors, for which the UCBu concentration is expected to be about 1 nM or less, was measured (\nFigure 5\n). Samples were diluted to 1% by volume in pH 7.4 HEPES buffer. Little to no response was observed for these samples, indicating that no components within the plasma samples bind to L2P14F7 and alter its fluorescence. To demonstrate that the probe was still active, the samples were spiked with 5 µM UCB, and the probe fluorescence was measured again. A substantial decrease in the fluorescence was observed for both samples A and B, corresponding to UCBu concentrations of 110 and 70 nM (\nFigure 3\n). An albumin assay revealed that sample B had a significantly greater serum albumin concentration than sample A, which is consistent with the lower levels of UCBu detected in sample B. The results demonstrate that L2P14F7 is a UCB-specific probe with no appreciable affinity for other typical serum components and that this probe can be used to measure pathophysiologic levels of UCBu in plasma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood by those of skill in the art that numerous and various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Therefore, it should be clearly understood that the forms of the present invention are illustrative only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention."
