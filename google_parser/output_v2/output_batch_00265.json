Description\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a sulfonamide compound or a salt thereof, which is useful as an active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition, in particular, a pharmaceutical composition for treating a lower urinary tract symptom.\n\n\n \nBackground Art\n\n\n \n \n \nOveractive bladder that is one of the diseases which cause a lower urinary tract symptom refers to a clinical condition of the disease characterized by urinary urgency regardless of the presence or absence of incontinence, which is usually accompanied by pollakiuria and nocturia (\nNeurourology and Urodynamics, 21, 167-178 (2002\n)). For a treatment thereof, currently an anticholinergic agent is mainly used, and constant treatment results are obtained. However, it has been reported that the use thereof is difficult with patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or elderly patients since it is known to cause side-effects such as dry mouth, constipation and blurred vision, as well as carrying a risk of urinary retention. In addition, it is known that there exist patients showing no improvement with treatment with the anticholinergic agent. In view of the above-mentioned facts, there are great expectations for a drug with a new mechanism of action for the overactive bladder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProstaglandin E\n2\n (PGE\n2\n) is a bioactive substance for which arachidonic acid is used as a precursor, and is known to participate in regulation of the functions of the body through four subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors, i.e., EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4.\n\nIt is known that intravesical instillation of PGE\n2\n results in strong urinary urgency and reduction in the bladder capacity in human (\nUrological Research, 18(5), 349-352 (1990\n)), and that intravesical instillation of PGE\n2\n results in reduction in the bladder capacity of a rat (\nThe Journal of Urology, 153(6), 2034-2038 (1995\n)), and a possibility that PGE\n2\n affects the function of the lower urinary tract is suggested. In recent years, it has been reported that administration of an EP1 receptor antagonist to a model rat with a spinal cord injury is useful in improving the voiding function (\nJournal of The Japanese Urological Association, February 2001, Vol. 92, No. 2, p. 304\n), that the abnormal voiding function of a model mouse with urethral stricture is eliminated by the knock-out of an EP1 receptor, and that exacerbation of the abnormal voiding function is shown with intravesical instillation of PGE\n2\n (Patent Document 1). Consequently, it is believed that the EP1 receptor antagonist is useful as an agent for treating a lower urinary tract symptom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, with respect to the EP1 receptor antagonist, from the mechanism of action thereof, side effects specific to an anticholinergic agent are expected to be avoided, and in addition, an effect on patients who show no improvement by treatment with the anticholinergic agent can also be expected. Furthermore, this agent can be expected to further improve potent subjective symptoms by acting on sensory nerves. Furthermore, this agent has been reported to exhibit an effect of improving the clinical condition without lowering the voiding efficiency of a rat with spinal cord injury (General Assembly Proceedings of the 89th Japanese Urological Association (Kobe, 2001), pamphlet, MP-305), and thus it can be expected to be administered safely to patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or elderly patients.\n\nFurthermore, it is also widely known that PGE\n2\n is produced locally as an accompaniment to inflammation or tissue disorders, and is known to participate in expression of pain or fever as well as to enhance the inflammatory reaction. In recent years, it has become known that an EP1 receptor antagonist shows efficacy in model animals with various types of pain such as inflammatory pain (\nAnesthesiology, 97(5), 1254-1262 (2002\n)), postoperative pain (\nAnesthesia and Analgesia, 95(6), 1708-1712 (2002\n)), and neuropathic pain (\nAnesthesia and Analgesia, 93(4), 1012-1017 (2001\n)). In addition, there have been reports on the clinical effect of administration of an EP1 receptor antagonist on visceral pain caused by hydrochloric acid (\nGastroenterology, 124(1), 18-25 (2003\n)). From the above-mentioned facts, it is believed that the EP1 receptor antagonist is also useful as an agent for treating various types of pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMoreover, it is known that the EP1 receptor antagonist has an inhibitory action on aberrant crypt foci of the colonic mucosa, and on intestinal polyp formation (Patent Document 2), and it is believed that the EP1 receptor antagonist is also useful as an agent for treating colon cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a sulfonamide compound having an EP1 receptor antagonistic action, for example, compounds represented by the formulae (A), (B), (C), and (D) have been reported (Patent Documents 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively).\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n(In the formula above, R\n4\n represents (1) hydrogen, (2) C1 to 8 alkyl, C2 to 8 alkenyl, or C2 to 8 alkynyl, (3) C1 to 6 alkyl substituted with one or two groups selected from the group consisting of COOZ\n8\n, CONZ\n9\nZ\n10\n, OZ\n8\n group, and C1 to 4 alkoxy-C1 to 4 alkoxy, (4) C3 to 7 cycloalkyl, or (5) C1 to 4 alkyl, C2 to 4 alkenyl, or C2 to 4 alkynyl, each substituted with phenyl or C3 to 7 cycloalkyl, and Z\n4\n represents SO\n2\n or CO.

After culturing, the cells were collected, treated with a cell lysate (20 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) buffer pH 7.5, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid(EDTA)), and ultracentrifuged (23000 revolutions, 25 minutesx2) for rough preparation of a membrane sample.\n\nA reaction liquid containing the prepared membrane sample (15 µg) and \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n (150 µl, composition: 10 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES)/potassium hydroxide (KOH) pH 6.0, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM magnesium chloride (MgCl\n2\n), 0.02% 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propanesulfonate (CHAPS)) was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The reaction was stopped with an ice-cooled buffer, and suction-filtering was performed under reduced pressure to trap the bound \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n to a glass filter (product name: UNIFILTER-96, GF/B, PerkinElmer), so as to measure the radioactivity of the binding with a microplate scintillation counter (product name: TopCount, Packard) using Microscinti (product name: MICROSCINTI 20, PerkinElmer).\n\nThe dissociation constant (Kd) and the maximum binding amount (Bmax) were determined from Scatchard plotting (\"\nAnnals of the New York Academy of Science\" (US), 1949, Vol. 51, p. 660\n). Nonspecific bindings were determined as bindings in the presence of an excess amount (2.5 µM) of label-free PGE\n2\n. The assessment of the inhibitory action on \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n binding by the compound was carried out by adding 2.5 nM \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n and the compound.\n\nThe inhibition constant Ki (nM) for each compound was obtained using the following formula: \n \n \nKi\n \n=\n \n \nIC\n \n50\n \n \n/\n \n \n1\n \n+\n \n \n \nC\n \n \n/\n \nKd\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIn the formula, [C] represents the concentration of \n3\nH-PGE\n2\n employed in the reaction system.\n\nAs a result, for example, the compound of Example 71 showed a Ki value of 0.47 M.\n\n\n \nTest Example 3 Action on Rat with Acetic Acid-Induced Pollakiuria\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-pollakisuria action of the compound was assessed using a pathological model. It has been known that intravesical treatment with acetic acid in rat damages the bladder mucosa, thereby activating the afferent nerve transmitting nociceptive stimulus (\"\nThe Journal of Neuroscience\", (US), December 1992, Vol. 12, No. 12, p. 4878-89\n). Since the pollakiuria condition is induced by intravesical treatment with acetic acid, it is possible to assess the therapeutic effects of the compound against the symptoms.\n\nFor the experiment, male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories) having weights ranging from 200 to 450 g were used. The urinary bladder was exteriorized by midline abdominal incision under pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg, i.p.), and residual urine in the bladder was removed with a syringe equipped with a 27G needle. Thereafter, 0.5 to 0.7 mL of a 1% acetic acid solution was injected into the bladder and the wound was closed. Two days later, experimentation was carried out. Rats were placed in metabolic cages for acclimation for 1 hour, and then the test drug was orally administered. Immediately thereafter, change in the amount of urination was continuously measured for 6 hours. Total amount of urine was divided by total urination incidents to calculate the effective bladder capacity. As a result, it was noted that the effective bladder capacity of the group of which the bladders had been treated with acetic acid was decreased as compared to that of the sham-operated group, and thus showed pollakiuria condition. On the other hand, it was confirmed that there were compounds which improved the pollakiuria condition excellently at a minimum effective dose (MED) of 3 mg/kg among the compounds of the formula (I).\n\n\n \nTest Example 4 Test on Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 Enzyme Inhibition\n\n\n(Evaluation of Drug Interaction)\n\n\n(1) Inhibition Test I (Calculation of Inhibitory Activity I)\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing a 96-well plate, a substrate (midazolam), a test compound and human liver microsome (0.1 mg protein/ml) were incubated at 37°C for 20 minutes in a 100 mM phosphate buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM NADPH.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compositions comprising Factor VII and other blood clotting factors having altered patterns of asparagine-linked glycosylation.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe proteins involved in the clotting cascade, including, e.g., Factor VII, Factor VIII, Factor IX, Factor X, and Protein C, are proving to be useful therapeutic agents to treat a variety of pathological conditions. Accordingly, there is an increasing need for formulations comprising these proteins that are pharmaceutically acceptable and exhibit a uniform and predetermined clinical efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of the many disadvantages of using human plasma as a source of pharmaceutical products, it is preferred to produce these proteins in recombinant systems. The clotting proteins, however, are subject to a variety of co- and post-translational modifications, including, e.g., asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycosylation; O-linked glycosylation; and y-carboxylation of glu residues. These modifications may be qualitatively or quantitatively different when heterologous cells are used as hosts for large-scale production of the proteins. In particular, production in heterologous cells often results in a different array of glycoforms, which are identical polypeptides having different covalently linked oligosaccharide structures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn different systems, variations in the oligosaccharide structure of therapeutic proteins have been linked to, \ninter alia,\n changes in immunogenicity and \nin vivo\n clearance. Thus, there is a need in the art for compositions and methods that provide clotting protein preparations, particularly preparations comprising recombinant human Factor VII, modified Factor VII, or Factor VII-related polypeptides, that contain predetermined glycoform patterns.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to preparations comprising Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides that exhibit predetermined glycoform patterns. As used herein, a Factor VII or Factor VII-related preparation refers to a plurality of Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides, including variants and chemically modified forms, as well as forms that have been proteolytically activated (e.g., Factor VIIa), that have been separated from the cell in which they were synthesized. A glycoform pattern refers to the distribution within the preparation of oligosaccharide chains having varying structures that are covalently linked to Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides a preparation comprising a plurality of Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides, wherein the polypeptides comprise asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains and wherein one or more of the following applies: (i) between about 94-100% of the oligosaccharide chains comprise at least one sialic acid moiety; (ii) between about 0-7% of the oligosaccharide chains have a neutral-charge; (iii) less than about 16%, such as, e.g., between about 6-16% of the oligosaccharide chains comprise at least one terminal galactose residue; (iv) less than about 25%, such as, e.g., between about 6-9% of the oligosaccharide chains comprise at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; or (v) less than about 30%, such as, e.g., between about 11-23% of the oligosaccharide chains comprise at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue. In some embodiments, in addition to one or more of (i)-(v): all of the sialic acid residues in the oligosaccharide chains are linked to galactose via an α2->3 linkage; at least some of the sialic acid residues comprise N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) in addition to N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac); and/or the oligosaccharide chains comprise fucose residues linked α1->6 to a core N-acetylglucosamine. In one embodiment, the invention encompasses a preparation comprising wild-type Factor VIIa in which between about 94-100% of the oligosaccharide chains have at least one sialic acid residue and all of the sialic acid residues are linked to galactose via an α2->3 linkage. In another embodiment, the invention encompasses a preparation comprising wild-type Factor VIIa in which between about 94-100% of the oligosaccharide chains have at least one sialic acid residue and at least some of the sialic acid residues are N-glycolylneuraminic acid. In yet another embodiment, the invention encompasses a preparation comprising wild-type Factor VIIa in which between about 94-100% of the oligosaccharide chains have at least one sialic acid residue and at least some of the chains contain N-acetylgalactosamine. The preparations of the present invention thus do not encompass wild-type Factor VII or Factor VIIa that has been isolated from human plasma and has not been modified ex \nvivo\n by glycosidase treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a preparation comprising a plurality of Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides, wherein the polypeptides comprise asparagines-linked oligosaccharide chains and wherein at least about 2% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine residue (i.e., an N-acetylglucosamine residue that is linked β1->2,4, or 6 to a Man residue). Preferably, at least about 5% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one such antennary fucose residue; more preferably, at least about 10% or 20%; and most preferably, at least about 40%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparations according to invention may comprise one or more of unmodified wild-type Factor VII; wild-type Factor VII that has been subjected to chemical and/or enzymatic modification; and Factor VII variants having one or more alterations in amino acid sequence relative to wild-type Factor VII. The preparations of the invention may be derived from human cells expressing Factor VII from an endogenous Factor VII gene or from cells programmed to express Factor VII or a Factor VII-related from a recombinant gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides preparations comprising Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides that exhibit one or more improved functional properties, including, without limitation, increased storage stability, bioavailability, and/or half-life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention encompasses methods for determining and/or optimizing the glycoform pattern of Factor VII and Factor VII-related polypeptides, which are carried out by the steps of:\n\n \n \n \n(a) culturing a cell expressing Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides under a first set of predetermined culture conditions;\n \n(b) recovering Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides from the culture to obtain a preparation comprising the polypeptides; and\n \n(c) analyzing the structure of the oligosaccharides linked to the polypeptides to determine the glycoform pattern of the preparation.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe methods may further comprise altering the culture conditions of step (a) to achieve a second set of predetermined culture conditions; and repeating the steps until a desired glycoform pattern is achieved. Alternatively, the methods may further comprise treating the preparation chemically or enzymatically to alter the oligosaccharide structure; and repeating the steps until a desired glycoform pattern is achieved. Furthermore, the methods may comprise the additional steps of subjecting preparations having predetermined glycoform patterns to at least one test of bioactivity or other functionality (such as, e.g., pharmacokinetic profile or stability), and correlating particular glycoform patterns with particular bioactivity or functionality profiles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods for producing a preparation comprising Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides having a predetermined pattern of N-linked glycosylation. In some embodiments, the methods are carried out by culturing a cell expressing the polypeptides under conditions in which at least about 94% of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides linked to the Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides comprise at least one sialic acid residue, e.g., one, two, three, or four sialic acid residues. In some embodiments, the methods are carried out by culturing a cell expressing the polypeptides under conditions in which at least about 5% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine residue. In some embodiments, Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides, irrespective of their source, are subjected to enzymatic treatments to achieve the desired glycoform patterns.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising the preparations of the invention and methods of preventing and/or treating syndromes that are responsive to Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides. The methods comprise administering the pharmaceutical formulations to a patient in need of treatment, under conditions that result in either an enhancement or inhibition in blood clotting. In one series of embodiments, Factor VII preparations are administered when it is desired to enhance blood clotting, such as, e.g., in haemophilia A, haemophilia B, Factor XI deficiency, Factor VII deficiency, thrombocytopenia, or von Willebrand's disease; in syndromes accompanied by the presence of a clotting factor inhibitor; before, during, or after surgery or anticoagulant therapy; or after trauma. In another series of embodiments, preparations of Factor VII-related polypeptides (i.e., preparations having reduced or modified bioactivity relative to wild-type Factor VII) are administered to reduce blood clotting, such as, e.g., in patients undergoing angioplasty or those suffering from deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), fibrin deposition in lungs and kidneys associated with gram-negative endotoxemia, or myocardial infarction. According to the invention, preparations of Factor VII-related polypeptides may also be administered when it is desired to modify, such as, e.g., reduce, intracellular signalling via a tissue factor (TF)-mediated pathway, to treat conditions such as, e.g., Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), Multiple Organ Failure (MOF), and thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDetailed Description of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present inventors have discovered that preparations of coagulation proteins having predetermined glycoform patterns exhibit improved functional properties. Accordingly, the present invention relates to methods and compositions that provide these protein preparations. In particular, the invention relates to preparations comprising Factor VII polypeptides and Factor VII-related polypeptides having specific predetermined patterns of asparagine-linked (N-linked) oligosaccharides. The preparations of the invention exhibit altered properties, including, without limitation, improved pharmacokinetic properties and improved clinical efficacy. The invention also encompasses pharmaceutical formulations that comprise these preparations, as well as therapeutic methods that utilize the formulations.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFactor VII Polypeptides and Factor VII-Related Polypeptides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses human Factor VII polypeptides, such as, e.g., those having the amino acid sequence disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,784,950\n \n (wild-type Factor VII). As used herein, \"Factor VII\" or \"Factor VII polypeptide\" encompasses wild-type Factor VII, as well as variants of Factor VII exhibiting substantially the same or improved biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VII. The term \"Factor VII\" is intended to encompass Factor VII polypeptides in their uncleaved (zymogen) form, as well as those that have been proteolytically processed to yield their respective bioactive forms, which may be designated Factor VIIa. Typically, Factor VII is cleaved between residues 152 and 153 to yield Factor VIIa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"Factor VII-related polypeptides\" encompasses polypeptides, including variants, in which the Factor VIIa biological activity has been substantially modified or reduced relative to the activity of wild-type Factor VIIa. These polypeptides include, without limitation, Factor VII or Factor VIIa that has been chemically modified and Factor VII variants into which specific amino acid sequence alterations have been introduced that modify or disrupt the bioactivity of the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biological activity of Factor VIIa in blood clotting derives from its ability to (i) bind to tissue factor (TF) and (ii) catalyze the proteolytic cleavage of Factor IX or Factor X to produce activated Factor IX or X (Factor IXa or Xa, respectively). For purposes of the invention, Factor VIIa biological activity may be quantified by measuring the ability of a preparation to promote blood clotting using Factor VII-deficient plasma and thromboplastin, as described, e.g., in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,997,864\n \n. In this assay, biological activity is expressed as the reduction in clotting time relative to a control sample and is converted to \"Factor VII units\" by comparison with a pooled human serum standard containing 1 unit/ml Factor VII activity. Alternatively, Factor VIIa biological activity may be quantified by (i) measuring the ability of Factor VIIa to produce of Factor Xa in a system comprising TF embedded in a lipid membrane and Factor X. (\nPersson et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272:19919-19924, 1997\n); (ii) measuring Factor X hydrolysis in an aqueous system (see, Example 5 below); (iii) measuring its physical binding to TF using an instrument based on surface plasmon resonance (\nPersson, FEBS Letts. 413:359-363, 1997\n) (iv) measuring hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate (see, Example 4 below); and (v) measuring generation of thrombin in a TF-independent in vitro system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor VII variants having substantially the same or improved biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VIIa encompass those that exhibit at least about 25%, preferably at least about 50%, more preferably at least about 75% and most preferably at least about 90% of the specific activity of wild-type Factor VIIa that has been produced in the same cell type, when tested in one or more of a clotting assay, proteolysis assay, or TF binding assay as described above. Factor VII variants having substantially reduced biological activity relative to wild-type Factor Vlla are those that exhibit less than about 25%, preferably less than about 10%, more preferably less than about 5% and most preferably less than about 1% of the specific activity of wild-type Factor Vlla that has been produced in the same cell type when tested in one or more of a clotting assay, proteolysis assay, or TF binding assay as described above. Factor VII variants having a substantially modified biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VII include, without limitation, Factor VII variants that exhibit TF-independent Factor X proteolytic activity and those that bind TF but do not cleave Factor X.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVariants of Factor VII, whether exhibiting substantially the same or better bioactivity than wild-type Factor VII, or, alternatively, exhibiting substantially modified or reduced bioactivity relative to wild-type Factor VII, include, without limitation, polypeptides having an amino acid sequence that differs from the sequence of wild-type Factor VII by insertion, deletion, or substitution of one or more amino acids. Non-limiting examples of Factor VII variants having substantially the same biological activity as wild-type Factor VII include S52A-FVlla, S60A-FVlla (\nlino et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 352: 182-192, 1998\n); FVlla variants exhibiting increased proteolytic stability as disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,580,560\n \n; Factor Vlla that has been proteolytically cleaved between residues 290 and 291 or between residues 315 and 316 (\nMollerup et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 48:501-505, 1995\n); and oxidized forms of Factor Vlla (\nKornfelt et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 363:43-54, 1999\n). Non-limiting examples of Factor Vll variants having substantially reduced or modified biological activity relative to wild-type Factor Vll include R152E-FVlla (\nWildgoose et al., Biochem 29:3413-3420, 1990\n), S344A-FVlla (\nKazama et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:66-72, 1995\n), FFR-FVlla (\nHolst et al., Eur. J. Vasc. Endovasc. Surg. 15:515-520, 1998\n), and Factor VIIa lacking the Gla domain, (\nNicolaisen et al., FEBS Letts. 317:245-249, 1993\n). Non-limiting examples of chemically modified Factor VII polypeptides and sequence variants are described, e.g., in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,997,864\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAsparagine-Linked Glycosylation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides preparations of Factor Vll polypeptides or Factor Vll-related polypeptides that comprise a particular spectrum of Factor VII glycoforms, i.e., Factor Vll polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides having predetermined patterns of asparagine-linked (N-linked) oligosaccharide chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a \"pattern\" of N-linked glycosylation or a glycoform \"pattern\", \"distribution\", or \"spectrum\" refers to the representation of particular oligosaccharide structures within a given population of Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides. Non-limiting examples of such patterns include the relative proportion of oligosaccharide chains that (i) have at least one sialic acid residue; (ii) lack any sialic acid residues (i.e., are neutral in charge); (iii) have at least one terminal galactose residue; (iv) have at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; (v) have at least one \"uncapped\" antenna, i.e., have at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue; or (vi) have at least one fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an oligosaccharide chain refers to the entire oligosaccharide structure that is covalently linked to a single asparagine residue. Factor VII is normally glycosylated at Asn 145 and Asn 322. An N-linked oligosaccharide chain present on Factor Vll produced in a human \nin situ\n may be bi-, tri, or tetraantennary, with each antenna having the structure Neu5Ac(α2->3 or α2->Gal(β1->4) GIcNAc linked (β1->2,4, or 6) to a Man residue which is linked (α1->3 or 6) to Man(β1->4)GlcNAc-Asn. (Neu5Ac signifies N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid), Gal signifies galactose, GlcNAc signifies N-acetylglucosamine, and Man signifies mannose). The oligosaccharide chains may also comprise fucose residues, which may be linked α 1->6 to GlcNAc. When Factor VII is produced in a human \nin situ,\n some of the oligosaccharide chains lack core fucose residues; all of the chains lack antennary fucose residues; and all of the chains are almost completely sialylated, i.e., the terminal sugar of each antenna is N-acetylneuraminic acid linked to galactose via an α2->3 or α2->6 linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen produced in other circumstances, however, Factor VII may contain oligosaccharide chains having different terminal structures on one or more of their antennae, such as, e.g., lacking sialic acid residues; containing N-glycolyineuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) residues; containing a terminal N-acetylgalactosamine (GaINAc) residue in place of galactose; and the like. When produced in, e.g., BHK cells cultured in the presence of calf serum, Factor VII preparations exhibit the following oligosaccharide patterns:\n\n \n \n \n-87-93% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least a single sialic acid residue;\n \n-7-13% are neutral (lack any sialic acid);\n \n-9-16% contain at least one terminal galactose residue;\n \n-19-29% contain at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; and\n \n-30-39% contain at least one uncapped antenna, i.e., contain at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe present inventors have produced Factor VII preparations containing specific predetermined oligosaccharide patterns that differ from those previously described. The present invention encompasses preparations comprising Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides exhibiting one or more of the following glycoform patterns:\n\n \n \n \n(i) Between about 94-100% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue, such as, e.g., between about 94-99%, between about 95-98%, or between about 96-97%. In different embodiments, at least about 94%, 95%, 96%, or 97% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue.\n \n(ii) 6% or less of the oligosaccharide chains are neutral, such as, e.g., between about 1.5-6% or between about 2-4%.\n \n(iii) Less than about 16%, preferably, less than about 10% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one terminal galactose, such as, e.g., between about 6-10% or between about 8-9%;\n \n(iv) Less than about 25%, preferably, less than about 10% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one terminal GalNAc residue, such as, e.g., between about 6-9% or between about 7-8%;\n \n(v) Less than about 30, preferably, less than about 25% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one uncapped antenna, such as, e.g., between about 11-23% or between about 12-18%; and\n \n(vi) At least about 2%, preferably, at least about 5%, more preferably, at least about 10% or 20%; and most preferably, at least about 40%, of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine residue (i.e., an N-acetylglucosamine residue that is linked β1->2,4, or 6 to a Man residue).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIt will be understood that each of (i)-(vi) may represent a distinct glycoform pattern that is encompassed by the present invention, i.e., a preparation according to the invention may be described by only one of (i)-(vi). Alternatively, depending on the particular glycoform pattern, a preparation encompassed by the invention may be described by more than one of (i)-(vi).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, a preparation encompassed by the invention may be described by one or more of (i)-(vi) in combination with one or more other structural features. For example, the invention encompasses preparations comprising Factor VII polypeptides or Factor Vll-related polypeptides in which the sialic acid residues (Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc) are linked to galactose exclusively in an α2->3 configuration. The invention also encompasses preparations comprising Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides that contain fucose linked α 6 to a core N-acetylglucosamine and/or fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine. In one series of embodiments, the preparations of the invention encompass Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides in which more than 99% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue and (a) the sialic acid residues are linked exclusively in an α2->3 configuration and/or (b) there are fucose residues linked to core N-acetylglucosamines and/or (c) a detectable number of antenna terminate in N-acetylgalactosamine. In one embodiment, the invention encompasses preparations comprising wild-type Factor VIIa in which more than 99% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue and the sialic acid residues are linked to galactose exclusively in an α2->3 configuration. In another embodiment, the invention encompasses preparations comprising wild-type Factor VIIa in which more than 99% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue and at least some of the oligosaccharide chains comprise N-acetylgalactosamine. The present invention does not encompass wild-type Factor VII or wild-type Factor VIIa that is isolated from human plasma and is not modified \nex vivo\n by treatment with glycosidases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the Factor VIIa preparation comprises oligosaccharide chains having a single fucose linked α1->3 to one antennary N-acetylglucosamine. In another embodiment, the Factor VIIa preparation comprises oligosaccharide chains having fucose residues linked 3 to each antennary N-acetylglucosamine of a biantennary oligosaccharide (Sialyl Lewis X structure). In another embodiment, the Factor VIIa preparation comprises oligosaccharide chains having (i) a fucose linked to a core N-acetylglucosamine and (ii) a single fucose linked α1->3 to one antennary N-acetylglucosamine. In another embodiment, the Factor VIIa preparation comprises oligosaccharide chains having (i) a fucose linked to a core N-acetylglucosamine and (ii) fucose residues linked α1->3 to each antennary N-acetylglucosamine of a biantennary oligosaccharide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn practicing the present invention, the pattern of N-linked oligosaccharides may be determined using any method known in the art, including, without limitation: high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); capillary electrophoresis (CE); nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR); mass spectrometry (MS) using ionization techniques such as fast-atom bombardment, electrospray, or matrix-assisted laser desorption (MALDI); gas chromatography (GC); and treatment with exoglycosidases in conjunction with anion-exchange (AIE)-HPLC, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), or MS. See, e.g., \nWeber et al., Anal. Biochem. 225:135 (1995\n); \nKlausen et al., J. Chromatog. 718:195 (1995\n); \nMorris et al., in Mass Spectrometry of Biological Materials, McEwen et al., eds., Marcel Dekker, (1990), pp 137-167\n; \nConboy et al., Biol. Mass Spectrom. 21:397, 1992\n; \nHellerqvist, Meth. Enzymol. 193:554 (1990\n); \nSutton et al., Anal. Biohcem. 318:34 (1994\n); \nHarvey et al., Organic Mass Spectrometry 29:752 (1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing resolution of Factor VII-derived oligosaccharide chains using any of the above methods (or any other method that resolves oligosaccharide chains having different structures), the resolved species are assigned, e.g., to one of groups (i)-(v). The relative content of each of (i)-(v) is calculated as the sum of the oligosaccharides assigned to that group relative to the total content of oligosaccharide chains in the sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, using AIE-HPLC, 13 or more N-linked oligosaccharide peaks can be resolved from a recombinant Factor VII preparation produced in BHK cells. See, e.g., \nKlausen et al., Mol. Biotechnol. 9:195, 1998\n. Five of the peaks (designated 1-5 in Klausen et al.) do not contain sialic acid, while eight of the peaks (designated 6, 7, and 10-15) do contain sialic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood that, in a given analysis, the number and distribution of sialic acid-containing and sialic acid-lacking chains may depend upon (a) the polypeptide being expressed; (b) the cell type and culture conditions; and (c) the method of analysis that is employed, and that the resulting patterns may vary accordingly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn any case, once the sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides have been resolved from the non-sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides, conventional data analysis programs are used to calculate the area under each peak; the total peak area; and the percentage of the total peak area represented by a particular peak. In this manner, for a given preparation, the sum of the areas of sialic acid-containing peaks/total peak area X 100 yields the % sialylation value for the preparation according to the present invention (i.e., the proportion of oligosaccharide chains having at least one sialic acid residue). In a similar manner, the % of chains having no sialic acid or at least one galactose or N-acetylglucosamine can be calculated.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMethods for Producing Factor Vll Preparations Having a Predetermined Pattern of N-linked Oligosaccharides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPreparations of Factor VII, Factor VII variants, or Factor VII-related polypeptides, each having a predetermined pattern of N-linked oligosaccharides, may be produced using any appropriate host cell that expresses Factor VII or Factor Vll-related polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nHost cells\n: In some embodiments, the host cells are human cells expressing an endogenous Factor VII gene. In these cells, the endogenous gene may be intact or may have been modified \nin situ,\n or a sequence outside the Factor VII gene may have been modified \nin situ\n to alter the expression of the endogenous Factor VII gene. Any human cell capable of expressing an endogenous Factor VII gene may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, heterologous host cells are programmed to express human Factor VII from a recombinant gene. The host cells may be vertebrate, insect, or fungal cells. Preferably, the cells are mammalian cells capable of the entire spectrum of mammalian N-linked glycosylation; O-linked glycosylation; and γ-carboxylation. See, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 4,784,950\n \n. Preferred mammalian cell lines include the CHO (ATCC CCL 61), COS-1 (ATCC CRL 1650), baby hamster kidney (BHK) and HEK293 (ATCC CRL 1573; \nGraham et al., J. Gen. Virol. 36:59-72, 1977\n) cell lines. A preferred BHK cell line is the tk' ts13 BHK cell line (\nWaechter and Baserga, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 79:1106-1110, 1982\n), hereinafter referred to as BHK 570 cells. The BHK 570 cell line is available from the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20852, under ATCC accession number CRL 10314. A tk\n-\n ts13 BHK cell line is also available from the ATCC under accession number CRL 1632. In addition, a number of other cell lines may be used, including Rat Hep I (Rat hepatoma; ATCC CRL 1600), Rat Hep II (Rat hepatoma; ATCC CRL 1548), TCMK (ATCC CCL 139), Human lung (ATCC HB 8065), NCTC 1469 (ATCC CCL 9.1) and DUKX cells (CHO cell line) (\nUrlaub and Chasin, Proc. Natf. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216-4220, 1980\n). (DUKX cells also referred to as CXB11 cells), and DG44 (CHO cell line) (\nCell, 33:405, 1983\n, and \nSomatic Cell and Molecular Genetics 12:555, 1986\n). Also useful are 3T3 cells, Namalwa cells, myelomas and fusions of myelomas with other cells. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the host cells are BHK 21 cells that have been adapted to grow in the absence of serum and have been programmed to express Factor VII In some embodiments, the cells may be mutant or recombinant cells that express a qualitatively or quantitatively different spectrum of glycosylation enzymes (such as, e.g., glycosyl transferases and/or glycosidases) than the cell type from which they were derived. The cells may also be programmed to express other heterologous peptides or proteins, including, e.g., truncated forms of Factor VII. In one embodiment, the host cells are CHO cells that have been programmed to co-express both the Factor VII polypeptide of interest (i.e., Factor VII or a Factor-VII-related polypeptide) and another heterologous peptide or polypeptide such as, e.g., a modifying enzyme or a Factor VII fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMethods:\n The present invention encompasses methods for producing a preparation comprising any of the glycoform patterns described above as (i)-(vi) and, in further embodiments, methods for optimizing the glycoform distribution of Factor VII and Factor VII-related polypeptides. These methods are carried out by the steps of:\n\n \n \n \n(a) culturing a cell expressing Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides under a first set of predetermined culture conditions;\n \n(b) recovering Factor VII or FactorVII-related polypeptides from the culture to obtain a preparation comprising the polypeptides; and\n \n(c) analyzing the structure of the oligosaccharides linked to the polypeptides to determine a glycoform pattern.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe methods may further comprise:\n\n \n \n \n(d1) altering the culture conditions of step (a) to achieve a second set of predetermined culture conditions;\n \n(e1) repeating steps (b)-(d1) until a desired glycoform pattern is achieved. Alternatively, the methods may further comprise\n \n(d2) treating the preparation chemically and/or enzymatically to alter the oligosaccharide structure; and\n \n(e2) repeating steps (b)-(d2) until a desired glycoform pattern is achieved.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThese methods may further comprise the step of subjecting preparations having predetermined glycoform patterns to at least one test of bioactivity (including, e.g., clotting, Factor X proteolysis, or TF binding) or other functionality (such as, e.g., pharmacokinetic profile or stability), and correlating particular glycoform patterns with particular bioactivity or functionality profiles in order to identify a desired glycoform pattern.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe variables in the culture conditions that may be altered in step (d1) include, without limitation: the cell of origin, such as, e.g., a cell derived from a different species than originally used; or a mutant or recombinant cell having alterations in one or more glycosyl-transferases or glycosidases or other components of the glycosylation apparatus (see, \nGrabenhorst et al., Glycoconjugate J. 16:81, 1999\n; \nBragonzi et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1474:273, 2000\n; \nWeikert, Nature Biotechnol. 17:1116, 1999\n); the level of expression of the polypeptide; the metabolic conditions such as, e.g., glucose or glutamine concentration; the absence or presence of serum; the concentration of vitamin K; protein hydrolysates, hormones, trace metals, salts as well as process parameters like temperature, dissolved oxygen level and pH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enzymatic treatments that may be used in step (d2) to modify the oligosaccharide pattern of a preparation include, without limitation, treatment with one or more of sialidase (neuraminidase), galactosidase, fucosidase; galactosyl transferase, fucosyl transferase, and/or sialyltransferase, in a sequence and under conditions that achieve a desired modification in the distribution of oligosaccharide chains having particular terminal structures. Glycosyl transferases are commercially available from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and glycosidases are commercially available from Glyko, Inc., (Novato, CA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one series of embodiments, host cells expressing Factor VII or a related polypeptide are subjected to specific culture conditions in which they secrete glycosylated Factor VII polypeptides having the desired pattern of oligosaccharide structures described above as any of (i)-(vi). Such culture conditions include, without limitation, a reduction in, or complete absence of, serum. Preferably, the host cells are adapted to grow in the absence of serum and are cultured in the absence of serum both in the growth phase and in the production phase. Such adaptation procedures are described, e.g., in \nScharfenberg, et al., Animal Cell Technology Developments towards the 21st Century, E. C. Beuvery et al. (Eds.), Kluwer Academic Publishers, pp. 619-623, 1995\n (BHK and CHO cells); \nCruz, Biotechnol. Tech. 11:117-120, 1997\n (insect cells); \nKeen, Cytotechnol. 17:203-211, 1995\n (myeloma cells); \nBerg et al., Biotechniques 14:972-978, 1993\n (human kidney 293 cells). In a preferred embodiment, the growth medium that is added to the cells contains no protein or other component that was isolated from an animal tissue or an animal cell culture. See, e.g., Example 1 below. Typically, in addition to conventional components, a medium suitable for producing Factor VII contains Vitamin K at a concentration between 0.1-50 mg/liter, which is required for γ-carboxylation of glutamine residues in Factor VII.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another series of embodiments, the glycoforms of the invention are produced by subjecting a preparation of Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides to enzymatic and/or chemical modification of the N-linked oligosaccharides contained therein.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFactor VII Preparations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, a \"Factor VII preparation\" refers to a plurality of Factor VII polypeptides, Factor VIIa polypeptides, or Factor VII-related polypeptides, including variants and chemically modified forms, that have been separated from the cell in which they were synthesized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeparation of polypeptides from their cell of origin may be achieved by any method known in the art, including, without limitation, removal of cell culture medium containing the desired product from an adherent cell culture; centrifugation or filtration to remove non-adherent cells; and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, Factor VII polypeptides may be further purified. Purification may be achieved using any method known in the art, including, without limitation, affinity chromatography, such as, e.g., on an anti-Factor VII antibody column (see, e.g., \nWakabayashi et al., J. Biol. Chem. 261:11097, 1986\n; and \nThim et al., Biochem. 27:7785, 1988\n); hydrophobic interaction chromatography; ion-exchange chromatography; size exclusion chromatography; electrophoretic procedures (e.g., preparative isoelectric focusing (IEF), differential solubility (e.g., ammonium sulfate precipitation), or extraction and the like. See, generally, \nScopes, Protein Purification, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1982\n; and \nProtein Purification, J.-C. Janson and Lars Ryden, editors, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989\n. Following purification, the preparation preferably contains less than about 10% by weight, more preferably less than about 5% and most preferably less than about 1%, of non-Factor VII proteins derived from the host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor VII and Factor Vll-related polypeptides may be activated by proteolytic cleavage, using Factor XIIa or other proteases having trypsin-like specificity, such as, e.g., Factor IXa, kallikrein, Factor Xa, and thrombin. See, e.g., \nOsterud et al., Biochem. 11:2853 (1972\n); \n \nThomas, U.S. Patent No. 4,456,591\n \n; and \nHedner et al., J. Clin. Invest. 71:1836 (1983\n). Alternatively, Factor VII may be activated by passing it through an ion-exchange chromatography column, such as Mono Q® (Pharmacia) or the like. The resulting activated Factor VII may then be formulated and administered as described below.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFunctional Properties of Factor VII Preparations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe preparations of Factor VII polypeptides and Factor VII-related polypeptides having predetermined oligosaccharide patterns according to the invention exhibit improved functional properties relative to reference preparations. The improved functional properties may include, without limitation, a) physical properties such as, e.g., storage stability; b) pharmacokinetic properties such as, e.g., bioavailability and half-life; and c) immunogenicity in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA reference preparation refers to a preparation comprising a polypeptide that is identical to that contained in the preparation of the invention to which it is being compared (such as, e.g., wild-type Factor VII or a particular variant or chemically modified form) except for exhibiting a different pattern of asparagine-linked glycosylation. For example, reference preparations typically comprise one or more of the following glycoform patterns: (i) less than about 93% (such as, e.g. less than about 92% or less than about 90%) of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue; (ii) at least about 6% (such as, e.g., at least about 7.5% or at least about 10%) of the oligosaccharide chains lack any sialic acid (i.e., are neutral); (iii) at least about 10% (such as, e.g., at least about 12.5% or at least about 15%) of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one terminal galactose residue; (iv) at least about 15% (such as, e.g., at least about 20% or at least about 25%) of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; (v) at least about 25% (such as, e.g., at least about 30% or at least about 35%) of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one uncapped antenna (i.e., contain at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue); or (vi) essentially undetectable levels (such as, e.g., less than about 0.2%) of antennary fucose residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStorage stability of a Factor VII preparation may be assessed by measuring (a) the time required for 20% of the bioactivity of a preparation to decay when stored as a dry powder at 25°C and/or (b) the time required for a doubling in the proportion of Factor VIIa aggregates in the preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the preparations of the invention exhibit an increase of at least about 30%, preferably at least about 60% and more preferably at least about 100%, in the time required for 20% of the bioactivity to decay relative to the time required for the same phenomenon in a reference preparation, when both preparations are stored as dry powders at 25°C. Bioactivity measurements may be performed using any of a clotting assay, proteolysis assay, TF-binding assay, or TF-independent thrombin generation assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the preparations of the invention exhibit an increase of at least about 30%, preferably at least about 60%, and more preferably at least about 100%, in the time required for doubling of aggregates relative to a reference preparation, when both preparations are stored as dry powders at 25°C. The content of aggregates is determined by gel permeation HPLC on a Protein Pak 300 SW column (7.5 x 300 mm) (Waters, 80013) as follows. The column is equilibrated with Eluent A (0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 5 % isopropanol, pH adjusted to 2.5 with phosphoric acid, and thereafter pH is adjusted to 7.0 with triethylamine), after which 25 µg of sample is applied to the column. Elution is with Eluent A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 30 min, and detection is achieved by measuring absorbance at 215 nm. The content of aggregates is calculated as the peak area of the Factor VII aggregates/total area of Factor VII peaks (monomer and aggregates).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Bioavailability\" refers to the proportion of an administered dose of a Factor VII or Factor Vll-related preparation that can be detected in plasma at predetermined times after administration. Typically, bioavailability is measured in test animals by administering a dose of between about 25-250 µg/kg of the preparation; obtaining plasma samples at predetermined times after administration; and determining the content of Factor VII or Factor Vll-related polypeptides in the samples using one or more of a clotting assay (or any bioassay), an immunoassay, or an equivalent. The data are typically displayed graphically as [Factor VII] v. time and the bioavailability is expressed as the area under the curve (AUC). Relative bioavailability of a test preparation refers to the ratio between the AUC of the test preparation and that of the reference preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the preparations of the present invention exhibit a relative bioavailability of at least about 110%, preferably at least about 120%, more preferably at least about 130% and most preferably at least about 140% of the bioavailability of a reference preparation. The bioavailability may be measured in any mammalian species, preferably dogs, and the predetermined times used for calculating AUC may encompass different increments from 10 min- 8 h.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Half-life\" refers to the time required for the plasma concentration of Factor VII polypeptides of Factor VII-related polypeptides to decrease from a particular value to half of that value. Half-life may be determined using the same procedure as for bioavailability. In some embodiments, the preparations of the present invention exhibit an increase in half-life of at least about 0.25 h, preferably at least about 0.5 h, more preferably at least about 1 h, and most preferably at least about 2 h, relative to the half-life of a reference preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Immunogenicity\" of a preparation refers to the ability of the preparation, when administered to a human, to elicit a deleterious immune response, whether humoral, cellular, or both. Factor VIIa polypeptides and Factor VIIa-related polypeptides are not known to elicit detectable immune responses in humans. Nonetheless, in any human sub-population, there may exist individuals who exhibit sensitivity to particular administered proteins. Immunogenicity may be measured by quantifying the presence of anti-Factor VII antibodies and/or Factor VII-responsive T-cells in a sensitive individual, using conventional methods known in the art. In some embodiments, the preparations of the present invention exhibit a decrease in immunogenicity in a sensitive individual of at least about 10%, preferably at least about 25%, more preferably at least about 40% and most preferably at least about 50%, relative to the immunogenicity for that individual of a reference preparation.\n\n\n \n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Use\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe preparations of the present invention may be used to treat any Factor VII-responsive syndrome, such as, e.g., bleeding disorders, including, without limitation, those caused by clotting factor deficiencies (e.g., haemophilia A and B or deficiency of coagulation factors XI or VII); by thrombocytopenia or von Willebrand's disease, or by clotting factor inhibitors, or excessive bleeding from any cause. The preparations may also be administered to patients in association with surgery or other trauma or to patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations comprising Factor VII-related polypeptides according to the invention, which have substantially reduced bioactivity relative to wild-type Factor VII, may be used as anticoagulants, such as, e.g., in patients undergoing angioplasty or other surgical procedures that may increase the risk of thrombosis or occlusion of blood vessels as occurs, e.g., in restenosis. Other medical indications for which anticoagulants are prescribed include, without limitation, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DlC), fibrin deposition in lungs and kidneys associated with gram-negative endotoxemia, myocardial infarction; Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), MOF, and TTP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions comprising the Factor VII and Factor Vll-related preparations according to the present are primarily intended for parenteral administration for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment. Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered parenterally, i.e., intravenously, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly. They may be administered by continuous or pulsatile infusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions or formulations comprise a preparation according to the invention in combination with, preferably dissolved in, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, preferably an aqueous carrier or diluent. A variety of aqueous carriers may be used, such as water, buffered water, 0.4% saline, 0.3% glycine and the like. The preparations of the invention can also be formulated into liposome preparations for delivery or targeting to the sites of injury. Liposome preparations are generally described in, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patents Nos. 4,837,028\n \n, \n \n4,501,728\n \n, and \n \n4,975,282\n \n. The compositions may be sterilised by conventional, well-known sterilisation techniques. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use or filtered under aseptic conditions and lyophilised, the lyophilised preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous solution prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances or adjuvants, including, without limitation, pH adjusting and buffering agents and/or tonicity adjusting agents, such as, for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concentration of Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides in these formulations can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.5% by weight, usually at or at least about 1% by weight to as much as 15 or 20% by weight and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, a typical pharmaceutical composition for intravenous infusion could be made up to contain 250 ml of sterile Ringer's solution and 10 mg of the preparation. Actual methods for preparing parenterally administrable compositions will be known or apparent to those skilled in the art and are described in more detail in, for example, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA (1990\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions containing the preparations of the present invention can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a subject already suffering from a disease, as described above, in an amount sufficient to cure, alleviate or partially arrest the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as \"therapeutically effective amount\". Effective amounts for each purpose will depend on the severity of the disease or injury as well as the weight and general state of the subject. In general, however, the effective amount will range from about 0.05 mg up to about 500 mg of the preparation per day for a 70 kg subject, with dosages of from about 1.0 mg to about 200 mg of the preparation per day being more commonly used. It will be understood that determining an appropriate dosage may be achieved using routine experimentation, by constructing a matrix of values and testing different points in the matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLocal delivery of the preparations of the present invention, such as, for example, topical application, may be carried out, e.g., by means of a spray, perfusion, double balloon catheters, stent, incorporated into vascular grafts or stents, hydrogels used to coat balloon catheters, or other well established methods. In any event, the pharmaceutical compositions should provide a quantity of the preparation sufficient to effectively treat the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may further comprise other bioactive agents, such as, e.g., non-Factor Vll-related coagulants or anticoagulants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are intended as non-limiting illustrations of the present invention.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 1: Production and Analysis of a Factor VII preparation exhibiting an altered glycoform pattern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following experiment was performed to produce a Factor VII preparation having an altered glycoform pattern.\n\n \n \n \nI. \nProduction:\n A BHK cell line transformed with a Factor VII-encoding plasmid was adapted to growth in suspension culture in the absence of serum. The cells were propagated sequentially in spinner cultures and as the cell number increased, the volume was gradually increased by addition of new medium.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nFinally, 6 of seed culture were inoculated into a 1 00-liter production bioreactor containing macroporous Cytopore 1 carriers (Pharmacia), after which the suspension cells became immobilized in the carriers. The culture was maintained at 36\n°\nC at a pH of 6.7-6.9 and a DO of 50%. The volume in the production bioreactor was gradually increased by addition of new medium as the cell number increased. When the cell density reached approximately 2 x 10\n6\n cells/ml, the production phase was initiated and a medium change was performed every 24 hours: Agitation was stopped to allow for sedimentation of the cell-containing carriers, and 80% of the culture supernatant was then harvested and replaced with new medium. The harvested culture supernatant was filtered to remove non-trapped cells and cell debris and was then transferred for further processing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring the production phase the cells reached 3-6 x 10\n6\n cells/ml and a titer of 2-7 mg Factor VII/liter.\n\n\n \nII. \n \nAnalvsis of the glycoform pattern of recombinant Factor VII\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe oligosaccharide patterns of the following preparations were compared: (a) recombinant Factor VII preparations produced as described in part I (n=7); and two reference preparations: (b) recombinant Factor VII preparations produced in BHK cells in the presence of calf serum (n=10); and (c) a Factor VII preparation purified from human plasma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe N-linked oligosaccharides were released from the polypeptides by chemical cleavage (hydrazinolysis, on a GlycoPrep1000 unit, Oxford GlycoSciences) or by enzymatic cleavage (N-glycosidase F from, eg., Boehringer Mannheim). The released oligosaccharides were labeled with 2-aminobenzamide (using a signal labelling kit, K-404, Oxford GlycoSciences or Glyko). The labeled oligosaccharides were analysed using anion-exchange HPLC on a CarboPac PA100 column (4x250 mm, Dionex, P/N 43055) with a Guard column (4x50 mm, Dionex, P/N 43054). The column was equilibrated with 150 mM sodium hydroxide and eluted with a gradient of 0-150 mM sodium acetate, 150 mM sodium hydroxide. Oligosaccharides were detected using fluorescence, with excitation at 330 nm and emission at 420 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe relative contents of the various Factor VII oligosaccharide structures (Klausen et al., 1998) were calculated as the relative peak areas for the carbohydrate peaks in the anion-exchange HPLC analysis. Based on the structural elements of each oligosaccharide, it was assigned to one of the following: (i) chains containing at least one sialic acid; (ii) chains lacking any sialic acid (i.e., neutral); (iii) chains containing at least one terminal-galactose residue; (iv) chains containing at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; and (v) chains containing at least one uncapped antenna (i.e., at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue). Finally, the sum of the relative contents of the oligosaccharide chains assigned to each group was calculated as a percentage of the total oligosaccharide chains. The standard deviation of this determination was calculated to be 0.08% (intraday variation); 0.7% (day-to-day variation); and 0.5% (1-100 µg interval).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting glycoform patterns are illustrated in the following table:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(i)\n \n(ii)\n \n(iii)\n \n(iv)\n \n(v)\n \n \n \n \n \na\n \n \n93.1-98.7\n \n1.3-6.9\n \n5.9-16.4\n \n5.9-8.7\n \n11.7-23.9\n \n \n \n \nb\n \n \n88.3-92.5\n \n7.5-12.9\n \n9.4-16.8\n \n19.0-28.6\n \n30.1-39.0\n \n \n \n \nc\n \n \n99.5%\n \n<0.5%\n \n2-3%\n \n0%\n \n2-3%\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\nThe recombinant Factor VII preparations produced according to this Example (i.e., in the absence of serum) exhibit a glycoform pattern that differs from both the glycoform pattern of recombinant Factor VII produced in the presence of serum and native Factor VII isolated from human plasma. The oligosaccharides of recombinant Factor VII produced in the absence of serum are sialylated to a higher extent than those produced in the presence of serum and contain less neutral chains and less chains that terminate in either galactose or N-acetylgalatosamine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIII. \nBioavailability:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe following experiment was performed to compare the bioavailability of two Factor VII preparations produced as above (I and II) with that of two reference Factor VII preparations (i.e., produced in the presence of serum) (A and B).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroups of 8 rats were administered either a test preparation or a reference preparation at a dose of 25 µg/kg (= 100 µg/rat) in a glycylglycine buffer (pH 7.4) containing sodium chloride (7.87 mg/ml), calcium chloride dihydrate (1.48 mg/ml), mannitol (2.5 mg/ml) and polysorbate 80. Blood samples were withdrawn at 10 min and 30 min following the initial administration. Plasma was obtained from the samples and Factor VII was quantified by ELISA. Bioavailability of each sample is expressed as the dose-adjusted area under the plasma concentration curve for Factor VII based on the 10 and 30-min samples (AUC\n10-30\n/dose). The relative bioavailability is expressed as the ratio between the mean AUC\n10-30\n/dose of the test and reference samples X 100. The 90% confidence limits for the relative bioavailability were calculated from the 90% confidence limits for differences between preparations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are summarized in the Table below.

A 10% increase in the % sialylation, moreover, causes a 40-50% increase in bioavailability.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2: \nAnalysis of Factor VII preparations exhibiting an altered glycoform pattern\n.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFactor VII was produced as described in Example 1 above, with the exception that the Factor VII was harvested from 500-1 cultures. Glycoform analysis was performed as described in Example 1. Three independent preparations (A, B, and C) were analyzed and compared with a reference preparation (D).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBioavailability was measured in a dog model as follows: The experiment was performed as a four leg cross-over study in 12 Beagle dogs divided in four groups. All animals received each of the three test preparations A, B, and C and the reference preparation D at a dose of =90 \nµ\ng/kg in a glycylglycine buffer (pH 5.5) containing sodium chloride (2.92 mg/ml), calcium chloride dihydrate (1.47 mg/ml), mannitol (30 mg/ml) and polysorbate 80. Blood samples were withdrawn at 10, 30, and 60 minutes and 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours following the initial administration.

A 10% increase in the % sialylation causes a 30-50% increase in bioavailability with a close to linear relationship for the three test preparations and the reference preparation\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Factor VII preparations exhibiting an altered glycoform pattern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following experiment was performed to produce a Factor VII preparation having an altered glycoform pattern.\n\n\n \n\n\nI. Construction of cell line and Factor VII production:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA plasmid vector pLN174 for expression of human FVII has been described (\nPersson and Nielsen. 1996. FEBS Lett. 385: 241-243\n). Briefly, it carries the cDNA nucleotide sequence encoding human FVII including the propeptide under the control of a mouse metal-lothionein promoter for transcription of the inserted cDNA, and mouse dihydrofolate reduc-tase cDNA under the control of an SV40 early promoter for use as a selectable marker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor construction of a plasmid vector encoding a gamma-carboxylation recognition sequence, a cloning vector (pBluescript II KS+, Stratagene) containing cDNA encoding FVII including its propeptide was used (pLN171). (\nPersson et al. 1997. J. BioL Chem. 272: 19919-19924\n). A nucleotide sequence encoding a stop codon was inserted into the cDNA encoding FVII after the propeptide of FVII by inverse PCR-mediated mutagenesis using this cloning vector. The template plasmid was denatured by treatment with NaOH followed by PCR with Pwo (Boehringer-Mannheim) and Taq (Perkin-Elmer) polymerases with the following primers:\n\n \n \n \na) 5'-AGC GTT TTA GCG CCG GCG CCG GTG CAG GAC-3'\n \nb) 5'-CGC CGG CGC TAA AAC GCT TTC CTG GAG GAG CTG CGG CC-3'\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe resulting mix was digested with Dpnl to digest residual template DNA and \nEscherichia coli\n were transformed with the PCR product. Clones were screened for the presence of the mutation by sequencing. The cDNA from a correct clone was transferred as a BamHl-EcoRl fragment to the expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was termed pLN329. CHO K1 cells (ATCC CCl61) were transfected with equal amounts of pLN174 and pLN329 with the Fugene6 method (Boehriner-Mannheim). Transfectants were selected by the addition of methotrexate to 1µM and G-418 to 0.45 mg/ml. The pool of transfectants were cloned by limiting dilution and FVII expression from the clones was measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA high producing clone was further subcloned and a clone E11 with a specific FVII expression of 2.4 pg/cell/day in Dulbecco-modified Eagle's medium with 10 % fetal calf serum was selected. The clone was adapted to serum free suspension culture in a commercially available CHO medium (JRH Bioscience) free of animal derived components.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe adapted cells were propagated sequentially in spinner cultures and as the cell number increased, the volume was gradually increased by addition of new medium. After 25 days, 61 of spinner culture were inoculated into a 50-liter bioreactor. The cells were propagated in the bioreactor and as the cell number increased, the volume was gradually increased by addition of new medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, 50 l of seed culture were inoculated into a 500-liter production bioreactor containing macroporous Cytopore 1 carriers (Pharmacia), after which the suspension cells became immobilized in the carriers. The culture was maintained at 36\n°\nC at a pH of 7.0-7.1 and a Dissolved Oxygen Tension (DOT) of 50% of saturation. The volume in the bioreactor was gradually increased by addition of new medium as the cell number increased. When the cell density reached approximately 10-12 x 105 cells/ml, the production phase was initiated and a medium change was performed every 24 hours: agitation was stopped to allow for sedimentation of the cell-containing carriers, and 80% of the culture supernatant was then harvested and replaced with new medium. The harvested culture supernatant was filtered to remove non-trapped cells (i.e. cells that were not immobilized in carriers) and cell debris and was then transferred for further processing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring the production phase the cells reached 2-3 x 107 cells/ml and a titer of 8 mg Factor VII/liter.\n\n\n \nII. \nGlycoform Analysis:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nA. The oligosaccharide pattern of a Factor VII preparation produced as described above (a) was compared with those of (b) recombinant Factor VII preparations produced in BHK cells in the presence of calf serum and (c) a Factor VII preparation purified from human plasma. The methods used were essentially as described in Example 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are shown in the Table below. The oligosaccharide assignments are as follows: (i) chains containing at least one sialic acid; (ii) chains lacking any sialic acid (i.e., neutral); (iii) chains containing at least one terminal galactose residue; (iv) chains containing at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; and (v) chains containing at least one uncapped antenna (i.e., at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue).\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(i)\n \n(ii)\n \n(iii)\n \n(iv)\n \n(v)\n \n \n \n \na\n \n95.2\n \n4.8\n \n22.9\n \n0.1\n \n23.0\n \n \n \nb\n \n88.3-92.5\n \n7.5-12.9\n \n9.4-16.8\n \n19.0-28.6\n \n30.1-39.0\n \n \n \nc\n \n99.5%\n \n<0.5%\n \n2-3%\n \n0%\n \n2-3%\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nB.

Finally, the sum of the relative contents of the oligosaccharide chains assigned to each group was calculated as a percentage of the total oligosaccharide chains. The standard deviation of this determination was calculated to be 0.08% (intraday variation); 0.7% (day-to-day variation); and 0.5% (1-100 µg interval).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting glycoform patterns are illustrated in the following Table:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(i)\n \n(ii)\n \n(iii)\n \n \n \n \na\n \n89.0-97.9%\n \n2.1-11.0%\n \n6.3-21.3%\n \n \n \nb\n \n88.3-92.5%\n \n7.5-12.9%\n \n0%\n \n \n \nc\n \n99.5%\n \n<0.5%\n \n0%\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recombinant Factor VII preparations produced according to Example 1 (i.e., produced in the absence of serum by the CHO cell line) exhibit a glycoform pattern that differs from both the glycoform pattern of recombinant Factor VII produced in the presence of serum and native Factor VII isolated from human plasma. The oligosaccharides of recombinant Factor VII produced in the absence of serum by the CHO 282.4 cell line include structures with fucose linked to the antenna, which are absent from both of the reference preparations. Two of the structures have been purified and characterized by matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry, by treatment with linkage specific fucosidase enzymes and by anion-exchange HPLC as described above. The two structures have been shown to contain the sialyl Lewis x structure, i.e., fucose linked α1→3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine in a sialylated oligosaccharide.\n\n\n \nIII. \nBioactivity:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nFive Factor VII preparations produced as described in this Example were analyzed for (a) thrombin generation and (b) binding to tissue factor (TF) and compared with recombinant Factor VII produced in BHK cells in the presence of serum (reference).

The assay is carried out in a microtiter plate (MaxiSorp, Nunc, Denmark). The chromogenic substrate D-lle-Pro-Arg-\np\n-nitroanilide (S-2288, Chromogenix, Sweden), at a final concentration of 1 mM, is added to Factor VIIa (final concentration 100 nM) in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl\n2\n and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The absorbance at 405 nm is measured continuously in a SpectraMax™ 340 plate reader (Molecular Devices, USA). The absorbance developed during a 20-minute incubation, after subtraction of the absorbance in a blank well containing no enzyme, is used to calculate the ratio between the activities of a test and a reference Factor VIIa.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5: \n \nIn Vitro\n Proteolysis Assay\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following method can be used to assay Factor VIIa bioactivity.

Factor VIIa (10 nM) and Factor X (0.8 microM) in 100 µl 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl\n2\n and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, are incubated for 15 min. Factor X cleavage is then stopped by the addition of 50µl 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The amount of Factor Xa generated is measured by addition of the chromogenic substrate Z-D-Arg-Gly-Arg-\np\n-nitroanilide (S-2765, Chromogenix, Sweden), final concentration 0.5 mM. The absorbance at 405 nm is measured continuously in a SpectraMax™ 340 plate reader (Molecular Devices, USA).

Description\n\n\n\n\nSTATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention was made in part with government support from the National Institute of Health. The government has certain rights in this invention.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nMetabotropic glutamate receptors are G-coupled protein receptors that modulate intracellular second messenger systems. Agonist binding to the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) stimulates phospholipase C, which results in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and mobilization of intracellular calcium. Animal studies suggest mGluR5 is impaired or otherwise abnormal (e.g., with regard to density and distribution) in several human disorders, including anxiety, schizophrenia, substance abuse, and fragile X syndrome. In response to these animal studies, several drugs that modulate mGluR5 function are being developed. The drug target on mGluR5 is distinct from the glutamate binding site. Instead, the drug target is an allosteric (or noncompetitive) site that can either increase or decrease function via positive or negative allosteric modulation, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus far, drugs prepared as effective modulators of the allosteric site of the mGluR5 have not proven useful as therapeutic agents. Radiolabeled agents specific to the allosteric site of mGluR5 are needed to elucidate the activity of mGluR5 modulators in living brain by imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) or other modalities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inventors hereof have previously reported an effective mGluR5 PET imaging agent, 3-fluoro-5-[[2-([\n18\nF]fluoromethyl)thiazol-4-yl]ethynyl]benzonitrile ([\n18\nF]SP203). This compound is rapidly defluorinated in monkey and rat, although defluorination is slower or negligible in human subjects. In brain PET scans, radiodefluorination hampers quantification of brain mGluR5 density in non-human subjects since \n18\nF-labeled fluoride ion accumulates in nearby bone (e.g. skull), leading to ‘spillover of radioactivity’ through the partial volume effect. Thus there remains a need for an effective mGluR5 allosteric site modulator that can be radiolabeled for use in imaging animals and human subjects with PET or other brain imaging techniques. The present 2-fluorothiazole compounds, compositions, and methods fulfill this need and provide additional advantages described herein.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nDescribed herein are 2-fluorothiazole derivatives (including radiolabeled 2-fluorothiazole derivatives useful as labeled imaging agents), their methods of manufacture, compositions containing the 2-fluorothiazole derivatives, and methods of use of both the 2-fluorothiazole derivatives and compositions thereof.

When the substituent is oxo (i.e., ═O), then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. When aromatic moieties are substituted by an oxo group, the aromatic ring is replaced by the corresponding partially unsaturated ring. For example a pyridyl group substituted by oxo is a pyridone. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds or useful synthetic intermediates. A stable compound or stable structure is meant to imply a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation from a reaction mixture, and subsequent formulation into an effective therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA dash (“-”) that is not between two letters or symbols is used to indicate a point of attachment for a substituent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Alkyl” includes both branched and straight chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups, having the specified number of carbon atoms. The term C\n1\n-C\n2\nalkyl as used herein means an alkyl group having from 1 to about 2 carbon atoms, e.g., methyl and ethyl, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Alkylnitrile” is an alkyl group, as defined above, with the indicated number of carbon atoms substituted with a cyano (C≡N) group. The alkylnitrile is attached to the group it substitutes through by a covalent bond to its alkyl portion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Alkoxy” means an alkyl group, as defined above, with the indicated number of carbon atoms attached via an oxygen bridge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Aryl” is an aromatic group containing only carbon in the aromatic ring or rings. Certain aryl groups contain 1 to 2 separate, fused, or pendant rings and from 6 to about 12 ring atoms in total, without heteroatoms as ring members. Such aryl groups may be further substituted with carbon or non-carbon atoms or groups. Substituents include hydroxyl, amino, cyano, nitro, halogen, C\n1\n-C\n2\nalkyl, and C\n1\n-C\n2\nalkoxy. “Halo” or “halogen” means fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Pharmaceutical compositions” means compositions comprising at least one active agent, such as a compound or salt of the invention, and at least one other substance, such as a carrier. Pharmaceutical compositions meet the U.S. FDA's GMP (good manufacturing practice) standards for human or non-human drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Carrier” means a diluent, excipient, or vehicle with which an active compound is administered. A “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” means a substance, e.g., excipient, diluent, or vehicle, that is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes a carrier that is acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. A “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes both one and more than one such carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “patient” means a human or non-human animal in need of medical treatment. Medical treatment can include treatment of an existing condition, such as a disease or disorder, prophylactic or preventative treatment, or diagnostic treatment. In some embodiments the patient is a human patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Providing” means giving, administering, selling, distributing, transferring (for profit or not), manufacturing, compounding, or dispensing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Treatment” or “treating” includes providing an active compound in an amount sufficient to: (a) prevent a disease or a symptom of a disease from occurring in a patient who may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it (e.g., including diseases that may be associated with or caused by a primary disease; (b) inhibit the disease, i.e., arrest its development; and (c) relieve the disease, i.e., cause regression of the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “therapeutically effective amount” of a pharmaceutical composition means an amount effective, when administered to a patient, to provide a therapeutic benefit such as an amelioration of symptoms, e.g., an amount effective to decrease the symptoms of an mGluR5 mediated disorder. For example, in a patient having depression an effective amount would be an amount that results in any statistically significant improvement in the patients HAMD score upon treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA significant change is any detectable change that is statistically significant in a standard parametric test of statistical significance such as Student's T-test, where p<0.05.\n\n\n \nChemical\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of Formula I are useful for imaging mGluR5, for example by PET and SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) imaging of mGluR5. The labeled compounds disclosed herein exhibit high binding affinity and specificity for mGluR5, with low non-specific binding for the non-target tissues or cells. Most previously reported \n18\nF-labeled 2-fluoromethyl thiazole compounds exhibited high radiodefluorination in some mammalian species limiting the utility of these compounds. Direct fluorination at the thiazole 2-position is believed to minimize or abolish radiodefluorination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to compounds of Formula I, II, and III described above, specific 2-fluorothiazole derivatives include the compounds of Formula I, II, and III in which the variables have the meanings set forth below, or example compounds of Formula I, II, and III in which any of the following conditions are met:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(i) R\n3 \nis hydrogen and R\n4 \nis 0 substituents (absent).\n \n(ii) R\n1 \nis hydrogen, halogen, or cyano, C\n1\n-C\n2\nalkylnitrile; and R\n2 \nis hydrogen, halogen, cyano or C\n1\n-C\n2\nalkylnitrile.\n \n(iii) R\n1 \nis hydrogen or fluoro; and R\n2 \nis hydrogen or cyano.\n \n(iv) R\n1 \nis hydrogen or fluoro; and R\n2 \nis hydrogen or cyano.\n \n(v) R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare both hydrogen.\n \n(vi) R\n1 \nis hydrogen and R\n2 \nis cyano.\n \n(vii) R\n1 \nis fluoro and R\n2 \nis cyano.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAlso included are all radioisotopes of Formula I, II, and III. For example radioiodinated compounds in which a halogen at R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3 \nor X is \n123\nI, \n124\nI, \n125\nI are included herein. These compounds can be prepared by the methods given herein, with routine modifications that are readily apparent to those of skill in the art of organic chemistry synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the above conditions, (i) to (vii), may be combined so long as an isolatable compound results. For example, the radiolabeled 2-fluorothiazole derivatives include a compound of Formula I in which condition (i) and (vii) are combined, that is, R\n3 \nis hydrogen and R\n4 \nis 0 substituents, and R\n1 \nis fluoro and R\n2 \nis cyano, i.e., a compound of the formula\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment provides method of imaging mGluR5 in a mammal by administering a compound of Formula I to the mammal and imaging portions of the mammal where mGluR5 occurs. In certain embodiments the mammal is a mouse, a rat, a monkey or a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImaging methods include in vitro methods such as contacting a sample containing mGluR5 with a compound of Formula I, removing the unbound compound from the sample, and detecting the bound compound in the sample. Typically the sample will be a brain section prepared for autoradiography, and the detecting is via autoradiography.\n\n\n \nSynthetic Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nIn still another aspect, methods for making compounds of Formulas I and II and methods for preparing intermediates of Formulas I and II are described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso provided is a method of making a compound of Formula I comprising heating a compound of the formula\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwhere X is a halogen radical selected from chloro, bromo, and iodo; or X is nitro, trimethylammonium, or X is an aryliodonium entity (ArI\n+\n), where Ar may be Ph or 2-thienyl or substituted Ph, especially methoxy substituted, or 2-thienyl or substituted 2-thienyl, especially methyl-substituted;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwith [\n18\nF]F\n−\n—K\n+\n-Kryptofix® 222 or [\n18\nF]F\n−\n—K\n+\n-18-Crown-6 in an organic solvent under microwave or thermal heating conditions to provide a compound of Formula I, or with [\n18\nF]FCs, in the presence or absence of K\n+\n-4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane, or with \n18\nF\n−\n in the presence of tetra-alkylammonium (R\n4\nN\n+\n), where R is preferably Et, n-Bu or t-Bu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[\n18\nF]F\n−\n—K\n+\n-4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane is also known as a [\n18\nF]F\n−\n—K\n+\n-Kryptofix® 222 complex. (Kryptofix is a registered trademark of Merck KGAA Ltd.). The [\n18\nF]F\n−\n—K\n+\n-Kryptofix® 222 complex may be prepared, for example, by adding an aqueous solution of potassium carbonate and Kryptofix® 222 to an aqueous solution containing the [\n18\nF]fluoride ion. The [\n18\nF]F\n−\n—K\n+\n-Kryptofix® 222 complex can be isolated by drying the complex and dissolution in acetonitrile (MeCN) or other similarly polar solvent such as ethanol, methanol, or dioxane. Other well-known variants of this procedure may be used to produce the same complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadiofluorination is effected, for example, by heating the precursor compound with [\n18\nF]F\n−\n—K\n+\n-Kryptofix® 222 in a non-polar solvent such as MeCN, dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or other nonpolar solvent, under microwave irradiation or thermal conditions. When microwave irradiation is used the conditions are about 30 to 90W, (from about 80 to about 150° C.), for about 2 minutes to about 30 minutes, or more commonly about 5 minutes to about 10 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA method of preparing a compound of Formula II comprises contacting a compound of the formula\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein X is a halogen radical selected from chloro, bromo, iodo or nitro; with KF, CsF or a KF-AgF mixture in an organic solvent, such as DMSO, MeCN, DMF, butanol, with Kryptofix® 222 or 18-Crown-6 under microwave conditions or thermal heating to provide a compound of Formula II. The microwave conditions include microwave irradiation at about 50 W, (about 10 minutes at about 130° C.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above methods the variables R\n1 \nto R\n4 \nmay carry any of the values set forth for these variables in conditions (i) to (vii) in the Chemical Description section.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the intermediate\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nis provided by halogenating a compound of the formula\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwith\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(i) CuX\n1\n, where X\n1 \nis chloro, bromo, or iodo, in the presence of n-butyl nitrite; or\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(ii) alumina-KCuBr\n2 \n(a preparation of KBr and CuBr on neutral alumina). In one embodiment, the 2-amino compound is dissolved in a polar solvent, such as acetonitrile at room temperature. The compound is heated in the presence of a nitrite (such as about 1 to 2 equivalents of n-butyl nitrite, tert-butyl nitrite or amyl nitrite) and alumina-KCuX\n2 \nor CuX. The reaction proceeds at room temperature (with alumina complex) for 24 hours or proceeds at 40-85° C. (with copper salt) for about 10 minutes to about 1 hour (SCHEME 1).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the chlorothiazole derivatives of type (5a to 5e), were directly prepared by Sonogashira coupling of (17) with the appropriate haloarenes (SCHEME 2).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preferred route to prepare radiolabeled compounds [\n18\nF]12-16 is described later in Scheme 4 (example 1). However, in another aspect of this invention, an alternate synthetic route, shown in SCHEME 3, below, was designed to produce radiolabeled compounds [\n18\nF]12-16. In this case, compound 17 was reacted with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in THF at room temperature to give the 2-chloro-4-ethynyl-1,3-thiazole 18.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcetylene 18 can be conveniently labeled by reaction with [\n18\nF]fluoride ion in the presence of kryptofix® 222 or ether 18-crown-6 to give the radiosynthon 19 (Scheme 3). Sonogashira cross-coupling of 19 with the appropriate aryl halide can produce [\n18\nF]12-16.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Preparations\n\n\n \n \n \nThe 2-fluorothiazole derivatives can be administered as the neat chemical, but are preferably administered as a pharmaceutical composition, for example a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a 2-fluorothiazole derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 2-fluorothiazole derivatives may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation or spray, sublingually, transdermally, via buccal administration, rectally, as an ophthalmic solution, or by other means, in dosage unit formulations containing conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The pharmaceutical composition may be formulated as any pharmaceutically useful form, e.g., as an aerosol, a cream, a gel, a pill, a capsule, a tablet, a syrup, a transdermal patch, or an ophthalmic solution. Some dosage forms, such as tablets and capsules, are subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active components, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarriers include excipients and diluents and must be of sufficiently high purity and sufficiently low toxicity to render them suitable for administration to the patient being treated. The carrier can be inert or it can possess pharmaceutical benefits of its own. The amount of carrier employed in conjunction with the compound is sufficient to provide a practical quantity of material for administration per unit dose of the compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClasses of carriers include, but are not limited to binders, buffering agents, coloring agents, diluents, disintegrants, emulsifiers, flavorings, glidants, lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, surfactants, tableting agents, and wetting agents. Some carriers may be listed in more than one class, for example vegetable oil may be used as a lubricant in some formulations and a diluent in others. Exemplary pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sugars, starches, celluloses, powdered tragacanth, malt, gelatin, talc, and vegetable oils. Optional active and/or inactive agents may be included in the pharmaceutical compositions, provided that such agents do not substantially interfere with the activity of the compounds used in the pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions formulated for oral administration are often preferred. These compositions contain between 0.1 and 99 weight % (wt. %) of a 2-fluorothiazole derivative and usually at least about 5 wt. % of a 2-fluorothiazole derivative, particular, a 2-fluorothiazole derivative of formula (II). Some embodiments contain from about 25 wt. % to about 50 wt. % or from about 5 wt. % to about 75 wt. % of the 2-fluorothiazole derivative.\n\n\n \nTreatment Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein are useful for treating mGluR5 mediated disorders in patients. An effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition may be an amount sufficient to (a) prevent an mGluR5 mediated disorder or a symptom of an mGluR5 mediated disorder from occurring in a patient who may be predisposed to an mGluR5 mediated disorder but who has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibit the progression of an mGluR5 mediated disorder; and (c) cause a regression of the mGluR5 mediated disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition described herein will also provide a sufficient concentration of a 2-fluorothiazole derivative when administered to a patient. A sufficient concentration is a concentration of the compound in the patient's body necessary to prevent or combat the disorder. Such an amount may be ascertained experimentally, for example by assaying blood concentration of the compound, or theoretically, by calculating bioavailability. The amount of an active agent sufficient to modulate mGluR5 in vivo may be determined in vitro with a conventional assay for mGluR5 occupancy, which is described below in the examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of treatment include providing certain dosage amounts of a 2-fluorothiazole derivative to a patient. Dosage levels of each compound of from about 0.1 mg to about 140 mg per kilogram of body weight per day are useful in the treatment of the above-indicated conditions (about 0.5 mg to about 7 g per patient per day). The amount of compound that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the patient treated and the particular mode of administration. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of each active compound. In certain embodiments 25 mg to 500 mg, or 25 mg to 200 mg of a compound of Formula II are provided daily to a patient. Frequency of dosage may also vary depending on the compound used and the particular disease treated. However, for treatment of most mGluR5 mediated disorders, a dosage regimen of 4 times daily or less is preferred and a dosage regimen of 1 or 2 times daily is particularly preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nSynthesis of Radiolabeled 2-Fluorothiazole Derivatives\n\n\n \n \n \nThe method of making radiolabeled 2-fluorothiazole derivatives is depicted in Scheme 3, below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHalo precursors (5-9) for radiolabeling were prepared by Sonogashira cross-coupling of 1 with the appropriate haloarenes followed by regioselective halogenation with CuX (X═Cl, Br, I for compounds 5-7, respectively; X═Br for compounds 8 and 9) in the presence of n-butyl nitrite (Schemes 1 and 2). The corresponding fluoro analogs (10-12) were obtained in 25-40% yield by treating the bromides (6, 8 or 9) with KF in DMSO under microwave irradiation at 150 W (10 min, 150° C.). Use of a KF-AgF mixture improved yields to 75%. An aqueous solution (100 μL) of potassium carbonate (0.5 mg) and Kryptofix® 222 (5 mg) was added to aqueous cyclotron-produced [\n18\nF]fluoride ion (150-250 μL), and dried by three cycles of acetonitrile addition evaporation under a nitrogen stream. Each halo precursor (5-9) (about 1 mg) was heated with the generated [\n18\nF]F\n−\n—K\n+\n-Kryptofix® 222 complex for different times and temperatures in MeCN or DMSO (750 μL) under microwave irradiation at 90 W (80 to 150° C.). Radioactive products were purified on a semi-preparative size Luna C18 column being eluted with acetonitrile: aq. 10 mM ammonium formate (60: 40, v/v) at 4.5 mL/min, and then analyzed by coinjection with reference ligand and LC-MS analysis of carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment of 5, 6 or 7 with [\n18\nF]fluoride ion in DMSO under microwave irradiation (5-10 min, 150° C., 90 W) produced [\n18\nF]12 ([\n18\nF]labeled 2-fluoro-4-(phenylethynyl)thiazole) in 19, 16 or 3% decay-corrected radiochemical yield (RCY), respectively. Radiofluorination of 6 at 130° C. in DMSO under argon for 10 min. gave [\n18\nF]12 in much higher RCY (52%). The radiofluorination of 9 under mild conditions (MeCN, 80° C., 30 min) gave \n18\nF-labeled 3-fluoro-5-((2-fluorothiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)benzonitrile (label at 2-fluoro) in only 4% RCY, but under harsher conditions (DMSO, 130° C., 10 min) gave high RCY (86%). Under the latter conditions, [\n18\nF]13 (\n18\nF-labeled (5-((2-fluorothiazol-4-yl) ethynyl)benzonitrile)) was produced from 8 in 37% RCY.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction of 2-halo-substituted 1,3-thiazoles with [\n18\nF]fluoride ion gave the [\n18\nF]2-fluoro analogs in high RCYs.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nIn Vitro Receptor Binding to Rat Brain Membranes\n\n\n \n \n \nThe affinity of test compounds for rat brain membranes is determined by displacement of [\n3\nH]MPEPy binding to rat brain membranes. Whole rat brain, minus cerebellum and brainstem, is homogenized (1:10 w/v) in ice-cold assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl-1.1% saline buffer, pH 7.5). The homogenate is centrifuged at 800×g for 10 min at 4° C., and the resulting pellet is resuspended in buffer (6.25 mg original wet weight per mL) and stored at −70° C. until analysis. Immediately before analysis, membranes are resuspended in assay buffer (0.9% NaCl containing 50 mM Tris-HCl) to give a final assay concentration of 5 mg/800 μL. Each competing ligand (10 mM in EtOH) is added in a volume of 100 μL to give a final concentration in the range of 0.01 nM to 1 mM along with 100 μL of [\n3\nH]MPEPy. The incubation is initiated by adding membranes (800 μL) to constitute a total assay volume of 1 mL and is allowed to proceed for 1 hour at 22° C. The assay is terminated by rapid filtration over Whatman GF/B filters that had been presoaked in poly(ethyleneimine) (0.5%) and then three washes with ice-cold saline (0.9% NaCl; 3 mL). Radioactivity is determined by liquid scintillation counting.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nIn Vitro Binding to Glutamate Receptors\n\n\n \n \n \nThe assay buffer is Standard Binding Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) and the membrane fraction source is transiently or stably transfected cell lines (e.g., HEK293, COS, CHO, NIH3T3)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA solution of the compound to be tested is prepared as a 1-mg/ml stock in the Standard Binding Buffer or DMSO according to its solubility. A similar stock of reference compound (positive control) is also prepared. Eleven dilutions (5× assay concentration) of the test and reference (MTEP) compounds are prepared in Standard Binding Buffer by serial dilution: 0.05 nM, 0.5 nM, 1.5 nM, 5 nM, 15 nM, 50 nM, 150 nM, 500 nM, 1.5 μM, 5 μM, 50 μM (thus, the corresponding assay concentrations span from 10 μM to 10 μM and include semilog points in the range where high-to-moderate affinity ligands compete with radioligand for binding sites).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadioligand ([\n3\nH]MPEP) is diluted to 4.5 nM (five times the assay concentration) in Standard Binding Buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAliquots (50 μL) of radioligand are dispensed into the wells of a 96-well plate containing 100 μl of Standard Binding Buffer. Then, duplicate 50-μL aliquots of the test and reference compound dilutions are added.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, crude membrane fractions of cells expressing recombinant target (prepared from 10-cm plates by harvesting PBS-rinsed monolayers, resuspending and lysing in chilled, hypotonic 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, centrifuging at 20,000×g, decanting the supernatant and storing at −80° C.; typically, one 10-cm plate provides sufficient material for 24 wells) are resuspended in 3 mL of chilled Standard Binding Buffer and homogenized by several passages through a 26 gauge needle, then 50 μL are dispensed into each well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 250-4, reactions are incubated at room temperature and shielded from light (to prevent photolysis of light-sensitive ligands) for 1 hour, then harvested by rapid filtration onto Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters pre-soaked with 0.3% polyethyleneimine using a 96-well Brandel harvester. Four rapid 500-μL washes are performed with chilled Standard Binding Buffer to reduce non-specific binding. Filters are placed in 6-mL scintillation tubes and allowed to dry overnight. The next day, 4 mL of EcoScint scintillation cocktail (National Diagnostics) are added to each tube. The tubes are capped, labeled, and counted by liquid scintillation counting. For higher throughput assays, bound radioactivity is harvested onto 0.3% polyethyleneimine-treated, 96-well filter mats using a 96-well Filtermate harvester. The filter mats are dried, then scintillant is melted onto the filters and the radioactivity retained on the filters is counted in a Microbeta scintillation counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRaw data (dpm) representing total radioligand binding (i.e., specific+non-specific binding) are plotted as a function of the logarithm of the molar concentration of the competitor (i.e., test or reference compound). Non-linear regression of the normalized (i.e., percent radioligand binding compared to that observed in the absence of test or reference compound) raw data is performed in Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software) using the built-in three parameter logistic model describing ligand competition binding to radioligand-labeled sites:\n\n\n \n \n \n \ny\n=bottom+[(top-bottom)/(1+10×-log IC\n50\n)]  (Eqn. 1)\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwhere bottom equals the residual radioligand binding measured in the presence of 10 μM reference compound (i.e., non-specific binding) and top equals the total radioligand binding observed in the absence of competitor.

Ice-cold (4° C.) heparinized saline (100 units/mL; 40 mL) is perfused through the left ventricle of the heart until perfusate, when leaving the opened right atrium, is clear of blood. The brain is excised and placed in ice-cold (4° C.) heparinized saline (5 mL) in an ice-cold glass tube of a tissue homogenizer (model 099C-K54; Glas-Col, Terre Haute, Ind.) and homogenized by three Teflon pestle plunges with a 5-min pause after each plunge. [\n18\nF-labeled] test compound (20 μCi) is added to the brain homogenate (5 mL) and then incubated at 37° C. in a reciprocating-shaker water bath (model 25; Precision Scientific, Chicago, Ill.) at 60 oscillations/min. Aliquots (50 n1) from the incubation mixture are removed at 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min, placed in acetonitrile (300 n1) that had been spiked with test compound, and then mixed. Potassium fluoride solution (0.5 M; 50 μl) is added, and the solution is mixed again. All samples are measured in a gamma counter and then centrifuged at 10,000×g for 1 minute. The supernatant liquids are analyzed by radio-HPLC. The precipitates are then counted in a gamma counter for calculating the recovery of radioactivity into the acetonitrile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a separate experiment, rat brain homogenates are incubated with [\n18\nF-labeled] compound for 1.5 hours, and then they are analyzed simultaneously on two chromatographic systems to separate and identify radiometabolites. One method is based on the use of a Shodex ODP2 HP-4E column (250×4.6 mm, 5 μm; Showa Denko America, Inc., New York, N.Y.). The Shodex column has mixed mode features (size exclusion and polymer-based stationary phase) that allow polar compounds, such as [\n18\nF]fluoride ion, to be retained when acetonitrile predominates in the mobile phase. Thus, the column is equilibrated with acetonitrile/100 mM ammonium formate [80:20 (v/v); pH 4.5] at 0.7 mL/min. All samples are deproteinized with acetonitrile and adjusted to a final acetonitrile composition of 80%. Up to 1 mL of the biological sample is injected onto the Shodex column. Potassium fluoride solution (>0.5 mM; 100 μL) is added to enhance separation of [\n18\nF]fluoride ion from unchanged [\n18\nF]test compound on the Shodex column.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor blood analysis, sample (2 mL) is mixed with \n18\nF-labeled test compound (3.5 μCi) in a polypropylene tube (13×60 mm) and incubated at 37° C., as described above. A 50-μL aliquot of the radioactive blood is removed at 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min and placed in saline (1 ml) and centrifuged (1800×g; 1.5 min). The supernatant plasma saline is separated from the pelleted cells. The cell and plasma saline fractions are mixed first with acetonitrile (300 μL) that had been spiked with test compound and then with potassium fluoride solution (0.5 M; 50 μL). The samples are measured in a gamma counter and centrifuged (10,000×g; 1 min), and the supernatant liquids are injected onto radio-HPLC for analysis. The precipitates are then measured in a gamma counter to calculate recovery of radioactivity into the acetonitrile.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nPositron Emission Tomography\n\n\n \n \n \nANIMAL CARE AND USE. Experiments in rhesus monkeys (\nMacacca mulatto\n) are conducted according to the \nGuide for the Care and Use for Laboratory Animals\n. Rhesus monkeys (10 kg) are initially anesthetized with ketamine (10 mg/kg, i.m.) and then induced with propofol (5 mg/kg, i.v.), intubated, and respired with medical grade air. During the PET scanning sessions, anesthesia is maintained by continuous administration of isoflurane at 1.0-4.0% in oxygen via the endotracheal tube. Body temperature is maintained between 37 and 37.5° C. Electrocardiograph, heart, and respiration rates are also monitored throughout the experiment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPET scans are performed in a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT, Siemens/CPS, Knoxyille, Tenn.). Transmission scans are performed with a Cs point source following injection of 2 to 5 mCi of the PET radioligand. Images are reconstructed with attenuation and scatter correction using a list mode OSEM algorithm, resulting in an image resolution of 2.5 mm fwhm (full width at half maximum). Tomographic images are analyzed with PMOD 2.75 (PMOD Technologies Ltd, Adliswil, Switzerland). For each scan, a static PET image is obtained by summing the dynamic frames acquired during the acquisition. In a baseline experiment, [\n18\nF]test compound (3.99 mCi; specific radioactivity, 1.93 Ci/micromol) is injected intravenously into the monkey (14.7 kg) as a bolus in physiological saline (5 mL) containing ethanol (10%). For a pretreatment experiment on a separate day, MTEP (2-5 mg/kg) in physiological saline containing ethanol (10%) is injected intravenously into the same monkey at 15 min before injection of \n18\nF-labeled test compound (3.82 mCi; specific radioactivity, 2.02 Ci/micromol).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegions of interest are drawn on the coregistered images in striatum (caudate and putamen), thalamus, hippocampus, occipital cortex, cerebellum, and bone (mandible). These regions were transferred onto the dynamic scans to obtain the corresponding time-activity curves. Radioactivity was expressed as standardized uptake value (SUV), which normalizes for injected activity and body weight.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nMRI and Image Fusion\n\n\n \n \n \nAll monkeys have T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (TR/TE/x) 24 ms/3 ms/300), acquired on a 1.5-T GE Horizon Instrument (General Electric Medical Systems, Waukesha, Wis.). PET and NMR images are coregistered with SPM2 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, U.K.).\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nEmergence of Radiometabolites in Monkey Blood In Vivo\n\n\n \n \n \nHeparinized blood samples (1 mL) are drawn at 1 min intervals for 5 min and then at 10, 25, 40, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min after injection of [\n18\nF]test compound (2.2. mCi) into an anesthetized monkey. They are placed immediately on ice to retard ex vivo metabolism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeasured aliquots (by pipetting; about 1 mL) of blood are then centrifuged at 1800×g for 1.5 min and plasma separated. The cellular and the plasma fractions are then counted in a gamma-counter. The distribution of radioactivity is calculated for each sample. The total radioactivity in the plasma and the cells represents the amount in whole blood.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nStability of [\n18\nF]Test Compound in Monkey and Human Whole Blood and Plasma In Vitro\n\n\n \n \n \nIn these experiments, the initial radiochemical purity of \n18\nF-labeled test compound and subsequent measures of stability is determined by reverse phase chromatography on a Novapak C-18 column (100×8 mm; Waters Corp., Milford, Mass.) using a Radial-Pak compression module RCM-11 with a sentry precolumn and a mobile phase of MeOH—H\n2\nO-Et\n3\nN (70:30:0.1) at a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test for the stability of \n18\nFlabeled test compound in monkey whole blood, anticoagulated (EDTA) blood (8 mL) is drawn from an anesthetized monkey. \n18\nF-labeled test compound (15 μCi) is added to whole blood (1.5 mL), which is then sampled (50 μL) at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min. Each sample is added immediately to acetonitrile that has been spiked with test compound. The mixture is then agitated, diluted with water (50 μL), and mixed. The mixture is counted for radioactivity in a gamma-counter and centrifuged at 9400×g for 1 min. The clear supernatant liquid is analyzed with HPLC and the precipitate counted for radioactivity in a gamma-counter. The effect of sodium azide on the stability of [\n18\nF]test compound in whole monkey blood is also assessed. Whole blood (1 mL) is mixed well with a solution (20 μL) of sodium azide (6 mg). [\n18\nF]Test compound is added and the solution incubated at room temperature for 190 min before centrifugation at 1800×g for 4 min. The supernatant plasma is treated with acetonitrile and analyzed with HPLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stability of \n18\nF-labeled-test compound in monkey plasma is assessed as follows. Whole monkey blood (2.0 mL) is centrifuged at 1800×g for 5 min. Supernatant plasma (1.0 mL) is added to \n18\nF-labeled test compound (5 μCi) and the solution incubated at RT for 168 min. A sample is then analyzed by HPLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test the stability of \n18\nF-labeled test compound in whole human blood, \n18\nF-labeled test compound (2 μCi) is added to human whole blood (2.0 mL), incubated at 23° C., and sampled (50 μL) at 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, and 90 min. Each sample is placed in acetonitrile (50 μL) that had been spiked with test compound and mixed well. Then potassium fluoride solution (0.5 M; 50 mL) is added to each sample before mixing again, counting for radioactivity in a c-counter, and centrifugation at 10,000×g for 1 min. Each supernatant liquid is injected onto HPLC for analysis. The stability of \n18\nF-labeled test compound in aqueous solution is also checked. Thus, solutions of \n18\nF-labeled test compound in water alone and in saline (0.9%) containing phosphoric acid (0.15 mM) are prepared and sampled at set times (34, 48, and 159 min for water solution and 54 and 71 min for salt solution) for immediate HPLC analysis.\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nStability of \n18\nF-Lableled]Test Compound in Monkey and Human Brain Homogenates In Vitro\n\n\n \n \n \nMonkey brain tissue (3.34 g), previously stored for 1 year at −70° C., is thawed slowly at room temperature and then homogenized with \n18\nF-labeled test compound (about 100 μCi). The tissue suspension is ice-cooled between each pass of homogenization. Brain homogenate is sampled after incubation at 37° C. in an oscillating water bath at 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman brain tissue (1.76 g), previously stored for a few weeks at −70° C., is thawed slowly at room temperature and then homogenized with ice-cold saline (3 mL). The tissue suspension is ice cooled between each pass of homogenization. \n18\nF-labeled test compound (about 50 μCi) in ethanol-water (1:1 v/v; 450 μL) is slowly mixed into to the cold homogenate. This mixture is incubated at 37° C. in an oscillating water bath and sampled (50 μL) after 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples from incubations of \n18\nF-labeled test compound with monkey or human brain homogenate are added to acetonitrile (700 μL), which has been spiked with test compound and mixed well. Then potassium fluoride solution (0.5 M; 50 μL) is added, and the solution is mixed well again. Each sample is counted in a gamma-counter and centrifuged at 10,000×g for 1 min. The supernatant liquids are analyzed with HPLC. The precipitates are counted in a gamma-counter to enable calculation of the recovery of radioactivity into acetonitrile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes can be made and equivalents can be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention.
