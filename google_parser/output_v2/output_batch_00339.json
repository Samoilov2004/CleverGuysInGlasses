No. 60/293,343, filed May 24, 2001, each of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThe present invention relates generally to improved fusion proteins comprising a tumor necrosis factor receptor moiety and an immunoglobulin moiety. In particular, the present invention relates to improved TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins.\n\n\nREFERENCE TO A SEQUENCE LISTING SUBMITTED AS A TEXT FILE VIA EFS-WEB\n\n\nThe official copy of the sequence listing is submitted concurrently with the specification as a text file via EFS-Web, in compliance with the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), with a file name of 381101seqlist.txt, a creation date of Oct. 23, 2009, and a size of 100 Kb. The sequence listing filed via EFS-Web is part of the specification and is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nCytokines are soluble, small proteins that mediate a variety of biological effects, including the regulation of the growth and differentiation of many cell types (see, for example, Arai et al., \nAnnu. Rev. Biochem. \n59:783 (1990); Mosmann, \nCurr. Opin. Immunol. \n3:311 (1991); Paul and Seder, \nCell \n76:241 (1994)). Proteins that constitute the cytokine group include interleukins, interferons, colony stimulating factors, tumor necrosis factors, and other regulatory molecules. For example, human interleukin-17 is a cytokine which stimulates the expression of interleukin-6, intracellular adhesion molecule 1, interleukin-8, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and prostaglandin E2 expression, and plays a role in the preferential maturation of CD34+ hematopoietic precursors into neutrophils (Yao et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n155:5483 (1995); Fossiez et al., \nJ. Exp. Med. \n183:2593 (1996)).\n\n\nReceptors that bind cytokines are typically composed of one or more integral membrane proteins that bind the cytokine with high affinity and transduce this binding event to the cell through the cytoplasmic portions of the certain receptor subunits.\n\n\nCytokine receptors have been grouped into several classes on the basis of similarities in their extracellular ligand binding domains. For example, the receptor chains responsible for binding and/or transducing the effect of interferons are members of the type II cytokine receptor family, based upon a characteristic 200 residue extracellular domain.\n\n\nCellular interactions, which occur during an immune response, are regulated by members of several families of cell surface receptors, including the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family. The TNFR family consists of a number of integral membrane glycoprotein receptors many of which, in conjunction with their respective ligands, regulate interactions between different hematopoietic cell lineages (see, for example, Cosman, \nStem Cells \n12:440 (1994); Wajant et al., \nCytokine Growth Factor Rev. \n10:15 (1999); Yeh et al., \nImmunol. Rev. \n169:283 (1999); Idriss and Naismith, \nMicrosc. Res. Tech. \n50:184 (2000)).\n\n\nOne such receptor is TACI, transmembrane activator and CAML-interactor (von Bülow and Bram, \nScience \n228:138 (1997); Bram and von Bülow, U.S. Pat. No. 5,969,102 (1999)). TACI is a membrane bound receptor, which has an extracellular domain containing two cysteine-rich pseudo-repeats, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain that interacts with CAML (calcium-modulator and cyclophilin ligand), an integral membrane protein located at intracellular vesicles which is a co-inducer of NF-AT activation when overexpressed in Jurkat cells. TACI is associated with B cells and a subset of T cells. Nucleotide sequences that encode TACI and its corresponding amino acid sequence are provided herein as SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2, respectively\n\n\nThe TACI receptor binds two members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family. One ligand is variously designated as ZTNF4, “BAFF,” “neutrokine-α, ” “BLyS,” “TALL-1,” and “THANK” (Yu et al., international publication No. WO98/18921 (1998), Moore et al., \nScience \n285:269 (1999); Mukhopadhyay et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n274:15978 (1999); Schneider et al., \nJ. Exp. Med. \n189:1747 (1999); Shu et al., \nJ. Leukoc. Biol. \n65:680 (1999)). The amino acid sequence of ZTNF4 is provided as SEQ ID NO:3. The other ligand has been designated as “ZTNF2,” “APRIL” and “TNRF death ligand-1” (Hahne et al., \nJ. Exp. Med. \n188:1185 (1998); Kelly et al., \nCancer Res. \n60:1021 (2000)). The amino acid sequence of ZTNF2 is provided as SEQ ID NO:4. Both ligands are also bound by the B-cell maturation receptor (BCMA) (Gross et al., \nNature \n404:995 (2000)). The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of BCMA are provided as SEQ ID NO:26 and SEQ ID NO:27, respectively.\n\n\nThe demonstrated in vivo activities of tumor necrosis factor receptors illustrate the clinical potential of soluble forms of the receptor. Soluble forms of the TACI receptor have been generated as immunoglobulin fusion proteins. Initial versions resulted in low-expressing, heterogeneous protein. The heterogeneity was observed at the TACI amino terminus, at the Fc carboxyl terminus, and in the TACI stalk region. A need therefore exists for pharmaceutically useful TACI receptor compositions.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides improved TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins suitable as therapeutic compounds.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n shows the amino acid sequence of human TACI (SEQ ID NO:2).

The TACI-Fc fusion proteins had TACI moieties that lacked the first 29 amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2. One of the fusion proteins had a TACI moiety with an intact stalk region (TACI (d1-29)-Fc5), whereas three of the TACI-Fc fusion proteins had TACI moieties with various deletions in the stalk region (TACI (d1-29, d107-154)-Fc5; TACI (d1-29, d111-154)-Fc5; TACI (d1-29, d120-154)-Fc5). Experimental details are described in Example 4.\n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n1. Overview\n\n\nAs described below, the present invention provides transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand-interactor (TACI)-immunoglobulin fusion proteins, and methods for using TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins. For example, the present invention provides methods for inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells, comprising administering to the tumor cells a composition that comprises a TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein. Such a composition can be administered to cells cultured in vitro. Alternatively, the composition can be a pharmaceutical composition that comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein, and the pharmaceutical composition can be administered to a subject, which has a tumor. The subject may be a mammalian subject. Administration of the pharmaceutical composition can inhibit, for example, the proliferation of B lymphocytes in a mammalian subject.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides methods for inhibiting ZTNF4 activity in a mammal, comprising administering to the mammal a composition that comprises a TACI-immunoglobulin. The ZTNF4 activity can be associated with various diseases and disorders. For example, a pharmaceutical composition that comprises a TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein can be used to treat an autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis. Alternatively, a pharmaceutical composition that comprises a TACI-immunoglobulin can be used to treat a disorder such as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and end stage renal failure. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a TACI-immunoglobulin can also be used to treat renal disease, such as glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, nephritis, amyloidosis, and pyelonephritis, or a disorder, such as neoplasm, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease, and light chain gammopathy. In certain cases, the ZTNF4 activity can be associated with T cells. A pharmaceutical composition that comprises a TACI-immunoglobulin can also be used to treat a disease or disorder associated with immunosuppression, graft rejection, graft versus host disease, and inflammation. For example, a pharmaceutical composition that comprises a TACI-immunoglobulin can be used to decrease inflammation, and to treat disorders such as joint pain, swelling, anemia, and septic shock.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides methods for reducing circulating blood levels of ZTNF4 in a mammalian subject, comprising administering to the mammalian subject a pharmaceutical composition that comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein, wherein administration of the pharmaceutical composition reduces the circulating level of ZTNF4 in the blood of the mammalian subject. As an illustration, the administration of such a pharmaceutical composition can reduce circulating blood levels of ZTNF4 by at least 10%, by at least 20%, by at least 10 to 60%, by at least 20 to 50%, or by at least 30 to 40%, compared with the blood level of ZTNF4 prior to the administration of the pharmaceutical composition. Those of skill in the art can measure circulating levels of ZTNF4. Illustrative methods are described in Example 4 and Example 5.\n\n\nAs described below, illustrative TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins comprise:\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) a TACI receptor moiety that consists of a fragment of a polypeptide that has the amino acid sequence of \namino acid residues\n 30 to 154 of SEQ ID NO:2, wherein the TACI receptor moiety comprises at least one of (i) amino acid residues 34 to 66 of SEQ ID NO:2, and (ii) amino acid residues 71 to 104 of SEQ ID NO:2, and wherein the TACI receptor moiety binds at least one of ZTNF2 or ZTNF4, and\n \n(b) an immunoglobulin moiety comprising a constant region of an immunoglobulin.\n\n\nSuitable TACI receptor moieties include: polypeptides that comprise amino acid residues 34 to 66 of SEQ ID NO:2, and amino acid residues 71 to 104 of SEQ ID NO:2; polypeptides that comprise amino acid residues 34 to 104 of SEQ ID NO:2; polypeptides that comprise the amino acid sequence of \namino acid residues\n 30 to 110 of SEQ ID NO:2; and polypeptides that have an amino acid sequence consisting of \namino acid residues\n 30 to 110 of SEQ ID NO:2.\n\n \n \n \n\n\nThe immunoglobulin moiety of a TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein can comprise a heavy chain constant region, such as a human heavy chain constant region. An IgG1 heavy chain constant region is one example of a suitable heavy chain constant region. An illustrative IgG1 heavy chain constant region is an IgG1 Fc fragment that comprises C\nH2\n, and C\nH3 \ndomains. The IgG1 Fc fragment can be a wild-type IgG1 Fc fragment or a mutated IgG1 Fc fragment, such as the Fc fragment comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:33. One exemplary TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein is a protein that has an amino acid sequence comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:54.\n\n\nThe TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins described herein can be multimers, such as dimers.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides nucleic acid molecules that encode a TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein. An illustrative nucleotide sequence that encodes a TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein is provided by SEQ ID NO:53.\n\n\nThe present invention also includes TACI soluble receptors that consist of a fragment of a polypeptide that has the amino acid sequence of \namino acid residues\n 30 to 154 of SEQ ID NO:2, wherein the TACI soluble receptor comprises at least one of (i) amino acid residues 34 to 66 of SEQ ID NO:2, and (ii) amino acid residues 71 to 104 of SEQ ID NO:2, and wherein the TACI soluble receptor binds at least one of ZTNF2 or ZTNF4. Additional TACI soluble receptors are described herein as suitable TACI receptor moieties for TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins. Moreover, TACI soluble receptors can be used in methods described for TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins.\n\n\nThese and other aspects of the invention will become evident upon reference to the following detailed description and drawings. In addition, various references are identified below and are incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n2. Definitions\n\n\nIn the description that follows, a number of terms are used extensively. The following definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the invention.\n\n\nAs used herein, “nucleic acid” or “nucleic acid molecule” refers to polynucleotides, such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA), oligonucleotides, fragments generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and fragments generated by any of ligation, scission, endonuclease action, and exonuclease action. Nucleic acid molecules can be composed of monomers that are naturally-occurring nucleotides (such as DNA and RNA), or analogs of naturally-occurring nucleotides (e.g., α-enantiomeric forms of naturally-occurring nucleotides), or a combination of both. Modified nucleotides can have alterations in sugar moieties and/or in pyrimidine or purine base moieties. Sugar modifications include, for example, replacement of one or more hydroxyl groups with halogens, alkyl groups, amines, and azido groups, or sugars can be functionalized as ethers or esters. Moreover, the entire sugar moiety can be replaced with sterically and electronically similar structures, such as aza-sugars and carbocyclic sugar analogs. Examples of modifications in a base moiety include alkylated purines and pyrimidines, acylated purines or pyrimidines, or other well-known heterocyclic substitutes. Nucleic acid monomers can be linked by phosphodiester bonds or analogs of such linkages. Analogs of phosphodiester linkages include phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phosphoranilidate, phosphoramidate, and the like. The term “nucleic acid molecule” also includes so-called “peptide nucleic acids,” which comprise naturally-occurring or modified nucleic acid bases attached to a polyamide backbone. Nucleic acids can be either single stranded or double stranded.\n\n\nThe term “complement of a nucleic acid molecule” refers to a nucleic acid molecule having a complementary nucleotide sequence and reverse orientation as compared to a reference nucleotide sequence. For example, the sequence 5′ ATGCACGGG 3′ (SEQ ID NO:57) is complementary to 5′ CCCGTGCAT 3′ (SEQ ID NO:58).\n\n\nThe term “contig” denotes a nucleic acid molecule that has a contiguous stretch of identical or complementary sequence to another nucleic acid molecule. Contiguous sequences are said to “overlap” a given stretch of a nucleic acid molecule either in their entirety or along a partial stretch of the nucleic acid molecule. The term “degenerate nucleotide sequence” denotes a sequence of nucleotides that includes one or more degenerate codons as compared to a reference nucleic acid molecule that encodes a polypeptide. Degenerate codons contain different triplets of nucleotides, but encode the same amino acid residue (i.e., GAU and GAC triplets each encode Asp).\n\n\nThe term “structural gene” refers to a nucleic acid molecule that is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated into a sequence of amino acids characteristic of a specific polypeptide.\n\n\nAn “isolated nucleic acid molecule” is a nucleic acid molecule that is not integrated in the genomic DNA of an organism. For example, a DNA molecule that encodes a growth factor that has been separated from the genomic DNA of a cell is an isolated DNA molecule. Another example of an isolated nucleic acid molecule is a chemically-synthesized nucleic acid molecule that is not integrated in the genome of an organism. A nucleic acid molecule that has been isolated from a particular species is smaller than the complete DNA molecule of a chromosome from that species.\n\n\nA “nucleic acid molecule construct” is a nucleic acid molecule, either single- or double-stranded, that has been modified through human intervention to contain segments of nucleic acid combined and juxtaposed in an arrangement not existing in nature.\n\n\n“Linear DNA” denotes non-circular DNA molecules having free 5′ and 3′ ends. Linear DNA can be prepared from closed circular DNA molecules, such as plasmids, by enzymatic digestion or physical disruption.\n\n\n“Complementary DNA (cDNA)” is a single-stranded DNA molecule that is formed from an mRNA template by the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Typically, a primer complementary to portions of mRNA is employed for the initiation of reverse transcription. Those skilled in the art also use the term “cDNA” to refer to a double-stranded DNA molecule consisting of such a single-stranded DNA molecule and its complementary DNA strand. The term “cDNA” also refers to a clone of a cDNA molecule synthesized from an RNA template.\n\n\nA “promoter” is a nucleotide sequence that directs the transcription of a structural gene. Typically, a promoter is located in the 5′ non-coding region of a gene, proximal to the transcriptional start site of a structural gene. Sequence elements within promoters that function in the initiation of transcription are often characterized by consensus nucleotide sequences. These promoter elements include RNA polymerase binding sites, TATA sequences, CAAT sequences, differentiation-specific elements (DSEs; McGehee et al., \nMol. Endocrinol. \n7:551 (1993)), cyclic AMP response elements (CREs), serum response elements (SREs; Treisman, \nSeminars in Cancer Biol. \n1:47 (1990)), glucocorticoid response elements (GREs), and binding sites for other transcription factors, such as CRE/ATF (O'Reilly et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n267:19938 (1992)), AP2 (Ye et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n269:25728 (1994)), SP1, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB; Loeken, \nGene Expr. \n3:253 (1993)) and octamer factors (see, in general, Watson et al., eds., \nMolecular Biology of the Gene, \n4th ed. (The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc. 1987), and Lemaigre and Rousseau, \nBiochem. J. \n303:1 (1994)). If a promoter is an inducible promoter, then the rate of transcription increases in response to an inducing agent. In contrast, the rate of transcription is not regulated by an inducing agent if the promoter is a constitutive promoter. Repressible promoters are also known.\n\n\nA “core promoter” contains essential nucleotide sequences for promoter function, including the TATA box and start of transcription. By this definition, a core promoter may or may not have detectable activity in the absence of specific sequences that may enhance the activity or confer tissue specific activity.\n\n\nA “regulatory element” is a nucleotide sequence that modulates the activity of a core promoter. For example, a regulatory element may contain a nucleotide sequence that binds with cellular factors enabling transcription exclusively or preferentially in particular cells, tissues, or organelles. These types of regulatory elements are normally associated with genes that are expressed in a “cell-specific,” “tissue-specific,” or “organelle-specific” manner.\n\n\nAn “enhancer” is a type of regulatory element that can increase the efficiency of transcription, regardless of the distance or orientation of the enhancer relative to the start site of transcription.\n\n\n“Heterologous DNA” refers to a DNA molecule, or a population of DNA molecules, that does not exist naturally within a given host cell. DNA molecules heterologous to a particular host cell may contain DNA derived from the host cell species (i.e., endogenous DNA) so long as that host DNA is combined with non-host DNA (i.e., exogenous DNA). For example, a DNA molecule containing a non-host DNA segment encoding a polypeptide operably linked to a host DNA segment comprising a transcription promoter is considered to be a heterologous DNA molecule. Conversely, a heterologous DNA molecule can comprise an endogenous gene operably linked with an exogenous promoter. As another illustration, a DNA molecule comprising a gene derived from a wild-type cell is considered to be heterologous DNA if that DNA molecule is introduced into a mutant cell that lacks the wild-type gene.\n\n\nA “polypeptide” is a polymer of amino acid residues joined by peptide bonds, whether produced naturally or synthetically. Polypeptides of less than about 10 amino acid residues are commonly referred to as “peptides.”\n\n\nA “protein” is a macromolecule comprising one or more polypeptide chains. A protein may also comprise non-peptidic components, such as carbohydrate groups.\n\n\nCarbohydrates and other non-peptidic substituents may be added to a protein by the cell in which the protein is produced, and will vary with the type of cell. Proteins are defined herein in terms of their amino acid backbone structures; substituents such as carbohydrate groups are generally not specified, but may be present nonetheless.\n\n\nA peptide or polypeptide encoded by a non-host DNA molecule is a “heterologous” peptide or polypeptide.\n\n\nAn “integrated genetic element” is a segment of DNA that has been incorporated into a chromosome of a host cell after that element is introduced into the cell through human manipulation. Within the present invention, integrated genetic elements are most commonly derived from linearized plasmids that are introduced into the cells by electroporation or other techniques. Integrated genetic elements are passed from the original host cell to its progeny.\n\n\nA “cloning vector” is a nucleic acid molecule, such as a plasmid, cosmid, or bacteriophage, which has the capability of replicating autonomously in a host cell. Cloning vectors typically contain one or a small number of restriction endonuclease recognition sites that allow insertion of a nucleic acid molecule in a determinable fashion without loss of an essential biological function of the vector, as well as nucleotide sequences encoding a marker gene that is suitable for use in the identification and selection of cells transformed with the cloning vector. Marker genes typically include genes that provide tetracycline resistance or ampicillin resistance.\n\n\nAn “expression vector” is a nucleic acid molecule encoding a gene that is expressed in a host cell. Typically, an expression vector comprises a transcription promoter, a gene, and a transcription terminator. Gene expression is usually placed under the control of a promoter, and such a gene is said to be “operably linked to” the promoter. Similarly, a regulatory element and a core promoter are operably linked if the regulatory element modulates the activity of the core promoter.\n\n\nA “recombinant host” is a cell that contains a heterologous nucleic acid molecule, such as a cloning vector or expression vector. In the present context, an example of a recombinant host is a cell that produces a TACI-Fc fusion protein from an expression vector.\n\n\n“Integrative transformants” are recombinant host cells, in which heterologous DNA has become integrated into the genomic DNA of the cells.\n\n\nA “fusion protein” is a hybrid protein expressed by a nucleic acid molecule comprising nucleotide sequences of at least two genes. For example, a TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein comprises a TACI receptor moiety and an immunoglobulin moiety. As used herein, a “TACI receptor moiety” is a portion of the extracellular domain of the TACI receptor that binds at least one of ZTNF2 or ZTNF4. The phrase an “immunoglobulin moiety” refers to a polypeptide that comprises a constant region of an immunoglobulin. For example, the immunoglobulin moiety can comprise a heavy chain constant region. The term “TACI-Fc” fusion protein refers to a TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein in which the immunoglobulin moiety comprises immunoglobulin heavy chain constant regions, C\nH2 \nand C\nH3\n.\n\n\nThe term “receptor” denotes a cell-associated protein that binds to a bioactive molecule termed a “ligand.” This interaction mediates the effect of the ligand on the cell. In the context of TACI receptor binding, the phrase “specifically binds” or “specific binding” refers to the ability of the ligand to competitively bind with the receptor. For example, ZTNF4 specifically binds with the TACI receptor, and this can be shown by observing competition for the TACI receptor between detectably labeled ZTNF4 and unlabeled ZTNF4.\n\n\nReceptors can be membrane bound, cytosolic or nuclear; monomeric (e.g., thyroid stimulating hormone receptor, beta-adrenergic receptor) or multimeric (e.g., PDGF receptor, growth hormone receptor, IL-3 receptor, GM-CSF receptor, G-CSF receptor, erythropoietin receptor and IL-6 receptor). Membrane-bound receptors are characterized by a multi-domain structure comprising an extracellular ligand-binding domain and an intracellular effector domain that is typically involved in signal transduction. In certain membrane-bound receptors, the extracellular ligand-binding domain and the intracellular effector domain are located in separate polypeptides that comprise the complete functional receptor.\n\n\nIn general, the binding of ligand to receptor results in a conformational change in the receptor that causes an interaction between the effector domain and other molecule(s) in the cell, which in turn leads to an alteration in the metabolism of the cell. Metabolic events that are often linked to receptor-ligand interactions include gene transcription, phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, increases in cyclic AMP production, mobilization of cellular calcium, mobilization of membrane lipids, cell adhesion, hydrolysis of inositol lipids and hydrolysis of phospholipids.\n\n\nThe term “secretory signal sequence” denotes a DNA sequence that encodes a peptide (a “secretory peptide”) that, as a component of a larger polypeptide, directs the larger polypeptide through a secretory pathway of a cell in which it is synthesized. The larger polypeptide is commonly cleaved to remove the secretory peptide during transit through the secretory pathway.\n\n\nAn “isolated polypeptide” is a polypeptide that is essentially free from contaminating cellular components, such as carbohydrate, lipid, or other proteinaceous impurities associated with the polypeptide in nature. Typically, a preparation of isolated polypeptide contains the polypeptide in a highly purified form, i.e., at least about 80% pure, at least about 90% pure, at least about 95% pure, greater than 95% pure, or greater than 99% pure. One way to show that a particular protein preparation contains an isolated polypeptide is by the appearance of a single band following sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the protein preparation and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the gel. However, the term “isolated” does not exclude the presence of the same polypeptide in alternative physical forms, such as dimers or alternatively glycosylated or derivatized forms.\n\n\nThe terms “amino-terminal” and “carboxyl-terminal” are used herein to denote positions within polypeptides. Where the context allows, these terms are used with reference to a particular sequence or portion of a polypeptide to denote proximity or relative position. For example, a certain sequence positioned carboxyl-terminal to a reference sequence within a polypeptide is located proximal to the carboxyl terminus of the reference sequence, but is not necessarily at the carboxyl terminus of the complete polypeptide.\n\n\nThe term “expression” refers to the biosynthesis of a gene product. For example, in the case of a structural gene, expression involves transcription of the structural gene into mRNA and the translation of mRNA into one or more polypeptides.\n\n\nThe term “splice variant” is used herein to denote alternative forms of RNA transcribed from a gene. Splice variation arises naturally through use of alternative splicing sites within a transcribed RNA molecule, or less commonly between separately transcribed RNA molecules, and may result in several mRNAs transcribed from the same gene. Splice variants may encode polypeptides having altered amino acid sequence. The term splice variant is also used herein to denote a polypeptide encoded by a splice variant of an mRNA transcribed from a gene.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “immunomodulator” includes cytokines, stem cell growth factors, lymphotoxins, co-stimulatory molecules, hematopoietic factors, and synthetic analogs of these molecules.\n\n\nThe term “complement/anti-complement pair” denotes non-identical moieties that form a non-covalently associated, stable pair under appropriate conditions. For instance, biotin and avidin (or streptavidin) are prototypical members of a complement/anti-complement pair. Other exemplary complement/anti-complement pairs include receptor/ligand pairs, antibody/antigen (or hapten or epitope) pairs, sense/antisense polynucleotide pairs, and the like. Where subsequent dissociation of the complement/anti-complement pair is desirable, the complement/anti-complement pair preferably has a binding affinity less than 10\n9 \nM\n−1\n.\n\n\nAn “antibody fragment” is a portion of an antibody such as F(ab′)\n2\n, F(ab)\n2\n, Fab′, Fab, and the like. Regardless of structure, an antibody fragment binds with the same antigen that is recognized by the intact antibody.\n\n\nThe term “antibody fragment” also includes a synthetic or a genetically engineered polypeptide that binds to a specific antigen, such as polypeptides consisting of the light chain variable region, “Fv” fragments consisting of the variable regions of the heavy and light chains, recombinant single chain polypeptide molecules in which light and heavy variable regions are connected by a peptide linker (“scFv proteins”), and minimal recognition units consisting of the amino acid residues that mimic the hypervariable region.\n\n\nA “chimeric antibody” is a recombinant protein that contains the variable domains and complementary determining regions derived from a rodent antibody, while the remainder of the antibody molecule is derived from a human antibody.\n\n\n“Humanized antibodies” are recombinant proteins in which murine complementarity determining regions of a monoclonal antibody have been transferred from heavy and light variable chains of the murine immunoglobulin into a human variable domain.\n\n\nAs used herein, a “therapeutic agent” is a molecule or atom, which is conjugated to an antibody moiety to produce a conjugate, which is useful for therapy. Examples of therapeutic agents include drugs, toxins, immunomodulators, chelators, boron compounds, photoactive agents or dyes, and radioisotopes.\n\n\nA “detectable label” is a molecule or atom, which can be conjugated to an antibody moiety to produce a molecule useful for diagnosis. Examples of detectable labels include chelators, photoactive agents, radioisotopes, fluorescent agents, paramagnetic ions, or other marker moieties.\n\n\nThe term “affinity tag” is used herein to denote a polypeptide segment that can be attached to a second polypeptide to provide for purification or detection of the second polypeptide or provide sites for attachment of the second polypeptide to a substrate. In principal, any peptide or protein for which an antibody or other specific binding agent is available can be used as an affinity tag. Affinity tags include a polyhistidine tract, protein A (Nilsson et al., \nEMBO J. \n4:1075 (1985); Nilsson et al., \nMethods Enzymol. \n198:3 (1991)), glutathione S transferase (Smith and Johnson, \nGene \n67:31 (1988)), Glu-Glu affinity tag (Grussenmeyer et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n82:7952 (1985)), substance P, FLAG peptide (Hopp et al., \nBiotechnology \n6:1204 (1988)), streptavidin binding peptide, or other antigenic epitope or binding domain. See, in general, Ford et al., \nProtein Expression and Purification \n2:95 (1991). DNA molecules encoding affinity tags are available from commercial suppliers (e.g., Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.).\n\n\nA “naked antibody” is an entire antibody, as opposed to an antibody fragment, which is not conjugated with a therapeutic agent. Naked antibodies include both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, as well as certain recombinant antibodies, such as chimeric and humanized antibodies.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “antibody component” includes both an entire antibody and an antibody fragment.\n\n\nAn “immunoconjugate” is a conjugate of an antibody component with a therapeutic agent or a detectable label.\n\n\nA “target polypeptide” or a “target peptide” is an amino acid sequence that comprises at least one epitope, and that is expressed on a target cell, such as a tumor cell, or a cell that carries an infectious agent antigen. T cells recognize peptide epitopes presented by a major histocompatibility complex molecule to a target polypeptide or target peptide and typically lyse the target cell or recruit other immune cells to the site of the target cell, thereby killing the target cell.\n\n\nAn “antigenic peptide” is a peptide, which will bind a major histocompatibility complex molecule to form an MHC-peptide complex, which is recognized by a T cell, thereby inducing a cytotoxic lymphocyte response upon presentation to the T cell. Thus, antigenic peptides are capable of binding to an appropriate major histocompatibility complex molecule and inducing a cytotoxic T cells response, such as cell lysis or specific cytokine release against the target cell, which binds or expresses the antigen. The antigenic peptide can be bound in the context of a class I or class II major histocompatibility complex molecule, on an antigen presenting cell or on a target cell.\n\n\nIn eukaryotes, RNA polymerase II catalyzes the transcription of a structural gene to produce mRNA. A nucleic acid molecule can be designed to contain an RNA polymerase II template in which the RNA transcript has a sequence that is complementary to that of a specific mRNA. The RNA transcript is termed an “anti-sense RNA” and a nucleic acid molecule that encodes the anti-sense RNA is termed an “anti-sense gene.” Anti-sense RNA molecules are capable of binding to mRNA molecules, resulting in an inhibition of mRNA translation.\n\n\nDue to the imprecision of standard analytical methods, molecular weights and lengths of polymers are understood to be approximate values. When such a value is expressed as “about” X or “approximately” X, the stated value of X will be understood to be accurate to ±10%.\n\n\n3. Production of Nucleic Acid Molecules Encoding TACI-Immunoglobulin Proteins\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n provides the predicted amino acid sequence of human TACI (von Billow and Bram, \nScience \n278:138 (1997)). The TACI polypeptide contains the following predicted elements: (a) two cysteine-rich pseudo-repeat structures characteristic of tumor necrosis factor ligand binding domains, (b) a 62 amino acid “stalk region,” which resides between the ligand binding domains and the transmembrane domain, (c) a 20 amino acid transmembrane domain, and (d) a 127 amino acid intracellular domain. The amino acid sequence does not contain a predicted hydrophobic amino terminal signal sequence.\n\n\nIn order to create a soluble form of human TACI for use as an inhibitor of the native ligand:native receptor interaction, a TACI extracellular domain-human immunoglobulin Fc fusion protein was generated. The available human TACI sequence was used as the starting point for designing the fusion protein molecule (von Billow and Bram, \nScience \n278:138 (1997)). This initial construct, designated as\n\n\n“TACI-Fc4,” included amino acid residues 1 through 154 of the TACI polypeptide, and a modified human Fc region, described below. The fusion point of residue 154 was chosen in order to include as much of the stalk region of TACI as possible while not including any potential portion of the predicted transmembrane domain.\n\n\nSince native TACI polypeptide does not contain an amino terminal signal sequence, an amino terminal signal sequence was added to TACI in order to generate a secreted form of the TACI-Fc fusion protein. The signal sequence was a modified pre-pro sequence from human tissue plasminogen activator. The modifications were included to enhance signal peptidase cleavage and furin protease-specific processing and for that reason this sequence has been referred to as the “optimized tPA (otPA) leader.” The otPA sequence (SEQ ID NO:25) is illustrated below; modified amino acid residues are shaded. The recombinant TACI-Fc fusion protein coding sequence was inserted into an expression vector, which was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransfected Chinese hamster ovary cells produced the TACI-Fc4 protein at a low level of about 0.3 pg/cell/day. Western blot analysis of TACI-Fc protein with goat anti-human IgG Fc antisera revealed two bands, one band was smaller than the expected size of approximately 48 kDa. Amino acid sequence analysis of purified proteins revealed that the smaller band reflected cleavage of TACI fusion proteins at various sites within the TACI stalk region. With reference to SEQ ID NO:2, the major termini were found at amino acid residues 118 and 123, although, proteins were also cleaved at amino acid positions 110, 139, and 141.\n\n\nIn addition to heterogeneity caused by cleavage in the stalk region, heterogeneity was also observed at the amino and carboxyl termini. With reference to SEQ ID NO:2, the major amino termini were found at \namino acid residues\n 1, 10, and 13. Differences in the carboxyl terminus reflect the natural heterogeneity of recombinant immunoglobulins and immunoglobulin fusion proteins, which includes the incomplete removal of the carboxyl-terminally-encoded lysine residue. Another source of heterogeneity was found in the variable nature of the carbohydrate structure attached to the Fc encoded immunoglobulin C\nH2 \ndomain.\n\n\nNew versions of TACI-Fc were generated to address the observed heterogeneity. Constructs were designed that included at least one of the following variations in the TACI moiety: (1) portions of the TACI stalk region were deleted, (2) a portion of the TACI stalk region was replaced with a portion of the BCMA stalk region, (3) the arginine residue at position 119 was mutated to eliminate a potential furin cleavage site, (4) the glutamine residue at position 121 was mutated to eliminate a potential furin cleavage site, (5) the arginine residue at position 122 was mutated to eliminate a potential furin cleavage site, (6) amino acid residue at positions 123 and 142 were mutated to amino acid residues found in corresponding positions of murine TACI, (7) the human otPA signal sequence was replaced with a human heavy chain variable region signal sequence, (8) the valine residue at position 29 was mutated to methionine, and the otPA signal sequence was joined in an amino terminal position to this residue, and (9) the otPA signal sequence was joined in an amino terminal location to the alanine residue at \nposition\n 30.\n\n\nModifications were also introduced in the immunoglobulin moiety. Five classes of immunoglobulin, IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD, and IgE, have been identified in higher vertebrates. IgG, IgD, and IgE proteins are characteristically disulfide linked heterotetramers consisting of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. Typically, IgM is found as a pentamer of a tetramer, whereas IgA occurs as a dimer of a tetramer. IgG comprises the major class as it normally exists as the second most abundant protein found in plasma. In humans, IgG consists of four subclasses, designated IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. As shown in \nFIG. 2\n, each immunoglobulin heavy chain possesses a constant region that consists of constant region protein domains (C\nH1\n, hinge, C\nH2\n, and C\nH3\n) that are invariant for a given subclass. The heavy chain constant regions of the IgG class are identified with the Greek symbol γ. For example, immunoglobulins of the IgG1 subclass contain a γ1 heavy chain constant region.\n\n\nThe Fc fragment, or Fc domain, consists of the disulfide linked heavy chain hinge regions, C\nH2\n, and C\nH3 \ndomains. In immunoglobulin fusion proteins, Fc domains of the IgG1 subclass are often used as the immunoglobulin moiety, because IgG1 has the longest serum half-life of any of the serum proteins. Lengthy serum half-life can be a desirable protein characteristic for animal studies and potential human therapeutic use. In addition, the IgG1 subclass possesses the strongest ability to carry out antibody mediated effector functions. The primary effector function that may be most useful in an immunoglobulin fusion protein is the ability for an IgG1 antibody to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. On the other hand, this could be an undesirable function for a fusion protein that functions primarily as an antagonist. Several of the specific amino acid residues that are important for antibody constant region-mediated activity in the IgG1 subclass have been identified. Inclusion or exclusion of these specific amino acids therefore allows for inclusion or exclusion of specific immunoglobulin constant region-mediated activity.\n\n\nSix versions of a modified human IgG1 Fc were generated for creating Fc fusion proteins. Fc-488 was designed for convenient cloning of a fusion protein containing the human γ1 Fc region, and it was constructed using the wild-type human immunoglobulin γ1 constant region as a template. Concern about potential deleterious effects due to an unpaired cysteine residue led to the decision to replace the cysteine (amino acid residue 24 of SEQ ID NO:6) that normally disulfide bonds with the immunoglobulin light chain constant region with a serine residue. An additional change was introduced at the codon encoding EU index position 218 (amino acid residue 22 of SEQ ID NO:6) to introduce a BglII restriction enzyme recognition site for ease of future DNA manipulations. These changes were introduced into the PCR product encoded on the PCR primers. Due to the location of the BglII site and in order to complete the Fc hinge region, codons for EU index positions 216 and 217 (\namino acid residues\n 20 and 21 of SEQ ID NO:6) were incorporated in the fusion protein partner sequences. Fc4, Fc5, and Fc6 contain mutations to reduce effector functions mediated by the Fc by reducing FcγRI binding and complement C1q binding. Fc4 contains the same amino acid substitutions that were introduced into Fc-488. Additional amino acid substitutions were introduced to reduce potential Fc mediated effector functions. Specifically, three amino acid substitutions were introduced to reduce FcγRI binding. These are the substitutions at EU index positions 234, 235, and 237 (amino acid residues 38, 39, and 41 of SEQ ID NO:6). Substitutions at these positions have been shown to reduce binding to FcγRI (Duncan et al., \nNature \n332:563 (1988)). These amino acid substitutions may also reduce FcγRIIa binding, as well as FcγRIII binding (Sondermann et al., \nNature \n406:267 (2000); Wines et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n164:5313 (2000)).\n\n\nSeveral groups have described the relevance of EU index positions 330 and 331 (amino acid residues 134 and 135 of SEQ ID NO:6) in complement C1q binding and subsequent complement fixation (Canfield and Morrison, \nJ. Exp. Med. \n173:1483 (1991); Tao et al., \nJ. Exp. Med. \n178:661 (1993)). Amino acid substitutions at these positions were introduced in Fc4 to reduce complement fixation. The C\nH3 \ndomain of Fc4 is identical to that found in the corresponding wild-type polypeptide, except for the stop codon, which was changed from TGA to TAA to eliminate a potential dam methylation site when the cloned DNA is grown in dam plus strains of \nE. coli. \n \n\n\nIn Fc5, the arginine residue at \nEU index position\n 218 was mutated back to a lysine, because the BglIII cloning scheme was not used in fusion proteins containing this particular Fc. The remainder of the Fc5 sequence matches the above description for Fc4.\n\n\nFc6 is identical to Fc5 except that the carboxyl terminal lysine codon has been eliminated. The C-terminal lysine of mature immunoglobulins is often removed from mature immunoglobulins post-translationally prior to secretion from B-cells, or removed during serum circulation. Consequently, the C-terminal lysine residue is typically not found on circulating antibodies. As in Fc4 and Fc5 above, the stop codon in the Fc6 sequence was changed to TAA.\n\n\nFc7 is identical to the wild-type γ1 Fc except for an amino acid substitution at \nEU index position\n 297 located in the C\nH2 \ndomain. EU index position Asn-297 (amino acid residue 101 of SEQ ID NO:6) is a site of N-linked carbohydrate attachment. N-linked carbohydrate introduces a potential source of variability in a recombinantly expressed protein due to potential batch-to-batch variations in the carbohydrate structure. In an attempt to eliminate this potential variability, Asn-297 was mutated to a glutamine residue to prevent the attachment of N-linked carbohydrate at that residue position. The carbohydrate at \nresidue\n 297 is also involved in Fc binding to the FcγRIII (Sondermann et al., \nNature \n406:267 (2000)). Therefore, removal of the carbohydrate should decrease binding of recombinant Fc7 containing fusion proteins to the FcγRs in general. As above, the stop codon in the Fc7 sequence was mutated to TAA.\n\n\nFc8 is identical to the wild-type immunoglobulin γ region shown in SEQ ID NO:6, except that the cysteine residue at EU index position 220 (amino acid residue 24 of SEQ ID NO:6) was replaced with a serine residue. This mutation eliminated the cysteine residue that normally disulfide bonds with the immunoglobulin light chain constant region.\n\n\nIllustrative TACI-Fc constructs are described in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustrative TACI-Fc Fusion Protein Constructs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI Sequence\na\n \n\n\nFc Version\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI\nb\n \n\n\nFc4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI\nb\n \n\n\nFc5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI\nb\n \n\n\nFcγ1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI (d107-154)\n\n\nFc5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI (R119Q)\n\n\nFc4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI (1-104)-BCMA (42-54)\nc\n \n\n\nFc5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI (d143-150)\n\n\nFc5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI (R142G, d143-150)\n\n\nFc5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI (R119G, Q121P, R122Q, S123A)\n\n\nFc5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI(R119G, R122Q)\n\n\nFc5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI (d1-28, V29M)\n\n\nFc6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI (d1-29)\n\n\nFc6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI (d1-29)\n\n\nFc5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI (d1-29, d107-154)\n\n\nFc5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI (d1-29, d111-154)\n\n\nFc5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTACI (d1-29, d120-154)\n\n\nFc5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \na\nInformation about locations, mutations, and deletions of amino acid sequences is provided within parentheses in reference to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nb\nIncludes amino acid residues 1 to 154 of SEQ ID NO: 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nc\nThis construct includes amino acid residues 1 to 104 of SEQ ID NO: 2 (TACI) and amino acids 42 to 54 of SEQ ID NO: 27 (BCMA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe TACI-Fc proteins were produced by recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells, isolated, and analyzed using Western blot analysis and amino acid sequence analysis. Surprisingly, deletion of the first 29 amino acids from the N-terminus of the TACI polypeptide resulted in a ten-fold increase in the production of TACI-Fc fusion proteins by Chinese hamster ovary cells. This deletion also reduced the cleavage of the full-length stalk region. In addition, cleavage within the TACI stalk region was suppressed either by truncating the TACI stalk region, or by replacing the TACI stalk region within another amino acid sequence (e.g., the amino acid sequence of the BCMA stalk region).\n\n\nAs described in Example 4, functional analyses of TACI-Fc constructs indicate that fusion proteins TACI (d1-29)-Fc5, TACI (d1-29, d107-154)-Fc5, TACI (d1-29, d111-154)-Fc5, and TACI (d1-29, d120-154)-Fc5 have similar binding affinities for ZTNF4. However, constructs, TACI (d1-29)-Fc5, TACI (d1-29, d111-154)-Fc5, and TACI (d1-29, d120-154)-Fc5 appear to bind more ZTNF4 per mole of TACI-Fc than construct, TACI (d1-29, d107-154)-Fc5. Depending upon the intended use (i.e., therapeutic, diagnostic, or research), either high capacity or low capacity TACI-Fc fusion proteins can be employed. In addition, a combination of high capacity and low capacity TACI-Fc fusion proteins enables the titration of ZTNF2 or ZTNF4.\n\n\nThe present invention contemplates TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins that comprise a TACI receptor moiety consisting of \namino acid residues\n 30 to 106 of SEQ ID NO:2, 30 to 110 of SEQ ID NO:2, 30 to 119 of SEQ ID NO:2, or 30 to 154 of SEQ ID NO:2. The present invention also includes TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins that comprise a TACI receptor moiety consisting of amino acid residues 31 to 106 of SEQ ID NO:2, 31 to 110 of SEQ ID NO:2, 31 to 119 of SEQ ID NO:2, or 31 to 154 of SEQ ID NO:2.\n\n\nMore generally, the present invention includes TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins, wherein the TACI receptor moiety consists of a fragment of \namino acid residues\n 30 to 154 of SEQ ID NO:2, and wherein the TACI receptor moiety binds at least one of ZTNF2 or ZTNF4. Such fragments comprise a cysteine-rich pseudo-repeat region, and optionally, can include at least one of an N-terminal segment, which resides in an amino-terminal position to the cysteine-rich pseudo-repeat region, and a stalk segment, which resides in a carboxyl-terminal position to the cysteine-rich pseudo-repeat region. Suitable cysteine-rich pseudo-repeat regions include polypeptides that: (a) comprise at least one of amino acid residues 34 to 66 of SEQ ID NO:2, and amino acid residues 71 to 104 of SEQ ID NO:2, (b) comprise both amino acid residues 34 to 66 of SEQ ID NO:2, and amino acid residues 71 to 104 of SEQ ID NO:2, or (c) comprise amino acid residues 34 to 104 of SEQ ID NO:2.\n\n\nSuitable N-terminal segments include the following with reference to SEQ ID NO:2: amino acid residue 33, amino acid residues 32 to 33, amino acid residues 31 to 33, and \namino acid residues\n 30 to 33. Suitable stalk segments include one or more amino acids of amino acid residues 105 to 154 of SEQ ID NO:2. For example, the stalk segment can consist of the following with reference to SEQ ID NO:2: amino acid residue 105, amino acid residues 105 to 106, amino acid residues 105 to 107, amino acid residues 105 to 108, amino acid residues 105 to 109, amino acid residues 105 to 110, amino acid residues 105 to 111, amino acid residues 105 to 112, amino acid residues 105 to 113, amino acid residues 105 to 114, amino acid residues 105 to 115, amino acid residues 105 to 116, amino acid residues 105 to 117, amino acid residues 105 to 118, amino acid residues 105 to 119, amino acid residues 105 to 120, amino acid residues 105 to 121, amino acid residues 105 to 122, amino acid residues 105 to 123, amino acid residues 105 to 124, amino acid residues 105 to 125, amino acid residues 105 to 126, amino acid residues 105 to 127, amino acid residues 105 to 128, amino acid residues 105 to 129, amino acid residues 105 to 130, amino acid residues 105 to 131, amino acid residues 105 to 132, amino acid residues 105 to 133, amino acid residues 105 to 134, amino acid residues 105 to 135, amino acid residues 105 to 136, amino acid residues 105 to 137, amino acid residues 105 to 138, amino acid residues 105 to 139, amino acid residues 105 to 140, amino acid residues 105 to 141, amino acid residues 105 to 142, amino acid residues 105 to 143, amino acid residues 105 to 144, amino acid residues 105 to 145, amino acid residues 105 to 146, amino acid residues 105 to 147, amino acid residues 105 to 148, amino acid residues 105 to 149, amino acid residues 105 to 150, amino acid residues 105 to 151, amino acid residues 105 to 152, amino acid residues 105 to 153, and amino acid residues 105 to 154.\n\n\nAdditional suitable stalk segments include one or more amino acids of the BCMA stalk region (i.e., amino acid residues 42 to 54 of SEQ ID NO:27. For example, a stalk segment can consist of the following with reference to SEQ ID NO:27: amino acid residue 42, amino acid residues 42 to 43, amino acid residues 42 to 44, amino acid residues 42 to 45, amino acid residues 42 to 46, amino acid residues 42 to 47, amino acid residues 42 to 48, amino acid residues 42 to 49, amino acid residues 42 to 50, amino acid residues 42 to 51, amino acid residues 42 to 52, amino acid residues 42 to 53, and amino acid residues 42 to 54. More generally, a stalk segment can consist of two to 50 amino acid residues.\n\n\nThe immunoglobulin moiety of a fusion protein described herein comprises at least one constant region of an immunoglobulin. Preferably, the immunoglobulin moiety represents a segment of a human immunoglobulin. The human immunoglobulin sequence can be a wild-type amino acid sequence, or a modified wild-type amino acid sequence, which has at least one of the amino acid mutations discussed above.\n\n\nThe human immunoglobulin amino acid sequence can also vary from wild-type by having one or more mutations characteristic of a known allotypic determinant. Table 2 shows the allotypic determinants of the human IgGγ1 constant region (Putman, \nThe Plasma Proteins, Vol. V\n, pages 49 to 140 (Academic Press, Inc. 1987)). EU index positions 214, 356, 358, and 431 define the known IgGγ1 allotypes. Position 214 is in the C\nH1 \ndomain of the IgGγ1 constant region, and, therefore, does not reside within the Fc sequence. The wild-type Fc sequence of SEQ ID NO:6 includes the Glm(1) and Glm(2−) allotypes. However, the Fc moiety of a TACI-Fc protein can be modified to reflect any combination of these allotypes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllotypic Determinants of the Human Immunoglo-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbulin γ1 Constant Region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAmino Acid\n\n\nAmino Acid Position\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAllotype\n\n\nResidue\n\n\nEU Index\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlm(1)\n\n\nAsp, \n \nLeu\n \n \n\n\n356, 358\n\n\n160, 162\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlm(1−)\n\n\nGlu, \n \nMet\n \n \n\n\n356, 358\n\n\n160, 162\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlm(2)\n\n\n \nGly\n \n\n\n431\n\n\n235\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlm(2−)\n\n\n \nAla\n \n\n\n431\n\n\n235\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlm(3)\n\n\nArg\n\n\n214\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlm(3−)\n\n\nLys\n\n\n214\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe examples of TACI-Fc proteins disclosed herein comprise human IgG1 constant regions. However, suitable immunoglobulin moieties also include polypeptides comprising at least one constant region, such as a heavy chain constant region from any of the following immunoglobulins: IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, IgA2, IgD, IgE, and IgM. Advantageously, immunoglobulin moieties derived from wild-type IgG2 or wild-type IgG4 offer reduced effector function, compared with wild-type IgG1 or wild-type IgG3. The present invention also contemplates fusion proteins that comprise a TACI receptor moiety, as described above, and either albumin or β2-macroglobulin.\n\n\nAnother type of receptor fusion protein that binds ZTNF2 or ZTNF4 is a BCMA-immunoglobulin fusion protein. Studies have been performed with a BCMA-Fc4 fusion protein in which the BCMA moiety consists of amino acid residues 1 to 48 of SEQ ID NO:27. Surprisingly, pharmacokinetic studies in mice revealed that BCMA-Fc4 fusion protein had a half-life of about 101 hours, whereas a TACI-Fc protein had a half-life of 25 hours. Thus, administration of a BCMA-immunoglobulin fusion protein may be preferred in certain clinical settings. Moreover, a combination of TACI-immunoglobulin and BCMA-immunoglobulin fusion proteins may be advantageous to treat certain conditions. This combination therapy can be achieved by administering TACI-immunoglobulin and BCMA-immunoglobulin fusion proteins, or by administering heterodimers of TACI-immunoglobulin and BCMA-immunoglobulin fusion proteins.\n\n\nAnother type of receptor fusion protein that binds ZTNF4 is an immunoglobulin fusion protein comprising an extracellular domain of a receptor designated as “Ztnfr12. ” Ztnfr12 amino acid and nucleotide sequences are provided as SEQ ID NO:59 and SEQ ID NO:60, respectively. Suitable Ztnfr12 receptor moieties include polypeptides comprising amino acid residues 1 to 69 of SEQ ID NO:60, or amino acid residues 19 to 35 of SEQ ID NO:60.\n\n\nThe fusion proteins of the present invention can have the form of single chain polypeptides, dimers, trimers, or multiples of dimers or trimers. Dimers can be homodimers or heterodimers, and trimers can be homotrimers or heterotrimers. Examples of heterodimers include a TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptide with a BCMA-immunoglobulin polypeptide, a TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptide with a Ztnfr12-immunoglobulin polypeptide, and a BCMA-immunoglobulin polypeptide with a Ztnfr12-immunoglobulin polypeptide. Examples of heterotrimers include a TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptide with two BCMA-immunoglobulin polypeptides, a TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptide with two Ztnfr12-immunoglobulin polypeptides, a BCMA-immunoglobulin polypeptide with two Ztnfr12-immunoglobulin polypeptides, two TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptides with a BCMA-immunoglobulin polypeptide, two TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptides with a Ztnfr12-immunoglobulin polypeptide, two BCMA-immunoglobulin polypeptides with a Ztnfr12-immunoglobulin polypeptide, and a trimer of a TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptide, a BCMA-immunoglobulin polypeptide, and a Ztnfr12-immunoglobulin polypeptide.\n\n\nIn such fusion proteins, the TACI receptor moiety can comprise at least one of the following amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:2: \namino acid residues\n 30 to 154, amino acid residues 34 to 66, amino acid residues 71 to 104, amino acid residues 47 to 62, and amino acid residues 86 to 100. The BCMA receptor moiety can comprise at least one of the following amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:27: amino acid residues 1 to 48, amino acid residues 8 to 41, and amino acid residues 21 to 37. The Ztnfr12 receptor moiety can comprise at least one of the following amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:60: amino acid residues 1 to 69, and amino acid residues 19 to 35.\n\n\nFusion proteins can be produced using the PCR methods used to construct the illustrative TACI-Fc molecules, which are described in the Examples. However, those of skill in the art can use other standard approaches. For example, nucleic acid molecules encoding TACI, BCMA, Ztnfr12, or immunoglobulin polypeptides can be obtained by screening human cDNA or genomic libraries using polynucleotide probes based upon sequences disclosed herein. These techniques are standard and well-established (see, for example, Ausubel et al. (eds.), \nShort Protocols in Molecular Biology, \n3\nrd \n \nEdition\n, pages 4-1 to 4-6 (John Wiley & Sons 1995) (“Ausubel (1995)”); Wu et al., \nMethods in Gene Biotechnology\n, pages 33-41 (CRC Press, Inc. 1997) (“Wu (1997)”); Ausubel (1995) at pages 5-1 to 5-6; Wu (1997) at pages 307-327)).\n\n\nAlternatively, molecules for constructing immunoglobulin fusion proteins can be obtained by synthesizing nucleic acid molecules using mutually priming long oligonucleotides and the nucleotide sequences described herein (see, for example, Ausubel (1995) at pages 8-8 to 8-9). Established techniques using the polymerase chain reaction provide the ability to synthesize DNA molecules at least two kilobases in length (Adang et al., \nPlant Molec. Biol. \n21:1131 (1993), Bambot et al., \nPCR Methods and Applications \n2:266 (1993), Dillon et al., “Use of the Polymerase Chain Reaction for the Rapid Construction of Synthetic Genes,” in \nMethods in Molecular Biology, Vol. \n15: \nPCR Protocols: Current Methods and Applications\n, White (ed.), pages 263-268, (Humana Press, Inc. 1993), and Holowachuk et al., \nPCR Methods Appl. \n4:299 (1995)).\n\n\nThe nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can also be synthesized with “gene machines” using protocols such as the phosphoramidite method. If chemically-synthesized double stranded DNA is required for an application such as the synthesis of a gene or a gene fragment, then each complementary strand is made separately. The production of short genes (60 to 80 base pairs) is technically straightforward and can be accomplished by synthesizing the complementary strands and then annealing them. For the production of longer genes (>300 base pairs), however, special strategies may be required, because the coupling efficiency of each cycle during chemical DNA synthesis is seldom 100%. To overcome this problem, synthetic genes (double-stranded) are assembled in modular form from single-stranded fragments that are from 20 to 100 nucleotides in length. For reviews on polynucleotide synthesis, see, for example, Glick and Pasternak, \nMolecular Biotechnology, Principles and Applications of Recombinant DNA \n(ASM Press 1994), Itakura et al., \nAnnu. Rev. Biochem. \n53:323 (1984), and Climie et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n87:633 (1990).\n\n\n4. Production of TACI-Immunoglobulin Polypeptides\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the present invention can be produced in recombinant host cells following conventional techniques. To express a TACI-immunoglobulin-encoding sequence, a nucleic acid molecule encoding the polypeptide must be operably linked to regulatory sequences that control transcriptional expression in an expression vector and then, introduced into a host cell. In addition to transcriptional regulatory sequences, such as promoters and enhancers, expression vectors can include translational regulatory sequences and a marker gene, which is suitable for selection of cells that carry the expression vector.\n\n\nExpression vectors that are suitable for production of a foreign protein in eukaryotic cells typically contain (1) prokaryotic DNA elements coding for a bacterial replication origin and an antibiotic resistance marker to provide for the growth and selection of the expression vector in a bacterial host; (2) eukaryotic DNA elements that control initiation of transcription, such as a promoter; and (3) DNA elements that control the processing of transcripts, such as a transcription termination/polyadenylation sequence.\n\n\nExpression vectors can also include nucleotide sequences encoding a secretory sequence that directs the heterologous polypeptide into the secretory pathway of a host cell. For example, an expression vector may comprise a nucleotide sequence that encodes TACI-immunoglobulin and a secretory sequence derived from any secreted gene. As discussed above, one suitable signal sequence is a tPA signal sequence. An exemplary tPA signal sequence is provided by SEQ ID NO:25. Another suitable signal sequence is a murine 26-10 V\nH \nsignal sequence. The murine 26-10 antibody is described, for example, by Near et al., \nMol. Immunol. \n27:901 (1990). Illustrative amino acid and nucleotide sequences of a murine 26-10 V\nH \nsignal sequence are provided by SEQ ID NO:61 and SEQ ID NO:65, respectively. SEQ ID NO:62 discloses the amino acid sequence of a TACI-Fc5 fusion protein that comprises a murine 26-10 V\nH \nsignal sequence.\n\n\nTACI-immunoglobulin proteins of the present invention may be expressed in mammalian cells. Examples of suitable mammalian host cells include African green monkey kidney cells (Vero; ATCC CRL 1587), human embryonic kidney cells (293-HEK; ATCC CRL 1573), baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21, BHK-570; ATCC CRL 8544, ATCC CRL 10314), canine kidney cells (MDCK; ATCC CCL 34), Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1; ATCC CCL61; CHO DG44 (Chasin et al., \nSom. Cell. Molec. Genet. \n12:555, 1986)), rat pituitary cells (GH1; ATCC CCL82), HeLa S3 cells (ATCC CCL2.2), rat hepatoma cells (H-4-II-E; ATCC CRL 1548) SV40-transformed monkey kidney cells (COS-1; ATCC CRL 1650) and murine embryonic cells (NIH-3T3; ATCC CRL 1658).\n\n\nFor a mammalian host, the transcriptional and translational regulatory signals may be derived from viral sources, such as adenovirus, bovine papilloma virus, simian virus, or the like, in which the regulatory signals are associated with a particular gene which has a high level of expression. Suitable transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences also can be obtained from mammalian genes, such as actin, collagen, myosin, and metallothionein genes.\n\n\nTranscriptional regulatory sequences include a promoter region sufficient to direct the initiation of RNA synthesis. Suitable eukaryotic promoters include the promoter of the mouse metallothionein I gene (Hamer et al., \nJ. Molec. Appl. Genet. \n1:273 (1982)), the TK promoter of Herpes virus (McKnight, \nCell \n31:355 (1982)), the SV40 early promoter (Benoist et al., \nNature \n290:304 (1981)), the Rous sarcoma virus promoter (Gorman et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n79:6777 (1982)), the cytomegalovirus promoter (Foecking et al., \nGene \n45:101 (1980)), and the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter (see, generally, Etcheverry, “Expression of Engineered Proteins in Mammalian Cell Culture,” in \nProtein Engineering: Principles and Practice\n, Cleland et al. (eds.), pages 163-181 (John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1996)). One useful combination of a promoter and enhancer is provided by a myeloproliferative sarcoma virus promoter and a human cytomegalovirus enhancer.\n\n\nAlternatively, a prokaryotic promoter, such as the bacteriophage T3 RNA polymerase promoter, can be used to control production of TACI-immunoglobulin proteins in mammalian cells if the prokaryotic promoter is regulated by a eukaryotic promoter (Zhou et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol. \n10:4529 (1990), and Kaufman et al., \nNucl. Acids Res. \n19:4485 (1991)).\n\n\nAn expression vector can be introduced into host cells using a variety of standard techniques including calcium phosphate transfection, liposome-mediated transfection, microprojectile-mediated delivery, electroporation, and the like. The transfected cells can be selected and propagated to provide recombinant host cells that comprise the expression vector stably integrated in the host cell genome. Techniques for introducing vectors into eukaryotic cells and techniques for selecting such stable transformants using a dominant selectable marker are described, for example, by Ausubel (1995) and by Murray (ed.), \nGene Transfer and Expression Protocols (Humana Press \n1991).\n\n\nFor example, one suitable selectable marker is a gene that provides resistance to the antibiotic neomycin. In this case, selection is carried out in the presence of a neomycin-type drug, such as G-418 or the like. Selection systems can also be used to increase the expression level of the gene of interest, a process referred to as “amplification.” Amplification is carried out by culturing transfectants in the presence of a low level of the selective agent and then increasing the amount of selective agent to select for cells that produce high levels of the products of the introduced genes. A suitable amplifiable selectable marker is dihydrofolate reductase, which confers resistance to methotrexate. Other drug resistance genes (e.g., hygromycin resistance, multi-drug resistance, puromycin acetyltransferase) can also be used. Alternatively, markers that introduce an altered phenotype, such as green fluorescent protein, or cell surface proteins such as CD4, CD8, Class I MHC, placental alkaline phosphatase may be used to sort transfected cells from untransfected cells by such means as FACS sorting or magnetic bead separation technology.\n\n\nTACI-immunoglobulin polypeptides can also be produced by cultured mammalian cells using a viral delivery system. Exemplary viruses for this purpose include adenovirus, herpesvirus, vaccinia virus and adeno-associated virus (AAV).\n\n\nAdenovirus, a double-stranded DNA virus, is currently the best studied gene transfer vector for delivery of heterologous nucleic acid (for a review, see Becker et al., \nMeth. Cell Biol. \n43:161 (1994), and Douglas and Curiel, \nScience \n& \nMedicine \n4:44 (1997)). Advantages of the adenovirus system include the accommodation of relatively large DNA inserts, the ability to grow to high-titer, the ability to infect a broad range of mammalian cell types, and flexibility that allows use with a large number of available vectors containing different promoters.\n\n\nBy deleting portions of the adenovirus genome, larger inserts (up to 7 kb) of heterologous DNA can be accommodated. These inserts can be incorporated into the viral DNA by direct ligation or by homologous recombination with a co-transfected plasmid. An option is to delete the essential E1 gene from the viral vector, which results in the inability to replicate unless the E1 gene is provided by the host cell. Adenovirus vector-infected human 293 cells (ATCC Nos. CRL-1573, 45504, 45505), for example, can be grown as adherent cells or in suspension culture at relatively high cell density to produce significant amounts of protein (see Gamier et al., \nCytotechnol. \n \n\n\n15:145 (1994)).\n\n\nThose of skill in the art can devise suitable expression vectors for producing the fusion proteins described herein with mammalian cells. Example 4 describes features of one expression vector. As another example, an expression vector can comprise a bicistronic expression cassette that includes a portion of the human cytomegalovirus enhancer, the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus promoter, a nucleotide sequence encoding a fusion protein, the poliovirus internal ribosomal entry sites, a nucleotide sequence encoding murine dihydrofolate reductase, followed by the SV40 poly A addition sequence. The nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:69 shows a cytomegalovirus enhancer/myeloproliferative sarcoma virus LTR promoter construct, in which the cytomegalovirus enhancer extends from nucleotide 1 to 407. The myeloproliferative sarcoma virus LTR promoter, absent the negative control region extends from nucleotide 408 to nucleotide 884 of SEQ ID NO:69. A nucleotide sequence for the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus LTR promoter without the negative control region is provided in SEQ ID NO:70.\n\n\nExample 1 describes an expression vector that comprises a cytomegalovirus promoter to direct the expression of the recombinant protein transgene, an immunoglobulin intron, and a tissue plasminogen activator signal sequence. One suitable immunoglobulin intron is a murine 26-10 V\nH \nintron. SEQ ID NO:66 provides an illustrative nucleotide sequence of a murine 26-10 V\nH \nintron. An expression vector may also include a 5′ untranslated region (UTR) located upstream of the nucleotide sequence that encodes a TACI-immunoglobulin protein. A suitable 5′-UTR can be derived from the murine 26-10 V\nH \ngene. SEQ ID NO:63 discloses the nucleotide sequence of a useful native murine 26-10 V\nH \n5′-UTR, while SEQ ID NO:64 shows the nucleotide sequence of a murine 26-10 V\nH \n5′-UTR, which has been optimized at the 3′ end.\n\n\nAs an illustration, SEQ ID NO:67 provides a nucleotide sequence that includes the following elements: a native murine 26-10 V\nH \n5′-UTR (nucleotides 1 to 51), a murine 26-10 V\nH \nsignal sequence (nucleotides 52 to 97, and 182 to 192), a murine 26-10 V\nH \nintron (nucleotides 98 to 181), a nucleotide sequence that encodes a TACI moiety (nucleotides 193 to 435), and a nucleotide sequence that encodes an Fc5 moiety (nucleotides 436 to 1131). The nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:68 differs from SEQ ID NO:67 due to the replacement of an optimized murine 26-10 V\nH \n5′-UTR (nucleotides 1 to 51) for the native sequence.\n\n\nTACI-immunoglobulin proteins can also be expressed in other higher eukaryotic cells, such as avian, fungal, insect, yeast, or plant cells. The baculovirus system provides an efficient means to introduce cloned genes into insect cells. Suitable expression vectors are based upon the \nAutographa californica \nmultiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV), and contain well-known promoters such as \nDrosophila \nheat shock protein (hsp) 70 promoter, \nAutographa californica \nnuclear polyhedrosis virus immediate-early gene promoter (ie-1) and the delayed early 39K promoter, baculovirus p10 promoter, and the \nDrosophila metallothionein \npromoter. A second method of making recombinant baculovirus utilizes a transposon-based system described by Luckow (Luckow, et al., \nJ. Virol. \n67:4566 (1993)). This system, which utilizes transfer vectors, is sold in the BAC-to-BAC kit (Life Technologies, Rockville, Md.). This system utilizes a transfer vector, PFASTBAC (Life Technologies) containing a Tn7 transposon to move the DNA encoding the TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptide into a baculovirus genome maintained in \nE. coli \nas a large plasmid called a “bacmid.” See, Hill-Perkins and Possee, \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n71:971 (1990), Bonning, et al., \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n75:1551 (1994), and Chazenbalk, and Rapoport, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n270:1543 (1995). In addition, transfer vectors can include an in-frame fusion with DNA encoding an epitope tag at the C- or N-terminus of the expressed TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptide, for example, a Glu-Glu epitope tag (Grussenmeyer et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. \n82:7952 (1985)). Using a technique known in the art, a transfer vector containing a nucleotide sequence that encodes a TACI-immunoglobulin protein is transformed into \nE. coli\n, and screened for bacmids, which contain an interrupted lacZ gene indicative of recombinant baculovirus. The bacmid DNA containing the recombinant baculovirus genome is then isolated using common techniques.\n\n\nThe illustrative PFASTBAC vector can be modified to a considerable degree. For example, the polyhedrin promoter can be removed and substituted with the baculovirus basic protein promoter (also known as Pcor, p6.9 or MP promoter) which is expressed earlier in the baculovirus infection, and has been shown to be advantageous for expressing secreted proteins (see, for example, Hill-Perkins and Possee, \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n71:971 (1990), Bonning, et al., \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n75:1551 (1994), and Chazenbalk and Rapoport, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n270:1543 (1995). In such transfer vector constructs, a short or long version of the basic protein promoter can be used. Moreover, transfer vectors can be constructed, with secretory signal sequences derived from insect proteins. For example, a secretory signal sequence from Ecdysteroid Glucosyltransferase (EGT), honey bee Melittin (Invitrogen Corporation; Carlsbad, Calif.), or baculovirus gp67 (PharMingen: San Diego, Calif.) can be used in such constructs.\n\n\nThe recombinant virus or bacmid is used to transfect host cells. Suitable insect host cells include cell lines derived from IPLB-Sf-21, a \nSpodoptera frugiperda \npupal ovarian cell line, such as Sf9 (ATCC CRL 1711), Sf21AE, and Sf21 (Invitrogen Corporation; San Diego, Calif.), as well as \nDrosophila \nSchneider-2 cells, and the HIGH FIVEO cell line (Invitrogen) derived from \nTrichoplusia ni \n(U.S. Pat. No. 5,300,435). Commercially available serum-free media can be used to grow and to maintain the cells. Suitable media are Sf900 II™ (Life Technologies) or ESF 921™ (Expression Systems) for the Sf9 cells; and Ex-cellO405™ (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, Kans.) or Express FiveO™ (Life Technologies) for the \nT. ni \ncells. When recombinant virus is used, the cells are typically grown up from an inoculation density of approximately 2-5×10\n5 \ncells to a density of 1-2×10\n6 \ncells at which time a recombinant viral stock is added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 to 10, more typically near 3.\n\n\nEstablished techniques for producing recombinant proteins in baculovirus systems are provided by Bailey et al., “Manipulation of Baculovirus Vectors,” in \nMethods in Molecular Biology, Volume \n7: \nGene Transfer and Expression Protocols\n, Murray (ed.), pages 147-168 (The Humana Press, Inc. 1991), by Patel et al., “The baculovirus expression system,” in \nDNA Cloning \n2: \nExpression Systems, \n2\nnd Edition\n, Glover et al. (eds.), pages 205-244 (Oxford University Press 1995), by Ausubel (1995) at pages 16-37 to 16-57, by Richardson (ed.), \nBaculovirus Expression Protocols \n(The Humana Press, Inc. 1995), and by Lucknow, “Insect Cell Expression Technology,” in \nProtein Engineering: Principles and Practice\n, Cleland et al. (eds.), pages 183-218 (John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1996).\n\n\nFungal cells, including yeast cells, can also be used to express the genes described herein. Yeast species of particular interest in this regard include \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris\n, and \nPichia methanolica\n. Suitable promoters for expression in yeast include promoters from GAL1 (galactose), PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase), ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase), AOX1 (alcohol oxidase), HIS4 (histidinol dehydrogenase), and the like. Many yeast cloning vectors have been designed and are readily available. A vector can be designed to generate constructs utilizing the necessary elements to carry out homologous recombination in yeast (see, for example, Raymond et al., \nBioTechniques \n26:134 (1999)). For example, such an expression vector can include URA3 and CEN-ARS (autonomously replicating sequence) sequences required for selection and replication in \nS. cerevisiae\n. Other suitable vectors include YIp-based vectors, such as YIp5, YRp vectors, such as YRp17, YEp vectors such as YEp13 and YCp vectors, such as YCp19. Methods for transforming \nS. cerevisiae \ncells with exogenous DNA and producing recombinant polypeptides from these cells are disclosed by, for example, Kawasaki, U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,311, Kawasaki et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,931,373, Brake, U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,008, Welch et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,037,743, and Murray et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,845,075. Transformed cells are selected by phenotype determined by the selectable marker, commonly drug resistance or the ability to grow in the absence of a particular nutrient (e.g., leucine). A suitable vector system for use in \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae \nis the POT1 vector system disclosed by Kawasaki et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,931,373), which allows transformed cells to be selected by growth in glucose-containing media. Additional suitable promoters and terminators for use in yeast include those from glycolytic enzyme genes (see, e.g., Kawasaki, U.S. Pat. No. 4,599,311, Kingsman et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,615,974, and Bitter, U.S. Pat. No. 4,977,092) and alcohol dehydrogenase genes. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,990,446, 5,063,154, 5,139,936, and 4,661,454.\n\n\nTransformation systems for other yeasts, including \nHansenula polymorpha, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces fragilis, Ustilago maydis, Pichia pastoris, Pichia methanolica, Pichia guillermondii \nand \nCandida maltosa \nare known in the art. See, for example, Gleeson et al., \nJ. Gen. Microbiol. \n132:3459 (1986), and Cregg, U.S. Pat. No. 4,882,279. \nAspergillus \ncells may be utilized according to the methods of McKnight et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,935,349. Methods for transforming \nAcremonium chrysogenum \nare disclosed by Sumino et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,228. Methods for \ntransforming \nNeurospora are disclosed by Lambowitz, U.S. Pat. No. 4,486,533.\n\n\nFor example, the use of \nPichia methanolica \nas host for the production of recombinant proteins is disclosed by Raymond, U.S. Pat. No. 5,716,808, Raymond, U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,383, Raymond et al., \nYeast \n14:11-23 (1998), and in international publication Nos. WO 97/17450, WO 97/17451, WO 98/02536, and WO 98/02565. DNA molecules for use in transforming \nP. methanolica \nwill commonly be prepared as double-stranded, circular plasmids, which are preferably linearized prior to transformation. For polypeptide production in \nP. methanolica\n, the promoter and terminator in the plasmid can be that of a \nP. methanolica \ngene, such as a \nP. methanolica \nalcohol utilization gene (AUG1 or AUG2). Other useful promoters include those of the dihydroxyacetone synthase (DHAS), formate dehydrogenase (FMD), and catalase (CAT) genes. To facilitate integration of the DNA into the host chromosome, it is preferred to have the entire expression segment of the plasmid flanked at both ends by host DNA sequences. A suitable selectable marker for use in \nPichia methanolica \nis a \nP. methanolica \nADE2 gene, which encodes phosphoribosyl-5-aminoimidazole carboxylase (AIRC; EC 4.1.1.21), and which allows ade2 host cells to grow in the absence of adenine. For large-scale, industrial processes where it is desirable to minimize the use of methanol, host cells can be used in which both methanol utilization genes (AUG1 and AUG2) are deleted. For production of secreted proteins, host cells can be deficient in vacuolar protease genes (PEP4 and PRB1). Electroporation is used to facilitate the introduction of a plasmid containing DNA encoding a polypeptide of interest into \nP. methanolica \ncells. \nP. methanolica \ncells can be transformed by electroporation using an exponentially decaying, pulsed electric field having a field strength of from 2.5 to 4.5 kV/cm, preferably about 3.75 kV/cm, and a time constant (t) of from 1 to 40 milliseconds, most preferably about 20 milliseconds.\n\n\nExpression vectors can also be introduced into plant protoplasts, intact plant tissues, or isolated plant cells. Methods for introducing expression vectors into plant tissue include the direct infection or co-cultivation of plant tissue with \nAgrobacterium tumefaciens\n, microprojectile-mediated delivery, DNA injection, electroporation, and the like. See, for example, Horsch et al., \nScience \n227:1229 (1985), Klein et al., \nBiotechnology \n10:268 (1992), and Miki et al., “Procedures for Introducing Foreign DNA into Plants,” in \nMethods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology\n, Glick et al. (eds.), pages 67-88 (CRC Press, 1993).\n\n\nAlternatively, TACI-immunoglobulin proteins can be produced in prokaryotic host cells. Suitable promoters that can be used to produce TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptides in a prokaryotic host are well-known to those of skill in the art and include promoters capable of recognizing the T4, T3, Sp6 and T7 polymerases, the P\nR \nand P\nL \npromoters of bacteriophage lambda, the trp, recA, heat shock, lacUV5, tac, lpp-lacSpr,phoA, and lacZ promoters of \nE. coli\n, promoters of \nB. subtilis\n, the promoters of the bacteriophages of \nBacillus, Streptomyces \npromoters, the int promoter of bacteriophage lambda, the bla promoter of pBR322, and the CAT promoter of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene. Prokaryotic promoters have been reviewed by Glick, \nJ. Ind. Microbiol. \n1:277 (1987), Watson et al., \nMolecular Biology of the Gene, \n4th Ed. (Benjamin Cummins 1987), and by Ausubel et al. (1995).\n\n\nSuitable prokaryotic hosts include \nE. coli \nand \nBacillus subtilus\n. Suitable strains of \nE. coli \ninclude BL21(DE3), BL21(DE3)pLysS, BL21(DE3)pLysE, DH1, DH4I, DH5, DH5I, DH5IF′, DH5IMCR, DH10B, DH10B/p3, DH11S, C600, HB101, JM101, JM105, JM109, JM110, K38, RR1, Y1088, Y1089, CSH18, ER1451, and\n\n\nER1647 (see, for example, Brown (ed.), \nMolecular Biology Labfax \n(Academic Press 1991)). Suitable strains of \nBacillus subtilus \ninclude BR151, YB886, MI119, MI120, and B170 (see, for example, Hardy, “\nBacillus \nCloning Methods,” in \nDNA Cloning: A Practical Approach\n, Glover (ed.) (IRL Press 1985)).\n\n\nWhen expressing a TACI-immunoglobulin protein in bacteria such as \nE. coli\n, the polypeptide may be retained in the cytoplasm, typically as insoluble granules, or may be directed to the periplasmic space by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the former case, the cells are lysed, and the granules are recovered and denatured using, for example, guanidine isothiocyanate or urea. The denatured polypeptide can then be refolded and dimerized by diluting the denaturant, such as by dialysis against a solution of urea and a combination of reduced and oxidized glutathione, followed by dialysis against a buffered saline solution. In the latter case, the polypeptide can be recovered from the periplasmic space in a soluble and functional form by disrupting the cells (by, for example, sonication or osmotic shock) to release the contents of the periplasmic space and recovering the protein, thereby obviating the need for denaturation and refolding.\n\n\nMethods for expressing proteins in prokaryotic hosts are well-known to those of skill in the art (see, for example, Williams et al., “Expression of foreign proteins in \nE. coli \nusing plasmid vectors and purification of specific polyclonal antibodies,” in \nDNA Cloning \n2: \nExpression Systems, \n2\nnd Edition\n, Glover et al. (eds.), page 15 (Oxford University Press 1995), Ward et al., “Genetic Manipulation and Expression of Antibodies,” in \nMonoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Applications\n, page 137 (Wiley-Liss, Inc. 1995), and Georgiou, “Expression of Proteins in Bacteria,” in \nProtein Engineering: Principles and Practice\n, Cleland et al. (eds.), page 101 (John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1996)).\n\n\nStandard methods for introducing expression vectors into bacterial, yeast, insect, and plant cells are provided, for example, by Ausubel (1995).\n\n\nGeneral methods for expressing and recovering foreign protein produced by a mammalian cell system are provided by, for example, Etcheverry, “Expression of Engineered Proteins in Mammalian Cell Culture,” in \nProtein Engineering: Principles and Practice\n, Cleland et al. (eds.), pages 163 (Wiley-Liss, Inc. 1996). Standard techniques for recovering protein produced by a bacterial system is provided by, for example, Grisshammer et al., “Purification of over-produced proteins from \nE. coli \ncells,” in \nDNA Cloning \n2: \nExpression Systems, \n2\nnd Edition\n, Glover et al. (eds.), pages 59-92 (Oxford University Press 1995). Established methods for isolating recombinant proteins from a baculovirus system are described by Richardson (ed.), \nBaculovirus Expression Protocols \n(The Humana Press, Inc. 1995).\n\n\nAs an alternative, polypeptides of the present invention can be synthesized by exclusive solid phase synthesis, partial solid phase methods, fragment condensation or classical solution synthesis. These synthesis methods are well-known to those of skill in the art (see, for example, Merrifield, \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n85:2149 (1963), Stewart et al., “Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis” (2nd Edition), (Pierce Chemical Co. 1984), Bayer and Rapp, \nChem. Pept. Prot. \n3:3 (1986), Atherton et al., \nSolid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach \n(IRL Press 1989), Fields and Colowick, “Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis,” \nMethods in Enzymology Volume \n289 (Academic Press 1997), and Lloyd-Williams et al., \nChemical Approaches to the Synthesis of Peptides and Proteins \n(CRC Press, Inc. 1997)). Variations in total chemical synthesis strategies, such as “native chemical ligation” and “expressed protein ligation” are also standard (see, for example, Dawson et al., \nScience \n266:776 (1994), Hackeng et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n94:7845 (1997), Dawson, \nMethods Enzymol. \n287: 34 (1997), Muir et al, \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n95:6705 (1998), and Severinov and Muir, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n273:16205 (1998)).\n\n\n5. Assays for TACI-Immunoglobulin Fusion Proteins\n\n\nThe function of TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins can be examined using a variety of approaches to assess the ability of the fusion proteins to bind ZTNF4 or ZTNF2. As an illustration, Example 4 provides methods for measuring ZTNF4 binding affinity and binding capacity.\n\n\nAlternatively, TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins can be characterized by the ability to inhibit the stimulation of human B cells by soluble ZTNF4, as described by Gross et al., international publication No. WO00/40716. Briefly, human B cells are isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using CD19 magnetic beads and the VarioMacs magnetic separation system (Miltenyi Biotec Auburn, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified B cells are mixed with soluble ZTNF4 (25 ng/ml) and recombinant human IL-4 (10 ng/ml Pharmingen), and the cells are plated onto round bottom 96 well plates at 1×10\n5 \ncells per well.\n\n\nSoluble TACI-immunoglobulin proteins can be diluted from about 5 μg/ml to about 6 ng/ml, and incubated with the B cells for five days, pulsing overnight on day four with 1 μCi \n3\nH-thymidine per well. As a control, TACI-immunoglobulin protein can also be incubated with B cells and IL-4 without ZTNF4. Plates are harvested using Packard plate harvester, and counted using the Packard reader.\n\n\nThis general approach was used to examine three TACI-Fc fusion proteins. Although all fusion proteins inhibited B cell proliferation, constructs TACI (d1-29, d111-154)-Fc5 and TACI (d1-29, d120-154)-Fc5 were more potent than TACI (d1-29, d107-154)-Fc5.\n\n\nWell-established animal models are available to test in vivo efficacy of TACI-immunoglobulin proteins in certain disease states. For example, TACI-immunoglobulin proteins can be tested in a number of animal models of autoimmune disease, such as MRL-lpr/lpr or NZB×NZW F1 congenic mouse strains, which serve as a model of SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus). Such animal models are known in the art (see, for example, Cohen and Miller (Eds.), \nAutoimmune Disease Models: A Guidebook \n(Academic Press, Inc. 1994).\n\n\nOffspring of a cross between New Zealand Black (NZB) and New Zealand White (NZW) mice develop a spontaneous form of SLE that closely resembles SLE in humans. The offspring mice, known as NZBW begin to develop IgM autoantibodies against T-cells at one month of age, and by five to seven months of age, anti-DNA autoantibodies are the dominant immunoglobulin. Polyclonal B-cell hyperactivity leads to overproduction of autoantibodies. The deposition of these autoantibodies, particularly those directed against single stranded DNA, is associated with the development of glomerulonephritis, which manifests clinically as proteinuria, azotemia, and death from renal failure.\n\n\nKidney failure is the leading cause of death in mice affected with spontaneous SLE, and in the NZBW strain, this process is chronic and obliterative. The disease is more rapid and severe in females than males, with mean survival of only 245 days as compared to 406 days for the males. While many of the female mice will be symptomatic (proteinuria) by seven to nine months of age, some can be much younger or older when they develop symptoms. The fatal immune nephritis seen in the NZBW mice is very similar to the glomerulonephritis seen in human SLE, making this spontaneous murine model very attractive for testing of potential SLE therapeutics (Putterman and Naparstek, “Murine Models of Spontaneous Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,” in \nAutoimmune Disease Models: A Guidebook\n, pages 217-234 (Academic Press, Inc., 1994); Mohan et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n154:1470 (1995); and Daikh et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n159:3104 (1997)).\n\n\nAs described by Gross et al., international publication No. WO00/40716, TACI-immunoglobulin proteins can be administered to NZBW mice to monitor its suppressive effect on B cells over the five-week period when, on average, B-cell autoantibody production is believed to be at high levels in NZBW mice. Briefly, 100 8-week old female (NZB×NZW)F\n1 \nmice can be divided into six groups of 15 mice. Prior to treatment, the mice are monitored once a month for urine protein, and blood is drawn for CBC and serum banking. Serum can be screened for the presence of autoantibodies. Because proteinuria is the hallmark sign of glomerulonephritis, urine protein levels are monitored by dipstick at regular intervals over the course of the study. Treatment can begin when mice are approximately five months of age. The mice receive intraperitoneal injections of vehicle only (phosphate buffered saline) or human TACI-immunoglobulin (control protein) or TACI-immunoglobulin protein (e.g., 20 to 100 μg test protein per dose) three times a week for five weeks.\n\n\nBlood is collected twice during treatment, and will be collected at least twice following treatment. Urine dipstick values for proteinuria and body weights are determined every two weeks after treatment begins. Blood, urine dipstick value and body weight are collected at the time of euthanasia. The spleen and thymus are divided for fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis and histology. Submandibular salivary glands, mesenteric lymph node chain, liver lobe with gall bladder, cecum and large intestine, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, right kidney, adrenal gland, tongue with trachea and esophagus, heart and lungs are also collected for histology.\n\n\nMurine models for experimental allergic encephalomyelitis have been used as a tool to investigate both the mechanisms of immune-mediated disease, and methods of potential therapeutic intervention. The model resembles human multiple sclerosis, and produces demyelination as a result of T-cell activation to neuroproteins such as myelin basic protein, or proteolipid protein. Inoculation with antigen leads to induction of CD4+, class II MHC-restricted T-cells (Th1). Changes in the protocol for experimental allergic encephalomyelitis can produce acute, chronic-relapsing, or passive-transfer variants of the model (Weinberg et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n162:1818 (1999); Mijaba et al., \nCell. Immunol. \n186:94 (1999); and Glabinski, \nMeth. Enzym. \n288:182 (1997)).\n\n\nGross et al., international publication No. WO00/40716, describe one approach to evaluating the efficacy of TACI-immunoglobulin proteins in the amelioration of symptoms associated with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Briefly, 25 female PLxSJL F1 mice (12 weeks old) are given a subcutaneous injection of 125 μg/mouse of antigen (myelin Proteolipid Protein, PLP, residues 139-151), formulated in complete Freund's Adjuvant. The mice are divided into five groups of five mice. Intraperitoneal injections of pertussis toxin (400 ng) are given on Day 0 and 2. The groups are given a 1×, 10×, or 100× dose of TACI-immunoglobulin protein, one group will receive vehicle only, and one group will receive no treatment. Prevention therapy begins on Day 0, intervention therapy begins on day 7, or at onset of clinical signs. Signs of disease, weight loss, and paralysis manifest in approximately 10 to 14 days, and last for about one week. Animals are assessed daily by collecting body weights and assigning a clinical score to correspond to the extent of their symptoms. Clinical signs of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis appear within 10 to 14 days of inoculation and persist for approximately one week. At the end of the study, all animals are euthanized by gas overdose, and necropsied. The brain and spinal column are collected for histology or frozen for mRNA analysis. Body weight and clinical score data are plotted by individual and by group.\n\n\nIn the collagen-induced arthritis model, mice develop chronic inflammatory arthritis, which closely resembles human rheumatoid arthritis. Since collagen-induced arthritis shares similar immunological and pathological features with rheumatoid arthritis, this makes it an ideal model for screening potential human anti-inflammatory compounds. Another advantage in using the collagen-induced arthritis model is that the mechanisms of pathogenesis are known. The T and B cell epitopes on type II collagen have been identified, and various immunological (delayed-type hypersensitivity and anti-collagen antibody) and inflammatory (cytokines, chemokines, and matrix-degrading enzymes) parameters relating to immune-mediating arthritis have been determined, and can be used to assess test compound efficacy in the models (Wooley, \nCurr. Opin. Rheum. \n3:407 (1999); Williams et al., \nImmunol. \n89:9784 (1992); Myers et al., \nLife Sci. \n61:1861 (1997); and Wang et al., \nImmunol. \n92:8955 (1995)).\n\n\nGross et al., international publication No. WO00/40716, describe a method for evaluating the efficacy of TACI-immunoglobulin proteins in the amelioration of symptoms associated with collagen-induced arthritis. In brief, eight-week old male DBA/1J mice (Jackson Labs) are divided into groups of five mice/group and are given two subcutaneous injections of 50 to 100 μl of 1 mg/ml collagen (chick or bovine origin), at three week intervals. One control does not receive collagen injections. The first injection is formulated in Complete Freund's Adjuvant, and the second injection is formulated in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant. TACI-immunoglobulin protein is administered prophylactically at or before the second injection, or after the animal develops a clinical score of two or more that persists at least 24 hours. Animals begin to show symptoms of arthritis following the second collagen injection, usually within two to three weeks. For example, TACI-Fc, a control protein, human IgFc, or phosphate-buffered saline (vehicle) can be administered prophylactically beginning seven days before the second injection (day −7). Proteins can be administered at 100 μg, given three times a week as a 200 μl intraperitoneal injection, and continued for four weeks.\n\n\nIn the collagen-induced arthritis model, the extent of disease is evaluated in each paw using a caliper to measure paw thickness and assigning a clinical score to each paw. For example, a clinical score of “0” indicates a normal mouse, a score of “1” indicates that one or more toes are inflamed, a score of “2” indicates mild paw inflammation, a score of “3” indicates moderate paw inflammation, and a score of “4” indicates severe paw inflammation Animals are euthanized after the disease as been established for a set period of time, usually seven days. Paws are collected for histology or mRNA analysis, and serum is collected for immunoglobulin and cytokine assays.\n\n\nMyasthenia gravis is another autoimmune disease for which murine models are available. Myasthenia gravis is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission involving the production of autoantibodies directed against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. This disease is acquired or inherited with clinical features including abnormal weakness and fatigue on exertion.\n\n\nA murine model of myasthenia gravis has been established. (Christadoss et al., “Establishment of a Mouse Model of Myasthenia gravis Which Mimics Human Myasthenia gravid Pathogenesis for Immune Intervention,” in \nImmunobiology of Proteins and Peptides VIII\n, Atassi and Bixler (Eds.), pages 195-199 (1995)). Experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis is an antibody mediated disease characterized by the presence of antibodies to acetylcholine receptor. These antibodies destroy the receptor leading to defective neuromuscular electrical impulses, resulting in muscle weakness. In the experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis model, mice are immunized with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Clinical signs of myasthenia gravis become evident weeks after the second immunization. Experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis is evaluated by several methods including measuring serum levels of acetylcholine receptor antibodies by radioimmunoassay (Christadoss and Dauphinee, \nJ. Immunol. \n136:2437 (1986); Lindstrom et al., \nMethods Enzymol. \n74:432 (1981)), measuring muscle acetylcholine receptor, or electromyography (Coligan et al. (Eds.), \nProtocols in Immunology. Vol. \n3, page 15.8.1 (John Wiley & Sons, 1997)).\n\n\nThe effect of TACI-immunoglobulin on experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis can be determined by administering fusion proteins during ongoing clinical myasthenia gravis in B6 mice. For example, 100 B6 mice are immunized with 20 μg acetylcholine receptor in complete Freund's adjuvant on \ndays\n 0 and 30. Approximately 40 to 60% of mice will develop moderate (grade 2) to severe (grade 3) clinical myasthenia gravis after the boost with acetylcholine receptor. Mice with grade 2 and 3 clinical disease are divided into three groups (with equal grades of weakness) and weighed (mice with weakness also lose weight, since they have difficulty in consuming food and water) and bled for serum (for pre-treatment anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody and isotype level). Group A is injected I.P with phosphate buffered saline, group B is injected intraperitoneally with human IgG-Fc as a control protein (100 μg), and group C is injected with 100 μg of TACI-Fc three times a week for four weeks. Mice are screened for clinical muscle weakness twice a week, and weighed and bled for \nserum\n 15 and 30 days after the commencement of treatment. Whole blood is collected on day 15 to determine T/B cell ratio by fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis using markers B220 and CD5. Surviving mice are killed 30 to 45 days after the initiation of treatment, and their carcasses are frozen for later extraction of muscle acetylcholine receptor to determine the loss of muscle acetylcholine receptor, the primary pathology in myasthenia gravis (see, for example, Coligan et al. (Eds.), \nProtocols in Immunology. Vol. \n3, page 15.8.1 (John Wiley & Sons, 1997)).\n\n\nSerum antibodies to mouse muscle acetylcholine receptor can be determined by an established radioimmunoassay, and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody isotypes (IgM, IgG1, IgG2b and IgG2c) is measured by ELISA. Such methods are known. The effects of TACI-immunoglobulin on ongoing clinical myasthenia gravis, anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody and isotype level, and muscle acetylcholine receptor loss are determined\n\n\nApproximately 100 mice can be immunized with 20 μg acetylcholine receptor in complete Freund's adjuvant on \nday\n 0 and 30. Mice with clinical myasthenia gravis are divided into four groups. Group A is injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg control Fc, group B is injected with 20 μg control Fc, group C is injected with 100 μg TACI-Fc, and group D is injected with 20 μg TACI-Fc three times a week for four weeks. Mice are weighed and bled for serum before, and 15 and 30 days after the start of the treatment. Serum is tested for anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody and isotypes as described above. Muscle acetylcholine receptor loss can also be measured.\n\n\nOther suitable assays of TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins can be determined by those of skill in the art.\n\n\n6. Production of TACI-Immunoglobulin Conjugates\n\n\nThe present invention includes chemically modified TACI-immunoglobulin compositions, in which a TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptide is linked with a polymer. Typically, the polymer is water-soluble so that the TACI-immunoglobulin conjugate does not precipitate in an aqueous environment, such as a physiological environment. An example of a suitable polymer is one that has been modified to have a single reactive group, such as an active ester for acylation, or an aldehyde for alkylation, In this way, the degree of polymerization can be controlled. An example of a reactive aldehyde is polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde, or mono-(C\n1\n-C\n10\n) alkoxy, or aryloxy derivatives thereof (see, for example, Harris, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,714). The polymer may be branched or unbranched. Moreover, a mixture of polymers can be used to produce TACI-immunoglobulin conjugates.\n\n\nTACI-immunoglobulin conjugates used for therapy can comprise pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble polymer moieties. Suitable water-soluble polymers include polyethylene glycol (PEG), monomethoxy-PEG, mono-(C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkoxy-PEG, aryloxy-PEG, poly-(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)PEG, tresyl monomethoxy PEG, PEG propionaldehyde, bis-succinimidyl carbonate PEG, propylene glycol homopolymers, a polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymer, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol), polyvinyl alcohol, dextran, cellulose, or other carbohydrate-based polymers. Suitable PEG may have a molecular weight from about 600 to about 60,000, including, for example, 5,000, 12,000, 20,000 and 25,000. A TACI-immunoglobulin conjugate can also comprise a mixture of such water-soluble polymers.\n\n\nOne example of a TACI-immunoglobulin conjugate comprises a TACI-immunoglobulin moiety and a polyalkyl oxide moiety attached to the N-terminus of the TACI-immunoglobulin. PEG is one suitable polyalkyl oxide. As an illustration, TACI-immunoglobulin can be modified with PEG, a process known as “PEGylation.” PEGylation of TACI-immunoglobulin can be carried out by any of the PEGylation reactions known in the art (see, for example, EP 0 154 316, Delgado et al., \nCritical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems \n9:249 (1992), Duncan and Spreafico, \nClin. Pharmacokinet. \n27:290 (1994), and Francis et al., \nInt J Hematol \n68:1 (1998)). For example, PEGylation can be performed by an acylation reaction or by an alkylation reaction with a reactive polyethylene glycol molecule. In an alternative approach, TACI-immunoglobulin conjugates are formed by condensing activated PEG, in which a terminal hydroxy or amino group of PEG has been replaced by an activated linker (see, for example, Karasiewicz et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,382,657).\n\n\nPEGylation by acylation typically requires reacting an active ester derivative of PEG with a TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptide. An example of an activated PEG ester is PEG esterified to N-hydroxysuccinimide. As used herein, the term “acylation” includes the following types of linkages between TACI-immunoglobulin and a water-soluble polymer: amide, carbamate, urethane, and the like. Methods for preparing PEGylated TACI-immunoglobulin by acylation will typically comprise the steps of (a) reacting a TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptide with PEG (such as a reactive ester of an aldehyde derivative of PEG) under conditions whereby one or more PEG groups attach to TACI-immunoglobulin, and (b) obtaining the reaction product(s). Generally, the optimal reaction conditions for acylation reactions will be determined based upon known parameters and desired results. For example, the larger the ratio of PEG:TACI-immunoglobulin, the greater the percentage of polyPEGylated TACI-immunoglobulin product.\n\n\nThe product of PEGylation by acylation is typically a polyPEGylated TACI-immunoglobulin product, wherein the lysine ε-amino groups are PEGylated via an acyl linking group. An example of a connecting linkage is an amide. Typically, the resulting TACI-immunoglobulin will be at least 95% mono-, di-, or tri-pegylated, although some species with higher degrees of PEGylation may be formed depending upon the reaction conditions. PEGylated species can be separated from unconjugated TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptides using standard purification methods, such as dialysis, ultrafiltration, ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, and the like.\n\n\nPEGylation by alkylation generally involves reacting a terminal aldehyde derivative of PEG with TACI-immunoglobulin in the presence of a reducing agent. PEG groups can be attached to the polypeptide via a —CH\n2\n—NH group.\n\n\nDerivatization via reductive alkylation to produce a monoPEGylated product takes advantage of the differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups available for derivatization. Typically, the reaction is performed at a pH that allows one to take advantage of the pKa differences between the ε-amino groups of the lysine residues and the α-amino group of the N-terminal residue of the protein. By such selective derivatization, attachment of a water-soluble polymer that contains a reactive group such as an aldehyde, to a protein is controlled. The conjugation with the polymer occurs predominantly at the N-terminus of the protein without significant modification of other reactive groups such as the lysine side chain amino groups. The present invention provides a substantially homogenous preparation of TACI-immunoglobulin monopolymer conjugates.\n\n\nReductive alkylation to produce a substantially homogenous population of monopolymer TACI-immunoglobulin conjugate molecule can comprise the steps of: (a) reacting a TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptide with a reactive PEG under reductive alkylation conditions at a pH suitable to permit selective modification of the α-amino group at the amino terminus of the TACI-immunoglobulin, and (b) obtaining the reaction product(s). The reducing agent used for reductive alkylation should be stable in aqueous solution and able to reduce only the Schiff base formed in the initial process of reductive alkylation. Illustrative reducing agents include sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, dimethylamine borane, trimethylamine borane, and pyridine borane.\n\n\nFor a substantially homogenous population of monopolymer TACI-immunoglobulin conjugates, the reductive alkylation reaction conditions are those that permit the selective attachment of the water soluble polymer moiety to the N-terminus of TACI-immunoglobulin. Such reaction conditions generally provide for pKa differences between the lysine amino groups and the α-amino group at the N-terminus. The pH also affects the ratio of polymer to protein to be used. In general, if the pH is lower, a larger excess of polymer to protein will be desired because the less reactive the N-terminal α-group, the more polymer is needed to achieve optimal conditions. If the pH is higher, the polymer:TACI-immunoglobulin need not be as large because more reactive groups are available. Typically, the pH will fall within the range of 3 to 9, or 3 to 6.\n\n\nAnother factor to consider is the molecular weight of the water-soluble polymer. Generally, the higher the molecular weight of the polymer, the fewer number of polymer molecules which may be attached to the protein. For PEGylation reactions, the typical molecular weight is about 2 kDa to about 100 kDa, about 5 kDa to about 50 kDa, or about 12 kDa to about 25 kDa. The molar ratio of water-soluble polymer to TACI-immunoglobulin will generally be in the range of 1:1 to 100:1. Typically, the molar ratio of water-soluble polymer to TACI-immunoglobulin will be 1:1 to 20:1 for polyPEGylation, and 1:1 to 5:1 for monoPEGylation.\n\n\nGeneral methods for producing conjugates comprising a polypeptide and water-soluble polymer moieties are known in the art. See, for example, Karasiewicz et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,382,657, Greenwald et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,738, 846, Nieforth et al., \nClin. Pharmacol. Ther. \n59:636 (1996), Monkarsh et al., \nAnal. Biochem. \n247:434 (1997)).\n\n\nThe present invention contemplates compositions comprising a peptide or polypeptide described herein. Such compositions can further comprise a carrier. The carrier can be a conventional organic or inorganic carrier. Examples of carriers include water, buffer solution, alcohol, propylene glycol, macrogol, sesame oil, corn oil, and the like.\n\n\n7. Isolation of TACI-Immunoglobulin Polypeptides\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the present invention can be purified to at least about 80% purity, to at least about 90% purity, to at least about 95% purity, or greater than 95% purity with respect to contaminating macromolecules, particularly other proteins and nucleic acids, and free of infectious and pyrogenic agents. The polypeptides of the present invention may also be purified to a pharmaceutically pure state, which is greater than 99.9% pure. In certain preparations, purified polypeptide is substantially free of other polypeptides, particularly other polypeptides of animal origin.\n\n\nFractionation and/or conventional purification methods can be used to obtain preparations of synthetic TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptides, and recombinant TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptides purified from recombinant host cells. In general, ammonium sulfate precipitation and acid or chaotrope extraction may be used for fractionation of samples. Exemplary purification steps may include hydroxyapatite, size exclusion, FPLC and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Suitable chromatographic media include derivatized dextrans, agarose, cellulose, polyacrylamide, specialty silicas, and the like. PEI, DEAE, QAE and Q derivatives are suitable. Exemplary chromatographic media include those media derivatized with phenyl, butyl, or octyl groups, such as Phenyl-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia), Toyopearl butyl 650 (Toso Haas, Montgomeryville, Pa.), Octyl-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and the like; or polyacrylic resins, such as Amberchrom CG 71 (Toso Haas) and the like. Suitable solid supports include glass beads, silica-based resins, cellulosic resins, agarose beads, cross-linked agarose beads, polystyrene beads, cross-linked polyacrylamide resins and the like that are insoluble under the conditions in which they are to be used. These supports may be modified with reactive groups that allow attachment of proteins by amino groups, carboxyl groups, sulfhydryl groups, hydroxyl groups and/or carbohydrate moieties.\n\n\nExamples of coupling chemistries include cyanogen bromide activation, N-hydroxysuccinimide activation, epoxide activation, sulfhydryl activation, hydrazide activation, and carboxyl and amino derivatives for carbodiimide coupling chemistries. These and other solid media are well known and widely used in the art, and are available from commercial suppliers. Selection of a particular method for polypeptide isolation and purification is a matter of routine design and is determined in part by the properties of the chosen support. See, for example, \nAffinity Chromatography: Principles \n& \nMethods \n(Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology 1988), and Doonan, \nProtein Purification Protocols \n(The Humana Press 1996).\n\n\nAdditional variations in TACI-immunoglobulin isolation and purification can be devised by those of skill in the art. For example, anti-TACI or anti-Fc antibodies can be used to isolate large quantities of protein by immunoaffinity purification.\n\n\nThe polypeptides of the present invention can also be isolated by exploitation of particular properties. For example, immobilized metal ion adsorption (IMAC) chromatography can be used to purify histidine-rich proteins, including those comprising polyhistidine tags. Briefly, a gel is first charged with divalent metal ions to form a chelate (Sulkowski, \nTrends in Biochem. \n3:1 (1985)). Histidine-rich proteins will be adsorbed to this matrix with differing affinities, depending upon the metal ion used, and will be eluted by competitive elution, lowering the pH, or use of strong chelating agents. Other methods of purification include purification of glycosylated proteins by lectin affinity chromatography, Protein A chromatography, and ion exchange chromatography (M. Deutscher, (ed.), \nMeth. Enzymol. \n182:529 (1990)).\n\n\nTACI-immunoglobulin polypeptides or fragments thereof may also be prepared through chemical synthesis, as described above. TACI-immunoglobulin polypeptides may be monomers or multimers; glycosylated or non-glycosylated; PEGylated or non-PEGylated; and may or may not include an initial methionine amino acid residue. A TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein may be non-glycosylated, glycosylated, or glycosylated only in the TACI moiety or in the immunoglobulin moiety. The immunoglobulin moiety can be obtained from a human antibody, a chimeric antibody, or a humanized antibody.\n\n\n8. Therapeutic Uses of TACI-Immunoglobulin Polypeptides\n\n\nTACI-immunoglobulin proteins can be used to modulate the immune system by binding ZTNF4 or ZTNF2, and thus, preventing the binding of these ligands with endogenous TACI or BCMA receptors. Accordingly, the present invention includes the use of TACI-immunoglobulin proteins to a subject, which lacks an adequate amount of TACI or BCMA receptors, or which produces an excess of ZTNF4 or ZTNF2. These molecules can be administered to any subject in need of treatment, and the present invention contemplates both veterinary and human therapeutic uses. Illustrative subjects include mammalian subjects, such as farm animals, domestic animals, and human patients.\n\n\nTACI-immunoglobulin polypeptides can be used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, B cell cancers, immunomodulation, IBD and any antibody-mediated pathologies (e.g., ITCP, myasthenia gravis and the like), renal diseases, indirect T cell immune response, graft rejection, and graft versus host disease. The polypeptides of the present invention can be targeted to specifically regulate B cell responses during the immune response. Additionally, the polypeptides of the present invention can be used to modulate B cell development, development of other cells, antibody production, and cytokine production. Polypeptides of the present invention can also modulate T and B cell communication by neutralizing the proliferative effects of ZTNF4.\n\n\nTACI-immunoglobulin polypeptides of the present invention can be useful to neutralize the effects of ZTNF4 for treating pre-B or B-cell leukemias, such as plasma cell leukemia, chronic or acute lymphocytic leukemia, myelomas such as multiple myeloma, plasma cell myeloma, endothelial myeloma and giant cell myeloma, and lymphomas such as non-Hodgkins lymphoma, for which an increase in ZTNF4 polypeptides is associated.\n\n\nZTNF4 is expressed in CD8\n+\n cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, activated monocytes, which indicates that, in certain autoimmune disorders, cytotoxic T-cells might stimulate B-cell production through excess production of ZTNF4. Immunosuppressant proteins that selectively block the action of B-lymphocytes would be of use in treating disease. Autoantibody production is common to several autoimmune diseases and contributes to tissue destruction and exacerbation of disease. Autoantibodies can also lead to the occurrence of immune complex deposition complications and lead to many symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus, including kidney failure, neuralgic symptoms and death. Modulating antibody production independent of cellular response would also be beneficial in many disease states. B cells have also been shown to play a role in the secretion of arthritogenic immunoglobulins in rheumatoid arthritis. As such, inhibition of ZTNF4 antibody production would be beneficial in treatment of autoimmune diseases such as myasthenia gravis, rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular-course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriatic arthritis Immunosuppressant therapeutics such as TACI-immunoglobulin proteins that selectively block or neutralize the action of B-lymphocytes would be useful for such purposes.\n\n\nThe invention provides methods employing TACI-immunoglobulin proteins for selectively blocking or neutralizing the actions of B-cells in association with end stage renal diseases, which may or may not be associated with autoimmune diseases. Such methods would also be useful for treating immunologic renal diseases. Such methods would be would be useful for treating glomerulonephritis associated with diseases such as membranous nephropathy, IgA nephropathy or Berger's Disease, IgM nephropathy, Goodpasture's Disease, post-infectious glomerulonephritis, mesangioproliferative disease, chronic lymphoid leukemia, minimal-change nephrotic syndrome. Such methods would also serve as therapeutic applications for treating secondary glomerulonephritis or vasculitis associated with such diseases as lupus, polyarteritis, Henoch-Schonlein, Scleroderma, HIV-related diseases, amyloidosis or hemolytic uremic syndrome. The methods of the present invention would also be useful as part of a therapeutic application for treating interstitial nephritis or pyelonephritis associated with chronic pyelonephritis, analgesic abuse, nephrocalcinosis, nephropathy caused by other agents, nephrolithiasis, or chronic or acute interstitial nephritis.\n\n\nThe methods of the present invention also include use of TACI-immunoglobulin proteins in the treatment of hypertensive or large vessel diseases, including renal artery stenosis or occlusion and cholesterol emboli or renal emboli.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides methods for treatment of renal or urological neoplasms, multiple myelomas, lymphomas, light chain neuropathy or amyloidosis.\n\n\nThe invention also provides methods for blocking or inhibiting activated B cells using TACI-immunoglobulin proteins for the treatment of asthma and other chronic airway diseases such as bronchitis and emphysema. The TACI-immunoglobulin proteins described herein can also be used to treat Sjögren's Syndrome.\n\n\nAlso provided are methods for inhibiting or neutralizing an effector T cell response using TACI-immunoglobulin proteins for use in immunosuppression, in particular for such therapeutic use as for graft-versus-host disease and graft rejection. Moreover, TACI-immunoglobulin proteins would be useful in therapeutic protocols for treatment of such autoimmune diseases as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and Crohn's Disease. Methods of the present invention would have additional therapeutic value for treating chronic inflammatory diseases, in particular to lessen joint pain, swelling, anemia and other associated symptoms as well as treating septic shock.\n\n\nWell established animal models are available to test in vivo efficacy of TACI-immunoglobulin proteins of the present invention in certain disease states. In particular, TACI-immunoglobulin proteins can be tested in vivo in a number of animal models of autoimmune disease, such as MRL-lpr/lpr or NZB×NZW F1 congenic mouse strains which serve as a model of SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus). Such animal models are known in the art.\n\n\nOffspring of a cross between New Zealand Black (NZB) and New Zealand White (NZW) mice develop a spontaneous form of SLE that closely resembles SLE in humans. The offspring mice, known as NZBW begin to develop IgM autoantibodies against T-cells at 1 month of age, and by 5-7 months of age, Ig anti-DNA autoantibodies are the dominant immunoglobulin. Polyclonal B-cell hyperactivity leads to overproduction of autoantibodies. The deposition of these autoantibodies, particularly ones directed against single stranded DNA is associated with the development of glomerulonephritis, which manifests clinically as proteinuria, azotemia, and death from renal failure. Kidney failure is the leading cause of death in mice affected with spontaneous SLE, and in the NZBW strain, this process is chronic and obliterative. The disease is more rapid and severe in females than males, with mean survival of only 245 days as compared to 406 days for the males. While many of the female mice will be symptomatic (proteinuria) by 7-9 months of age, some can be much younger or older when they develop symptoms. The fatal immune nephritis seen in the NZBW mice is very similar to the glomerulonephritis seen in human SLE, making this spontaneous murine model useful for testing of potential SLE therapeutics.\n\n\nMouse models for experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) has been used as a tool to investigate both the mechanisms of immune-mediated disease, and methods of potential therapeutic intervention. The model resembles human multiple sclerosis, and produces demyelination as a result of T-cell activation to neuroproteins such as myelin basic protein (MBP), or proteolipid protein (PLP). Inoculation with antigen leads to induction of CD4+, class II MHC-restricted T-cells (Th1). Changes in the protocol for EAE can produce acute, chronic-relapsing, or passive-transfer variants of the model.\n\n\nIn the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model, mice develop chronic inflammatory arthritis, which closely resembles human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Since CIA shares similar immunological and pathological features with RA, this makes it an ideal model for screening potential human anti-inflammatory compounds. Another advantage in using the CIA model is that the mechanisms of pathogenesis are known. The T and B cell epitopes on type II collagen have been identified, and various immunological (delayed-type hypersensitivity and anti-collagen antibody) and inflammatory (cytokines, chemokines, and matrix-degrading enzymes) parameters relating to immune-mediating arthritis have been determined, and can be used to assess test compound efficacy in the models.\n\n\nMyasthenia gravis (MG) is another autoimmune disease for which murine models are available. MG is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission involving the production of autoantibodies directed against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). MG is acquired or inherited with clinical features including abnormal weakness and fatigue on exertion. A mouse model of MG has been established. Experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) is an antibody mediated disease characterized by the presence of antibodies to AChR. These antibodies destroy the receptor leading to defective neuromuscular electrical impulses, resulting in muscle weakness. In the EAMG model, mice are immunized with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Clinical signs of MG become evident weeks after the second immunization. EAMG is evaluated by several methods including measuring serum levels of AChR antibodies by radioimmunoassay, measuring muscle AChR, or electromyography.\n\n\nGenerally, the dosage of administered TACI-immunoglobulin protein will vary depending upon such factors as the subject's age, weight, height, sex, general medical condition and previous medical history. Typically, it is desirable to provide the recipient with a dosage of TACI-immunoglobulin protein, which is in the range of from about 1 pg/kg to 10 mg/kg (amount of agent/body weight of subject), although a lower or higher dosage also may be administered as circumstances dictate.\n\n\nAdministration of a TACI-immunoglobulin protein to a subject can be intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intrapleural, intrathecal, by perfusion through a regional catheter, or by direct intralesional injection. When administering therapeutic proteins by injection, the administration may be by continuous infusion or by single or multiple boluses.\n\n\nAdditional routes of administration include oral, mucosal-membrane, pulmonary, and transcutaneous. Oral delivery is suitable for polyester microspheres, zein microspheres, proteinoid microspheres, polycyanoacrylate microspheres, and lipid-based systems (see, for example, DiBase and Morrel, “Oral Delivery of Microencapsulated Proteins,” in \nProtein Delivery: Physical Systems\n, Sanders and Hendren (eds.), pages 255-288 (Plenum Press 1997)). The feasibility of an intranasal delivery is exemplified by such a mode of insulin administration (see, for example, Hinchcliffe and Illum, \nAdv. Drug Deliv. Rev. \n35:199 (1999)). Dry or liquid particles comprising TACI-immunoglobulin can be prepared and inhaled with the aid of dry-powder dispersers, liquid aerosol generators, or nebulizers (e.g., Pettit and Gombotz, \nTIBTECH \n16:343 (1998); Patton et al., \nAdv. Drug Deliv. Rev. \n35:235 (1999)). This approach is illustrated by the AERX diabetes management system, which is a hand-held electronic inhaler that delivers aerosolized insulin into the lungs. Studies have shown that proteins as large as 48,000 kDa have been delivered across skin at therapeutic concentrations with the aid of low-frequency ultrasound, which illustrates the feasibility of transcutaneous administration (Mitragotri et al., \nScience \n269:850 (1995)). Transdermal delivery using electroporation provides another means to administer a TACI-immunoglobulin protein (Potts et al., \nPharm. Biotechnol. \n10:213 (1997)).\n\n\nA pharmaceutical composition comprising a TACI-immunoglobulin protein can be formulated according to known methods to prepare pharmaceutically useful compositions, whereby the therapeutic proteins are combined in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A composition is said to be a “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” if its administration can be tolerated by a recipient patient. Sterile phosphate-buffered saline is one example of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Other suitable carriers are well-known to those in the art. See, for example, Gennaro (ed.), \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n19th Edition (Mack Publishing Company 1995).\n\n\nFor purposes of therapy, TACI-immunoglobulin proteins are administered to a patient in a therapeutically effective amount. A TACI-immunoglobulin protein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is said to be administered in a “therapeutically effective amount” if the amount administered is physiologically significant. An agent is physiologically significant if its presence results in a detectable change in the physiology of a recipient patient. For example, an agent used to treat inflammation is physiologically significant if its presence alleviates the inflammatory response. As another example, an agent used to inhibit the growth of tumor cells is physiologically significant if the administration of the agent results in a decrease in the number of tumor cells, decreased metastasis, a decrease in the size of a solid tumor, or increased necrosis of a tumor. Furthermore, an agent used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus is physiologically significant if the administration of the agent results in a decrease of circulating anti-double stranded DNA antibodies, or a decrease in at least one of the following symptoms: fever, joint pain, erythematosus skin lesions, or other features of systemic lupus erythematosus. One example of a general indication that a TACI-immunoglobulin protein is administered in a therapeutically effective amount is that, following administration to a subject, there is a decrease in circulating levels of ZTNF4 (BLyS).\n\n\nA pharmaceutical composition comprising a TACI-immunoglobulin protein can be furnished in liquid form, in an aerosol, or in solid form. Liquid forms, are illustrated by injectable solutions and oral suspensions. Exemplary solid forms include capsules, tablets, and controlled-release forms. The latter form is illustrated by miniosmotic pumps and implants (Bremer et al., Pharm. Biotechnol. 10:239 (1997); Ranade, “Implants in Drug Delivery,” in Drug Delivery Systems, Ranade and Hollinger (eds.), pages 95-123 (CRC Press 1995); Bremer et al., “Protein Delivery with Infusion Pumps,” in \nProtein Delivery: Physical Systems\n, Sanders and Hendren (eds.), pages 239-254 (Plenum Press 1997); Yewey et al., “Delivery of Proteins from a Controlled Release Injectable Implant,” in \nProtein Delivery: Physical Systems\n, Sanders and Hendren (eds.), pages 93-117 (Plenum Press 1997)).\n\n\nLiposomes provide one means to deliver therapeutic polypeptides to a subject intravenously, intraperitoneally, intrathecally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or via oral administration, inhalation, or intranasal administration. Liposomes are microscopic vesicles that consist of one or more lipid bilayers surrounding aqueous compartments (see, generally, Bakker-Woudenberg et al., \nEur. J. Clin. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. \n12 (\nSuppl. \n1):S61 (1993), Kim, \nDrugs \n46:618 (1993), and Ranade, “Site-Specific Drug Delivery Using Liposomes as Carriers,” in \nDrug Delivery Systems\n, Ranade and Hollinger (eds.), pages 3-24 (CRC Press 1995)). Liposomes are similar in composition to cellular membranes and as a result, liposomes can be administered safely and are biodegradable. Depending on the method of preparation, liposomes may be unilamellar or multilamellar, and liposomes can vary in size with diameters ranging from 0.02 μm to greater than 10 μm. A variety of agents can be encapsulated in liposomes: hydrophobic agents partition in the bilayers and hydrophilic agents partition within the inner aqueous space(s) (see, for example, Machy et al., \nLiposomes In Cell Biology And Pharmacology \n(John Libbey 1987), and Ostro et al., \nAmerican J. Hosp. Pharm. \n46:1576 (1989)). Moreover, it is possible to control the therapeutic availability of the encapsulated agent by varying liposome size, the number of bilayers, lipid composition, as well as the charge and surface characteristics of the liposomes.\n\n\nLiposomes can adsorb to virtually any type of cell and then slowly release the encapsulated agent. Alternatively, an absorbed liposome may be endocytosed by cells that are phagocytic. Endocytosis is followed by intralysosomal degradation of liposomal lipids and release of the encapsulated agents (Scherphof et al., \nAnn. N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n446:368 (1985)). After intravenous administration, small liposomes (0.1 to 1.0 μm) are typically taken up by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, located principally in the liver and spleen, whereas liposomes larger than 3.0 μm are deposited in the lung. This preferential uptake of smaller liposomes by the cells of the reticuloendothelial system has been used to deliver chemotherapeutic agents to macrophages and to tumors of the liver.\n\n\nThe reticuloendothelial system can be circumvented by several methods including saturation with large doses of liposome particles, or selective macrophage inactivation by pharmacological means (Claassen et al., \nBiochim. Biophys. Acta \n802:428 (1984)). In addition, incorporation of glycolipid- or polyethelene glycol-derivatized phospholipids into liposome membranes has been shown to result in a significantly reduced uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (Allen et al., \nBiochim. Biophys. Acta \n1068:133 (1991); Allen et al., \nBiochim. Biophys. Acta \n1150:9 (1993)).\n\n\nLiposomes can also be prepared to target particular cells or organs by varying phospholipid composition or by inserting receptors or ligands into the liposomes. For example, liposomes, prepared with a high content of a nonionic surfactant, have been used to target the liver (Hayakawa et al., Japanese Patent 04-244,018; Kato et al., \nBiol. Pharm. Bull. \n16:960 (1993)). These formulations were prepared by mixing soybean phospatidylcholine, α-tocopherol, and ethoxylated hydrogenated castor oil (HCO-60) in methanol, concentrating the mixture under vacuum, and then reconstituting the mixture with water. A liposomal formulation of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) with a soybean-derived sterylglucoside mixture (SG) and cholesterol (Ch) has also been shown to target the liver (Shimizu et al., \nBiol. Pharm. Bull. \n20:881 (1997)).\n\n\nAlternatively, various targeting ligands can be bound to the surface of the liposome, such as antibodies, antibody fragments, carbohydrates, vitamins, and transport proteins. For example, liposomes can be modified with branched type galactosyllipid derivatives to target asialoglycoprotein (galactose) receptors, which are exclusively expressed on the surface of liver cells (Kato and Sugiyama, \nCrit. Rev. Ther. Drug Carrier Syst. \n14:287 (1997); Murahashi et al., \nBiol. Pharm. Bull.\n20:259 (1997)). Similarly, Wu et al., \nHepatology \n27:772 (1998), have shown that labeling liposomes with asialofetuin led to a shortened liposome plasma half-life and greatly enhanced uptake of asialofetuin-labeled liposome by hepatocytes. On the other hand, hepatic accumulation of liposomes comprising branched type galactosyllipid derivatives can be inhibited by preinjection of asialofetuin (Murahashi et al., \nBiol. Pharm. Bull. \n20:259 (1997)). Polyaconitylated human serum albumin liposomes provide another approach for targeting liposomes to liver cells (Kamps et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n94:11681 (1997)). Moreover, Geho, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,603,044, describe a hepatocyte-directed liposome vesicle delivery system, which has specificity for hepatobiliary receptors associated with the specialized metabolic cells of the liver.\n\n\nIn a more general approach to tissue targeting, target cells are prelabeled with biotinylated antibodies specific for a ligand expressed by the target cell (Harasym et al., \nAdv. Drug Deliv. Rev. \n32:99 (1998)). After plasma elimination of free antibody, streptavidin-conjugated liposomes are administered. In another approach, targeting antibodies are directly attached to liposomes (Harasym et al., \nAdv. Drug Deliv. Rev. \n32:99 (1998)).\n\n\nTACI-immunoglobulin proteins can be encapsulated within liposomes using standard techniques of protein microencapsulation (see, for example, Anderson et al., \nInfect. Immun. \n31:1099 (1981), Anderson et al., \nCancer Res. \n50:1853 (1990), and Cohen et al., \nBiochim. Biophys. Acta \n1063:95 (1991), Alving et al. “Preparation and Use of Liposomes in Immunological Studies,” in \nLiposome Technology, \n2nd Edition, Vol. III, Gregoriadis (ed.), page 317 (CRC Press 1993), Wassef et al., \nMeth. Enzymol. \n149:124 (1987)). As noted above, therapeutically useful liposomes may contain a variety of components. For example, liposomes may comprise lipid derivatives of poly(ethylene glycol) (Allen et al., \nBiochim. Biophys. Acta \n1150:9 (1993)).\n\n\nDegradable polymer microspheres have been designed to maintain high systemic levels of therapeutic proteins. Microspheres are prepared from degradable polymers such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG), polyanhydrides, poly (ortho esters), nonbiodegradable ethylvinyl acetate polymers, in which proteins are entrapped in the polymer (Gombotz and Pettit, \nBioconjugate Chem. \n6:332 (1995); Ranade, “Role of Polymers in Drug Delivery,” in Drug Delivery Systems, Ranade and Hollinger (eds.), pages 51-93 (CRC Press 1995); Roskos and Maskiewicz, “Degradable Controlled Release Systems Useful for Protein Delivery,” in \nProtein Delivery: Physical Systems\n, Sanders and Hendren (eds.), pages 45-92 (Plenum Press 1997); Bartus et al., \nScience \n281:1161 (1998); Putney and Burke, \nNature Biotechnology \n16:153 (1998); Putney, \nCurr. Opin. Chem. Biol. \n2:548 (1998)). Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated nanospheres can also provide carriers for intravenous administration of therapeutic proteins (see, for example, Gref et al., \nPharm. Biotechnol. \n10:167 (1997)).\n\n\nThe present invention also contemplates chemically modified TACI-immunoglobulin proteins in which the polypeptide is linked with a polymer, as discussed above.\n\n\nOther dosage forms can be devised by those skilled in the art, as shown, for example, by Ansel and Popovich, \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, \n5\nth \nEdition (Lea & Febiger 1990), Gennaro (ed.), \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n19\nth \nEdition (Mack Publishing Company 1995), and by Ranade and Hollinger, \nDrug Delivery Systems (CRC Press \n1996).\n\n\nAs an illustration, pharmaceutical compositions may be supplied as a kit comprising a container that comprises a TACI-immunoglobulin protein. Therapeutic polypeptides can be provided in the form of an injectable solution for single or multiple doses, or as a sterile powder that will be reconstituted before injection.\n\n\nAlternatively, such a kit can include a dry-powder disperser, liquid aerosol generator, or nebulizer for administration of a therapeutic polypeptide. Such a kit may further comprise written information on indications and usage of the pharmaceutical composition. Moreover, such information may include a statement that the TACI-immunoglobulin protein composition is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to either the TACI receptor moiety or the immunoglobulin moiety.\n\n\n9. Therapeutic Uses of TACI-Immunoglobulin Nucleotide Sequences\n\n\nThe present invention includes the use of nucleic acid molecules that encode TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins to provide these fusion proteins to a subject in need of such treatment. For veterinary therapeutic use or human therapeutic use, such nucleic acid molecules can be administered to a subject having a disorder or disease, as discussed above. As one example discussed earlier, nucleic acid molecules encoding a TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein can be used for long-term treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n\nThere are numerous approaches for introducing a TACI-immunoglobulin gene to a subject, including the use of recombinant host cells that express TACI-immunoglobulin, delivery of naked nucleic acid encoding TACI-immunoglobulin, use of a cationic lipid carrier with a nucleic acid molecule that encodes TACI-immunoglobulin, and the use of viruses that express TACI-immunoglobulin, such as recombinant retroviruses, recombinant adeno-associated viruses, recombinant adenoviruses, and recombinant Herpes simplex viruses (see, for example, Mulligan, \nScience \n260:926 (1993), Rosenberg et al., \nScience \n242:1575 (1988), LaSalle et al., \nScience \n259:988 (1993), Wolff et al., \nScience \n247:1465 (1990), Breakfield and Deluca, \nThe New Biologist \n3:203 (1991)). In an ex vivo approach, for example, cells are isolated from a subject, transfected with a vector that expresses a TACI-immunoglobulin gene, and then transplanted into the subject.\n\n\nIn order to effect expression of a TACI-immunoglobulin gene, an expression vector is constructed in which a nucleotide sequence encoding a TACI-immunoglobulin gene is operably linked to a core promoter, and optionally a regulatory element, to control gene transcription. The general requirements of an expression vector are described above.\n\n\nAlternatively, a TACI-immunoglobulin gene can be delivered using recombinant viral vectors, including for example, adenoviral vectors (e.g., Kass-Eisler et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n90:11498 (1993), Kolls et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n91:215 (1994), Li et al., \nHum. Gene Ther. \n4:403 (1993), Vincent et al., \nNat. Genet. \n5:130 (1993), and Zabner et al., \nCell \n75:207 (1993)), adenovirus-associated viral vectors (Flotte et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n90:10613 (1993)), alphaviruses such as Semliki Forest Virus and Sindbis Virus (Hertz and Huang, \nJ. Vir. \n66:857 (1992), Raju and Huang, \nJ. Vir. \n65:2501 (1991), and Xiong et al., \nScience \n243:1188 (1989)), herpes viral vectors (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,769,331, 4,859,587, 5,288,641 and 5,328,688), parvovirus vectors (Koering et al., \nHum. Gene Therap. \n5:457 (1994)), pox virus vectors (Ozaki et al., \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. \n193:653 (1993), Panicali and Paoletti, \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n79:4927 (1982)), pox viruses, such as canary pox virus or vaccinia virus (Fisher-Hoch et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n86:317 (1989), and Flexner et al., \nAnn. N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n569:86 (1989)), and retroviruses (e.g., Baba et al., \nJ. Neurosurg \n79:729 (1993), Ram et al., \nCancer Res. \n \n\n\n53:83 (1993), Takamiya et al., \nJ. Neurosci. Res \n33:493 (1992), Vile and Hart, \nCancer Res. \n53:962 (1993), Vile and Hart, \nCancer Res. \n53:3860 (1993), and Anderson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,346). Within various embodiments, either the viral vector itself, or a viral particle, which contains the viral vector may be utilized in the methods and compositions described below.\n\n\nAs an illustration of one system, adenovirus, a double-stranded DNA virus, is a well-characterized gene transfer vector for delivery of a heterologous nucleic acid molecule (for a review, see Becker et al., \nMeth. Cell Biol. \n43:161 (1994); Douglas and Curiel, \nScience \n& \nMedicine \n4:44 (1997)). The adenovirus system offers several advantages including: (i) the ability to accommodate relatively large DNA inserts, (ii) the ability to be grown to high-titer, (iii) the ability to infect a broad range of mammalian cell types, and (iv) the ability to be used with many different promoters including ubiquitous, tissue specific, and regulatable promoters. In addition, adenoviruses can be administered by intravenous injection, because the viruses are stable in the bloodstream.\n\n\nUsing adenovirus vectors where portions of the adenovirus genome are deleted, inserts are incorporated into the viral DNA by direct ligation or by homologous recombination with a co-transfected plasmid. In an exemplary system, the essential E1 gene is deleted from the viral vector, and the virus will not replicate unless the E1 gene is provided by the host cell. When intravenously administered to intact animals, adenovirus primarily targets the liver. Although an adenoviral delivery system with an E1 gene deletion cannot replicate in the host cells, the host's tissue will express and process an encoded heterologous protein. Host cells will also secrete the heterologous protein if the corresponding gene includes a secretory signal sequence. Secreted proteins will enter the circulation from tissue that expresses the heterologous gene (e.g., the highly vascularized liver).\n\n\nMoreover, adenoviral vectors containing various deletions of viral genes can be used to reduce or eliminate immune responses to the vector. Such adenoviruses are E1-deleted, and in addition, contain deletions of E2A or E4 (Lusky et al., \nJ. Virol. \n72:2022 (1998); Raper et al., \nHuman Gene Therapy \n9:671 (1998)). The deletion of E2b has also been reported to reduce immune responses (Amalfitano et al., \nJ. Virol. \n72:926 (1998)). By deleting the entire adenovirus genome, very large inserts of heterologous DNA can be accommodated. Generation of so called “gutless” adenoviruses, where all viral genes are deleted, are particularly advantageous for insertion of large inserts of heterologous DNA (for a review, see Yeh. and Perricaudet, \nFASEB J. \n11:615 (1997)).\n\n\nHigh titer stocks of recombinant viruses capable of expressing a therapeutic gene can be obtained from infected mammalian cells using standard methods. For example, recombinant herpes simplex virus can be prepared in Vero cells, as described by Brandt et al., \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n72:2043 (1991), Herold et al., \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n75:1211 (1994), Visalli and Brandt, \nVirology \n185:419 (1991), Grau et al., \nInvest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. \n30:2474 (1989), Brandt et al., \nJ. Virol. Meth. \n36:209 (1992), and by Brown and MacLean (eds.), \nHSV Virus Protocols \n(Humana Press 1997).\n\n\nAlternatively, an expression vector comprising a TACI-immunoglobulin gene can be introduced into a subject's cells by lipofection in vivo using liposomes. Synthetic cationic lipids can be used to prepare liposomes for in vivo transfection of a gene encoding a marker (Felgner et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n84:7413 (1987); Mackey et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n85:8027 (1988)). The use of lipofection to introduce exogenous genes into specific organs in vivo has certain practical advantages. Liposomes can be used to direct transfection to particular cell types, which is particularly advantageous in a tissue with cellular heterogeneity, such as the pancreas, liver, kidney, and brain. Lipids may be chemically coupled to other molecules for the purpose of targeting. Targeted peptides (e.g., hormones or neurotransmitters), proteins such as antibodies, or non-peptide molecules can be coupled to liposomes chemically.\n\n\nElectroporation is another alternative mode of administration. For example, Aihara and Miyazaki, \nNature Biotechnology \n16:867 (1998), have demonstrated the use of in vivo electroporation for gene transfer into muscle.\n\n\nIn general, the dosage of a composition comprising a therapeutic vector having a TACI-immunoglobulin nucleotide acid sequence, such as a recombinant virus, will vary depending upon such factors as the subject's age, weight, height, sex, general medical condition and previous medical history. Suitable routes of administration of therapeutic vectors include intravenous injection, intraarterial injection, intraperitoneal injection, intramuscular injection, intratumoral injection, and injection into a cavity that contains a tumor. As an illustration, Horton et al., \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n96:1553 (1999), demonstrated that intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA encoding interferon-α produces potent antitumor effects on primary and metastatic tumors in a murine model.\n\n\nA composition comprising viral vectors, non-viral vectors, or a combination of viral and non-viral vectors of the present invention can be formulated according to known methods to prepare pharmaceutically useful compositions, whereby vectors or viruses are combined in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As noted above, a composition, such as phosphate-buffered saline is said to be a “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” if its administration can be tolerated by a recipient subject. Other suitable carriers are well-known to those in the art (see, for example, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n19th Ed. (Mack Publishing Co. 1995), and Gilman's the \nPharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, \n7\nth Ed\n. (MacMillan Publishing Co. 1985)).\n\n\nFor purposes of therapy, a therapeutic gene expression vector, or a recombinant virus comprising such a vector, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are administered to a subject in a therapeutically effective amount. A combination of an expression vector (or virus) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is said to be administered in a “therapeutically effective amount” if the amount administered is physiologically significant. An agent is physiologically significant if its presence results in a detectable change in the physiology of a recipient subject. For example, an agent used to treat inflammation is physiologically significant if its presence alleviates the inflammatory response. As another example, an agent used to inhibit the growth of tumor cells is physiologically significant if the administration of the agent results in a decrease in the number of tumor cells, decreased metastasis, a decrease in the size of a solid tumor, or increased necrosis of a tumor.\n\n\nWhen the subject treated with a therapeutic gene expression vector or a recombinant virus is a human, then the therapy is preferably somatic cell gene therapy. That is, the preferred treatment of a human with a therapeutic gene expression vector or a recombinant virus does not entail introducing into cells a nucleic acid molecule that can form part of a human germ line and be passed onto successive generations (i.e., human germ line gene therapy).\n\n\n10. Production of Transgenic Mice\n\n\nTransgenic mice can be engineered to over-express nucleic acid sequences encoding TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins in all tissues, or under the control of a tissue-specific or tissue-preferred regulatory element. These over-producers of TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins can be used to characterize the phenotype that results from over-expression, and the transgenic animals can serve as models for human disease caused by excess TACI receptor protein. Transgenic mice that over-express TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins also provide model bioreactors for production of TACI-immunoglobulin fusion proteins in the milk or blood of larger animals. Methods for producing transgenic mice are well-known to those of skill in the art (see, for example, Jacob, “Expression and Knockout of Interferons in Transgenic Mice,” in \nOverexpression and Knockout of Cytokines in Transgenic Mice\n, Jacob (ed.), pages 111-124 (Academic Press, Ltd. 1994), Monastersky and Robl (eds.), \nStrategies in Transgenic Animal Science \n(ASM Press 1995), and Abbud and Nilson, “Recombinant Protein Expression in Transgenic Mice,” in \nGene Expression \n \n\n\nSystems: Using Nature for the Art of Expression, Fernandez and Hoeffler (eds.), pages 367-397 (Academic Press, Inc. 1999)).\n\n\nFor example, a method for producing a transgenic mouse that expresses a nucleic acid sequence that encodes a TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein can begin with adult, fertile males (studs) (B6C3f1, 2 to 8 months of age (Taconic Farms, Germantown, N.Y.)), vasectomized males (duds) (B6D2f1, 2 to 8 months, (Taconic Farms)), prepubescent fertile females (donors) (B6C3f1, 4 to 5 weeks, (Taconic Farms)) and adult fertile females (recipients) (B6D2f1, 2 to 4 months, (Taconic Farms)). The donors are acclimated for one week and then injected with approximately 8 IU/mouse of Pregnant Mare's Serum gonadotrophin (Sigma Chemical Company; St. Louis, Mo.) I.P., and 46-47 hours later, 8 IU/mouse of human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG (Sigma)) I.P. to induce superovulation. Donors are mated with studs subsequent to hormone injections. Ovulation generally occurs within 13 hours of hCG injection. Copulation is confirmed by the presence of a vaginal plug the morning following mating.\n\n\nFertilized eggs are collected under a surgical scope. The oviducts are collected and eggs are released into urinanalysis slides containing hyaluronidase (Sigma). Eggs are washed once in hyaluronidase, and twice in Whitten's W640 medium (described, for example, by Menino and O′Claray, \nBiol. Reprod. \n77:159 (1986), and Dienhart and Downs, \nZygote \n4:129 (1996)) that has been incubated with 5% CO\n2\n, 5% O\n2\n, and 90% N\n2 \nat 37° C. The eggs are then stored in a 37° C./5% CO\n2 \nincubator until microinjection.\n\n\nTen to twenty micrograms of plasmid DNA containing a TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein encoding sequence is linearized, gel-purified, and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), at a final concentration of 5-10 nanograms per microliter for microinjection. For example, the TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein encoding sequences can encode a TACI polypeptide with deletion of amino acid residues 1 to 29 and 111 to 154 of SEQ ID NO:2, and an Fc5 immunoglobulin moiety.\n\n\nPlasmid DNA is microinjected into harvested eggs contained in a drop of W640 medium overlaid by warm, CO\n2\n-equilibrated mineral oil. The DNA is drawn into an injection needle (pulled from a 0.75 mm ID, 1 mm OD borosilicate glass capillary), and injected into individual eggs. Each egg is penetrated with the injection needle, into one or both of the haploid pronuclei.\n\n\nPicoliters of DNA are injected into the pronuclei, and the injection needle withdrawn without coming into contact with the nucleoli. The procedure is repeated until all the eggs are injected. Successfully microinjected eggs are transferred into an organ tissue-culture dish with pre-gassed W640 medium for storage overnight in a 37° C./5% CO\n2 \nincubator.\n\n\nThe following day, two-cell embryos are transferred into pseudopregnant recipients. The recipients are identified by the presence of copulation plugs, after copulating with vasectomized duds. Recipients are anesthetized and shaved on the dorsal left side and transferred to a surgical microscope. A small incision is made in the skin and through the muscle wall in the middle of the abdominal area outlined by the ribcage, the saddle, and the hind leg, midway between knee and spleen. The reproductive organs are exteriorized onto a small surgical drape. The fat pad is stretched out over the surgical drape, and a baby serrefine (Roboz, Rockville, Md.) is attached to the fat pad and left hanging over the back of the mouse, preventing the organs from sliding back in.\n\n\nWith a fine transfer pipette containing mineral oil followed by alternating W640 and air bubbles, 12-17 healthy two-cell embryos from the previous day's injection are transferred into the recipient. The swollen ampulla is located and holding the oviduct between the ampulla and the bursa, a nick in the oviduct is made with a 28 g needle close to the bursa, making sure not to tear the ampulla or the bursa.\n\n\nThe pipette is transferred into the nick in the oviduct, and the embryos are blown in, allowing the first air bubble to escape the pipette. The fat pad is gently pushed into the peritoneum, and the reproductive organs allowed to slide in. The peritoneal wall is closed with one suture and the skin closed with a wound clip. The mice recuperate on a 37° C. slide warmer for a minimum of four hours.\n\n\nThe recipients are returned to cages in pairs, and allowed 19-21 days gestation. After birth, 19-21 days postpartum is allowed before weaning. The weanlings are sexed and placed into separate sex cages, and a 0.5 cm biopsy (used for genotyping) is snipped off the tail with clean scissors.\n\n\nGenomic DNA is prepared from the tail snips using, for example, a QIAGEN DNEASY kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Genomic DNA is analyzed by PCR using primers designed to amplify a nucleic acid sequence encoding a TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein or a selectable marker gene that was introduced in the same plasmid. After animals are confirmed to be transgenic, they are back-crossed into an inbred strain by placing a transgenic female with a wild-type male, or a transgenic male with one or two wild-type female(s). As pups are born and weaned, the sexes are separated, and their tails snipped for genotyping.\n\n\nTo check for expression of a transgene in a live animal, a partial hepatectomy is performed. A surgical prep is made of the upper abdomen directly below the zyphoid process. Using sterile technique, a small 1.5-2 cm incision is made below the sternum and the left lateral lobe of the liver exteriorized. Using 4-0 silk, a tie is made around the lower lobe securing it outside the body cavity. An atraumatic clamp is used to hold the tie while a second loop of absorbable Dexon (American Cyanamid; Wayne, N.J.) is placed proximal to the first tie. A distal cut is made from the Dexon tie and approximately 100 mg of the excised liver tissue is placed in a sterile petri dish. The excised liver section is transferred to a 14 ml polypropylene round bottom tube and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored on dry ice. The surgical site is closed with suture and wound clips, and the animal's cage placed on a 37° C. heating pad for 24 hours post operatively. The animal is checked daily post operatively and the wound clips removed 7-10 days after surgery. The expression level of TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein mRNA is examined for each transgenic mouse using an RNA solution hybridization assay or polymerase chain reaction.\n\n\nUsing the general approach described above, transgenic mice have been produced that express significant levels of TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein in milk. In this particular case, the TACI-immunoglobulin fusion protein encoding sequence encoded a TACI polypeptide with deletion of amino acid residues 1 to 29 and 111 to 154 of SEQ ID NO:2, and an Fc5 immunoglobulin moiety.\n\n\nThe present invention, thus generally described, will be understood more readily by reference to the following examples, which are provided by way of illustration and is not intended to be limiting of the present invention.\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nConstruction of Nucleic Acid Molecules that Encode TACI-Fc Proteins\n\n\nNucleic acid molecules encoding human TACI were obtained during the expression cloning of the receptors for ZTNF4 as described by Gross et al., \nNature \n404:995 (2000). The coding sequences contained in the TACI-Fc expression constructs were generated by overlap PCR, using standard techniques (see, for example, Horton et al., \nGene \n77:61 (1989)). Human TACI cDNA and Fc cDNA were used as starting templates for the PCR amplifications. PCR primers were designed to yield the desired coding sequence 5′ and 3′ ends and to introduce restriction enzyme recognition sites to facilitate insertion of these coding sequences into the expression vectors. The TACI-Fc coding sequences were inserted into expression vectors that included a functional murine dihydrofolate reductase gene. One expression vector also contained a cytomegalovirus promoter to direct the expression of the recombinant protein transgene, an immunoglobulin intron, a tissue plasminogen activator signal sequence, an internal ribosome entry sequence, a deleted CD8 cistron for surface selection of transfected cells, and yeast expression elements for growth of the plasmid in yeast cells.\n\n\nOne approach that was used to produce TACI-Fc fusion proteins is illustrated by the method used to construct TACI-Fc4. Other TACI-Fc fusion proteins were produced by inserting nucleotide sequences that encode a TACI-Fc fusion protein into a mammalian expression vector, and introducing that expression vector into mammalian cells.\n\n\nA. Ig γ1 Fc4 Fragment Construction\n\n\nTo prepare the TACI-Fc4 fusion protein, the Fc region of human IgG1 (the hinge region and the CH\n2 \nand CH\n3 \ndomains) was modified to remove Fcγ1 receptor (FcγRI) and complement (C1q) binding functions. This modified version of human IgG1 Fc was designated “Fc4.”\n\n\nThe Fc region was isolated from a human fetal liver library (Clontech) PCR using oligo primers 5′ ATCAGCGGAA TTCAGATCTT CAGACAAAAC TCACACATGC CCAC 3′ (SEQ ID NO:7) and 5′ GGCAGTCTCT AGATCATTTA CCCGGAGACA GGGAG 3′ (SEQ ID NO:8). Mutations within the Fc region were introduced by PCR to reduce FcγRI binding. The FcγRI binding site (Leu-Leu-Gly-Gly; amino acid residues 38 to 41 of SEQ ID NO:6, which correspond to EU index positions 234 to 237) was mutated to Ala-Glu-Gly-Ala to reduce FcγR1 binding (see, for example, Duncan et al., \nNature \n332:563 (1988); Baum et al., \nEMBO J. \n13:3992 (1994)). Oligonucleotide primers 5′ CCGTGCCCAG CACCTGAAGC CGAGGGGGCA CCGTCAGTCT TCCTCTTCCC C 3′ (SEQ ID NO:9) and 5′ GGATTCTAGA TTATTTACCC GGAGACAGGG A 3′ (SEQ ID NO:10) were used to introduce the mutation. To a 50 μl final volume was added 570 ng of IgFc template, 5 μl of 10× Pfu reaction Buffer (Stratagene), 8 μl of 1.25 mM dNTPs, 31 μl of distilled water, 2 μl of 20 mM oligonucleotide primers. An equal volume of mineral oil was added and the reaction was heated to 94° C. for 1 minute. Pfu polymerase (2.5 units, Stratagene) was added followed by 25 cycles at 94° C. for 30 seconds, 55° C. for 30 seconds, 72° C. for 1 minute followed by a 7 minute extension at 72° C. The reaction products were fractioned by electrophoresis, and the band corresponding to the predicted size of about 676 base pairs was detected. This band was excised from the gel and recovered using a QIAGEN QIAquick™ Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nPCR was also used to introduce a mutation of Ala to Ser (amino acid residue 134 of SEQ ID NO:6, which corresponds to EU index position 330) and Pro to Ser (amino acid residue 135 of SEQ ID NO:6, which corresponds to EU index position 331) to reduce complement C1q binding or complement fixation (Duncan and Winter, \nNature \n332:788 (1988)). Two first round reactions were performed using the FcγRI binding side-mutated IgFc sequence as a template. To a 50 μl final volume was added 1 μl of FcγRI binding site mutated IgFc template, 5 μl of 10× Pfu Reaction Buffer (Stratagene), 8 μl of 1.25 mM dNTPs, 31 of μl distilled water, 2 μl of 20 mM 5′ GGTGGCGGCT CCCAGATGGG TCCTGTCCGA GCCCAGATCT TCAGACAAAA CTCAC 3′ (SEQ ID NO:11), a 5′ primer beginning at nucleotide 36 of SEQ ID NO:5, and 2 μl of 20 mM 5′ TGGGAGGGCT TTGTTGGA 3′ (SEQ ID NO:12), a 3′ primer beginning at the complement of nucleotide 405 of SEQ ID NO:5. The second reaction contained 2 μl each of 20 mM stocks of oligonucleotide primers 5′ TCCAACAAAG CCCTCCCATC CTCCATCGAG AAAACCATCT CC 3′ (SEQ ID NO:13), a 5′ primer beginning at nucleotide 388 of SEQ ID NO:5 and 5′ GGATGGATCC ATGAAGCACC TGTGGTTCTT CCTCCTGCTG GTGGCGGCTC CCAGATG 3′ (SEQ ID NO:14), a 3′ primer, to introduce the Ala to Ser mutation, XbaI restriction site and stop codon. An equal volume of mineral oil was added and the reactions were heated to 94° C. for 1 minute. Pfu polymerase (2.5 units, Stratagene) was added followed by 25 cycles at 94° C. for 30 seconds, 55° C. for 30 seconds, 72° C. for 2 minutes followed by a 7 minute extension at 72° C. The reaction products were fractionated by electrophoresis, and bands corresponding to the predicted sizes, about 370 and about 395 base pairs respectively, were detected. The bands were excised from the gel and extracted using a QIAGEN QIAquick™ Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nA second round reaction was performed to join the above fragments and add the 5′ BamHI restriction site and a signal sequence from the human immunoglobulin JBL 2′C\nL \nheavy chain variable region (Cogne et al., \nEur. J. Immunol. \n18:1485 (1988)). To a 50 μl final volume was added 30 μl of distilled water, 8 μl of 1.25 mM dNTPs, 5 μ1 of 10× Pfu polymerase reaction buffer (Stratagene) and 1 μl each of the two first two PCR products. An equal volume of mineral oil was added and the reaction was heated to 94° C. for 1 minute. Pfu polymerase (2.5 units, Stratagene) was added followed by 5 cycles at 94° C. for 30 seconds, 55° C. for 30 seconds, and 72° C. for 2 minutes. The temperature was again brought to 94° C. and 2 μl each of 20 mM stocks of 5′ GGATGGATCC ATGAAGCACC TGTGGTTCTT CCTCCTGCTG GTGGCGGCTC CCAGATG 3′ (SEQ ID NO:14), a 5′ primer beginning at nucleotide 1 of SEQ ID NO:5, and 5′ GGATTCTAGA TTATTTACCC GGAGACAGGG A 3′ (SEQ ID NO:10) were added followed by 25 cycles at 94° C. for 30 seconds, 55° C. for 30 seconds and 72° C. for 2 minutes, and a final 7 minute extension at 72° C. A portion of the reaction was visualized using gel electrophoresis. A 789 base pair band corresponding the predicted size was detected.\n\n\nB. TACI-Fc4 Expression Vector Construction\n\n\nExpression plasmids comprising a coding region for TACI-Fc4 fusion protein were constructed via homologous recombination in yeast. A fragment of TACI cDNA was isolated using PCR that included the polynucleotide sequence from nucleotide 14 to nucleotide 475 of SEQ ID NO:1. The two primers used in the production of the TACI fragment were: (1) a primer containing 40 base pairs of the 5′ vector flanking sequence and 17 base pairs corresponding to the amino terminus of the TACI fragment (5′ CTCAGCCAGG AAATCCATGC CGAGTTGAGA CGCTTCCGTA GAATGAGTGG CCTGGGCCG 3; SEQ ID NO:15); (2) 40 base pairs of the 3′ end corresponding to the flanking Fc4 sequence and 17 base pairs corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the TACI fragment (5′ GCATGTGTGA GTTTTGTCTG AAGATCTGGG CTCCTTCAGC CCCGGGAG 3; SEQ ID NO:16). To a 100 μl final volume was added 10 ng of TACI template, 10 μl of 10× Taq polymerase Reaction Buffer (Perkin Elmer), 8 μl of 2.5 nM dNTPs, 78 μl of distilled water, 2 μl each of 20 mM stocks of the oligonucleotide primers, and Taq polymerase (2.5 units, Life Technology). An equal volume of mineral oil was added and the reaction was heated to 94° C. for 2 minutes, followed by 25 cycles at 94° C. for 30 seconds, 65° C. for 30 seconds, 65° C. for 30 seconds, 72° C. for 1 minute followed by a 5 minute extension at 72° C.\n\n\nThe fragment containing the cDNA encoding the Fc4 fragment was constructed in a similar manner. The two primers used in the production of the Fc4 fragment were (upstream and downstream), an oligonucleotide primer containing 40 base pairs of the 5′ TACI flanking sequence and 17 base pairs corresponding to the amino terminus of the Fc4 fragment (5′ GCACAGAGGC TCAGAAGCAA GTCCAGCTCT CCCGGGGCTG AAGGAGCCCA GATCTTCAGA 3; SEQ ID NO:17); and an oligonucleotide primer containing 40 base pairs of the 3′ end corresponding to the flanking vector sequence and 17 base pairs corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the Fc4 fragment (5′ GGGGTGGGTA CAACCCCAGA GCTGTTTTAA TCTAGATTAT TTACCCGGAG ACAGGG 3; SEQ ID NO:18). To a 100 μl final volume was added 10 ng of Fc4 template described above, 10 \nμl\n 10×\n\n\nTaq polymerase Reaction Buffer (Perkin Elmer), 8 μl of 2.5 nM dNTPs, 78 μl of distilled water, 2 μl each of 20 mM stocks of the oligonucleotides, and Taq polymerase (2.5 units, Life Technology). An equal volume of mineral oil was added and the reaction was heated to 94° C. for 2 minutes, then 25 cycles at 94° C. for 30 seconds, 65° C. for30 seconds, 72° C. for 1 minute followed by a 5 minute extension at 72° C.\n\n\nTen microliters of each of the 100 μl PCR reactions described above were run on a 0.8% LMP agarose gel (Seaplaque GTG) with 1× TBE buffer for analysis. The remaining 90 μl of each PCR reaction was precipitated with the addition of 5 μl of 1 M sodium chloride and 250 μl of absolute ethanol. The plasmid pZMP6 was cleaved with SmaI to linearize it at the polylinker. Plasmid pZMP6 was derived from the plasmid pCZR199 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va., ATCC#98668) and is a mammalian expression vector containing an expression cassette having the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter, a consensus intron from the variable region of mouse immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, multiple restriction sites for insertion of coding sequences, a stop codon and a human growth hormone terminator. The plasmid also has an \nE. coli \norigin of replication, a mammalian selectable marker expression unit having an SV40 promoter, enhancer and origin of replication, a dihydrofolate reductase gene and the SV40 terminator. The vector pZMP6 was constructed from pCZR199 by replacement of the metallothionein promoter with the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter, and the Kozac sequences at the 5′ end of the open reading frame.\n\n\nOne hundred microliters of competent yeast cells (\nS. cerevisiae\n) were combined with 10 μl containing approximately 1 μg of the TACI extracellular domain and the Fc4 PCR fragments, and 100 ng of SmaI digested pZMP6 vector and transferred to a 0.2 cm electroporation cuvette. The yeast/DNA mixtures were electropulsed at 0.75 kV (5 kV/cm), ∞ ohms, 25 μF. To each cuvette was added 600 μl of 1.2 M sorbitol and the yeast were plated in two 300 μl aliquots onto to URA-D plates and incubated at 30° C.\n\n\nAfter about 48 hours, the Ura+yeast transformants from a single plate were resuspended in 1 ml of water and spun briefly to pellet the yeast cells. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Five hundred microliters of the lysis mixture was added to an Eppendorf tube containing 300 μl acid washed glass beads and 200 μl phenol-chloroform, vortexed for 1 minute intervals two or three times, followed by a 5 minute spin in a Eppendorf centrifuge at maximum speed. Three hundred microliters of the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube, and the DNA precipitated with 600 μl of ethanol, followed by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 4° C. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of water.\n\n\nTransformation of electrocompetent \nE. coli \ncells (DH10B, GibcoBRL) was performed with 0.5-2 ml yeast DNA prep and 40 μl of DH10B cells. The cells were electropulsed at 2.0 kV, 25 mF and 400 ohms Following electroporation, 1 ml of SOC (2% Bacto-Tryptone (Difco, Detroit, Mich.), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco), 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM MgSO\n4\n, 20 mM glucose) were plated in 250 μl aliquots on four LB AMP plates (LB broth (Lennox), 1.8% Bacto-Agar (Difco), 100 mg/L Ampicillin).\n\n\nIndividual clones harboring the correct expression construct for TACI-Fc4 were identified by restriction digest to verify the presence of the insert and to confirm that the various DNA sequences have been joined correctly to one another. The insert of positive clones were subjected to sequence analysis. Larger scale plasmid DNA is isolated using the Qiagen Maxi kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nC. Construction of Fc5, Fc6, and Fc7\n\n\nIn Fc5, the Arg residue at \nEU index position\n 218 was changed back to a Lys residue. Wild-type human Ig γ1 contains a lysine at this position. Briefly, nucleic acid molecules encoding Fc5 were produced using oligonucleotide primers 5′ GAGCCCAAATCTTCAGACAAAACTCACACATGCCCA 3′ (SEQ ID NO:19) and 5′ TAATTGGCGCGCCTCTAGATTATTTACCCGGAGACA 3′ (SEQ ID NO:20). The conditions of the PCR amplification were as follows. To a 50 μl final volume was added 236 ng of Fc4 template, 5 μl of 10 Pfu reaction Buffer (Stratagene), 4 μl of 2.5 mM dNTPs, 1 pa of 20 μM of each of the oligonucleotides, and 1 μl of Pfu polymerase (2.5 units, Stratagene). The amplification thermal profile consisted of 94° C. for 2 minutes, 5 cycles at 94° C. for 15 seconds, 42° C. for 20 seconds, 72° C. for 45 seconds, 20 cycles at 94° C. for 15 seconds, 72° C. for 1 \nminute\n 20 seconds, followed by a 7 minute extension at 72° C. The reaction product was fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the band corresponding to the predicted size of about 718 base pairs was detected. The band was excised from the gel and recovered using a QIAGEN QlAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nFc6 is identical to Fc5 except that the carboxyl terminal lysine codon has been eliminated. As in Fc4 and Fc5 above, the stop codon in the Fc6 sequence was changed to TAA. Fc6 was generated from template DNA that encoded Fc5 using oligonucleotide primers 5′ GAGCCCAAAT CTTCAGACAA AACTCACACA TGCCCA 3′ (SEQ ID NO:19) and 5′ GGCGCGCCTC TAGATTAACC CGGAGACAGG GAGAGGC 3′ (SEQ ID NO:21).\n\n\nFc7 is identical to the wild-type γ1 Fc except for an amino acid substitution at EU \nindex position Asn\n 297 located in the C\nH\n2 domain. \nAsn\n 297 was mutated to a Gln residue to prevent the attachment of N-linked carbohydrate at that residue position. As above, the stop codon in the Fc7 sequence was changed to TAA. Fc7 was generated by overlap PCR using a wild-type human IgGγ1 Fc cDNA as the template and oligonucleotide primers 5′ GAGCCCAAATCTTGCGACAAAACTCACA 3′ (SEQ ID NO:22) and 5′ GTACGTGCTTTGGTACTGCTCCTCCCGCGGCTT 3′ (SEQ ID NO:23) to generate the 5′ half of Fc7, and oligonucleotide primers 5′ CAGTACCAAAGCACGTACCGTGTGGTCA 3′ (SEQ ID NO:24) and 5′ TAATTGGCGCGCCTCTAGATTATTTACCCGGAGACA 3′ (SEQ ID NO:20) to generate the 3′ half of Fc7. The two PCR products were combined and amplified using oligonucleotide primers 5′ GAGCCCAAATCTTGCGACAAAACTCACA 3′ (SEQ ID NO:22) and 5′ TAATTGGCGCGCCTCTAGATTATTTACCCGGAGACA 3′ (SEQ ID NO:20).\n\n\nAll the resultant PCR products were gel purified, cloned, and verified by DNA sequence analysis.\n\n\nD. Construction of Amino-Truncated TACI-Fc Fusion Proteins\n\n\nFour amino terminal truncated versions of TACI-Fc were generated. All four had a modified human tissue plasminogen activator signal sequence (SEQ ID NO:25) fused to amino \nacid residue number\n 30 of SEQ ID NO:2. However, the four proteins differed in the location of point in which the Fc5 was fused to the TACI amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2.

The two reactions were performed separately using the 5′and 3′ TACI oligonucleotides in one reaction, and the 5′ and 3′ Fc5 oligonucleotides in another reaction for each version. The conditions of the first round PCR amplification were as follows. To a 25 μl final volume was added approximately 200 ng template DNA, 2.5 μl 10× Pfu reaction Buffer (Stratagene), 2 μl of 2.5 mM dNTPs, 0.5 μl of 20 μM each 5′ oligonucleotide and 3′ oligonucleotide, and 0.5 μl Pfu polymerase (2.5 units, Stratagene). The amplification thermal profile consisted of 94° C. for 3 minutes, 35 cycles at 94° C. for 15 seconds, 50° C. for 15 seconds, 72° C. for 2 minutes, followed by a 2 minute extension at 72° C. The reaction products were fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the bands corresponding to the predicted sizes were excised from the gel and recovered using a QIAGEN QIAQUICK Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nThe second round of PCR amplification, or overlap PCR amplification reaction, was performed using the gel purified fragments from the first round PCR as DNA template. The conditions of the second round PCR amplification were as follows. To a 25 μl final volume was added approximately 10 ng template DNA each of the TACI fragment and the Fc5 fragment, 2.5 μl 10× Pfu reaction Buffer (Stratagene), 2 μl of 2.5 mM dNTPs, 0.5 μl of 20 μM each ZC24,903 (SEQ ID NO:40) and ZC24,946 (SEQ ID NO:20) and 0.5 μl Pfu polymerase (2.5 units, Stratagene). The amplification thermal profile consisted of 94° C. for 1 minute, 35 cycles at 94° C. for 15 seconds, 55° C. for 15 seconds, 72° C. for 2 minutes, followed by a 2 minute extension at 72° C. The reaction products were fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the bands corresponding to the predicted sizes were excised from the gel and recovered using a QIAGEN QIAQUICK Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nEach of the four versions of the amino terminal truncated TACI-Fc PCR products were separately cloned using Invitrogen's ZEROBLUNT TOPO PCR Cloning Kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol.

The FseI-AscI fragments were ligated into a mammalian expression vector containing a CMV promoter and an SV40 poly A segment. Expression vectors were introduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells as described below.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nProduction of TACI-Fc Proteins by Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells\n\n\nThe TACI-Fc expression constructs were used to transfect, via electroporation, suspension-adapted Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) DG44 cells grown in animal protein-free medium (Urlaub et al., \nSom. Cell. Molec. Genet. \n12:555 (1986)). CHO\n\n\nDG44 cells lack a functional dihydrofolate reductase gene due to deletions at both dihydrofolate reductase chromosomal locations. Growth of the cells in the presence of increased concentrations of methotrexate results in the amplification of the dihydrofolate reductase gene, and the linked recombinant protein-encoded gene on the expression construct.\n\n\nCHO DG44 cells were passaged in PFCHO media (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), 4 mM L-Glutamine (JRH Biosciences), and 1× hypothanxine-thymidine supplement (Life Technologies), and the cells were incubated at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nin Corning shake flasks at 120 RPM on a rotating shaker platform. The cells were transfected separately with linearized expression plasmids. To ensure sterility, a single ethanol precipitation step was performed on ice for 25 minutes by combining 200 μg of plasmid DNA in an Eppendorf tube with 20 μl of sheared salmon sperm carrier DNA (5′→3′ Inc. Boulder, Colo., 10 mg/ml), 22 μl of 3M NaOAc (pH 5.2), and 484 μl of 100% ethanol (Gold Shield Chemical Co., Hayward, Calif.). After incubation, the tube was centrifuged at 14,000 RPM in a microfuge placed in a 4° C. cold room, the supernatant removed and the pellet washed twice with 0.5 ml of 70% ethanol and allowed to air dry.\n\n\nThe CHO DG44 cells were prepared while the DNA pellet was drying by centrifuging 10\n6 \ntotal cells (16.5 ml) in a 25 ml conical centrifuge tube at 900 RPM for 5 minutes. The CHO DG44 cells were resuspended into a total volume of 300 μl of PFCHO growth media, and placed in a Gene-Pulser Cuvette with a 0.4 cm electrode gap (Bio-Rad). The DNA, after approximately 50 minutes of drying time, was resuspended into 500 μl of PFCHO growth media and added to the cells in the cuvette so that the total volume did not exceed 800 μl and was allowed to sit at room temperature for 5 minutes to decrease bubble formation. The cuvette was placed in a BioRad Gene Pulser II unit set at 0.296 kV (kilovolts) and 0.950 HC (high capacitance) and electroporated immediately.\n\n\nThe cells were incubated 5 minutes at room temperature before placement in 20 ml total volume of PFCHO media in a CoStar T-75 flask. The flask was placed at 37° C. and 5% CO\n2 \nfor 48 hours when the cells were then counted by hemocytometer utilizing trypan blue exclusion and put into PFCHO selection media without hypothanxine-thymidine supplement and containing 200 mM methotrexate (Cal Biochem).\n\n\nUpon recovery of the methotrexate selection process, the conditioned media containing the secreted TACI-Fc proteins were examined by Western Blot analysis.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nStructural Analysis of TACI-Fc Proteins\n\n\nIn certain cases, TACI-Fc fusion proteins were partially purified before analysis. Conditioned medium from Chinese hamster ovary cultures was sterile-filtered through a 0.22 μm filter and the TACI-Fc protein was captured on a protein A column. The protein A-bound material was eluted and passed over an S-200 size exclusion column for final purification.\n\n\nWestern blot analysis was performed on both conditioned cell medium and purified protein to assess the structural stability of the TACI-Fc proteins. Briefly, protein or supernatant samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and the TACI-Fc proteins were detected using peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2a (Boehringer Mannheim), or peroxidase conjugated goat anti-human IgG Fc specific antisera (Pierce).\n\n\nAmino terminal amino acid sequence analyses were performed on Models 476A and 494 Protein Sequencer Systems from Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems Division (Foster City, Calif.). Data analysis was performed with Applied Biosystems Model 610A Data Analysis System for Protein Sequencing, version 2.1a (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Most supplies and reagents used were from Applied Biosystems, Inc.\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\nFunctional Analysis of TACI-Fc Proteins\n\n\nTwo approaches were used to examine the binding characteristics of four TACI-Fc proteins with ZTNF4. One approach measured the ability of the TACI-Fc constructs to compete with TACI-coated plates for binding of \n125\nI-labeled ZTNF4. In the second approach, increasing concentrations of \n125\nI labeled ZTNF4 were incubated with each of the TACI-Fc constructs, and the radioactivity associated with precipitated ZTNF4-TACI-Fc complexes was determined. The TACI-Fc fusion proteins had TACI moieties that lacked the first 29 amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2. One of the fusion proteins had a TACI moiety with an intact stalk region (TACI (d1-29)-Fc5), whereas three of the TACI-Fc fusion proteins had TACI moieties with various deletions in the stalk region (TACI (d1-29, d107-154)-Fc5; TACI (d1-29, d111-154)-Fc5; TACI (d1-29, d120-154)-Fc5).\n\n\nA. Competitive Binding Assay\n\n\nZTNF4 was radiodinated with Iodobeads (Pierce), following standard methods. Briefly, 50 μg of the ZTNF4 was iodinated with 4 mCi of \n125\nI using a single Iodobead. The reaction was quenched with a 0.25% solution of bovine serum albumin, and the free \n125\nI was removed by gel filtration using a PD-10 column (Pierce). The specific radioactivity of \n125\nI-ZTNF4 preparations was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation before and after the desalting step.\n\n\nAn N-terminal fragment of the TACI receptor, designated as “TACI-N,” was added to 96-well plates (100 μl at 0.1 μg/ml), and incubated overnight at 4° C. The plates were washed, blocked with Superblock (Pierce), and washed again. The TACI-Fc constructs, at various concentrations ranging from 0 to 11.5 ng/ml, were mixed with a fixed concentration of \n125\nI-ZTNF4 (20 ng/ml), and incubated for 2 hours at 37° C. on the plate coated with TACI-N. Controls contained either TACI-N in solution, or lacked TACI-Fc. After incubation, the plates were washed and counted. Each determination was performed in triplicate.\n\n\nThe results showed that all TACI-Fc constructs inhibited \n125\nI-ZTNF4 binding completely at concentrations of about 100 ng/ml or greater. The TACI-Fc proteins, TACI (d1-29)-Fc5, TACI (d1-29, d111-154)-Fc5, and TACI (d1-29, d120-154)-Fc5, were more effective inhibitors than the TACI-Fc construct, TACI (d1-29, d107-154)-Fc5. An Fc fragment alone did not inhibit binding. IC\n50 \nvalues were calculated for each construct in three experiments. The average values for the constructs were: TACI (d1-29)-Fc5: 2.07 nM; TACI (d1-29, d107-154)-Fc5: 4.95 nM; TACI (d1-29, d111-154)-Fc5: 2.31 nM; and TACI (d1-29, d120-154)-Fc5: 2.21 nM.\n\n\nB. Solution Binding Assay\n\n\nAt a concentration of 0.05 nM, each TACI-Fc construct was incubated with 0.4 μM to 1.5 nM \n125\nI-ZTNF4 for 30 minutes at room temperature in a total volume of 0.25 ml/tube. A Pansorbin (Staph A) suspension was added to each tube, and after 15 minutes, the samples were centrifuged, washed twice, and the pellets counted. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of 130 nM unlabeled ZTNF4 to the \n125\nI-ZTNF4/TACI-Fc mix. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting the cpm bound in the presence of unlabeled ZTNF4 from the total cpm bound at each concentration of \n125\nI-ZTNF4. Each determination was performed in triplicate. Binding constants were calculated using GraphPad Prism software (MacIntosh v. 3.0).\n\n\n \nFIG. 4\n illustrates the specific binding of \n125\nI-ZTNF4 to the various TACI-Fc constructs. Binding appeared to approach saturation with each construct, and was significantly higher for constructs TACI (d1-29)-Fc5, TACI (d1-29, d111-154)-Fc5, TACI (d1-29, d120-154)-Fc5, as compared with the binding of TACI (d1-29, d107-154)-Fc5.

A standard curve prepared from soluble, human ZTNF4 at 10 ng/ml, 1 ng/ml, 0.1 ng/ml, 0.01 ng/ml and 0 ng/ml was prepared in ORIGIN buffer (Igen, Gaithersburg, Md.). Serum samples were diluted in ORIGIN buffer. The standards and samples were incubated at room temperature for two hours with biotinylated rabbit anti-human ZTNF4-NF BV antibody diluted to 1 μg/ml in\n\n\nOrigin Assay Buffer (IGEN) and ruthenylated rabbit anti-human ZTNF4-NF BV polyclonal antibody diluted to 1 μg/ml in Origin Assay Buffer (IGEN). Following the incubation the samples were vortexed and 0.4 mg/ml streptavidin Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) were added to each of the standards and samples at 50 μl/tube and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were then vortexed and samples were read on an Origin Analyzer (Igen) according to manufacturer's instructions. The Origin assay is based on electrochemiluminescence and produces a readout in ECL. In one study, an elevated level of ZTNF4 was detected in the serum samples from both NZBWF1/J, and MRL/Mpj-Fas\nlpr \nmice, which have progressed to advanced stages of glomerulonephritis and autoimmune disease.\n\n\nThe ORIGIN ASSAY was also used to measure levels of ZTNF4 in the blood of SLE patients, relative to circulating levels in normal individuals. A standard curve prepared from soluble, human ZTNF4 at 10 ng/ml, 1 ng/ml, 0.1 ng/ml, 0.01 ng/ml and 0 ng/ml was prepared in ORIGIN buffer (Igen). All patient samples were run in triplicate with a 25 μl final volume. The standards and samples were incubated at room temperature for two hours with a capture antibody, biotinylated rabbit anti-human ZTNF4-NF BV polyclonal antibody, diluted to 1 μg/ml in Origin Assay Buffer (IGEN) and a detection antibody, ruthenylated rabbit anti-human ZTNF4-NF BV polyclonal antibody, diluted to 1 μg/ml in Origin Assay Buffer (IGEN). Following the incubation the samples were vortexed, and 0.4 mg/ml streptavidin Dynabeads (Dynal) was added to each of the standards and samples at 50 μl/tube and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were then vortexed, and analyzed using an Origin 1.5 Analyzer (Igen) according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nThis assay included 28 normal control samples and samples from 20 patients diagnosed with SLE. Elevated levels of ZTNF4 were observed in the serum of patients diagnosed with SLE, as compared with normal control serum donors. ZTNF4 levels were calculated as a fold increase of ZTNF4 levels in the patient or control samples as compared to an arbitrary human reference serum sample. The average of the 28 control samples was 1.36 fold over the human reference sample and the average of the 20 SLE patient samples was 4.92. Seven out of the 20 SLE patients had ZTNF4 levels that were two fold over the average of the control samples, whereas there was only one control individual that had a greater than two fold level over the control average.\n\n\nFrom the foregoing, it will be appreciated that, although specific embodiments of the invention have been described herein for purposes of illustration, various modifications may be made without deviating from the spirit and scope of the invention.

The heavy and light chain variable domain sequences of antibodies are under selective pressure and can vary significantly in sequence from one antibody to another (Wu and Kabat, 1970). There are a large number of functional germline variable heavy (˜40; Tomlinson et al., 1992; Tomlinson et al., 1994; Matsuda and Honjo, 1996), variable kappa (˜40; Meindl et al., 1989; Cox et al., 1994; Barbie and Lefranc, 1998) and variable lambda (˜30; Williams et al., 1996; Kawasaki, et al., 1997) genes embedded within the human genome. The ability of the immune system to create many combinations of heavy chain and light chain variable domain germlines is one mechanism for creating antibody diversity (Edelman, 1959; Frañek, 1961). Additional diversity is derived by the insertion of a variable connecting peptide region, the J-connecting peptide (plus D-connecting peptide for heavy chains), between the variable domains and the constant domains (Leder, 1982). Subsequent to germline antibody selection against a specific antigen, B-cells expressing a single antibody with selected variable domain germlines and (D-)J-connecting peptides undergo the process of hypersomatic mutation within the variable heavy and light chain domains to increase antibody affinity towards the antigen (Leder, 1982; Tomlinson et al., 1996). Hypersomatic insertions or deletions within variable domains are also commonly observed, although at a much lower frequency than hypersomatic mutation (de Wildt et al., 1999). Thus, a mature antibody selected against a particular antigen will have highly unique variable domain sequences which are not necessarily optimized for stability.\n\n\nPoor stability can affect the ability of an antibody or antibody domain to fold properly when expressed in various cellular systems, e.g., in bacterial or mammalian expression systems. Misfolding or poor stability can also result in fractional populations of non-functional material (Martsev et al., 1998) and/or antibodies with the tendency to form large soluble aggregates which are potentially dangerous or immunogenic when used therapeutically. Other stability problems include impeded refolding, degradation, impaired avidity, aggregation, or loss of activity following storage.\n\n\nStability problems are not limited to naturally occurring antibodies, but may occur in engineered antigen binding molecules as well, such as recombinant antibody libraries (Hoogenboom, 2005), antibody fragments (Holt et al., 2003; Todorovska et al., 2001; Worn and Plückthun, 2001; Reiter and Pastan, 1996) and engineered or humanized therapeutic antibodies for manufacturing and clinical purposes (Ewert et al., 2004; Carter and Merchant, 1997). In addition, multivalent forms of antibodies, such as bispecific molecules may have stability problems. While bispecific antibodies are desirable because of their therapeutic utility in humans, their production is unpredictable. For example, bispecific antibodies may result in substantial decrease in thermal stability, product yield, or in the formation of low molecular weight aggregates.\n\n\nUnnatural changes to the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains may also arise when humanizing rodent antibodies. Humanization is generally performed by grafting rodent complementarity determining regions (CDRs) onto the most similar human germline variable domain (Hurle and Gross, 1994). The germlines chosen for humanization may not be used with great frequency by the immune system and changes within the human frameworks are often necessary to achieve adequate antigen binding.\n\n\nUnstable proteins suffer from many problems, including one or more of: unsuitability for scale-up production in bioreactors (e.g., because of low yield, significant levels of unwanted byproducts such as unassembled product, and/or aggregated material), difficulties in protein purification, and unsuitability for pharmaceutical preparation and use (e.g., owing to significant levels of breakdown product, poor product quality, and/or unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties). Instability within the variable domains of antibodies, Fabs, Fvs, or single-chain Fvs (scFvs) may result in many of these problems. scFv constructs in particular have demonstrated problems with stability, solubility, expression, aggregation, breakdown products, and overall manufacturability in both bacterial and in mammalian expression systems (see Worn and Pluckthun, 2001). Additionally, incorporation of scFv molecules into otherwise stable recombinant antibody products often imparts these generally undesirable traits to the new recombinant design.\n\n\nAccordingly, there is a need for improved methods of predicting the stability of proteins, such as antibodies, and for improved, stable antigen binding molecules that are suitable for scalable production. There is also a need for improved methods that allow for scalable production of a population of stable antigen binding molecules that are suitable for pharmaceutical applications.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention is based, at least in part, on the development of improved polypeptide compositions, e.g. improved binding molecules, comprising or consisting of scFv molecules with improved stability and methods for making the same.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention pertains to a population of stabilized scFv molecules, wherein the stabilized scFv molecules comprise\n\n\ni) a scFv linker interposed between a V\nH \ndomain and a V\nL \ndomain, wherein the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains are linked by a disulfide bond between an amino acid in the V\nH \ndomain and an amino acid in the V\nL \ndomain, and wherein the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of the scFv molecules have Tm values of greater than 55° C.;

In addition, the instant invention provides methods for designing stable proteins, such as antibody molecules.\n\n\nThe stabilized scFv molecules of the instant invention are especially useful in producing stable multispecific, e.g., bispecific molecules. The stabilized binding molecules of the invention, e.g., multispecific binding molecules can be stably expressed in culture, are suitable for large scale production, and are stable in vivo.\n\n\nThe invention is also based, at least in part, on the development of stabilized binding molecules that consist of or comprise a stabilized scFv molecule and methods for making such stabilized binding molecules. In addition, the instant invention provides methods for designing stable proteins and for predicting the stability of proteins, such as antibody molecules.\n\n\nBefore further description of the invention, for convenience, certain terms are described below:\n\n\nI. Definitions\n\n\nAs used herein the term “scFv molecule” includes binding molecules which consist of one light chain variable domain (VL) or portion thereof, and one heavy chain variable domain (VH) or portion thereof, wherein each variable domain (or portion thereof) is derived from the same or different antibodies. scFv molecules preferably comprise an scFv linker interposed between the VH domain and the VL domain. scFv molecules are known in the art and are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,892,019, Ho et al. 1989. Gene 77:51; Bird et al. 1988 \nScience \n242:423; Pantoliano et al. 1991\n. Biochemistry \n30:10117; Milenic et al. 1991. Cancer Research 51:6363; Takkinen et al. 1991\n. Protein Engineering \n4:837.\n\n\nA “scFv linker” as used herein refers to a moiety interposed between the VL and VH domains of the scFv. scFv linkers preferably maintain the scFv molecule in a antigen binding conformation. In one embodiment, an scFv linker comprises or consists of an scFv linker peptide. In certain embodiments, an scFv linker peptide comprises or consists of a gly-ser connecting peptide. In other embodiments, an scFv linker comprises a disulfide bond.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “gly-ser connecting peptide” refers to a peptide that consists of glycine and serine residues. An exemplary gly/ser connecting peptide comprises the amino acid sequence (Gly\n4 \nSer)\nn \n(SEQ ID NO: 156). In one embodiment, n=1. In one embodiment, n=2. In another embodiment, n=3. In a preferred embodiment, n=4, i.e., (Gly\n4 \nSer)\n4\n. In another embodiment, n=5. In yet another embodiment, n=6.\n\n\nAnother exemplary gly/ser connecting peptide comprises the amino acid sequence Ser(Gly\n4\nSer)\nn \n(SEQ ID NO: 157). In one embodiment, n=1. In one embodiment, n=2. In a preferred embodiment, n=3. In another embodiment, n=4. In another embodiment, n=5. In yet another embodiment, n=6.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “disulfide bond” refers to the covalent bond formed between two sulfur atoms. The amino acid cysteine comprises a thiol group that can form a disulfide bond or bridge with a second thiol group.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “conventional scFv molecule” refers to an scFv molecule which is not a stabilized scFv molecule. For example, a typical conventional scFv molecule lacks stabilizing mutations and comprises a VH and a VL domain linked by a (G\n4\nS)3 linker.\n\n\nA “stabilized scFv molecule” of the invention is an scFv molecule comprising at least one change or alteration as compared to a conventional scFv molecule which results in stabilization of the scFv molecule. As used herein, the term “stabilizing mutation” includes a mutation which confers enhanced protein stability (e.g. thermal stability) to the scFv molecule and/or to a larger protein comprising said scFv molecule. In one embodiment, the stabilizing mutation comprises the substitution of a destabilizing amino acid with a replacement amino acid that confers enhanced protein stability (herein a “stabilizing amino acid”). In one embodiment, the stabilizing mutation is one in which the length of an scFv linker has been optimized. In one embodiment, a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention comprises one or more amino acid substitutions. For example, in one embodiment, a stabilizing mutation comprises a substitution of at least one amino acid residue which substitution results in an increase in stability of the VH and VL interface of an scFv molecule. In one embodiment, the amino acid is within the interface. In another embodiment, the amino acid is one which scaffolds the interaction between VH and VL. In another embodiment, a stabilizing mutation comprises substituting at least one amino acid in the VH domain or VL domain that covaries with two or more amino acids at the interface between the VH and VL domains. In another embodiment, the stabilizing mutation is one in which at least one cysteine residue is introduced (i.e., is engineered into one or more of the VH or VL domain) such that the VH and VL domains are linked by at least one disulfide bond between an amino acid in the VH and an amino acid in the VL domain. In certain preferred embodiments, a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention is one in which both the length of the scFv linker is optimized and at least one amino acid residue is substituted and/or the VH and VL domains are linked by a disulfide bond between an amino acid in the VH and an amino acid in the VL domain. In one embodiment, more than one of the stabilizing mutations described herein may be made in an scFv molecule.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, one or more stabilizing mutations made to an scFv molecule simultaneously improves the thermal stability of both the VH and VL domains of the scFv molecule as compared to a conventional scFv molecule.\n\n\nPreferably, a population of one or more of the stabilized scFv molecules of the invention is expressed as a population of monomeric, soluble proteins. In one embodiment, no more than 10% is present in aggregated form. In one embodiment, the stabilized scFv molecules of the population may comprise the same stabilizing mutation or a combination of stabilizing mutations. In other embodiments, the individual stabilized scFv molecules of the population comprise different stabilizing mutations.\n\n\nThe subject stabilized scFv molecules may be used alone to bind to a target molecule or may be linked to another polypeptide to form stabilized binding molecules which comprise a stabilized scFv molecule. For example, a binding molecule of the invention may comprise an scFv molecule linked to a second scFv molecule or a non-scFv molecule, e.g., that imparts target binding specificity, such as an antibody.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “protein stability” refers to an art-recognized measure of the maintenance of one or more physical properties of a protein in response to an environmental condition (e.g. an elevated or lowered temperature). In one embodiment, the physical property is the maintenance of the covalent structure of the protein (e.g. the absence of proteolytic cleavage, unwanted oxidation or deamidation). In another embodiment, the physical property is the presence of the protein in a properly folded state (e.g. the absence of soluble or insoluble aggregates or precipitates). In one embodiment, stability of a protein is measured by assaying a biophysical property of the protein, for example thermal stability, pH unfolding profile, stable removal of glycosylation, solubility, biochemical function (e.g., ability to bind to a protein (e.g., a ligand, a receptor, an antigen, etc.) or chemical moiety, etc.), and/or combinations thereof. In another embodiment, biochemical function is demonstrated by the binding affinity of an interaction. In one embodiment, a measure of protein stability is thermal stability, i.e., resistance to thermal challenge. Stability can be measured using methods known in the art and/or described herein.\n\n\nThe VL and VH domains of an scFv molecule are derived from one or more antibody molecules. It will also be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the variable regions of the scFv molecules of the invention may be modified such that they vary in amino acid sequence from the antibody molecule from which they were derived. For example, in one embodiment, nucleotide or amino acid substitutions leading to conservative substitutions or changes at amino acid residues may be made (e.g., in CDR and/or framework residues). Alternatively or in addition, mutations may be made to CDR amino acid residues to optimize antigen binding using art recognized techniques. The binding molecules of the invention maintain the ability to bind to antigen.\n\n\nAs used herein the term “derived from” a designated protein refers to the origin of the polypeptide. In one embodiment, the polypeptide or amino acid sequence which is derived from a particular starting polypeptide is a variable region sequence (e.g. a VH or VL) or sequence related thereto (e.g. a CDR or framework region). In one embodiment, the amino acid sequence which is derived from a particular starting polypeptide is not contiguous. For example, in one embodiment, one, two, three, four, five, or six CDRs are derived from a starting antibody. In one embodiment, the polypeptide or amino acid sequence that is derived from a particular starting polypeptide or amino acid sequence has an amino acid sequence that is essentially identical to that of the starting sequence or a portion thereof, wherein the portion consists of at least 3-5 amino acids, 5-10 amino acids, at least 10-20 amino acids, at least 20-30 amino acids, or at least 30-50 amino acids, or which is otherwise identifiable to one of ordinary skill in the art as having its origin in the starting sequence.\n\n\nAn isolated nucleic acid molecule encoding a stabilized scFv molecule or a portion thereof can be created by introducing one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions into the nucleotide sequence of a conventional scFv molecule or an immunoglobulin from which it is derived such that one or more amino acid substitutions, additions or deletions are introduced into the encoded protein. Mutations may be introduced by standard techniques, such as site-directed mutagenesis and PCR-mediated mutagenesis. In one embodiment, conservative amino acid substitutions are made at one or more non-essential amino acid residues. A “conservative amino acid substitution” is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art, including basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Thus, an amino acid residue in an immunoglobulin polypeptide may be replaced with another amino acid residue from the same side chain family. In another embodiment, a string of amino acids can be replaced with a structurally similar string that differs in order and/or composition of side chain family members. In another embodiment, a mutation is introduced in order to introduce at least one cysteine molecule into the VH and into the VL domain and, thereby, introduce a disulfide bond into the scFv molecule. In another embodiment, an amino acid of a conventional scFv molecule may be substituted with an amino acid having similar physical (e.g., spatial) or functional properties. Preferably, amino acids substituted into conventional scFv molecules are compatible with the integrity of the V\nL\n/V\nH \ninterface, CDR conformations, and V\nH \nand/or V\nL \nfolding.\n\n\nAlternatively, in another embodiment, mutations may be introduced randomly along all or part of the immunoglobulin coding sequence.\n\n\nThe stabilized scFv molecules of the invention or polypeptides comprising the stabilized scFv molecules are binding molecules, i.e., they bind to a target molecule of interest, e.g., an antigen. When a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention is fused to a second molecule, the second molecule may also impart a binding specificity to the fusion protein.\n\n\nThe binding molecules of the invention consist of scFv molecules (e.g., a VH and a VL domain joined by an scFv linker) or comprise a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention are monovalent, i.e., comprise one target binding site (e.g., as in the case of an scFv molecule). In one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention are multivalent, i.e., comprise more than one target binding site. In another embodiment, the binding molecules comprise at least two binding sites. In one embodiment, the binding molecules comprise two binding sites. In one embodiment, the binding molecules comprise three binding sites. In another embodiment, the binding molecules comprise four binding sites. In another embodiment, the binding molecules comprise greater than four binding sites.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention are monomers. In another embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention are multimers. For example, in one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention are dimers. In one embodiment, the dimers of the invention are homodimers, comprising two identical monomeric subunits. In another embodiment, the dimers of the invention are heterodimers, comprising two non-identical monomeric subunits. The subunits of the dimer may comprise one or more polypeptide chains. For example, in one embodiment, the dimers comprise at least two polypeptide chains. In one embodiment, the dimers comprise two polypeptide chains. In another embodiment, the dimers comprise four polypeptide chains (e.g., as in the case of antibody molecules).\n\n\nAs used herein the term “valency” refers to the number of potential target binding sites in a polypeptide. Each target binding site specifically binds one target molecule or specific site on a target molecule. When a polypeptide comprises more than one target binding site, each target binding site may specifically bind the same or different molecules (e.g., may bind to different molecules, e.g., different antigens, or different epitopes on the same molecule).\n\n\nThe term “specificity” refers to the ability to specifically bind (e.g., immunoreact with) a given target. A polypeptide may be monospecific and contain one or more binding sites which specifically bind a target or a polypeptide may be multispecific (e.g., bispecific or trispecific) and contain two or more binding sites which specifically bind the same or different targets. Specific binding may be imparted by a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention and/or a non-scFv moiety to which a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention is linked.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is multispecific. For example, in one embodiment, a multispecific binding molecule of the invention is a bispecific molecule (e.g., antibody, minibody, domain deleted antibody, or fusion protein, single domain antibodies (e.g., camelid, shark, human) comprising at least one stabilized scFv molecule) having binding specificity for at least two targets, e.g., more than one target molecule or more than one epitope on the same target molecule. In one embodiment, a multispecific molecule has at least one binding site specific for a molecule targeted for reduction or elimination and a target molecule on a cell. In another embodiment, a multispecific molecule has at least one target binding site specific for a molecule targeted for reduction or elimination and at least one binding site specific for a drug. In yet another embodiment, a multispecific molecule has at least one binding site specific for a molecule targeted for reduction or elimination and at least one binding site specific for a prodrug.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a multispecific molecule comprises one specificity for a soluble molecule and one specificity for a cell surface molecule. In another embodiment, a multispecific molecule has two binding specificities for two targets present on one or more soluble molecules. In another embodiment, a multispecific molecule has two binding specificities for two targets present on one or more cell surface molecules (which may be present on one or more cells).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the binding molecules have at least one target binding site specific for a molecule which mediates a biological effect (e.g., which modulates cellular activation (e.g., by binding to a cell surface receptor and resulting in transmission or inhibition of an activating or inhibitory signal), which results in death of the cell (e.g., by a cell signal induced pathway, by complement fixation or exposure to a payload present on the binding molecule), or which modulates a disease or disorder in a subject (e.g., by mediating or promoting cell killing, by promoting lysis of a fibrin clot or promoting clot formation, or by modulating the amount of a substance which is bioavailable (e.g., by enhancing or reducing the amount of a ligand such as TNFα in the subject)).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention bind at least one target that transduces a signal to a cell, e.g., by binding to a cell surface receptor, such as a TNF family receptor. By “transduces a signal” it is meant that by binding to the cell, the binding molecule converts the extracellular influence on the cell surface receptor into a cellular response, e.g., by modulating a signal transduction pathway.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the binding molecules bind at least one target binding site specific for a molecule targeted for reduction or elimination, e.g., a cell surface antigen or a soluble antigen. In one embodiment, the binding of the binding molecule to the target results in reduction or elimination of the target, e.g., from a tissue or from the circulation. In another embodiment, the binding molecules have at least one binding site specific for a molecule that can be used to detect the presence of a target molecule (e.g., to detect a contaminant or diagnose a condition or disorder). In yet another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one binding site that targets the binding molecule to a specific site in a subject (e.g., to a tumor cell or blood clot).\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, a multispecific molecule is a tetravalent antibody that has four binding sites. A tetravalent molecule may be bispecific and bivalent for each specificity. Further description of exemplary bispecific molecules is provided below.\n\n\nPreferred binding molecules of the invention comprise framework and constant region amino acid sequences derived from a human amino acid sequence. However, binding polypeptides may comprise framework and/or constant region sequences derived from another mammalian species. For example, binding molecules comprising murine sequences may be appropriate for certain applications. In one embodiment, a primate framework region (e.g., non-human primate), heavy chain portion, and/or hinge portion may be included in the subject binding molecules. In one embodiment, one or more murine amino acids may be present in the framework region of a binding polypeptide, e.g., a human or non-human primate framework amino acid sequence may comprise one or more amino acid back mutations in which the corresponding murine amino acid residue is present and/or may comprise one or mutations to a different amino acid residue not found in the starting murine antibody. Preferred binding molecules of the invention are less immunogenic than murine antibodies.\n\n\nA “fusion” or chimeric protein comprises a first amino acid sequence linked to a second amino acid sequence with which it is not naturally linked in nature. The amino acid sequences may normally exist in separate proteins that are brought together in the fusion polypeptide or they may normally exist in the same protein but are placed in a new arrangement in the fusion polypeptide. A fusion protein may be created, for example, by chemical synthesis, or by creating and translating a polynucleotide in which the peptide regions are encoded in the desired relationship.\n\n\nThe term “heterologous” as applied to a polynucleotide or a polypeptide, means that the polynucleotide or polypeptide is derived from a genotypically distinct entity from that of the entity to which it is being compared. For instance, a heterologous polynucleotide or antigen may be derived from a different species, different cell type of an individual, or the same or different type of cell of distinct individuals.\n\n\nThe term “ligand binding domain” or “ligand binding portion” as used herein refers to any native receptor (e.g., cell surface receptor) or any region or derivative thereof retaining at least a qualitative ligand binding ability, and preferably the biological activity of a corresponding native receptor.\n\n\nThe term “receptor binding domain” or “receptor binding portion” as used herein refers to any native ligand or any region or derivative thereof retaining at least a qualitative receptor binding ability, and preferably the biological activity of a corresponding native ligand.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention are stabilized “antibody” or “immunoglobulin” molecules, e.g., naturally occurring antibody or immunoglobulin molecules (or an antigen binding fragment thereof) or genetically engineered antibody molecules that bind antigen in a manner similar to antibody molecules and that comprise an scFv molecule of the invention. As used herein, the term “immunoglobulin” includes a polypeptide having a combination of two heavy and two light chains whether or not it possesses any relevant specific immunoreactivity. “Antibodies” refers to such assemblies which have significant known specific immunoreactive activity to an antigen of interest (e.g. a tumor associated antigen). Antibodies and immunoglobulins comprise light and heavy chains, with or without an interchain covalent linkage between them. Basic immunoglobulin structures in vertebrate systems are relatively well understood.\n\n\nAs will be discussed in more detail below, the generic term “immunoglobulin” comprises five distinct classes of that can be distinguished biochemically. All five classes of antibodies are within the scope of the present invention, the following discussion will generally be directed to the IgG class of immunoglobulin molecules. With regard to IgG, immunoglobulins comprise two identical light polypeptide chains of molecular weight approximately 23,000 Daltons, and two identical heavy chains of molecular weight 53,000-70,000. The four chains are joined by disulfide bonds in a “Y” configuration wherein the light chains bracket the heavy chains starting at the mouth of the “Y” and continuing through the variable region.\n\n\nBoth the light and heavy chains are divided into regions of structural and functional homology. The terms “constant” and “variable” are used functionally. In this regard, it will be appreciated that the variable domains of both the light (VL) and heavy (VH) chain portions determine antigen recognition and specificity. Conversely, the constant domains of the light chain (CL) and the heavy chain (CH1, CH2 or CH3) confer important biological properties such as secretion, transplacental mobility, Fc receptor binding, complement binding, and the like. By convention the numbering of the constant region domains increases as they become more distal from the antigen binding site or amino-terminus of the antibody. The N-terminus is a variable region and at the C-terminus is a constant region; the CH3 and CL domains actually comprise the carboxy-terminus of the heavy and light chain, respectively.\n\n\nStabilizing mutations to scFv molecules may be made to amino acids in the CDR and/or in the framework regions of an scFv variable heavy and/or variable light chaing. As used herein the term “variable region CDR amino acid residues” includes amino acids in a CDR or complementarity determining region as identified using sequence or structure based methods. As used herein, the term “CDR” or “complementarity determining region” means the noncontiguous antigen combining sites found within the variable region of both heavy and light chain polypeptides. These particular regions have been described by Kabat et al., J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6609-6616 (1977) and Kabat et al., Sequences of protein of immunological interest. (1991), and by Chothia et al., J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987) and by MacCallum et al., J. Mol. Biol. 262:732-745 (1996) where the definitions include overlapping or subsets of amino acid residues when compared against each other. The amino acid residues which encompass the CDRs as defined by each of the above cited references are set forth for comparison. Preferably, the term “CDR” is a CDR as defined by Kabat based on sequence comparisons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDR Definitions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKabat\n1\n \n\n\nChothia\n2\n \n\n\nMacCallum\n3\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nH \nCDR1\n\n\n31-35\n\n\n26-32\n\n\n30-35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nH \nCDR2\n\n\n50-65\n\n\n53-55\n\n\n47-58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nH \nCDR3\n\n\n 95-102\n\n\n 96-101\n\n\n 93-101\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nL \nCDR1\n\n\n24-34\n\n\n26-32\n\n\n30-36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nL \nCDR2\n\n\n50-56\n\n\n50-52\n\n\n46-55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nL \nCDR3\n\n\n89-97\n\n\n91-96\n\n\n89-96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n1\nResidue numbering follows the nomenclature of Kabat et al., supra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n2\nResidue numbering follows the nomenclature of Chothia et al., supra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n3\nResidue numbering follows the nomenclature of MacCallum et al., supra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs used herein the term “variable region framework (FR) amino acid residues” refers to those amino acids in the framework region of an Ig chain. The term “framework region” or “FR region” as used herein, includes the amino acid residues that are part of the variable region, but are not part of the CDRs (e.g., using the Kabat definition of CDRs). Therefore, a variable region framework is between about 100-120 amino acids in length but includes only those amino acids outside of the CDRs. For the specific example of a heavy chain variable region and for the CDRs as defined by Kabat et al., \nframework region\n 1 corresponds to the domain of the variable region encompassing amino acids 1-30; \nframework region\n 2 corresponds to the domain of the variable region encompassing amino acids 36-49; \nframework region\n 3 corresponds to the domain of the variable region encompassing amino acids 66-94, and \nframework region\n 4 corresponds to the domain of the variable region from \namino acids\n 103 to the end of the variable region. The framework regions for the light chain are similarly separated by each of the light chain variable region CDRs. Similarly, using the definition of CDRs by Chothia et al. or McCallum et al. the framework region boundaries are separated by the respective CDR termini as described above. In preferred embodiments, the CDRs are as defined by Kabat.\n\n\nIn naturally occurring antibodies, the six CDRs present on each monomeric antibody are short, non-contiguous sequences of amino acids that are specifically positioned to form the antigen binding site as the antibody assumes its three dimensional configuration in an aqueous environment. The remainder of the heavy and light variable domains show less inter-molecular variability in amino acid sequence and are termed the framework regions. The framework regions largely adopt a β-sheet conformation and the CDRs form loops which connect, and in some cases form part of, the β-sheet structure. Thus, these framework regions act to form a scaffold that provides for positioning the six CDRs in correct orientation by inter-chain, non-covalent interactions. The antigen binding site formed by the positioned CDRs defines a surface complementary to the epitope on the immunoreactive antigen. This complementary surface promotes the non-covalent binding of the antibody to the immunoreactive antigen epitope. The position of CDRs can be readily identified by one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nAs previously indicated, the subunit structures and three dimensional configuration of the constant regions of the various immunoglobulin classes are well known. As used herein, the term “VH domain” includes the amino terminal variable domain of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. As used herein, the term “VL domain” includes the amino terminal variable domain of an immunoglobulin light chain.\n\n\nThe term “fragment” refers to a part or portion of a polypeptide (e.g., an antibody or an antibody chain) comprising fewer amino acid residues than an intact or complete polypeptide. The term “antigen-binding fragment” refers to a polypeptide fragment of an immunoglobulin or antibody that binds antigen or competes with intact antibody (i.e., with the intact antibody from which they were derived) for antigen binding (i.e., specific binding). As used herein, the term “fragment” of an antibody molecule includes antigen-binding fragments of antibodies, for example, an antibody light chain (VL), an antibody heavy chain (VH), a single chain antibody (scFv), a F(ab′)2 fragment, a Fab fragment, an Fd fragment, an Fv fragment, and a single domain antibody fragment (DAb). Fragments can be obtained, e.g., via chemical or enzymatic treatment of an intact or complete antibody or antibody chain or by recombinant means.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “binding site” comprises a region of a polypeptide which is responsible for selectively binding to a target molecule of interest (e.g. an antigen, ligand, receptor, substrate or inhibitor). Binding domains comprise at least one target binding site. Exemplary binding domains include an antibody variable domain, a receptor binding domain of a ligand, a ligand binding domain of a receptor or an enzymatic domain.\n\n\nBinding molecules of the invention can be made using techniques that are known in the art. In one embodiment, the polypeptides of the invention are “recombinantly produced,” i.e., are produced using recombinant DNA technology. Exemplary techniques for making such molecules are discussed in more detail below.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is a naturally occurring antibody to which a stabilized scFv molecule has been fused. In one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is a modified antibody to which a stabilized scFv molecule has been fused. As used herein, the term “modified antibody” includes synthetic forms of antibodies which are altered such that they are not naturally occurring. In another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is a fusion protein comprising at least one scFv molecule.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, a polypeptide of the invention will not elicit a deleterious immune response in a human.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises a constant region, e.g., a heavy chain constant region. In one embodiment, such a constant region is modified compared to a wild-type constant region. That is, the polypeptides of the invention disclosed herein may comprise alterations or modifications to one or more of the three heavy chain constant domains (CH1, CH2 or CH3) and/or to the light chain constant region domain (CL). Exemplary modifications include additions, deletions or substitutions of one or more amino acids in one or more domains. Such changes may be included to optimize effector function, half-life, etc.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “malignancy” refers to a non-benign tumor or a cancer. As used herein, the term “cancer” includes a malignancy characterized by deregulated or uncontrolled cell growth. Exemplary cancers include: carcinomas, sarcomas, leukemias, and lymphomas. The term “cancer” includes primary malignant tumors (e.g., those whose cells have not migrated to sites in the subject's body other than the site of the original tumor) and secondary malignant tumors (e.g., those arising from metastasis, the migration of tumor cells to secondary sites that are different from the site of the original tumor).\n\n\nAs used herein the term “engineered” includes manipulation of nucleic acid or polypeptide molecules by synthetic means (e.g. by recombinant techniques, in vitro peptide synthesis, by enzymatic or chemical coupling of peptides or some combination of these techniques). Preferably, the binding molecules of the invention are made using such methods.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “linked,” “fused” or “fusion” are used interchangeably. These terms refer to the joining together of two more elements or components, by whatever means including chemical conjugation or recombinant means. Preferably the polypeptides which are fused are genetically fused, i.e., are fused using recombinant DNA technology. An “in-frame fusion” refers to the joining of two or more open reading frames (ORFs) to form a continuous longer ORF, in a manner that maintains the correct reading frame of the original ORFs. Thus, the resulting fusion protein is a single protein containing two or more segments that correspond to polypeptides encoded by the original ORFs (which segments are not normally so joined in nature.) Although the reading frame is thus made continuous throughout the fused segments, the segments may be physically or spatially separated by, for example, in-frame scFv linker sequence.\n\n\nIn the context of polypeptides, a “linear sequence” or a “sequence” is an order of amino acids in a polypeptide in an amino to carboxyl terminal direction in which residues that neighbor each other in the sequence are contiguous in the primary structure of the polypeptide.\n\n\nAs used herein, the phrase “subject that would benefit from administration of a binding molecule” includes subjects, such as mammalian subjects, that would benefit from administration of a binding molecule used, e.g., for detection of an antigen recognized by a binding molecule (e.g., for a diagnostic procedure) and/or from treatment with a binding molecule to reduce or eliminate the target recognized by the binding molecule. For example, in one embodiment, the subject may benefit from reduction or elimination of a soluble or particulate molecule from the circulation or serum (e.g., a toxin or pathogen) or from reduction or elimination of a population of cells expressing the target (e.g., tumor cells). As described in more detail herein, the binding molecule can be used in unconjugated form or can be conjugated, e.g., to a detectable moiety, a drug, prodrug, or an isotope.\n\n\nThe term “TNF receptor” or “TNF receptor family member” refers to any receptor belonging to the Tumor Necrosis Factor (“TNF”) superfamily of receptors. Members of the TNF Receptor Superfamily (“TNFRSF”) are characterized by an extracellular region with two or more cysteine-rich domains (˜40 amino acids each) arranged as cysteine knots (see Dempsey et al., \nCytokine Growth Factor Rev\n. (2003). 14(3-4):193-209). Upon binding their cognate TNF ligands, TNF receptors transduce signals by interacting directly or indirectly with cytoplasmic adapter proteins known as TRAFs (TNF receptor associate factors). TRAFs can induce the activation of several kinase cascades that ultimately lead to the activation of signal transduction pathways such as NF-KappaB, JNK, ERK, p38 and PI3K, which in turn regulate cellular processes ranging from immune function and tissue differentiation to apoptosis.\n\n\nThe nucleotide and amino acid sequences of several TNF receptors family members are known in the art and include at least 29 human genes: TNFRSF1A (TNFR1, also known as DR1, CD120a, TNF-R-I p55, TNF-R, TNFR1, TNFAR, TNF-R55, p55TNFR, p55R, or TNFR60, GenBank GI No. 4507575; see also U.S. Pat.

Methods for Predicting/Determining Protein Stability\n\n\nIn certain aspects, the invention provides methods for predicting, a priori, potentional biophysical problems with proteins selected for large-scale expression, e.g. therapeutic proteins or industrial enzymes. In certain exemplary aspects, the methods of the invention allow one skilled in the art to avoid expressing protein sequences that are predicted to have inherently poor stability when recombinantly expressed, for example, in mammalian cells. In alternative aspects, the methods of the invention may be employed to identify a variant of a protein sequence that is predicted to have improved biophysical properties, including, but not limited to improved stability, improved stability to changes in pH, and enhanced biochemical function.\n\n\nIn certain aspects, the invention provides computational methods for predicting a biophysical property of (e.g., thermal stability) a candidate proteins, or a sequence variant or homolog thereof, based on the polypeptide sequence (e.g. amino acid sequence) of the candidate protein. In other aspects, the methods of the invention employ structural modeling to predict the stability of the candidate protein or to identify homologs or variants of the candidate protein with known exemplary stability that can be used to improve the stability of a candidate protein, e.g., an scFv molecule.\n\n\na. Covariation Analysis\n\n\nIn certain exemplary aspects, the invention provides an improved computational method termed “covariation analysis” for predicting a biophysical property (e.g. protein stability). As used herein, “covariation analysis” refers to a computational method for identifying two or more amino acid residue positions within a candidate polypeptide sequence that normally occur together, or covary, in homologs of the candidate sequence (herein “covarying residue positions” or “covariant residue positions”). Covariance between two or more amino acid positions is observed when the type of amino acid found at a first amino acid position is dependent on the type of amino acid found at another amino acid position. That is, when one particular amino acid is found at a first position within a sequence, a second particular amino acid is usually found at a second position within the sequence.\n\n\nSince covariant residues are likely to have coevolved, an observation of covariation indicates that the compatibility of amino acid residues residing at normally covarying positions is likely to be important for functional or structural reasons. Accordingly, the covariation method of the invention can be used to identify one or more covarying residues or groups of residues (e.g. covarying residue pairs) within a polypeptide sequence (e.g. a candidate polypeptide sequence). As used herein, a “covarying residue” (also termed a “linked residue”) is an amino acid which is statistically prevalent at a covarying residue position within a polypeptide sequence.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the covariation methods of the invention can be used to identify important functional residues in a candidate sequence. Moreover, since the number of covarying residues within a candidate polypeptide is predictive of its stability, the covariation method of the invention can be used to predict the stability candidate protein.\n\n\nIn other certain embodiments, the covariation methods of the invention can be employed to guide successful protein designs. In one exemplary embodiment, the covariation method of the invention can be used to identify covarying amino acids within a candidate sequence. If present, the covarying residues are preferably retained during subsequent engineering of the protein sequence. In another exemplary embodiment, the covariation methods of the invention can be used to identify the amino acid positions of non-covarying residues within a candidate polypeptide sequence wherein corresponding amino acids in other proteins (e.g., proteins corresponding to the sequences of a reference set) are normally covarying amino acids. Once identified, non-covarying residues can be substituted (e.g. using recombinant DNA methodology) with corresponding covarying residues to enhance function or improve the biophysical properties (e.g., stability) of the candidate polypeptide sequence.\n\n\nCovariant residue positions may be identified by a statistical analysis (e.g., a correlation analysis) of residue positions within a database of related polypeptide sequences (e.g., an aligned reference set or multiple sequence alignment). In preferred embodiments, the covariation analysis involves a statistical comparison of candidate polypeptide sequences against a curated database of diverse polypeptide sequences having the same structural fold (e.g. an Ig fold).\n\n\nIn the novel covariation analysis described herein, the following basic steps are taken to predict the stability of a candidate polypeptide:\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Providing a set of homologous sequences (herein, a “reference set”) corresponding to a sequence of a candidate polypeptide or a domain or portion thereof (herein a “test domain sequence”).\n \n2. Aligning the sequences of the reference set to generate an aligned set of homologous sequence (herein, an “aligned set).\n \n3. Determining covariation between two or more residue positions (e.g. at least one pair of amino acids) within the reference set to generate covariation data or a set of covariation data (“covariation dataset”).\n \n4. Using the covariation data to predict the stability of the candidate polypeptide.\n \n \n \n\n\nStep 1: Providing a Reference Set\n\n\nThe covariation methods of the invention employ a set of sequences (a “reference set”) which are homologous to (i.e., related to) a sequence of interest or “test sequence”. The reference set may comprise a set of homologous sequences having moderate to high degrees of similarity with the test sequence. In certain embodiments, the homologous sequences of the reference set have a moderate to high degree of amino acid sequence similarity. In more preferred embodiments, the homologous sequences of the reference set have a moderate to high degree of structural similarity. In still more preferred embodiments, the homologous sequences of the reference set have a high degree of structural similarity (e.g. they share at least one protein domain or fold). The set of homologous sequences need not be large, as long as a reasonably unbiased selection is obtained.\n\n\nIn exemplary embodiments, the covariation method of the invention employs a curated reference set. As used herein, the term “curated reference set” refers to a reference set in which component sequences have been deleted or additional sequences added according to certain selection criteria. Accordingly, whereas a non-curated reference is generated by unbiased selection of component sequences, a curated database is generated by biased selection. For example, the reference set of homologous sequences may be culled to eliminate certain sequences, e.g. redundant sequence. Alternatively, a curated database may be expanded, e.g. to include a suitable number of non-redundant or non-identical sequences.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the curated database comprises at least one hundred sequences (e.g. 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 750, or more sequences). In one embodiment, the curated database comprises at least one thousand sequences (e.g. 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, or more sequences). In another embodiment, the curated database comprises at least ten thousand sequences (e.g., 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, 100,000, 250,000, 500,000, 750,000 or more sequence. In one embodiment the curated database comprises at least 1 million individual sequences (e.g., 1 million, 2 million, 5 million, 10 million, or more sequences).\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, the covariation method of the invention employs a curated reference set having at least 50% diversity (e.g. at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95% diversity, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or more diversity) in order to minimize artificial or non-informative covariations. As used herein, the term “% diversity” refers to the percentage of sequences in the reference set that are non-redundant or non-identical. As used herein, the term “non-redundant” refers to a sequence which has less than 100% sequence identity with every other sequence in the reference set, i.e., a sequence which differs at least in one amino acid position from every other sequence in the reference set. In certain embodiments, a sequence of the reference set has less than 99%, less than 95%, less than 90%, or less than 85% sequence identity with every other sequence in the reference set. In preferred embodiments, a sequence of the reference set has less than 80% sequence identity with every other sequence in the reference set (e.g. less than 75%, less than 70%, less than 65%, less than 60%, or less than 50% sequence identity). In particularly preferred embodiments, every sequence of the reference set has less than than 80% sequence identity with every other sequence in the reference set. In exemplary embodiments, the sequences of the reference set are curated for the preferred diversity using a filtering tool which culls sequences containing more common sequence types (e.g., a Henikoff sorting tool). When two sequences are equal in length, sorting by Henikoff weight ensures that sequences with rare residue types are retained while sequences with more common residue types are discarded (Henikoff et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n243: 574-578 (1994)).\n\n\nIn other preferred embodiments, the reference set comprises sequences encoded by genes which are not evolutionarily close to genes encoding other sequences in the database. For example, to increase diversity, the reference set may comprise one or more ortholog sequences, that is a sequence which is from a different species (e.g., different mammalian species)) but which has the same or similar biochemical function. In one exemplary embodiment, the reference set may comprise one human sequence and at least one non-human sequence (e.g., a non-human mammalian sequence). In another exemplary embodiment, the reference set may comprise at least one sequence for a mammalian species (e.g. a human, chimpanzee, dog, cow, pig, cat, rat, or mouse) and at least one non-mammalian sequence (e.g. a non-mammalian vertebrate sequence (e.g., a teleost or avian sequence), an invertebrate sequence (e.g., an insect (e.g., \nDrosophila\n) or nematode (e.g., \nC. elegans\n) sequence), or a fungal, plant, bacterial, or virus sequence). In other embodiments, the reference set may comprise one or more paralog sequences, that is sequences from the same species as a first sequence, but which has the same or similar biochemical function.\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the sequences of the reference set are above a certain threshold length. Preferably, the sequences of the reference set are at least 20 residues in length (e.g. 25, 30, or 40 residues in length). More preferably, the sequences of the reference set are at least 50 residues in length (e.g., 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, or 95 residues in length). Still more preferred are sequences of at least 100 residues in length (e.g., 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, or more residues in length). In exemplary embodiments, the sequences of the reference set are curated for the preferred length by filtering using a filtering tool (e.g., a non-gap residue count). Ranking by decreasing non-gap residue count ensures that shorter sequences (e.g., gapped sequences) are filtered out over longer ones.\n\n\nThe sequences can be obtained through sequence-based homology searches for any of the sequence databases known in the art (e.g. NCBI, TIGR databases). In an exemplary embodiment, a standard BLAST search with default parameters may be performed with the test sequence to retrieve homologous sequences of interest. Sequences with a minimum percentage of sequence identity (e.g. greater than 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% sequence identity, preferably greater than 30% sequence identity) to the test sequence may be selected for inclusion in the reference set.\n\n\nIn certain preferred embodiments, the reference set is curated to comprise sequences from proteins having the same class of protein fold (e.g., proteins having SH3, TPR, GPCR, serine protease, aspartyl protease, globin, immunoglobulin, or other folds). Such proteins or structures may be identified and collected by bioinformatics techniques known in the art (e.g., be structure-based searching using the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) of the National Institutes of Health), or by searching the ASTRAL database or the RCSB protein database (PDB) using a desired SCOP classification). Preferably, the sequences are derived from proteins whose 3-dimensional structures have been solved at high resolution, for example, by X-ray crystallography.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, sequences corresponding to collected structures are filtered using art-recognized techniques to remove erroneously categorized, incomplete, redundant, or domain-swapped structures. In one embodiment, the structures are visually inspected (e.g., using the SwissPDB Viewer) for breaks in the corresponding sequence due to unresolved densities or domain swapping. The PDB files of faulty structures are manually removed from the corresponding set of structures. In another embodiment, sequences (e.g. FASTA sequences) corresponding to the collected structures are filtered to remove any sequences that are 100% identical, or perfect match substrings of remaining sequences. In yet other embodiments, PDB structures with aberrantly long or short amino acid sequences (a hallmark of erroneous structural categorization) are culled from the structure datasets. The length cutoff criteria may be determined, for example, by examining a histogram of all sequence lengths of sequences of the reference set. In still other embodiments, the structures are visually inspected (e.g., using the Swiss PDB viewer) for misfolding. Any structures that do not conform with the standard topology of the protein fold are preferably discarded.\n\n\nIn exemplary embodiments, the curated reference set comprises sequences corresponding to an immunoglobulin-type fold (“Ig fold”) of a protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins. As is well known in the art, the Ig fold is a distinguishing feature of the immunoglobulin superfamily (see, e.g. Bork, P., Holm, L. & Sander, C. 1994. The Immunoglobulin Fold. \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n242, 309-320). The Ig fold appears often in mammalian proteins and serves as a platform for various functions—particularly protein-protein interactions. For example, all immunoglobulins and most immunoglobulin receptors are composed of multiple Ig-fold domains. Ig folds may be subdivided into several subfamilies including C1, C2, I, and V. Although members of all the subfamilies comprise a two-β sheet, greek-key topology, these subfamilies differ by the number of β-strands on each sheet and by the connections across β-sheets (see, e.g., A F Williams, \nImmunology Today, \n8, (1987)). Representative structures for each class of Ig fold are depicted in \nFIG. 73\n.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the reference set comprises an Ig-fold sequence of an immunoglobulin superfamily protein selected from the group consisting of a cell adhesion protein, a integrin, an allergen, a T-cell receptor, a major histocompatibility complex protein (e.g., a MHC Class I or MHC Class II protein), an immunoglobulin receptor (e.g., an Fc gamma receptor (e.g. FcγRI, FcγRIIa)), and an immunoglobulin (e.g., an IgG, IgM, IgA, or IgE immunoglobulin).\n\n\nIn certain preferred embodiments, all of the sequences of the reference set correspond to an Ig-fold or portion thereof. In one embodiment, the Ig-fold is a C1 fold. In another embodiment, the Ig-fold is a C2-fold. In another embodiment, the Ig-fold is a V-fold. In yet another embodiment, the Ig-fold is an I-fold. In another embodiment, all of the sequences of the reference set correspond to a C1 fold. In another embodiment, all of the sequences of the reference set correspond to a C2-fold. In another embodiment, all of the sequences of the reference set correspond to an I-fold. In certain preferred embodiments, the sequences of Ig-fold reference set are within about 75 to about 150 residues in length.\n\n\nStep 2: Aligning the Reference Set\n\n\nIn the second step, the sequences of the reference set are precisely aligned to generate an aligned set of sequences (or alignment). In one embodiment, the sequences of the reference set are aligned using sequence alignment algorithms (e.g. LALIGN or BLAST and other art-recognized alignments described supra) to create an aligned set of sequences (herein a “sequence-based sequence alignment”). In another embodiment, structures corresponding to the sequences of the reference set are aligned using a structural alignment algorithm (e.g. Secondary Structure Matching (SSM) using the Schrödinger structalign package) to create an aligned set of structures (herein, a “structure alignment”). Preferably, the structure alignment algorithm ensures that core regions (e.g., β strands) of each structure are aligned, instead of intervening loops. In yet another embodiment, the sequences of the reference set are aligned by structure-based methods (e.g., by matching amino acids from one superimposed structure to that of another superimposed structure based on the shortest distance between the α-carbons of the polypeptide backbones, e.g., using the Schrödinger package).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the sequences of the reference set are aligned using both sequence-based and structure-based alignment algorithms. Preferably, the structures corresponding to the sequences of the reference set are first aligned using a structure-based alignment algorithm or other structure-guided alignment tools, followed by alignment of the corresponding sequences with a sequence-based algorithm. More preferably, the structures corresponding to the sequences of the reference set are first aligned, followed by alignment of the sequences using a structure-based sequence alignment.\n\n\nIn certain optional embodiments, the aligned set of sequences is further curated. For example, the aligned set of sequences can be expanded (e.g., by non-gap sorting or by Henikoff sorting) to increase its diversity (e.g., to obtain very large sets of homolgous sequences having the same fold). In other embodiments, the aligned set of sequences can be further subjected to several rounds of curation and, optionally, further alignment (e.g. structure-based alignment).\n\n\nIn certain preferred embodiments, the invention provides methods for curating an aligned set containing a relatively small number of sequences in order to enhance its diversity. By increasing the number of sequence in the alignment, the robustness of the covariation analysis is increased. In one embodiment, the methods may employ a heuristically-derived model or profile to search for additional homologous sequences from a large, publicly-available, sequence database (e.g., the NR database maintained by the NCBI). The heuristically-derived models may be produced using one or more regression-based algorithms selected from, e.g., a partial least squares regression, a multiple linear regression, an inverse least squares regression, a principal component regression, a variable importance for projection, or the like. In other embodiments, the heuristically-derived model is produced using one or more pattern-based algorithm selected from, e.g., a Hidden Markov model, a Smith Waterman algorithm, neural network, a classification and regression tree, a multivariate adaptive regression spline, or the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the pattern recognition algorithm is a Hidden Markov Model. An HMM is a statistical model where the system being modeled contains hidden parameters which can be extracted using observable parameters and employed for analysis of pattern recognition. For example, art-recognized HMMs may employ predicted secondary structures to search for antibodies of the same fold as a given antibody, rather than antibodies having purely sequence-based relatedness (see e.g., \nProteins \n36(1), 68-76). MetaFam (Silverstein et al. \nNucleic Acids Res \n29(1), 49-51 (2001)), Interpro (Apweiler, et al., \nNucleic Acids Res, \n29(1), 37-40, (2001)), and HMMER (Bateman et al, \nNucleic Acids Res \n27(1), 260-2 (1999)) are exemplary HMM-based pattern recognition tools.\n\n\nIn certain additional embodiments, sequences extracted with a HMM algorithm may be validated for their proper structural class assignment using art-recognized bioinformatics software. An exemplary validation tool is the PFAM classification tool maintained by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and is publicly available on the internet. For example, the PFAM tool ‘pfamverify’ may be applied to each extracted sequence to confirm that it was correctly classified by the class-specific HMM created from the structure-based structure alignment (Finn et al., \nNucleic Acids Res, \n24 (Database issue), D247-51, (2006). HMM profiles corresponding to a PFAM clan (or related family of proteins, e.g. an Ig-fold clan) may be downloaded from the PFAM website to facilitate scoring of the extracted sequences. Extracted sequences whose scores lay below a recommended cutoff are preferably removed from the reference set.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, sequences extracted with the HMM algorithm may also be aligned using the HMMC algorithm. Since these HMM algorithms are based upon careful structural alignments, this process insures the structure guided alignment of the additional extracted sequences. For example, the HMMER package may be utilized to generate ‘mapali’ alignments in FASTA output format.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, the method of the invention provides a novel HMM which not only finds sequences similar to those of the aligned set, but aligns the new sequences to insure the correct core region alignment. For example, the novel HMM algorithm of the invention can search for separate domains (e.g., Ig-fold domains) within a single protein (e.g., an immunoglobulin superfamily member), extract each domain separately, and add it to the aligned set of sequences. HMM algorithms or profiles may be built from structure-based sequence alignments (e.g., using the HMMER software package which is publicly available on the internet, e.g., at www.psc.edu). For each structure-specific HMM search, hit sequences above a criterion score threshold are preferably retained as candidate members of the structural class whose HMM was used. For those hit regions that are subsequences of hit sequence, the exact subsequence hit may be extracted from the full sequence.\n\n\nIn other exemplary embodiments, the invention provides methods for curating the aligned set of sequences in order to reduce its redundancy. For example, while the large number of sequences in a structurally aligned set (e.g., an Ig-fold aligned set) represents a rich source of sequences, some subfamilies (e.g., certain Ig-fold subclasses) may be highly over-represented, while other are highly under-represented. Over- or under-representation results in significant bias due to close common ancestry and limits the overall usefulness of covariation analyses. Accordingly, in preferred embodiments, the alignment is subjected to further filtering steps to reduce alignment redundancy. In preferred embodiments, at least one sequence with greater than 90% identity to another sequence (e.g., 91%, 92%, 93%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity) is removed from the alignment. In particularly preferred embodiments, at least one sequence sharing greater than 80% sequence identity with another sequence (e.g., 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 87%, 88%, 89%, or 90% sequence identity) is removed from the alignment.\n\n\nIn exemplary embodiments, the invention provides a novel method to reduce redundancy within the alignment. Such methods comprise use of a heuristic algorithm to find and rank sequences of desired sequence identity cutoff. Such methods comprise one of more of the following sequential steps: (1) calculating percent identities for all pairs of sequences in the alignment; (2) grouping identity values into one or more bins of percent identity; (3) ranking the sequences of each bin by decreasing non-gap residue count and/or by Henikoff sequence weight; and (4) removing redundant sequences according to a cutoff criterion (e.g., a % identity cutoff level).\n\n\nRemoval of the redundant sequences can be performed in a number of ways. In one embodiment, ranked sequences are grouped into multiple bins of sequence identity (e.g., a 99% bin, a 98% bin, a 97% bin, etc.). Sequences are then systematically removed by rank (e.g., highest ranked sequences first) from the highest % identity bin (ie., the 99% bin, followed by the 98% bin, followed by the 97% bin, etc.). Identity calculation, grouping and/or ranking steps (Steps (1)-(3)) are optionally repeated after each removal step until the final bin that meets the cutoff criterion is eliminated. In another embodiment, a single bin of ranked sequences is created at the cutoff criterion and sequences are systematically removed by rank from the bin. Identity calculation and/or ranking steps (Step (1) and (3)) are optionally repeated after each removal step.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, the cutoff criterion is 90% or higher (e.g., 91%, 92%, 93%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity). In particularly preferred embodiments, the cutoff criterion is 80% or higher (e.g., 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 87%, 88%, 89%, or 90% sequence identity).\n\n\nIn another optional step, the lengths of sequences in the aligned reference set may be truncated. In one embodiment, gapped regions within the alignment may be removed to avoid calculation on these less informative regions. For example, columns that are not match states in an HMM profile used to find the sequences may be removed. In another embodiment, sequences within the alignment which overlap the consensus length of the alignment are cropped to remove the overhanging portion of the sequence. In other embodiment, overlapping sequences are removed from the alignment.\n\n\nStep 3: Covariation Analysis of the Aligned Set\n\n\nOnce the sequences of the aligned set are compiled, covariation analysis is performed on one or more pairs of amino acid residues in the alignment set. The covariation analysis results in the generation of a novel dataset (herein, a “covariation dataset”) describing the statistical significance of correlated residues within the alignments. In certain embodiments, the covaration dataset lists correlations between every possible pair of residues within the alignment.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, computation of covariation is a computer-implemented process (e.g., a Java-executable process). Computation of covariation may result in several art-recognized statistical parameters. In one embodiment, the statistical significance (e.g. a χ\n2\n-value) of covariation is calculated using a Chi-square analysis. In another embodiment, the statistical strength (e.g. φ value) of covariation is calculated. For example, a negative φ value may be predictive of a negative correlation. That is, the presence of one amino acid at a first position in the alignment favors the absence of another specific amino acid at a second position. Conversely, a positive φ value may be predictive of a positive correlation, thereby indicating that the amino acid at the first position favors the presence of the amino acid at the second position.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a φ value is calculated using formula I:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nϕ\n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n=\n \n \n \n \n(\n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n*\n \n \n \na\n \n_\n \n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nb\n \n_\n \n \nj\n \n \n \n)\n \n \n-\n \n \n(\n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nb\n \n_\n \n \nj\n \n \n*\n \n \n \na\n \n_\n \n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n(\n \n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n \n+\n \n \n \n \na\n \n_\n \n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n*\n \n \n(\n \n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nb\n \n_\n \n \nj\n \n \n \n+\n \n \n \n \na\n \n_\n \n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nb\n \n_\n \n \nj\n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n*\n \n \n(\n \n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n \n+\n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nb\n \n_\n \n \nj\n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n*\n \n \n(\n \n \n \n \n \na\n \n_\n \n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n \n+\n \n \n \n \na\n \n_\n \n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \n \nb\n \n_\n \n \nj\n \n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(\n \nI\n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n\n\na\ni\nb\nj \nis the number of times residues of type “a” or “b” are found in the same sequence at positions i and j, respectively;\n\n\nā\ni\n \nb\n \nj \nis the number of times both residue types are absent from the same sequence;\n\n\na\ni\n \nb\n \nj \nis the number of times a is found present while b is absent; and\n\n\nā\ni\nb\nj \nis the number of times a is absent while b is present.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a φ value is calculated using the following formula II:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nϕ\n \n⁡\n \n \n(\n \n \n \na\n \ni\n \n \n⁢\n \n \nb\n \nj\n \n \n \n)\n \n \n \n=\n \n \n \n \n(\n \n \nc\n \n*\n \nf\n \n \n)\n \n \n-\n \n \n(\n \n \nd\n \n*\n \ne\n \n \n)\n \n \n \n \nghij\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(\n \nII\n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere c through j are defined by the matrix:\n\n \n \n \n \na\ni \nā\ni \nTotal\n \nb\nj\nc d g\n \n \nb\n \nj\ne f h\n \nTotal i j\n\n\nand\n\n\n\nc=a\n \ni\n \nb\n \nj\n \n, d=ā\n \ni\n \nb\n \nj\n \n, e=a\n \ni\n \n \nb\n \n \nj\n \n, f=ā\n \ni\n \n \nb\n \n \nj\n \n, g=c+d, h=e+f, i=c+e\n, and \nj=d+f. \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a χ\n2\n-value may be calculated using a “frequency-of-occurrence” based formula.

In preferred embodiments, however, a residue type may also include a gap as a distinct residue type, since gaps (especially in loop portion) often help to discriminate one motif from another.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the covariation calculation may include a diversity weighting function (e.g., a Henikoff weighing scheme).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, Sequence Average Identities (SAIs) may be used to filter out covarying pairs. For example, SAIs may be used to filter out covariation from pairs with greater than average sequence identity in order to remove potential artifactual covariations arising from closely related sequences. In embodiments where the alignment has been subjected to curation by a high identity threshold (e.g., 80% identity as cutoff criterion), SAI calculations are preferably dispensed with.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, covarying pairs are not reported by the calculation unless they are observed a minimum number of times (herein, an “event cutoff”). In one embodiment, the event cutoff is 10 or more events. In a more preferred embodiment, the event cutoff about 2 or more, and less than 10, events (e.g. 9, 8, 7, 6, or 5 events).\n\n\nStep 4: Using Covariation Data to Predict Protein Stability\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the statistically significant covariations within the covariation dataset are used to search for corresponding covariations within the candidate or test sequence. In particular, the conservation of one or more covariant amino acids of the reference set at corresponding amino acid positions within the candidate or test sequence indicates that these residues are functionally important and are predictive of favorable protein stability. Accordingly, the number of covariant amino acids that are conserved within a candidate or test sequence may be used to predict the stability of the sequence.\n\n\nIn certain exemplary aspects, the relevant covariations may be visualized using a graphical user interface (GUI) of the invention (e.g., the NAPMAP tool described in Section V infra) for analysis of the covariation dataset. Because interpretation of data in the covariation dataset may be cumbersome, the graphical user interface may ease data analysis and facilitate rapid protein designs and functional analyses.\n\n\nIn exemplary embodiments, the presence or absence of covariant residues within the reference set or alignment that are present or absent within the candidate sequence can be used to establish a score which is correlative with protein stability. For example, where a covariant (e.g., positively covariant) pair of residues is found to be retained within the candidate sequence, a first score (e.g. a positive score) can be assigned to the candidate sequence. Conversely, where a covariant (e.g., positively covariant) pair of residues is missing from the candidate sequence, a second score of appositive sign to the first score (e.g., a negative score) can be assigned to the candidate sequence. In one preferred embodiment, the absence of a negatively covariant pair of residues within a test sequence is assigned a positive score, while the presence of the negatively covariant pair of residues is assigned a negative score. In another preferred embodiment, the presence of a positively covariant pair of residues of a test sequence is assigned a positive score, while the absence of a positively covariant pair test sequence residues is assigned a negative score.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, covariation scores are generated only for covariations that satisfy a threshold level of statistical significance. In one embodiment, covariation scores are generated only for covariations above (or below) a certain χ\n2\n-value or φ value. For example, the cutoff for designation of negative covariation score may be a covaration with a phi association coefficient (Φ) of less than +0.2 (about +0.2 to about −1.0), and more preferable less than −0.2. In another exemplary embodiment, a covariation is assigned a positive covariation score if it has a phi association coefficient of greater than −0.2, preferably greater than +0.2. In preferred embodiments, a negative covariation score is assigned to a covariation with a phi association coefficient (Φ) of less than −0.5 (e.g., −0.5, −0.6, −0.7, −0.8, −0.9, or −1.0), and a positive covariation score is assigned to a covaration with a phi association coefficient (Φ) of greater than +0.5 (e.g., +0.5, +0.6, +0.7, +0.8, +0.9, or +1.0), while all other covariations are masked by assigning a neutral score (e.g., zero).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the negative or positive covariation score can be weighted to reflect the statistical significance or strength of the corresponding covariation. In one exemplary embodiment, a positive covariation can be assigned a high positive covariation score if its phi association coefficient is also high or a lower positive covariation score its φ value is low. For example, a candidate sequence having first and second covariations with respective φ values of +0.5 and +1.0 may be assigned a low positive covariation score (e.g., +1) for the first covariation and a higher positive covariation score for the second covariation (e.g., +2).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the covariation score is assigned only to those covariations which are validated by a means other than calculated statistical significance. Several non-statistical criteria may be used to validate that the calculated covariations are significant and biologically meaningful. In one embodiment, the covariation is validated by examining whether there is correlation or trend between residues that covary with each other and their proximity to each other within a structural model of the corresponding protein. If said residues are close in proximity (e.g. 30 Å or less, preferably 10 Å or less) to each other in the structure, the predicted covariation is validated as a true covariation. In another embodiment, the covariation is validated by determining whether the covarying amino acids form a connection which is already known to exist within a subset of proteins corresponding to sequences of the reference set (e.g., a known disulfide bond). For example, residues 6-10 at the N-terminus of human or murine IgG variable heavy chain folds are known to adopt very specific conformations based on the conservation of covarying pairs of amino acids (Ewert et al., \nMethods, \n34: 184-199 (2004)).\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, a covariation score of an amino acid in a candidate sequence can be weighted to reflect the number of covariations within the reference set or alignment that is satisfies (or violates). In one embodiment, the candidate sequence is assigned a positive covariation score for each covariation within the reference set or alignment that it satisfies, and a negative covariation score for each covariation within the reference set that it violates. In preferred embodiments, the covariation score for a particular amino acid of a test sequence is the sum total of the positive covariation scores offset by the sum total of the negative covariation scores. For example, where 2 negative covariations and 9 positive covariations are observed within the reference set at amino acid positions corresponding to the amino acid of the candidate sequence, the candidate sequence amino acid may be assigned a total covariation score of 7.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a total covariation scores are summed for all the amino acids in a candidate sequence (or portion thereof) to obtain a “sequence covariation score”. This sequence covariation score may be employed to predict the stability of the sequence. Generally, a negative sequence covariation score is predictive of low protein stability, whereas a positive sequence covariation score is predictive of high protein stability.\n\n\nb. Consensus Scoring\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the computational methods of the invention employ a novel scoring technique termed “consensus-based scoring” which compares candidate polypeptide sequences against a database of related polypeptide sequences to identify proteins with potentially low stability. As used herein “consensus-based scoring” refers to calculation of the number of non-consensus amino acids within a protein (e.g., a test protein) based on the information available from sequence compilations of related proteins. The calculation results in a “consensus score” for the protein. As shown in the Examples infra, the consensus score of a protein is highly correlative with its empirically-determined protein stability. Accordingly, an object of the invention is to employ consensus-based scoring to predict protein stability. The greater the deviation of a test protein sequence from a consensus sequence, the higher the consensus score, and the more likely the test protein is to contain amino acids detrimental to its stability.\n\n\nIn the novel consensus scoring approach described herein, the following basic steps are taken to predict the stability of a candidate or test protein:\n\n \n \n \n \n1. Providing a set of homologous sequences (herein, a “reference set”) corresponding to a sequence of a domain (or portion thereof) of the candidate protein (herein a “test domain sequence”).\n \n2. Determining the residue frequency at every residue position within the test domain sequence (or portion thereof) to obtain a consensus score.\n \n3. Using the consensus score to predict the stability of the candidate or test protein.\n \n \n \n\n\nIn certain exemplary embodiments, the following optional steps are employed to increase the predictive value of the consensus score:\n\n \n \n \n \n4. Determining the residue frequency at every corresponding residue position within every sequence of the reference set (or a subset thereof) obtain an average score.\n \n5. Comparing the consensus score to the average consensus score to determine a sequence score.\n \n6. Using the sequence score to predict the stability of the candidate or test protein.\n \n \n \n\n\nStep 1: Providing a Reference Set\n\n\nThe consensus scoring based methods of the invention employ a set of sequences (a “reference set”) which are homologous to (i.e., related to) a sequence of interest or “test sequence”. The reference set may comprise a set of homologous sequences having moderate to high degrees of similarity with the test sequence.\n\n\nThe set of homologous sequences may be determined by one skilled in the art to include a suitable number of non-redundant sequences. The set of homologous sequences need not be large, as long as a reasonably unbiased selection is obtained. It is not the number of sequences, but the ratio of frequencies that is important.\n\n\nSuch sequences can be obtained through homology-based searches of any of the sequence databases known in the art (e.g. NCBI, TIGR databases). In an exemplary embodiment, a standard BLAST search with default parameters may be performed with the test sequence to retrieve homologous sequences of interest. Sequences with a minimum percentage of sequence identity (e.g. greater than 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% sequence identity, preferably greater than 30% sequence identity) may be selected for inclusion in the reference set. In certain embodiments, those sequences with a high degree of sequence identity (e.g., greater than 85%, 90%, 95%, or 98% sequence identity, preferably greater than 95% sequence identity) are excluded from the reference set to avoid bias.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the reference set may be curated to include only those sequences which satisfy one or more criteria for inclusion in the set. For example, in certain embodiments, the reference set may comprise ortholog sequences (e.g. sequences which are from different species (e.g., different mammalian species) but which have the same biochemical function). In other embodiments, the reference set comprises human sequences. In an exemplary embodiment, the set of homologous sequences includes only mammalian germline sequences. In preferred embodiments, the reference set includes sequences from proteins having the same class of protein fold (e.g. a similar protein domain) to the test protein (e.g. proteins having an immunoglobulin-type fold). Such proteins may be identified by bioinformatics techniques known in the art (e.g., be searching the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) of the National Institutes of Health).\n\n\nStep 2: Determining the Consensus Score of the Test Sequence\n\n\nOnce the sequences of the reference set are compiled, the consensus sequence of the reference set is determined in order to facilitate the consensus scoring method of the invention. As used herein, the term “consensus sequence” refers to a sequence wherein the residue (e.g. amino acid residue) at each position within the sequence corresponds to the most common residue at that position in an aligned set of related sequences (i.e., the reference set).\n\n\nTo determine the consensus sequence, the sequences within the reference set may first be aligned using sequence alignment algorithms known in the art. A preferred, non-limiting example of a local alignment algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul (1990) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n87:2264-68, modified as in Karlin and Altschul (1993) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n90:5858-77. Such an algorithm is incorporated into the BLAST programs (version 2.0) of Altschul, et al. (1990) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n215:403-10. In another embodiment, the alignment is optimized by introducing appropriate gaps and percent identity is determined over the length of the aligned sequences (i.e., a gapped alignment). To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al., (1997) \nNucleic Acids Res. \n25(17):3389-3402. In another embodiment, the alignment is optimized by introducing appropriate gaps and percent identity is determined over the entire length of the sequences aligned (i.e., a global alignment). A preferred, non-limiting example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the global comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller, \nCABIOS \n(1989). Such an algorithm is incorporated into the ALIGN program (version 2.0) which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package. When utilizing the ALIGN program for comparing amino acid sequences, a PAM120 weight residue table, a gap length penalty of 12, and a gap penalty of 4 can be used.\n\n\nTo determine the consensus sequence of the aligned set of references, the most frequently occurring residue at each position within the aligned set of references is determined. The consensus sequence may be determined visually or it may be determined by computational analysis using a publicly available bioinformatics program (e.g., the EMBOSS CONS tool available from the Helix Systems of the National Institute of Health).\n\n\nThe consensus sequence is employed in the methods of the invention to determine a consensus score. In certain embodiments, a consensus score is a numerical value which equates the residue frequency or occurrence within the reference set of the consensus residue at each amino acid position in the consensus sequence (ie. the “consensus residue frequency”) with the residue frequency or occurrence within the reference set of the amino acid at the corresponding position in the test sequence (ie. the “test residue frequency”). Residue frequencies at a position within the test or consensus sequence are calculated by summing the number of times the amino acid at that position is present at the corresponding position in the aligned reference set, and dividing the summed value by the total number of sequences within the reference set. In an exemplary embodiment, the consensus score at each amino acid position is calculated by dividing the test residue frequency by the consensus residue frequency to give a non-zero score of between 1 and 0. For example, a residue which is identical to the consensus amino acid at that position is assigned a perfect score of 1, while a consensus score approaches zero, the less common the amino acid is at that position.\n\n\nIn certain preferred embodiments, the consensus score may be summed for each position of the test sequence (or a portion thereof) to obtain a total consensus score. For example, a perfect total consensus score is the number of amino acids in the test sequence, indicating that the test sequence is identical to its corresponding consensus sequence.\n\n\nAn exemplary formula for calculating the total consensus score of a protein is set forth below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscore\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n∑\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n⁡\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nr\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n⁡\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nr\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein\n\n\nc\ni\n(r) equals the consensus residue frequency at an amino acid position of the consensus sequence,\n\n\nh\ni\n(r) equals the test residue frequency of an amino acid position of the test sequence, and\n\n\ni equals the number of amino acid positions within the test sequence.\n\n\nStep 3: Using the Consensus Score to Predict Protein Stability\n\n\nThe consensus score may then be employed to predict the stability of the test protein. In general, the higher the value of the consensus score, the greater the probability that the test protein will have adequate stability for its intended use. In certain embodiments, the consensus score of the test protein may be compared with the consensus score of a control sequence. In one exemplary embodiment, the control sequence is from a protein which is known to have poor or undesired stability properties (herein, a “negative control”). Accordingly, the test protein is predicted to have improved stability if its consensus score is higher than that of the negative control. In another exemplary embodiment, the control sequence is from a protein which is known to have desirable stability properties (herein, a “positive control”). Accordingly, the test protein is predicted to have improved stability if its consensus score is substantially similar or higher than that of the positive control. In other embodiments, the consensus score of the test sequence may be compared with its hypothetical perfect consensus score, a value which corresponds to the total number of amino acids in the test sequence.\n\n\nStep 4: Determining the Average Consensus Score of the Reference Set\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, average consensus scores at some or all of the amino acid positions of the sequences within the reference set are determined for comparison with the consensus scores at corresponding positions within the test sequence. In preferred embodiments, the average total consensus score for the reference set is determined for comparison with the total consensus score of the of the test sequence. The average total consensus score for the reference set is the sum of the residue frequencies for all amino acid positions of a sequence within the reference set, divided by the total number of sequences in there reference set.\n\n\nStep 5: Determining the Sequence Score\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the sequence score is determined by comparing the average consensus score of the reference set with the consensus score of the test sequence. The differential of these values is the “sequence score” of the test sequence (also referred to herein as the “A score”). The sequence score may be determined by subtracting the consensus score from the average consensus score.\n\n\nStep 6: Using the Sequence Score to Predict Protein Stability\n\n\nThe sequence score provides a measure of the deviation of the consensus score of the test sequence from the average consensus score of the reference set. The Examples infra demonstrate that the sequence score of a protein is highly correlated with the stability (e.g. thermal stability) of the protein. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the sequence score may also be used to predict the stability of the protein. If the Δ score of the protein is a negative value (ie. the consensus score is lower than the average consensus score), the prediction would be that the stability of the protein of interest will have a lower stability than the majority of proteins within the reference set.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the test sequences employed in the methods of the invention are single-domain proteins. As used herein, a “single domain protein” is a protein comprising one or more domains, wherein each of the domains are of the same type (e.g. a variable heavy (VH) domain).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the test sequences employed in the methods of the invention are multi-domain proteins. As used herein, a “multi-domain protein” is a protein comprising two or more domains, where at least two of the domains are of a different type. For example, antibodies are proteins typically comprising six domains (i.e., VH, VL, CL, CH1, CH2, and CH3). In preferred embodiments, the stability of the least stable domain of a multi-domain protein is predicted using the methods of the invention. The Examples infra demonstrate that the methods of the invention are particularly effective in predicting thermal stability when the least stable domain (or portion thereof) of a multi-domain protein (e.g. the VH domain of an antibody) is employed as a test sequence.\n\n\nIf the least stable domain is not known a priori, it can be determined using experimental methods that are known in the art (e.g. using any of the methods described supra, such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), temperature dependent circular dichroism (CD), or fluorescence measurements). Such methods allow for the determination of multiple thermal unfolding transitions where the least stable domain either unfolds first (see \nFIG. 69A\n) or limits the overall stability threshold of a multidomain unit that unfolds cooperatively (i.e. a multidomain protein which exhibits a single unfolding transition). The least stable domain can be identified in a number of additional ways. Mutagenesis can be performed to probe which domain limits the overall stability. Additionally, protease resistance of a multidomain protein can be performed under conditions where the least stable domain is known to be intrinsically unfolded via DSC or other spectroscopic methods (Fontana, et al., \nFold. Des., \n2: R17-26, 1997). Once the least stable domain is identified, the sequence encoding this domain (or a portion thereof) may be employed as a test sequence in the methods of the invention.\n\n\nIn certain exemplary embodiments, the multi-domain proteins evaluated using the methods of the invention are antibodies. The methods of the invention allow one skilled in the art to exclude the selection of inappropriate variable region domains from among the vast pool of variable region sequences created by the diversity mechanisms of the immune system. In exemplary embodiments, e.g., scFv molecules or antibody molecules comprising variable region (Fv) domains with a relatively high stability (e.g. thermal stability) may be identified using the methods of the invention, and selected. In other exemplary embodiments, human immunoglobulin variable region (Fv) domains having acceptable stability may be identified using the methods of the invention and selected for use as acceptor immunoglobulin chains in the humanization of an antibody. In other exemplary embodiments, the methods of the invention may be employed to screen candidate engineered antibody variable sequences (e.g., humanized VL or VH sequences) for appropriate stability before proceeding with the synthesis of a binding molecule comprising the candidate sequence.\n\n\nAs is known in the art, protein stability varies from one antibody to another based on the many possible variations in natural or engineered antibodies. For example, the selective pressure of the immune system to create diversity within the variable domains of natural antibody can negatively affect their stability or foldability in recombinant expression systems (Knappik and Pluckthun, \nProtein Engng., \n8: 81-89, (1995); Wall and Pluckthun, \nProtein Engng, \n12: 605-11 (1999); Knappik et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n296: 57-86, (2000); Ewert et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n3325: 531-33, (2003)). Antibodies consisting of the same isotype and subclass, human IgG1 being the most commonly used for antibody therapeutics, vary in stability from one another primarily based on differences in their variable domains since the remainder of their sequences are identical. Thermal unfolding of antibody Fab fragments predominantly occurs in a single apparent transition. In most cases, the antibody Fv region limits the overall thermostability of the Fab except in the rare cases where Fv (or single V\nH \nor V\nL\n) stability is extremely low or extremely high and the Fv unfolding transition is decoupled from that of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1/CL region (Shimba, et al., 1995; Röthlisberger et al., 2005).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the methods of the invention employ a variable region sequence of an antibody as a test sequence. In certain preferred embodiments, the methods of the invention employ the heavy chain variable domain (VH) (or a portion thereof) as a test sequence. The Examples infra demonstrate that the VH domain is highly predictive of the stability of an antibody comprising said domain.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the variable domain test sequence is compared with a reference set comprising, or consisting solely of, variable domain sequences. Said variable domain sequences may be compiled from the Kabat database of immunoglobulin sequences (Kabat et al., “Distribution Files of the Fifth Edition of Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest”, 1992). In certain preferred embodiments, the reference set may comprise or consist of human immunoglobulin sequences.\n\n\nIn other preferred embodiments, the reference set may comprise, or consist solely of, human germline sequences. In one embodiment, the reference comprises variable domain sequences from the same Kabat subclass of antibody sequences.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, a portion of variable domain (e.g. VH domain) is used as a test sequence in the methods of the invention. An exemplary variable domain portion is a sequence comprising less than all of the framework regions or CDRs of the variable region sequence (e.g. a VH sequence that is truncated to remove CDR3 and FR4). In one embodiment, the VH domain sequences are of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n1 Kabat germline subclass. In another embodiment, the variable domain sequences are of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n2 Kabat germline subclass. In another embodiment, the variable domain sequences are of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 Kabat germline subclass. In another embodiment, the variable domain sequences are of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n4 Kabat germline subclass. In another embodiment, the variable domain sequences are of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n5 Kabat germline subclass. In another embodiment, the variable domain sequences are of the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n7 Kabat germline subclass.\n\n\nThe methods of invention may be employed with proteins known in the art. In one embodiment, the protein is an antibody or portion thereof. In certain embodiments, the antibody is a humanized antibody. In other embodiments, the antibody is a human antibody. In other embodiments, the antibody is a non-human antibody (e.g., mouse monoclonal antibody). In other embodiments, the antibody is a single-domain antibody (e.g., camelid, shark, human). In yet other embodiments, the antibody is a chimeric antibody. Other exemplary modified antibodies for use in the methods of the invention include domain-deleted antibodies and bispecific binding molecules. Other exemplary antibodies include the scFv-containing antibodies or modified antibodies described supra. In preferred embodiments, the stability of the aforementioned binding proteins is evaluated using a heavy chain variable sequence thereof (or portion thereof) as the test sequence in the methods of the invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, of the invention, the data obtained for a given polypeptide are stored or outputted as a measure of the stability of the polypeptide. In one embodiment, the methods described herein can be repeated for a plurality of polypeptides. In one embodiment, a selection of a polypeptide may be made based on the data obtained. In another embodiment, a selected polypeptide may be formulated for therapeutic use.\n\n\nIV. Methods for Designing/Producing Proteins with Enhanced Biophysical Properties (e.g., Protein Stability)\n\n\n(a) Covariation Design\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods for designing protein variants with an enhanced biophysical property relative to the parent molecule from which it is derived using the results of a covariation analysis. There are many types of protein engineering efforts where covariation data may be used to facilitate design, including but not limited to enhanced protein stability designs, modification of pH unfolding profiles, stable removal of glycosylation, and alteration of biochemical function.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the invention provides methods for designing proteins with enhanced stability designs based on the identification of covariation scores (or covariations themselves) that are predictive of enhanced or reduced protein stability according the method of Section III supra. For example, if a sequence belonging to the protein of interest is missing or violates several key covariations, protein designs can be made to correct for this. Modifications can also be included which improve the calculated number of strong covariations observed within a single sequence.\n\n\nA number of designs have been developed for stabilizing the BHA10 scFv V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains. In particular, initial library screening results for two scFv BHA10 domains validate the ability of the Covariation Analysis Tool for protein stability design. The first example involves the successful prediction of a stabilizing mutation (S46L) within the BHA10 V\nL \ndomain that imparts a significant improvement in thermal stability (ΔT\n50 \nof +10° C.) as measured by a thermal challenge assay. Mutation from Ser to Leu at position 46 (Kabat numbering system) leads to a positive connection to an existing Tyr at \nresidue\n 36 which the Tool shows covaries strongly with Leu 46 (\nFIG. 78\n). A second example of the utility of the Covariation Analysis Tool is the analytical agreement of the negative effects of a BHA11 V\nH \nQ6E mutation. Single residue frequency analysis suggested that mutation to the much more commonly observed Glu at this position would lead to an increase in stability. However, the Covariation Analysis Tool indicated that single mutation to Glu violates several existing covariations present within the BHA10 V\nH \nsequence. To obtain an improvement in stability one must replace several amino acids that preferentially stabilize Glu at this position.\n\n\nAnother example of the predictive value of the Covariation Analysis Tool is shown in \nFIG. 79\n. \nMet\n 80 was mutated to Leu as part of a single residue library design. It was thought that this single mutation would be highly stabilizing, as Leu is the most frequent amino acid observed at this position within the sequence database. However, covariation analyses indicate that two other amino acids must be mutated (V67F and T70S) in order to achieve covariation harmony.\n\n\n(b) Interface Design\n\n\nIn yet other aspects, the invention provides methods for enhancing a biophysical property (e.g., protein stability) of a second or candidate protein (e.g., an antibody) using a first protein as a template protein for rational design.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “template protein”, refers to a protein with a desirable biophysical property (e.g., high protein thermal stability) which is used to model the same property in a second protein for an improvement of the biophysical property is also desirable. In preferred embodiments, the template protein is of the same structural class as the second protein (e.g., if the second protein is an antibody, an antibody is employed as a template protein).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the template protein is identified as having desirable biophysical property (e.g., protein stability) according to a method of the invention. In one exemplary embodiment, the template protein with desirable stability properties may have been identified from a group of proteins (Such as BIIB1-4, described in Table 20, supra) using experimental methods such as those described in Example 15. This template protein would then serve as a sequence platform for design. In one exemplary embodiment, the template protein is predicted to have an improved biophysical property (e.g, protein stability) by a covariation analysis method of the invention outlined supra. In other exemplary embodiments, the template protein is predicted to be a desirable protein (e.g., a stabilized protein) according to a consensus scoring method as outlined supra. In yet another exemplary embodiment, the template protein is identified according to a screening method of the invention.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the template protein is a protein designed according to a method of the invention. In one exemplary embodiment, the template protein is designed to have an improved biophysical property (e.g., enhanced protein stability) according to a covariation method of the invention. In another exemplary embodiment, the template protein is designed to have an improved biophysical property according a consensus scoring method.\n\n\nThe methods of this aspect of the invention involve the following steps:\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) providing structural models of the template protein and the candidate protein;\n \n(2) identifying residues in the template protein that are important for stability; and\n \n(3) substituting residues in the candidate protein that correspond to the important residues template protein.\n \n \n \n\n\nIn one embodiment, the template protein structural model is a crystal structure (e.g., an X-ray crystal structure) and the candidate protein is modeled by homology modeling using the structural model of the template protein.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, an important residue is a VH/VL interface residue. As used herein, an “interface residue” is a residue that participates in domain-domain interactions within or among proteins. Preferably, an interface residue resides at the boundary, i.e., the “interface” between two protein domains and contributes its surface area to at least one of the domains (preferably both). The residues that bury significantly more surface area than others at the interface, i.e., the residues which do not expose significantly more of their surface area to the surface of the folded protein, are considered to be more crucial to interface stability. The surface area that each residue contributes to the interface can be determined using art-recognized techniques (e.g., analysis using MOLMOL software). In certain embodiments, the interface residue buries at least 10 Å\n2 \nof surface area (e.g, 10 Å\n2\n, 15 Å\n2\n, 20 Å\n2\n, 25 Å\n2 \nor more of buried surface area).\n\n\nResidues of the candidate protein located at amino acid positions corresponding to those of the important residues (e.g., buried interface residues) of the template protein are preferably substituted if they are of a non-identical type. In certain embodiments, only non-conservative substitutions are made. In other embodiments, only conservative substitutions are made.\n\n\nIn exemplary embodiments, the template and candidate proteins are binding molecules (e.g., antibodies or variants thereof (e.g. scFv molecules)). In one embodiment, the interface that is examined is that between one Fc domain (e.g., hinge, CH2, and CH3) and another Fc domain. In another embodiment, the interface is that formed between the V\nH \ndomain and the V\nL \ndomain.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, the designs are focused on the interface between the VH and VL domains of an antibody. Biophysical data (see DSC data—Example 15) suggest that the affinity of VH and VL for one another is marginal in the scFv format (i.e. in the absence of the CH1 and CL domains of the Fab). In particular, VH and VL interactions are not always strong enough (i.e. do not have sufficient affinity to lead to a cooperatively folded single entity. Therefore, improving the stability of the VH/VL interface (ie. increasing the affinity between the VH and VL domains) may be a preferred route to enhancing antibody/scFv stability. By stabilizing the interface, the folding transition of antibody can be turned into a single event, raise the affinity of the domains for one another, and allowing for less dynamic fluctuations that may lead to exposed hydrophobic surface area (as observed by ANS-binding experiments).\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the designs may be validated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments which allow one skilled in the art to non-quantitatively observe real affinity increases between the VH and VL.\n\n\n(c) Combined Covariation and Interface Design\n\n\nIn yet other aspects of the invention, two or more of the sequence based design tools described herein may be employed for the design of optimized protein variants. In one exemplary embodiment, interface design is employed together with covariation analysis to determine residues or residue positions which are important for protein structure and function, including, for example, protein stability. In one exemplary embodiment, covariation analysis is used to determine residues or residue positions outside an interface (herein, termed “scaffolding residues”) that do not physically interact with the interface residues on the opposing domain or contribute surface area to the interface, but are nonetheless important for providing proper structural context for interface residues. For example, covariation analysis may be conducted on residues located within the interface to identify scaffolding residues which covary with the interface residues. Preferably, interface residues which bury a high degree of surface area (e.g., residues that bury at least 40 Å\n2 \nof surface area) are selected for covariation analysis. Scaffolding residues which covary with the selected interface residues are then identified using the covariation methods of the invention. Preferably, scaffolding residues which strongly covary (e.g., phi-value of at least 0.25) are selected. In another preferred embodiment, scaffolding residues are selected if they covary with at least two interface residues (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more interface residues). The greater the number of covariations, the higher the covariation score may be attributed to the scaffolding residue, since the number of covariations is predictive of the contribution made by the scaffolding residue to stabilization of the VH/VL interface.\n\n\nThe methods of this aspect of the invention involve the following steps:\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) providing structural models of a template protein and a candidate protein;\n \n(2) identifying interface residues (e.g., VH/VL) in the template protein that are important for stability;\n \n(3) identifying scaffolding residues which covary with the interface residues of step (2), e.g., using the Covariation Analysis Tool described herein;\n \n(4) substituting one or more interface residues or scaffolding residues in the candidate protein with the corresponding residues or scaffolding residues identified in steps (2) and (3).\n \n \n \n\n\nResidues of the candidate protein located at amino acid positions corresponding to those of the important residues (e.g., interface or scaffolding residues) of the template protein are preferably substituted if they are of a non-identical type. In certain embodiments, only non-conservative substitutions are made. In other embodiments, only conservative substitutions are made.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, of the invention, the improved sequence of a given polypeptide is stored or outputted. In another embodiment, a selected polypeptide may be formulated for therapeutic use.\n\n\nV. Systems, Interfaces, and Computer-Implemented Methods\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention pertains to methods (e.g., computer-implemented methods), apparatus, and software for implementing the selection or design methods of the invention. In exemplary embodiments, the invention provides a computer-implemented method and apparatus for identifying amino acid residues (e.g., covariant amino acid residues) in a candidate sequence. In another embodiment, the invention provides computer-implemented methods and apparatus for ranking one or more test or candidate sequences by a score (e.g., a consensus score or covariation score) which is predictive of a biophysical property (e.g., protein stability, catalytic activity, therapeutic activity, resistance to a pathogen or toxin, toxicity, etc).\n\n\nThe computer implemented methods aspect may be described by the following sequence of operations: (a) receiving data (e.g., sequence or structural data) characterizing a reference set and a test sequence; (b) from the data, calculating a score (e.g., a covariation score or consensus score); (c) ranking the scores to identify one or more sequences or amino acid residues of interest.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the scores are ranked to identify one or more amino acid residues that are to remain fixed in the test or candidate sequence. In other embodiments, the scores are ranked to identify one or more amino acid residues which are candidates for substitution. In one exemplary embodiment, the computer-implemented method ranks residue positions (or specific residues at certain positions) in order of covariation score. In another exemplary embodiment, the computer implemented method ranks candidate sequences in order of consensus score.\n\n\nYet another aspect of the invention pertains to apparatus and machine-readable media on which are provided program instructions and/or arrangements of data for implementing the methods described above. Frequently, the program instructions are provided as code for performing certain method operations. Data, if employed to implement features of this invention, may be provided as data structures, database tables, data objects, or other appropriate arrangements of specified information. Any of the methods or systems of this invention may be represented, in whole or in part, as such program instructions and/or data provided on machine-readable media.\n\n\nThe computer-implemented methods of the invention may include an output device that displays information to a user (e.g., a CRT display, an LCD, a printer, a communication device such as a modem, audio output, and the like). In addition, instructions (e.g. an algorithm) for carrying out the calculation, in part or in whole, can be conferred to a medium suitable for use in an electronic device for carrying out the instructions. Thus, the methods of the invention are amenable to a high throughput approach comprising software (e.g., computer-readable instructions) and hardware (e.g., computers, robotics, and chips). The computer-implemented process is not limited to a particular computer platform, particular processor, or particular high-level programming language.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the calculations used in the methods of the invention are carried out by a computer algorithm suitable for use with a computer programming language (e.g. PERL). In exemplary embodiments, the computer algorithm is designed to recognize (i) a sequence alignment of a reference set and/or (ii) one or more test sequences as input for the algorithm.\n\n\n(i) Computer-Implemented Consensus Scoring\n\n\nIn one aspect of the invention pertains to computer-implemented methods, apparatus, and software for conducting the consensus scoring method of the invention described supra using a computer-implemented algorithm. In exemplary embodiments, the algorithm is designed to perform one or more of the following steps: (1) cutting out each residue position of the alignment as a column and calculating the consensus residue frequency at that position; (2) cutting off each residue position of the test sequence(s) and calculating the test residue frequency at that position, and (3) dividing the test residue frequency by the consensus residue frequency to give a consensus score; and/or (4) summing the consensus score at each position to give a total consensus score. In other embodiments, the algorithm may be designed to perform one or more of the following additional steps: (5) calculating the average consensus score of the reference set, and/or (6) the sequence score of the test sequence.\n\n\nThese aspects of the invention are also embodied in a system for conducting the consensus scoring method of the invention. The system includes (a) a computer that includes a database capable of storing at least one population of reference sets, and (b) system software. The system software includes one or more logic instructions for conducting any of steps (1)-(6) of the computer-implemented consensus scoring method.\n\n\nThe invention also provides a computer program product for conducting the consensus scoring method of the invention. The computer program product includes a computer-readable medium having one or more logic instructions for conducting any of steps (1)-(6).\n\n\n(ii) Computer-Implemented Covariation Analysis\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention pertains to computer-implemented methods for conducting the covariation analysis method of the invention as described supra using a computer-implemented algorithm. In exemplary embodiments, the methods perform one or more of the following steps: (1) cutting out each residue position of the aligned set as a column; (2) arranging columns in a matrix; (3) calculating correlation among various columns in the matrix to derive a correlative term; (4) adding correlative terms to linear terms, which correspond to amino acid residues, to generate an expanded predictor matrix; (5) generating a heuristically-derived model (e.g. a hidden Markov model) from the expanded predictor matrix to identify important correlations.\n\n\nThese aspects of the invention are also embodied in a system for conducting the covariation analysis method of the invention. The system includes (a) a computer that includes a database capable of storing at least one population of character string libraries, and (b) system software. The system software includes one or more logic instructions for conducting any of steps (1)-(5) of the computer-implemented method covariation scoring method.\n\n\nThe invention also provides a computer program product for conducting the covariation scoring method of the invention. The computer program product includes a computer-readable medium having one or more logic instructions for conducting any of steps (1)-(5).\n\n\n(iii) Graphical User Interfaces for Covariation Analysis\n\n\nIn certain exemplary aspects, the invention provides a novel graphical user interface (GUI) for use with the covariation methods of the invention. This covariation analysis tool, termed NAPMAP, assists the user in visualizing covariations in the context of aligned set of sequences. The novel graphical user interface is computer implemented using art-recognized programming languages (e.g. in Java 1.4.2 utilizing the Processing library from processing.org).\n\n\n(a) Grid Layouts\n\n\nIn one aspect, the graphical user interface of the invention comprises a graphical depiction of an alignment (e.g., a sequence alignment created according to the methods of the invention supra) or data corresponding thereto. A simple form of this display is the grid layout. As used herein, the term “grid layout” (also known as an alignment platform) refers to a matrix in which the properties of an alignment are represented. In one embodiment, the grid layout graphically represents residue positions of the sequences of an alignment. In another embodiment, the grid layout graphically represents residue types of sequences within the alignment. In another embodiment, the grid layout graphically represents the frequency of residue types (or “residue usage frequency”) within the alignment. In yet other embodiments, the grid layout represents one or more properties of residues within the alignment (e.g., hydrophobicity, charge, size, pKa, etc.).\n\n\nIn certain exemplary embodiments, the grid layout comprises a representative display of (i) contiguous residue positions corresponding to a sequence of the alignment; and (ii) residue usage frequencies for residue types at each residue position of the alignment sequence. In one embodiment, the residue usage frequency is symbolically depicted (e.g., by a circle or square). In other embodiments, all 20 natural amino acids, gaps, and ambiguous residues are represented. In certain embodiments, the residue positions are displayed in rows and the residue usage frequencies are displayed in columns. In certain embodiments, the residue positions are displayed in columns and the residue usage frequencies are displayed in rows.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the residue use frequency is correlated (e.g., positively or negatively correlated) with symbol size (e.g., size of circle), so that more conserved residues can be discriminated from less frequently observed residues. For example, residue frequency may be represented as circles of various sizes with circle area proportional to the frequency of its usage. The radius of each circle (R) may be used for drawing the node using an ellipse function calculated according to the following formula (IV)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nR\n \n=\n \n \n \n \nA\n \n·\n \n \nN\n \nM\n \n \n \nπ\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(\n \nIV\n \n)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein:\n\n\n\nA=desired average area of all nodes\n\n\nN=number of sequences using this residue\n\n\nM=the average number of sequences using each residue\n\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, the grid layout comprises a matrix of contiguous columns and rows wherein (i) contiguous columns graphically represent corresponding contiguous residue positions of the alignment; (ii) each of the contiguous rows graphically represent a specific amino acid type; and (iii) the residue usage frequency at each residue position is graphically represented in each cell of the matrix. Preferably all residue types (e.g., all 20 amino acids and/or possible gaps) are represented by a separate row in the grid layout. More preferably, residue usage frequency at each residue position of the alignment is graphically represented in each cell of the matrix with a symbol (e.g., a circle) whose size is correlated (e.g., positively correlated) with residue usage frequency. An exemplary grid layout is depicted in \nFIG. 76\n.\n\n\n(b) Covariation Overlays\n\n\nIn other aspects, the graphical user interface of the invention comprises a graphical depiction of one or more covariations (e.g., covariations identified according to the methods of the invention supra) or data corresponding thereto.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the graphical user interface of the invention comprises graphical depicts of both (i) a grid layout; and (ii) one or more covariations. In these embodiments, the grid layout may serve as alignment platform for the display of covariation data. Covariation data may be displayed, for example, by overlaying the grid layout with covariation data. Covariation data arranged in this fashion are termed a “covariation overlay”. For example, covariations may be depicted in the covariation overlay as lines or network of lines connecting two or more covarying amino acids that are graphically depicted within the grid layout.\n\n\nThe lines of the covariation overlay may be of various thicknesses (e.g., thin lines or bars) or continuities (e.g., dashed or solid, straight or jagged), so long as the connection between two or more covarying amino acids is apparent to the user (see, e.g., \nFIG. 77\n, wherein covariations are depicted as semi-transparent bars that connect two covarying amino acids). In certain exemplary embodiments, the graphical representation of the covariation may further represent the statistical significance of the covariation (e.g., its φ or χ\n2\n-value). In one exemplary embodiment, the thickness of a line within the covariation overlay may be proportional to the statistical significance of the covariation. For example, the line thickness of the covariation overlay may be drawn in proportion to φ value according to formula V:\n\n\n\nW=\n1+(\nM·Φ\n \nN\n)  (V)\n\n\n\nwherein:\n\n\nW=line thickness\n\n\nΦ=phi (correlation coefficient)\n\n\nN=exaggeration multiplier\n\n\nM=max line thickness\n\n\nIn another exemplary embodiment, positive and negative covariations may be graphically discriminated from each other (e.g., by different colored lines or thicknesses). In yet other exemplary embodiments, only covariations above a certain threshold level of statistical significance are displayed to the user. For example, in certain embodiments, φ value cutoffs may be applied to view only covariations with desired correlation strengths.\n\n\n(c) Sequence Traces\n\n\nIn other optional aspects, the graphical user interface comprises a graphical depiction of a sequence of interest to aid with possible protein design efforts. The sequence of interest may be the test or candidate sequence (ie., an input sequence) or it may be a sequence in which desirable covarations are integrated (ie., an output sequence). The sequence of interest may be graphically represented as a line.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the graphical interface comprises both (i) a depiction of a sequence of interest; and (ii) a grid layout (e.g., the sequence of interest is superimposed on the grid layout). In another embodiment, the graphical interface comprises both (i) a depiction of a sequence of interest; and (ii) a covariation overlay (e.g., the sequence of interest is superimposed on the covariation overlay). In yet other embodiments, the graphical interface comprises (i) a depiction of a sequence of the interest; (ii) a covariation overlay; and (iii) a grid layout (e.g., the sequence of interest is superimposed (e.g., traced) on the covariation overlay which is in turn superimposed on the grid layout).\n\n\nA sequence of interest may be displayed on a grid layout, for example, as a curve connecting adjacent amino acids that are graphically depicted within the grid layout. A sequence of interest displayed in this fashion is termed a “sequence trace”. In preferred embodiments, the sequence trace should pass or thread through only one cell (or graphical representation of an amino acid type) for a particular row or column of the grid layout that represents a particular residue position. More preferably, the sequence trace passes through the cell which graphically represents the residue type occurring at a particular residue position within the sequence of interest. The sequence trace may pass though every cell of the grid layout that represent a residue within the sequence of interest, or it may pass through only the cells that represent a portion of the sequence of interest. An exemplary sequence trace of a sequence of interest is depicted in \nFIG. 77\n. Sequence traces depicted therein (catmull-rom splines) were drawn using a bezier function. Given two nodes to draw a sequence transition bezier curve, the node pair's previous and next nodes are used as anchor points and the two nodes themselves are used as the first and second control points. For nodes in the first column (representing the first residues of amino acid sequences), the first control point doubles as its anchor point; for nodes in the last column, its second control point double as its anchor point.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, the sequence trace plot is rendered interactive for manipulation by the user. For example, the cells within the grid layout (representing can be rendered interactive for selection by the user. In one embodiment, the selected cell can be assigned a particular selection state (e.g., a positive, neutral, or negative selection state). In one exemplary embodiment, a cell representing a particular residue can be positively selected by the user so that the sequence trace can be retraced to pass though the selected cell. For example, if a cell is positively selected by the user, multiple sequence traces can be generated for all sequences of interest (e.g., all sequences within the reference set or alignment) that employ the residue represented by the positively selected cell. In an alternative embodiment, a cell representing a particular residue can be negatively selected by the user so that the sequence trace does not pass through the selected cell. Accordingly, sequence traces can be generated for every sequence of interest (e.g., all sequences within the reference set or alignment) that excludes the residue represented by the negatively selected cell.\n\n\nMultiple sequences of interest can be graphically displayed, so long as they can be distinguished by the user (e.g., using different line thicknesses or continuities). For example, to compare different sequence alignments, sequences traces representing multiple sequences of interest from two or more alignments can be overlaid on the grid layout (e.g., with different colors, preferably opposing colors) to enable visualization of differential residue usage on a global scale.\n\n\n(d) Display Modes\n\n\nThe graphical user interface may facilitate any art-recognized functionality. For example, in certain embodiments, the graphical user interface may be capable of panning or zooming on different portions of the grid layout. For example, the viewport size of the grid layout can be changed depending on the user's computer screen resolution and visualization can be zoomed out or panned for viewing an alignment that does not fit in the view port initially.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, data masking is employed, for example, to emphasize the most important covariation pairs and/or networks across several pairs. The graphical user interface of the invention may employ one or more display modes for the viewing of covariations (e.g., statistically-significant covariations). Preferably, said display modes are available in an interactive plot when viewing a sequence trace of a sequence of interest. Exemplary Viewermodes are as follows:\n\n\nViewermode #1: Only covariations between residues that are also present in the sequence of interest are displayed. These covariations can be thought of as hypothesized residue-residue interactions (e.g., those found by statistical residue pair frequency analysis) that hold the corresponding protein molecule together and may be important for function.\n\n\nViewermode #2: The only covariations displayed are those between residue pairs having only one residue of the residue pair present in the sequence of interest. These covariations are residue-residue interactions that tend to be conserved but are not present in the sequence of interest, and whose absence may be detrimental to protein stability. This viewermode is particularly preferred when the Covariation Analysis Tool is employed for protein design (see Section IV supra).\n\n\nViewermode #3: The only covariations displayed are those between residue pairs having neither amino acid member of the covarying pair present in the sequence of interest.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, all viewermodes are displayed to the user but each in a unique display format. In another embodiment, all viewermodes are separately displayed (e.g., in separate display windows).\n\n\n \nFIG. 89\n depicts an exemplary environment suitable for practicing an embodiment of the invention. A \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n supports an initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n and \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n. The \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n may be a workstation, server, laptop, mainframe, PDA or other computing device equipped with one or more processors and able to support the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n and \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n. The \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n may have a single processor or multiple processors and each of the processors may have one core or multiple cores. The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n is implemented in software and programmatically analyzes covariation between pairs of residues within alignment to obtain covariation data. The \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n is in communication with, and outputs data to, an \noutput display device\n \n8910\n. The \nOutput display device\n \n8910\n displays a graphical user interface (GUI) 8912 generated by the \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n. The \nGUI\n \n8912\n may include a grid layout \n8914\n and a \ncovariation overlay\n \n8916\n. The \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n may also be in communication over a \nnetwork\n \n8920\n with one or \n \nmore storage locations\n \n \n8930\n and \n8940\n that respectively hold \n \nsequence data\n \n \n8932\n and \n8942\n. The initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n programmatically retrieves candidate sequences from the \n \nsequence data\n \n \n8932\n and \n8942\n based on user-supplied and/or pre-determined parameters. The retrieved sequence data is analyzed by the \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that although the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n and \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n are depicted separately in \nFIG. 89\n, they may be implemented as part of an integrated application, process or plug-in. Similarly, it should be appreciated that the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n and analysis facility may each separately be a task, thread, process, application or plug-in. The \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n may communicate over the \nnetwork\n \n8920\n with the \n \nstorage locations\n \n \n8930\n and \n8940\n using a number of different mediums and configurations. For example, the \nnetwork\n \n8920\n may be arranged as a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), an intranet, the Internet, and/or may be a wireless network and/or a telephone line, or some other type of network allowing the \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n to communicate with the \n \nstorage locations\n \n \n8930\n and \n8940\n. The \n \nstorage locations\n \n \n8930\n and \n8940\n may be databases or some other type of storage datastructure hosted by computing devices that are accessible over the \nnetwork\n \n8920\n. It should be noted that although components of the present invention are depicted in a particular configuration in \nFIG. 89\n, other component configurations are also possible within the scope of the present invention. For example, the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n and \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n may be located on separate computing devices and/or the \n \nsequence data\n \n \n8932\n and \n8942\n may be located on one or more databases hosted by the \ncomputing device\n \n8900\n.\n\n\n \nFIG. 90\n is a flowchart of an exemplary sequence of steps that may be followed by an embodiment of the invention in order to determine a sequence covariation score that may be used as a measure of the stability of a polypeptide. The sequence begins with the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n providing alignment of a curated reference set of sequences corresponding to an Ig fold of a polypeptide (step \n9000\n). The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n then calculates covariation between residues of the sequence of the alignment as described herein to generate covariation data (step \n9002\n). The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n uses the covariation data to determine a sequence covariation score for a candidate sequence from covariations within the covariation data (step \n9004\n). The determined sequence covariation score provides an indicator of the measure of stability of the polypeptide and may be stored and/or output to a user via the \nGUI\n \n8912\n or in some other manner (step \n9006\n).\n\n\nAs noted above, the \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n may also be used to determine a consensus score. \nFIG. 91\n is a flowchart of an exemplary sequence of steps that may be followed by an embodiment of the invention in order to determine and use a consensus score to predict the stability of a candidate protein. The sequence begins by using the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n to provide a reference set of sequences corresponding to a test domain sequence of a candidate protein (step \n9100\n). The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n then determines residue frequencies at amino acid positions within the test domain sequence to obtain a consensus score (step \n9102\n). The determined consensus score may then be stored and/or output to a user to provide a prediction of the stability of the candidate protein (step \n9104\n).\n\n\nThe \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n may also be used to determine an average consensus score. \nFIG. 92\n is a flowchart of an exemplary sequence of steps that may be followed by an embodiment of the invention in order to determine and use an average consensus score as a measure of the stability of a candidate protein. The sequence begins by using the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n to provide a reference set of sequences corresponding to a test domain sequence of a candidate protein (step \n9200\n). The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n then determines residue frequencies at amino acid positions within the test domain sequence to obtain a consensus score (step \n9202\n). The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n also determines residue frequencies within the sequences of the reference set to determine an average consensus score (step \n9204\n). The consensus score is compared with the average consensus score in order to determine a sequence score (step \n9206\n) and the determined sequence score may then be stored and/or output to a user to provide a prediction of the stability of the candidate protein (step \n9206\n).\n\n\n \nFIG. 93\n is a flowchart of an exemplary series of steps that may be followed by an embodiment of the invention in order to identify and substitute an amino acid residue that fails to satisfy a covariation with the covarying residue found at a corresponding position in the alignment to determine an improved amino acid sequence of the polypeptide. The sequence begins by the initial \nsequence collection process\n \n8902\n providing alignment of a curated reference set of sequences corresponding to an Ig fold of a polypeptide (step \n9300\n). The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n then calculates covariation between residues of the sequence of the alignment to identify covarying residues (step \n9302\n). The \nanalysis facility\n \n8904\n may identify a particular residue of the polypeptide that fails to satisfy a covariation and may substitute a covarying residue found at a corresponding position in the alignment (step \n9304\n) in order to improve the sequence of the polypeptide. The improved sequence may then be stored or output to a user (step \n9306\n).\n\n\nThe present invention may be provided as one or more computer-readable programs embodied on or in one or more mediums. The mediums may be a floppy disk, a hard disk, a compact disc, a digital versatile disc, a flash memory card, a PROM, an MRAM, a RAM, a ROM, or a magnetic tape. In general, the computer-readable programs may be implemented in any programming language. Some examples of languages that can be used include FORTRAN, C, C++, C#, Python or Java. The software programs may be stored on or in one or more mediums as object code. Hardware acceleration may be used and all or a portion of the code may run on a FPGA, an ASIP, or an ASIC. The code may run in a virtualized environment such as in a virtual machine. Multiple virtual machines running the code may be resident on a single processor.\n\n\nVI. Methods of Evaluating Protein Stability\n\n\nThe stability properties of the compositions of the invention can be analyzed using methods known in the art. Stability parameters acceptable to those in the art may be employed. Exemplary parameters are described in more detail below. In exemplary embodiments, thermal stability is evaluated. In preferred embodiments, the expression levels (e.g., as measured by % yield) of the compositions of the invention are evaluated. In other preferred embodiments, the aggregation levels of the compositions of the invention are evaluated.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the stability properties of a composition of an invention are compared with that of a suitable control. Exemplary controls include conventional scFv molecule. A particularly preferred control is a (Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nscFv molecule.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, one or more parameters described below are measured. In one embodiment, one or more of these parameters is measured following expression in a mammalian cell. In one embodiment, one or more parameters described below are measured under large scale manufacturing conditions (e.g., expression of scFvs or molecules comprising scFvs in a bioreactor).\n\n\na) Thermal Stability\n\n\nThe thermal stability of the compositions of the invention may be analyzed using a number of non-limiting biophysical or biochemical techniques known in the art. In certain embodiments, thermal stability is evaluated by analytical spectroscopy.\n\n\nAn exemplary analytical spectroscopy method is Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). DSC employs a calorimeter which is sensitive to the heat absorbances that accompany the unfolding of most proteins or protein domains (see, e.g. Sanchez-Ruiz, et al., \nBiochemistry, \n27: 1648-52, 1988). To determine the thermal stability of a protein, a sample of the protein is inserted into the calorimeter and the temperature is raised until the Fab or scFv unfolds. The temperature at which the protein unfolds is indicative of overall protein stability.\n\n\nAnother exemplary analytical spectroscopy method is Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. CD spectrometry measures the optical activity of a composition as a function of increasing temperature. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy measures differences in the absorption of left-handed polarized light versus right-handed polarized light which arise due to structural asymmetry. A disordered or unfolded structure results in a CD spectrum very different from that of an ordered or folded structure. The CD spectrum reflects the sensitivity of the proteins to the denaturing effects of increasing temperature and is therefore indicative of a protein's thermal stability (see van Mierlo and Steemsma, \nJ. Biotechnol., \n79(3):281-98, 2000).\n\n\nAnother exemplary analytical spectroscopy method for measuring thermal stability is Fluorescence Emission Spectroscopy (see van Mierlo and Steemsma, supra). Yet another exemplary analytical spectroscopy method for measuring thermal stability is Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (see, e.g. van Mierlo and Steemsma, supra).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the thermal stability of a composition of the invention is measured biochemically. An exemplary biochemical method for assessing thermal stability is a thermal challenge assay. In a “thermal challenge assay”, a composition of the invention is subjected to a range of elevated temperatures for a set period of time. For example, in one embodiment, test scFv molecules or molecules comprising scFv molecules are subject to an range of increasing temperatures, e.g., for 1-1.5 hours. The activity of the protein is then assayed by a relevant biochemical assay. For example, if the protein is a binding protein (e.g. an scFv or scFv-containing polypeptide of the invention) the binding activity of the binding protein may be determined by a functional or quantitative ELISA.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, such an assay may be done in a high-throughput format. In another embodiment, a library of scFv variants may be created using methods known in the art. scFv expression may be induced an scFvs may be subjected to thermal challenge. The challenged test samples may be assayed for binding and those scFvs which are stable may be scaled up and further characterized.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, thermal stability is evaluated by measuring the melting temperature (Tm) of a composition of the invention using any of the above techniques (e.g. analytical spectroscopy techniques). The melting temperature is the temperature at at the midpoint of a thermal transition curve wherein 50% of molecules of a composition are in a folded state.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, thermal stability is evaluated by measuring the specific heat or heat capacity (Cp) of a composition of the invention using an analytical calorimetric technique (e.g. DSC). The specific heat of a composition is the energy (e.g. in kcal/mol) required to raise by 1° C., the temperature of 1 mol of water. As large Cp is a hallmark of a denatured or inactive protein composition. In certain embodiments, the change in heat capacity (ΔCp) of a composition is measured by determining the specific heat of a composition before and after its thermal transition. In other embodiments, thermal stability may be evaluated by measuring or determining other parameters of thermodynamic stability including Gibbs free energy of unfolding (ΔG), enthalpy of unfolding (ΔH), or entropy of unfolding (ΔS).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, one or more of the above biochemical assays (e.g. a thermal challenge assay) is used to determine the temperature (ie. the T\nC \nvalue) at which 50% of the composition retains its activity (e.g. binding activity).\n\n\nb) % Aggregation\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the stability of a composition of the invention is determined by measuring its propensity to aggregate. Aggregation can be measured by a number of non-limiting biochemical or biophysical techniques. For example, the aggregation of a composition of the invention may be evaluated using chromatography, e.g. Size-Exclusion Chromatograpy (SEC). SEC separates molecules on the basis of size. A column is filled with semi-solid beads of a polymeric gel that will admit ions and small molecules into their interior but not large ones. When a protein composition is applied to the top of the column, the compact folded proteins (ie. non-aggregated proteins) are distributed through a larger volume of solvent than is available to the large protein aggregates. Consequently, the large aggregates move more rapidly through the column, and in this way the mixture can be separated or fractionated into its components. Each fraction can be separately quantified (e.g. by light scattering) as it elutes from the gel. Accordingly, the % aggregation of a composition of the invention can be determined by comparing the concentration of a fraction with the total concentration of protein applied to the gel. Stable compositions elute from the column as essentially a single fraction and appear as essentially a single peak in the elution profile or chromatogram.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, SEC is used in conjunction with in-line light scattering (e.g. classical or dynamic light scattering) to determine the % aggregation of a composition. In certain preferred embodiments, static light scattering is employed to measure the mass of each fraction or peak, independent of the molecular shape or elution position. In other preferred embodiments, dynamic light scattering is employed to measure the hydrodynamic size of a composition. Other exemplary methods for evaluating protein stability include High-Speed SEC (see e.g. Corbett et al., \nBiochemistry. \n23(8):1888-94, 1984).\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the % aggregation is determined by measuring the fraction of protein aggregates within the protein sample. In a preferred embodiment, the % aggregation of a composition is measured by determining the fraction of folded protein within the protein sample.\n\n\nc) % Yield\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the stability of a composition of the invention is evaluated by measuring the amount of protein that is recovered (herein the “% yield”) following expression (e.g. recombinant expression) of the protein. For example, the % yield can be measured by determining milligrams of protein recovered for every ml of host culture media (ie. mg/ml of protein). In a preferred embodiment the % yield is evaluated following expression in a mammalian host cell (e.g. a CHO cell).\n\n\nd) % Loss\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the stability of a composition of the invention is evaluated by monitoring the loss of protein at a range of temperatures (e.g. from −80 to 25° C.) following storage for a defined time period. The amount or concentration of recovered protein can be determined using any protein quantification method known in the art, and compared with the initial concentration of protein. Exemplary protein quantification methods include SDS-PAGE analysis or the Bradford assay for (Bradford, et al., \nAnal. Biochem. \n72, 248, (1976)). A preferred method for evaluating % loss employs any of the analytical SEC methods described supra. It will be appreciated that % Loss measurements can be determined under any desired storage condition or storage formulation, including, for example, lyophilized protein preparations.\n\n\ne) % Proteolysis\n\n\nIn still other embodiments, the stability of a composition of the invention is evaluated by determining the amount of protein that is proteolyzed following storage under standard conditions. In an exemplary embodiment, proteolysis is determined by SDS-PAGE a sample of the protein wherein the amount of intact protein is compared with the amount of low-molecular weight fragments which appear on the SDS-PAGE gel. In another exemplary embodiment, proteolysis is determined by Mass Spectrometry (MS), wherein the amount of protein of the expected molecular weight is compared with the amount of low-molecular weight protein fragments within the sample.\n\n\nf) Binding Affinity\n\n\nIn still other embodiments, the stability of a composition of the invention may be assessed by determining its target binding affinity. A wide variety of methods for determining binding affinity are known in the art. An exemplary method for determining binding affinity employs surface plasmon resonance. Surface plasmon resonance is an optical phenomenon that allows for the analysis of real-time biospecific interactions by detection of alterations in protein concentrations within a biosensor matrix, for example using the BIAcore system (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden and Piscataway, N.J.). For further descriptions, see Jönsson, U., et al. (1993) \nAnn. Biol. Clin. \n51:19-26; Jönsson, U., et al. (1991) \nBiotechniques \n11:620-627; Johnsson, B., et al. (1995) \nJ. Mol. Recognit. \n8:125-131; and Johnnson, B., et al. (1991) \nAnal. Biochem. \n198:268-277.\n\n\ng) Other Binding Studies\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments, the stability of a composition of the invention may be assessed by quantifying the binding of a labeled compound to denatured or unfolded portions of a binding molecule. Such molecules are preferably hydrophobic, as they preferably bind or interact with large hydrophobic patches of amino acids that are normally buried in the interior of the native protein, but which are exposed in a denatured or unfolded binding molecule. An exemplary labeled compound is the hydrophobic fluorescent dye, 1-anilino-8-naphthaline sulfonate (ANS).\n\n\nVII. Methods for Selecting Stable Proteins\n\n\nThe methods described supra for the prediction of protein stability can be employed to select a candidate protein (e.g. antibodies) for further use. In certain embodiments, the methods of the invention are employed to select a protein for expression. In other embodiments, the methods of the invention are used to select a candidate protein for modification. In exemplary embodiments, the prediction methods of the invention can be employed in the humanization of a non-human donor antibody (e.g. to select an acceptor immunoglobulin).\n\n\nA candidate protein may be selected based on its total consensus score or sequence score as determined using the methods of the invention. In certain embodiments, the candidate protein is selected if its consensus score is greater than a suitable negative control (e.g. greater than 5%, preferably greater than 10%, more preferably greater than 20%). In other embodiments, the candidate protein is selected if its consensus score is substantially similar to (e.g. within 20%, 10%, or 5%) or greater than (e.g. greater than 5%, preferably greater than 10%, more preferably greater than 20%) a suitable positive control.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, a candidate protein is selected if its consensus score is substantially similar to its ideal or perfect consensus score (e.g. within 30%, preferably within 20%, more preferably within 10%).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, a candidate protein is selected if its sequence score is greater than zero. In one embodiment, the candidate protein is selected if its sequence score is greater than 0.5. In another embodiment, the candidate protein is selected if its sequence score is greater than 1. In other embodiment, the candidate protein is selected if its sequence score is greater than 2. In a preferred embodiment, the candidate protein is selected if its sequence score is greater than 3.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, a candidate protein is selected if its Δ score is at least −3, at least −2, or at least −1, preferably at least 0, more preferably at least 1.\n\n\na. Selecting an Acceptor Immunoglobulin for Antibody Humanization\n\n\nHumanized antibodies can be produced using recombinant DNA technology, see for example, e.g., Queen et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA\n, (1989), 86:10029-10033; Jones et al., \nNature\n, (1986), 321:522-25; Riechmann et al., \nNature\n, (1988), 332:323-27; Verhoeyen et al., \nScience\n, (1988), 239:1534-36; Orlandi et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA\n, (1989), 86:3833-37; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,225,539; 5,530,101; 5,585,089; 5,693,761; 5,693,762; 6,180,370. When a preferred nonhuman donor antibody has been selected for humanization, an appropriate human acceptor antibody may be obtained, e.g., from sequence databases of expressed human antibody genes, from germline Ig sequences or a consensus sequence of several human antibodies. The substitution of nonhuman CDRs into a human variable domain framework is most likely to result in retention of their correct spatial orientation if the human variable domain framework adopts the same or similar conformation to the nonhuman variable framework from which the CDRs originated. This is achieved by obtaining the human variable domains from human acceptor antibodies whose framework sequences exhibit a high degree of sequence identity with the nonhuman variable framework domains from which the CDRs were derived. The heavy and light chain variable framework regions can be derived from the same or different human antibody sequences. Preferably the human acceptor antibody retains the canonical and interface residues of the donor antibody. Additionally, the human acceptor antibody preferably has substantial similarity in the length of CDR loops. See Kettleborough et al., \nProtein Engineering \n4:758 (1991); Kolbinger et al., \nProtein Engineering \n6:971 (1993) and Carter et al., WO 92/22653.\n\n\nHaving identified the CDRs of the donor antibody and appropriate human acceptor antibody, the next step is to determine which, if any, residues from these components should be substituted to optimize the properties of the resulting humanized antibody. Typically, some or all of the amino acids of the nonhuman, donor immunoglobulin light or heavy chain that are required for antigen binding (e.g., one or more CDRs) are used to substitute for the corresponding amino acids from the light or heavy chain of the human acceptor antibody. The human acceptor antibody retains some or all of the amino acids that are not required for antigen binding. When necessary, one or more residues in the human framework regions can be changed to residues at the corresponding positions in the murine antibody so as to preserve the binding affinity of the humanized antibody to the antigen. This change is sometimes called “back mutation.” Certain amino acids from the human variable region framework residues are selected for back mutation based on their possible influence on CDR conformation and/or binding to antigen.\n\n\nIn some cases, however, the humanization process results in unnatural changes to the variable domain which confers undesirable instability to the humanized antibody. For example, the acceptor immunoglobulin may have rare sequence variations that confer low stability. This is particularly true of certain germline sequences which may not be used with great frequency by the immune system.\n\n\nThe methods of the invention provide improved methods for humanization. In particular, the methods of the invention allow the skilled artisan to predict which test sequence (e.g. test germline sequence) with a reference set of candidate acceptor sequences (e.g. germline sequences) are suitably stable for use in the humanization of the acceptor sequence. Test acceptor sequences (e.g. germline sequences) which have a score that is predictive of acceptable stability (e.g. have a high consensus score as compared to the average consensus score of the reference set) may be selected as an acceptor immunoglobulin.\n\n\nVIII. Library Based Methods for Identifying Stabilized scFv Molecules\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides methods of identifying scFv molecules with improved protein stability, e.g. improved thermal stability. The methods of the invention comprise (i) providing a library comprising candidate scFv molecules; and (ii) screening the library to identify candidate scFv molecules with improved protein stability relative to a suitable control (e.g. a control scFv molecule). As used herein, a “candidate scFv molecule” is an scFv molecule formed by introducing one or more candidate stabilizing mutations into the scFv molecule, wherein the effect of the candidate stabilizing mutation on the stability of the scFv molecule is not known a priori, i.e., an scFv molecule into which a mutation has been introduced and which has to be evaluated to determine whether the mutation results in an scFv molecule with increased stability. In one embodiment, a candidate scFv molecule is one formed by introducing one or more candidate stabilizing mutations into a conventional (ie. non-stabilized) scFv molecule. In another embodiment, a candidate scFv molecule is one formed by introducing one or more candidate stabilizing mutations into one of the stabilized scFv molecules described in Section II, supra.\n\n\nBy a “library of candidate scFv molecules” herein is meant at least two non-redundant candidate scFv molecules, with at least about 10 being preferred, at least about 100 being particularly preferred, and at least about 1000 being especially preferred (e.g. at least about 10\n4\n, 10\n5\n, 10\n6\n, 10\n7\n, or 10\n8 \nscFv molecules). In one embodiment, the library is randomized, with unspecified mutations generated randomly at any position. In another embodiment, the scFv library is a partially randomized or designed. That is, a specified amino acid residue or class of amino acid residues is introduced randomly at any position of the scFv, or a specified amino acid position is selected for mutagenesis with an unspecified amino acid, a particular class of amino acids, or a specified amino amino acid. In a preferred embodiment, an scFv library is designed by substituting a selected residue of an scFv molecule with an amino acid of a defined class, for example, a hydrophobic amino acid, a basic amino acid, a hydrophilic amino acid, a charged amino acid, a sterically biased (either small or large) amino acid, or a cysteine capable of disulfide bond formation.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the scFv library comprises candidate scFv molecules with candidate stabilizing mutation(s) that are introduced within a variable region (VL and/or VH) of the scFv molecule. In other embodiments, the scFv library comprises candidate scFv molecules with candidate stabilizing mutation(s) that are introduced within an scFv linker of the scFv molecule. In other embodiments, the scFv library comprises candidate scFv molecules with candidate stabilizing mutation(s) that are introduced within an scFv linker of the scFv molecule and candidate stabilizing mutation(s) that are introduced within a variable region (VL and/or VH).\n\n\na. Design of scFv Libraries\n\n\nMethods for designing the scFv library may be aided by molecular or computational modeling. In certain embodiments, library design may be carried out in silico. In certain embodiments, the scFv library may be designed by the following two-step method:\n\n \n \n \n \n1) identifying target amino acid residues in the scFv that when altered by a mutation (e.g, by amino acid substitution), are predicted to result in improved scFv stability (herein “candidate destabilizing residues”); and\n \n2) substituting the target amino acid residues with candidate stabilizing amino acid residues.\n\n\nStep #1: Identifying Candidate Destabilizing Residues\n\n \n \n \n\n\nIn certain embodiments, candidate destabilizing amino acid residues may be identified by sequence-based analysis. For example, candidate destabilizing amino acid residues may be identified by comparing a variable region sequence of an scFv with a reference set of variable region sequences, e.g. variable region sequences from naturally-occurring human antibodies, and selecting those variable region amino acid residues of the scFv which are unusual or rare at their corresponding amino acid positions within the reference set. In preferred embodiments, only the framework regions of a variable region sequence of the scFv are analysed, while the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the variable region are conserved in order to avoid disrupting the binding activity of the scFv molecule.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one which is absent or found at a low frequency at a corresponding position within a reference set of homologous variable region sequences. Methods for compiling reference sets are described in Sections III-V, supra. In preferred embodiments, the candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one which is present within less than 10% of the sequences at corresponding positions within the reference set. In more preferred embodiments, the candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one which is present within less than 5% of the sequences at corresponding positions within the reference set. In particularly preferred embodiments, the candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one which is present within less than 2% (e.g. 0.5%, 0.75%, or 1%) of the sequences at corresponding positions within the reference set.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one which differs from the amino acid present at the corresponding position in a consensus sequence of the reference set of variable region sequences (ie. the consensus amino acid residue). Methods for determining the consensus sequence of the reference set are described in Section III and V, supra.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one which has a low consensus score. Methods for determining a consensus score of an amino acid are described in Section III and V, supra. In one embodiment, the candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one with a consensus score of less than 0.5 (e.g. less than 0.4, less than 0.3, less than 0.2, or less than 0.1). In a preferred embodiment, the candidate destabilizing amino acid residue is one with a consensus score of less than 0.3.\n\n\nStep #2: Selection of Candidate Stabilizing Mutations\n\n\nHaving identified one or more candidate destabilizing amino acids, the next step is to select one or more candidate stabilizing mutations for each destabilizing amino acid. The scFv library may then be designed to include a representative candidate scFv molecule for each candidate stabilizing mutation that is selected.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, every natural amino acid variant of a particular destabilizing amino acid is selected as a candidate stabilizing mutation (ie. 19 candidate stabilizing mutations for every destabilizing amino acid).\n\n\nIn more preferred embodiments, a subset of the natural amino acid variants of a particular destabilizing amino acid are selected as candidate stabilizing mutations (ie. 1-18 candidate stabilizing amino acids for every destabilizing amino acid). In one embodiment, the subset of candidate stabilizing mutations comprise substitutions with an amino acid of a defined class, for example, hydrophobic amino acids, basic amino acids, hydrophilic amino acids, charged amino acids, or sterically biased amino acids (either small or large) amino acids.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a subset of candidate stabilizing mutations include substitutions with amino acids which are present at high frequencies at a position corresponding to that of the destabilizing amino acid within a reference set of homologous variable region sequences. In preferred embodiments, a candidate stabilizing mutation comprises substitution with an amino acid that is present within the database at a frequency of greater than 10%. In more preferred embodiments, the amino acid is present at a frequency greater than 15%. In still more preferred embodiments, the amino acid is present at a frequency of greater than 20%. In yet more preferred embodiments, the amino acid is present at a frequency of greater than 25%.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a candidate stabilizing mutation is a substitution with the consensus amino acid (ie. most frequent residue) found at the position of the destabilizing amino acid within the reference set.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a subset of candidate stabilizing mutations comprise substitutions with every amino acid that is found within a reference set of homologous variable region sequences at the position of the destabilizing amino acid. Accordingly, an scFv library may then be designed to include a representative candidate scFv molecule for each candidate stabilizing mutation that is represented in the reference set.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the subset of candidate stabilizing mutations may be identified or prioritized for screening by an analysis (e.g. visual inspection or computational analysis) of a three-dimensional structure or model of a variable region of the scFv molecule. The three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide influences its biological activity and stability, and that structure can be determined or predicted in a number of ways. Tertiary structure can be predicted using model building of three-dimensional structures of one or more homologous proteins (or protein complexes) that have a known three-dimensional structure. X-ray crystallography is perhaps the best-known way of determining protein structure (accordingly, the term “crystal structure” may be used in place of the term “structure”), but estimates can also be made using circular dichroism, light scattering, or by measuring the absorption and emission of radiant energy. Other useful techniques include neutron diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and homology modeling. All of these methods are known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and they have been well described in standard textbooks (see, e.g., \nPhysical Chemistry, \n4th Ed., W. J. Moore, Prentiss-Hall, N.J., 1972, or \nPhysical Biochemistry\n, K. E. Van Holde, Prentiss-Hall, N.J., 1971)) and numerous publications. Any of these techniques can be carried out to determine the structure of a molecule comprising a variable region of an scFv molecule (e.g. an antibody, a Fab, or an scFv molecule itself).\n\n\nThe structure of the variable region may be modeled in silico. For example, the compatibility of a candidate stabilizing mutation with the three-dimensional structure may be analyzed by computationally modeling the substitution of a destabilizing mutation with a candidate stabilizing mutation. The candidate stabilizing mutation may be selected for inclusion in the scFv library if it is compatable with the overall structure of the scFv molecule. In one embodiment, the candidate stabilizing mutation may be selected if it does not perturb the native folding or conformation of the variable region of the scFv molecule or one or more complementarity determining regions (CDRs) thereof. In another embodiment, the candidate stabilizing mutation may be selected if it does not perturb the ability of the variable region to form a native VL/VH interface.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a candidate stabilizing mutation may be selected by applying a sidechain repacking technique to a structure (e.g. the crystal structure or model) of the variable region. In a sidechain repacking calculation, the candidate stabilizing residues can be modified computationally, and the stability of the resulting mutants is evaluated computationally. The sidechain repacking calculation generates a ranked list of the mutants that have altered stability (i.e., altered intramolecular energy). The number of protein mutants that is evaluated computationally can be very large, since every variable amino acid position can be mutated into all 20 standard amino acids. Exemplary computational algorithms used to rank the results of the computational analysis include dead-end elimination and tree search algorithms (see for example, Lasters et al. (\nProtein Eng. \n8:815-822, 1995), Looger and Hellinga (\nJ. Mol. Biol. \n307:429-445, 2001), and Dahiyat and Mayo (\nProtein Sci. \n5:895-903, 1996)). Accordingly, an scFv library may then be designed to include a representative candidate scFv molecule for each of the top-ranked candidate stabilizing mutations in the ranked list of mutations generated by the sidechain repacking calculation. In certain embodiments, at least the top ranked mutation is selected (e.g., the top ranked, the top two ranked, the top three ranked, the top four ranked, or the top five ranked mutations are selected).\n\n\nb. Construction of scFv Libraries\n\n\nHaving determined the candidate stabilizing mutations to include in the scFv library, one can use any of a variety of available methods to produce candidate scFv molecules comprising the mutations. Such polypeptides can, for example, be produced by recombinant methods. Moreover, because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, a variety of nucleic acid sequences can be used to encode each desired scFv.\n\n\nExemplary art recognized methods for making a nucleic acid molecule encoding a candidate scFv molecule include, but are not limited to, preparation by site-directed (or oligonucleotide-mediated) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared DNA encoding the candidate scFv.\n\n\nSite-directed mutagenesis is a preferred method for preparing substitution variants. This technique is well known in the art (see, e.g., Carter et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 13:4431-4443 (1985) and Kunkel et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:488 (1987)). Briefly, in carrying out site-directed mutagenesis of DNA, the parent DNA is altered by first hybridizing an oligonucleotide encoding the desired mutation to a single strand of such parent DNA. After hybridization, a DNA polymerase is used to synthesize an entire second strand, using the hybridized oligonucleotide as a primer, and using the single strand of the parent DNA as a template. Thus, the oligonucleotide encoding the desired mutation is incorporated in the resulting double-stranded DNA, which may then be ligated into a plasmid or other suitable vector.\n\n\nPCR mutagenesis is also suitable for making candidate scFv molecules. See Higuchi, in PCR Protocols, pp. 177-183 (Academic Press, 1990); and Vallette et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 17:723-583 (1989). Briefly, when small amounts of template DNA are used as starting material in a PCR, primers that differ slightly in sequence from the corresponding region in a template DNA can be used to generate relatively large quantities of a specific DNA fragment that differs from the template sequence only at the positions where the primers differ from the template. The PCR primers may also be designed to incorporate restriction sites, such that the DNA product of the PCR reaction can be can then be directly ligated into a plasmid or other suitable vector.\n\n\nAnother method for preparing variants, cassette mutagenesis, is based on the technique described by Wells et al., Gene 34:315-323 (1985). The starting material is the plasmid (or other vector) comprising the starting polypeptide DNA to be mutated. The codon(s) in the parent DNA to be mutated are identified. There must be a unique restriction endonuclease site on each side of the identified mutation site(s). If no such restriction sites exist, they may be generated using the above-described oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis method to introduce them at appropriate locations in the starting polypeptide DNA. The plasmid DNA is cut at these sites to linearize it. A double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the sequence of the DNA between the restriction sites but containing the desired mutation(s) is synthesized using standard procedures, wherein the two strands of the oligonucleotide are synthesized separately and then hybridized together using standard techniques. This double-stranded oligonucleotide is referred to as the cassette. This cassette is designed to have 5′ and 3′ ends that are compatible with the ends of the linearized plasmid, such that it can be directly ligated to the plasmid.\n\n\nRepresentative nucleic acids for each of the candidate scFv molecules may be generated by the above methods. The nucleic acids may then be cloned into expression vectors to form an expression vector library. Host cells may then be transformed with the resulting library of vectors, and the host cells cultured under the appropriate conditions in order to express each candidate scFv molecule.\n\n\nc. Screening Methods\n\n\nA scFv library the invention may be screened in an assay (e.g. a high-throughput assay) to identify candidate scFv molecules with desired protein stability. Such an assay may employ any of the methods for evaluating protein stability described in Section VI, supra. A particularly preferred method is a thermal challenge assay.\n\n\nSuch assay methods generally involve comparing the thermal stability of a candidate scFv molecule with that of a suitable control and selecting the candidate scFv molecule if the thermal stability is greater than that of the control. Exemplary suitable controls include conventional scFv molecules, e.g. a (Gly4Ser)3 scFv molecule. Candidate scFv molecules are may be selected if they have a thermal stability that is greater than about 0.1, about 0.25, about 0.5, about 0.75, about 1, about 1.25, about 1.5, about 1.75, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, about 6, about 7, about 8, about 9, or about 10 degrees Celsius than that of the control. In an exemplary embodiment, a candidate scFv molecule is selected if it has a thermal stability than is greater than about 3 degrees Celsius than that of the control.\n\n\nscFv Libraries may be presented in different assay formats. For example, scFv molecules may be presented in solution (e.g., Houghten (1992) \nBiotechniques \n13:412-421), on beads (Lam (1991) \nNature \n354:82-84), chips (Fodor (1993) \nNature \n364:555-556), bacteria (Ladner U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409), spores (Ladner U.S. Pat. No. '409), or on phage (Scott and Smith (1990) Science 249:386-390); (Devlin (1990) Science 249:404-406); (Cwirla et al. (1990) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. \n87:6378-6382); (Felici (1991) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222:301-310); (Ladner supra).\n\n\nIn certain exemplary embodiments, the candidate scFv molecules are assayed in a solution format. In one embodiment, each sample comprises an aliquot of a solution having candidate scFv molecules with the same candidate stabilizing mutation or mutations. Such a solution can generated by isolating individual host cell colonies from a library of host cells transformed with expression plasmid library and culturing the host cell colony in an appropriate vessel under conditions which facilitate expression of the scFv molecule. In one embodiment, the candidate scFv molecule may be purified from the host cell and resolubilized in an appropriate assay solution. In a more preferred embodiment, the candidate scFv molecule is fused to a cleavable signal peptide sequence such that the scFv molecule is secreted by the host cell into the host cell culture medium. In yet other preferred embodiments, the host cell may be cultured under conditions such that candidate scFv molecule is released into the media, along with host cell proteins.\n\n\nIt may be desirable to automate any of the above assay formats. For example, robotics may be employed to isolate each member of the scFv library (e.g. as individual host cell colonies) in rapid succession so they can be assayed in separate vessels. Examples of assay vessels include microtiter plates (e.g. 96-well microtiter plates), test tubes, and micro-centrifuge tubes.\n\n\nd. Further Optimization of Stabilized scFv Molecules\n\n\nA stable scFv molecule identified by the above screening methods can be re-modeled and further optimized to further improve its protein stability. Thus, the steps described above can be repeated with a stable scFv molecule identified in an initial round of optimization. Alternatively, the stabilizing mutations from two or more stabilized scFv molecules may be combined in a single scFv molecule to further improve protein stability.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the stable scFv molecule identified by the methods of the invention can be further optimized. For example, on or more of the following additional alterations may be made. In one embodiment, a stabilized scFv molecule may be further stabilized by introducing a disulfide bond which links an amino acid in the VL domain with an amino acid in the VH domain. Exemplary disulfide bonds include any the disulfide bonds described in Section II supra. A particularly preferred disulfide bond is VH44-VL100.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the stable scFv molecule identified by the methods of the invention is further optimized by introducing an scFv linker with an optimized length or composition. Exemplary scFv linkers are described in Section II supra. A particularly preferred scFv linker is (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4\n.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the stable scFv molecule identified by the methods of the invention is further optimized by introducing a stabilizing mutation into at least one of the V\nH \nor V\nL \ndomain.\n\n\nIX. Methods for Stabilizing Binding Molecules\n\n\nIn other aspects, the invention provides methods for improving the stability properties of binding molecules. These methods generally involve incorporating or appending a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention to the binding molecule. Surprisingly, as shown in the working examples herein, scFv molecules of the invention are not only stable on their own, they also confer improved stability to binding molecules into which they are incorporated. Accordingly, the methods of the invention provide a convenient and reliable means for improving the stability of commercially valuable binding molecules for which large scale manufacturing is often limited by poor protein stability (e.g. multispecific antibodies (e.g. bispecific antibodies) and other modified antibodies).\n\n\nStabilized scFv molecules may be incorporated into binding molecules using protein conjugation methodology that is known in the art. In one embodiment, the stabilized scFv is fused directly to an N- or C-terminus of a polypeptide, e.g., an antibody molecule. In another embodiment, a non-peptide linker is employed to link the stabilized scFv to an N- or C-terminus of a polypeptide. In yet other embodiments, a connecting peptide is used to link the stabilized scFv to a polypeptide. In an exemplary embodiment, the connecting peptide is a short gly/ser rich peptide. Exemplary Gly/Ser rich peptides are listed in Table 1 below. Other exemplary connecting peptides are known in the art (see, e.g., International PCT Application Nos. WO 2005/000898 and WO 2005/000899). In one embodiment, a stabilized scFv of the invention is linked to the C-terminal end of a binding molecule, e.g., an antibody molecule, using a S(G\n4\nS)\n3 \nlinker. In another embodiment, a stabilized scFv of the invention is linked to the N-terminal end of a binding molecule, e.g., an antibody molecule, using a (G\n4\nS)\n5 \nlinker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnecting Peptides\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nID\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinker\n\n\nNO\n\n\nDNA or Amino Acid Sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Gly\n4\nSer)\n5\n \n\n\n132\n\n\n5′-\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGGCGGTGGAGGGTCCGGTGGAGGGGGCTCTGGA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGGGGGCGGTTCAGGGGGCGGTGGATCGGGGGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAGGTGGCTCC-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n133\n\n\nGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSer(Gly\n4\nSer)\n3\n \n\n\n42\n\n\n5′-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTCCGGCGGGGGTGGATCCGGTGGAGGGGGCTCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGGCGGTGGCGGGTCC-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n43\n\n\nSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one embodiment, at least one stabilized scFv molecule is appended to an antibody molecule to make a bispecific molecule. In another embodiment, two stabilized scFv molecules are appended to an antibody molecule to make a bispecific molecule.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, stabilized binding molecules of the invention result in increased yield as compared to conventional scFv molecules or binding molecules comprising conventional scFv molecules. Methods for evaluating yield are described in Section VI, supra. In one embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule produced by the methods of the invention has an increase in yield of at least 1% relative to the unstabilized binding molecule. In other embodiments, the stabilized binding molecule has an increase in yield of at least 2%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 50%, at least 75%, or at least 100%, relative to the unstabilized binding molecule.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, binding molecules of the invention result in reduced aggregation as compared to conventional scFv molecules or binding molecules comprising conventional scFv molecules. Methods for evaluating aggregation are described in Section VI, supra. In one embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule produced by the methods of the invention has a decrease in aggregation of at least 1% relative to the unstabilized binding molecule. In other embodiments, the stabilized binding molecule has a decrease in aggregation of at least 2%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 50%, at least 75%, or at least 100%, relative to the unstabilized binding molecule.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, binding molecules of the invention result in increased long-term stability or shelf-life as compared to conventional scFv molecules or binding molecules comprising conventional scFv molecules. Methods for evaluating shelf-life include % loss or % proteolysis as described in Section VI, supra. In one embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule produced by the methods of the invention has an increase in shelf life of at least 1 day relative to the unstabilized binding molecule. This means that a preparation of binding molecules has substantially the same amount of stable binding molecules as present on the previous day. In other embodiments, the stabilized binding molecule has an increase in shelf life of at least 2 days, at least 5 days, at least 1 week, at least 2 weeks, at least 1 month, at least 2 months, at least 6 months, or at least 1 year, relative to the unstabilized binding molecule.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, binding molecules of the invention result improved stability e.g., when expressed in a particular host cell type, as compared to conventional scFv molecules or binding molecules comprising conventional scFv molecules. In exemplary embodiments, the methods of the invention result in the production of binding molecules which have increased stability (e.g. increased yield) when the binding molecule is expressed in a host cell, e.g., a bacterial or eukaryotic (e.g., yeast or mammalian) host cell. Exemplary mammalian host cells include Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, HELA (human cervical carcinoma) cells, CVI (monkey kidney line) cells, COS (a derivative of CVI with SV40 T antigen) cells, R1610 (Chinese hamster fibroblast) cells, BALBC/3T3 (mouse fibroblast) cells, HAK (hamster kidney line) cells, SP2/O (mouse myeloma) cells, BFA-1c1BPT cells (bovine endothelial cells), RAJI (human lymphocyte) cells and 293 cells (human kidney). In a preferred embodiment, two stabilized scFv molecules are appended to an antibody molecule to create a stabilized bispecific molecule for secretion in CHO cells.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, host cells capable of expressing stabilized binding molecules can be screened to select for single cell isolates that are capable of expressing high levels of solubilized and properly-folded stabilized binding molecules (e.g. binding molecules exhibiting less than 10% aggregation). Such methods may employ fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) techniques (see, for example, Brezinky et al., J Immunol Meth (2003). 277:141-155). In one embodiment, the single cell isolate is adapted to serum-free conditions to establish a stable producer cell line. The stable producer cell line may then be cultured to facilitate large-scale manufacture of a stabilized binding molecule of the invention.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the methods of the invention are employed to improve the stability of a binding molecule that is expressed from a host cell in a large volume of culture media. In exemplary embodiments, the methods of the invention result in an increased stability (e.g. increased yield) when the binding molecule is expressed in at least 1 liter of culture media. In other embodiments, the methods of the invention are used to produce a stabilized binding molecule which has an increased stability (e.g. yield) when expressed from a host cell in at least 2 liters, at least 10 liters, at least 20 liters, at least 50 liters, at least 75 liters, at least 100 liters, at least 200 liters, or at least 500 liters of culture media. In an exemplary embodiment, the methods of the invention are used to produce at least 10 mg of a stabilized binding molecule for every liter of culture media.\n\n\nX. Stabilized Binding Molecules Comprising Stabilized scFv Molecules\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention is a fusion protein. For example, a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention may be linked to a second scFv molecule or a non-scFv molecule. In one embodiment, a non-scFv molecule to which a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention may be linked provides at least one additional binding site. For example, exemplary binding sites that can be included in a binding molecule of the invention include: the receptor binding portion of a ligand, the ligand binding portion of a receptor, the substrate binding portion of an enzyme, the enzyme binding portion of a substrate, or one or more antigen binding portions of an antibody. scFv molecules may be linked, e.g., to antibody molecules to form modified antibody molecules or to other polypeptides to form fusion proteins. Some examples are described below.\n\n\nA. Modified Antibody Molecules\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention is linked to an antibody or fragment thereof to form a stabilized binding protein which is a modified antibody. In another embodiment, a stabilized scFv of the invention is linked to a modified antibody, i.e., non-naturally occurring antibody molecule, to form a stabilized binding protein. Preferred modified antibody constructs are described in more detail below. As used herein, the term “modified antibody” includes synthetic forms of antibodies which are altered such that they are not naturally occurring, e.g., antibodies that comprise at least two heavy chain portions but not two complete heavy chains (such as, domain deleted antibodies or minibodies); multi specific forms of antibodies (e.g., bispecific, trispecific, etc.) altered to bind to two or more different antigens or to different epitopes on a single antigen). In addition, the term “modified antibody” includes multivalent forms of antibodies (e.g., trivalent, tetravalent, etc., antibodies that bind to three or more copies of the same antigen).\n\n\nIt will be understood that when discussing the binding molecules of the invention, the exemplary binding specificities described herein may be imparted by a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention, a binding molecule comprising an scFv molecule of the invention or both.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the stabilized binding proteins of the present invention may be immunoreactive with one or more tumor antigens or antigens associated with immune disorders. For example, for neoplastic disorders, the binding site (i.e. the variable region or immunoreactive fragment or recombinant thereof) of the disclosed binding molecules binds to a selected tumor associated antigen at the site of the malignancy. Similarly, in one embodiment, a binding molecule may bind to at least one selected marker present on immune cells. Given the number of reported antigens associated with neoplasias and immune disorders, and the number of related antibodies, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the presently disclosed binding molecules may therefore be derived from any one of a number of whole antibodies. More generally, polypeptides useful in the present invention may be obtained or derived from any antibody (including those previously reported in the literature) that reacts with a molecule or marker associated with the selected condition. Further, the parent or precursor antibody, or fragment thereof, used to generate the stabilized binding molecules of the invention may be murine, human, chimeric, humanized, non-human primate or primatized.\n\n\nAs used herein, “tumor associated antigens” includes antigens which are generally associated with tumor cells, e.g., expressed on tumor cells. More generally, tumor associated antigens comprise antigens that provide for the localization of immunoreactive antibodies at a neoplastic cell irrespective of its expression on non-malignant cells. Such antigens may be relatively tumor specific, e.g., limited in expression to the surface of malignant cells. Alternatively, such antigens may be found on both malignant and non-malignant cells. For example, CD20 is a pan B antigen that is found on the surface of both malignant and non-malignant B cells that has proved to be an extremely effective target for immunotherapeutic antibodies for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this respect, pan T cell antigens such as CD2, CD3, CD5, CD6 and CD7 also comprise tumor associated antigens within the meaning of the present invention. Still other exemplary tumor associated antigens comprise but not limited to MAGE-1, MAGE-3, MUC-1, \nHPV\n 16, HPV E6 & E7, TAG-72, CEA, L6-Antigen, CD19, CD22, CD37, CD52, HLA-DR, EGF Receptor and HER2Receptor. In many cases immunoreactive antibodies for each of these antigens have been reported in the literature. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that each of these antibodies may serve as a precursor for antibodies of the invention in accordance with the present invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the stabilized binding molecules of the present invention preferably associate with, and bind to, tumor or immune associated antigens as described above. Accordingly, as will be discussed in some detail below the stabilized binding molecules of the present invention may be derived, generated or fabricated from any one of a number of antibodies that react with tumor associated antigens. In certain embodiments the stabilized binding molecules of the invention are domain deleted antibodies that are derived using common genetic engineering techniques whereby at least a portion of one or more constant region domains are deleted or altered so as to provide the desired biochemical characteristics such as reduced serum half-life. More particularly, one skilled in the art may readily isolate the genetic sequence corresponding to the variable and/or constant regions of the subject stabilized binding molecule and delete or alter the appropriate nucleotides to provide polypeptides of the invention for use as monomeric subunits in accordance with the instant invention.\n\n\nPreviously reported antibodies that react with tumor associated antigens may be stabilized as described herein to provide the stabilized binding molecules of the present invention. Exemplary antibodies that may be used to provide antigen binding regions to generate or derive the disclosed stabilized binding molecules include, but are not limited to 2B8 and C2B8 (Zevalin® and Rituxan®, IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corp., San Diego), Lym 1 and Lym 2 (Techniclone), LL2 (Immunomedics Corp., New Jersey), HER2 (Herceptin®, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco), B1 (Bexxar®, Coulter Pharm., San Francisco), Campath® (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge), abagovomab (Menarini, Italy), CEA-Scan™ (Immunomedics, Morris Plains, N.J.), capromab (Prostascint®, Cytogen Corp.), edrecolomab (Panorex®, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, N.J.), igovomab (C1S Bio Intl., France), mitumomab (BEC2, Imclone Systems, Somerville, N.J.), nofetumomab (Verluma®, Boehringer Ingleheim, Ridgefield, Conn.), OvaRex (Altarex Corp., Waltham, Mass.), satumomab (Onoscint®, Cytogen Corp.), cetuximab (Erbitux®, Imclone Systems, New York, N.Y.), bevacizumab (AVASTIN™, Genentech Inc., S. San Francisco, Calif.), apolizumab (REMITOGEN™, Protein Design Labs, Fremont, Calif.), labetuzumab (CEACIDE™, Immunomedics Inc., Morris Plains, N.J.), pertuzumab (OMNITARG™, Genentech Inc., S. San Francisco, Calif.), MB1, BH3, B4, B72.3 (Cytogen Corp.), CC49 (National Cancer Institute) and 5E10 (University of Iowa). Other binding sites that can be incorporated into the subject binding molecules include those found in: Orthoclone OKT3 (CD3), ReoPro (GpIIb/gIIa), Zenapax (C25), Remicade (TNF-α), Simulect (CD25), Synagis (RSV), Mylotarg (CD33), and Campath (CD52). In preferred embodiments, the stabilized binding molecules of the present invention will bind to the same tumor associated antigens as the antibodies enumerated immediately above. In particularly preferred embodiments, the stabilized binding molecules will be derived from or bind the same antigens as 2B8, C2B8, CC49 and C5E10 and, even more preferably, will lack all or part of a CH2 domain.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention may have one or more binding sites derived from one or more of the following antibodies. tositumomab (BEXXAR®), muromonab (ORTHOCLONE®) and ibritumomab (ZEVALIN®), cetuximab (ERBITUX™), rituximab (MABTHERA®/RITUXAN®), infliximab (REMICADE®), abciximab (REOPRO®) and basiliximab (SIMULECT®), efalizumab (RAPTIVA®, bevacizumab (AVASTIN®), alemtuzumab (CAMPATH®), trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN®), gemtuzumab (MYLOTARG®), palivizumab (SYNAGIS®), omalizumab (XOLAIR®), daclizumab (ZENAPAX®), natalizumab (TYSABRIS®) and ranibizumab (LUVENTIS®), adalimumab (HUMIRA®) and panitumumab (VECTIBIX®).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention binds to CD23 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,011,138). In a preferred embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention binds to the same epitope as the 5E8 antibody. In another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one CDR (e.g., at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 CDRs) from an anti-CD23 antibody, e.g., the 5E8 antibody.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention binds to a TNF receptor. In one exemplary embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention binds to a LTβR. In another exemplary embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention binds to a TRAIL receptor. In another embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one CDR (e.g., at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 CDRs) from an anti-TRAIL-R2 antibody (e.g. murine or chimeric 14A2). In another embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one CDR from an anti-LTβR antibody. Examples of anti-LTβR antibodies include BKA11, CDH10, BCG6, AGH1, BDA8, CBE11 and BHA10.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention binds to the CRIPTO-I antigen (WO02/088170A2 or WO03/083041A2). In a preferred embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention binds to the same epitope as the B3F6 antibody. In another embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one CDR from an anti-CRIPTO-I antibody, e.g., the B3F6 antibody.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the stabilized binding molecule will bind to the same tumor associated antigen as Rituxan®. Rituxan® (also known as, rituximab, IDEC-C2B8 and C2B8) was the first FDA-approved monoclonal antibody for treatment of human B-cell lymphoma (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,843,439; 5,776,456 and 5,736,137 each of which is incorporated herein by reference). Y2B8 (90Y labeled 2B8; Zevalin®; ibritumomab tiuxetan) is the murine parent of C2B8. Rituxan® is a chimeric, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody which is growth inhibitory and reportedly sensitizes certain lymphoma cell lines for apoptosis by chemotherapeutic agents in vitro. The antibody efficiently binds human complement, has strong FcR binding, and can effectively kill human lymphocytes in vitro via both complement dependent (CDC) and antibody-dependent (ADCC) mechanisms (Reff et al., Blood 83: 435-445 (1994)). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that dimeric variants (homodimers or heterodimers) of C2B8 or 2B8, modified according to the instant disclosure, may be used in conjugated or unconjugated forms to effectively treat patients presenting with CD20+ malignancies. More generally, it must be reiterated that the stabilized binding molecule disclosed herein may be used in either a “naked” or unconjugated state or conjugated to a cytotoxic agent to effectively treat any one of a number of disorders.\n\n\nIn other preferred embodiments of the present invention, the stabilized binding molecule of the invention will be derived from, or bind to, the same tumor associated antigen as CC49. CC49 binds human tumor associated antigen TAG-72 which is associated with the surface of certain tumor cells of human origin, specifically the LS174T tumor cell line. LS174T [American Type Culture Collection (herein ATCC) No. CL 188] is a variant of the LS180 (ATCC No. CL 187) colon adenocarcinoma line. It will further be appreciated that numerous murine monoclonal antibodies have been developed which have binding specificity for TAG-72. One of these monoclonal antibodies, designated B72.3, is a murine IgG1 produced by hybridoma B72.3 (ATCC No. HB-8108). B72.3 is a first generation monoclonal antibody developed using a human breast carcinoma extract as the immunogen (see Colcher et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 78:3199-3203 (1981); and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,522,918 and 4,612,282 each of which is incorporated herein by reference). Other monoclonal antibodies directed against TAG-72 are designated “CC” (for colon cancer). As described by Schlom et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,443 which is incorporated herein by reference) CC monoclonal antibodies are a family of second generation murine monoclonal antibodies that were prepared using TAG-72 purified with B72.3. Because of their relatively good binding affinities to TAG-72, the following CC antibodies have been deposited at the ATCC, with restricted access having been requested: CC49 (ATCC No. HB 9459); CC 83 (ATCC No. HB 9453); CC46 (ATCC No. HB 9458); CC92 (ATTCC No. HB 9454); CC30 (ATCC No. HB 9457); CC11 (ATCC No. 9455); and CC15 (ATCC No. HB 9460). U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,443 further teaches that the disclosed antibodies may be altered into their chimeric form by substituting, e.g., human constant regions (Fc) domains for mouse constant regions by recombinant DNA techniques known in the art. Besides disclosing murine and chimeric anti-TAG-72 antibodies, Schlom et al. have also produced variants of a humanized CC49 antibody as disclosed in PCT/US99/25552 and single chain constructs as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,892,019 each of which is also incorporated herein by reference. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that each of the foregoing antibodies, constructs or recombinants, and variations thereof, may be modified and used to provide polypeptides in accordance with the present invention.\n\n\nIn addition to the anti-TAG-72 antibodies discussed above, various groups have also reported the construction and partial characterization of domain-deleted CC49 and B72.3 antibodies (e.g., Calvo et al. Cancer Biotherapy, 8(1):95-109 (1993), Slavin-Chiorini et al. Int. J. Cancer 53:97-103 (1993) and Slavin-Chiorini et al. Cancer. Res. 55:5957-5967 (1995\n\n\nStill other preferred embodiments of the present invention comprise binding sites that are derived from or bind to the same tumor associated antigen as C5E10. As set forth in co-pending application Ser. No. 09/104,717, CSE10 is an antibody that recognizes a glycoprotein determinant of approximately 115 kDa that appears to be specific to prostate tumor cell lines (e.g. DU145, PC3, or ND1). Thus, in conjunction with the present invention, stabilized binding molecules (e.g. CH2 domain-deleted antibodies) that specifically bind to the same tumor associated antigen recognized by C5E10 antibodies could be produced and used in a conjugated or unconjugated form for the treatment of neoplastic disorders. In particularly preferred embodiments, the stabilized binding molecule will be derived or comprise all or part of the antigen binding region of the C5E10 antibody as secreted from the hybridoma cell line having ATCC accession No. PTA-865. The resulting stabilized binding molecule could then be conjugated to a radionuclide as described below and administered to a patient suffering from prostate cancer in accordance with the methods herein.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the stabilized binding molecules of the invention have at least one of the binding specificities described herein, e.g., in Section C infra. In another embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention may bind to a target molecule of interest, e.g., described herein, e.g., in section B or C, infra.\n\n\nPreviously reported antibodies that react with antigens associated with immune-cell disorders (e.g., B-cell disorders) may be stabilized as described herein to provide the stabilized binding molecules of the present invention. Exemplary antibodies that may be used to provide antigen binding regions to generate or derive the disclosed stabilized binding molecules include, but are not limited to an anti-TNFα antibody (e.g., infliximab (Remicade®, Centocor, Horsham, Pa.); MAK195-F (Abbott Labs., Abbott Park, Ill.); adalimumab (Humira®, Abbott Labs, Abbott Park, Ill.); an anti-CD3 antibody (e.g., Orthoclone (OKT3®, OrthoBiotech, Bridgewater, N.J.); MEDI-500 (Medimmune, Gaithersburg, Md.); visilizumab (NUVION®, Protein Design Labs (Fremont, Calif., USA)), an anti-IgE antibody (e.g., omalizumab, XOLAIR®, Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif.), an anti-VLA-4 antibody (e.g., TYSABRI®, BiogenIdec, Cambridge, Mass.), an anti-CD147 antibody (e.g., ABX-CBL (Abgenix, Fremont, Calif.)), an anti-CD25 antibody (e.g., basiliximab, Simulect® (East Hanover, N.J.); Inolimomab (OPI, France), an anti-CD18 antibody (e.g., odulimomab, Antilfa®, Pateur Meriuex, France), anti-NCA90 (e.g., sulesomab, Leukoscan®, Immunomedics, Morris Plains, N.J.), an anti-GpIIb/gIIa antibody (e.g., abciximab, ReoPro®, Centocor, Horsham, Pa.), an anti-C25 antibody (e.g., Zenapax), an anti-CD33 antibody (e.g., Mylotarg), and an anti-CD25 antibody (e.g., alemtuzumab, Campath® (Milleneum Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Mass.). In preferred embodiments, the stabilized binding molecules of the present invention will bind to the same immune-cell associated antigens as the antibodies enumerated immediately above.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the term, “modified antibody” according to the present invention includes immunoglobulins, antibodies, or immunoreactive fragments or recombinants thereof, in which at least a fraction of one or more of the constant region domains has been deleted or otherwise altered so as to provide desired biochemical characteristics such as the ability to non-covalently dimerize, increased ability to localize at the site of a tumor, or reduced serum half-life when compared with a whole, unaltered antibody of approximately the same immunogenicity. In a preferred embodiment, the polypeptides of the present invention are domain deleted antibodies which comprise a polypeptide chain similar to an immunoglobulin heavy chain, but which lack at least a portion of one or more heavy chain domains. In one embodiment, one entire domain of the constant region of the stabilized binding protein will be deleted. In another embodiment, all or part of the CH2 domain will be deleted.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the stabilized binding proteins of the invention are minibodies. Minibodies are dimeric molecules made up of two polypeptide chains each comprising a stabilized scFv molecule (a single polypeptide comprising one or more antigen binding sites, e.g., a VL domain linked by a flexible linker to a VH domain fused to a CH3 domain via a connecting peptide.\n\n\nMinibodies can be made by constructing an scFv component and connecting peptide-CH3 component using methods described in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,821 or WO 94/09817A1). These components can be isolated from separate plasmids as restriction fragments and then ligated and recloned into an appropriate vector. Appropriate assembly can be verified by restriction digestion and DNA sequence analysis.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a tetravalent minibody can be constructed. Tetravalent minibodies can be constructed in the same manner as minibodies, except that two scFv molecules are linked using a flexible linker, e.g., having an amino acid sequence (G\n4\nS)\n4\nG\n3\nAS (SEQ ID NO: 23).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, tetravalent antibodies can be produced by combining a DNA sequence encoding an antibody with a scFv molecule. For example, in one embodiment, these sequences are combined such that the scFv molecule is linked at its N-terminus to the CH3 domain of the antibody via a flexible linker (e.g., a gly/ser linker such as (Gly\n4\nSer)\n3\n.\n\n\nIn another embodiment a tetravalent antibody can be made by fusing n stabilized scFv molecule to a connecting peptide, which is fused to a CH1 domain to construct a stabilized scFv-Fab tetravalent molecule (Coloma and Morrison. 1997. Nature Biotechnology. 15:159; WO 95/09917).\n\n\nIn one embodiment a stabilized binding molecule of the invention comprises a tetravalent or bispecific tetravalent antibody with an scFv appended to the N-terminus of the light chain. In another embodiment of the invention, a binding molecule comprises a tetravalent or bispecific tetravalent CH2 domain-deleted antibody with an scFv appended to the N-terminus of the heavy chain. In one embodiment, the attachment of the scFv to the N-terminus results in reduced aggregation of the molecules as compared to molecules in which the scFv is attached at the carboxy-terminus.\n\n\nAntibodies or fragments thereof for use in a stabilized binding molecule of the invention may be obtained using art recognized protocols, for example, antibodies are preferably raised in mammals by multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections of the relevant antigen (e.g., purified tumor associated antigens or cells or cellular extracts comprising such antigens) and an adjuvant. This immunization typically elicits an immune response that comprises production of antigen-reactive antibodies from activated splenocytes or lymphocytes. While the resulting antibodies may be harvested from the serum of the animal to provide polyclonal preparations, it is often desirable to isolate individual lymphocytes from the spleen, lymph nodes or peripheral blood to provide homogenous preparations of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Preferably, the lymphocytes are obtained from the spleen.\n\n\nIn this well known process (Kohler et al., \nNature, \n256:495 (1975)) the relatively short-lived, or mortal, lymphocytes from a mammal which has been injected with antigen are fused with an immortal tumor cell line (e.g. a myeloma cell line), thus, producing hybrid cells or “hybridomas” which are both immortal and capable of producing the genetically coded antibody of the B cell. The resulting hybrids are segregated into single genetic strains by selection, dilution, and regrowth with each individual strain comprising specific genes for the formation of a single antibody. They produce antibodies which are homogeneous against a desired antigen and, in reference to their pure genetic parentage, are termed “monoclonal.”\n\n\nHybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that reagents, cell lines and media for the formation, selection and growth of hybridomas are commercially available from a number of sources and standardized protocols are well established. Generally, culture medium in which the hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies against the desired antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of the monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro assay, such as a radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, \nMonoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice\n, pp 59-103 (Academic Press, 1986)). It will further be appreciated that the monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones may be separated from culture medium, ascites fluid or serum by conventional purification procedures such as, for example, protein-A, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis or affinity chromatography.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, DNA encoding desired monoclonal antibodies may be readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies). The isolated and subcloned hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated, the DNA may be placed into expression vectors, which are then transfected into prokaryotic or eukaryotic host cells such as \nE. coli \ncells, simian COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulins. More particularly, the isolated DNA (which may be synthetic as described herein) may be used to clone constant and variable region sequences for the manufacture antibodies as described in Newman et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,570, filed Jan. 25, 1995, which is incorporated by reference herein. Essentially, this entails extraction of RNA from the selected cells, conversion to cDNA, and amplification by PCR using Ig specific primers. Suitable primers for this purpose are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,570. As will be discussed in more detail below, transformed cells expressing the desired antibody may be grown up in relatively large quantities to provide clinical and commercial supplies of the immunoglobulin.\n\n\nThose skilled in the art will also appreciate that DNA encoding antibodies or antibody fragments (e.g., antigen binding sites) may also be derived from antibody phage libraries, e.g., using pd phage or Fd phagemid technology. Exemplary methods are set forth, for example, in EP 368 684 B1; U.S. Pat. No. 5,969,108, Hoogenboom, H. R. and Chames. 2000\n. Immunol. Today \n21:371; Nagy et al. 2002\n. Nat. Med. \n8:801; Huie et al. 2001\n. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n98:2682; Lui et al. 2002\n. J. Mol. Biol. \n315:1063, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Several publications (e.g., Marks et al. \nBio/Technology \n10:779-783 (1992)) have described the production of high affinity human antibodies by chain shuffling, as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing large phage libraries. In another embodiment, Ribosomal display can be used to replace bacteriophage as the display platform (see, e.g., Hanes et al. 2000\n. Nat. Biotechnol. \n18:1287; Wilson et al. 2001\n. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n98:3750; or Irving et al. 2001 \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n248:31. In yet another embodiment, cell surface libraries can be screened for antibodies (Boder et al. 2000. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97:10701; Daugherty et al. 2000 \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n243:211. Such procedures provide alternatives to traditional hybridoma techniques for the isolation and subsequent cloning of monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the present invention a binding site of a binding molecule of the invention may be provided by a human or substantially human antibody. Human or substantially human antibodies may be made in transgenic animals (e.g., mice) that are incapable of endogenous immunoglobulin production (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,075,181, 5,939,598, 5,591,669 and 5,589,369 each of which is incorporated herein by reference). For example, it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy-chain joining region in chimeric and germ-line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of a human immunoglobulin gene array to such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. Another preferred means of generating human antibodies using SCID mice is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,524 which is incorporated herein by reference. It will be appreciated that the genetic material associated with these human antibodies may also be isolated and manipulated as described herein.\n\n\nYet another highly efficient means for generating recombinant antibodies is disclosed by Newman, \nBiotechnology, \n10: 1455-1460 (1992). Specifically, this technique results in the generation of primatized antibodies that contain monkey variable domains and human constant sequences. This reference is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. Moreover, this technique is also described in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,658,570, 5,693,780 and 5,756,096 each of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, lymphocytes can be selected by micromanipulation and the variable genes isolated. For example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells can be isolated from an immunized mammal and cultured for about 7 days in vitro. The cultures can be screened for specific IgGs that meet the screening criteria. Cells from positive wells can be isolated. Individual Ig-producing B cells can be isolated by FACS or by identifying them in a complement-mediated hemolytic plaque assay. Ig-producing B cells can be micromanipulated into a tube and the VH and VL genes can be amplified using, e.g., RT-PCR. The VH and VL genes can be cloned into an antibody expression vector and transfected into cells (e.g., eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells) for expression.\n\n\nMoreover, genetic sequences useful for producing the binding molecules of the present invention may be obtained from a number of different sources. For example, as discussed extensively above, a variety of human antibody genes are available in the form of publicly accessible deposits. Many sequences of antibodies and antibody-encoding genes have been published and suitable antibody genes can be chemically synthesized from these sequences using art recognized techniques. Oligonucleotide synthesis techniques compatible with this aspect of the invention are well known to the skilled artisan and may be carried out using any of several commercially available automated synthesizers. In addition, DNA sequences encoding several types of heavy and light chains set forth herein can be obtained through the services of commercial DNA synthesis vendors. The genetic material obtained using any of the foregoing methods may then be altered or synthetic to provide obtain polypeptides of the present invention.\n\n\nAlternatively, antibody-producing cell lines may be selected and cultured using techniques well known to the skilled artisan. Such techniques are described in a variety of laboratory manuals and primary publications. In this respect, techniques suitable for use in the invention as described below are described in \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology\n, Coligan et al., Eds., Green Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, John Wiley and Sons, New York (1991) which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, including supplements.\n\n\nIt will further be appreciated that the scope of this invention encompasses stabilized binding molecules comprising alleles, variants and mutations of art recognized antigen binding DNA sequences and a stabilized scFv molecule of the invention.\n\n\nAs is well known, RNA may be isolated from the original hybridoma cells or from other transformed cells by standard techniques, such as guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and precipitation followed by centrifugation or chromatography. Where desirable, mRNA may be isolated from total RNA by standard techniques such as chromatography on oligo dT cellulose. Suitable techniques are familiar in the art.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, cDNAs that encode the light and the heavy chains of the antibody may be made, either simultaneously or separately, using reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase in accordance with well known methods. PCR may be initiated by consensus constant region primers or by more specific primers based on the published heavy and light chain DNA and amino acid sequences. As discussed above, PCR also may be used to isolate DNA clones encoding the antibody light and heavy chains. In this case the libraries may be screened by consensus primers or larger homologous probes, such as mouse constant region probes.\n\n\nDNA, typically plasmid DNA, may be isolated from the cells using techniques known in the art, restriction mapped and sequenced in accordance with standard, well known techniques set forth in detail, e.g., in the foregoing references relating to recombinant DNA techniques. Of course, the DNA may be synthetic according to the present invention at any point during the isolation process or subsequent analysis. Exemplary antibodies or fragments thereof for use in the binding molecules of the invention include antibodies that recognize the targets set forth herein.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, antigen binding fragments of antibodies can be produced using techniques well known in the art.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention may comprise a complete antibody molecule and a stabilized scFv molecule. In another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention may comprise a portion of an antibody molecule and a a stabilized scFv molecule.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises a fragment or portion of an antibody and a stabilized scFv molecule. For example, in one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention may comprise a domain deleted antibody and a stabilized scFv molecule. Domain deleted antibodies are antibody molecules in which one or more domains are partially or entirely deleted. In especially preferred embodiments compatible stabilized binding molecules will comprise domain deleted constructs or variants wherein the entire CH2 domain has been removed (ΔCH2 constructs). For other preferred embodiments a short connecting peptide may be substituted for the deleted domain to provide flexibility and freedom of movement for the variable region. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that such constructs are particularly preferred due to the regulatory properties of the CH2 domain on the catabolic rate of the antibody.\n\n\nDomain deleted constructs can be derived using a vector (e.g., from IDEC Pharmaceuticals, San Diego) encoding an IgG\n1 \nhuman constant domain (see, e.g., WO 02/060955A2 and WO02/096948A2). It will be noted that these exemplary constructs were engineered to fuse the CH3 domain directly to a hinge region of the respective polypeptides of the invention. In other constructs it may be desirable to provide a peptide spacer between the hinge region and the synthetic CH2 and/or CH3 domains. For example, compatible constructs could be expressed wherein the CH2 domain has been deleted and the remaining CH3 domain (synthetic or unsynthetic) is joined to the hinge region with a 5-20 amino acid spacer. Such a spacer may be added, for instance, to ensure that the regulatory elements of the constant domain remain free and accessible or that the hinge region remains flexible. For example, a domain deleted B3F6 construct having a short amino acid spacer substituted for the CH2 domain and the lower hinge region (B3F6.ΔCH2 [gly/ser]) can be used. Other exemplary connecting peptides are known in the art (see, e.g., International PCT Application Nos. WO 2005/000898 and WO 2005/000899). These connecting peptides can be used in connection with the binding molecules of the invention. Preferably, the connecting peptides are used with a polypeptide lacking a CH2 heavy chain domain. Preferably, any connecting peptide compatible with the instant invention will be relatively non-immunogenic and not inhibit the non-covalent association of the polypeptides of the invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises an immunoglobulin heavy chain having deletion or substitution of a few or even a single amino acid as long as it permits the desired covalent or non-covalent association between the monomeric subunits. For example, the mutation of a single amino acid in selected areas of the CH2 domain may be enough to substantially reduce Fc binding and thereby increase tumor localization. Similarly, it may be desirable to simply delete that part of one or more constant region domains that control the effector function (e.g. complement binding) to be modulated. Such partial deletions of the constant regions may improve selected characteristics of the antibody (serum half-life) while leaving other desirable functions associated with the subject constant region domain intact. Moreover, as alluded to above, the constant regions of the disclosed antibodies may be synthetic through the mutation or substitution of one or more amino acids that enhances the profile of the resulting construct. In this respect it may be possible to disrupt the activity provided by a conserved binding site (e.g. Fc binding) while substantially maintaining the configuration and immunogenic profile of the stabilized binding molecule. Yet other preferred embodiments may comprise the addition of one or more amino acids to the constant region to enhance desirable characteristics such as effector function or provide for more cytotoxin or carbohydrate attachment. In such embodiments it may be desirable to insert or replicate specific sequences derived from selected constant region domains.\n\n\nIt is known in the art that the constant region mediates several effector functions. For example, binding of the C1 component of complement to antibodies activates the complement system. Activation of complement is important in the opsonisation and lysis of cell pathogens. The activation of complement also stimulates the inflammatory response and may also be involved in autoimmune hypersensitivity. Further, antibodies bind to cells via the Fc region, with a Fc receptor site on the antibody Fc region binding to a Fc receptor (FcR) on a cell. There are a number of Fc receptors which are specific for different classes of antibody, including IgG (gamma receptors), IgE (epsilon receptors), IgA (alpha receptors) and IgM (mu receptors). Binding of antibody to Fc receptors on cell surfaces triggers a number of important and diverse biological responses including engulfment and destruction of antibody-coated particles, clearance of immune complexes, lysis of antibody-coated target cells by killer cells (called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or ADCC), release of inflammatory mediators, placental transfer and control of immunoglobulin production.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, effector functions may be eliminated or reduced by using a constant region of an IgG4 antibody, which is thought to be unable to deplete target cells, or making Fc variants, wherein residues in the Fc region critical for effector function(s) are mutated using techniques known in the art, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,097. For example, the deletion or inactivation (through point mutations or other means) of a constant region domain may reduce Fc receptor binding of the circulating stabilized binding molecule thereby increasing tumor localization. In other cases it may be that constant region modifications consistent with the instant invention moderate compliment binding and thus reduce the serum half life and nonspecific association of a conjugated cytotoxin. Yet other modifications of the constant region may be used to modify disulfide linkages or oligosaccharide molecules that allow for enhanced localization due to increased antigen specificity or antibody flexibility. More generally, those skilled in the art will realize that antibodies modified as described herein may exert a number of subtle effects that may or may not be readily appreciated. However the resulting physiological profile, bioavailability and other biochemical effects of the modifications, such as tumor localization, biodistribution and serum half-life, may easily be measured and quantified using well know immunological techniques without undue experimentation.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, modified forms of antibodies can be made from a whole precursor or parent antibody using techniques known in the art. Exemplary techniques are discussed in more detail herein.\n\n\nB. Modified Fusion Proteins\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention is a modified fusion protein. In one exemplary embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is a fusion protein comprising a stabilized scFv molecule linked to the ligand-binding region of a receptor, an adhesion molecule, a ligand, or an enzyme. In another exemplary embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is fusion protein comprising a stabilized scFv molecule linked to a receptor binding portion of ligand. For example a binding molecule of the invention is fusion protein comprising a stabilized scFv molecule to one or more of the following molecules:\n\n\nCytokines and Cytokine Receptors\n\n\nCytokines have pleiotropic effects on the proliferation, differentiation, and functional activation of lymphocytes. Various cytokines, or receptor binding portions thereof, can be utilized in the fusion proteins of the invention.

Nos. 4,925,793 and 4,929,554).\n\n\nCytokine receptors typically consist of a ligand-specific alpha chain and a common beta chain.

No. 5,453,491), IFNγ (EP0240975), and the TNF family of receptors (e.g., TNFα (e.g. TNFR-1 (EP 417, 563), TNFR-2 (EP 417,014) lymphotoxin beta receptor).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, an scFv molecule of the invention may bind to a cytokine or a cytokine receptor.\n\n\nAdhesion Proteins\n\n\nAdhesion molecules are membrane-bound proteins that allow cells to interact with one another. Various adhesion proteins, including leukocyte homing receptors and cellular adhesion molecules, of receptor binding portions thereof, can be incorporated in a binding molecule of the invention. Leucocyte homing receptors are expressed on leucocyte cell surfaces during inflammation and include the β-1 integrins (e.g. VLA-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) which mediate binding to extracellular matrix components, and the β2-integrins (e.g. LFA-1, LPAM-1, CR3, and CR4) which bind cellular adhesion molecules (CAMs) on vascular endothelium. Exemplary CAMs include ICAM-1, ICAM-2, VCAM-1, and MAdCAM-1. Other CAMs include those of the selectin family including E-selectin, L-selectin, and P-selectin.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, an scFv molecule of the invention may bind to an adhesion protein or an adhesion protein receptor.\n\n\nChemokines\n\n\nChemokines, chemotactic proteins which stimulate the migration of leucocytes towards a site of infection or chemokine receptor binding portions thereof, can also be incorporated into a binding molecule of the invention. Exemplary chemokines include Macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP-1-α and MIP-1-β), neutrophil chemotactic factor, and RANTES (regulated on activation normally T-cell expressed and secreted).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, an scFv molecule of the invention may bind to a chemokine or a receptor.\n\n\nGrowth Factors and Growth Factor Receptors\n\n\nGrowth factors or their receptors (or receptor binding or ligand binding portions thereof) or molecules which bind to them may be incorporated in the binding molecule of the invention. Exemplary growth factors include angiopoietin, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and its isoforms (U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,596); Epidermal Growth Factors (EGFs); Fibroblastic Growth Factors (FGF), including aFGF and bFGF; atrial natriuretic factor (ANF); hepatic growth factors (HGFs; U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,227,158 and 6,099,841), neurotrophic factors such as bone-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3, -4, -5, or -6 (NT-3, NT-4, NT-5, or NT-6), or a nerve growth factor such as NGF-β platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,889,919, 4,845,075, 5,910,574, and 5,877,016); transforming growth factors (TGF) such as TGF-alpha and TGF-beta (WO 90/14359), osteoinductive factors including bone morphogenetic protein (BMP); insulin-like growth factors-I and -II (IGF-I and IGF-II; U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,403,764 and 6,506,874); Erythropoietin (EPO); stem-cell factor (SCF), thrombopoietin (c-Mpl ligand), and the Wnt polypeptides (U.S. Pat. No. 6,159,462).\n\n\nExemplary growth factor receptors which may be used include EGF receptors (EGFRs); VEGF receptors (e.g. Flt1 or Flk1/KDR), PDGF receptors (WO 90/14425); HGF receptors (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,648,273, and 5,686,292); IGF receptors (e.g. IGFR1 and IGFR2) and neurotrophic receptors including the low affinity receptor (LNGFR), also termed as p75\nNTR \nor p75, which binds NGF, BDNF, and NT-3, and high affinity receptors that are members of the trk family of the receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. trkA, trkB (EP 455,460), trkC (EP 522,530)). In another embodiment, both IGFR1 and VEGF are targeted. In yet another embodiment, VLA4 and VEGF are targeted. In another embodiment, both LFA1 and VLA4 are targeted.\n\n\nOther cell surface receptors and/or their ligands can also be targeted (e.g., the TNF family receptors or their ligands (as described in more detail herein).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, an scFv molecule of the invention may bind to a growth factor or growth factor receptor.\n\n\nHormones\n\n\nExemplary growth hormones or molecules which bind to them for use as targeting agents in a binding molecule of the invention include renin, human growth hormone (HGH; U.S. Pat. No. 5,834,598), N-methionyl human growth hormone; bovine growth hormone; growth hormone releasing factor; parathyroid hormone (PTH); thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH); thyroxine; proinsulin and insulin (U.S. Pat.

As is well-known in the art, an immunoadhesin is a fusion protein that combines the target-binding region of a receptor, an adhesion molecule, a ligand, or an enzyme, with the Fc region of an antibody. Exemplary immunoadhesins are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,116,964; 5,428,130; 5,714,147; and 6,406,697, each of which is incorporated by reference herein. In one embodiment, a modified immunoadhesin of the invention is formed by linking a stabilized scFv molecule to an immunoadhesin.\n\n\nPreviously reported immunoadhesins may be stabilized as described herein to provide the modified immunoadhesins of the present invention. Exemplary immunoadhesins that may be used to generate or derive the disclosed modified immunoadhesin include, but are not limited to, abatecept (Orencia®, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Princeton, N.J.), alefacept (Amevive®, BiogenIdec, Cambridge, Mass.), etanercept (Enbrel), Amgen, Thousand Oaks, Calif.), SMART™ Anti-Gamma Interferon (Protein Design Labs, Fremont, Calif.), SMART™ Anti-L-Selectin (Protein Design Labs.

San Francisco, Calif.).\n\n\nAnother exemplary molecule that may be included in a binding molecule of the invention is immunoglobulin super family member 9 (IGSF9; Genomics. 2002. 79:663-70).\n\n\nC. Binding Specificity\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention binds to a target molecule that is present on the surface of a cell or that is soluble.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, at least one binding specificity of a binding molecule of the invention is catalytic. Catalytic binding specificities can be made using art recognized techniques (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,590,080, U.S. Pat. No. 5,658,753). Catalytic binding specificities can work by a number of basic mechanisms similar to those identified for enzymes to stabilize the transition state, thereby reducing the free energy of activation. For example, general acid and base residues can be optimally positioned for participation in catalysis within catalytic active sites; covalent enzyme-substrate intermediates can be formed; catalytic antibodies can also be in proper orientation for reaction and increase the effective concentration of reactants by at least seven orders of magnitude (Fersht, A. R., et al., Am. Chem. Soc. 90 (1968):5833) and thereby greatly reduce the entropy of a chemical reaction. Finally, catalytic antibodies can convert the energy obtained upon substrate binding to distort the reaction towards a structure resembling the transition state.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, acid or base residues can be brought into the binding site by using a complementary charged molecule as an immunogen. This technique proved successful for elicitation of antibodies with a hapten containing a positively-charged ammonium ion (Shokat, et al., Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 27 (1988):269-271).\n\n\nIn another approach, antibodies can be elicited to stable compounds that resemble the size, shape, and charge of the transition state of a desired reaction (i.e., transition state analogs). See U.S. Pat. No. 4,792,446 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,963,355 which describe the use of transition state analogues to immunize animals and the production of catalytic antibodies. Both of these patents are hereby incorporated by reference. In one embodiment, such molecules can be administered as part of an immunoconjugate, e.g., with an immunogenic carrier molecule, such as KLH.\n\n\nExemplary catalytic binding specificities can have, e.g., esterase activity (involving a charged transition state whose electrostatic and shape characteristics can be mimicked by a phosphonate structure; Jacobs, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 109 (1987):2174-2176; Durfor, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110 (1988):8713-8714; Tramontano, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110 (1988):2282; Pollack, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111 (1989):5961-5962); peptidase or amidase activity (Janda, et al., Science 241 (1988):1188-1191; Iverson, et al., Science 243 (1989):1184-1188; Paul, et al., Science 244 (1989):1158-1162); Claisen rearrangement (Jackson, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110 (1988):4841-4842; Hilvert, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 (1988):4953-4955; Hilvert, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110 (1988):5593-5594); redox reactions (Shokat, et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 27 (1989):269-271); photochemical cleavage of a thymine dimer (Cochran, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 110 (1988):7888-7890); stereospecific transesterification rearrangements (Napper, et al., Science 237 (1987):1041-1043); or a bimolecular amide synthesis (Benkovic, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 (1988):5355-5358; Janda, et al., Science 241 (1988):1188-1191).\n\n\nIn another approach, conventional binding specificities can be mutated to render them catalytic.\n\n\nMethods of screening for catalytic antibody activity are well known in the art (e.g., Reymond, J. L. 2002. Journal of Immunological Methods 269:125; Mouratou et al. 2002. J. of Immunological Methods. 269:147. In yet another embodiment, catalytic B cells can be selected, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,590,080 using a molecule can be constructed which facilitates selection of catalytic B cells.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, catalytic binding specificities can be developed as part of a two step process. Catalytic antibodies can be selected only if displaying the following binding features: binding both the substrate and a reactive group in such a way that the two groups are in a reactive position towards each other. Second, the selected antibodies can be chemically engineered by covalently binding a reactive group into the binding pocket of the antibody. J Immunol Methods. 2002. 269:81-98.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a catalytic binding specificity is specific for a prodrug. Such a binding specificity can be used to catalyze the conversion of a prodrug into a drug which is effective in vivo. Preferably, the reaction catalyzed is one that cannot be accomplished by natural enzymes in vivo. Examples of prodrug activation by antibodies are known in the art (see, e.g., Miyashita et al. 1993. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:5337).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one binding specificity for a target cell and at least one binding specificity for a prodrug. For example, in a preferred embodiment, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one binding specificity for a tumor cell and at least one binding specificity for a prodrug which can be converted to cytotoxic drug. In one example, a stabilized binding molecule of the invention comprises a binding specificity for a carbamate prodrug 4-[N,N,-bis(2-chloroethyl)]aminophenyl-N-[(1S-(1,3-dicarboxy)propyl]carbamate and generates the corresponding cytotoxic nitrogen mustard (Wentworth et al. 1996. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 93:799).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, binding molecule is administered prior to administration of the prodrug to allow accumulation at the site of the target cell. Exemplary prodrugs are known in the art. Prodrugs can also be synthesized by incorporating a portion designed to be released by catalytic action, e.g., by sequential retro-aldol/retro-Michael reactions catalyzed by an antibody with aldolase activity. (Shabat et al. 2001. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98:7428). Such drug masking portions can be made, e.g., by modification of hydroxyl or thiol groups of drugs.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is multispecific, i.e., has at least one binding site that binds to a first target molecule or epitope of the target molecule and at least one second binding site that binds to a second, different target molecule or to a second, different epitope of the first target molecule. In certain embodiments, multispecific binding molecules of the invention (e.g. bispecific binding molecules) comprise at least one binding site from any of the antibodies described in herein, e.g., Section A, supra.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is bispecific. Bispecific molecules can bind to two different target sites, e.g., on the same target molecule or on different target molecules. For example, in the case of antibodies, bispecific molecules can bind to two different epitopes, e.g., on the same antigen or on two different antigens. Bispecific molecules can be used, e.g., in diagnostic and therapeutic applications. For example, they can be used to immobilize enzymes for use in immunoassays. They can also be used in diagnosis and treatment of cancer, e.g., by binding both to a tumor associated molecule and a detectable marker (e.g., a chelator which tightly binds a radionuclide. Bispecific molecules can also be used for human therapy, e.g., by directing cytotoxicity to a specific target (for example by binding to a pathogen or tumor cell and to a cytotoxic trigger molecule, such as the T cell receptor or the Fcγ receptor. Bispecific antibodies can also be used, e.g., as fibrinolytic agents or vaccine adjuvants.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention include those with at least one arm (ie. binding site) directed against a cell-surface molecule, and at least one arm directed against a soluble molecule. In another embodiment, a multispecific antibody of the invention has two binding sites that bind to soluble molecules. In another embodiment, a multispecific antibody of the invention has two binding sites that bind to cell surface molecules.\n\n\nThe multispecific binding molecules of the invention may be monovalent for each specificity or multivalent for each specificity. In one embodiment, a bispecific binding molecule of the invention may comprise one binding site that reacts with a first target molecule and one binding site that reacts with a second target molecule (e.g. a bispecific antibody molecule, fusion protein, or minibody). In another embodiment, a bispecific binding molecule of the invention may comprise two binding sites that react with a first target molecule and two binding sites that react with a second target molecule (e.g. a bispecific scFv2 tetravalent antibody, tetravalent minibody, or diabody).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, at least one binding site of a multispecific binding molecule of the invention is an antigen binding region of an antibody or an antigen binding fragment thereof.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention are bivalent antibodies or antibody variants with one arm containing at least one stabilized scFv directed to a first target molecule and a second arm containing at least one stabilized scFv directed to a second target molecule.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention comprise at least one stabilized scFv (e.g. 2, 3, or 4 scFvs) linked to the C-terminus of a heavy chain, wherein the scFvs have the same or different binding specificity. An exemplary binding molecule of this type (a “C-Hercules” antibody) is shown in \nFIG. 13\n. In another embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention comprise at least one stabilized scFv (e.g. 2, 3, or 4 scFvs) linked to the N-terminus of a heavy chain, wherein the scFvs have the same or different binding specificity. An exemplary binding molecule of this type (a “N\nH\n-Hercules” antibody) is shown in \nFIG. 13\n. In another embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention comprise at least one stabilized scFv (e.g. 2, 3, or 4 scFvs) linked to the N-terminus of a light chain, wherein the scFvs have the same or different binding specificity. An exemplary binding molecule of this type (a “N\nL\n-Hercules” antibody) is shown in \nFIG. 13\n. In another embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention comprise at least one stabilized scFv (e.g., 2, 3, or 4 scFvs linked to the N-terminus of the heavy chain or light chain and at least one stabilized scFv (e.g., 2, 3, or 4 scFvs) linked to the C-terminus of the heavy chain, wherein the scFvs have the same or different binding specificity.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention are bivalent minibodies with one arm containing at least one scFv fragment directed to a first target molecule and a second arm containing at least one scFv directed to a second target molecule wherein at least one of the scFv molecules is stabilized. An exemplary bispecific bivalent minibody construct is shown in \nFIG. 42\n. In \nFIG. 42\n a CH3 domain is fused at its N-terminus to a connecting peptide which is fused at its N-terminus to a VH domain which is fused via its N-terminus to a (Gly4Ser)\nn \nflexible linker which is fused at its N-terminus to a VL domain.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention are scFv tetravalent minibodies, with each heavy chain portion of the scFv tetravalent minibody containing first and second scFv fragments wherein at least one of the scFv molecules is stabilized. Said second scFv fragment may be linked to the N-terminus of the first scFv fragment (e.g. bispecific N\nH \nscFv tetravalent minibodies or bispecific N\nL \nscFv tetravalent minibodies). An example of a bispecific N-scFv tetravalent minibody is shown in \nFIG. 43\n. Alternatively, the second scFv fragment may be linked to the C-terminus of said heavy chain portion containing said first scFv fragment (e.g. bispecific C-scFv tetravalent minibodies). An example of a bispecific C-scFv tetravalent minibody is shown in \nFIG. 44\n. In one embodiment, the first and second scFv fragments of may bind the same or different target molecule. Where the first and second scFv fragments of a first heavy chain portion of a bispecific tetravalent minibody bind the same target molecule, at least one of the first and second scFv fragments of the second heavy chain portion of the bispecific tetravalent minibody binds a different target molecule.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention are bispecific diabodies, with each arm of the diabody comprising tandem scFv fragments at least one of which is stabilized. In one embodiment, a bispecific diabody may comprise a first arm with a first binding specificity and a second arm with a second binding specificity (see, for example, \nFIG. 45\n). In another embodiment, each arm of the diabody may comprise a first scFv fragment with a first binding specificity and a second scFv fragment with a second binding specificity.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention are scFv2 tetravalent antibodies with each heavy chain portion of the scFv2 tetravalent antibody containing an scFv molecule, wherein at least one of the scFv molecules are stabilized. The scFv fragments may be linked to the N-termini of a variable region of the heavy chain portions (e.g. bispecific N\nH \nscFv2 tetravalent antibodies or bispecific N\nL \nscFv2 tetravalent antibodies). Alternatively, the scFv fragments may be linked to the C-termini of the heavy chain portions of the scFv2 tetravalent antibody (e.g. bispecific C-scFv2 tetravalent antibodies, see for example \nFIG. 46\n). Each heavy chain portion of the scFv2 tetravalent antibody may have variable regions and scFv fragments that bind the same or different target molecules. Where the scFv fragment and variable region of a first heavy chain portion of a bispecific scFc2 tetravalent antibody bind the same target molecule, at least one of the first and second scFv fragments of the second heavy chain portion of the bispecific tetravalent minibody binds a different target molecule.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the multispecific binding molecules of the invention are scFv2 tetravalent domain-deleted antibodies with each heavy chain portion of the scFv2 tetravalent antibody containing an scFv fragment at least one of which is stabilized. The scFv fragments may be linked to the N-termini of a variable region of the heavy chain portions (e.g. bispecific N\nH \nscFv2 tetravalent domain-deleted antibodies (see \nFIG. 48\n) or bispecific N\nL \nscFv2 tetravalent antibodies (see \nFIG. 49\n). Alternatively, the scFv fragments may be linked to the C-termini of the heavy chain portions of the scFv2 tetravalent domain-deleted antibody (e.g. bispecific C-scFv2 tetravalent domain deleted antibodies, see for example \nFIG. 47\n).\n\n\nExemplary cell-surface molecules to which a binding molecule of the invention may bind include receptors or tumor cell antigens that are overexpressed on the surface of a tumor or neoplastic cell, as well as any of the cytokine receptors, adhesion molecules, or growth factor receptors described in herein, e.g. section B supra. Exemplary soluble molecules include anti-tumor agents (e.g. toxins, chemotherapeutics, and prodrugs thereof), soluble enzymes (e.g. prodrug converting enzymes), cytokines, chemokines, hormones, growth factors, or clotting factors, e.g., as described herein, e.g. in section A supra.\n\n\nBispecific molecules which bind to both tumor cell antigens and anti-tumor agents or soluble enzymes can therefore localize the anti-cancer agent to a tumor cell expressing said tumor cell antigen, thereby maximizing the toxic effects of the anti-cancer agent on a tumor cell and minimizing a toxic effect of the anti-cancer agent on normal cells.\n\n\nExemplary bispecific binding molecules with at least one binding site for a tumor antigen and at least one binding site for a toxin include anti-saporin/anti-Id-1, anti-CD22/anti-saporin, anti-CD7/anti-saporin, anti-CD38/anti-saporin, anti-CEA/anti-ricin A chain, anti-interferon-.alpha.(IFN-.alpha.)/anti-hybridoma idiotype, anti-CEA/anti-vinca alkaloid). Exemplary bispecific binding molecules with at least one binding site for a cell-surface molecule and at least one binding site for a prodrug converting enzyme include for example, anti-CD30/anti-alkaline phosphatase (which catalyzes conversion of mitomycin phosphate prodrug to the chemotherapeutic mitomycin alcohol).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the bispecific binding molecules bind to both tumor cell antigens and diagnostic agents, thereby localizing said diagnostic agent to a tumor cell expressing said tumor cell antigen and facilitating tumor detection in vitro or in vivo. Exemplary bispecific binding molecules include anti-CEA/anti-EOTUBE, anti-CEA/anti-DPTA, anti-CEA/anti-.beta.-galactosidase, and anti-p185HER2/anti-1-hapten).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, bispecific binding molecules of the invention bind to both soluble molecules (e.g. soluble antigens) and cell surface molecules on non-tumor cells (e.g. immune cells). For example, can be used to target soluble immune complexes to cell surface receptors on immune cells, thereby facilitating their clearance from the body by cell-mediated immune mechanisms. Exemplary bispecific molecules of this type include anti-low density lipoprotein (LDL)/anti-Fc receptor (e.g. Fc.gamma.RI, Fc.gamma.RII or Fc.gamma.RIII)) and bispecific binding molecules for use in therapy of infectious diseases (such as anti-CD3/anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV), anti-T-cell receptor:CD3 complex/anti-influenza, anti-Fc.gamma.R/anti-HIV.\n\n\nIn other embodiments, bispecific binding molecules of the invention are capable of binding to both cell surface receptors and soluble ligands thereof. In one embodiment, the ligand is the cognate ligand of a TNF family receptor.\n\n\nExemplary cell surface receptors to which the bispecific binding molecules can bind are tumor cell antigens or immune cell receptors. Exemplary cell surface receptors also include cytokine receptors, adhesion molecules, or growth factor receptors, e.g., as described in herein, e.g. in section B supra. Exemplary soluble ligands include cytokines, chemokines, hormones, growth factors, or clotting factors, e.g., as described in section B supra.\n\n\nExemplary bispecific binding molecules include anti-VLA4/anti-Mac-1, anti-VLA4/anti-VEGF, anti-VLA4/anti-angiopoietin, anti-VLA4/anti-TNFα, anti-IGFR1/anti-VEGF, anti-IGFR1/anti-angiopoietin, anti-IGFR1/anti-EGFR, anti-HGF-SF/anti-VEGF, anti-HGF-SF/anti-angiopoietin, and HGF-SF/any second antigen (See, e.g., Cao et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001. 98:7443; Lu et al. 2004. J. Biol. Chem. 279:2856).\n\n\nIn other embodiments, the bispecific binding molecules of the invention include those with at least one arm (ie. binding site) directed against a first soluble molecule (e.g. soluble ligand), and at least one arm directed against a second soluble molecule (e.g. soluble ligand). Such bispecific binding molecules can be employed as diagnostic tools (e.g. anti-rabbit IgG/anti-ferritin, anti-horse radish peroxidase (HRP)/anti-hormone, anti-somatostatin/anti-substance P, anti-HRP/anti-FITC (see Nolan et al., supra)) or fibrinolytic agents (e.g. anti-fibrin/anti-tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), anti-fibrin/anti-urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)).\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the soluble molecule to which a bispecific binding molecule of the invention binds is a soluble ligand of the TNF family. Examples of TNF family ligands include, but are not limited to, LTA (which binds TNFR1/TNFRSF1A), TNF (which binds CD120b/TNFRSF1B), LTB (which binds LTBR/TNFRSF3), OX40L (which binds OX40/TNFRSF4), CD40L (which binds CD40/TNFRSF5), (which binds Fas/TNFRSF6 and DcR3/TNFRSF6B), CD27L (which binds CD27/TNFRSF7), CD30L (which binds CD30/TNFRSF8), 4-1-BB-L (which binds 4-1-BB/TNFRSF9), TRAIL (which binds TRAIL-R1/TNFRSF10A, TRAIL-R2/TNFRSF10B, TRAIL-R3/TNFRSF10C., and TRAIL-R4/TNFRSF10D), RANKL (which binds RANK/TNFRSF11A and Osteoprotegrin/TNFRSF11B), APO-3L (which binds APO-3/TNFRSF12 and DR3L/TNFRSF12L), APRIL (which binds TACI/TNFRSF13B), BAFF (which binds BAFFR/TNFRSF13A), LIGHT (which binds HVEM/TNFRSF14), NGF ligands (which bind LNGFR, e.g. NGF-β, NGF-2/NTF3, NTF5, BDNF, IFRD1), GITRL (which binds GITR/TNFRSF18), EDAR1 & XEDAR ligand, Fn14 ligand, and Troy/Trade ligand.\n\n\nIn other exemplary embodiments, the bispecific binding molecules of the invention have at least one binding site for a first cell-surface molecule and at least one binding site for a second cell-surface molecule. In one embodiment, the first and second cell-surface molecules are located on different cells (e.g. different cell types). For example, bispecific molecules may have at least one arm directed against a tumor cell antigen and at least one arm directed against cell-surface receptor on a non-tumor cell (e.g. an immune cell). Exemplary bispecific binding molecules of this type include those having at least one binding site for a tumor cell antigen and at least one binding site directed against a cytotoxic trigger molecule of an immune effector cell (such as anti-Fc.gamma.RI/anti-CD15, anti-p185.sup.HER2/Fc.garnma.RIII (CD16), anti-p185.sup.HER2/anti-VEGF, anti-CD3/anti-malignant B-cell (1D10), anti-CD3/anti-p185.sup.HER2, anti-CD3/anti-p97, anti-CD3/anti-renal cell carcinoma, anti-CD3/anti-OVCAR-3, anti-CD3/L-D1 (anti-colon carcinoma), anti-CD3/anti-melanocyte stimulating hormone analog, anti-EGF receptor/anti-CD3, anti-CD3/anti-CAMA1, anti-CD3/anti-CD19, anti-CD3/MoV18, anti-neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)/anti-CD3, anti-folate binding protein (FBP)/anti-CD3, and anti-pan carcinoma associated antigen (AMOC-31)/anti-CD3)). Bispecific molecules which bind to both tumor cell antigens and cytotoxic trigger molecule are capable of effectively juxtaposing a tumor cell with an immune effector cell, thereby activating the effector cell to destroy the tumor cell by cell-mediated immune mechanisms.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the first and second cell-surface molecules to which a bispecific binding molecule is capable of binding are located on the same cell or cell type. By crosslinking the first and second receptors on the same cell, the bispecific binding molecules of the invention may inhibit or enhance an activity (e.g. signal transduction activity) associated with one or both of the first and second receptors. In one embodiment the first and second cell surface molecules are of the same type (e.g., are in the same family of molecules). In another embodiment said first and second cell surface molecules are distinct types (e.g., are in different families of molecules). Exemplary cell surface receptors to which the bispecific binding molecules bind include tumor cell antigens or immune cell receptors. Exemplary cell surface receptors include any of the cytokine receptors, adhesion molecules, or growth factor receptors described in section B supra.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, exemplary target molecules to which a binding molecule of the invention binds include one or more epitopes of e.g., heparin sulfate, growth factors or their receptors (.e.g, epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor receptor, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF/SF) receptor (See, e.g., Cao et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001. 98:7443; Lu et al. 2004. J. Biol. Chem. 279:2856).\n\n\nIn an exemplary embodiment, at least one of the molecules to which a bispecific binding molecule of the invention binds is a member of the TNF receptor (TNFR) family. In another exemplary embodiment, the first and second target molecules to which a bispecific binding molecule of the invention binds are both TNFR family members. In another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention binds to a TNFR family ligand. In yet another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention binds to one TNFR family member and an antigen expressed on the surface of a tumor cell, e.g., preferentially expressed on a tumor cell. The limiting factor in the treatment of tumors with monospecific TNFR binding molecules is that often only a subset of tumors appears to be sensitive to such therapies. Multispecific TNFR binding molecules can specifically activate TNFRs, and enhance receptor signaling by, for example, bringing the TNFRs into close proximity. The invention provides improved bispecific TNFR binding molecules which can target more than one TNFR or TNFR type and enhance signaling, thus providing an improved method of treating cancer. In one embodiment, the bispecific TNFR binding molecule increases the signal strength by binding to two or more TNFRs of the same type increasing the number of TNFRs being brought together. In another more preferred embodiment, the bispecific TNFR binding molecule is capable of binding to two different receptors of the TNF family.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, at least one of the TNFRs to which a bispecific TNFR binding molecule binds contains a death domain. The term “death domain” refers to a cytoplasmic region of a TNF family receptor which is involved TNF-mediated cell death or apoptotic signaling and cell-cytotoxicity induction mediated by these receptors. This region couples the receptor to caspase activation via adaptor proteins resulting in activation of the extrinsic death pathway.\n\n\nExamples of TNF receptors which contain death domains include, but are not limited to, TNFR1 (TNFRSF1A), Fas (TNFRSF6), DR-3 (TNFRSF6B), LNGFR (TNFRSF16) TRAIL-R1 (TNFRSF10A), TRAIL-R2 (TNFRSF10B) and DR6 (TNFRSF21). The apoptotic signaling of these receptors is modulated upon binding of a cognate ligand and formation of any of the following receptor-ligand pairs: TNFR1/TNFα, Fas/FasL, DR-3/DR-3LG, TRAIL-R1/TRAIL, or TRAIL-R2/TRAIL.\n\n\nBispecific TNFR binding molecules that target TNF family receptors containing death domains are useful for the treatment of cancer since the TNFRs of this type are often overexpressed on tumor cells and stimulating of the receptor can activate tumor cell apoptosis. In preferred embodiments, the death-domain containing TNFR to which the bispecific TNFR binding molecule of the invention binds is TRAIL-R2. TRAIL-R2 is preferred for human tumor therapy since its activation does not trigger hepatocyte apoptosis and hence should have reduced toxicity.\n\n\nWhile the activation of some of death domain containing receptors, e.g. TNFR1 or Fas, has been toxic in in vivo applications, it is likely that tethering these receptors to other TNF receptors may diminish toxicity and thus render a toxic antibody less toxic.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a bispecific TNFR binding molecule of the invention comprises at least one binding site directed to a TNFR containing a death domain and at least one binding site directed to a TNFR lacking a death domain.\n\n\nIn certain exemplary embodiments, TNFRs lacking a death domain include TNFRs involved in tissue differentiation. Examples of TNFR receptors involved in tissue differentiation include LTβR, RANK, EDAR1, XEDAR, Fn14, Troy/Trade, and NGFR. TNFRs involved in tissue differentiation may influence tissue differentiation following binding of a cognate ligand. TNFR binding molecules that target TNFRs involved in tissue differentiation can affect tumors in several ways. First, they have the potential to directly slow tumor growth by altering cell cycle progression. Second, tissue differentiation in the context of tumor cell transformation may lead to cell cycle conflict and default apoptosis. Third, such conflicting input may render a cell more sensitive to chemotherapy.\n\n\nIn certain preferred embodiments, TNFR involved in tissue differentiation is lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR). LTβR is involved in the control of the maturation status of various specialized stromal cells in the immune system and plays a critical role during the development of the stromal elements of the lymph node anlagen. It has been proposed that activation of a developmental program in epithelial or fibroblastoid cells in the context of a transformed cell is detrimental to their survival and this action may account for some of the anti-tumor activity of LTβR activation. These receptors can also initiate inflammatory programs that involve chemokine release or promote immunological anti-tumor responses. Such release could affect the inflammatory status of the tumor and/or invoke infiltration of lymphoid elements promoting an immunological reaction to the tumor. Thus, bispecific TNFR binding molecules which bind LTβR, alone or in combination with TNF receptors containing death domains (e.g. TRAIL-R2), are encompassed by the invention.\n\n\nIn certain exemplary embodiments, the TNFRs lacking a death domain include TNFRs involved in immune regulation. Such receptors include TNFR2, HVEM, CD27, CD30, CD40, 4-1BB, OX40, GITR, TACI, BAFF-R, BCMA, and RELT. Additional TNF family receptors involved in immune regulation include TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4.\n\n\nOther target TNF family receptors with a role in tumor formation can be identified using existing RNA databases of receptor expression in various cell types which allow one to define TNF family receptors that are present or ideally overexpressed on various tumors. Moreover, existing RNA databases provide an additional advantage in that the pair of TNF family receptors to which a bispecific TNFR binding molecule of the invention binds could be optimized by identifying those receptor pairs that are more uniquely expressed on a tumor type or subset of tumors but are not abundant on normal tissues, especially liver and vasculature. In such a manner receptor pairs (or more) are identified that could deliver a potent signal to the tumor and spare normal tissues.\n\n\nMethods of producing multispecific molecules are well known in the art. For example, recombinant technology can be used to produce multispecific molecules, e.g., diabodies, single-chain diabodies, tandem scFvs, etc. Exemplary techniques for producing multispecific molecules are known in the art (e.g., Kontermann et al. Methods in Molecular Biology Vol. 248: Antibody Engineering: Methods and Protocols. Pp 227-242 US 2003/0207346 A1 and the references cited therein). In one embodiment, a multimeric multispecific molecules are prepared using methods such as those described e.g., in US 2003/0207346 A1 or U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,333, or US2004/0058400.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a multispecific binding molecule of the invention is a multispecific fusion protein. As used herein the phrase “multispecific fusion protein” designates fusion proteins (as hereinabove defined) having at least two binding specificities (i.e. combining a binding domains of a ligand or receptor). Multispecific fusion proteins can be assembled, e.g., as heterodimers, heterotrimers or heterotetramers, essentially as disclosed in WO 89/02922 (published Apr. 6, 1989), in EP 314, 317 (published May 3, 1989), and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,116,964 issued May 2, 1992. Preferred multispecific fusion proteins are bispecific. Examples of bispecific fusion proteins include CD4-scFv/TNF receptor-IgG and CD4-scFv/L-selectin-IgG. The last mentioned molecule combines the lymph node binding function of the lymphocyte homing receptor (LHR, L-selectin), and the HIV binding function of CD4, and finds potential application in the prevention or treatment of HIV infection, related conditions, or as a diagnostic.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention pertains to multispecific stabilized binding molecules, e.g., bispecific binding molecules, e.g., antibodies, which incorporate at least one binding site that binds to a known target and at least one binding site which recognizes an unknown target (for example, in one embodiment, the bispecific molecule incorporates binding sites selected from a semi-synthetic antibody phage display library) and a stabilized scFv of the invention.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, one of ordinary skill in the art could start with a single chain antibody of known specificity and build a Fab library using techniques known in the art or, alternatively, the skilled artisan could start with an Fab fragment of known specificity and build a stabilized single chain library using techniques known in the art. It is known in the art that libraries from nonimmunized sources and prepared by synthetic recombination of V-gene sequences (preferably recombination of VH with, DH and JH, and VL with JL sequences) can be used to isolate antibodies to any antigen. For example, patent application WO92/01047 teaches that antibody fragments can be displayed on the surface of bacteriophage and that they will bind antigen. Antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, Fv, scFv and VH) can be directly selected using this characteristic. Other methods known in the art include those taught, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,698,426; 6,291,159; 5,658,727; 5,667,988; and 5,969,108.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, scFv which recognize a known target can be dimerized with scFv isolated from a semi-synthetic human phage antibody display library. (see, e.g., Kruif and Logtenberg 1996. J. Biol. Chem. 271:7630).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the subject multispecific molecule is expressed in an expression system used to express antibody molecules, for example mammalian cells, yeast such as \nPichia, E. coli\n, Bacculovirus, etc. In one embodiment, the subject bispecific molecule is expressed in the NEOSPLA vector system (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,159,730). This vector contains the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer, the mouse beta globin major promoter, the SV40 origin of replication, the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence, \nneomycin phosphotransferase exon\n 1 and \nexon\n 2, the dihydrofolate reductase gene and leader sequence.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the subject multispecific molecules comprise a synthetic connecting peptide.\n\n\nThese multispecific molecules have one or more binding sites for a known target and express a library at one or more binding sites. Such multispecific molecules can be used, e.g., to identify molecules in close proximity to or associated with the known target. For example, the skilled artisan could use the subject multispecific molecules in an assay to select for those that induce a particular response, e.g., apoptosis or cellular activation, using screening methods well known in the art. The bispecific molecule identified as producing the response screened for can then be identified and its specificity determined. Using such methods it is possible to identify molecules in close association with particular targets of interest, e.g., T cell markers or other signaling molecules (such as CRIPTO-I, death domain molecules, or molecules involved in apoptosis). The proximity of the known target and the molecule newly identified as a “nearest neighbor” can be confirmed using immunoprecipitation or other techniques known to those of skill in the art. Using these methods it is possible to identify molecules as targets for modulating a particular cellular response.\n\n\nBinding specificities comprising antigen recognition sites or entire variable regions of multi specific binding molecule, in particular multispecific antibodies or antibody variants of the invention may be derived from one or more parental antibodies. The parental antibodies can include naturally occurring antibodies or antibody fragments, antibodies or antibody fragments adapted from naturally occurring antibodies, antibodies constructed de novo using sequences of antibodies or antibody fragments known to be specific a target molecule. Sequences that may be derived from parental antibodies include heavy and/or light chain variable regions and/or CDRs, framework regions or other portions thereof.\n\n\nIn one exemplary embodiment of the invention, the parental antibodies used to construct a multispecific TNFR binding molecule are an anti-TRAIL-R2 antibody, for example 14A2, and an anti-LTβR antibody, for example CBE11 or BHA10. Multivalent, multispecific antibodies may contain a heavy chain comprising two or more variable regions and/or a light chain comprising one or more variable regions wherein at least two of the variable regions recognize different epitopes of LTβR.\n\n\nMultispecific, e.g., bispecific TNFR binding molecules may be constructed in a variety different ways using a variety of different sequences derived from parental anti-LTβR antibodies, including murine or humanized BHA10 (Browning et al., \nJ.

Preferably non-human antibodies are “humanized” by linking the non-human antigen binding domain with a human constant domain (e.g. Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 81, pp. 6851-55 (1984)).\n\n\nOther methods which may be used to prepare multivalent antibody constructs are described in the following publications: Ghetie, Maria-Ana et al.

Expression of Binding Molecules\n\n\nFollowing manipulation of the isolated genetic material to provide polypeptides of the invention as set forth above, the genes are typically inserted in an expression vector for introduction into host cells that may be used to produce the desired quantity of polypeptide that, in turn, provides the claimed binding molecules.\n\n\nThe term “vector” or “expression vector” is used herein for the purposes of the specification and claims, to mean vectors used in accordance with the present invention as a vehicle for introducing into and expressing a desired gene in a cell. As known to those skilled in the art, such vectors may easily be selected from the group consisting of plasmids, phages, viruses and retroviruses. In general, vectors compatible with the instant invention will comprise a selection marker, appropriate restriction sites to facilitate cloning of the desired gene and the ability to enter and/or replicate in eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells.\n\n\nFor the purposes of this invention, numerous expression vector systems may be employed. For example, one class of vector utilizes DNA elements which are derived from animal viruses such as bovine papilloma virus, polyoma virus, adenovirus, vaccinia virus, baculovirus, retroviruses (RSV, MMTV or MOMLV) or SV40 virus. Others involve the use of polycistronic systems with internal ribosome binding sites. Additionally, cells which have integrated the DNA into their chromosomes may be selected by introducing one or more markers which allow selection of transfected host cells. The marker may provide for prototrophy to an auxotrophic host, biocide resistance (e.g., antibiotics) or resistance to heavy metals such as copper. The selectable marker gene can either be directly linked to the DNA sequences to be expressed, or introduced into the same cell by cotransformation. Additional elements may also be needed for optimal synthesis of mRNA. These elements may include signal sequences, splice signals, as well as transcriptional promoters, enhancers, and termination signals. In particularly preferred embodiments the cloned variable region genes are inserted into an expression vector along with the heavy and light chain constant region genes (preferably human) synthetic as discussed above. Preferably, this is effected using a proprietary expression vector of IDEC, Inc., referred to as NEOSPLA (U.S. Pat. No. 6,159,730). This vector contains the cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer, the mouse beta globin major promoter, the SV40 origin of replication, the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence, \nneomycin phosphotransferase exon\n 1 and \nexon\n 2, the dihydrofolate reductase gene and leader sequence. As seen in the examples below, this vector has been found to result in very high level expression of antibodies upon incorporation of variable and constant region genes, transfection in CHO cells, followed by selection in G418 containing medium and methotrexate amplification. Vector systems are also taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,736,137 and 5,658,570, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. This system provides for high expression levels, e.g., >30 pg/cell/day. Other exemplary vector systems are disclosed e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,413,777.\n\n\nIn other preferred embodiments the polypeptides of the invention of the instant invention may be expressed using polycistronic constructs such as those disclosed in copending U.S. provisional application No. 60/331,481 filed Nov. 16, 2001 and incorporated herein in its entirety. In these novel expression systems, multiple gene products of interest such as heavy and light chains of antibodies may be produced from a single polycistronic construct. These systems advantageously use an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) to provide relatively high levels of polypeptides of the invention in eukaryotic host cells. Compatible IRES sequences are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,193,980 which is also incorporated herein. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that such expression systems may be used to effectively produce the full range of polypeptides disclosed in the instant application.\n\n\nMore generally, once the vector or DNA sequence encoding a monomeric subunit of the binding molecule (e.g. a modified antibody) has been prepared, the expression vector may be introduced into an appropriate host cell. That is, the host cells may be transformed. Introduction of the plasmid into the host cell can be accomplished by various techniques well known to those of skill in the art. These include, but are not limited to, transfection (including electrophoresis and electroporation), protoplast fusion, calcium phosphate precipitation, cell fusion with enveloped DNA, microinjection, and infection with intact virus. See, Ridgway, A. A. G. “\nMammalian Expression Vectors\n” Chapter 24.2, pp. 470-472 Vectors, Rodriguez and Denhardt, Eds. (Butterworths, Boston, Mass. 1988). Most preferably, plasmid introduction into the host is via electroporation. The transformed cells are grown under conditions appropriate to the production of the light chains and heavy chains, and assayed for heavy and/or light chain protein synthesis. Exemplary assay techniques include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), or flourescence-activated cell sorter analysis (FACS), immunohistochemistry and the like.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “transformation” shall be used in a broad sense to refer to the introduction of DNA into a recipient host cell that changes the genotype and consequently results in a change in the recipient cell.\n\n\nAlong those same lines, “host cells” refers to cells that have been transformed with vectors constructed using recombinant DNA techniques and encoding at least one heterologous gene. In descriptions of processes for isolation of polypeptides from recombinant hosts, the terms “cell” and “cell culture” are used interchangeably to denote the source of antibody unless it is clearly specified otherwise. In other words, recovery of polypeptide from the “cells” may mean either from spun down whole cells, or from the cell culture containing both the medium and the suspended cells.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the host cell line used for protein expression (e.g., of multivalent binding molecules) is of mammalian origin; those skilled in the art are credited with ability to preferentially determine particular host cell lines which are best suited for the desired gene product to be expressed therein. Exemplary host cell lines include, but are not limited to, DG44 and DUXB11 (Chinese Hamster Ovary lines, DHFR minus), HELA (human cervical carcinoma), CVI (monkey kidney line), COS (a derivative of CVI with SV40 T antigen), R1610 (Chinese hamster fibroblast) BALBC/3T3 (mouse fibroblast), HAK (hamster kidney line), SP2/O (mouse myeloma), P3.times.63-Ag3.653 (mouse myeloma), BFA-1c1BPT (bovine endothelial cells), RAJI (human lymphocyte) and 293 (human kidney). In one embodiment NS0 cells may be used. CHO cells are particularly preferred. Host cell lines are typically available from commercial services, the American Tissue Culture Collection or from published literature.\n\n\nIn vitro production allows scale-up to give large amounts of the desired polypeptides. Techniques for mammalian cell cultivation under tissue culture conditions are known in the art and include homogeneous suspension culture, e.g. in an airlift reactor or in a continuous stirrer reactor, or immobilized or entrapped cell culture, e.g. in hollow fibers, microcapsules, on agarose microbeads or ceramic cartridges. If necessary and/or desired, the solutions of polypeptides can be purified by the customary chromatography methods, for example gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, chromatography over DEAE-cellulose or (immuno-)affinity chromatography, e.g., after preferential biosynthesis of a synthetic hinge region polypeptide or prior to or subsequent to the HIC chromatography step described herein.\n\n\nGenes encoding the polypeptide of the invention can also be expressed non-mammalian cells such as bacteria or yeast or plant cells. In this regard it will be appreciated that various unicellular non-mammalian microorganisms such as bacteria can also be transformed; i.e. those capable of being grown in cultures or fermentation. Bacteria, which are susceptible to transformation, include members of the enterobacteriaceae, such as strains of \nEscherichia coli \nor \nSalmonella\n; Bacillaceae, such as \nBacillus subtilis; Pneumococcus; Streptococcus\n, and \nHaemophilus influenzae\n. It will further be appreciated that, when expressed in bacteria, the polypeptides typically become part of inclusion bodies. The polypeptides must be isolated, purified and then assembled into functional molecules. Where tetravalent forms of antibodies are desired, the subunits will then self-assemble into tetravalent antibodies (WO02/096948A2).\n\n\nIn addition to prokaryates, eukaryotic microbes may also be used. \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n, or common baker's yeast, is the most commonly used among eukaryotic microorganisms although a number of other strains are commonly available. For expression in \nSaccharomyces\n, the plasmid YRp7, for example, (Stinchcomb et al., Nature, 282:39 (1979); Kingsman et al., Gene, 7:141 (1979); Tschemper et al., Gene, 10:157 (1980)) is commonly used. This plasmid already contains the TRP1 gene which provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1 (Jones, Genetics, 85:12 (1977)). The presence of the trpl lesion as a characteristic of the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan.\n\n\nXII. Labeling or Conjugation of Binding Molecules\n\n\nThe binding molecules of the present invention may be used in non-conjugated form or may be conjugated to at least one of a variety of effector, i.e., functional, molecules, e.g., to facilitate target detection or for imaging or therapy of the patient. The polypeptides of the invention can be labeled or conjugated either before or after purification, when purification is performed. In particular, the polypeptides of the present invention may be conjugated to cytotoxins (such as radioisotopes, cytotoxic drugs, or toxins) therapeutic agents, cytostatic agents, biological toxins, prodrugs, peptides, proteins, enzymes, viruses, lipids, biological response modifiers, pharmaceutical agents, immunologically active ligands (e.g., lymphokines or other antibodies wherein the resulting molecule binds to both the neoplastic cell and an effector cell such as a T cell), PEG, or detectable molecules useful in imaging. In another embodiment, a polypeptide of the invention can be conjugated to a molecule that decreases vascularization of tumors. In other embodiments, the disclosed compositions may comprise polypeptides of the invention coupled to drugs or prodrugs. Still other embodiments of the present invention comprise the use of polypeptides of the invention conjugated to specific biotoxins or their cytotoxic fragments such as ricin, gelonin, pseudomonas exotoxin or diphtheria toxin. The selection of which conjugated or unconjugated polypeptide to use will depend on the type and stage of cancer, use of adjunct treatment (e.g., chemotherapy or external radiation) and patient condition. It will be appreciated that one skilled in the art could readily make such a selection in view of the teachings herein.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that, in previous studies, anti-tumor antibodies labeled with isotopes have been used successfully to destroy cells in solid tumors as well as lymphomas/leukemias in animal models, and in some cases in humans. Exemplary radioisotopes include: \n90\nY, \n125\nI, \n131\nI, \n123\nI, \n111\nIn, \n105\nRh, \n153\nSm, \n67\nCU, \n67\nGa, \n166\nHo, \n177\nLu, \n186\nRe and \n188\nRe. The radionuclides act by producing ionizing radiation which causes multiple strand breaks in nuclear DNA, leading to cell death. The isotopes used to produce therapeutic conjugates typically produce high energy α- or β-particles which have a short path length. Such radionuclides kill cells to which they are in close proximity, for example neoplastic cells to which the conjugate has attached or has entered. They have little or no effect on non-localized cells. Radionuclides are essentially non-immunogenic.\n\n\nWith respect to the use of radiolabeled conjugates in conjunction with the present invention, polypeptides of the invention may be directly labeled (such as through iodination) or may be labeled indirectly through the use of a chelating agent. As used herein, the phrases “indirect labeling” and “indirect labeling approach” both mean that a chelating agent is covalently attached to a binding molecule and at least one radionuclide is associated with the chelating agent. Such chelating agents are typically referred to as bifunctional chelating agents as they bind both the polypeptide and the radioisotope. Particularly preferred chelating agents comprise 1-isothiocycmatobenzyl-3-methyldiothelene triaminepentaacetic acid (“MX-DTPA”) and cyclohexyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (“CHX-DTPA”) derivatives. Other chelating agents comprise P-DOTA and EDTA derivatives. Particularly preferred radionuclides for indirect labeling include \n111\nIn and \n90\nY.\n\n\nAs used herein, the phrases “direct labeling” and “direct labeling approach” both mean that a radionuclide is covalently attached directly to a polypeptide (typically via an amino acid residue). More specifically, these linking technologies include random labeling and site-directed labeling. In the latter case, the labeling is directed at specific sites on the polypeptide, such as the N-linked sugar residues present only on the Fc portion of the conjugates. Further, various direct labeling techniques and protocols are compatible with the instant invention. For example, Technetium-99m labeled polypeptides may be prepared by ligand exchange processes, by reducing pertechnate (TcO\n4\n \n−\n) with stannous ion solution, chelating the reduced technetium onto a Sephadex column and applying the polypeptides to this column, or by batch labeling techniques, e.g. by incubating pertechnate, a reducing agent such as SnCl\n2\n, a buffer solution such as a sodium-potassium phthalate-solution, and the antibodies. In any event, preferred radionuclides for directly labeling antibodies are well known in the art and a particularly preferred radionuclide for direct labeling is \n131\nI covalently attached via tyrosine residues. Polypeptides according to the invention may be derived, for example, with radioactive sodium or potassium iodide and a chemical oxidizing agent, such as sodium hypochlorite, chloramine T or the like, or an enzymatic oxidizing agent, such as lactoperoxidase, glucose oxidase and glucose. However, for the purposes of the present invention, the indirect labeling approach is particularly preferred.\n\n\nPatents relating to chelators and chelator conjugates are known in the art. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 4,831,175 of Gansow is directed to polysubstituted diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid chelates and protein conjugates containing the same, and methods for their preparation. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,099,069, 5,246,692, 5,286,850, 5,434,287 and 5,124,471 of Gansow also relate to polysubstituted DTPA chelates. These patents are incorporated herein in their entirety. Other examples of compatible metal chelators are ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DPTA), 1,4,8,11-tetraazatetradecane, 1,4,8,11-tetraazatetradecane-1,4,8,11-tetraacetic acid, 1-oxa-4,7,12,15-tetraazaheptadecane-4,7,12,15-tetraacetic acid, or the like. Cyclohexyl-DTPA or CHX-DTPA is particularly preferred and is exemplified extensively below. Still other compatible chelators, including those yet to be discovered, may easily be discerned by a skilled artisan and are clearly within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nCompatible chelators, including the specific bifunctional chelator used to facilitate chelation in co-pending application Ser. Nos. 08/475,813, 08/475,815 and 08/478,967, are preferably selected to provide high affinity for trivalent metals, exhibit increased tumor-to-non-tumor ratios and decreased bone uptake as well as greater in vivo retention of radionuclide at target sites, i.e., B-cell lymphoma tumor sites. However, other bifunctional chelators that may or may not possess all of these characteristics are known in the art and may also be beneficial in tumor therapy.\n\n\nIt will also be appreciated that, in accordance with the teachings herein, polypeptides may be conjugated to different radiolabels for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. To this end the aforementioned co-pending applications, herein incorporated by reference in their entirety, disclose radiolabeled therapeutic conjugates for diagnostic “imaging” of tumors before administration of therapeutic antibody. “In2B8” conjugate comprises a murine monoclonal antibody, 2B8, specific to human CD20 antigen, that is attached to \n111\nIn via a bifunctional chelator, i.e., MX-DTPA (diethylene-triaminepentaacetic acid), which comprises a 1:1 mixture of 1-isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyl-DTPA and 1-methyl-3-isothiocyanatobenzyl-DTPA. \n111\nIn is particularly preferred as a diagnostic radionuclide because between about 1 to about 10 mCi can be safely administered without detectable toxicity; and the imaging data is generally predictive of subsequent \n90\nY-labeled antibody distribution. Most imaging studies utilize 5 mCi \n111\nIn-labeled antibody, because this dose is both safe and has increased imaging efficiency compared with lower doses, with optimal imaging occurring at three to six days after antibody administration. See, for example, Murray, \nJ. Nuc. Med. \n26: 3328 (1985) and Carraguillo et al., \nJ. Nuc. Med. \n26: 67 (1985).\n\n\nAs indicated above, a variety of radionuclides are applicable to the present invention and those skilled in the art can readily determine which radionuclide is most appropriate under various circumstances. For example, \n131\nI is a well known radionuclide used for targeted immunotherapy. However, the clinical usefulness of \n131\nI can be limited by several factors including: eight-day physical half-life; dehalogenation of iodinated antibody both in the blood and at tumor sites; and emission characteristics (e.g., large gamma component) which can be suboptimal for localized dose deposition in tumor. With the advent of superior chelating agents, the opportunity for attaching metal chelating groups to proteins has increased the opportunities to utilize other radionuclides such as \n111\nIn and \n90\nY. \n90\nY provides several benefits for utilization in radioimmunotherapeutic applications: the 64 hour half-life of \n90\nY is long enough to allow antibody accumulation by tumor and, unlike e.g., \n131\nI, \n90\nY is a pure beta emitter of high energy with no accompanying gamma irradiation in its decay, with a range in tissue of 100 to 1,000 cell diameters. Furthermore, the minimal amount of penetrating radiation allows for outpatient administration of \n90\nY-labeled antibodies. Additionally, internalization of labeled antibody is not required for cell killing, and the local emission of ionizing radiation should be lethal for adjacent tumor cells lacking the target molecule.\n\n\nThose skilled in the art will appreciate that these non-radioactive conjugates may also be assembled using a variety of techniques depending on the selected agent to be conjugated. For example, conjugates with biotin are prepared e.g. by reacting the polypeptides with an activated ester of biotin such as the biotin N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. Similarly, conjugates with a fluorescent marker may be prepared in the presence of a coupling agent, e.g. those listed above, or by reaction with an isothiocyanate, preferably fluorescein-isothiocyanate. Conjugates of the polypeptides of the invention with cytostatic/cytotoxic substances and metal chelates are prepared in an analogous manner.\n\n\nMany effector molecules lack suitable functional groups to which antibodies can be linked. In one embodiment, an effector molecule, e.g., a drug or prodrug is attached to the antibody through a linking molecule. In one embodiment, the linking molecule contains a chemical bond that allows for the activation of cytotoxicity at a particular site. Suitable chemical bonds are well known in the art and include disulfide bonds, acid labile bonds, photolabile bonds, peptidase labile bonds, thioether bonds formed between sulfhydryl and maleimide groups, and esterase labile bonds. Most preferably, the linking molecule comprises a disulfide bond or a thioether bond. In accordance with the invention, the linking molecule preferably comprises a reactive chemical group. Particularly preferred reactive chemical groups are N-succinimidyl esters and N-sulfosuccinimidyl esters. In a preferred embodiment, the reactive chemical group can be covalently bound to the effector via disulfide bonding between thiol groups. In one embodiment an effector molecule is modified to comprise a thiol group. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that a thiol group contains a sulfur atom bonded to a hydrogen atom and is typically also referred to in the art as a sulfhydryl group, which can be denoted as “—SH” or “RSH.”\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a linking molecule may be used to join the effector molecule with the binding molecule. The linking molecule of the invention may be cleavable or non-cleavable. In one embodiment, the cleavable linking molecule is a redox-cleavable linking molecule, such that the linking molecule is cleavable in environments with a lower redox potential, such as the cytoplasm and other regions with higher concentrations of molecules with free sulfhydryl groups. Examples of linking molecules that may be cleaved due to a change in redox potential include those containing disulfides. The cleaving stimulus can be provided upon intracellular uptake of the binding protein of the invention where the lower redox potential of the cytoplasm facilitates cleavage of the linking molecule. In another embodiment, a decrease in pH triggers the release of the maytansinoid cargo into the target cell. The decrease in pH is implicated in many physiological and pathological processes, such as endosome trafficking, tumor growth, inflammation, and myocardial ischemia. The pH drops from a physiological 7.4 to 5-6 in endosomes or 4-5 in lysosomes. Examples of acid sensitive linking molecules which may be used to target lysosomes or endosomes of cancer cells, include those with acid-cleavable bonds such as those found in acetals, ketals, orthoesters, hydrazones, trityls, cis-aconityls, or thiocarbamoyls (see for example, Willner et al., (1993), \nBioconj. Chem., \n4: 521-7; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,569,789, 4,631,190, 5,306,809, and 5,665,358). Other exemplary acid-sensitive linking molecules comprise dipeptide sequences Phe-Lys and Val-Lys (King et al., (2002), \nJ. Med. Chem., \n45: 4336-43). The cleaving stimulus can be provided upon intracellular uptake trafficking to low pH endosomal compartments (e.g. lysosomes). Other exemplary acid-cleavable linking molecules are the molecules that contain two or more acid cleavable bonds for attachment of two or more maytansinoids (King et al., (1999), \nBioconj. Chem., \n10: 279-88; WO 98/19705).\n\n\nCleavable linking molecules may be sensitive to biologically supplied cleaving agents that are associated with a particular target cell, for example, lysosomal or tumor-associated enzymes. Examples of linking molecules that can be cleaved enzymatically include, but are not limited to, peptides and esters. Exemplary enzyme cleavable linking molecules include those that are sensitive to tumor-associated proteases such as Cathepsin B or plasmin (Dubowchik et al., (1999), \nPharm. Ther., \n83: 67-123; Dubowchik et al., (1998), \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., \n8: 3341-52; de Groot et al., (2000), \nJ. Med. Chem., \n43: 3093-102; de Groot et al., (1999)m 42: 5277-83). Cathepsin B-cleavable sites include the dipeptide sequences valine-citrulline and phenylalanine-lysine (Doronina et al., (2003), \nNat. Biotech., \n21(7): 778-84); Dubowchik et al., (2002), \nBioconjug. Chem., \n13: 855-69). Other exemplary enzyme-cleavable sites include those formed by oligopeptide sequences of 4 to 16 amino acids (e.g., Suc-β-Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu (SEQ ID NO: 158)) which recognized by trouse proteases such as Thimet Oliogopeptidase (TOP), an enzyme that is preferentially released by neutrophils, macrophages, and other granulocytes.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the linking molecule is formed by reacting a binding molecule of the invention with a linking molecule of the formula:\n\n\nX-Y-Z\n\n\n\nwherein:\n\n \n \n \n \nX is an attachment molecule;\n \nY is a spacer molecule; and\n \nZ is a effector attachment moeity.\n \n \n \n\n\nThe term “binding molecule attachment molecule” includes molecules which allow for the covalent attachment of the connecting peptide to a binding molecule of the invention.\n\n\nThe attachment molecule may comprise, for example, a covalent chain of 1-60 carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur atoms, optionally substituted with hydrogen atoms and other substituents which allow the binding molecule to perform its intended function. The attachment molecule may comprise peptide, ester, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, ether, thioether, etc. functional groups. Preferably, the attachment molecule is selected such that it is capable of reacting with a reactive functional group on a polypeptide comprising at least one antigen binding site, to form a binding molecule of the invention. Examples of attachment molecules include, for example, amino, carboxylate, and thiol attachment molecules.\n\n\nAmino attachment molecules include molecules which react with amino groups on a polypeptide, such that a binding molecule of the invention is formed. Amino attachment molecules are known in the art. Examples of amino attachment molecules include, activated carbamides (e.g., which may react with an amino group on a binding molecule to form a linking molecule which comprises urea group), aldehydes (e.g., which may react with amino groups on a binding molecule), and activated isocyanates (which may react with an amino group on a binding molecule to from a linking molecule which comprises a urea group). Examples of amino attachment molecules include, but are not limited to, N-succinimidyl, N-sulfosuccinimidyl, N-phthalimidyl, N-sulfophthalimidyl, 2-nitrophenyl, 4-nitrophenyl, 2,4-dinitrophenyl, 3-sulfonyl-4-nitrophenyl, or 3-carboxy-4-nitrophenyl molecule.\n\n\nCarboxylate attachment molecules include molecules which react with carboxylate groups on a polypeptide, such that a binding molecule of the invention is formed. Carboxylate attachment molecules are known in the art. Examples of carboxylate attachment molecules include, but are not limited to activated ester intermediates and activated carbonyl intermediates, which may react with a COOH group on a binding molecule to form a linking molecule which comprises a ester, thioester, or amide group.\n\n\nThiol attachment molecules include molecules which react with thiol groups present on a polypeptide, such that a binding molecule of the invention is formed. Thiol attachment molecules are known in the art. Examples of thiol attachment molecules include activated acyl groups (which may react with a sulfhydryl on a binding molecule to form a linking molecule which comprises a thioester), activated alkyl groups (which may react with a sulfhydryl on a binding molecule to form a linking molecule which comprises a thioester molecule), Michael acceptors such as maleimide or acrylic groups (which may react with a sulfhydryl on a binding molecule to form a Michael-type addition product), groups which react with sulfhydryl groups via redox reactions, activated di-sulfide groups (which may react with a sulfhydryl group on a binding molecule to form, for example, a linking molecule which comprises a disulfide molecule). Other thiol attachment molecules include acrylamides, alpha-iodoacetamides, and cyclopropan-1,1-dicarbonyl compounds. In addition, the thiol attachment molecule may comprise a molecule which modifies a thiol on the binding molecule to form another reactive species to which the linking molecule can be attached to form a binding molecule of the invention.\n\n\nThe spacer molecule, Y, is a covalent bond or a covalent chain of atoms which may contain one or more aminoacid residues. It may also comprise 0-60 carbon, oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen atoms optionally substituted with hydrogen or other substituents which allow the resulting binding molecule to perform its intended function. In one embodiment, Y comprises an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, ester, ether, carbonyl, or amide molecule.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a thiol group on the binding molecule is converted into a reactive group, such as a reactive carbonyl group, such as a ketone or aldehyde. The attachment molecule is then reacted with the ketone or aldehyde to form the desired compound of the invention. Examples of carbonyl reactive attachment molecules include, but are not limited to, hydrazines, hydrazides, O-substituted hydroxylamines, alpha-beta-unsaturated ketones, and H\n2\nC═CH—CO—NH—NH\n2\n. Other examples of attachment molecules and methods for modifying thiol molecules which can be used to form binding molecules of the invention are described Pratt, M. L. et al. J Am Chem. Soc. 2003 May 21; 125(20):6149-59; and Saxon, E. Science. 2000 Mar. 17; 287(5460):2007-10.\n\n\nThe linking molecule may be a molecule which is capable of reacting with an effector molecule or a derivative thereof to form a binding molecule of the invention. For example, the effector molecule may be linked to the remaining portions of the molecule through a disulfide bond. In such cases, the linking molecule is selected such that it is capable of reacting with an appropriate effector moeity derivative such that the effector molecule is attached to the binding molecule of the invention. As described above, the linking molecule and/or the connecting peptide as a whole may be selected that the connecting peptide is cleaved in an appropriate environment.\n\n\nParticularly preferred connecting peptide molecules include, for example, N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP) (see, e.g., Carlsson et al., Biochem. J., 173, 723-737 (1978)), N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)butanoate (SPDB) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,563,304), N-succinimidyl 4-(2-pyridyldithio)pentanoate (SPP) (see, e.g., CAS Registry number 341498-08-6), N-succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) (see, e.g., Yoshitake et al., Eur. J. Biochem., 101, 395-399 (1979)), and N-succinimidyl 4-methyl-4-[2-(5-nitro-pyridyl)-dithio]pentanoate (SMNP) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,563,304) The most preferred connecting peptide molecules for use in the inventive composition are SPP, SMCC, and SPDB. In a preferred embodiment, SPDB is used to link an effector molecule to a binding molecule of the invention.\n\n\nPreferred cytotoxic effector molecules for use in the present invention are cytotoxic drugs, particularly those which are used for cancer therapy. As used herein, “a cytotoxin or cytotoxic agent” means any agent that is detrimental to the growth and proliferation of cells and may act to reduce, inhibit or destroy a cell or malignancy. Exemplary cytotoxins include, but are not limited to, radionuclides, biotoxins, enzymatically active toxins, cytostatic or cytotoxic therapeutic agents, prodrugs, immunologically active ligands and biological response modifiers such as cytokines. Any cytotoxin that acts to retard or slow the growth of immunoreactive cells or malignant cells is within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nExemplary cytotoxins include, in general, cytostatic agents, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, anti-proliferative agents, tubulin binding agents, hormones and hormone antagonists, and the like. Exemplary cytostatics that are compatible with the present invention include alkylating substances, such as mechlorethamine, triethylenephosphoramide, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, chlorambucil, busulfan, melphalan or triaziquone, also nitrosourea compounds, such as carmustine, lomustine, or semustine.\n\n\nParticularly preferred molecules for conjugation are maytansinoids. Maytansinoids were originally isolated from the east African shrub belonging to the genus \nMaytenus\n, but were subsequently also discovered to be metabolites of soil bacteria, such as Actinosynnema pretiosum (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,896,111). Maytansinoids are known in the art to include maytansine, maytansinol, C-3 esters of maytansinol, and other maytansinol analogues and derivatives (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020 and 6,441,163). C-3 esters of maytansinol can be naturally occurring or synthetically derived. Moreover, both naturally occurring and synthetic C-3 maytansinol esters can be classified as a C-3 ester with simple carboxylic acids, or a C-3 ester with derivatives of N-methyl-L-alanine, the latter being more cytotoxic than the former. Synthetic maytansinoid analogues also are known in the art and described in, for example, Kupchan et al., J. Med. Chem., 21, 31-37 (1978). Methods for generating maytansinol and analogues and derivatives thereof are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,151,042.\n\n\nSuitable maytansinoids for use as antibody conjugates can be isolated from natural sources, synthetically produced, or semi-synthetically produced using methods known in the art. Moreover, the maytansinoid can be modified in any suitable manner, so long as sufficient cytotoxicity is preserved in the ultimate conjugate molecule.\n\n\nParticularly preferred maytansinoids comprising a linking molecule that contains a reactive chemical group are C-3 esters of maytansinol and its analogs where the linking molecule contains a disulfide bond and the attachment molecule comprises a N-succinimidyl or N-sulfosuccinimidyl ester. Many positions on maytansinoids can serve as the position to chemically link the linking molecule, e.g., through an effector attachment molecule. For example, the C-3 position having a hydroxyl group, the C-14 position modified with hydroxymethyl, the C-15 position modified with hydroxy and the C-20 position having a hydroxy group are all useful. The linking molecule most preferably is linked to the C-3 position of maytansinol. Most preferably, the maytansinoid used in connection with the inventive composition is N.sup.2′-deacetyl-N.sup.2′-(-3-mercapto-1-oxopropyl)-maytansine (DM1) or N.sup.2′-deacetyl-N.sup.2′-(4-mercapto-4-methyl-1-oxopentyl)-maytansine (DM4).\n\n\nLinking molecules with other chemical bonds also can be used in the context of the invention, as can other maytansinoids. Specific examples of other chemical bonds which may be incorporated in the linking molecules include those described above, such as, for example acid labile bonds, thioether bonds, photolabile bonds, peptidase labile bonds and esterase labile bonds. Methods for producing maytansinoids with linking molecules and/or effector attachment molecules are described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,208,020, 5,416,064, and 6,333,410.\n\n\nThe linking molecule (and/or the effector attachment molecule) of a maytansinoid typically and preferably is part of a larger connecting peptide molecule that is used to join the antibody to the maytansinoid. Any suitable connecting peptide molecule can be used in connection with the invention, so long as the linking molecule provides for retention of the cytotoxicity and targeting characteristics of the maytansinoid and the antibody, respectively. The linking molecule joins the maytansinoid to the antibody through chemical bonds (as described above), such that the maytansinoid and the antibody are chemically coupled (e.g., covalently bonded) to each other. Desirably, the linking molecule chemically couples the maytansinoid to the antibody through disulfide bonds or thioether bonds. Most preferably, the antibody is chemically coupled to the maytansinoid via disulfide bonds.\n\n\nOther preferred classes of cytotoxic agents include, for example, the anthracycline family of drugs, the vinca drugs, the mitomycins, the bleomycins, the cytotoxic nucleosides, the pteridine family of drugs, diynenes, and the podophyllotoxins. Particularly useful members of those classes include, for example, adriamycin, caminomycin, daunorubicin (daunomycin), doxorubicin, aminopterin, methotrexate, methopterin, mithramycin, streptonigrin, dichloromethotrexate, mitomycin C, actinomycin-D, porfiromycin, 5-fluorouracil, floxuridine, ftorafur, 6-mercaptopurine, cytarabine, cytosine arabinoside, podophyllotoxin, or podophyllotoxin derivatives such as etoposide or etoposide phosphate, melphalan, vinblastine, vincristine, leurosidine, vindesine, leurosine and the like. Still other cytotoxins that are compatible with the teachings herein include taxol, taxane, cytochalasin B, gramicidin D, ethidium bromide, emetine, tenoposide, colchicin, dihydroxy anthracin dione, mitoxantrone, procaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, propranolol, and puromycin and analogs or homologs thereof. Hormones and hormone antagonists, such as corticosteroids, e.g. prednisone, progestins, e.g. hydroxyprogesterone or medroprogesterone, estrogens, e.g. diethylstilbestrol, antiestrogens, e.g. tamoxifen, androgens, e.g. testosterone, and aromatase inhibitors, e.g. aminogluthetimide are also compatible with the teachings herein. As noted previously, one skilled in the art may make chemical modifications to the desired compound in order to make reactions of that compound more convenient for purposes of preparing conjugates of the invention.\n\n\nOne example of particularly preferred cytotoxins comprise members or derivatives of the enediyne family of anti-tumor antibiotics, including calicheamicin, esperamicins or dynemicins. These toxins are extremely potent and act by cleaving nuclear DNA, leading to cell death. Unlike protein toxins which can be cleaved in vivo to give many inactive but immunogenic polypeptide fragments, toxins such as calicheamicin, esperamicins and other enediynes are small molecules which are essentially non-immunogenic. These non-peptide toxins are chemically-linked to the dimers or tetramers by techniques which have been previously used to label monoclonal antibodies and other molecules. These linking technologies include site-specific linkage via the N-linked sugar residues present only on the Fc portion of the constructs. Such site-directed linking methods have the advantage of reducing the possible effects of linkage on the binding properties of the constructs.\n\n\nAmong other cytotoxins, it will be appreciated that polypeptides can also be associated with a biotoxin such as ricin subunit A, abrin, diptheria toxin, botulinum, cyanginosins, saxitoxin, shigatoxin, tetanus, tetrodotoxin, trichothecene, verrucologen or a toxic enzyme. Preferably, such constructs will be made using genetic engineering techniques that allow for direct expression of the binding molecule-toxin construct. Other biological response modifiers that may be associated with the polypeptides of the invention of the present invention comprise cytokines such as lymphokines and interferons. In view of the instant disclosure it is submitted that one skilled in the art could readily form such constructs using conventional techniques.\n\n\nAnother class of compatible cytotoxins that may be used in conjunction with the disclosed polypeptides are radiosensitizing drugs that may be effectively directed to tumor or immunoreactive cells. Such drugs enhance the sensitivity to ionizing radiation, thereby increasing the efficacy of radiotherapy. A conjugate internalized by the tumor cell would deliver the radiosensitizer nearer the nucleus where radiosensitization would be maximal. The unbound radiosensitizer linked polypeptides of the invention would be cleared quickly from the blood, localizing the remaining radiosensitization agent in the target tumor and providing minimal uptake in normal tissues. After rapid clearance from the blood, adjunct radiotherapy would be administered in one of three ways: 1.) external beam radiation directed specifically to the tumor, 2.) radioactivity directly implanted in the tumor or 3.) systemic radioimmunotherapy with the same binding molecule. A potentially attractive variation of this approach would be the attachment of a therapeutic radioisotope to the radiosensitized immunoconjugate, thereby providing the convenience of administering to the patient a single drug.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a molecule that enhances the stability or efficacy of the polypeptide can be conjugated. For example, in one embodiment, PEG can be conjugated to the polypeptides of the invention to increase their half-life in vivo. Leong, S. R., et al. 2001\n. Cytokine \n16:106; 2002\n; Adv. in Drug Deliv. Rev. \n54:531; or Weir et al. 2002. Biochem. Soc. Transactions 30:512.\n\n\nAs previously alluded to, compatible cytotoxins may comprise a prodrug. As used herein, the term “prodrug” refers to a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance that is less cytotoxic to tumor cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically activated or converted into the more active parent form. Prodrugs compatible with the invention include, but are not limited to, phosphate-containing prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing prodrugs, sulfate containing prodrugs, peptide containing prodrugs, β-lactam-containing prodrugs, optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide-containing prodrugs, 5-fluorocytosine and other 5-fluorouridine prodrugs that can be converted to the more active cytotoxic free drug. In one embodiment, a cytotoxic agent, such as a maytansinoid, is administered as a prodrug which is released by the hydrolysis of disulfide bonds. Further examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in the present invention comprise those chemotherapeutic agents described above.\n\n\nXIII. Administration of Binding Molecules\n\n\nMethods of preparing and administering binding molecules of the invention to a subject are well known to or are readily determined by those skilled in the art. The route of administration of the binding molecules of the invention may be oral, parenteral, by inhalation or topical. The term parenteral as used herein includes intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, rectal or vaginal administration. The intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous and intramuscular forms of parenteral administration are generally preferred. While all these forms of administration are clearly contemplated as being within the scope of the invention, a form for administration would be a solution for injection, in particular for intravenous or intraarterial injection or drip. Usually, a suitable pharmaceutical composition for injection may comprise a buffer (e.g. acetate, phosphate or citrate buffer), a surfactant (e.g. polysorbate), optionally a stabilizer agent (e.g. human albumin), etc. However, in other methods compatible with the teachings herein, the polypeptides can be delivered directly to the site of the adverse cellular population thereby increasing the exposure of the diseased tissue to the therapeutic agent.\n\n\nPreparations for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. In the subject invention, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, 0.01-0.1M and preferably 0.05M phosphate buffer or 0.8% saline. Other common parenteral vehicles include sodium phosphate solutions, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's, or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers, such as those based on Ringer's dextrose, and the like. Preservatives and other additives may also be present such as for example, antimicrobials, antioxidants, chelating agents, and inert gases and the like. More particularly, pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In such cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and will preferably be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols, such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.\n\n\nIn any case, sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating an active compound (e.g., a polypeptide by itself or in combination with other active agents) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated herein, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle, which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying, which yields a powder of an active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The preparations for injections are processed, filled into containers such as ampoules, bags, bottles, syringes or vials, and sealed under aseptic conditions according to methods known in the art. Further, the preparations may be packaged and sold in the form of a kit such as those described in co-pending U.S. Ser. No. 09/259,337 and U.S. Ser. No. 09/259,338 each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such articles of manufacture will preferably have labels or package inserts indicating that the associated compositions are useful for treating a subject suffering from, or predisposed to autoimmune or neoplastic disorders.\n\n\nEffective doses of the stabilized binding molecules of the present invention, for the treatment of the above described conditions vary depending upon many different factors, including means of administration, target site, physiological state of the patient, whether the patient is human or an animal, other medications administered, and whether treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. Usually, the patient is a human, but non-human mammals including transgenic mammals can also be treated. Treatment dosages may be titrated using routine methods known to those of skill in the art to optimize safety and efficacy.\n\n\nFor passive immunization with a binding molecule of the invention, the dosage may range, e.g., from about 0.0001 to 100 mg/kg, and more usually 0.01 to 5 mg/kg (e.g., 0.02 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 0.75 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, etc.), of the host body weight. For example dosages can be 1 mg/kg body weight or 10 mg/kg body weight or within the range of 1-10 mg/kg, preferably at least 1 mg/kg. Doses intermediate in the above ranges are also intended to be within the scope of the invention.\n\n\nSubjects can be administered such doses daily, on alternative days, weekly or according to any other schedule determined by empirical analysis. An exemplary treatment entails administration in multiple dosages over a prolonged period, for example, of at least six months. Additional exemplary treatment regimes entail administration once per every two weeks or once a month or once every 3 to 6 months. Exemplary dosage schedules include 1-10 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg on consecutive days, 30 mg/kg on alternate days or 60 mg/kg weekly. In some methods, two or more monoclonal antibodies with different binding specificities are administered simultaneously, in which case the dosage of each antibody administered may fall within the ranges indicated.\n\n\nBinding molecules of the invention can be administered on multiple occasions. Intervals between single dosages can be, e.g., daily, weekly, monthly or yearly. Intervals can also be irregular as indicated by measuring blood levels of polypeptide or target molecule in the patient. In some methods, dosage is adjusted to achieve a certain plasma binding molecule or toxin concentration, e.g., 1-1000 μg/ml or 25-300 μg/ml. Alternatively, binding molecules can be administered as a sustained release formulation, in which case less frequent administration is required. Dosage and frequency vary depending on the half-life of the antibody in the patient. In general, humanized antibodies show the longest half-life, followed by chimeric antibodies and nonhuman antibodies. In one embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention can be administered in unconjugated form, In another embodiment, the polypeptides of the invention can be administered multiple times in conjugated form. In still another embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention can be administered in unconjugated form, then in conjugated form, or vise versa.\n\n\nThe dosage and frequency of administration can vary depending on whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the present antibodies or a cocktail thereof are administered to a patient not already in the disease state to enhance the patient's resistance. Such an amount is defined to be a “prophylactic effective dose.” In this use, the precise amounts again depend upon the patient's state of health and general immunity, but generally range from 0.1 to 25 mg per dose, especially 0.5 to 2.5 mg per dose. A relatively low dosage is administered at relatively infrequent intervals over a long period of time. Some patients continue to receive treatment for the rest of their lives.\n\n\nIn therapeutic applications, a relatively high dosage (e.g., from about 1 to 400 mg/kg of binding molecule, e.g., antibody per dose, with dosages of from 5 to 25 mg being more commonly used for radioimmunoconjugates and higher doses for cytotoxin-drug conjugated molecules) at relatively short intervals is sometimes required until progression of the disease is reduced or terminated, and preferably until the patient shows partial or complete amelioration of symptoms of disease. Thereafter, the patent can be administered a prophylactic regime.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a subject can be treated with a nucleic acid molecule encoding a polypeptide of the invention (e.g., in a vector). Doses for nucleic acids encoding polypeptides range from about 10 ng to 1 g, 100 ng to 100 mg, 1 μg to 10 mg, or 30-300 μg DNA per patient. Doses for infectious viral vectors vary from 10-100, or more, virions per dose.\n\n\nTherapeutic agents can be administered by parenteral, topical, intravenous, oral, subcutaneous, intraarterial, intracranial, intraperitoneal, intranasal or intramuscular means for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment. Intramuscular injection or intravenous infusion are preferred for administration of a binding molecule of the invention. In some methods, particular therapeutic binding molecules are injected directly into the cranium. In some methods, binding molecules are administered as a sustained release composition or device, such as a Medipad™ device.\n\n\nAgents of the invention can optionally be administered in combination with other agents that are effective in treating the disorder or condition in need of treatment (e.g., prophylactic or therapeutic). Preferred additional agents are those which are art recognized and are standardly administered for a particular disorder.\n\n\nEffective single treatment dosages (i.e., therapeutically effective amounts) of \n90\nY-labeled polypeptides of the invention range from between about 5 and about 75 mCi, more preferably between about 10 and about 40 mCi. Effective single treatment non-marrow ablative dosages of \n131\nI-labeled antibodies range from between about 5 and about 70 mCi, more preferably between about 5 and about 40 mCi. Effective single treatment ablative dosages (i.e., may require autologous bone marrow transplantation) of \n131\n-labeled antibodies range from between about 30 and about 600 mCi, more preferably between about 50 and less than about 500 mCi. In conjunction with a chimeric modified antibody, owing to the longer circulating half life vis-à-vis murine antibodies, an effective single treatment non-marrow ablative dosages of iodine-131 labeled chimeric antibodies range from between about 5 and about 40 mCi, more preferably less than about 30 mCi. Imaging criteria for, e.g., the \n111\nIn label, are typically less than about 5 mCi.\n\n\nWhile a great deal of clinical experience has been gained with \n131\nI and \n90\nY, other radiolabels are known in the art and have been used for similar purposes. Still other radioisotopes are used for imaging. For example, additional radioisotopes which are compatible with the scope of the instant invention include, but are not limited to, \n123\nI, \n125\nI, \n32\nP, \n57\nCo, \n64\nCu, \n67\nCu, \n77\nBr, \n81\nRb, \n81\nKr, \n87\nSr, \n113\nIn, \n127\nCs, \n129\nCs, \n132\nI, \n197\nHg, \n203\nPb, \n206\nBi, \n177\nLu, \n186\nRe, \n212\nPb, \n212\nBi, \n47\nSc, \n105\nRh, \n109\nPd, \n153\nSm, \n188\nRe, \n199\nAu, \n225\nAc, \n211\nAt, and \n213\nBi. In this respect alpha, gamma and beta emitters are all compatible with in the instant invention. Further, in view of the instant disclosure it is submitted that one skilled in the art could readily determine which radionuclides are compatible with a selected course of treatment without undue experimentation. To this end, additional radionuclides which have already been used in clinical diagnosis include \n125\n, \n123\nI, \n99\nTc, \n43\nK, \n52\nFe, \n67\nGa, \n68\nGa, as well as \n111\nIn. Antibodies have also been labeled with a variety of radionuclides for potential use in targeted immunotherapy (Peirersz et al. \nImmunol. Cell Biol. \n65: 111-125 (1987)). These radionuclides include \n188\nRe and \n186\nRe as well as \n199\nAu and \n67\nCu to a lesser extent. U.S. Pat. No. 5,460,785 provides additional data regarding such radioisotopes and is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nWhether or not the binding molecules of the invention are used in a conjugated or unconjugated form, it will be appreciated that a major advantage of the present invention is the ability to use these polypeptides in myelosuppressed patients, especially those who are undergoing, or have undergone, adjunct therapies such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy. In other preferred embodiments, the polypeptides (again in a conjugated or unconjugated form) may be used in a combined therapeutic regimen with chemotherapeutic agents. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that such therapeutic regimens may comprise the sequential, simultaneous, concurrent or coextensive administration of the disclosed antibodies and one or more chemotherapeutic agents. Particularly preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention will comprise the administration of a toxin conjugated binding molecule, e.g., conjugated to a maytansinoid such as a D4 maytansinoid.\n\n\nWhile the binding molecules may be administered as described immediately above, it must be emphasized that in other embodiments conjugated and unconjugated polypeptides may be administered to otherwise healthy patients as a first line therapeutic agent. In such embodiments the polypeptides may be administered to patients having normal or average red marrow reserves and/or to patients that have not, and are not, undergoing adjunct therapies such as external beam radiation or chemotherapy.\n\n\nHowever, as discussed above, selected embodiments of the invention comprise the administration of binding molecules to myelosuppressed patients or in combination or conjunction with one or more adjunct therapies such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy (i.e. a combined therapeutic regimen). As used herein, the administration of polypeptides in conjunction or combination with an adjunct therapy means the sequential, simultaneous, coextensive, concurrent, concomitant or contemporaneous administration or application of the therapy and the disclosed binding molecules. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the administration or application of the various components of the combined therapeutic regimen may be timed to enhance the overall effectiveness of the treatment. For example, chemotherapeutic agents could be administered in standard, well known courses of treatment followed within a few weeks by radioimmunoconjugates of the present invention. Conversely, cytotoxin associated polypeptides could be administered intravenously followed by tumor localized external beam radiation. In yet other embodiments, the polypeptide may be administered concurrently with one or more selected chemotherapeutic agents in a single office visit. A skilled artisan (e.g. an experienced oncologist) would readily be able to discern effective combined therapeutic regimens without undue experimentation based on the selected adjunct therapy and the teachings of the instant specification.\n\n\nIn this regard it will be appreciated that the combination of the binding molecules (either conjugated or unconjugated) and the chemotherapeutic agent may be administered in any order and within any time frame that provides a therapeutic benefit to the patient. That is, the chemotherapeutic agent and polypeptide may be administered in any order or concurrently. Binding molecules and chemotherapeutic agents may be administered separately or may be administered in the form of one composition. In selected embodiments the polypeptides of the present invention will be administered to patients that have previously undergone chemotherapy. In yet other embodiments, the polypeptides and the chemotherapeutic treatment will be administered substantially simultaneously or concurrently. For example, the patient may be given the binding molecule while undergoing a course of chemotherapy. In preferred embodiments the binding molecule will be administered within 1 year of any chemotherapeutic agent or treatment. In other preferred embodiments the polypeptide will be administered within 10, 8, 6, 4, or 2 months of any chemotherapeutic agent or treatment. In still other preferred embodiments the polypeptide will be administered within 4, 3, 2 or 1 week of any chemotherapeutic agent or treatment. In yet other embodiments the polypeptide will be administered within 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 days of the selected chemotherapeutic agent or treatment. It will further be appreciated that the two agents or treatments may be administered to the patient within a matter of hours or minutes (i.e. substantially simultaneously).\n\n\nMoreover, in accordance with the present invention a myelosuppressed patient shall be held to mean any patient exhibiting lowered blood counts. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are several blood count parameters conventionally used as clinical indicators of myelosuppresion and one can easily measure the extent to which myelosuppresion is occurring in a patient. Examples of art accepted myelosuppression measurements are the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) or platelet count. Such myelosuppression or partial myeloablation may be a result of various biochemical disorders or diseases or, more likely, as the result of prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In this respect, those skilled in the art will appreciate that patients who have undergone traditional chemotherapy typically exhibit reduced red marrow reserves. As discussed above, such subjects often cannot be treated using optimal levels of cytotoxin (i.e. radionuclides) due to unacceptable side effects such as anemia or immunosuppression that result in increased mortality or morbidity.\n\n\nMore specifically conjugated or unconjugated polypeptides of the present invention may be used to effectively treat patients having ANCs lower than about 2000/mm\n3 \nor platelet counts lower than about 150,000/mm\n3\n. More preferably the polypeptides of the present invention may be used to treat patients having ANCs of less than about 1500/mm\n3\n, less than about 1000/mm\n3 \nor even more preferably less than about 500/mm\n3\n. Similarly, the polypeptides of the present invention may be used to treat patients having a platelet count of less than about 75,000/mm\n3\n, less than about 50,000/mm\n3 \nor even less than about 10,000/mm\n3\n. In a more general sense, those skilled in the art will easily be able to determine when a patient is myelosuppressed using government implemented guidelines and procedures.\n\n\nAs indicated above, many myelosuppressed patients have undergone courses of treatment including chemotherapy, implant radiotherapy or external beam radiotherapy. In the case of the latter, an external radiation source is for local irradiation of a malignancy. For radiotherapy implantation methods, radioactive reagents are surgically located within the malignancy, thereby selectively irradiating the site of the disease. In any event, the disclosed polypeptides may be used to treat disorders in patients exhibiting myelosuppression regardless of the cause.\n\n\nIn this regard it will further be appreciated that the polypeptides of the instant invention may be used in conjunction or combination with any chemotherapeutic agent or agents (e.g. to provide a combined therapeutic regimen) that eliminates, reduces, inhibits or controls the growth of neoplastic cells in vivo. As discussed, such agents often result in the reduction of red marrow reserves. This reduction may be offset, in whole or in part, by the diminished myelotoxicity of the compounds of the present invention that advantageously allow for the aggressive treatment of neoplasias in such patients. In other preferred embodiments the radiolabeled immunoconjugates disclosed herein may be effectively used with radiosensitizers that increase the susceptibility of the neoplastic cells to radionuclides. For example, radiosensitizing compounds may be administered after the radiolabeled binding molecule has been largely cleared from the bloodstream but still remains at therapeutically effective levels at the site of the tumor or tumors.\n\n\nWith respect to these aspects of the invention, exemplary chemotherapeutic agents that are compatible with the instant invention include alkylating agents, vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine), procarbazine, methotrexate and prednisone. The four-drug combination MOPP (mechlethamine (nitrogen mustard), vincristine (Oncovin), procarbazine and prednisone) is very effective in treating various types of lymphoma and comprises a preferred embodiment of the present invention. In MOPP-resistant patients, ABVD (e.g., adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine), ChlVPP (chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine and prednisone), CABS (lomustine, doxorubicin, bleomycin and streptozotocin), MOPP plus ABVD, MOPP plus ABV (doxorubicin, bleomycin and vinblastine) or BCVPP (carmustine, cyclophosphamide, vinblastine, procarbazine and prednisone) combinations can be used. Arnold S. Freedman and Lee M. Nadler, \nMalignant Lymphomas\n, in H\nARRISON'S P\n \nRINCIPLES OF \nI\nNTERNAL \nM\nEDICINE \n1774-1788 (Kurt J. Isselbacher et al., eds., 13\nth \ned. 1994) and V. T. DeVita et al., (1997) and the references cited therein for standard dosing and scheduling. These therapies can be used unchanged, or altered as needed for a particular patient, in combination with one or more polypeptides of the invention as described herein.\n\n\nAdditional regimens that are useful in the context of the present invention include use of single alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil, or combinations such as CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone), CHOP (CVP and doxorubicin), C-MOPP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine), CAP-BOP (CHOP plus procarbazine and bleomycin), m-BACOD (CHOP plus methotrexate, bleomycin and leucovorin), ProMACE-MOPP (prednisone, methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and leucovorin plus standard MOPP), ProMACE-CytaBOM (prednisone, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine, methotrexate and leucovorin) and MACOP-B (methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, fixed dose prednisone, bleomycin and leucovorin). Those skilled in the art will readily be able to determine standard dosages and scheduling for each of these regimens. CHOP has also been combined with bleomycin, methotrexate, procarbazine, nitrogen mustard, cytosine arabinoside and etoposide. Other compatible chemotherapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA), 2′-deoxycoformycin and fludarabine.\n\n\nFor patients with intermediate- and high-grade NHL, who fail to achieve remission or relapse, salvage therapy is used. Salvage therapies employ drugs such as cytosine arabinoside, cisplatin, etoposide and ifosfamide given alone or in combination. In relapsed or aggressive forms of certain neoplastic disorders the following protocols are often used: IMVP-16 (ifosfamide, methotrexate and etoposide), MIME (methyl-gag, ifosfamide, methotrexate and etoposide), DHAP (dexamethasone, high dose cytarabine and cisplatin), ESHAP (etoposide, methylpredisolone, HD cytarabine, cisplatin), CEPP(B) (cyclophosphamide, etoposide, procarbazine, prednisone and bleomycin) and CAMP (lomustine, mitoxantrone, cytarabine and prednisone) each with well known dosing rates and schedules.\n\n\nThe amount of chemotherapeutic agent to be used in combination with the polypeptides of the instant invention may vary by subject or may be administered according to what is known in the art. See for example, Bruce A Chabner et al., \nAntineoplastic Agents\n, in G\nOODMAN \n& G\nILMAN'S \nT\nHE \nP\nHARMACOLOGICAL \nB\nASIS OF \nT\nHERAPEUTICS\n1233-1287 ((Joel G. Hardman et al., eds., 9\nth \ned. 1996).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention may be administered to a subject who has undergone, is undergoing, or will undergo a surgical procedure, e.g., to remove a primary tumor, a metastasis or precancerous growth or tissue as a preventative therapy.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is administered in conjunction with a biologic. Biologics useful in the treatment of cancers are known in the art and a binding molecule of the invention may be administered, for example, in conjunction with such known biologics.\n\n\nFor example, the FDA has approved the following biologics for the treatment of breast cancer: Herceptin® (trastuzumab, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, Calif.; a humanized monoclonal antibody that has antitumor activity in HER2-positive breast cancer); Faslodex® (fulvestrant, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP, Wilmington, Del.; an estrogen-receptor antagonist used to treat breast cancer); Arimidex® (anastrozole, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP; a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor which blocks aromatase, an enzyme needed to make estrogen); Aromasin® (exemestane, Pfizer Inc., New York, N.Y.; an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator used in the treatment of breast cancer); Femara® (letrozole, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, N.J.; a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor approved by the FDA to treat breast cancer); and Nolvadex® (tamoxifen, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, LP; a nonsteroidal antiestrogen approved by the FDA to treat breast cancer). Other biologics with which the binding molecules of the invention may be combined include: Avastin™ (bevacizumab, Genentech Inc.; the first FDA-approved therapy designed to inhibit angiogenesis); and Zevalin® (ibritumomab tiuxetan, Biogen Idec, Cambridge, Mass.; a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody currently approved for the treatment of B-cell lymphomas).\n\n\nIn addition, the FDA has approved the following biologics for the treatment of colorectal cancer: Avastin™; Erbitux™ (cetuximab, ImClone Systems Inc., New York, N.Y., and Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, N.Y.; is a monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)); Gleevec® (imatinib mesylate; a protein kinase inhibitor); and Ergamisol® (levamisole hydrochloride, Janssen Pharmaceutica Products, LP, Titusville, N.J.; an immunomodulator approved by the FDA in 1990 as an adjuvant treatment in combination with 5-fluorouracil after surgical resection in patients with Dukes' Stage C colon cancer).\n\n\nFor use in treatment of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas currently approved therapies include: Bexxar® (tositumomab and iodine I-131 tositumomab, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, N.C.; a multi-step treatment involving a mouse monoclonal antibody (tositumomab) linked to a radioactive molecule (iodine I-131)); Intron® A (interferon alfa-2b, Schering Corporation, Kenilworth, N.J.; a type of interferon approved for the treatment of follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in conjunction with anthracycline-containing combination chemotherapy (e.g., cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [CHOP])); Rituxan® (rituximab, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, Calif., and Biogen Idec, Cambridge, Mass.; a monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Ontak® (denileukin diftitox, Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, Calif.; a fusion protein consisting of a fragment of diphtheria toxin genetically fused to interleukin-2); and Zevalin® (ibritumomab tiuxetan, Biogen Idec; a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA for the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas).\n\n\nFor treatment of Leukemia, exemplary biologics which may be used in combination with the binding molecules of the invention include Gleevec®; Campath®-1H (alemtuzumab, Berlex Laboratories, Richmond, Calif.; a type of monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of chronic Lymphocytic leukemia). In addition, Genasense (oblimersen, Genta Corporation, Berkley Heights, N.J.; a BCL-2 antisense therapy under development to treat leukemia may be used (e.g., alone or in combination with one or more chemotherapy drugs, such as fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) may be administered with the claimed binding molecules.\n\n\nFor the treatment of lung cancer, exemplary biologics include Tarceva™ (erlotinib HCL, OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc., Melville, N.Y.; a small molecule designed to target the human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (HER1) pathway).\n\n\nFor the treatment of multiple myeloma, exemplary biologics include Velcade® Velcade (bortezomib, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge Mass.; a proteasome inhibitor). Additional biologics include Thalidomid® (thalidomide, Clegene Corporation, Warren, N.J.; an immunomodulatory agent and appears to have multiple actions, including the ability to inhibit the growth and survival of myeloma cells and antiangiogenesis).\n\n\nOther exemplary biologics include the MOAB IMC-C225, developed by ImClone Systems, Inc., New York, N.Y.\n\n\nIn addition, the claimed binding molecules may be administered in conjunction with vaccines or other agents (e.g., cytokines) to modulate anti-cancer immune responses. For example, Melacine® (Corixa Corporation, Seattle, Wash.) is an allogeneic tumor vaccine that has been reported to have promising results in the treatment of T3N0M0 resected melanoma. GMK® (Progenics Pharmaceutical, Inc., Tarrytown, N.Y.) is a ganglioside antigen administered as an adjuvant phase III agent in patients who are at high risk for melanoma recurrence. Anti-gastrin therapeutic Vaccine® (Aphton Corporation, Miami, Fla.) neutralizes hormones G17 and glyextened and is in phase III clinical trials for patients with colorectal, pancreatic, and stomach cancers. CeaVac® (Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif.) is an anti-idiotype antibody vaccine being studied in colorectal cancer. Finally, Theratope® (Biomira Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) is a synthetic carbohydrate therapeutic vaccine being investigated as a phase III agent in patients with metastatic breast cancer (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, 2000).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention may be administered in conjunction with an anti-angiogenic agent, e.g., Endostatin (an endogenous, tumor-derived, endothelial-specific inhibitor that halts microvascular endothelial cell production); anti-VEGF antibody; thalidomide; or matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors inhibit the synthesis and degradation of the basement membrane of blood vessels).\n\n\nAs previously discussed, the binding molecules of the present invention, immunoreactive fragments or recombinants thereof may be administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount for the in vivo treatment of mammalian disorders. In this regard, it will be appreciated that the disclosed binding molecules will be formulated so as to facilitate administration and promote stability of the active agent. Preferably, pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with the present invention comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable, non-toxic, sterile carrier such as physiological saline, non-toxic buffers, preservatives and the like. For the purposes of the instant application, a pharmaceutically effective amount of a binding molecule of the invention, conjugated or unconjugated to a therapeutic agent, shall be held to mean an amount sufficient to achieve effective binding to a target and to achieve a benefit, e.g., to ameliorate symptoms of a disease or disorder or to detect a substance or a cell. In the case of tumor cells, the polypeptide will be preferably be capable of interacting with selected immunoreactive antigens on neoplastic or immunoreactive cells and provide for an increase in the death of those cells. Of course, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in single or multiple doses to provide for a pharmaceutically effective amount of the polypeptide.\n\n\nIn keeping with the scope of the present disclosure, the polypeptides of the invention may be administered to a human or other animal in accordance with the aforementioned methods of treatment in an amount sufficient to produce a therapeutic or prophylactic effect. The polypeptides of the invention can be administered to such human or other animal in a conventional dosage form prepared by combining the binding molecule of the invention with a conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent according to known techniques. It will be recognized by one of skill in the art that the form and character of the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent is dictated by the amount of active ingredient with which it is to be combined, the route of administration and other well-known variables. Those skilled in the art will further appreciate that a cocktail comprising one or more species of polypeptides according to the present invention may prove to be particularly effective.\n\n\nXIV. Methods of Use\n\n\nThe molecules of the invention can be used in circumstances where it is desirable to use stabilized scFv molecules or compositions comprising such scFv molecules, e.g., for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide compounds, compositions, kits and methods for the diagnosis and/or treatment of disorders that would benefit from administration of a binding molecule of the invention, e.g., neoplastic disorders in a mammalian subject in need of such treatment. Preferably, the subject is a human.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the subject binding molecules may be used in an assay to detect a tumor antigen in vitro, e.g., using an ELISA assay. Exemplary assays are known in the art, see, e.g., United States Application Number 20040077025.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the subject binding molecules are useful for detecting the presence of tumor antigen bearing cells using imaging technology. For such applications, it may be desirable to conjugate the binding molecule to a detectable molecule, e.g., a radiolabel, as described further below.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the subject binding molecules are useful for reducing or eliminating cells (e.g. by apoptosis) bearing an epitope (e.g., an epitope of Cripto or an epitope of a TNF receptor family member, eg. TRAIL-R2 or LTβR) recognized by a binding molecule of the invention. In another embodiment, the subject binding molecules are effective in reducing the concentration of or eliminating soluble target molecules in the circulation.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention reduces tumor size, inhibits tumor growth and/or prolongs the survival time of a tumor-bearing subject. Accordingly, this invention also relates to a method of treating tumors in a human or other animal by administering to such human or animal an effective, non-toxic amount of polypeptide. One skilled in the art would be able, by routine experimentation, to determine what an effective, non-toxic amount of polypeptide would be for the purpose of treating malignancies. For example, a therapeutically active amount of a polypeptide may vary according to factors such as the disease stage (e.g., stage I versus stage 1V), age, sex, medical complications (e.g., immunosuppressed conditions or diseases) and weight of the subject, and the ability of the binding molecule to elicit a desired response in the subject. The dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily, or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. Generally, however, an effective dosage is expected to be in the range of about 0.05 to 100 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day and more preferably from about 0.5 to 10, milligrams per kilogram body weight per day.\n\n\nFor purposes of clarification “mammal” refers to any animal classified as a mammal, including humans, domestic and farm animals, and zoo, sports, or pet animals, such as dogs, horses, cats, cows, etc. Preferably, the mammal is human. “Treatment” refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disease or disorder as well as those in which the disease or disorder is to be prevented. Hence, the mammal may have been diagnosed as having the disease or disorder or may be predisposed or susceptible to the disease.\n\n\nIn general, the disclosed compositions may be used to prophylactically or therapeutically. For example, a neoplasm comprising a marker that allows for the targeting of the cancerous cells by the binding molecule may be detected or inhibited (e.g., killed) using a binding molecule of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention are used to treat solid tumors. Exemplary cancers that may be treated include, but are not limited to, prostate, gastric carcinomas such as colon, skin, breast, ovarian, lung and pancreatic cancer. In another embodiment, the antibodies of the instant invention may be used to treat Kaposi's sarcoma, CNS neoplasias (capillary hemangioblastomas, meningiomas and cerebral metastases), melanoma, gastrointestinal and renal sarcomas, rhabdomyosarcoma, glioblastoma (preferably glioblastoma multiforme), leiomyosarcoma, retinoblastoma, papillary cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary, Wilm's tumor or small cell lung carcinoma. It will be appreciated that appropriate polypeptides may be derived for tumor associated molecules related to each of the forgoing neoplasias without undue experimentation in view of the instant disclosure.\n\n\nExemplary hematologic malignancies that are amenable to treatment with the disclosed invention include Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphoma as well as leukemias, including ALL-L3 (Burkitt's type leukemia), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and monocytic cell leukemias. It will be appreciated that the compounds and methods of the present invention are particularly effective in treating a variety of B-cell lymphomas, including low grade/follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), cell lymphoma (FCC), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL), small lymphocytic (SL) NHL, intermediate grade/follicular NHL, intermediate grade diffuse NHL, high grade immunoblastic NHL, high grade lymphoblastic NHL, high grade small non-cleaved cell NHL, bulky disease NHL and Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. It should be clear to those of skill in the art that these lymphomas will often have different names due to changing systems of classification, and that patients having lymphomas classified under different names may also benefit from the combined therapeutic regimens of the present invention. In addition to the aforementioned neoplastic disorders, it will be appreciated that the disclosed invention may advantageously be used to treat additional malignancies bearing compatible tumor associated molecules.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a binding molecule of the invention is capable of binding specifically to a tumor cell antigen and inhibiting growth of tumor cells in a patient. In certain embodiments, the tumor cells are brain, head, neck, prostate, breast, testicular, colon, lung, ovary, bladder, uterine, cervical, pancreatic and stomach tumor cells. In other embodiments, a binding molecule of the invention binds specifically to the tumor cell antigen and inhibits growth of tumor cells which overexpress the antigen. In one embodiment, the tumor cells are cell lines which overexpress the antigen, such as cell lines derived from brain, breast, testicular, colon, lung, ovary, bladder, uterine, cervical, pancreatic and stomach cancers.\n\n\nIn yet other embodiments the binding molecules of the present invention may be used to treat immune disorders that include, but are not limited to, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis; Allergic rhinitis Autoimmune hemolytic anemia; Acanthosis nigricans; Allergic contact dermatitis; Addison's disease; Atopic dermatitis; Alopecia areata; Alopecia universalis; Amyloidosis; Anaphylactoid purpura; Anaphylactoid reaction; Aplastic anemia; Angioedema, hereditary; Angioedema, idiopathic; Ankylosing spondylitis; Arteritis, cranial; Arteritis, giant cell; Arteritis, Takayasu's; Arteritis, temporal; Asthma; Ataxia-telangiectasia; Autoimmune oophoritis; Autoimmune orchitis; Autoimmune polyendocrine failure; Behcet's disease; Berger's disease; Buerger's disease; bronchitis; Bullous pemphigus; Candidiasis, chronic mucocutaneous; Caplan's syndrome; Post-myocardial infarction syndrome; Post-pericardiotomy syndrome; Carditis; Celiac sprue; Chagas's disease; Chediak-Higashi syndrome; Churg-Strauss disease; Cogan's syndrome; Cold agglutinin disease; CREST syndrome; Crohn's disease; Cryoglobulinemia; Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis; Dermatitis herpetifomis; Dermatomyositis; Diabetes mellitus; Diamond-Blackfan syndrome; DiGeorge syndrome; Discoid lupus erythematosus; Eosinophilic fasciitis; Episcleritis; Drythema elevatum diutinum; Erythema marginatum; Erythema multiforme; Erythema nodosum; Familial Mediterranean fever; Felty's syndrome; Fibrosis pulmonary; Glomerulonephritis, anaphylactoid; Glomerulonephritis, autoimmune; Glomerulonephritis, post-streptococcal; Glomerulonephritis, post-transplantation; Glomerulopathy, membranous; Goodpasture's syndrome; Granulocytopenia, immune-mediated; Granuloma annulare; Granulomatosis, allergic; Granulomatous myositis; Grave's disease; Hashimoto's thyroiditis; Hemolytic disease of the newborn; Hemochromatosis, idiopathic; Henoch-Schoenlein purpura; Hepatitis, chronic active and chronic progressive; Histiocytosis X; Hypereosinophilic syndrome; Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; Job's syndrome; Juvenile dermatomyositis; Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (Juvenile chronic arthritis); Kawasaki's disease; Keratitis; Keratoconjunctivitis sicca; Landry-Guillain-Barre-Strohl syndrome; Leprosy, lepromatous; Loeffler's syndrome; lupus; Lyell's syndrome; Lyme disease; Lymphomatoid granulomatosis; Mastocytosis, systemic; Mixed connective tissue disease; Mononeuritis multiplex; Muckle-Wells syndrome; Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis; Multiple sclerosis; Myasthenia gravis; Mycosis fungoides; Necrotizing vasculitis, systemic; Nephrotic syndrome; Overlap syndrome; Panniculitis; Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria; Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; Pemphigoid; Pemphigus; Pemphigus erythematosus; Pemphigus foliaceus; Pemphigus vulgaris; Pigeon breeder's disease; Pneumonitis, hypersensitivity; Polyarteritis nodosa; Polymyalgia rheumatic; Polymyositis; Polyneuritis, idiopathic; Portuguese familial polyneuropathies; Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia; Primary biliary cirrhosis; Progressive systemic sclerosis (Scleroderma); Psoriasis; Psoriatic arthritis; Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis; Pulmonary fibrosis, Raynaud's phenomenon/syndrome; Reidel's thyroiditis; Reiter's syndrome, Relapsing polychrondritis; Rheumatic fever; Rheumatoid arthritis; Sarcoidosis; Scleritis; Sclerosing cholangitis; Serum sickness; Sezary syndrome; Sjogren's syndrome; Stevens-Johnson syndrome; Still's disease; Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis; Sympathetic ophthalmia; Systemic lupus erythematosus; Transplant rejection; Ulcerative colitis; Undifferentiated connective tissue disease; Urticaria, chronic; Urticaria, cold; Uveitis; Vitiligo; Weber-Christian disease; Wegener's granulomatosis and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the binding molecules of the invention can be used for pretargeting applications. For example, the same advantages will be apparent in pretargeting applications for chemotherapeutic drug delivery.\n\n\nFor example, in pretargeting a tumor is pretargeted with a binding construct that has affinity for the tumor-associated antigen on the one hand and for, e.g., a radiolabeled hapten on the other. The radiolabeled hapten is administered later, preferably after the binding construct that has affinity for the tumor-associated antigen has cleared (see, e.g., Boerman et al. 2003. J. Nuclear Med. 44:400). In another example, an antibody which is non-toxic, but has been derivatized to react with a drug or prodrug that is toxic only when bound by the binding molecule. Given the biodistribution data in the instant examples, the binding molecules of the invention are well suited to use in pretargeting applications.

Seventeen of the 18 antibodies were expressed from either stable bulk or clonal CHO cell lines and 1 of the antibodies (BIIB13) was expressed using transient transfection in HEK293E cells. All 18 antibodies contain kappa light chains. The majority of the antibodies were human IgG1; however, BIIB2, BIIB5 and BIIB11 were human IgG4. Seventeen of the 18 antibodies were human or humanized. BIIB15 was PRIMATIZED® (Nakamura et al., 2000). The identity of the human germline for each antibody was assessed by ClustalW alignment (ClustalW WWW Service at the European Bioinformatics Institute, Thompson et al., 1994) of the BIIB V\nH \nor V\nκ \nsequences against the publicly available human germlines (Lefranc et al., 1999).\n\n\nFifteen of the 18 total antibodies were IgG1 subclass and the remaining 3 were IgG4 (BIIB2, BIIB5 and BIIB11). IgG1 and \nIgG4 C\n \n \n \nH\n1 sequences have 10 amino acid differences (6 are conservative) and an alternate disulfide-bonding pattern with the light chain.\n\n\nAn IgG1 and an IgG4 construct with a duplicate Fv region was available to investigate the effect of IgG subclass on Fab stability. Two constructs were created which contained the V\nH \nregion of BIIB7 grafted to either an IgG1 or an IgG4 heavy chain constant region.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nPreparation of Conventional BHA10 scFv and Fab Proteins\n\n\nBHA10 scFv was subcloned from plasmid pXWU034, using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotide primers shown in Table 2 below. The forward primer BHA10-01F contains a unique Sph I restriction endonuclease site (underlined sequence) followed by 18 bases of sequence complementary to the BHA10 N-terminal heavy variable domain gene. The reverse primer, BHA110-0R, contains 24 bases of sequence complementary to the BHA10 C-terminal light variable domain gene, 15 bases of sequence complementary to an Enterokinase Site, and adjacent Hind III and Xba I restriction endonuclease sites (endonuclease sites are underlined). Following PCR amplification, a PCR product corresponding to the expected size was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, excised, and purified using the Millipore Ultrafree-DA extraction kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Millipore; Bedford, Mass.). The purified PCR product was digested with Sph I, made blunt-end by digesting with DNA Polymerase I in the presence of dNTPs, and then digested with Hind III. The blunt-ended/Hind III digested PCR product was ligated to Sca I/Hind III digested pKJS216. pKJS216 is an \nE. coli \nvector that drives recombinant protein expression under the control of an inducible ara C promoter. A portion of the ligation mixture was used to transformed \nE. coli \nstrain XL1-Blue. Ampicillin drug resistant colonies were screened and DNA sequence analysis confirmed the correct sequence of the final pIEH003 construct. DNA and amino acid sequences of BHA10 scFv are shown in \nFIGS. 1A and 1B\n, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOligonucleotides for PCR amplification of a\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nconventional BHA10 scFv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimers\n\n\nSequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBHA10-\n01F\n \n\n\n5′-CAGTA\nGCATGC\nAGGTCCAACTGGTGCAG-3′\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO: 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBHA10-\n02R\n \n\n\n5′-GT\nTCTAGAAAGCTT\nTTGTCGTCGTCGTCTTTGATCTC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID\n\n\nCACCTTGGTACCCTG-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO: 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor expression of BHA10 scFv, freshly isolated colonies of \nE. coli \nstrain W3110 (ATCC, Manassas, Va. Cat. #27325) transformed with plasmid pIEH003 were grown in 4×250 ml SB media (Teknova, Half Moon Bay, Ca. Cat. #S0140) containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin in 1 L baffled flasks to OD\n600\n≅0.8, induced by adding to 0.02% arabinose, and cultured overnight. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation. The pellets were solubilized and lysed using 40 mL B-PER protein extraction reagent (Cat#78243, Pierce). Solubilized scFv was applied to a 5 mL Ni-NTA-Superflow column (Cat#30410, Qiagen). Bound scFv was washed with 60 mM imidazole, pH 8.0 and eluted with 300 mM imidazole, pH 8.0. Eluted scFv was loaded onto a 6 mL Protein L agarose column (Cat#20510, Pierce). Bound protein was washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and eluted with 0.1 M glycine, pH 3.0. Purified scFvs were dialyzed against PBS and stored at −20° C. Protein concentrations were determined using an ε\n280 nm\n=2.1 ml mg\n− \ncm\n−\n.\n\n\nFor enzymatic preparation of BHA10 Fab, BHA10 IgG was mixed with 4 μl of a concentrated papain stock (0.3 mg/mL, 30 Units/mg—Cat#108014, Roche) in 8.3 ml solution containing 2.4 mg/mL BHA10 IgG1, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM EDTA at pH 7.0. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 90 minutes at 25° C. The digest solution was diluted 1:5 with 20 mM acetate, pH 5.0 and loaded onto a 6 ml SP-Sepharose FF column equilibrated with dilution buffer. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of dilution buffer. Crude Fab fragments were eluted with 30 column volumes of a 0-200 mM NaCl linear gradient. A broad peak centering at 140 mM NaCl (˜24 mL total) was collected and contained the majority of the digested IgG material. The eluted volume was reduced to 2 mL by concentration and loaded onto a preparative G300 SW Tosohaas SEC column (109 mL) equilibrated with PBS. Fab was eluted at 0.8 column volumes over 15 mL. Purified Fab was concentrated to between 2-11 mg/mL. Fab concentrations were determined using an ε\n280 nm\n=1.5 mL mg\n−1 \ncm\n−1\n.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nThermal Stability of Conventional BHA10 scFv Molecules\n\n\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to test whether an isolated BHA10 scFv is intrinsically less stable than its Fab counterpart. Scans were performed using an automated capillary differential scanning calorimeter (capDSC, MicroCal, LLC). Protein and reference solutions were sampled automatically from 96-well plates using the robotic attachment. Prior to each protein scan, 2 scans were performed with buffer in the sample cell and used for background subtraction. A single cleaning scan was performed using 5% Liquinox after every protein scan. After every scan, the instrument automatically rinsed both the reference and sample cells three times with 2 ml distilled deionized H\n2\nO containing 0.01% sodium azide. Scans were performed at 1° C./min using the medium feedback mode for enhanced peak resolution. The scan range was 20-95° C. All 96-well plates containing protein were stored within the instrument at 6° C.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n shows DSC measurements with purified BHA10 Fab and scFv antibody fragments. Within the calorimeter, the temperature is raised until the Fab or scFv unfolds. The temperature at which each protein unfolds (i.e., the T\nM \nvalue) can be indicative of the overall stability. All four domains of the BHA10 Fab (V\nH\n, V\nL\n, \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and C\nL\n) unfold cooperatively at 78° C. (\nFIG. 2A\n). The scFv domain lacks the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and C\nL \ndomains. Without this scaffolding, the domains of the scFv unfold at much lower temperatures than the Fab and there is a significant decrease in the calorimetric enthalpy of the domains indicating the loss of stabilizing interactions. The V\nL \ndomain unfolds with a T\nM \nof 68° C., while the V\nH \ndomain unfolds at 58° C., 20° C. lower than what was observed for the unfolding transition of the BHA10 Fab (\nFIG. 2B\n). Additionally, there is a scan rate dependence of the T\nM\n, suggesting that protein aggregation is occurring during the heating phase which artificially lowers the T\nM \nof the scFv as the scan rate is slowed (Sánchez-Ruiz et al., \nBiochemistry, \n27: 1648-1652, 1988). The low apparent stability and the propensity to aggregate may be determining factors for the inability of CHO cells to produce significant quantities of stable, non-aggregated material which contain scFvs such as the conventional Hercules bispecific antibody molecules.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nConstruction of BHA10 scFv Molecules with Improved Thermal Stability\n\n\nKnowing that the BHA10 scFv domain, as evidenced in Example 2, is intrinsically unstable, it was hypothesized that engineering the scFv through the use of recombinant DNA technology to produce a modified scFv that is thermodynamically or functionally equivalent to a Fab under thermal challenge conditions should result in an scFv domain that is useful for constructing a bispecific antibody. Moreover, it was also hypothesized that engineering of the isolated scFv domain by itself should impart whatever beneficial biophysical properties are gained when re-introduced as a component of a full bispecific molecule. Towards that end, an effort to improve the biophysical stability of the BHA10 scFv domain using an \nE. coli \nexpression system and monitored improvements in stability by measuring binding of thermally resistant scFv domains to ligand in a thermal challenge assay was begun.\n\n\nTo stabilize the scFv domains two methods were applied: 1) introducing a disulfide bond between the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomain of the BHA10 scFv; and 2) optimizing the length of the (Gly\n4\nSer)\nn \nlinker that connects the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of the BHA10 scFv.\n\n\nA. Construction of Disulfide-Stabilized BHA10 scFvs\n\n\nThe BHA10 scFv producing bacterial expression vector, pIEH003, was utilized as the parental vector. The QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene; La Jolla, Calif.) was used, according to the manufacturer's instructions, to introduce two cysteine residues, one in V\nH \nand a second in V\nL \nthat could participate in forming a stabilizing disulfide bond. Primer pairs VH44-F and VH44-R (Table 3) were used to mutagenize the Gly residue (GGA) at position 44 (Kabat numbering system) of BHA10 variable heavy chain to a Cys residue (TGC). The mutagenesis product was digested with methylation sensitive enzyme Dpn I according to the kit protocol and transformed into the \nE. coli \nstrain XL10-GOLD® (Stratagene; La Jolla, Calif.). \nE. coli \ncolonies transformed to ampicillin drug resistance were screened for the correct sequence mutation by DNA sequence analysis. The resulting plasmid, pIEH004, was utilized for a subsequent reaction to mutate the Gln residue (CAG) at position 100 (Kabat numbering system) of BHA10 variable light chain to a Cys residue (TGC) using primer pairs VL100-F and VL100-R (Table 3). Forward (VH44-F) and reverse (VH44-R) primers mutate Gly (GGA) to a Cys (TGC) at V\nH \nposition 44 (TGC indicated by underlined sequence). Forward (VL100-F) and reverse (VL100-R) primers mutate Gln (CAG) to a Cys (TGC) at V\nL \nposition 100 (TGC indicated by underlined sequence).\n\n\nXL10-GOLD® \nE. coli \ncolonies transformed to ampicillin drug resistance were screened for the correct sequence mutation by DNA sequence analysis and plasmid pIEH006 was identified as containing the double cysteine mutations at positions VH44 and \nV\n \n \n \nL\n100.

Construction of BHA10 scFv with Alternative (Gly\n4\nSer)\nn \nLinkers\n\n\nPlasmid pIEH003 encoding huBHA10 scFv with the conventional (Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinker was modified to contain a (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nor (Gly\n4\nSer)\n5 \nlinker by PCR amplification using the oligonucleotide primers described in Table 4.\n\n\nBHA10 scFv (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nwas assembled using a \nforward\n 5′ PCR primer designated pXWU002-F1 and a \nreverse\n 3′ PCR primer designated XWU002-R. The 5′ VH PCR primer XW002-F1 included a Btg I restriction endonuclease site (underlined sequence) located at the carboxyl terminus of BHA10 VH followed by sequence encoding a (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker. The 3′ VL PCR primer XW002-R included an Xba I site and a partial Enterokinase site. The partial BHA10 VH+(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker+the BHA10 VL regions were amplified in a PCR reaction using the XW002-F1/XW002-R PCR primer set from plasmid DNA pIEH003 (described in Example 1). The partial BHA10 scFv-(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker gene fragment corresponding to the expected size was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, excised, and purified using the Millipore Ultrafree-DA extraction kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Millipore; Bedford, Mass.). The purified PCR product was digested and cloned into the Btg I/Xba I digested pIEH003 vector resulting in plasmid pXWU002 encoding BHA10 scFv containing a (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker. BHA10 scFv containing the (Gly\n4\nSer)\n5 \nlinker was constructed in similar fashion using PCR primers XW003-F and XW002-R to produce plasmid pXWU003. Forward 5′ PCR primer (XWU003-F) contained a Btg I site (underlined sequence) followed by sequence encoding a few amino acid of the carboxyl terminus of BHA10 VH and sequence encoding a partial (Gly\n4\nSer)\n5 \nlinker. Correct sequences were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. DNA and amino acid sequences of BHA10 scFv containing the (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker are shown in \nFIGS. 4A and 4B\n, respectively.

Expression and Western Blot Analysis of Engineered BHA10 scFvs\n\n\nFor expression of engineered BHA10 scFvs, \nE. coli \nstrain W3110 (ATCC, Manassas, Va. Cat. #27325) was transformed with plasmids pIEH003, pXWU002, pXWU003 and pIEH006 and ampicillin resistant colonies selected and grown in 10 ml SB media (Teknova, Half Moon Bay, Ca. Cat. #S0140) containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin in a 50 ml conical centrifuge tube to OD\n600\n≅0.8, induced by adding to 0.02% arabinose, and cultured overnight. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and the pellets resuspended in 1/20 volume of an ice-cold iso-osmotic solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 20% sucrose (w/v) and chilled on ice. Equal volume of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, and 20% sucrose (w/v) containing 2 mg/ml Lysozyme (Sigma) was added to the bacterial suspension and incubated on ice with occasional mixing for 10 minutes. The bacterial suspension was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 8000×g, 4° C. and the periplasmic fraction retained.\n\n\nSamples were mixed with native sample buffer or sample buffer containing the reducing agent dithiothreitol and heated at 90° C. for 3 minutes. Reduced and non-reduced samples were electrophoresed on an SDS-PAGE Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.). The membrane was blocked with PBS containing 5% (w/v) non-fat milk and 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with an anti-human kappa antibody (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Ind.). The membrane was washed and then incubated with an anti-rabbit HRP antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Immune complexes were detected using the ECL Western Blotting Analysis System according to the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.).\n\n\nIt was found that one of three disulfide pairs tested, namely V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100, produced suitable amounts of protein when expressed in \nE. coli \n(\nFIG. 6\n, lane 2). (The V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL \n105 and V\nH\n106:\nV\n \n \n \nL \n43 disulfides tested did not produce as much intact scFv). Similarly, extending the length of the (Gly\n4\nSer)\nn \n(SEQ ID NO: 160) linker to n=4 (lane 3) or n=5 (not shown) also produced suitable amounts of protein in \nE. coli\n. Combining both the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 and (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker modifications into BHA10 scFv using the methods described in Example 3 also led to suitable amounts of expressed protein (\nFIG. 6\n, lane 4). DNA and amino acid sequences of BHA10 scFv containing the combination of V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 and (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker modifications are shown in \nFIGS. 7A and 7B\n, respectively. In both cases where the BHA10 scFv contains the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 mutations, the scFvs were found to migrate with increased mobility in the denaturing, non-reducing polyacrylamide gel, yet migrated similarly to conventional BHA10 scFv under denaturing, reducing conditions (\nFIG. 6\n, \nlanes\n 2 and 4). This analysis suggests that the BHA10 scFv variants containing the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 mutations are likely forming intact disulfide bonds and may be attaining a more compact structure.\n\n\nB. Thermal Denaturation Assay.\n\n\nThe activities of the conventional and engineered BHA10 scFvs were then compared in a thermal challenge assay which can be used to determine the temperature at which 50% of scFv molecules retain their antigen binding activity following a thermal challenge event. The numerical value corresponding to this temperature is referred to as the “T\n50\n” value and the units are in ° C. In this assay, the scFvs were subjected to a range of temperatures that encompass the thermal transition temperature of conventional BHA10 scFv.\n\n\n \nE. coli \nstrain W3110 (ATCC, Manassas, Va. Cat. #27325) was transformed with plasmids encoding the conventional and engineered BHA10 scFvs under the control of an inducible ara C promoter. Transformants were grown overnight in expression media consisting of SB (Teknova, Half Moon Bay, Ca. Cat. #S0140) supplemented with 1% glycine, 1% Triton X100, 0.02% arabinose, and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at either 37° C. or 32° C. Bacteria was pelleted by centrifugation and supernatants harvested for further treatment. Including glycine and Triton X-100 in the media results in the release of periplasmic contents (native \nE. coli \nprotein and scFv) into the media (Yang et al. Applied and Enviromental Microbiology. (1998) 64:2869-2874). The presence of \nE. coli \nproteins in the supernatant is essential to the performance of this assay because the thermally denatured proteins act as a “sink”, trapping transiently unfolded scFv molecules into irreversible inactive aggregates.\n\n\nEach library was screened in duplicate using a thermal challenge assay with supernatant from one replicate subjected to treatment conditions and the second supernatant serving as untreated reference. Thermal denaturation assays can be run at a single or range of temperatures for measuring stability. Thermocycler machines capable of generating stable thermal gradients were used for treating sample supernatants (iCycler, Bio-Rad, Gaithersburg, Md.).\n\n\nThe challenge temperature varied depending on the properties of the parental BHA10 scFv variant and was generally two to three degrees Celsius higher than the experimentally determined T\n50 \nvalue. Frozen Master plates were thawed and used to inoculate deep-well microtiter plates containing 250 μl of expression media per well, and cultures grown overnight at 32° C. As a control, cultures containing the parental plasmid were grown under the same conditions and processed simultaneously as the library. Bacteria were pelleted and 50-100 μl aliquots of test supernatant were placed in either PCR strip tubes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., Cat. #N801-535) or 96-well plates (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., Cat. #N801-560) and the samples were heated for 60-90 minutes. Samples were transferred to 96-well v-bottomed plates (Corning, Corning, N.Y., Cat. #3357) and centrifuged in a refrigerated clinical centrifuge (IEC model 8R, Thermo Electron, Waltham, Ma) for 30 minutes, and 100 μl of the supernatant was transferred to standard microtiter plates (Corning, Corning, N.Y., Cat. #3357). An aliquot of the supernatant was reserved for the reference DELFIA. For most libraries, the plates containing the remainder of the supernatants were sealed (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, N.Y., Cat. #235205) and placed in an incubator set to the appropriate challenge temperature (Echo Therm, Torrey Pines Scientific, San Marcos, Calif.) for 90 minutes. For screens requiring multiple challenge temperatures (or for temperatures greater than 75° C.) the supernatants were transferred to 96-well PCR plates (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., Cat. #N801-560) and incubated for 90 minutes at the desired temperature.\n\n\nAfter thermal challenge, the samples were centrifuged at 2,000 RPM to remove aggregated material. Soluble BHA10 scFv samples remaining in the treated, cleared supernatant were assayed for binding to cognate LTβR Ig antigen by DELFIA assay. 96-well plates (MaxiSorp, Nalge Nunc, Rochester, N.Y., Cat. #437111) were coated with fusion protein consisting of the ectodomain of the LTβ receptor (LTβR) fused to a human Fc region at 1 μg/ml in 0.1M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5. Plates were coated overnight at 4° C., and blocked with DELFIA assay buffer (DAB, 10 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 20 μM EDTA, 0.5% BSA, 0.02\n% Tween\n 20, 0.01% NaN\n3\n, pH 7.4) for one hour with shaking at room temperature. Plates were washed 3 times with DAB without BSA (Wash buffer), and test samples diluted in DAB were added to the plates in a final volume of 100 μl. The plates were incubated for one hour with shaking at room temperature, and then washed 3 times with Wash buffer to remove unbound and functionally inactivated scFv molecules. Bound BHA10 scFv was detected by addition of 100 μl per well of DAB containing 40 ng/ml of Eu-labeled anti-His\n6 \nantibody (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass., Cat. #AD0109) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for one hour. The plates were washed 3 times with Wash buffer, and 100 μl of DELFIA enhancement solution (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass., Cat. #4001-0010) was added per well. Following incubation for 15 minutes, the plates were read using the Europium method on a Victor 2 (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.).\n\n\nAssay data was processed using Spotfire DecisionSite software (Spotfire, Somerville, Mass.) and expressed as the ratio of the DELFIA counts observed at challenge temperature to the reference temperature for each clone. Clones that reproducibly gave ratios greater than or equal to twice what was observed for the parental plasmid were considered hits. Plasmid DNAs from these positive clones were isolated by mini-prep (Wizard Plus, Promega, Madison, Wis.) and retransformed back into \nE. coli \nW3110 for confirmation secondary thermal challenge assays.\n\n\nFor thermal gradients, the data was analyzed using \nPrism\n 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.) using a sigmoidal dose response with variable slope as the model. The values obtained for the mid-point of the thermal denaturation curves are referred to as T\n50 \nvalues, and are not construed as being equivalent to biophysically derived Tm values.\n\n\nThe results of the thermal challenge assay are depicted in \nFIG. 8\n. As depicted in \nFIG. 8\n, all of the stabilized scFv molecules of the invention resulted in improvements in binding activity (T\n50\n>49° C.) as compared with the conventional scFv. In particular, the T\n50 \nvalues of BHA10 \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nL\n46 scFv (S46L), \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n16 scFv (S16E and S16Q), and library positions V\nL\n49: \nV\n \n \n \nL\n50 scFv exhibited increases in thermal stability ranging from +3° C. to +12° C. relative to the conventional BHA10 scFv. In addition, the T\n50 \nvalues of BHA10 \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nL\n3 scFv (Q3A, Q3G, Q3S, Q3V, and Q3D), \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n67 scFv (V671 and V67L), library position VH48 scFv (M48I and M48G), \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n20 scFv (V201) and \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n101 scFv (P101D) exhibited increases in thermal stability ranging from +4° C. to +18° C. relative to the conventional BHA10 scFv. One of the stabilizing mutations (V\nL \nK13E) serendipitously resulted from a PCR error. Incorporation of one of these stabilizing mutations into pIEH009 was found to further improve thermal stability and even exceed that of BHA10 Fab under these conditions. Importantly, the \nnon-covalent V\n \n \n \nL\n46, \nV\n \n \n \nH\n101 mutation, and VH55 mutations derived from one or more of the four design methods (V\nL\n/V\nH \ninterface homology modeling, consensus scoring, computational modeling, and covariation analysis) resulted in an improvement in scFv thermal stability nearly approaching that observed with the disulfide mutations and validating the utility and novelty of these design tools. In particular, the T\n50 \nof the pIEH006 construct, BHA10 V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 scFv (59° C.), differed from BHA10 Fab (62° C.) by only 3° C., while the pIEH009 construct, BHA10 scFv V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker, was found to be functionally equivalent to BHA10Fab under these conditions. These results demonstate that the stabilized scFvs of the invention have improved activity following a thermal challenge event.\n\n\nc. Affinity Measurements\n\n\nIsothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to measure the affinity of sLTβR to the BHA10 Fab derived using enzymatic cleavage of the BHA10 IgG1 molecule. sLTβR was prepared as described previously (Eldredge et al., \nBiochemistry\n, (2006)). The Fab and sLTβR were concentrated to 6.0 and 2.0 mg/mL, respectively, using Amicon ultracentrifugal filter devices (MWCO 10,000). The concentrated stock solutions were simultaneously dialyzed against PBS prior to the ITC measurements. ITC was performed on a VP-ITC unit (MicroCal LLC, Northampton, Mass.) set to 30° C. Approximately 500 μL of a 7 μM sLTβR solution was placed into the sample cell and PBS dialysate was placed in the reference cell. A total of 234 μL of 70 μM BHA10 Fab was titrated into the sample cell in 7×10 μL, 12×7 μL, followed by 8×10 μL injections. The reaction stoichiometry was 1:1. ITC curves were analysed using the Origin Software supplied by the manufacturer.\n\n\nK\nD \nmeasurements of conventional BHA10 scFv, BHA10 (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv, and BHA10 V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv preparations as described in Examples 3 and expressed and purified using the methods described in Example 1 were performed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on a \nBiacore\n 3000 instrument (Biacore Inc., Piscataway, N.J.). All experiments were performed in HBS-EP buffer, pH 7.4. Biotinylated PENTA-His (SEQ ID NO: 159) antibody (20 μg/mL, Cat#34440, Qiagen) was immobilized onto a streptavidin-coated CM5 chip at a flow rate of 10 μl/min for approximately 1 minute. 0.1 μM solutions of test scFvs were injected over the chip at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 10 minutes and captured onto the surface via the immobilized PENTA-His antibody. To investigate binding between sLTIβR and captured scFv, a concentration series of sLTβR (1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 nM) was double injected at a flow rate of 30 μl/min onto the scFv-coated surface. Background was subtracted from test sample sensorgrams using sensorgram data from a flow cell containing buffer only and sensorgram data from the PENTA-His surface where scFv was injected followed by an injection of buffer instead of sLTfβR. The curves were analyzed using the BiaEval 3.0 manufacturer's software. K\nD \nvalues were calculated by fitting kinetic association and dissociation curves to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. Chip surfaces were regenerated by two consecutive 10 μL injections of 0.1 M glycine, pH 3.0.\n\n\nTable 5 shows the results of the Biacore affinity assay. The binding affinity of recombinantly produced BHA10 scFv is essentially the same as the BHA10 Fab prepared as described in Example 1. Additionally, introduction of the (G\n4\nS)\n4 \nlinker alone or in the presence of the stabilizing disulfide (V\nH\n44:V\nL\n100), or the combination of the two did not result in any significant loss of affinity towards antigen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiacore affinity assay-binding to LTβR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nConstruct\n\n\nKd (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBHA10 scFv\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBHA10 (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBHA10 V\nH\n44: \nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv\n\n\n4.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBHA10 Fab (CHO)\n\n\n1.9 ± 1.0*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*Measured by isothermal titration calorimetry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD. Differential Scanning Calorimetry Studies\n\n\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analyses were performed with BHA10 scFv, BHA10 (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv, and BHA10 V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv preparations. Experiments were performed as described above for the initial comparisons of the conventional scFv against the enzymatically produced Fab except they were performed at a scan rate of 4° C./min. BHA10 V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv demonstrated superior thermostability properties compared to the wild-type scFv. In particular, the less stable of the two domains, the V\nH \ndomain of BHA10 V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv, denatured at approximately 5° C. higher than that of conventional BHA10 scFv (\nFIG. 9\n). Increases in the “melting temperature” or T\nM \ncould be due to two separate factors, (i) an increase in the thermostability of the equilibrium folded state or (ii) a decreased tendency to aggregate. The ˜5° C. temperature difference between the conventional BHA10 scFv and BHA10 V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv was relatively independent of scan rate (between 0.2 and 4.0° C./min) suggesting the observed T\nM \nchange was due to stabilization of the equilibrium folded state.\n\n\nE. ANS Binding Studies\n\n\nThe ability to bind the hydrophobic fluorescent dye 1-anilino-8-naphthaline sulfonate (ANS) is often a hallmark of interactions with significantly large hydrophobic regions either in a protein's native state or partially unfolded state that can occur upon increased treatment with temperature. The intrinsic fluorescence of the dye is quenched in solvent and significantly increases when exposed to large hydrophobic surface areas. The conventional BHA10 scFv intrinsically bound ANS at a much stronger level than the BHA10 (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv, or BHA10 V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFv indicating the presence of hydrophobic exposure forced upon the scFv by an inadequately sized linker. Addition of the longer linker, specifically (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4\n, appeared to mediate this effect. The apparent exposure of a hydrophobic surface by the conventional BHA10 scFv may lead to an increased level of aggregation in the presence of other proteins or molecules, or even in the presence of itself in isolation. Heating BHA10 scFv above its T\nM \nappeared to induce ANS binding for the conventional and engineered BHA10 scFvs. Interestingly, the conventional BHA10 scFv showed a gradual increase in ANS binding, as a function of increasing temperature, suggesting possible increases in hydrophobic exposure at temperatures below the T\nM\n—such as temperatures used in bacterial and mammalian cell culture (i.e. 37° C.) (\nFIG. 10\n). In contrast, both BHA10 (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nand BHA10 V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nscFvs did not exhibit this property suggesting that the stabilizing mutations described in this invention decrease the tendency to self-associate or associate with other cell-culture protein components based on reduced exposure of hydrophobic surface areas.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nIdentification of Stabilizing Mutations which Confer Improved Intrinsic Protein Stability\n\n\n(i) Identification of Stabilizing Mutations\n\n\nA variety of sequence-based methods (e.g., consensus scoring, covariation analysis, VH/VL interface homology modeling) were used to identify stabilizing mutations which conferred improved protein stability to binding molecules of interest. These stabilizing mutations were used in the design and construction of antibody variable region expression libraries.\n\n\nA. Covariation Analysis\n\n\nA number of designs were developed for stabilizing the BHA10 scFv V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains based on the strong covariation exhibited by two or more residues within a single sequence. Covariation analysis was performed on the BHA10 scFv V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains using methods similar to those described in Example 17 infra in order to identify missing or violative covariations such that stabilizing mutations could be predicted and included in an antibody variable region expression library for experimental screening.\n\n\nIn a first example, mutation from Ser to Leu at position 46 (S46L; Kabat numbering system) within the BHA10 V\nL \nexhibited a positive connection to an existing Tyr at \nresidue\n 36 which the Covariation Analysis Tool showed to covary strongly with Leu 46 (see \nFIG. 78\n). This mutation was also predicted to be stabilizing by residue frequency analysis.\n\n\nIn addition to S46L, a second mutation predicted by covariation to be stabilizing was a V55G mutation within the BHA10 V\nH \ndomain. While residue frequency indicated that Val is infrequently observed at this position, this position is embedded within CDR2 and is variable. Therefore, without additional information, no changes at this position were previously attempted. Upon inspection by covariation analysis, however, the covariation data suggested that this position was strongly correlated with at least 10 other amino acids that already exist within the BHA10 V\nH \ndomain. Mutation to Gly at \nposition\n 55 satisfied all 10 covariations.\n\n\nAnother example of the utility of the Covariation Analysis Tool was the predicted negative effect of a BHA10 V\nH \nQ6E mutation. Single residue frequency analysis suggested that mutation to the much more commonly observed Glu at this position would lead to an increase in stability. However, the Covariation Analysis Tool indicated that single mutation to Glu violates several existing covariations present within the BHA10 V\nH \nsequence. To obtain an improvement in stability, one must replace several amino acids that preferentially stabilize Glu at this position.\n\n\nYet, another example of the predictive value of the Covariation Analysis Tool is shown in \nFIG. 79\n. \nMet\n 80 was mutated to Leu as part of a single residue library design. It was thought that this single mutation would be highly stabilizing, as Leu is the most frequent amino acid observed at this position within the sequence database. However, covariation analyses indicate that two other amino acids must be mutated (V67F and T70S) in order to achieve covariation harmony.\n\n\nB. Consensus Scoring\n\n\nConsensus scoring was utilized as a method for identifying amino acid residues within the scFv V\nH \nand V\nL \nregions for mutagenesis to improve the intrinsic stability of the scFv. The scoring assesses the relative drift from consensus V\nH \nand V\nκ \nsequences due to hypersomatic mutations and evolutionary germline variations. Information derived from this analysis was then used to design a library to screen for scFv variants with improved stability.\n\n\nThe reference set of mammalian V\nH \nand V\nκ\n kappa sequences used to derive the consensus sequence for scoring and the individual amino acid frequencies at each residue position were collected, sorted, and culled as described previously (Demarest, et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n335, 41-48 (2004); Demarest, et al., \nProtein Eng. Des. Sel. In Press\n, (2006). The mammalian reference sets were naively constructed to include V-genes from various mammals in order to obtain diversity via the evolutionary drift between species. The V\nH \nmammalian reference set contains 61 V\nH \nsequences primarily from NCBI and TIGR representing a total of 17 different mammalian species. The V\nκ\n mammalian reference set contains 53 V\nκ\n sequences from 13 different mammalian species.\n\n\nStatistical analysis of the BHA10 V\nH \nand V\nL \nwere performed using custom designed IgG databases and a modified PERL script (Demarest et al., 2004; Demarest et al., 2006). The amino acid frequency of every residue within the BHA10 V\nH \nand V\nL \nwas calculated from the custom database. The residue frequency of each amino acid within the BHA10V\nH \nand V\nL\n, S\ni\n(r), for each position, i, in an individual sequence was calculated by the number of times that particular residue-type (r=A, C, D . . . V, W, Y) is observed within the data set divided by the total number of sequences. \nFIG. 11\n shows the BHA10 V\nH \nand V\nL \nresidue frequencies divided by the residue frequency of the database consensus residues. By dividing by the consensus residue frequency, a stringent cutoff for the creation of libraries at residue positions where the BHA10 amino acid is infrequently observed among common V\nH \nor V\nL \nsequences is obtained. Library positions were determined by those whose residue frequency divided by the most frequent residue frequency (S\ni\n(r)/MFR\ni\n(r)) was <0.3. The residues listed to the right of the residue frequency calculations are those commonly found in human sequences as published (Chothia, et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n278, 457-479, (1998)) and can be specifically targeted in a library format to screen for the most stabilizing amino acid. The CDRs of the BHA10 V\nH \nand V\nL \nwere not considered for stability optimization due to potential interruption of the interaction with LTβR, but could be considered for second-generation designs.\n\n\nC. VH/VL Interface Homology Modeling\n\n\nAs described in Example 15 infra, differential scanning calorimetry analyses were performed on 17 human antibodies. The top candidates, BIIB1-4 all had exquisite (i.e., very high and desired) stability properties. These highly stable antibodies may be used as a platform for improving the stability of scFvs or antibody domains with low intrinsic stability. In particular, emphasis was placed on the interface between V\nH \nand V\nL \nto provide a potentially greater level of stability properties.\n\n\nConverting the BHA10 Fab to an scFv format resulted in a change in the DSC thermogram indicative of a fully cooperative unfolding event, as observed by a single, higher temperature unfolding transition (Fab), to a largely non-cooperative unfolding event, as observed by two individual, lower temperature unfolding transitions (scFv). In other words, in the Fab format, the interdomain contacts were strong enough to lock all the domains together into a single, higher temperature unfolding transition. Once the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and C\nL \ndomains were removed, the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of the scFv no longer had the ability to drive the unfolding transition into a cooperative event. It is postulated that by stabilizing the interface, on may not only stabilize both the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains simultaneously, but also promote the adherence of the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninterface and preclude aggregation.\n\n\nThe top 4 most stable BIIB antibodies (BIIB1-4) were used to design stabilizing mutations into the BHA10 scFv via a two-step procedure. First, a crystal structure of the humanized BHA10 Fab was utilized for structural analysis. Specifically, the crystal structure was employed to identify all the residues at the interface between V\nH \nand V\nL \nas well as the amount of surface area that each residue contributes to the interface (using MOLMOL software). The residues that bury significantly more surface area than others at the interface are considered to be more crucial to the interface. As an arbitrary limit prioritization, those that bury between 30 and 40 Å\n2 \nare considered important. Those that bury >40 Å\n2 \nare considered crucial. These two categories were given the highest priority in terms of homology modeling and mutagenesis. The amount of surface area each residue buries at the interface is listed in Table 6. Secondly, the amino acid types at the interface between V\nH \nand V\nL \nwere compared with the amino acids that exist at the same positions in BIIB1-4 (i.e. the extremely stable antibodies). This method allowed identification of a number of outstanding mutations for stabilizing the BHA10 scFv.\n\n\nTwo mutations, S46L in the V\nL \nand P101D in the V\nH \nwere experimentally validated as described in Example 8. In fact, these two mutations were the single most stabilizing mutations tested in the thermal challenge assay (e.g., see \nFIG. 50A\n and \nFIG. 50C\n). Both mutations stabilize both V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains simultaneously, suggesting that they help to build cooperativity among the domains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBHA10 V\nH\nV\nL \nSurface Area Analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition of\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nResidue\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH/VL\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterface\n\n\n \n\n\nBHA10 AA\n\n\nBuried\n\n\nwithin\n\n\nCorresponding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidue\n\n\n \n\n\nType\n\n\nSurface Area\n\n\nmammalian\n\n\nAA from Stable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Kabat #)\n\n\nRegion\n\n\n(Kabat)\n\n\n(Å\n2\n)\n\n\ndatabase\n\n\nAb (BIIB)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 35\n\n\nFR2\n\n\nHis\n\n\n16.4\n\n\n \n\n\nHis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 37\n\n\nFR2\n\n\nVal\n\n\n6.5\n\n\n \n\n\nVal\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 39\n\n\nFR2\n\n\nGln\n\n\n37.4\n\n\n98%\n\n\nGln\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 44\n\n\nFR2\n\n\nGly\n\n\n13.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 45\n\n\nFR2\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n97.8\n\n\n97%\n\n\nLeu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 47\n\n\nCDR2\n\n\nTrp\n\n\n78.5\n\n\n97%\n\n\nTrp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 50\n\n\nCDR2\n\n\nTrp\n\n\n24.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 59\n\n\nCDR2\n\n\nGln\n\n\n28.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 61\n\n\nCDR2\n\n\nAsn\n\n\n26.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 90\n\n\nFR3\n\n\nTyr\n\n\n37.3\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 100I\n\n\nCDR3\n\n\nGlu\n\n\n101.8\n\n\nHighly Variable\n\n\nGly (BIIB1), Tyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(BIIB2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 100J\n\n\nCDR3\n\n\nGly\n\n\n36.4\n\n\nAla, Gly (MCR);\n\n\nPhe (BIIB1),\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTyr (uncommon);\n\n\nAla (BIIB2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 100K\n\n\nCDR3\n\n\nPhe\n\n\n66.7\n\n\nMet (MCR); Phe\n\n\nPhe (BIIB1);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(SMCR)\n\n\nMet (BIIB2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH 101\n\n\nCDR3\n\n\nPro\n\n\n43.3\n\n\nAsp (V.

Computational Analysis\n\n\nComputational methods were used to analyze BHA10 for making recommendations on positions whereby amino acid substitutions might improve stability. These methods were composed of two steps: sequence-based analysis (step 1); and structure-based analysis (step 2). During the first step, a database of sequences of variable domains of antibodies was used. Amino acids present in low frequencies in their respective positions (less than in 10% of database sequences) or those that did not match the corresponding consensus amino acid were selected for substitutions to high-frequency or consensus amino acids (candidate mutations). During the second step a three-dimensional structure or model of an Fab fragment of the antibody was used. The candidate mutations were evaluated in their structural context and were prioritized for experimental testing based on structural properties, compatibility with complementarity determining regions (CDRs) conformations, role in V\nL\n/V\nH \ninterface packing, and folding of heavy and light chains.\n\n\nBHA10 is unusual in having a serine in \nposition\n 46 on the light chain. In the database, approximately 1% of V\nL \n(kappa subtype) sequences possess S46, whereas approximately 79% of V\nL \n(kappa subtype) sequences have L46. Also, human consensus KV1 has L46. Once identified as a candidate mutation, S46L substitution was evaluated in the context of a three-dimensional model of BHA1 Fab. \nPosition\n 46 was found to reside at the V\nL\n/V\nH \ninterface making contacts with Y101 and W103 of V\nH \nand Y36 and Y55 of V\nL\n. Structure-base analysis revealed that S46L substitution was compatible with the integrity V\nL\n/V\nH \ninterface, CDR conformations, and V\nL \nfolding.\n\n\nSerine is an infrequent amino acid at \nposition\n 16 of the heavy chain. In the database, approximately 5% of V\nH \nsequences possess S16, 25% have A16, 21% have G16, 11% have E16, and approximately 10% are Q16. Also human consensus HV1 has A16. Once identified as candidate mutations, S16A, G, E, and Q substitutions were evaluated in the context of three-dimensional model of BHA10 Fab. \nPosition\n 16 was found to reside in the loop proximal to the V\nH\n/\nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 interface making contacts with K13 and S16 of V\nH\n. Structure-base analysis revealed that S16A, G, E, and Q substitutions were compatible with the integrity of the V\nL\n/V\nH \ninterface, CDR conformations, and V\nH \nfolding. Also it was concluded that long hydrophilic sidechains of E16 and Q16 would be preferred. Accordingly, positions \nV\n \n \n \nL \n46 and \nV\n \n \n \nH \n16 were represented in the library design.\n\n\nA complementary approach to computational analysis made use of structure-based protein engineering techniques, such as Rosetta (Kuhlman B. et al., PNAS 200198(19):10687-91) and DEEK (Hanf K. J., Ph.D. Thesis, MIT, 2002). Given a three dimensional structure of a protein interface, these methods can yield mutations in amino acid sequence that lead to improved ΔΔG for VH to VL binding (difference between bound and unbound states) and/or ΔΔG for VH and VL folding (difference between folded and reference unfolded states). Use of these methods revealed that S46L is a mutation that improves VH to VL binding, whereas S16E is a mutation that improves folding of the VH.\n\n\nE. Combined Interface and Covariation Design Approaches\n\n\nCovariation analysis was used to determine residue networks important for providing and supporting the interface between VH and VL and maintaining a strong affinity between V\nH\n/V\nL\n, thereby resulting in increased scFv stability. Residues directly involved in the interface between VH and VL of the BHA10 scFv were identified as described in Example 5C and are listed in Table 6 supra. Residues that covary strongly with the most highly buried residues listed in Table 6 supra were calculated using the covariation methodology described in Section III (a) supra. The HMM used for covariation analysis eliminates the ability to investigate residues in CDR2 and CDR3 of both the VH and VL domains that are buried at the interface. Nevertheless, it is believed that no strong covariations would arise from these residue positions as they are highly variable due to intense selective pressures that exist for antibodies to be able to recognize antigens with high affinity. Therefore, the residues that were used for determining whether a covariation network exists for supporting the interface between both VH and VL were:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVH (kabat#)\n\n\nVL (kabat#)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nV37/I37\n\n\nY36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQ39\n\n\nQ38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG44\n\n\nA43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nL45\n\n\nP44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nW47\n\n\nL46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nW50\n\n\nY49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nY91\n\n\nY95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nW103\n\n\nF98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidues whose appearance in the V-class sequence alignment correlated with the interface residues listed above were determined using a phi-value cutoff>0.25. No residue was considered as important for maintaining a strong interface between VH and VL if it was not correlated with at least 2 of the interface residues listed directly above. Tables 7 and 8 list those residues within the VH and VL domains, respectively, that demonstrate 2 or more correlations with interface residues. The larger the number of links, the greater the impact each of these amino acid positions is conceived to have for stabilizing the interface between VH and VL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE

interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Q50, A89, Y135 are conserved in both heavy and light chains and covariations do not appear to correlate with light chain positions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe residues from Tables 7 and 8 have been mapped to the surfaces of the BHA10 VH and VL, respectively, and compared with the actual residues that make direct contact at the interface between the two domains (see \nFIGS. 87 and 88\n). Two supported from this analysis. First, covariations do not provide information (at this stage) about networks involving CDR2 and CDR3 residues at the interface. Second, covariations suggest that not only are residues that make direct contacts within the interface important for its maintenance, but that many other residues outside the direct interface residues are important for scaffolding and supporting the positions of the interface residues. This point is illustrated by those residues that are illustrated on the surface of the covariation network but are absent on the surface obtained simply using the structures to calculate those residues that directly bury surface at the interface.\n\n\nViolations of a few of these interface covariation networks were found to exist within the BHA10 or p5E8 (described below in Example 21) scFvs: VH or VL sequences. Mutation of the native/non-ideal amino acids at these positions to the ideally supportive interface amino acid residues described in Tables 7 and 8 were shown to be highly stabilizing to either the BHA10 or p5E8 scFvs: (a) BHA10 VL S46L, and (b) Idec152 VH S49G (kabat and Xray#)\n\n\nE72D (73 for Xray). One of these residues (S46L\nVL\n) was directly at the interface, one (S49G\nVH\n) was directly adjacent to the interface, and one was distal to the interface (E72D\nVH\n). However, all three were predicted based on Covariation Analysis to be stabilizing to the interface. Stabilization of the interface can be observed using DSC measurements as an increase in the thermal stability of both the V\nH \nand the V\nL\n.\n\n\nii) Construction and Screening of BHA10 scFv Libraries with Improved Thermal Stability\n\n\n\nA) Construction of scFv Libraries\n\n\nLibraries designed to contain the desired amino acid replacements in the conventional BHA10 scFv (pXWU002) using the methods described in Examples 4, 5, and 6 were created using the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit following instructions provided by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) using oligonucleotides listed in Table 9. The DNA sequence of the conventional scFv is depicted in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\nIndividual transformed colonies were picked into deep-well 96 well dishes (Corning, Corning, N.Y., Cat. #3960) containing 400 μl/well LB plus 50 mg/ml carbenicillin and grown overnight at 37° C. Master plates were created by adding an equal volume of LB containing 20% glycerol to each well of the deep-well 96 well dishes and transferring 50 μl aliquots of the bacterial suspension to sterile microtiter plates (Corning, Corning, N.Y., Cat. #3359) and freezing for storage at −80° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOligonucleotides for stability engineering of\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBHA10 scFv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBHA10\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary\n\n\n \n\n\nDesign\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition\n\n\nSequence†\n\n\nMethod(s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nL \n49 and 50\n\n\n5′-GTACCGGTAGGAGGC\nMNNR\n \n\n\nConsensus\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 123)\n\n\n \nKA\nAATCAGTGATTTAGG-3\n′\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nL \n46\n\n\n5′-\n\n\nConsensus,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 124)\n\n\nGGGAAGGCTCCTAAA\nTTA\nCTG\n\n\nComputation,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nATTTCCTCGGCC-3′\n\n\nV\nL\n/V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nInterface,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nCovariation\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nH \n16\n\n\n5′-\n\n\nConsensus,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 125)\n\n\nGGACACCTTCACTGA\nCBN\nCCC\n\n\nComputation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAGGCTTCTTCAC-3\n′\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nH \n101\n\n\n5′-\n\n\nV\nL\n/V\nH\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 126)\n\n\nGATCCTGGGAAGGTTTTGACT\n\n\nInterface,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nACTGGGGCCAAGGGAC-3\n′\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nH \n20\n\n\n5′-\n\n\nConsensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 127)\n\n\nGGGTCCTCAGTGAAGWTRTCC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTGCAAGGCTTCTG-3\n′\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nH \n48\n\n\n5′-\n\n\nConsensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 128)\n\n\nCAGGGACTTGAGTGGVKKGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTGGATTTATCCTG-3\n′\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nH \n67\n\n\n5′-\n\n\nConsensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 129)\n\n\nGAAGTTCAAGGGCAGGNYCA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCAATCACTGCAGAC-3\n′\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nH \n55\n\n\n5′-\n\n\nCovariation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 130)\n\n\nGGATGGATTTATCCTGGAAA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTGGTCATGCTCAGTACAATGA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nG-3\n′\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \nL \n3\n\n\n5′-\n\n\nConsensus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 131)\n\n\nGGTGGTAGTGACATTVNSATG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nACCCAGTCTCCTAGC-3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n†Positions targeted for mutagenesis are indicated by underline.

Thermal Challenge Assay\n\n\nThe activities of the conventional and engineered BHA10 scFvs were then compared in a thermal challenge assay which can be used to determine the temperature at which 50% of scFv molecules retain their antigen binding activity following a thermal challenge event. The numerical value corresponding to this temperature is referred to as the T\n50 \nvalue and the units are in ° C. In this assay, the scFvs were subjected to a range of temperatures that encompass the thermal transition temperature of conventional BHA10 scFv.\n\n\n \nE. coli \nstrain W3110 (ATCC, Manassas, Va. Cat. #27325) was transformed with plasmids encoding conventional and engineered BHA10 scFvs under the control of an inducible ara C promoter. Transformants were grown overnight in expression media consisting of SB (Teknova, Half Moon Bay, Ca. Cat. #S0140) supplemented with 1% glycine, 1% Triton X100, 0.02% arabinose, and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at either 37° C. or 32° C. Bacteria was pelleted by centrifugation and supernatants harvested for further treatment. Including glycine and Triton X-100 in the media resulted in the release of periplasmic contents (native \nE. coli \nprotein and scFv) into the media. The presence of \nE. coli \nproteins in the supernatant is essential to the performance of this assay because the thermally denatured proteins act as a “sink”, trapping transiently unfolded scFv molecules into irreversible inactive aggregates.\n\n\nEach library was screened in duplicate using a thermal challenge assay with supernatant from one replicate subjected to treatment conditions and the second supernatant serving as untreated reference. Thermal challenge assays can be run at a single or range of temperatures for measuring stability. Thermocycler machines capable of generating stable thermal gradients are used for treating sample supernatants (iCycler, Bio-Rad, Gaithersburg, Md.).\n\n\nThe challenge temperature varied depending on the properties of the parental BHA10 scFv variant and was generally two to three degrees Celsius higher than the experimentally determined T\n50 \nvalue. Frozen Master plates were thawed and used to inoculate deep-well microtiter plates containing 250 μl of expression media per well, and cultures grown overnight at 32° C. As a control, cultures containing the parental plasmid were grown under the same conditions and processed simultaneously as the library. Bacteria were pelleted in the deep-well plates by centrifugation at 2000 rpm (IEC model 8R, Thermo Electron, Waltham, Mass.) for 30 minutes, and 100 μl of the supernatant was transferred to standard microtiter plates (Corning, Corning, N.Y., Cat. #3357). An aliquot of the supernatant was reserved for the reference DELFIA. For most libraries, the plates containing the remainder of the supernatants were sealed (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, N.Y., Cat. #235205) and placed in an incubator set to the appropriate challenge temperature (Echo Therm, Torrey Pines Scientific, San Marcos, Calif.) for 90 minutes. For screens requiring multiple challenge temperatures (or for temperatures greater than 75° C.) the supernatants were transferred to 96-well PCR plates (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., Cat. #N801-560) and incubated for 90 minutes at the desired temperature.\n\n\nAfter thermal challenge, the aggregated material was removed by centrifugation and soluble BHA10 scFv samples remaining in the treated, cleared supernatant were assayed for binding to cognate LTβR Ig antigen by DELFIA assay. 96-well plates (MaxiSorp, Nalge Nunc, Rochester, N.Y., Cat. #437111) were coated with fusion protein consisting of the ectodomain of the LTβ receptor (LTβR) fused to a human Fc region at 1 μg/ml in 0.1M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5. Plates were coated overnight at 4° C., and blocked with DELFIA assay buffer (DAB, 10 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 20 μM EDTA, 0.5% BSA, 0.02\n% Tween\n 20, 0.01% NaN\n3\n, pH 7.4) for one hour with shaking at room temperature. Plates were washed 3 times with DAB without BSA (Wash buffer), and test samples diluted in DAB were added to the plates in a final volume of 100 μl. The plates were incubated for one hour with shaking at room temperature, and then washed 3 times with Wash buffer to remove unbound and functionally inactivated scFv molecules. Bound BHA10 scFv was detected by addition of 100 μl per well of DAB containing 40 ng/ml of Eu-labeled anti-His\n6 \nantibody (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass., Cat. #AD0109) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for one hour. The plates were washed 3 times with Wash buffer, and 100 μl of DELFIA enhancement solution (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass., Cat. #4001-0010) was added per well. Following incubation for 15 minutes, the plates were read using the Europium method on a Victor 2 (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.).\n\n\nAssay data was processed using Spotfire DecisionSite software (Spotfire, Somerville, Mass.) and expressed as the ratio of the DELFIA counts observed at challenge temperature to the reference temperature for each clone. Clones that reproducibly gave ratios greater than or equal to twice what was observed for the parental plasmid were considered hits. Plasmid DNAs from these positive clones were isolated by mini-prep (Wizard Plus, Promega, Madison, Wis.) and retransformed back into \nE. coli \nW3110 for confirmation secondary thermal challenge assays.\n\n\nFor thermal gradients, the data was analyzed using \nPrism\n 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.) using a sigmoidal dose response with variable slope as the model. The values obtained for the mid-point of the thermal denaturation curves are referred to as T\n50 \nvalues, and are not construed as being equivalent to biophysically derived Tm values.\n\n\nPrimary and confirmatory results from these assays are shown in Table 10. Several of the stabilized scFv molecules of the invention resulted in improvements in binding activity (T\n50\n>49° C.) as compared with the conventional scFv. In particular, the T\n50 \nvalues of BHA10 \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nL\n46 scFv (S46L), \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n16 scFv (S16E and S16Q), and library positions V\nL\n49: \nV\n \n \n \nL\n50 scFv exhibited increases in thermal stability ranging from +3° C. to +12° C. relative to the conventional BHA10 scFv. stability ranging from +3° C. to +12° C. relative to the conventional BHA10 scFv. In addition, the T\n50 \nvalues of BHA10 \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nL\n3 scFv (Q3A, Q3G, Q3S, Q3V, and Q3D), \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n67 scFv (V67I and V67L), \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n48 scFv (M48I and M48G), \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n20 scFv (V20I) and \nlibrary position V\n \n \n \nH\n101 scFv (P101D) exhibited increases in thermal stability ranging from +4° C. to +18° C. relative to the conventional BHA10 scFv. One of the stabilizing mutations (V\nL \nK13E) serendipitously resulted from a PCR error. Incorporation of one of these stabilizing mutations into pIEH009 was found to further improve thermal stability and even exceed that of BHA10 Fab under these conditions (\nFIG. 12\n). Importantly, the \nnon-covalent V\n \n \n \nL\n46 mutation and \nV\n \n \n \nH\n55 mutations derived from one or more of the four design methods (V\nL\n/V\nH \ninterface homology modeling, consensus scoring, computational modeling, and covariation analysis) resulted in an improvement in scFv thermal stability nearly approaching that observed with the disulfide mutations and validating the utility and novelty of these design tools.\n\n\n \nFIG. 1B\n shows the amino acid sequences of conventional BHA10 scFv (SEQ ID NO: 4) and \nFIGS. 94A\n and B shows the amino acid sequence of stabilized BHA10 scFVs containing the S46L(VL) stabilizing mutation (SEQ ID NO: 137), and the V55G (VH) stabilizing mutation (SEQ ID NO: 138), respectively.

As depicted in \nFIGS. 50A\n and B, both of these mutations led to significant increases in the T\n50 \nof the BHA10 scFv. In particular, the VL_S46L mutation stabilizes the scFv by ˜7-8° C. while the VH_V55G mutation stabilizes the scFv by ˜12° C. Both of these mutations also significantly shrink the T\nM \ngap between V\nH \nand V\nL \nas determined by DSC (see \nFIG. 51\n). The DSC data shows that both mutations lead to significant increases in both the T\nM \n(midpoint of the thermal unfolding transitions) of both of the VH and VL domains and in the calorimetric enthalpy (i.e. area under the curve) for the scFv. Increases in these values provide experimental validation that these predicted stabilizing mutations are in fact stabilizing to the scFv. Furthermore, since these two mutations stabilize both V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains simultaneously, they are likely important in building cooperativity between the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains. Accordingly, it is expected that strengthening the interface between V\nH \nand V\nL \nmay not only help increase stability, but reduce the tendency to form aggregates as well.\n\n\nThe V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L stabilizing mutation and a third stabilizing mutation (VH\n—\n101 D) were also predicted to be stabilizing based on VH/VL interface homology modeling described in Example 4 supra. The VH_P 101D stabilizing mutation stabilized the scFv by ˜15° C. as measured by thermal challenge assay (\nFIG. 50C\n). In addition, DSC (see \nFIG. 52\n) shows that this stabilizing mutation leads to significant increases in T\nM \nboth of the VH and VL domains and in the calorimetric enthalpy, indicating that this mutation is also likely cooperatively stabilize the scFv as a whole via the VH/VL interface.\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\nBiophysical Characterization of Stabilized BHA10 scFvs Comprising Stabilizing Mutations\n\n\nV region gene sequences from various plasmids listed in Table 11 were subcloned into a modified \nE. coli \nexpression vector to drive recombinant protein expression under the control of an inducible ara C promoter. Variant BHA10 scFvs were expressed and purified using methods described above. An apparent cleavage site at the N-terminus of the V\nL \ndomain led to a low level of V\nL \nin most scFv preparations as judged by SDS-Page analysis (\nFIG. 53\n).\n\n\nThe hydrodynamic properties of each scFv were investigated by size exclusion HPLC (Agilent Technologies) with static light scattering and refractive index detectors (MiniDAWN/ReX, Wyatt Technology). Each scFv was found to be predominantly monomeric; however, a few of the scFvs, including the wild-type (unstabilized) scFv, exhibited a low level of dimeric material (Table 12). None of the purified scFvs had detectable levels of oligomers larger than dimer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEC/Light Scattering Results of scFvs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpressed\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYield\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% Larger\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample\n\n\n(mg/L)\na\n \n\n\n% Monomer\n\n\n% Dimer\n\n\nAggregates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT\n\n\nn.d.\nb\n \n\n\n87\n\n\n13\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGS4\n\n\n0.6 ± 0.1\n\n\n97\n\n\n 3\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n009 (ss)\n\n\nn.d.\n\n\n99\n\n\n \n \n1\nc\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n072 V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n85\n\n\n15\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n073 V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L + ss\n\n\n*0.15\n\n\n78\n\n\n22\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n074 V\nH\n \n \n—\n \nS16E\n\n\n2.4 ± 1.7\n\n\n94\n\n\n 6\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n075 V\nH\n \n \n—\n \nS16Q\n\n\n1.1 ± 0.5\n\n\n96\n\n\n 4\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n076 V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L +\n\n\n1.8 ± 0.4\n\n\n80\n\n\n20\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nH\n \n \n—\n \nS16E\n\n\n\n\n\n\n077 V\nH\n \n \n—\n \nP101D\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n93\n\n\n 7\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n078 V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L +\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n85\n\n\n15\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nH\n \n \n—\n \nS16Q\n\n\n\n\n\n\n079 V\nH\n \n \n—\n \nV55G\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n92\n\n\n 8\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n080 V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L +\n\n\n*0.21\n\n\n76\n\n\n24\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nH\n \n \n—\n \nS16E + ss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n087 V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L +\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n76\n\n\n24\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nH\n \n \n—\n \nS16E, V55G\n\n\n\n\n\n\n094 V\nL\n \n \n—\n \nS46L +\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n79\n\n\n21\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\nH\n \n \n—\n \nS16E,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV55G, P101D\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nProteins without standard error were expressed one time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nb\nn.d., not determined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nc\nThese values were determined AFTER preparative SEC was performed to reduce aggregates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ultimate goal of the experiment was to investigate whether the designed mutations enhance stability and lead to a lower propensity for aggregation. The thermostability of each scFv was assessed using two separate methods. First, thermal unfolding of the scFvs was analyzed using DSC (\nFIG. 54A\n). Secondly, the thermostability of each scFv was investigated by heating the proteins in the presence of a fluorescent hydrophobic dye, 1-anilino-8-sulfonate (ANS, \nFIG. 54B\n). ANS generally binds to partially unfolded proteins or heat-denatured proteins in compact unfolded states. Upon association with exposed hydrophobic surface areas, the fluorescence of ANS increases significantly presumably due to sequestration of the quenching affects of solvent.\n\n\nThe temperature dependent ANS curves were fitted to a two-state protein unfolding transition as described below. The buffer was PBS and the concentration of scFv used in every experiment was 750 nM. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a JASCO model 812 Circular Dichroism spectropolarimeter equipped with a peltier heating device and external water bath. Fluorescence was collected using an accessory containing a photomultiplier tube perpendicular to the light path. The accessory is equipped with an adjustable monochrometer set to 480 nm. The sensitivity was set to 600V. Heating was performed at a continuous rate of 120° C./min. The excitation monochrometer was set to 370 nm.\n\n\nThermal unfolding of every scFv in this study led to an increase in ANS fluorescence. The midpoint of thermal unfolding (i.e. the T\nM\n) of each scFv protein domain was determined using DSC by fitting each unfolding peak to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation using the Origin 7.0 software provided by the manufacturer (MicroCal, Inc). T\nM\ns were also derived using ANS fluorescence by incorporation of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation into the non-linear curve fitting routine in KaleighdaGraph™:\n\n\nΔ\nG\n \nU\n°(\nT\n)=Δ\nH\n \nU\n°(\nT\n)−\nTΔS\n \nU\n°(\nT\n),  (1)\n\n\nwhere ΔG\nU\n°(T) is the temperature-dependent change in Gibbs free energy upon unfolding, ΔH\nU\n°(T) is the enthalpy change associated with unfolding, and ΔS\nU\n°(T) is the entropy associated with unfolded.

Genet. \n16: 115-140, (1993); Myers et al., \nProtein Sci. \n4: 2138-2148 (1995)).\n\n\n\nThe thermostability measurements for all the scFvs derived from DSC and ANS-binding experiments were comparable. Unfolding of each scFv was irreversible; therefore, aggregation had an affect on the absolute T\nM \nmeasured by DSC or ANS-binding. Since the two techniques heated the samples differently and at different rates, the T\nM\ns were not expected to be identical across the experimental formats (Sánchez-Ruiz et al., \nBiochemistry, \n27:1648-1652 (1988)). However, the trend observed for each experimental technique was identical (see Table 13). The DSC experiments readily discriminated between the V\nH \nand V\nL \nunfolding transitions. The ANS-binding experiments were not capable of accurately discriminating 2 transitions (i.e. V\nH \nvs. V\nL \nunfolding); thus, only the apparent T\nM \nwas provided for the ANS-binding experiments. The apparent T\nM \nobserved by ANS-binding appeared to correlate well with the T\nM \nof the last domain to unfold, either V\nH \nor V\nL \ndepending on the mutation, as determined by DSC. Due to aggregation of unfolded material in both assay formats, the T\nM\ns were used as a guide to rank order the stability enhancements afforded by each mutation without additional interpretation of scFv free-energies of unfolding, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 13\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThermostability measurements of each scFv.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nV\nH \nT\nM\n \n \nV\nL \nT\nM\n \n \nV\nH \nT\nM\n \n \nscFv T\nM\n \n \nscFv K\nD \n(M) * 10\n−9\n \n \n \n \nConstruct\n \n(° C.

The rationale behind testing these positions for stability enhancements often came from multiple forms of analysis. Consensus methods predicted that all of the mutations V\nH \nS16E, S16Q, V55G, P101D and V\nL \nS46L would stabilize the BHA10 scFv (Example 3). However, V\nH \nV55G and P101D (incidentally, the two most stabilizing mutations) are positioned within CDR2 and CDR3 of V\nH\n, respectively, and were not considered for mutagenesis until further predictive evidence was compiled that suggested that mutation at these two positions could lead to stabilizing events. Both V\nH \nV55G and V\nL \nS46L were also predicted to be stabilizing based on Covariation Analyses. Finally, V\nH \nP101D and V\nL \nS46L were predicted to be potentially stabilizing to the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninterface based on the interface composition of highly stable human antibodies (Example 3).\n\n\nSingle mutations at the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninterface increased the stability of both domains, while V\nH \nmutations outside the interface only stabilized the V\nH \ndomain itself. V\nH \nS16E, S16Q, and V55 G were outside the interface and increased the apparent T\nM \nof the BHA10 V\nH \nby 3, 2, and 11° C., respectively. The V\nL \nstability was relatively unaffected by these mutations. V\nH \nV55G mutation appeared to increase the stability of the V\nH \nto match that of the V\nL \ndomain, without leading to detectable increases in V\nL \nstability. Both mutations at the interface, V\nH \nP101D and V\nL \nS46L significantly increased the stability of both domains. The P101D mutation in particular led to the fully cooperative unfolding of the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains suggesting that the interface and cooperativity of folding between V\nH \nand V\nL \nwas significantly strengthened. Thus, mutations at the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninterface may provide the most effective means of forming a stabilized Fv region and provide a rationale for prioritizing stability designs to the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninterface of scFvs over designs directed towards at residues outside the Fv interface.\n\n\nCombining V\nH \nmutations eventually led to a disconnect between the cooperativity of V\nH\n/V\nL \nunfolding (Table 13). As the V\nH \nT\nM \nclimbed above 75° C. (the result of combinations of V\nH \nmutations), the T\nM \nof the V\nL \nbegan to move towards lower temperatures. This suggests hyperstabilization of the V\nH \ndomain without building in compensating mutations within the V\nL \ndomain may lead to decreased folding cooperativity and a weakened interaction between the two domains. While the T\nM\ns of the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains (including the T\nM \nof the wild-type BHA10 scFv) were often quite different, evidence that mutations at the interface between the two domains could stabilize both domains simultaneously suggests that the two domains are interacting at some level with one another—although the apparent affinity between the isolated domains is not expected to be extremely high, except perhaps in the V\nH \nP101D stabilized variant (Brandts & Lin, \nBiochemistry, \n29:6927-6940, (1990)).\n\n\nIncreasing the stability of the scFv led to decreased intrinsic binding of the hydrophobic, fluorescent dye ANS at ambient temperature (15° C., \nFIG. 55\n). The wild-type scFv binds weakly to ANS suggesting that the protein may permanently or transiently expose hydrophobic surface area to solvent. Stabilized scFvs appeared to completely lose the ability to bind ANS under ambient conditions—the fluorescence of ANS in the presence of the most stabilized scFvs was no greater than that of ANS alone in solvent. Plots of V\nH\n \n \n—\n \nT\nM \n(measured by DSC or temperature-dependent ANS-binding experiments) vs. ANS-fluorescence in the presence of folded protein at 15° C. demonstrate that scFv-dependent ANS fluorescence decreases as scFv stability increases (\nFIG. 55\n). Reduction of ANS-binding by scFv stabilization may indicate that less hydrophobic surface area gets exposed to solvent and that stabilized scFvs may have a lower intrinsic propensity for aggregation.\n\n\nK\nD \nmeasurements of various individual and combined stabilizing BHA10 scFv mutations were performed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on a \nBiacore\n 3000 instrument. Table 13 shows the results of the Biacore affinity assay. The binding affinity of the variant BHA10 scFvs ranged from 1×-2.5× of the parent BHA10 scFv.\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nProduction of Stabilized Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies\n\n\nBoth conventional BHA10 scFv and the stabilized BHA10 scFvs of the invention were used to construct a panel of bispecific antibodies referred to as “Hercules”. Hercules bispecific antibodies comprise a fusion of chimeric 14A2 IgG antibody that binds to TRAIL R2 receptor with a BHA10 scFv that binds to LTβR. The Hercules antibodies were constructed both as N-terminal and C-terminal BHA10 scFv fusions (see \nFIG. 13\n). N-terminal scFv fusions can be engineered as light chain and/or heavy chain fusions (“N\nL\n-Hercules” or “N\nH\n-Hercules”, respectively). The decision as to which amino terminal V region (heavy or light) is selected for adjoining the scFv is primarily driven by which chain is thought to tolerate a fused scFv which is capable of recognizing the first target antigen while not appreciably interfering with the binding of the Fab domain to the second target antigen.\n\n\nIt is also possible using the methods described in this invention to engineer tetravalent or bispecific antibodies consisting solely of stabilized scFvs fused directly to antibody hinge regions or to CH2 or CH3 domains as depicted, for example, in \nFIGS. 42-49\n. Said antibodies may comprise full-length Fc regions (see, for example, \nFIG. 46\n) or CH2-domain deleted Fc regions (see, for example, \nFIG. 42\n). In other exemplary embodiments, two or more stabilized scFv domains may be fused to the same terminus of a heavy or light chain (see, for example, \nFIG. 43\n).\n\n\nA.

The PCR products from the panel of amplified BHA10 scFvs were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis using the Millipore Ultrafree-DA extraction kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Millipore; Bedford, Mass.). The purified PCR products were digested with Mlu I/Bgl II restriction endonucleases and ligated into an Mlu I/Bgl II digested, pN5KG1 vector containing the chi 14A2 IgG1 previously modified to remove an internal Bgl II site present in the chi 14A2 IgG1 coding sequence. The mammalian expression vector pN5KG1 contains a translation-impaired, modified (intron-containing) neomycin phosphotransferase gene to select for transcriptionally active integration events, and a murine dihydrofolate reductase gene to permit amplification with methotrexate (Barnett, et al., Antibody Expression and Engineering. (Imanaka, H. Y. W. a.

These PCR conditions were used to prepare conventional BHA10 scFv from plasmid pXWU034, BHA10 scFv (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nfrom plasmid pXWU002, BHA10 scFv V\nH\n44:V\nL\n100 from plasmid pIEH006, and BHA10 scFv V\nH\n44:V\nL100\n/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nfrom plasmid pIEH009. The PCR products from the panel of amplified \nBHA\n 10 scFvs were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis using the Millipore Ultrafree-DA extraction kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Millipore; Bedford, Mass.). The purified PCR products were digested with BamH I restriction endonuclease and ligated into a single BamH I site of the pN5KG1 vector previously engineered to contain several modifications. Briefly, the pN5KG1 vector containing chi 14A2 IgG1 was modified to remove the stop codon at the 3′ end of the heavy chain gene and introduce nucleotides coding for the amino acid sequence Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly (SEQ ID NO: 161) immediately followed by a BamH I restriction endonuclease site (coding for Gly-Ser) for cloning. Lastly, an internal unwanted BamH I restriction endonuclease site in chil4A2 VL region was also eliminated.\n\n\nThe resulting panel of constructs form fusion proteins of the variant BHA10 scFvs to the carboxyl terminus of the anti-TRAIL R2 antibody heavy chain through the 16 amino acid Ser(Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinker. Fusion of the conventional BHA10 scFv gene sequence to the carboxyl terminus of the anti-TRAIL R2 antibody heavy chain gene sequence produced plasmid pXWU006. Fusion of BHA10 scFv (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \ngene sequence to the carboxyl terminus of the anti-TRAIL R2 antibody heavy chain gene sequence produced plasmid pXWU034. Fusion of BHA10 scFv V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 gene sequence to the carboxyl terminus of the anti-TRAIL R2 antibody heavy chain gene sequence produced plasmid pXWU035.

Transient Expression of Bispecific Antibodies in CHO Cells\n\n\nPlasmid DNAs pXWU005, pXWU026, pXWU027, pXWU028; and pXWU06, pXWU034, pXWU035, and pXWU036 (Table 16) were used to transform CHO DG44 cells for transient production of antibody protein. Each 20 ug of plasmid DNA was combined with 4×10\n6 \ncells in a volume of 0.4 mls of 1×PBS. The mixture was added to a 0.4 cm cuvette (BioRad) and placed on ice for 15 min. The cells were electroporated at 600 uF and 350 volts with a Gene Pulser electroporator (BioRad). The cells were placed in the CHO-SSFM II media containing 100 uM Hypoxanthine and 16 uM Thymidine into a T-25 flask and incubated at 37° for 4 days.\n\n\nSupernatants containing Hercules proteins produced by this transient CHO expression system were collected and evaluated by Western Blot. \nFIG. 32\n shows that the Hercules antibodies containing either the V\nH\n44:V\nL\n100 (ds=disulfide) or V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFvs dramatically improved expression yields independent of whether the scFv was fused to the N\nH\n- or C-terminus (\n \n \nlanes\n \n \n 3, 4, 7, 8). Surprisingly, no secreted protein was detected with wild type BHA10 scFv nor (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker BHA10 scFv N-terminal fusions indicating the benefit of scFv stabilization on expression (\nlanes\n 6 and 7). In addition, conventional BHA10 scFv and (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker BHA10 scFv C-terminal fusions displayed a significant amount of a ˜55-60 molecular weight byproduct which is substantially reduced in the stabilized constructs suggesting that scFv stabilization may improve product quality.\n\n\nD. Bispecific Binding ELISA Assay\n\n\nSupernatants were tested for individual binding activity to recombinantly produced TRAIL R2 and LTβR receptors in ELISA assays. In both assays, receptor was immobilized onto plates and test samples incubated to permit binding to receptor. Bound samples were detected with labeled antibody.\n\n\n96-well microtiter Immulon II plates (Fisher, Cat#14245-61) were coated with 100 μl/well of 2 μg/ml LTβR-Ig in Na\n2\nCO\n3\n/NaHCO\n3 \nbuffer pH 9.5, overnight at 4° C. and blocked with 200 μl dilution Buffer (0.5% Nonfat Dry Milk in PBS plus 0.01% Thimerosal) for 1 h at 37° C. In the next step, 100 μl individual ‘Hercules’ supernatant or purified protein in dilution buffer was added to duplicate wells and incubated for 1 h at 37° C. After washing with tap water, 100 μl of 100 ng/ml TRAIL-R2 Fc 6X-His tagged fusion protein (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37° C. After washing, 100 μl of a 1/2000 dilution of Penta-His HRP Conjugate (QIAGEN, Cat#34460) was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37° C. After washing, 100 μl/well of a HRPO Substrate combined TMB Peroxidase Substrate/Peroxidase Solution B (Kirdgaard and Perry Labs, Cat. 50-76-00) was added. The reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 2M H\n2\nSO\n4 \nafter 5 to 10 min. The OD was measured at 450 nm and 540 nm using a Molecular Devices plate reader and binding curves were generated.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 33 and 34\n show that both the N-terminal (\nFIG. 33A\n, \n34\nA) and the C-terminal (\nFIG. 33B\n, \n34\nB) Hercules antibodies containing either the V\nH\n44:V\nL\n100 (ds=disulfide) or V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv show improved binding to LTβR (\nFIG. 33\n) and TRAIL R2 (\nFIG. 34\n), respectively, compared to Hercules containing a conventional BHA10 scFv (wt).\n\n\nE. Stable Expression of Bispecific Antibodies in CHO cells, Antibody Purification, and Characterization.\n\n\nPlasmid DNAs pXWU027, pXWU028, and pXWU006, pXWU035, and pXWU036 (Table 16) were used to transform DHFR-deficient CHO DG44 cells for stable production of antibody protein. Transfected cells were grown in alpha minus MEM medium containing 2 mM glutamine supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Corporation) and enriched as a stable bulk culture pool using fluorescently labeled antibodies and reiterative fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Brezinsky, et al. \nJ Immunol Methods. \n277(1-2):141-55 (2003)). FACS was also used to generate individual cell lines. Cell pools or cell lines were adapted to serum-free conditions and scaled for antibody production.\n\n\nSupernatants from transfected CHO cell pools or cells lines expressing 1) C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and 2) C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv, as well as clonal CHO cell lines expressing 3) N-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and 4) N-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv were collected and purified using Protein A Sepharose FF (6 mL) column using a PBS, 10 mM EDTA running buffer. Hercules proteins were eluted using 0.1 M glycine, pH 3.0 and neutralized immediately to pH 7.5-8.5 using Tris base. In addition, C-Hercules containing the conventional BHA10 scFv was expressed and purified by Protein A chromatography for comparison. Protein A eluates from C-Hercules containing the conventional BHA10 scFv, C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 BHA10 scFv, and C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv were examined for the presence of aggregates by analytical size exclusion chromatography (\nFIG. 35\n). The chromatogram profile of C-Hercules containing the conventional BHA10 scFv showed ˜40% aggregates. In contrast, C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 BHA10 scFv reduced the aggregate level to 20% and further stabilization achieved through C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv reduced the level of aggregates to 10%. The level of aggregation appeared to depend upon the properties of the scFv and not whether it was appended to the N\nH\n- or C-terminus of the 14A2 IgG (data not shown). The protein A Hercules eluants were further purified by dialysis into 0.1 M acetate, pH 5.0, and purification by MonoS (GE Healthcare) cation exchange chromatography using an identical running buffer as the dialysate. Hercules proteins were eluted using a step gradient to 0.1 M acetate, pH 5.0, 0.5 M NaCl. The MonoS eluants were collected and passed through a TosoHaas preparative SEC column to remove aggregates.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 36A and 36B\n show SDS-PAGE gels of purified N-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and N\nH\n-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv and C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv, respectively. The reduced lanes show the expected sizes of the heavy and light chain proteins. Importantly, there is no significant level of degraded or unwanted lower molecular weight byproducts that has often been observed with Hercules containing wild type scFv domains.\n\n\n \nFIG. 37\n (Panels A and C) shows the analytical SEC elution profiles of N\nH\n-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and N\nH\n-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv, respectively, subsequent to the initial protein A purification step. \nFIG. 37\n (Panels B and D) also shows the analytical SEC elution profiles of N\nH\n-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and N\nH\n-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv, respectively, following preparative SEC removal of residual non-monomeric protein contaminants. Similarly, \nFIG. 38\n (Panels A and C) shows the analytical SEC elution profiles of C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv, respectively, subsequent to the initial protein A purification step. \nFIG. 38\n (Panels B and D) shows the analytical SEC elution profiles of C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 stabilized BHA10 scFv and C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv, respectively, following preparative SEC removal of residual non-monomeric protein contaminants. These studies demonstrate that stabilization of the BHA10 scFv by addition of either the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 disulfide or the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 disulfide and (Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker results in preparative quantities of >98% pure, monomeric Hercules bispecific antibody that is essentially free of higher order molecular weight species.\n\n\nDSC studies performed under identical conditions demonstrate that C-Hercules V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv is more thermostable than C-Hercules containing conventional BHA10 scFv (\nFIG. 39\n). The denaturation profile for C-Hercules containing conventional BHA10 scFv begins 5° C. lower temperature than the profile observed for the C-Hercules V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv. These results suggest that the scFv may limit the overall thermostability of the Hercules molecules. This correlates with a 5° C. T\nM \nobserved increase for the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv over that of the conventional BHA10 scFv.\n\n\nPurified versions of the stabilized Hercules constructs were then tested for bispecific binding activity to recombinantly produced TRAIL-R2 and LTβR receptors in an ELISA assay. In this assay LTβR Ig receptor was immobilized onto plates and test samples were then incubated to permit binding to receptor. Unbound samples were removed by washing followed by a second incubation step with TRAIL R2-(His)\n6\n. Following a wash step, doubly-bound complexes were detected with a labeled anti-(His)\n6 \nantibody. The results of this study and the effective concentration (EC50, in μg/ml) at which each construct are depicted in \nFIG. 40\n. \nFIG. 40\n shows that both the N-terminal and C-terminal Hercules antibodies with either the V\nH\n44:V\nL\n100 (ds=disulfide) or V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv demonstrate clear bispecific binding to both LTβR and TRAIL R2. A multivalent (pentameric) version of an LTβR-binding antibody (CBE11) was used as a control to demonstrate that single recognition of LTβR alone does not induce signal in the binding assay.\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nScale-Up Production of Stabilized Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies in CHO Cells\n\n\nDHFR-deficient CHO cell lines stably transfected with plasmid DNAs pXWU028 and pXWU036 (Table 16) were screened to select for single cell isolates that are capable of expressing high levels of solubilized and properly-folded Hercules molecules that were stabilized using the methods of the invention. The cell screening methods employed the fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of Brezinky et al. (Brezinky et al., J Immunol Meth (2003). 277:141-155). Briefly, fluorescently tagged anti-Hercules antibodies were used to label CHO cells exhibiting transient expression of Hercules antibodies on their surface. Cells exhibiting a signature fluorescence intensity were then selected by tailoring the gating of the cell sorter apparatus to that signature. Single cells exhibiting high levels of productivity were thereby selected and adapted to serum-free conditions to establish stable producer cell lines. The producer cell lines were subsequently scaled-up for production and purification of the bispecific antibody protein.\n\n\n80 L of N-terminal Hercules containing V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv (XWU028) supernatant from an 11 day bioreactor run was harvested and precleared by ultrafiltration. The bispecific antibody was captured by Protein A chromatography and eluted in 1218 mls volume. The Protein A fraction was further purified in two separate batches by anion exchange chromatography followed by preparative size exclusion chromatography. The first batch yielded 825.5 mg at a concentration of 4.85 mg/ml in PBS with 98.9% purity and an endotoxin load of 0.13 EU/mg. The second batch yielded 318 mg at a concentration of 10.3 mg/ml with a purity of 99.1% and an endotoxin load of 2.37 EU/mg. A total of 1143.5 mg highly purified, monomeric N-terminal Hercules containing V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv was recovered.\n\n\n24 L of C-terminal Hercules containing V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv (XWU036) supernatant from an 11 day bioreactor run was harvested and precleared by ultrafiltration. The bispecific antibody was purified in two separate batches as described above using Protein A chromatography to capture crude product followed by anion exchange chromatography and preparative size exclusion chromatography. The first batch yielded 985.5 mg at a concentration of 13 mg/ml with 98.5% purity and an endotoxin load of 0.01 EU/mg. The second batch yielded 570 mg at a concentration of 11.42 mg/ml with a purity of 99% and an endotoxin load of 1.91 EU/mg. A total of 1555.5 mg highly purified, monomeric C-terminal Hercules containing V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nBHA10 scFv was recovered.\n\n\nA CHO cell line producing the XWU054 bispecific antibody was isolated and found to produce 21.5 mg/L. This is within the expected range for research grade unamplified CHO cell lines and we would anticipate much higher productivity if we were to generate a Production Cell Line.\n\n\nThese scale-up production studies were conducted with non-amplified CHO cell lines and yet resulted in yields exceeding 1 gm of high quality, biophysically stable bispecific antibodies. Presumably a cell line amplification strategy would greatly enhance the cellular productivity of the transfected CHO cell lines enabling the development of processes suitable for commercial applications. These studies exemplify the utility of the methods described in this invention for enabling the scale-up production of stable bispecific antibodies in a cell line (e.g. CHO) suitable for manufacturing.\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nBiological Activity of Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies\n\n\nTumor cell lines WiDr, (ATCC CCL-218) a human colon carcinoma cell line, Me180, (ATCC HTB 33) a human cervical epithelial carcinoma cell line, and MDA231, (Dr. Dajun Yang, University of Michigan) a human breast carcinoma cell line were cultured in MEM-Earles with 10% FCS, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1× non-essential amino acids, 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate, and Penicillin/Streptomycin. Tumor cell lines were rinsed once with PBS and cells released by digestion with trypsin. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in complete media, counted and 96-well tissue culture plates seeded at 5000 cells/well for WiDr and Me180 and 1500 cell/well for MDA231. Human IFNγ (Biogen Idec, Corp) is added to the cell suspensions to result in a final cytokine concentration of 80 U/ml for WiDr and MDA231 and 50 U/ml for Me180. 50 μl of the tumor cell/IFNγ suspension were mixed with 50 μl of 2× concentrated 3-fold serial dilutions of test antibodies prepared in complete media. The final concentrations of test antibodies typically ranged from 5000 pM to 0.07 pM. Cells were grown for 4 days (WiDr & Me180) or 3 days (MDA231) at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2 \nhumidified chamber and cell killing assessed by the addition of 20 μL/well \nPromega CellTiter\n 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay reagent (Promega Corporation, Madison, Wis.). Plates were read in a microtiter plate reader at 490 nM (Spectromax Plus, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale Calif.). Data was graphed using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Inc, WA).\n\n\nResults from these studies are shown in \nFIGS. 41A-41D\n. \nFIG. 41A\n shows that 14A2 IgG antibody had modest activity in inhibiting growth of WiDr tumor cells and in combination with BHA10 IgG exhibited a slight increase in anti-tumor cell activity compared to BHA10 IgG alone. In contrast, both of the bispecific Hercules antibodies showed enhanced tumor cell killing of the WiDr cells. \nFIG. 41B\n shows that both the 14A2 IgG and BHA10 IgG antibodies had modest, if not negligible, activity in inhibiting growth of Me180 tumor cells as single agents or in combination. In contrast, both of the bispecific Hercules antibodies showed tumor cell killing of the Me180 cells. \nFIG. 41C\n shows that both the 14A2 IgG and BHA10 IgG antibodies had negligible activity in inhibiting growth of MDA231 tumor cells as single agents and perhaps some activity when used in combination. In contrast, the bispecific Hercules antibody XWU036 (C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv) showed tumor cell killing of the MDA231 cells. \nFIG. 41D\n shows that none of the antibodies demonstrate any activity towards control cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) demonstrating that the cell killing activity of the bispecific antibodies is not indiscriminant. HUVEC shows positive staining for LTβR and TRAIL-R2 by FACS analysis (data not shown) indicating presence of receptors and that the activity of the bispecific antibody may be dependent on triggering specific or unique pathway components in tumor cells.\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\nStability Studies of Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies\n\n\nReal-time stability studies of the N- and C-terminal bispecific antibody samples XWU028 (BHA10 scFv V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4\nN-Hercules) and XWU036 (BHA10 scFv V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nC-Hercules) stored at 2-8° C. for three months were conducted. Protein quality was assessed for (1) aggregation, (2) precipitation, (3) polypeptide cleavage or proteolysis, and (4) post-translational modifications such as deamidation or oxidation.\n\n\nHigh and low concentration N- and C-terminal bispecific antibody samples used for the studies were XWU028 at 1.8 mg/mL (Low) and 10.3 mg/mL (High) and XWU036 at 5.0 mg/mL (Low) and 11.4 mg/mL (High). Antibodies were formulated in PBS. For the stability study, initial (T=0), intermediate (T=1 wk, 2 wk, 1 mo, 2 mo) and final (T=3 mo) time point samples were analyzed immediately following sample collection. In addition, initial (T=0) samples were frozen and stored at −70° C. until thawed for secondary analyses at the end of the 3-month study. BHA10 IgG (8.7 mg/mL) was used as control and was similarly handled.\n\n\nA. Protein Aggregation and Precipitation Analysis\n\n\nProtein aggregation or precipitation was monitored using analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) linked to inline light scattering and refractive index detectors (Wyatt Technologies, MiniDawn and rEX, respectively). SEC/Light scattering analysis showed no evidence of aggregation or material loss that might occur through precipitation. The SEC elution profiles of the initial, T=0, and final, T=3 mo, time points for XWU028, XWU036, and the BHA10 antibody were nearly identical (\nFIGS. 56A\n, \n56\nB, and \n56\nC, respectively). XWU028 and XWU036 samples both accumulated ˜1% aggregated material by the completion of the study; however detection of these aggregates was near the lower limit of detection determined for this method (Table 17). Aggregate formation was independent of protein concentration. Based on the molecular masses determined using light scattering detection, it is possible that that the low levels of aggregates in the test samples are likely a product of monomeric species converting to dimers. Neither of the bispecific antibodies samples, XWU028 or XWU036, accumulated detectable levels of high-order aggregates, even though this type of aggregate would have easily been observed using these methods. The BHA10 antibody demonstrated no increase in aggregates over the 3-month course of the study (Table 17).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent monomer detected using analytical size exclusion chromatography.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nT = 1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nT = 2\n\n\nT = 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nT = 0\n\n\nweek\n\n\nT = 2 week\n\n\nT = 1 mo\n\n\nmo\n\n\n \nmo\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQID#\n \n \n \n \n \n \n49 Low\n\n\n99.0\n\n\n98.7\n\n\n98.4\n\n\n98.3\n\n\n98.2\n\n\n97.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSEQID#\n49 High\n\n\n99.1\n\n\n99.0\n\n\n98.9\n\n\n98.6\n\n\n98.2\n\n\n98.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSEQID#\n51 Low\n\n\n98.8\n\n\n97.5\n\n\n97.5\n\n\n97.4\n\n\n97.2\n\n\n96.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSEQID#\n51 High\n\n\n98.9\n\n\n98.8\n\n\n98.7\n\n\n98.5\n\n\n98.1\n\n\n96.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBHA10 IgG\n\n\n97.4\n\n\n97.5\n\n\n97.5\n\n\n97.5\n\n\n97.3\n\n\n97.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB. Proteolysis and Post-Translational Modification Analyses\n\n\nProteolysis was monitored using SDS-PAGE and liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) intact mass analysis (Agilent LC/MSD TOF coupled to an Agilent 1100 LC system via an electrospray interface). For SDS-PAGE analysis, 5 ug of protein was loaded per lane. Reduced samples were prepared in 1×Tris-glycine sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. XWU028 and XWU036 showed no evidence of proteolysis over the 3-month storage period at 2-8° C. as determined by non-reducing and reducing SDS-PAGE analysis (\nFIGS. 57A\n and B). Similarly, XWU028 and XWU036 showed no evidence of lower molecular weight proteolytic products over the 3-month storage period at 2-8° C. as determined by LC/MS analysis (\nFIG. 58\n).\n\n\nPost-translational modifications were monitored using LC/MS. T=0, T=1 mo, and T=3 mo samples were analyzed in both the non-reduced and reduced form. Reduced samples were prepared by treating in 50 mM DTT/4M guanidine hydrochloride for 1 hour at 37° C. HPLC Buffer A consists of 0.03% TFA in water and HPLC buffer B contains 0.025% TFA in acetonitrile. Flow rate was kept constant at 100 μl per minute. 7.5 μg of each sample (reduced and non-reduced) was injected onto a 2.1×50 mm C4 column and analyzed by Agilent ESI-TOF. A bind-and-elute method was used for non-reduced samples while a gradient method was used for reduced samples. Spectra were obtained using the Analyst and deconvoluted using the MaxEnt1 software packages included with the instrumentation. Deconvoluted mass spectra of XWU028 and XWU036 (high concentrations) at T=0, T=1 mo, and T=3 mo are shown in \nFIG. 58\n. Neither XWU028, nor XWU036, demonstrated any detectable changes in their mass spectra, indicating absence of post-translational modification that could potentially adversely affect bispecific antibody function or stability.\n\n\nTaken together, the data indicate that both the N- and C-terminal bispecific antibodies containing stabilized scFv domains are stable under extended storage conditions such as those required for biological drug products. These results are particularly encouraging because these stability studies were conducted with the N- and C-terminal bispecific antibodies prepared in a simple buffer (PBS) and not with solutions prepared with optimal formulations.\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\nIn Vivo Pharmacokinetic Activity and Serum Stability of Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies\n\n\nA single bolus injection of 10 mg/kg (1 mg/ml) of N-terminal Hercules (XWU028) or C-terminal Hercules (XWU036) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was administered intraperitoneally into male CB17-scid mice. Mice were sacrificed at 0, 0.5, 2, 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168, 240, and 336 hours post-injection using three mice per timepoint for each bispecific antibody. Serum samples were prepared for analysis by ELISA assay to quantify levels of the bispecific antibodies. ELISA plates were coated with goat-anti-human IgG, blocked with PBS/1% BSA, and dilutions of serum containing the bispecific antibodies were serially diluted in PBS/1% BSA, added to the plates and incubated. Captured antibodies were detected with a goat-anti-human kappa chain-HRP-linked antibody. Results of the pharmacokinetic study are shown in Table 18. N-terminal Hercules (XWU028) has an elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) of 10.3 days with a peak serum concentration of 85.67 μg/ml. C-terminal Hercules (XWU036) has a longer elimination half-life (t\n1/2\n) of 15.1 days with a peak serum concentration of 105.67 μg/ml. Both molecules have similar volumes of distribution (Vd) though these values have not been adjusted for bioavailability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetic Parameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nN-terminal Hercules\n\n\nC-terminal Hercules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(XWU028)\n\n\n(XWU036)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nUnits\n\n\nValue\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT½\n\n\nhr\n\n\n247.9386\n\n\n362.3607\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCmax\n\n\nug/ml\n\n\n85.67\n\n\n105.67\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVd*\n\n\nL/kg\n\n\n0.1707\n\n\n0.1748\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCl*\n\n\nml/min/kg\n\n\n0.008\n\n\n0.0056\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*not adjusted for bioavailability\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSerum samples were also analyzed in the bispecific binding ELISA described in Example 7. In this assay, the serum samples containing N-terminal Hercules (XWU028) or C-terminal Hercules (XWU036) described above were tested for bispecific binding activity to recombinantly produced TRAIL-R2 and LTβR receptors in an ELISA assay. \nFIGS. 59A\n and B show that serum samples from N- and C-terminal Hercules treated mice contain antibodies that bispecifically bind to both TRAIL-R2 and LTβR and closely parallel the elimination profiles observed from the PK study indicating that the bispecific antibodies are remaining intact under physiological conditions for extended periods of time.\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\nIn Vivo Biological Activity of Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies\n\n\n(A) In Vivo Biological Activity of Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies in a Colon Cancer Tumor Model\n\n\nWiDr human colon carcinoma (2×10E6 cells per mouse) cells were implanted subcutaneously into 125 athymic nude mice. The tumors were grown until they reached approximately 100 mg, at which point a total of 70 mice were selected for the study, divided into 7 groups of 10 mice. IP treatments were administered, beginning on \nday\n 13 post-implantation, as follows: \nGroup\n 1=pyrogen-free PBS; \nGroup\n 2=CBE11, 2 mg/kg, 1×/wk; \nGroup\n 3=hBHA10, 2 mg/kg, 2×/wk; \nGroup\n 4=ch14A2, 2 mg/kg, 2×/wk; \nGroup\n 5=Hercules-II XWU028, 2 mg/kg, 1×/wk; \nGroup\n 6=Hercules-II XWU036, 2 mg/kg, 1×/wk; \nGroup\n 7=hBHA10+ch14A2, 1 mg/kg each, 2×/wk. Tumor sizes and body weights were recorded bi-weekly. Study was terminated when average tumor size of vehicle group reached approximately 2000 mg. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula: (L×W\n2\n/2). Interim analyses of mice treated with the XWU028 and XWU036 showed significant anti-tumor activity (p<0.001) for both bispecific antibodies compared to PBS vehicle control (\nFIG. 60\n).\n\n\nFor XWU028, significant anti-tumor responses (p<0.05) were observed compared to responses with single hBHA10 or ch14A2 mAb treatment. For XWU036, a significant anti-tumor response (p<0.05) was observed compared to the response with ch14A2 mAb treatment and, notably, a greater significant response (p<0.01) compared to hBHA10 mAb. Importantly, the bispecific antibodies showed superior in vivo anti-tumor activity though administered only once per week suggesting that the stability enhancements described in this invention result in improved antibody properties and physical stability under physiological conditions.\n\n\n(B) In Vivo Biological Activity of Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies in a Breast Cancer Tumor Model\n\n\nMDA-MB-231 human breast carcinoma cells were implanted subcutaneously into 135 athymic nude mice (2×10E6 cells per mouse). The tumors were grown until \nday\n 13 at which \npoint\n 75 tumor-bearing mice with an average size of approximately 168 mg were assigned to treatment (N=10) and vehicle control (N=15) groups. Mice received antibodies and vehicle IP starting at \nday\n 13. Exemplary groups are shown as follows: \nGroup\n 1=pyrogen-free PBS; 1×/wk; \nGroup\n 2=hBHA10, 2 mg/kg, 2×/wk; \nGroup\n 3=ch14A2, 2 mg/kg, 2×/wk; \nGroup\n 4=Hercules-II XWU036, 2 mg/kg, 1×/wk; \nGroup\n 5=hBHA10+ch14A2, 1 mg/kg each, 2×/wk. Tumor sizes and body weights were recorded bi-weekly. Study was terminated when average tumor size of vehicle group reached approximately 2800 mg. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula: (L×W\n2\n/2). XWU036 demonstrated statistically significant (p<0.001) anti-tumor activity compared to either single treatment with hBHA10 or ch14A2 mAbs or to treatment with a mixture of the two antibodies. Importantly, the bispecific antibody XWU036 demonstrated good anti-tumor activity in vivo administered on a once per week dosing schedule suggesting that the stability enhancements described in this invention result in improved antibody properties and physical stability under physiological conditions (see \nFIG. 86\n).\n\n\nExample 13\n\n\nProduction of Stabilized Bispecific “Hercules” Antibodies Containing Non-Covalent Stabilizing scFv Mutations\n\n\nBHA10 scFvs of the invention containing non-covalent stabilizing mutations alone and in combination with a V\nH\n44-\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100 disulfide bond were used to construct stabilized bispecific C-Hercules antibodies comprising a fusion of chimeric 14A2 IgG antibody that binds to TRAIL R2 receptor with a BHA10 scFv that binds to LTβR. The bispecific antibodies were constructed as C-terminal BHA10 scFv fusions using methods essentially as described in Example 7.\n\n\nA.

The variant BHA10 scFv gene fragments were gel isolated. Due to a BamHI site in the linker region of plasmids pIEH-050 and pIEH-052, the gene fragments were digested with pPuM I and Kpn I restriction endonucleases and ligated to the modified plasmid pN5KG1 digested with the same restriction endonucleases resulting in a fusion product of the stabilized anti-LTBR (BHA10) scFvs to the carboxyl terminus of the anti-TRAILR2 (14A2) antibody CH3 domain through a 16 amino acid Ser(Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinker.

Stable Expression of Bispecific Antibodies in CHO cells, Antibody Purification, and Characterization.\n\n\nDHFR-deficient CHO cell lines stably transfected with plasmid DNAs pXWU054 and pXWU055 and adapted to serum-free conditions were scaled for production of bispecific antibody protein and proteins purified as described in Example 8. Protein A eluates from supernatants containing C-Hercules with the stabilized V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L BHA10 scFv and C-bispecific antibody with the stabilized V\nH\n44-V\nL\n100V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L BHA10 scFv were examined for the presence of aggregates by analytical size exclusion chromatography (\nFIG. 65\n). The chromatogram profile of C-Hercules containing the conventional BHA10 scFv showed ˜40% aggregates. In contrast, C-terminal Hercules with the stabilized V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L BHA10 scFv significantly reduced aggregates to levels comparable to that observed with standard IgGs.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 66A and 66B\n show SDS-PAGE gels of purified C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L BHA10 scFv and C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:V\nL\n100V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L BHA10 scFv, respectively. The reduced lanes show the expected sizes of the heavy and light chain proteins. Importantly, there is no significant level of degraded or unwanted lower molecular weight byproducts that has often been observed with Hercules containing wild type scFv domains.\n\n\n \nFIGS. 67A and 67B\n show the analytical SEC elution profiles of C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L BHA10 scFv and C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/V\nH \nS16E+V\nL \nS46L BHA10 scFv, respectively, subsequent to the initial protein A purification step.

In contrast, both of the bispecific Hercules antibodies (XWU054 and XWU055) showed enhanced tumor cell killing of the WiDr cells comparable to that observed with the XWU036 molecule (C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv) described in Example 10. \nFIG. 68A\n shows that both the 14A2 IgG and BHA10 IgG antibodies had negligible activity in inhibiting growth of MDA231 tumor cells as single agents as well as when used in combination. In contrast, the bispecific Hercules antibodies (XWU054 and XWU055) showed enhanced tumor cell killing of the MDA231 cells comparable to that observed with the XWU036 molecule (C-terminal Hercules with the V\nH\n44:\nV\n \n \n \nL\n100/(Gly\n4\nSer)\n4 \nlinker stabilized BHA10 scFv) described in Example 10.\n\n\nExample 15\n\n\nUtilization of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) to Measure Thermal Stability of Human or Humanized Antibody Sequences\n\n\nTo assess the range of apparent stabilities of antibodies, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a set of 17 human or humanized BIIB antibodies.\n\n\nThe BIIB antibodies were dialyzed exhaustively against a 20 mM sodium citrate, 150 mM sodium chloride buffer at pH 6.0. Dialysates were used within the reference cell of a calorimeter to define the baseline of each antibody scan. Subsequent to dialysis, the concentrations of BIIB1-17 were measured by 280 nm absorbance (Pace et al., \nProtein Sci. \n4, 2411-2423, 1995). Antibody solutions used for DSC were universally prepared at 1 mg/mL by diluting the concentrated stocks with their dialysates.\n\n\nScans were performed using an automated capillary differential scanning calorimeter (capDSC, MicroCal, LLC). Protein and reference solutions were sampled automatically from 96-well plates using the robotic attachment. Prior to each protein scan, 2 scans were performed with buffer in the sample cell and used for background subtraction. A single cleaning scan was performed using 5% Liquinox after every protein scan. After every scan, the instrument automatically rinsed both the reference and sample cells with 3×-2 mL distilled deionized H\n2\nO containing 0.01% sodium azide. Scans were performed at 1° C./min using the medium feedback mode for enhanced peak resolution. The scan range was 20-95° C. All 96-well plates containing protein were stored within the instrument at 6° C.\n\n\nScans were analyzed using the Origin software supplied by the manufacturer. Subsequent to background subtraction, non-zero baselines were corrected using a third order polynomial. The unfolding transitions of each IgG1 domain were deconvoluted by fitting the multi-peak curves to 3 separate transitions. Recombinant IgG1 and IgG4 Fcγ domains were utilized to identify the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 peaks within each transition. The remaining transition(s) was assumed to correspond to the unfolding of the Fab portion of the antibody.\n\n\nMost of the Fab portions of the 17 antibodies unfolded in apparent single transitions with midpoints of thermal unfolding (T\nM\ns) ranging from 57 to 82° C. depending on the unique properties of each individual Fv. Only three antibodies, BIIB15, BIIB16, and BIIB17 exhibited 4 transitions. A typical IgG1 DSC trace is shown in \nFIG. 69A\n. The C\nPmax \n(i.e. the height of a DSC peak) for Fab portions is generally significantly greater than that of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 or \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains. This is reasonable considering the Fab protein mass within an antibody is 4-fold greater than that of either the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 or the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains, and the Fab portion of the antibody also contains buried surface area between 4 domains as opposed to the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains whose transitions each involve the disruption of only a single homodimeric interface. In general, the transitions observed for the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains of each IgG1 antibody superimposed well upon one another. The same is true for the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains of the 3 IgG4s. For these reasons, the Fab transitions of each IgG1 or IgG4 molecule were readily identified. One antibody (BIIB18) was not studied by DSC. BIIB18 expressed poorly and never resulted in soluble/non-aggregated material. This antibody was included in the sequence analyses described in Example 16.\n\n\nOne of the antibodies, BIIB7, was analyzed in both the human IgG1 and IgG4 format. The apparent Fab thermostabilities of BIIB7 in the IgG1 and IgG4 format as measured by the midpoints of their thermal unfolding transitions (T\nM\n) were very similar (see \nFIG. 69B\n). Variation in the constant domain subclass did not affect the Fab T\nM \nor Fab calorimetric unfolding enthalpy.\n\n\nThe overlapping transitions corresponding to the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains of the IgG4 Fc occur at significantly lower temperatures than those of IgG1 and artificially make the Fab transitions look ˜1-2° C. lower for IgG4. Once the IgG transitions are completely deconvoluted, the Fab T\nM\ns are much closer than they appear in the DSC traces (ΔT\nM\n<1° C.). The fact that the Fab DSC curves of BIIB7 in the IgG1 and IgG4 formats were highly similar suggests that the thermostability of the IgG1 Fabs and IgG4 Fabs can be directly compared.\n\n\nDSC measurements with 17 of the humanized BIIB antibodies indicate that the Fv regions heavily influenced the apparent stability of their respective Fabs. For example, \nFIG. 70\n demonstrates the very different DSC curves obtained for BIIB1, BIIB4, BIIB6 and BIIB16. All four antibodies are IgG1, and the only sequence differences between them reside in the Fv region. The position and magnitude of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 DSC transitions of all 17 antibodies are independent of the Fab to which they are attached (see \nFIG. 70\n). The range of Fab T\nM\ns for the top 17 antibodies in Table 20 was between 57.2 and 81.6° C. (+24.4° C.), with BIIB1 exhibiting the highest apparent Fab stability and BIIB17 the lowest.\n\n\nThe three antibodies with the lowest measurable Fab T\nM \nvalues, BIIB15, BIIB16, and BIIB17, demonstrate a disconnect between domain unfolding transitions within the Fab (See \nFIG. 70\n for BIIB16's DSC curve). The expected Fab peak was split into two separate transitions. The lower T\nM \ntransitions were listed in Table 20, but a second transition, which may represent the unfolding of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1/C\nL \nstructural unit, occurred with T\nM\ns of 74, 72 and 70° C. for BIIB15, BIIB16 and BIIB17, respectively. BIIB18 was included in the study as an example of an antibody which would not express and whose V\nH \nsequence diverged significantly from consensus (see Example 16).\n\n\nThe DSC analyses clearly showed that the unique properties of individual Fv-regions can highly attenuate the apparent T\nM\ns of an entire Fab portion of an antibody. In the extreme cases of BIIB15, BIIB16 and BIIB17, the apparent Fv stabilities were low enough that the unfolding transitions of the domains within the Fab portion became uncoupled from one another. In order to maintain an apparent single transition for the unfolding of all four domains of the Fab, there may be a minimum overall T\nM \nlimit (>70° C. for IgG1s under the scan conditions described here), otherwise multiple transitions appear. It would be convenient to assign the low temperature unfolding transitions of BIIB15, BIIB16, and BIIB17 to the Fv and the second, higher temperature transitions, to the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1/C\nL \ndomain. However, Ewert and coworkers have shown that V\nH\n/V\nL \ndomain unfolding is not always coupled and can depend on subclass, V\nH\n/V\nL \nstability, and V\nH\n/V\nL \ncomplementarity (Ewert et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n325: 531-553, 2003). In fact, very few of their V\nH\n/V\nL \nscFv constructs with consensus-derived frameworks exhibited cooperative unfolding. Therefore, it is likely that, as the transitions uncouple, the unfolding scenario may be more complicated than a simple split into two transitions representing the Fv-region and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1/C\nL\n-regions.\n\n\nThe apparent stabilities as measured by DSC for the BIIB7 IgG1 and IgG4 Fabs were highly similar even though there are substantial inherent differences in \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 sequence and disulfide-bonding between the two subclasses. There are many possible explanations for this such as (1) the biophysical properties of the Fv set the thermostability ceiling of the BIIB7 Fab regardless of whether the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 is IgG1 or IgG4, (2) the apparent stability of the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1/C\nL \nregion is identical between IgG1 and IgG4, or (3) the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1/C\nL \nstructural unit does not unfold within the timeframe of the DSC experiment. The fact that the BIIB7 Fab unfolded at a single T\nM \nand with a similar calorimetric enthalpy in both the IgG1 and IgG4 formats suggests a potential stability dependence upon the Fv and not the constant regions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB IgG Fab T\nM\n-values, V\nH \nand V\nκ \nscores and germlines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFab\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nV\nH\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nV\nκ\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nT\nM\n \n\n\nV\nH\n \n\n\n \n\n\nV\nH\n \n\n\nsubclass\n\n\n \n\n\nV\nκ\n \n\n\n \n\n\nV\nκ\n \n\n\nsubclass\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgG\n\n\n(° C.)\n\n\nsubclass\n\n\nV\nH \ngermline\na\n \n\n\nscore\n\n\nscore\n\n\nΔscore\n\n\nsubclass\n\n\nV\nκ \ngermline\na\n \n\n\nscore\n\n\nscore\n\n\nΔscore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB1\n\n\n81.6\n\n\nVH1\n\n\nX92340VH1\n\n\n58.8\n\n\n70.1 +/− 3.1\n\n\n+3.7\n\n\nVK1\n\n\nM64855VK1\n\n\n78.2\n\n\n80.3 +/− 3.5\n\n\n−2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB2\n\n\n78.5\n\n\nVH1\n\n\nX92340VH1\n\n\n72.2\n\n\n70.1 +/− 3.1\n\n\n+2.1\n\n\nVK1\n\n\nM64855VK1\n\n\n72.8\n\n\n80.3 +/− 3.5\n\n\n−8.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB3\n\n\n78.2\n\n\nVH1\n\n\nAB019438VH1\n\n\n72.6\n\n\n70.1 +/− 3.1\n\n\n+2.5\n\n\nVK2\n\n\nX12684VK2\n\n\n82.4\n\n\n85.3 +/− 2.1\n\n\n−2.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB4\n\n\n77.7\n\n\nVH3\n\n\nM99649VH3\n\n\n96.1\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n+3.9\n\n\nVK2\n\n\nX12684VK2\n\n\n83.9\n\n\n85.3 +/− 2.1\n\n\n−1.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB5\n\n\n77.1\n\n\nVH2\n\n\nX56365VH4\n\n\n69.8\n\n\n68.1 +/− 5.5\n\n\n+1.7\n\n\nVK1\n\n\nX59316VK1\n\n\n83.0\n\n\n80.3 +/− 3.5\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB6\n\n\n76.8\n\n\nVH3\n\n\nM99649VH3\n\n\n97.7\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n+5.6\n\n\nVK1\n\n\nM64855VK1\n\n\n77.4\n\n\n80.3 +/− 3.5\n\n\n−2.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB7\n\n\n75.9\n\n\nVH1\n\n\nAB019438VH1\n\n\n72.7\n\n\n70.1 +/− 3.1\n\n\n+2.6\n\n\nVK3\n\n\nX72812VK3\n\n\n83.2\n\n\n84.1 +/− 2.4\n\n\n−0.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB8\n\n\n75.6\n\n\nVH1\n\n\nZ14300VH1\n\n\n58.0\n\n\n70.1 +/− 3.1\n\n\n+2.9\n\n\nVK1\n\n\nX59316VK1\n\n\n79.8\n\n\n80.3 +/− 3.5\n\n\n−0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB9\n\n\n74.7\n\n\nVH3\n\n\nZ12358VH3\n\n\n95.2\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n+3.0\n\n\nVK4\n\n\nZ00023VK4\n\n\n88.8\n\n\n92.6 +/− 2.6\n\n\n−3.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB10\n\n\n74.7\n\n\nVH4\n\n\nX56365VH4\n\n\n69.3\n\n\n68.1 +/− 5.5\n\n\n+0.8\n\n\nVK1\n\n\nX59316VK1\n\n\n84.0\n\n\n80.3 +/− 3.5\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB11\n\n\n58.1\n\n\nVH1\n\n\nAB019438VH1\n\n\n71.3\n\n\n70.1 +/− 3.1\n\n\n+1.2\n\n\nVK4\n\n\nZ00023VK4\n\n\n94.4\n\n\n92.6 +/− 2.6\n\n\n1.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB12\n\n\n71.2\n\n\nVH1\n\n\nAB019438VH1\n\n\n67.9\n\n\n70.1 +/− 3.1\n\n\n−2.2\n\n\nVK4\n\n\nZ00023VK4\n\n\n92.5\n\n\n92.6 +/− 2.6\n\n\n−0.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB13\n\n\n70.8\n\n\nVH3\n\n\nM99657VH3\n\n\n91.1\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n−1.3\n\n\nVK4\n\n\nZ00023VK4\n\n\n93.1\n\n\n92.6 +/− 2.6\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB14\n\n\n70.6\n\n\nVH7\n\n\nL10057VH7\n\n\n65.1\n\n\n70.2 +/− 3.2\n\n\n−5.1\n\n\nVK-\n\n\n—\n\n\n56.6\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB15\n\n\n68.5\n\n\nVH3\n\n\nM99660VH3\n\n\n92.4\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n+0.2\nb\n \n\n\nVK1\n\n\nM64858VK1\n\n\n81.6\n\n\n80.3 +/− 3.5\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB16\n\n\n68.0\n\n\nVH3\n\n\nM99649VH3\n\n\n95.6\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n+3.3\nb\n \n\n\nVK3\n\n\nX72812VK3\n\n\n82.0\n\n\n84.1 +/− 2.4\n\n\n−2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB17\n\n\n57.2\n\n\nVH3\n\n\nJ00239VH3\n\n\n89.4\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n−3.0\n\n\nVK2\n\n\nX63397VK2\n\n\n84.8\n\n\n85.3 +/− 2.1\n\n\n−0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBIIB18\n\n\n—\nc\n \n\n\nVH3\n\n\nM99400VH3\n\n\n80.0\n\n\n92.2 +/− 4.5\n\n\n−12.3\nb\n \n\n\nVK2\n\n\nX63397VK2\n\n\n84.5\n\n\n85.3 +/− 2.1\n\n\n−0.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nLefranc et al., 1999;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nb\nUnusual insertion/deletion in CDR1 or CDR2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nc\nDid not express\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 16\n\n\nUtilization of Consensus Scoring to Identify Antibody Variable Region with Sub-Optimal Stability\n\n\nConsensus scoring was utilized as a method for identifying which of the BIIB antibodies contained significantly large numbers of non-optimal amino acids within their Fv regions. The scoring assesses the relative drift from consensus V\nH \nand V\nκ\n sequences due to hypersomatic mutations and evolutionary germline variations. The DSC measurements for the 17 antibodies were used to qualify the ability of the consensus scoring approach for predicting poor antibody stability.\n\n\nThe reference set of mammalian V\nH \nand V\nκ\n kappa sequences used to derive the consensus sequence for scoring and the individual amino acid frequencies at each residue position were collected, sorted, and culled as described previously (Demarest et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n335: 41-48, 2004). The mammalian reference sets were naively constructed to include V-genes from various mammals in order to obtain diversity via the evolutionary drift between species. The V\nH \nmammalian reference set contains 61 V\nH \nsequences primarily from NCBI and TIGR representing a total of 17 different mammalian species. The V\nκ\n mammalian reference set contains 53 V\nκ\n sequences from 13 different mammalian species.\n\n\nHuman V\nH \nand V\nκ\n sequences for building a reference set (or for use as test sequences) were gathered from the NCBI database using the search criteria “homo sapiens antibody variable heavy chain” and “homo sapiens antibody kappa variable light chain”, respectively. A total of 182 human V-gene sequences, 114 V\nH \nand 68 V\nκ\n, were semi-randomly selected from the NCBI database for comparison against mammalian V\nH \nand V\nκ\n databases. The subclass distribution of human V\nH \nand V\nκ\n sequences obtained by semi-random cherry-picking of the NCBI database yielded the expected subclass representation based on natural germline V\nH \nor V\nκ\n usage (Guigou et al., 1990) suggesting little bias in the way sequences were chosen from the NCBI.\n\n\nThe sequences were then categorized into their individual variable domain subclasses (V\nH\n1-\nV\n \n \n \nH\n7 and V\nκ\n1-V\nκ\n4) by ClustalW alignment against the subclass consensus sequences obtained from Aho's Amazing Atlas of Antibody Anatomy website. The subclasses were additionally confirmed by alignment against the publicly available human germline sequences (Lefranc et al., \nNucleic Acids Res. \n27, 209-212, 1999). No more than 5 human sequences from any one multi-sequence NCBI submission were included within the reference sets to reduce potential bias introduced by primer sets or antigen-based V-gene usage. The sequence gathering was performed naively; therefore, there was a natural abundance of \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 and \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n1 sequences after subclass grouping. The average score and standard deviation (described below and in Table 20) were calculated for each subclass using 25 \nV\n \n \n \nH\n1, 3 \nV\n \n \n \nH\n2, 44 \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3, 34 \nV\n \n \n \nH\n4, 5 \nV\n \n \n \nH\n5, 3 \nV\n \n \n \nH\n7, 29 \nV\n \n \n \nκ \n1, 4 \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n2, 19 \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n3 and 16 \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n4 human sequences. Only 2 of the 18 antibodies (BIIB5 and BIIB14) contained V\nH \ndomains with minimal subgroup sequence populations (i.e. \nV\n \n \n \nH\n2, \nV\n \n \n \nH\n5 or V\nH\n7). Four of the 18 antibodies (BIIB3, BIIB4, BIIB17 and BIIB18) contained \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n2 subclass variable domains whose subclass was underrepresented in sequence space and whose scoring accuracy was ill defined. No \nnatural V\n \n \n \nH\n6 sequences were found within the human V\nH \nsequence reference set. This was not a concern as none of the BIIB antibody constructs contained a \nV\n \n \n \nH\n6 domain.\n\n\nThe variable domain sequences of the 18 BIIB antibodies and the 182 human V\nH \nand V\nκ\n sequences obtained from the NCBI were scored against the reference set of mammalian antibody sequences. All V\nH \nand V\nκ\n sequences were truncated prior to CDR3 (two residues after the consensus YYC residues) to reduce the unpredictability introduced by the hypervariable nature of the V-(D-)J-C joining region. Residue frequencies (p\ni\n(r)), at every position within the mammalian database were calculated by summing the number of times each amino acid (A, C, D . . . V, W, Y,-) occurs at each residue position within the database divided by the total number of sequences. Scores were evaluated for each human V\nH \nand V\nκ \ntest sequence using the following formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscore\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n∑\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nh\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n⁡\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nr\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n⁡\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nr\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein c\ni\n(r) equals the consensus residue frequency at each position of the mammalian variable domain databases and h\ni\n(r) equals the test residue frequency of each amino acid of the human variable domain test sequence. Perfect consensus scores for the consensus sequences of the mammalian databases were 104 for V\nH \nand 100 for V\nκ\n.\n\n\nA. Scoring Random V\nH \nand V\nκ\n Sequences Using a Mammalian V-Gene Database\n\n\nV\nH \nand V\nκ\n subclass consensus sequences were scored against the mammalian databases consensus and plotted in \nFIGS. 71A and 71C\n, respectively. The V\nH\n3-subclass consensus scored only 1 point lower than the hypothetical “perfect” score of the mammalian database consensus and differed from the mammalian database consensus by a total of three residues. Thus, it is apparent that the mammalian database is biased towards V\nH\n3-like sequences. All other human V\nH \nsubclass consensus sequences scored significantly lower. A bias towards \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n4 sequences was observed for the mammalian V\nκ\n database (\nFIG. 71C\n). The human or humanized BIIB sequence scores were analyzed based on the performance of human NCBI sequences of comparable subclass. Distributions of the individual V\nH \nsequence scores are shown in \nFIG. 71B\n, and distributions of the individual V\nκ\n sequence scores are shown in \nFIG. 71D\n.\n\n\nB. Scoring Results for BIIB1 Through BIIB18\n\n\nV\nH \nand V\nκ\n scores for all 18 BIIB antibodies were calculated and compared to the relative numbers derived from the NCBI human V-gene sequence reference set (Table 20). Also included in Table 20 is the difference between the BIIB V-gene score and the average subclass score. It is the difference between these scores that was used for examining potential stability trends. BIIB1 through 18 were labeled in descending order of their measured Fab stabilities. The V-gene subclass and the closest individual human germline for the BIIB V\nH \nand V\nκ\n genes were determined by ClustalW analysis.\n\n\nConsensus-based scores were derived for the 18 BIIB antibodies and compared to the experimentally determined Fab thermal unfolding profiles. BIIB antibodies with greatest difference between the BIIB V-gene score and their average subclass score (ie. lowest sequence scores) was correlated with the low Fab T\nM\nS measured in Example 15 (Table 20, \nFIG. 72A\n). There was no apparent trend correlating V\nκ\n scores with the TMS measured by DSC (\nFIG. 72B\n). In fact, the lowest scoring V\nκ\n sequence belonged to BIIB2 which had the second highest apparent Fab stability.\n\n\nUnusual CDR amino acid insertions and deletions were found in BIIB15 and BIIB16, as well as in BIIB18, which had the worst V\nH \nscore of all the BIIB antibodies and never expressed at appreciable levels. V\nH \nscoring did not suggest potential stability problems for BIIB15 and BIIB16; however, their Fab T\nM\ns were two of the lowest tested (\nFIG. 72A\n). BIIB15 contained an unusually long CDR1 (13 amino acids in length and 2 longer than any V\nH\n3-like domain in our mammalian database or \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain in our set of human sequences) and BIIB16 contained an unusually short CDR2 (15 amino acids in length and 1 amino acid shorter than the significant majority of the \nother V\n \n \n \nH\n3 CDR2s in both our mammalian V\nH \ndatabase and our reference set of human V\nH\nS).\n\n\nC. Utility of Small Mammalian Sequence Databases for Residue Frequency Analysis and Stability Prediction of the BIIB Fabs\n\n\nScoring the BIIB V\nH \ndomains against the mammalian database of V\nH \nsequences proved to be a useful tool for determining the abundance of non-optimal amino acids within each V\nH \ndomain, which may in turn limit the overall stability of a Fab. The scores were useful for picking out Fabs with low stability and the potential for reduced in vitro longevity and increased aggregation rates. Based on the subclass biases observed for the mammalian V-gene databases, one might question whether it would be best to use strictly human V-gene databases for performing the consensus scoring as opposed to the mammalian database used here. However, based on the significant number of stability determining variables that the scoring does not reflect, such as the exact residue positions of non-consensus amino acids, the strength of the V\nH\n/V\nL \ninteraction, the nature of the V-(D-)J-C joining and the incidence of hypersomatic insertions or deletions, it is difficult to believe that an all-human V\nH \ndatabase would provide a significant improvement. A strictly human database used for scoring may also require a significantly greater number of sequences to match the evolutionary diversity naively included within the mammalian database. One piece of data that indicates the mammalian database approach works well is that the human subclass consensus V\nH \nsequences scored in ascending order of their genomic subclass abundance and apparent subclass usage (Guigou et al., 1990; Teale and Medina, 1992; Tomlinson et al., 1992). The mammalian V\nH \ndatabase appears to weight the overall contributions of the human V\nH \nsubclasses appropriately. The fact that each V\nH \nand V\nκ\n subclass consensus sequence generally scored higher than the vast majority of the individual and unique human sequences picked from the NCBI suggests that the mammalian database is capturing consensus information for all subclasses, even though a bias exists towards \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3. Therefore, due to the existence of other stability-influencing factors that the scoring does not incorporate, the trend observed in \nFIG. 72A\n is unlikely to improve by fine-tuning of the V\nH \nsequence database used for scoring.\n\n\nUnusual insertions or deletions in V\nH \ndomains appear to have significant effects on stability not reflected by consensus scoring. The unusually long (13 amino acids) CDR1 of BIIB15 and the unusually short (15 amino acids) CDR2 of BIIB16 are likely carry-overs of humanization from the original mouse sequence. In fact, the BIIB16 V\nH \nsequence aligns closely with two mouse V\nH \nsequences in our mammalian database that also contained a 15 amino acid CDR2. Forcing the unusually small CDR onto the human framework may have adversely affected the stability of this antibody. BIIB18 not only displayed the lowest V\nH \nscore of all the BIIB sequences but also contained an extraordinarily long CDR2 (22 residues compared to the usual 19 amino acid maximum). Thus, it is not surprising considering the multiple possible problems inherent within the sequence of BIIB18 that it never reached expression levels allowing for anything other than extremely crude biological assays with unpurified supernatants. The results for BIIB15, BIIB16 and BIIB18 suggest that unusual V\nH \ninsertions or deletions may have a greater effect on antibody thermostability than most single point mutations. The exceptionally poor behavior of BIIB18 was not predicted based on a perfunctory glance over its sequence as its Fv contained all the “essential” amino acids strictly conserved within the V-gene folds. Having the ability to pick out troublesome antibodies using a somewhat finer comb is the real the utility of the scoring approach.\n\n\nNo trends were apparent when comparing the measured Fab stabilities against the V\nκ\n scores. Combining the V\nκ\n scores with the V\nH \nscores simply reduced the trending observed for the V\nH \nscores alone. Unlike the V\nH \nscoring results, the human V\nκ\n consensus scores were not in line with the natural abundance of V\nκ\n germlines and gene usage (Guigou et al., 1990; Meindl et al., 1990; Cox et al., 1994); even though the consensus scores themselves all scored better than their individual human kappa subclass sequences (\nFIG. 72B\n). It is only speculation that these deviations from the expected order of V\nκ\n consensus scores may deter the mammalian databases' ability to accurately predict low stability V\nκ\n domains. Also, there were not \nenough V\n \n \n \nκ\n2 sequences for defining the \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n2 subclass average score. After subclass distributions were determined for the 68 human V\nκ\n sequences, only 4 were V\nκ\n2 (which reflects \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n2 usage pretty well). Even with these drawbacks, the V\nκ\n results still suggest that the greater sequence diversity of V\nH \ngenes may, more often than not, make V\nH \ndomains the stability-determining component of Fabs (Demarest et al., 2006); although examples of the opposite are available in the literature (Röthlisberger et al., 2006).\n\n\nD. Stability Dependence Upon V\nH \nor V\nL \nGermline and V\nH\n/V\nL \nPairing\n\n\nMany of the 18 antibodies contained overlapping germlines V-genes whose CDRs and hypersomatic mutations varied and whose V\nH \nor V\nκ\n pairing was the same or different. This allowed for a comparison of antibody Fab stabilities against the individual germlines from which they were derived. The two most stable Fabs, BIIB1 and BIIB2, have the \nsame V\n \n \n \nH\n1 and \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n1 germline combinations. V\nH \nand V\nκ\n pairings do not appear to have clear intrinsic biases based on a study by Winter and coworkers, but are believed to be “receptor driven” (de Wildt et al., 1999b). BIIB1 and BIIB2 bind relatively dissimilar antigens, CCL2 and VLA4; therefore, the combination either occurred randomly or was the result of humanization. There was a clear abundance of non-optimal amino-acids within the V\nH \ndomains of the least stable Fabs, BIIB17 and BII18 (i.e. low sequence scores and BIIB18 contained an unusual insertion). Both of these antibodies also contained the \nsame V\n \n \n \nκ\n2 germline, potentially suggesting light chain protein stability issues on top of the V\nH\n-based issues identified by the scoring. An interesting future study would be to determine whether this \nparticular V\n \n \n \nκ\n2 was a contributor to the poor biophysical behavior of these two antibodies. \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n2 subclass in general was not associated with poor Fab stabilities as BIIB3 and BIIB4 also contain a \nV\n \n \n \nκ\n2 subclass gene. The \nAB019438V\n \n \n \nH\n1 germline (Lefranc et al., 1999) cropped up four times. The T\nM\n-values for these Fabs (BIIB12, BIIB11, BIIB7 and BIIB3) ranged from 71.2 to 78.2. Interestingly, their V\nH \nsequence scores correlated with their apparent Fab stabilities (BIIB12<BIIB11<BIIB7≈BIIB3). A positive V\nH \nscoring correlation was also found in the BIIB1 and BIIB2 antibodies described above with the \nsame V\n \n \n \nH\n1 germline. The apparent imprecision of the V\nH \nscoring, however, was emphasized by a negative stability correlation observed for BIIB4 and BIIB6 which both contained the \nM99649V\n \n \n \nH\n3 germline.\n\n\nWhile usage of V\nH \ngermline families in adult humans appears to be fairly random, the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 family contains the most members in humans. \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 or V\nH\n3-like genes stochastically appeared more often in the human reference set and the mammalian database. Ewert and Plückthun's results demonstrated that a consensus-derived \nhuman V\n \n \n \nH\n3 sequence was the most stable of the consensus-derived V\nH \ndomains (Ewert and Pluckthun, 2003). This result may not be entirely unexpected considering the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 subclass has more germline sequences to contribute to the creation of an optimal consensus compared to the other subclasses. Our stability data shows that \nIgGs containing V\n \n \n \nH\n3 germlines do not in general exhibit higher Fab T\nM\n-values. There are \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 and \nV\n \n \n \nH\n1 subclass genes at both the top and bottom of the stability list. While many other factors contribute to the overall stability of the Fab, especially the properties of the V\nκ\n counterpart within the Fv, one might expect a trend towards higher Fab stabilities for those containing \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 subclass germlines if the \nV\n \n \n \nH\n3 domains in general were more stable than the other subclasses. This does not appear to be the case from the limited stability studies described here.\n\n\nExample 17\n\n\nCovariation Analysis of Ig-Fold Polypeptides\n\n\nA. Collecting and Filtering Ig-Fold Structures\n\n\nStructures of Ig-Fold proteins or Ig-Fold domains from multidomain proteins were gathered from the ASTRAL database, which contains domain structures matching the SCOP hierarchy. Immunoglobulin specific Ig-domains were found under the following classifications within the SCOP hierarchy: “All beta proteins”→“Immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich”→“Immunoglobulin”. Under immunoglobulin, four sets of structures were available: “V set,” “C1 set,” “C2 set,” and “I set.” Four custom download scripts were separately run to obtain “V-class”, “C1-class”, “I-class”, and “C2-class” pdb files.\n\n\nOnce the structure files for each subfamily were downloaded, some filtering performed to remove erroneously categorized, incomplete, redundant, or domain-swapped structures (Liu Y, et al., \nProtein Sci\n. (2002), 1285-1299). There were 4 main filtering steps, described below:\n\n\n \nStep #\n1. Removal Sequences that have Breaks\n\n\nStructures from each subclass were visually inspected, using SwissPDB Viewer, for breaks in sequence (either unresolved densities or missing sections due to domain swapping). The PDB files of faulty structures were manually removed from the V-, C1-, C2-, and I-class structure datasets.\n\n\n \nStep #\n2. Removal of 100% Identical Sequences\n\n\nPDB format structures were converted to FASTA format amino acid sequences, and filtered to remove any sequences that were either 100% identical to, or perfect match substrings of, remaining sequences.\n\n\n \nStep #\n3. Removal of Sequences of Aberrant Length\n\n\nPDB structures with aberrantly long or short amino acid sequences were removed from the structure datasets. The length cutoff criteria were determined by examining the histogram of all sequence lengths (\nFIG. 74\n). The histograms appeared somewhat normally distributed. Sequences outside two standard deviations from the mean were removed from each subfamily dataset. The overall mean number of residues for the immunoglobulin superfamily was 106.10 and the standard deviation was 12.19. Consequently, the global cutoffs used were <=81 and >=131 residues. A breakdown of the mean lengths and standard deviations is shown in Table 21.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 21\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSequence Length Criteria of Structure Datasets\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubclass\n \nAverage Length\n \nStandard Deviation\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nC1\n \n99.44\n \n8.79\n \n \n \n \n \nC2\n \n88.07\n \n15.14\n \n \n \n \n \nI\n \n95.5\n \n4.94\n \n \n \n \n \nV\n \n111.95\n \n10.62\n \n \n \n \n \nOverall\n \n106.10\n \n12.19\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nStep #\n4. Removal of Misfolded Sequences\n\n\n\nThe structures were visually inspected, using SwissPDB Viewer, for misfolding. Any structures that did not conform to the two beta-sheet sandwich topology were discarded. Since only five C2-class domains were obtained from SCOP, C2-subclass Ig-Folds were not pursued further. Hereafter, C1-class is referred to as C-class.\n\n\nB. Obtaining Sequence Alignments from Structure Alignments\n\n\nFor each separate class, the Ig-Fold structures were superimposed upon one another using Secondary Structure Matching (SSM) within the Schrödinger structalign package (See Schrödinger Prime program documentation for instructions on creating superpositions). Superpositions were performed on an ‘all-to-all’ or an ‘all-to-one’ basis. Each algorithm led to similar quality alignments, so ‘all-to-one’ was chosen for the superpositions. Some superimpositions were corrected to insure that the core regions of each structure were superimposed instead of the loops. The superimpositions were then used to generate structure-based sequence alignments of all the V-class, I-class, and C-class sequences within each structural alignment. Alignment of each sequence onto another was performed using the Schrödinger package by matching amino acids from one sequence to that of second sequence based on the shortest distance between α-carbons of the polypeptide backbones.\n\n\nC. Construction of a Curated Ig-Fold Sequence Database\n\n\nA number of defined steps were created to generate a curated Ig-Fold dataset for calculating robust covariation statistics:\n\n\n \nStep #\n1. Construction of HMM Profiles\n\n\nThree Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profiles were built, each based upon the structure-based sequence alignments for one of the three Ig-Fold classes. The profiles were created with the HMMER software package (version 1.8), using the commands “hmmbuild” and “hmmcalibrate” with standard options. These HMMs were then used to detect and align additional Ig-Fold sequences in the NR-database maintained at the NCBI.\n\n\n \nStep #\n2. Searching NR Using the New V-, I-, and C-class HMM Profiles.\n\n\nThe three class-specific HMMs were used to search for similar sequences in a local NR database. The NR database is a large file containing 3 million non-redundant protein sequences. For each of the V-, I-, and C-class HMMs, the HMMER command “hmmsearch” was used to search NR. Each output ranked NR sequences by their scores relative to the HMM used, and provided information about the number of regions hit by the HMM and the positions of the hit regions within each NR sequence. For each Ig-Fold class-specific HMM search, hit NR sequences above a recommended criterion score threshold were retained as candidate members of the Ig-Fold class whose HMM was used. For those hit regions that were subsequences of an NR sequence, the exact NR subsequence hit was extracted from the full NR sequence using a custom program.\n\n\n \nStep #\n3. Validation of Ig-Fold Class Assignment Using PFAM.\n\n\nPFAM is a protein family and domain classification tool, created and maintained at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Fin, et al., \nNuc. Acids. Res\n., (2006), 34: D247-D251), that can be applied to individual protein sequences. A Pfam tool ‘pfamverify’ was applied to each Ig-Fold candidate sequence obtained in \nstep\n 2 above, to confirm that it was correctly classified by the Ig-Fold class-specific HMMs created from the structure-based sequence alignments. PFAM's Ig-clan HMM profiles (including V-, I-, C1, C2-, and less specific Ig HMMs) were downloaded from the PFAM website. Each sequence from NR was scored by the Ig-clan HMMs, revealing how well each sequence conforms to each PFAM HMM. Sequences whose scores lay below recommended cutoffs (TC1—defined at the PFAM website) for the V-, I-, or C-classes were removed from the respective sequence sets. Thus, the candidate class-specific Ig-Fold sequences found in \nstep\n 2 were retained only if their PFAM scores validated their Ig-Fold class assignments.\n\n\n \nStep #\n4. Aligning the New Ig-Fold Sequences.\n\n\nThe Ig-Fold sequences that were pulled from NR with HMM searches and that survived \nstep\n 3 above, were next aligned to our custom HMMs of their assigned class. Since these HMMs had been based upon careful structural alignments, this process insured a structure-guided alignment of the new sequences. The HMMER package was utilized to generate ‘mapali’ alignments in fasta output format, to be used in the Sequence Covariation Tool described below. The alignments were also output in ‘Stockholm’ output format, and inspected for aberrant or misaligned sequences, which were manually omitted. The resulting alignments, consisting of the original structurally-aligned sequences and the added HMM-aligned sequences from NR, contained the following numbers of sequences: ˜50,000 V-class; ˜10,000 C-class; ˜10,000 I-class.\n\n\n \nStep #\n5. Removing Redundant or Similar Sequences.\n\n\nWe expected these alignments to be biased towards frequently observed sequences, with under-representation of rare sequences and a consequent masking of sequence diversity. For example, we expected a large bias in the V-class Ig-Fold sequence alignment towards murine and human immunoglobulin variable domains. Since over-representation of particular sequence types limits the usefulness of covariation analyses, a filtering tool was created and applied to reduce the alignment redundancy. The tool used a novel heuristic algorithm to find sequences with >80% identity to one another, and removed them from the alignments. In brief, percent identities were calculated for all sequence pairs. The identity values were then grouped into bins of percent identity (i.e. 99% bin, 98% bin, 97% bin, etc.). During the reduction of each bin, the sequences of each bin were ranked by decreasing non-gap residue count, and then by their Henikoff sequence weight (Henikoff S and Henikoff J G, \nJ. Mol. Biol\n., (1994), 243: 184-199). After this step, the remaining number of sequences in each alignment were: 2,786 V-class; 1,587 I-class; and 518 C-class.\n\n\n \nStep #\n6. Removal of Gaps to Create the Final Alignments\n\n\nIn the final alignments, columns that were not match states in the HMM profile used to find these sequences (see HMMER manual) were removed. Therefore, while many of the sequences contain more amino acids than the final alignment length, the lengths were truncated to avoid calculations on the less informative gap regions of the alignment. The final numbers of residues (including gaps) within the alignments were 144 for the V-class, 60 for the I-class, and 111 for the C-class.\n\n\nD. General Description of the Final Alignments\n\n\na) V-Class\n\n\nAfter the final 80% filter was applied, the 2,786 V-class sequences could be divided into three categories: (1) Immunoglobulin variable gene class, 49%, which include both the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of diverse immunoglobulins; (2) T-Cell Receptor V-class genes, 16%, which contained the hypervariable domains; and (3) Other V-class genes, 35%. The Immunoglobulin V-class genes come from a huge variety of species ranging from cartilaginous fish to primates. There was a bias towards human V-class sequences (537 of the 1272 sequences). However, other vertebrate species were only minimally represented: mouse (33), cow (5), camel (23), llama (31), macaque (17), chicken (6), etc. The T-cell receptor set of sequences was nearly as diverse ranging from fish to primate and did not contain a bias towards human sequences. The “Other” category comprised a large number of diverse sequences with no real subcategories comprising over 1-2% of the remaining sequences. The “Other” category contained an even wider array of species including chordates (primarily), cartilaginous fish, cephalopods, and insects.\n\n\nb) C-Class\n\n\nAfter the final 80% filter was applied, the 518 C-class sequences could be divided into three categories: (1) Immunoglobulin constant domains, 44%; (2) MHC-type Ig-Folds, 21%; and (3) Other C-class Ig-Folds, 35%. The Immunoglobulin constant domain category contained diverse sequences ranging from cartilaginous fish to primates. The C-class immunoglobulin subcategory was not biased by primate or even mammalian sequences (only 3 human sequences remained unfiltered: IgE-\nC\n \n \n \nH\n4, a kappa C\nL\n, and a lambda C\nL\n). The MHC subcategory also ranged from cartilaginous fish to primates and also showed little bias towards one evolutionary group. The “Other” C-class category contained many unknown proteins, a very small subcategory of various beta-2-microglobulins, and many other proteins that were not observed with a frequency deserved of a subcategory.\n\n\nc) I-Class\n\n\nThe I-class did not have any clear subcategories. Titan or titan-like molecules cropped up commonly as did cell-adhesion or cell-adhesion-like molecules.\n\n\nE. Calculation of Covariation Statistics\n\n\nCorrelation strength (in terms of a φ-value) and significance (in terms of a χ\n2\n-value) of covariations between all possible pairs of amino acids in the alignments was calculated based on art-recognized methods, but included the following variations: 1) Gaps were included as a distinct residue type; (2) the Henikoff weighing scheme was not performed; (3) Sequence Average Identities (SAI) were not used to filter out covarying pairs; (4) χ\n2 \nvalues were calculated using event based counts (number of occurrences), rather than frequencies; and (5) covarying pairs were not reported by the program unless they were observed a minimum number of times. Two bodies of statistics were created, the first (and smaller set) with an event cutoff of 10 and a second (much larger set) with an event cutoff of 6 events. The ability to calculate these parameters on any given sequence alignment was encoded into a Java executable and tested with Java Runtime Engine (JRE) version 1.4.2.\n\n\nBased on the number of positions within the alignment and a total of 23 possible residues at each position (including gaps, B, and Z ambiguous residues), there were 2.4 million correlations calculated for the C-class, 700 thousand calculated for the I-class, and 4.1 million calculated for the V-class. \nFIG. 75\n shows the φ values calculated for the V-class with high χ\n2 \nsignificance. φ values range from −1 to +1. As positive φ values move away from 0 (i.e. toward +1), the strength of the correlation (i.e. the covariation) between two amino acids at defined positions within the alignments increases. Negative correlations (i.e. the presence of one amino acid at one site in the alignment forcing the absence of another specific amino acid at a second site) increase as φ values move towards −1. Cutoffs for what is a real covariation are somewhat arbitrary, but those with a φ value >0.5 are strongly correlated with one another. Thus, according to \nFIG. 75\n, only 370 of the possible 2.4 million correlations within the C-class are strong. However, correlations above 0.3 have been reported as important and would increase the number of positive correlations observed for all three classes by 10-fold. These correlations represent the very small, but important piece of the dataset that is used for further analyses, generating protein designs, or prediction of functional residue positions.\n\n\nF. Validation of Covariation Statistics\n\n\nThere were several criteria used to validate that the strong covariations that were derived from the Ig-Fold database were significant and meaningful apart from the statistical strengths based on the calculations. The first was to analyze whether there was a trend between residues that covaried with one another and their proximity inside Ig-Folds of known structure. Previous studies in the literature have demonstrated that a correlation between covarying positions and their proximity to one another do exist—although they are very weak—in agreement with our results. A second criterion looked at whether the Ig-Fold covariation calculations generated known connections between amino acid positions that have already been reported to exist within known Ig-Fold subsets. One clear test case was at N-terminus of human/murine IgG variable heavy chain folds (part of the V-class). Residues 6-10 are known to adopt very specific conformations based on the conservation of covarying pairs of amino acids (Ewert S, et al., \nMethods\n, (2004), 24: 184-199). Two of the three reported pairs of covarying amino acids were found to have φ values above 0.3—well above the apparent background of the dataset.\n\n\nExample 18\n\n\nPreparation of a PRIMATIZED® p5E8 Tetravalent Antibody Comprising a Conventional p5E8 scFv\n\n\nPRIMATIZED® p5E8G1 is a chimeric macaque/human (PRIMATIZED®) monoclonal antibody containing macaque heavy and light variable regions fused to \nhuman gamma\n 1 and kappa constant regions, respectively. PRIMATIZED® p5E8G1 binds to human CD23, the low affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRII) (Mavromatis and Cheson. 2003. J. Clin. Oncol. 21:1874; US Patent Application 20030059424). A tetravalent PRIMATIZED® p5E8 antibody was constructed using a similar strategy as that described in Examples 1-8.

Correct sequences were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Plasmid DNA was used to transform CHO DG44 cells for stable production of antibody protein. \nFIG. 80\n shows the DNA sequence of heavy chain C-terminal tetravalent PRIMATIZED® p5E8 antibody comprising a conventional scFv. \nFIG. 81\n shows the amino acid sequence of heavy chain C-terminal tetravalent PRIMATIZED® p5E8 antibody comprising a conventional scFv. \nFIG. 82A\n shows the DNA sequence of PRIMATIZED® p5E8 light chain. \nFIG. 82B\n shows the amino acid sequence of PRIMATIZED® p5E8 light chain.\n\n\nExample 19\n\n\nPreparation of PRIMATIZED® p5E8 scFv and Fab Proteins\n\n\nPRIMATIZED® p5E8 scFvs in both orientations (VL→(Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinker→VH (VL/VH) and VH→(Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinker→VL (VH/VL)) were subcloned by PCR amplification from plasmids described in U.S. Patent Application 20050163782.

PCR products corresponding to the expected sizes were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, excised, and purified using the Millipore Ultrafree-DA extraction kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Millipore; Bedford, Mass.). The purified PCR products were subsequently digested with Nde I and Sal I and cloned into the Nde I/Sal I sites of a modified \nE. coli \nexpression vector designed to drive recombinant protein expression under the control of an inducible ara C promoter. The expression vector contained a modification encoding a unique Nde I site overlapping the start codon of the BHA10 scFv.

Purified Fab was concentrated to between 2-11 mg/mL. Fab concentrations were determined using an ε\n280 nm\n=1.5 mL mg\n−1 \ncm\n−1\n.\n\n\nExample 20\n\n\nThermal Stability of Conventional p5E8 scFv Antibodies\n\n\nSince an excellent correlation has been observed between T50 values obtained using the thermal challenge assay described in Examples 4 and 5 and Tm values calculated by DSC analysis (r\n2\n=0.93), a thermal challenge assay was employed to evaluate the relative thermal stabilities of the p5E8 (VL/VH) and p5E8 (VH/VL) scFvs. The thermal challenge assay was utilized as described in Examples 4 and 5 except that soluble CD23 antigen at 1 ug/ml was used to coat the plates and the concentration of the Eu-labelled anti-6 His antibody (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass., Cat. #AD0109) was increased to 250 ng/ml. Results from this assay determined the T50 value of p5E8 (VL/VH) to be 38° C. and p5E8 (VH/VL) to be slightly lower at 34° C. (\nFIG. 85\n). Given the remarkably low T50 values of both scFvs and the observation that of the two p5E8 (VL/VH) was slightly more thermally stabile, p5E8 (VL/VH) was selected for further stability engineering.\n\n\nExample 21\n\n\nConstruction of p5E8 scFv Molecules with Improved Thermal Stability\n\n\nIndividual variants and libraries designed to contain the desired amino acid replacements in the conventional p5E8 (VL/VH) scFv using the methods described in Examples 3 and 5 were created as previously described using oligonucleotides listed in Table 23.\n\n\nIn Table 23, each oligonucleotide name gives reference to amino acid substitutions at position(s) in VH or VL according to Kabat numbering system. “Rationale” refers to the design method employed. Said methods are described in detail in Example 5 supra. Mutagenic residues are shown as capital letters. Oligonucleotide pairs for introducing VH/VL disulfides are boxed. Abbreviations are: “COMP”-Computational Analysis, “COVAR”—Covariation Analysis, “CONS”—Consensus Scoring, “INTER-VH/VL” Interface Design, “SS”—VH/VL disulfide bond, and “TBD”—to be

Ambiguous bases are abbreviated as follows: W = A or T, V = A or C or G, Y = C or T, S = C or G, M = A or C, N = A or C or G or T, R = A or G, K = G or T, B = C or G or T (J Biol Chem. 261(1): 13-7 (1986)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual transformed colonies were picked into deep-well 96 well dishes, processed, and screened according to the methods detailed in Example 5. Transformants were grown overnight in expression media consisting of SB (Teknova, Half Moon Bay, Ca. Cat. #S0140) supplemented with 0.6% glycine, 0.6% Triton X100, 0.02% arabinose, and 50 μg/ml carbenicillin at either 37° C. or 32° C.\n\n\nAfter thermal challenge, the aggregated material was removed by centrifugation and assayed in the soluble CD23 DELFIA as described in Example 3. Assay data was processed using Spotfire DecisionSite software (Spotfire, Somerville, Mass.) and expressed as the ratio of the DELFIA counts observed at challenge temperature to the reference temperature for each clone. Clones that reproducibly gave ratios greater than or equal to twice what was observed for the parental plasmid were considered hits. Plasmid DNAs from these positive clones were isolated by mini-prep (Wizard Plus, Promega, Madison, Wis.) and retransformed back into \nE. coli \nW3110 for confirmation secondary thermal challenge assays as well as for DNA sequence determination.\n\n\nPrimary and confirmatory results from these assays are shown in Table 24. Several of the stabilized scFv molecules of the invention resulted in improvements in binding activity (T\n50\n>38° C.) as compared with the conventional p5E8 scFv. In particular, the T\n50 \nvalues of p5E8 library position V\nH\n6 (E6Q), library position V\nH\n49 (S49G and S49A), library position V\nH\n43 (Q43K), library positions V\nH\n72 (E72D and E72N), and library position V\nH\n79 (F79S), exhibited increases in thermal stability ranging from +4° C. to +5° C. relative to the conventional p5E8 scFv. The T\n50 \nvalues of p5E8 library position V\nL\n50 (V50D and V50S), library position V\nL\n75 (V751), library position V\nL\n80 (P80S), and library positions V\nL\n83 (F83A, F83G, F83S and F83T), exhibited increases in thermal stability ranging from +3° C. to +7° C. relative to the conventional p5E8 scFv.\n\n\nIn addition, the T\n50 \nvalues of p5E8 library position V\nH\n32 (N32S) and library position V\nH\n79 (F79Y) exhibited increases in thermal stability of +2° C. relative to the conventional p5E8 scFv.\n\n\nStabilizing mutations were identified using an assortment of the design methods described in Example 5—the V\nH\n6 (E6Q), V\nL\n75 (V75I), V\nL\n80 (P80S) and V\nL\n83 (F83A, F83G, F83S and F83T) mutations were derived using Computational Analysis, the V\nH\n32 (N32S) mutation was derived using Consensus Scoring, and the four mutations V\nH\n49 (S49G and S49A), V\nH\n43 (Q43K), V\nH\n72 (E72D and E72N), the V\nH\n79 (F79S and F79Y) mutations were derived using Covariation Analysis, and the V\nL\n50 (V50D and V50S) mutations were derived using VH/VL interface analysis, validating the utility and novelty of these design tools.

Construction of N\nH\n-p5E8 Tetravalent Antibody\n\n\nThe p5E8 scFvs DNAs described in Example 21 are used to construct an N\nH\n-p5E8 tetravalent antibody similar to that described in Example 7 supra. A (Gly\n4\nSer)\n5 \nlinker is used to connect the p5E8 scFv to the mature amino terminus of PRIMATIZED® p5E8 IgG heavy chain. The organization of the molecule is a p5E8 scFv-(Gly4Ser)\n5 \nlinker-PRIMATIZED® p5E8 IgG heavy chain. This molecule assembles with the light chain to form the tetravalent antibody. The correct sequence would be confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The construct could be used for transfecting CHO cells as described in Example 8 for scaled-up production of a N\nH\n-p5E8 Tetravalent Antibody. Transfected CHO cells can be screened for binding to immobilized CD23 antigen by DELFIA assay. 96-well plates. For example, (MaxiSorp, Nalge Nunc, Rochester, N.Y., Cat. #437111) can be coated with soluble CD23 antigen at 1 ug/ml in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5. Plates are coated overnight at 4° C., and blocked with DELFIA assay buffer (DAB, 10 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 0.5% BSA, 0.02\n% Tween\n 20, 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.4) for one hour with shaking at room temperature. Plates are washed 3 times with DAB without BSA (Wash buffer), and test samples diluted in DAB added to the plates in a final volume of 100 ul. The plates are incubated for one hour with shaking at room temperature, and then washed 3 times with Wash buffer to remove unbound material. Bound antibody is detected by addition of 100 ul per well of DAB containing 250 ng/ml of Eu-labeled anti-human antibody (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass., Cat. #1244-330) and incubated at room temperature with shaking for one hour. The plates are washed 3 times with Wash buffer, and 100 ul of DELFIA enhancement solution (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass., Cat. #4001-0010) is added per well. Following incubation for 15 minutes, the plates are read using the Europium method on a \nVictor\n 2 plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.).\n\n\nB. Construction of C-p5E8 Tetravalent Antibody\n\n\nThe p5E8 scFvs DNAs described in Example 21 supra are used to construct a C-p5E8 tetravalent antibody as described in Example 7 supra. A Ser(Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinker peptide is used to connect the p5E8 scFv to the carboxy terminus of PRIMATIZED® p5E8 IgG heavy chain. The organization of the molecule is a PRIMATIZED® p5E8 IgG heavy chain-Ser(Gly\n4\nSer)\n3 \nlinker-p5E8 scFv. This molecule assembles with the light chain to form the tetravalent antibody. The correct sequence would be confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The construct could be used for transfecting CHO cells as described in Example 8 for scaled-up production of a C-p5E8 Tetravalent Antibody. Transfected CHO cells can be screened as described above.\n\n\nEQUIVALENTS\n\n\nThose skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments of the invention described herein.
