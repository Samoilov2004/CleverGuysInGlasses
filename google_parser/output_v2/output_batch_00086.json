Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a novel amide derivative. More particularly, the present invention relates to a homocysteine synthase inhibitor comprising an amide derivative or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, or a solvate thereof as an active ingredient.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nHomocysteine is a sulfur amino acid, and is an important intermediate for the metabolism of an essential amino acid, methionine. Homocysteine is maintained at an extremely low concentration in the cell, and redundant homocysteine is extracellularly released, i.e., into the blood. Thirty years ago, Dr. McCully reported that homocysteine causes vascular pathology such as arteriosclerosis and myocardial infarction (non-patent document 1). Thereafter, clinical tests verified that patients having arteriosclerosis in the peripheral vessel or cerebral vessel show high homocysteine values (non-patent document 2). In almost any clinical tests thereafter, a correlation between increased homocysteine value and cerebral infarction has been reported (non-patent documents 3-8). In a large scale test, it was reported that when the blood homocysteine value increases by 25% (3 μM in absolute value), the risk of coronary artery disease increases by 10%, and the risk of cerebral infarction increases by 20% (non-patent document 9), and it is now suggested that homocysteine is an independent risk factor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt present, as a homocysteine-decreasing therapy, only an ingestion of a coenzyme of metabolic enzyme, i.e., vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folic acid, has been tried. Ingestion of these vitamins decreases the blood homocysteine value to some extent (non-patent document 10). Moreover, improvement in the vascular endothelial function and regression of carotid plaque by a vitamin therapy have been reported (non-patent documents 11-13).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, in a large scale test aiming to examine an influence of vitamin therapy on the recurrence of cerebral infarction or myocardial infarction (The Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP)), a recurrence preventive effect was not observed. The cause thereof is suggested to be the absence of a sufficient decrease in homocysteine by a vitamin therapy (non-patent document 14). This report has also clarified that the risk of recurrence of cerebral infarction can be decreased by 10% and the risk of myocardial infarction can be decreased by 26%, when the baseline of homocysteine value is lower by 3 μM. If the homocysteine value could be certainly decreased than the vitamin therapy, the onset of these events is expected to be suppressed significantly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enzyme that synthesizes homocysteine in the body is S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine Hydrolase (hereinafter sometimes to be referred to as “SAHH”) alone. This enzyme controls a reaction to hydrolyze S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine (hereinafter sometimes to be referred to as “SAH”) into Adenosine (hereinafter sometimes to be referred to as “Ado”) and Homocysteine (hereinafter sometimes to be referred to as “Hcy”) and a reversible reaction to conversely synthesize SAH from Adenosine and Homocysteine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, as a compound showing an SAHH inhibitory action, an adenine derivative (patent document 1) and a nitroprusside compound (patent document 2) have been reported. However, they have completely different structures from the structure of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, patent documents 3-7 report amide compounds. However, these reports do not disclose the present invention, and an SAHH inhibitory action is not reported (patent documents 3-7).\n\n\n \nPRIOR ART DOCUMENTS\n\n\nPatent Documents\n\n\n \n\n\n \n

That is, a competitive inhibitor is bound to an enzyme substrate binding site instead of a substrate and reversibly inhibits enzyme activity. Therefore, even when a competitive inhibitor is present, the inhibitory activity disappears by sufficiently increasing the substrate concentration. The inhibitory constant Ki is defined to be [E][I]/[EI].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe second reversible inhibition is a noncompetitive inhibition, where an inhibitor does not influence free enzymes and the substrate-enzyme binding stage. It reversibly binds only to enzyme-substrate complex (ES) to show an inhibitory action. Therefore, an increased substrate concentration does not influence the inhibition intensity. In this case, the inhibitory constants Ki is [ES][I]/[ESI]. [ESI] is a concentration of enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe third reversible inhibition is an uncompetitive inhibition, wherein the inhibitor reversibly binds a free enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex to show an inhibitory action. An uncompetitive inhibitor binds an enzyme at a moiety different from the substrate binding site, and achieves inhibition by changing the molecular structure of the enzyme. In this case, two inhibitory constants Ki of Ki\nEI\n=[E][I]/[EI] and Ki\nESI\n=[ES][I]/[ESI] are present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese inhibitory modes can be determined by Lineweaver-Burk Plotplot.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the present specification, the “disease relating to homocysteine synthase” refers to a disease whose symptoms are expected to be prevented or improved by reversible inhibition of the homocysteine synthase activity.

The measurement method was modification of the method of Henry H. Richards et al. (J. Biol. Chem. 253, 4476-4480, 1978). That is, S-Adenosyl-L-Homocysteine (10 μM) and Adenosine Deaminase (Roche) (4 units) were added to 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2, containing 1 mM EDTA) with the total amount being 200 μl, and to the solution were added a test substance and then Human-recombinant-S-Adenosyl-L-Homocysteine Hydrolase (50 ng, Diazyme Laboratories) to start the reaction, and the mixture was incubated at 37° C. for 15 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 1N aqueous perchloric solution (20 μl), and the mixture was centrifuged under the conditions of 10000 rpm, 5 min, 4° C. The supernatant was collected, and the amount of S-Adenosyl-L-Homocysteine after the reaction was quantified by HPLC. The column used was a reversed-phase column.

The plasma homocysteine concentration was measured by treating the plasma with tributylphosphine, removing protein with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), fluorescent labeling the supernatant with 4-fluoro-7-sulfobenzofurazan ammonium salt (SBD-F) under alkali conditions, and quantifying by HPLC. The homocysteine synthesis inhibitory rate of the sample was determined with the difference in the homocysteine value between methionine water-loaded animal and methionine water-unloaded animal as 100%.
