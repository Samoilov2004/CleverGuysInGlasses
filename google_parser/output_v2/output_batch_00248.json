The novel iminothiadiazine dioxide compounds of the invention have surprisingly been found to exhibit properties which are expected to render them \n\n\nadvantageous as BACE inhibitors and/or for the treatment and prevention of various pathologies related to β-amyloid (\" Αβ\") production. \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\n Amyloid beta peptide (\"Αβ\") is a primary component of β amyloid fibrils and plaques, which are regarded as having a role in an increasing number of pathologies. Examples of such pathologies include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, Parkinson's disease, memory loss (including memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease and \n\n\nParkinson's disease), attention deficit symptoms (including attention deficit symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease (\"AD\"), Parkinson's disease, and Down's syndrome), dementia (including pre-senile dementia, senile dementia, dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Down's syndrome), progressive supranuclear palsy, cortical basal degeneration, neurodegeneration, olfactory impairment (including olfactory impairment associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Down's syndrome), β-amyloid angiopathy (including cerebral amyloid angiopathy), hereditary cerebral hemorrhage, mild cognitive impairment (\"MCI\"), glaucoma, amyloidosis, type II diabetes, hemodialysis (β2 microglobulins and complications arising therefrom), neurodegenerative diseases such as scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalitis, Creutzfeld- Jakob disease, traumatic brain injury and the like. \n\n Αβ peptides are short peptides which are made from the proteolytic break-down of the transmembrane protein called amyloid precursor protein (\"APP\"). Αβ peptides are made from the cleavage of APP by β-secretase activity near the position near the N-terminus of Αβ, and by gamma-secretase activity at a position near the C-terminus of Αβ. (APP is also cleaved by a- secretase activity, resulting in the secreted, non-amyloidogenic fragment known as soluble APPa.) Beta site APP Cleaving Enzyme (\"BACE-1\") is regarded as the primary aspartyl protease responsible for the production of Αβ by β-secretase activity. The inhibition of BACE-1 has been shown to inhibit the production of Αβ. \n\n\n AD is estimated to afflict more than 20 million people worldwide and is believed to be the most common cause of dementia. AD is a disease characterized by degeneration and loss of neurons and also by the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Presently, treatment of Alzheimer's disease is limited to the treatment of its symptoms rather than the underlying causes. Symptom- improving agents approved for this purpose include, for example, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists such as memantine (Namenda®, Forrest \n\n\nPharmaceuticals, Inc.), cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil (Aricept®, Pfizer), rivastigmine (Exelon®, Novartis), galantamine (Razadyne Reminyl®), and tacrine (Cognex®). \n\n\n In AD, Αβ peptides, formed through β-secretase and gamma-secretase activity, can form tertiary structures that aggregate to form amyloid fibrils. Αβ peptides have also been shown to form Αβ oligomers (sometimes referred to as \"Αβ aggregates\" or \"Abeta oligomers\"). Αβ oligomers are small multimeric structures composed of 2 to 12 Αβ peptides that are structurally distinct from Αβ fibrils. Amyloid fibrils can deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques, neuritic plaques, or diffuse plaques in regions of the brain important to memory and cognition. Αβ oligomers are cytotoxic when injected in the brains of rats or in cell culture. This Αβ plaque formation and deposition and/or Αβ oligomer formation, and the resultant neuronal death and cognitive impairment, are among the hallmarks of AD \n\n\npathophysiology. Other hallmarks of AD pathophysiology include intracellular neurofibrillary tangles comprised of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein, and neuroinflammation. \n\n\n Evidence suggests that Αβ, Αβ fibrils, aggregates, oligomers, and/or plaque play a causal role in AD pathophysiology. (Ohno et al., Neurobiology of Disease, No. 26 (2007), 134-145). Mutations in the genes for APP and presenilins 1/2 (PS 1/2) are known to cause familial AD and an increase in the production of the 42-amino acid form of Αβ is regarded as causative. Αβ has been shown to be neurotoxic in culture and in vivo. For example, when injected into the brains \n\n of aged primates, fibrillar Αβ causes neuronal cell death around the injection site. Other direct and circumstantial evidence of the role of Αβ in Alzheimer etiology has also been published. \n\n\n BACE-1 has become an accepted therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. For example, McConlogue et aL, J. Bio. Chem., Vol. 282, No. 36 (Sept 2007), have shown that partial reductions of BACE-1 enzyme activity and concomitant reductions of Αβ levels lead to a dramatic inhibition of Αβ-driven AD-like pathology, making β-secretase a target for therapeutic intervention in AD. Ohno et al. Neurobiology of Disease, No. 26 (2007), 134- 145, report that genetic deletion of BACE-1 in 5XFAD mice abrogates Αβ generation, blocks amyloid deposition, prevents neuron loss found in the cerebral cortex and subiculum (brain regions manifesting the most severe amyloidosis in 5XFAD mice), and rescues memory deficits in 5XFAD mice. The group also reports that Αβ is ultimately responsible for neuron death in AD and concludes that B ACE- 1 inhibition has been validated as an approach for the treatment of AD. oberds et al, Human Mol. Genetics, 2001, Vol. 10, No. 12, 1317-1324, established that inhibition or loss of β-secretase activity produces no profound phenotypic defects while inducing a concomitant reduction in Αβ. Luo et al., Nature Neuroscience, Vol. 4, No. 3, March 2001, report that mice deficient in BACE-1 have normal phenotype and abolished β-amyloid generation. \n\n\n BACE-1 has also been identified or implicated as a therapeutic target for a number of other diverse, pathologies in which Αβ or Αβ fragments have been identified to play a causative role. One such example is in the treatment of AD-type symptoms of patients with Down's syndrome. The gene encoding APP is found on chromosome 21, which is also the chromosome found as an extra copy in Down's syndrome. Down's syndrome patients tend to acquire AD at an early age, with almost all those over 40 years of age showing Alzheimer' s-type pathology. This is thought to be due to the extra copy of the APP gene found in these patients, which leads to overexpression of APP and therefore to increased levels of Αβ causing the prevalence of AD seen in this population. Furthermore, Down's patients who have a duplication of a small region of chromosome 21 that does not include the APP gene do not develop AD pathology. Thus, it is thought that inhibitors of BACE-1 could be useful in reducing Alzheimer's type pathology in Down's syndrome patients. \n\n\n Another example is in the treatment of glaucoma (Guo et al., PNAS, Vol. 104, No. 33, August 14, 2007). Glaucoma is a retinal disease of the eye and a major cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Guo et al. report that Αβ colocalizes with apoptotic retinal ganglion cells \n\n (RGCs) ίη experimental glaucoma and induces significant RGC cell loss in vivo in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The group report having demonstrated that targeting different components of the Αβ formation and aggregation pathway, including inhibition of β-secretase alone and together with other approaches, can effectively reduce glaucomatous RGC apoptosis in vivo. Thus, the reduction of Αβ production by the inhibition of BACE-1 could be useful, alone or in combination with other approaches, for the treatment of glaucoma. \n\n\n Another example is in the treatment of olfactory impairment. Getchell et al., \n\n\nNeurobiology of Aging, 24 (2003), 663-673, have observed that the olfactory epithelium, a neuroepithelium that lines the posterior-dorsal region of the nasal cavity, exhibits many of the same pathological changes found in the brains of AD patients, including deposits of Αβ, the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and dystrophic neurites among others. Other evidence in this connection has been reported by Bacon AW, et al., Ann NY Acad Sci 2002; 855:723-31; Crino PB\n}\n Martin JA, Hill WD, et al., Ann Otol Rhinol Laryngol, 1995;104:655- 61; Davies DC, et al., Neurobiol Aging, 1993;14:353-7; Devanand DP, et al., Am J Psychiatr, 2000;157:1399-405; and Doty RL, et al, Brain Res Bull, 1987;18:597-600. It is reasonable to suggest that addressing such changes by reduction of Αβ by inhibition of BACE-1 could help to restore olfactory sensitivity in patients with AD. \n\n\n For compounds which are inhibitors of BACE-2, another example is in the treatment of type-II diabetes, including diabetes associated with amyloidogenesis. BACE-2 is expressed in the pancreas. BACE-2 immunoreactivity has been reported in secretory granules of beta cells, co-stored with insulin and IAPP, but lacking in the other endocrine and exocrine cell types. Stoffel et al., WO2010/063718, disclose the use of BACE-2 inhibitors in the treatment of metabolic diseases such as Type-H diabetes. The presence of BACE-2 in secretory granules of beta cells suggests that it may play a role in diabetes-associated amyloidogenesis. (Finzi, G. Franzi, et al., Ultrastruct Pathol 2008 Nov-Dec;32(6):246-51.) \n\n\n Other diverse pathologies characterized by the formation and deposition of Αβ or fragments thereof, and/or by the presence of amyloid fibrils, oligomers, and/or plaques, include neurodegenerative diseases such as scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalitis, traumatic brain injury (\"TBI\"), Creutzfeld- Jakob disease and the like, type II diabetes (which is characterized by the localized accumulation of cytotoxic amyloid fibrils in the insulin producing cells of the pancreas), and amyloid angiopathy. In this regard reference can be made to the patent literature. For example, Kong et al, US2008/0015180, disclose methods and compositions for treating \n\n amyloidosis with agents that inhibit Αβ peptide formation. As another example, Loane, et al. report the targeting of amyloid precursor protein secretases as therapeutic targets for traumatic brain injury. (Loane et al., \"Amyloid precursor protein secretases as therapeutic targets for traumatic brain injury\", Nature Medicine, Advance Online Publication, published online March 15, 2009.) Still other diverse pathologies characterized by the inappropriate formation and deposition of Αβ or fragments thereof, and/or by the presence of amyloid fibrils, and/or for which inhibitor(s) of BACE- 1 is expected to be of therapeutic value are discussed further hereinbelow. \n\n\n The therapeutic potential of inhibiting the deposition of Αβ has motivated many groups to characterize BACE-1 and to identify inhibitors of BACE- 1 and of other secretase enzyme inhibitors.

Examples of such moieties are rings such as heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, \n\n\nheterocycloalkyl, and heterocycloalkenyl rings. Additional non-limiting examples include methylene dioxy, ethylenedioxy, -C(C¾)\n2\n- and the like which form moieties such as, for example: \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n The line— as a bond generally indicates a mixture of, or either of, the possible isomers, e.g., containin (R)- and (S)- stereochemistry. For example: \n\n\n indicates a mixture of, or either of, and/or \n\n\nThe wavy line , as used herein, indicates a point of attachment to the rest of the compound. \n\n\n Lines drawn into the ring systems, such as, for example: \n\n\n\n\n\nindicate that the indicated line (bond) may be attached to any of the substitutable ring carbon atoms. \n\n\n \"Oxo\" is defined as a oxygen atom that is double bonded to a ring carbon in a cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, heterocyclyl, heterocyclenyl, or other ring described herein, e.g., \n\n\n\n\n\n In this specification, where there are multiple oxygen and/or sulfur atoms in a ring system, there cannot be any adjacent oxygen and/or sulfur present in said ring system. \n\n\n It is noted that the carbon atoms for compounds of the invention may be replaced with 1 to 3 silicon atoms so long as all valency requirements are satisfied. \n\n\n As well known in the art, a bond drawn from a particular atom wherein no moiety is depicted at the terminal end of the bond indicates a methyl group bound through that bond to the atom, unless stated otherwise. For example: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n In the compounds of Formula (I) \n\n\n The term \"purified\", \"in purified form\" or \"in isolated and purified form\" for a compound refers to the physical state of said compound after being isolated from a synthetic process (e.g. from a reaction mixture), or natural source or combination thereof. Thus, the term \"purified\", \"in purified form\" or \"in isolated and purified form\" for a compound refers to the physical state of said compound (or a tautomer or stereoisomer thereof, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate of said compound, said stereoisomer, or said tautomer) after being obtained from a purification process or processes described herein or well known to the skilled artisan (e.g., chromatography, recrystallization and the like), in sufficient purity to be suitable for in vivo or medicinal use and/or characterizable by standard analytical techniques described herein or well known to the skilled artisan. \n\n\n When a functional group in a compound is termed \"protected\", this means that the group is in modified form to preclude undesired side reactions at the protected site when the compound is subjected to a reaction. Suitable protecting groups will be recognized by those with ordinary skill in the art as well as by reference to standard textbooks such as, for example, T. W. Greene et al, Protective Groups in organic Synthesis (1991), Wiley, New York. \n\n\n As used herein, the term \"composition\" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. \n\n\n Prodrugs and solvates of the compounds of the invention are also contemplated herein. A discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems (1987) 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, (1987) Edward B. Roche, ed., American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press. The term \"prodrug\" means a compound (e.g, a drug precursor) that is transformed in vivo to yield a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound. The transformation may occur by various mechanisms (e.g., by metabolic or chemical processes), such as, for example, through hydrolysis in blood. A discussion of the use \n\n of prodrugs is provided by T. Higuchi and W. Stella, \"Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\" Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. \n\n\nEdward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1 87. \n\n\n For example, if a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group, a prodrug can comprise an ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as, for example, (Cf~C\n8\n)alkyl, (C2-Cs2)alkanoyloxy methyl, l-(alkanoyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms, 1 -methyl- l-{alkanoyloxy)-ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, 1 -(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, 1 -methyl- l-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, N-(alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-(N- (alkoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, 3-phthalidyl, 4-crotonolactonyl, gamma-butyrolacton-4~yl, di-N,N-(Ci-C2)alkylamino(C2-C3)alkyl (such as β- dimethylaminoethyl), carbamoyl-(Ci-C2)alkyl, N,N-di (Ci-C\n2\n)alkylcarbamoyl-(Cl-C2)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidino- or morpholino(C\n2\n-C\n3\n)alkyL and the like. \n\n\n Similarly, if a compound of the invention contains an alcohol functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as, for example, (Ci-Q)alkanoyloxymethyl, l-((Ci-C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1 -methyl- l-((Ci- C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (C i -C\n6\n)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N-(C i -C\n6\n) alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (Ci-C6)alkanoyl, a-amino(Ci-C\n4\n)alkanyl, arylacyl and a-aminoacyl, or a-aminoacyl- a-aminoacyl, where each a-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(0)(OH)\n2\n, -P(0)(0(Ci-C6)alkyl)\n2\n or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate), and the like. \n\n\n If a compound of the invention incorporates an amine functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as, for example, R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR'-carbonyl where R and R' are each independently (Q- Cio)alkyI, (C\n3\n-C\n7\n) cycloalkyl, benzyl, or R-carbonyl is a natural α-aminoacyl or natural a- aminoacyl, ^C(OH)C(0)OY\n1\n wherein Y\n1\n is H, (C C\n6\n)alkyl or benzyl,— C(OY\n2\n)Y\n3\n wherein Y\n2\n is (Ci-C\n4\n) alkyl and Y\n3\n is (Cj-C alkyl, carboxy (Ci-C6)alkyL amino(Ci-C4)alkyl or mono-N— or di-N,N-(C,-C\n6\n)alkylaminoalkyl,— C(Y )Y\n5\n wherein Y\n4\n is H or methyl and Y\n5\n is mono-N— or di-N,N-(Ci-C6)alkylamino morpholino, piperidin-l-yl or pyrrolidin-l-yl, and the like. \n\n One or more compounds of the invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms. \"Solvate\" means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. \"Solvate\" encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. Non-limiting examples of suitable solvates include ethanolates, methanolates, and the like. \"Hydrate\" is a solvate wherein the solvent molecule is H\n2\n0. \n\n\n One or more compounds of the invention may optionally be converted to a solvate. \n\n\nPreparation of solvates is generally known. Thus, for example, M. Caira et al, J. Pharmaceutical Sci., 93(3), 601-611 (2004) describe the preparation of the solvates of the antifungal fluconazole in ethyl acetate as well as from water. Similar preparations of solvates, hemisolvate, hydrates and the like are described by E. C. van Tonder et al, AAPS PharmSciTech., 5(1). article 12 (2004); and A. L. Bingham et al, Chem. Commun., 603-604 (2001). A typical, non-limiting, process involves dissolving the inventive compound in desired amounts of the desired solvent (organic or water or mixtures thereof) at a higher than ambient temperature, and cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals which are then isolated by standard methods. \n\n\nAnalytical techniques such as, for example I. R. spectroscopy, show the presence of the solvent (or water) in the crystals as a solvate (or hydrate). \n\n\n \"Effective amount\" or \"therapeutically effective amount\" is meant to describe an amount of compound or a composition of the present invention effective in inhibiting the above-noted diseases and thus producing the desired therapeutic, ameliorative, inhibitory or preventative effect. \n\n\n The compounds of the invention can form salts which are also within the scope of this invention. Reference to a compound of the invention herein is understood to include reference to salts thereof, unless otherwise indicated. The term \"salt(s)\", as employed herein, denotes acidic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids, as well as basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic bases. In addition, when a compound of the invention contains both a basic moiety, such as, but not limited to a pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety, such as, but not limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions (\"inner salts\") may be formed and are included within \n\n the term \"salt(s)\" as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful. Salts of the compounds of the invention may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of the invention with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization. \n\n\n Exemplary acid addition salts include acetates, ascorbates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates, fumarates, \n\n\nhydrochlorides, hydrobroraides, hydroiodides, lactates, maleates, methanesulfonates, \n\n\nnaphthalenesulfonates, nitrates, oxalates, phosphates, propionates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates, tartarates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates (also known as tosylates,) and the like. \n\n\nAdditionally, acids which are generally considered suitable for the formation of \n\n\npharmaceutically useful salts from basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, for example, by P. Stahl et al, Camille G. (eds.) Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts. Properties, Selection and Use. (2002) Zurich: Wiley-VCH; S. Berge et al, Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences (1977) 66(1) 1-19; P. Gould, InternationalJ. of Pharmaceutics (1986) 33 201-217; Anderson et al, The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry (1996), Academic Press, New York; and in The Orange Book (Food & Drug Administration, Washington, D.C. on their website). These disclosures are incorporated herein by reference thereto. \n\n\n Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases (for example, organic amines) such as dicyclohexylamines, t-butyl amines, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quarternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g. methyl, ethyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g. dimethyl, diethyl, and dibutyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g. decyl, lauryl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g. benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others. \n\n\n All such acid salts and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention. \n\n\n Pharmaceutically acceptable esters of the present compounds include the following groups: (1) carboxylic acid esters obtained by esterification of the hydroxy groups, in which the non-carbonyl moiety of the carboxylic acid portion of the ester grouping is selected from straight \n\n or branched chain alkyl (for example, acetyl, n-propyl, t-butyl, or n-butyl), alkoxyalkyl (for example, methoxymethyl), aralkyl (for example, benzyl), aryloxyalkyl (for example, \n\n\nphenoxymethyl), aryl (for example, phenyl optionally substituted with, for example, halogen, d. \n4\nalkyl, or Ci\n-4\nalkoxy or amino); (2) sulfonate esters, such as alkyl- or aralkylsulfonyl (for example, methanesulfonyl); (3) amino acid esters (for example, L-valyl or L-isoleucyl); (4) phosphonate esters and (5) mono-, di- or triphosphate esters. The phosphate esters may be further esterified by, for example, a C\n5\n.\n2\no alcohol or reactive derivative thereof, or by a 2,3-di (C\n<\ns\n-2\n )acyl glycerol. \n\n\n Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the invention may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of chiral HPLC column. \n\n\n It is also possible that the compounds of the invention may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are included in the invention. Thus, for \n\n\nexample, the compounds of the invention conforming to the formula:\n\n\n \n\n and their\n\n\n are both contemplated as being within the scope of the compounds of the invention. \n\n\n All stereoisomers (for example, geometric isomers, optical isomers and the like) of the present compounds (including those of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs of the compounds as well as the salts, solvates and esters of the prodrugs), such as those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on various substituents, including enantiomeric forms (which may exist even in the absence of asymmetric carbons), rotameric forms, atropisomers, and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention, as are positional isomers (such as, for example, 4-pyridyl and 3-pyridyl). (For example, if a compound of the invention incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are included in the invention.). \n\n\n Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may, for example, be substantially free of other isomers, or may be admixed, for example, as racemates or with all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention can have the S or configuration as defined by the lUPAC 191 Recommendations. The use of the terms \"salt\", \"solvate\", \"ester\", \"prodrug\" and the like, is intended to equally apply to the salt, solvate, ester and prodrug of enantiomers, stereoisomers, rotamers, tautomers, positional isomers, racemates or prodrugs of the inventive compounds. \n\n\n The present invention also embraces isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine and chlorine, such as ¾ \n3\nH, \n1\n C, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\n0, \n17\n0, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, and \n36\nC1, respectively. \n\n Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of the invention (e.g., those labeled with \n3\nH and \n!4\nC) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., \n3\nH) and carbon- 14 (i.e., \n1\n C) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., \n2\nH or D) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some \n\n\ncircumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples hereinbelow, by substituting an appropriate isotopically labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent. Non-limiting examples of deuterated compounds of the invention are described hereinbelow. \n\n\n Polymorphic forms of the compounds of the invention, and of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs of the compounds of the invention, are intended to be included in the present invention. \n\n\n Suitable doses for administering compounds of the invention to patients may readily be determined by those skilled in the art, e.g., by an attending physician, pharmacist, or other skilled worker, and may vary according to patient health, age, weight, frequency of \n\n\nadministration, use with other active ingredients, and/or indication for which the compounds are administered. Doses may range from about 0.001 to 500 mg/kg of body weight/day of the compound of the invention. In one embodiment, the dosage is from about 0.01 to about 25 mg kg of body weight/day of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate of said compound. In another embodiment, the quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted from about 1 mg to about 100 mg, preferably from about 1 mg to about 50 mg, more preferably from about 1 mg to about 25 mg, according to the particular application. In another embodiment, a typical recommended daily dosage regimen for oral administration can range from about 1 mg/day to about 500 mg/day, preferably 1 mg/day to 200 mg/day, in two to four divided doses. \n\n\n As discussed above, the amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of the invention and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated. \n\n When used in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents, the \n\n\ncompounds of this invention may be administered together or sequentially. When administered sequentially, compounds of the invention may be administered before or after the one or more additional therapeutic agents, as determined by those skilled in the art or patient preference. \n\n\n If formulated as a fixed dose, such combination products employ the compounds of this invention within the dosage range described herein and the other pharmaceutically active agent or treatment within its dosage range. \n\n\n Accordingly, in an aspect, this invention includes combinations comprising an amount of at least one compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, ester or prodrug thereof, and an effective amount of one or more additional agents described above. \n\n\n The pharmacological properties of the compounds of this invention may be confirmed by a number of pharmacological assays. Certain assays are exemplified elsewhere in this document. \n\n\n For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. The powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 95 percent active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are known in the art, e.g., magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar or lactose. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and methods of manufacture for various compositions may be found in A. Gennaro (ed.), Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18\nth\n Edition, (1990), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pennsylvania. \n\n\n Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injection or addition of sweeteners and opacifiers for oral solutions, suspensions and emulsions. Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal administration. \n\n\n Aerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as an inert compressed gas, e.g. nitrogen. \n\n\n Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. \n\n The compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions can take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose. \n\n\n The compounds of this invention may also be delivered subcutaneous ly. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the compound is administered orally. \n\n\n In some embodiments, it may be advantageous for the pharmaceutical preparation compring one or more compounds of the invention be prepared in a unit dosage form. In such forms, the preparation is subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose. PREPARATIVE EXAMPLES \n\n\n Compounds of the invention can be made using procedures known in the art. The following reaction schemes show typical procedures, but those skilled in the art will recognize that other procedures can also be suitable. \n\n\n Techniques, solvents and reagents may be referred to by their following abbreviations: \n\n\nThin layer chromatography: TLC liquid chromatography mass spectrometry: \n\n\n LCMS \n\n\n High performance liquid chromatography: \n\n\nHPLC milliliters: mL \n\n\nethyl acetate: AcOEt or EtOAc millimoles: mmol \n\n\nmethanol: MeOH micromoles : μηιοΐ \n\n\nether or diethyl ether: Et\n2\n0 microliters: μΐ \n\n\ntetrahydrofuran: THF grams: g \n\n\nAcetonitrile: MeCN or ACN milligrams: mg \n\n\n1 ,2-dimethoxyethane: DME N-iodosuccinimide: NIS \n\n\nTrifluoroacetic acid: TFA room temperature (ambient, about 25°C): rt Dimethylacetamide: DMA (or RT) \n\n\nDimethylformamide: DMF Retention time: t\nR\n \n\n\nDimethylsulfoxide: DMSO N~bromosuccinimide: NBS \n\n\ntriethylamine: Et\n3\nN or TEA Methyl magnesium bromide: MeMgBr tef-i-Butoxycarbonyl: t-Boc or Boc iron(III) acetylacetonate: Fe(acac)\n3\n 2-(Trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl: Teoc Diphenylphosphoryl azide: DPPA \n\n 1 -(3 -Dimethylaminopropyl)-3 - John-Phos \n\n\nethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride; EDCI \n\n\n 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2'\nJ\n4',6'-\n\n\nDiisopropylethylarnine: DIEA or iPr\n2\nNEt triisopropyl biphenyl: X-Phos \n\n\n Diisopropylamine: iPr\n2\nNH 2-( 1 H-7- Azabenzotriazol- 1 -yl)- 1,1,3,3- tetramethyl uronium hexafluorophosphate:\n\n\n2- (Trimethylsilyl)ethanoI : TMSethanol \n\n\n HATU \n\n\n 3- Chloroperoxybenzoic acid: mCPBA \n\n\n Concentrated: cone. \n\n\nn-Butyllithium: nBuLi \n\n\n Tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride: TBAF lithium diisopropylamide: LDA \n\n\n 2-Dicyclohexylphosphino-2',6\n1\n-\n\n\n[1,1 'Bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]di- diisopropoxy- 1 , 1 '-biphenyl: RuPhos chloropalladium(II): PdCl\n2\ndppf \n\n\n Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium:\n\n\nPalladium(II) acetate: Pd(OAc)\n2\n \n\n\n Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n4\n \n\n\n Methanesulfonyl chloride: MeS0\n2\nCl \n\n\n Benzyl: Bn \n\n\n 4- methoxy benzyl: PMB \n\n\nPhenyl: Ph \n\n\n Ethanol: EtOH \n\n\n Liter: L \n\n\n Minutes: min \n\n\n Reverse phase: RP \n\n\n Hexaaes: Hex \n\n\n Methylene Chloride: DCM \n\n\n Acetic acid: HOAc or AcOH \n\n\n Saturated: Sat (or sat) \n\n\n B is(2 -oxo-3 -oxazolidinyl) phosphinic \n\n\nchloride: BOPC1 \n\n\n 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine: DMAP \n\n\nMolar: M \n\n\n 2-((trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl: SEM \n\n\nDiisopropyl azodicarboxylate: DIAD \n\n\nTriethylborane: Et B \n\n\n Tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0): \n\n\n Pd\n2\ndba\n3\n \n\n\n Pyridine: Pyr \n\n\n (2-Biphenyl)di-teri-butytphosphine: \n\n Scheme la \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: To a solution of 2,4-difloroacetophenone (15,0 g, 96 mmol) in THF (100 mL) was added (R)-2-methyl-2-propanesulfinamide (12.8 g, 106 mmol) and Ti(OEt)\n4\n, (32.0 g, 120 mmol). The resultant solution was heated to reflux overnight. After that time, the solution was cooled to RT and poured onto ice. To this mixture was added CH\n2\nCI\n2\n and the resultant mixture was stirred at RT for 10 min. The mixture was then filtered through Celite. The filter cake was washed with CH\n2\nCI\n2\n. The layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with CH\n2\nCI\n2\n (2x), The combined organic layers were dried over Na\n2\nS0\n4\n, filtered and concentrated. The crude product was purified via flash chromatography (S1O2: gradient elution 100:0 to 45:55 hexanes:EtOAc) to afford the ketimine (12.3 g). \n\n\nStep 2: To a stirred solution of 4-methoxybenzyl amine (198.9 g, 1.45 mol) in anhydrous pyridine (400 mL) at 0°C was added dropwise via an addition funnel methanesulfonyl chloride (1 16 mL, 1.45 mol) over 45 min. After the addition was complete, the cooling bath was removed and the resultant solution was stirred at RT overnight. The reaction was concentrated in vacuo (water bath 60-65°C) to remove most of the pyridine, The residue was taken up in CH\n2\nCI\n2\n (1 L). The organic solution was washed with 1 N HC1 \n(aq\n.} (2 x 1 L), sat. NaHC\n(\n¾ (aq) (2 x 1 L) and brine (1 x 500 mL). The organic layer was dried over Na\n2\nS04, filtered and \n\n concentrated to afford a crude solid. This solid was dissolved in 95% EtOH (430 mL) using a steam bath to warm the solution. The solution was allowed to cool, causing the product to precipitate from solution. The product was removed by filtration and the solid was washed with cold EtOH (3 x 150 mL).

Step 5: To a solution of the product of step 4 (570 mg, 1.37 mmol) in MeOH (25 mL) was added 10% Pd(OH)\n2\n/C (250 mg), and the reaction was stirred in a Parr-shaker under an atmosphere of ¾ (50 psi) for 18 h. The reaction was filtered over a pad of celite, the filter residue rinsed with MeOH and the combined organic layers concentrated under reduced pressure to give a residue (423 mg, 80%). To a solution of this residue (423 mg, 1.08 mmol) in toluene (3 mL) was added KOAc (85 mg\ns\n 0.86 mmol), acetic anhydride (0.205 mL, 2.16 mmol) and ierf-butylnitrite (0.145 mL, 1.2 mmol). The reaction was stirred at 90 °C for 4.5 h, then cooled to RT and diluted with EtOAc. After filtration through celite, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give a residue that was subjected to silica gel chromatography (gradient elution 100:0 to 70:30 hexanes:EtOAc). The resulting mixture of acetylated and deacetylated materials (298 mg) was dissolved in THF (5 mL) and treated with aqueous 1 M LiOH (2 mL) for 30 min at RT.

This assay monitored the increase of 620 nm fluorescence that resulted from BACEl cleavage of an APPswedish APP\nswe\n mutant peptide FRET substrate (QSY7 -EISEVNLD AEFC-Europium-amide) . This substrate contained an N-terniinal QSY7 moiety that served as a quencher of the C-terminal Europium fluorophore (620 nm Em). In the absence of enzyme activity, 620 nm fluorescence was low in the assay and increased linearly over 3 hours in the presence of uninhibited BACEl enzyme. Inhibition of BACEl cleavage of the QSY7-APP\ns e\n-Eu substrate by inhibitors was manifested as a suppression of 620 nm fluorescence. \n\n\n Varying concentrations of inhibitors at 3x the final desired concentration in a volume of lOul were preincubated with purified human BACEl catalytic domain (3 nM in 10 μΐ) for 30 minutes at 30° C in reaction buffer containing 20 mM Na- Acetate pH 5.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Brij-35 and 7.5% DSMO. Reactions were initiated by addition of 10 μΐ of 600 nM QSY7-APP\nswe\n-Eu substrate (200 nM final) to give a final reaction volume of 30 μΐ in a 384 well Nunc HTRF plate. The reactions were incubated at 30° C for 1.5 hours. The 620nm fluorescence was then read on a Rubystar HTRF plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies) using a 50 3 delay followed by a 400 millisecond acquisition time window. Inhibitor IC50 values were derived from non-linear regression analysis of concentration response curves, ¾ values were then calculated from IC\n5\no values using the Cheng-Prusoff equation using a previously determined μπι value of 8μΜ for the QSY7-APP\nswc\n-Eu substrate at BACEl. \n\n\n All of the example compounds of the invention were tested (except for Examples 8, 9,\n\n\n10, 14b, 14c, 14d, 14e, and 14f) in this BACE-1 assay and exhibited K; values of less than about 7.5 μΜ and greater than about 0.5 nM in this assay. All of the example compounds except for examples 19, 40x, 98, 101, and 189 exhibited ¾ values of less than about 5 μΜ in this assay. Some of the example compounds exhibited ¾ values of less than about 4 μΜ in this assay; others less than about 3 μΜ in this assay; others less than about 2 μΜ in this assay; \n\n others less than about 1 μΜ in this assay; others less than about 500 nM in this assay; others less than about 300 nM in this assay; others less than about 200 nM in this assay; others less than about 100 nM in this assay; others less than about 50 nM in this assay; others less than about 10 nM in this assay; others less than about 5 nM in this assay. The compound of Example 45 exhibited a Ki value of about 26 nM in this assay. The compound of Example 47 exhibited a Ki value of about 6.5 nM in this assay. \n\n\nBACE-2 Assay \n\n\n Inhibitor IC\n5\no\ns\n at purified human autoBACE-2 were determined in a time-resolved endpoint proteolysis assay that measures hydrolysis of the QSY7-EISEVNLDAEFC-Eu-amide FRET peptide substrate (BACE-HTRF assay). BACE-mediated hydrolysis of this peptide results in an increase in relative fluorescence (RFU) at 620 nm after excitation with 320 nm light. Inhibitor compounds, prepared at 3x the desired final concentration in l BACE assay buffer (20 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Brij-35) supplemented with 7.5% DM SO were pre-incubated with an equal volume of autoBACE-2 enzyme diluted in lx BACE assay buffer (final enzyme concentration 1 nM) in black 384-well NUNC plates for 30 minutes at 30°C. The assay was initiated by addition of an equal volume of the QSY7- EISEVNLDAEFC-Eu-amide substrate (200 nM final concentration, K\nm\n=8 μΜ for 4 μΜ for autoBACE-2) prepared in lx BACE assay buffer supplemented with 7.5% DMSO and incubated for 90 minutes at 30°C. DMSO was present at 5% final concentration in the assay. Following laser excitation of sample wells at 320 nm, the fluorescence signal at 620 nm was collected for 400 ms following a 50 delay on a RUBYstar HTRF plate reader (BMG Labtechnologies). Raw RFU data was normalized to maximum (1.0 nM BACE/DMSO) and minimum (no enzyme/DMSO) RFU values. ICsos were determined by nonlinear regression analysis (sigmoidal dose response, variable slope) of percent inhibition data with minimum and maximum values set to 0 and 100 percent respectively. Similar ¼ο\n¾\n were obtained when using raw RFU data. The Kj values were calculated from the IC5\n0\n using the Cheng-Prusoff equation. \n\n\n All of the example compounds of the invention were tested in this BACE-2 assay except for the following examples: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 14b, 14c, 14d, 14e, 14f, 15, 16, 17, 19, 40a, 40b, 40ea, 40h, 40o, 40p, 40q, 40u, 40w, 40x, 40y, 40aa, 40au, 40cc, 40co, 40cp, 40cy, 40dj, 40gy, 40gz, 40ha, 40hb, 40hc, 40ih, 41, 43, 45, 49, 60, 61, 67, 68, 69, \n\n 70, 71, 73, 74, 75, 77, 85, 86, 88, 89, 90, 91, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 105, 108, 109, 109, 1 15, 1 16, 117, 122, 123, 125, 130b, 137, 138, 143, 145, 161b, 176, 179, 182, 189, 192, 194, 195, 199, Of the example compounds of the invention that were tested in this BACE-2 assay, all exhibited K, values of less than about 900 nM and greater than about 0.04 nM in this assay. All of the example compounds that were tested in this assay, except for examples 40ex, 40do, 160, 161a, 164, and 197 exhibited ¾ values of less than about 500 nM in this assay. Some of the example compounds exhibited Kj values of less than about 200 nM in this assay; others less than about 100 nM in this assay; others less than about 50 nM in this assay; others less than about 25 nM in this assay; others less than about 10 nM in this assay; others less than about 5 nM in this assay; others less than about 1 nM in this assay; others less than about 0.5 nM in this assay. The compound of Example 47 exhibited a Ki value of about 1 nM in this assay. \n\n\n The novel iminothiadiazine dioxide compounds of the invention have surprisingly been found to exhibit properties which are expected to render them advantageous as BACE inhibitors and/or for the various methods of used herein. \n\n\nCortical Αβ,». \n\n\n The iminothiadiazine dioxide compounds of the invention have been found, surprisingly and advantageously, to exhibit improved efficacy in lowering Αβ\n4\nο production in the cerebral cortex than their iminopyrimidone analogs. The following procedures were used, Results are shown in the table below. \n\n\nRat Tissue Collection \n\n\n Male CD rats (-100 g; Crl:CD(SD); Charles River Laboratories, Kingston, NY) were group housed and acclimated to the vivarium for 5-7 days prior to use in a study. Compounds were formulated in 20% hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin and administered orally with a dosing volume of 5 ml/kg for rats. Three h after drug administration, rats were euthanized with excess C0\n2\n. The brain was removed from the skull and immediately frozen on dry ice. All tissues were stored at -70°C until Α quantification. \n\n\nDetermination of Ap o Levels in Rat Cortex by ELISA \n\n\n The measurement of endogenous rat Αβ1-40 (Αβ40) in cortex relied on the 585 antibody (Ab585, BioSource), catalogue no. NON0585), which specifically recognizes the N- \n\n terniinal sequence of rodent Αβ40, and the monoclonal antibody, G2-10, which specifically recognizes the free C-terminus of Αβ40. Ab585 was labeled with biotin (b-Ab585) by first dialyzing the antibody sample extensively versus PBS (pH 7.8) to remove impurities, followed by dilution to between 1 and 2 mg/mL protein concentration. EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) was dissolved in PBS (pH 7.8) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL immediately prior to use. Ab585 was labeled with EZ-Link SuIfo-NHS-LC-biotin using a 10:1 biotin.-antibody ratio by incubation at room temperature for 1 hour. The labeling reaction was quenched by addition of 1.0 M glycine to a final concentration of 0.1 M followed by 10 minute incubation at room temperature. Glycine was removed by extensive dialysis versus PBS. \n\n\n The use of the Luminex based immunoassay for measurement of rat cortical Αβ40 required that the G2-10 antibody be labeled with Bio-Plex COOH Bead 25 (Bio-Rad laboratories catalogue no. 171506025). The antibody was coupled to the beads using the Bio- Plex Amine Coupling Kit (Bio-Rad) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. \n\n\n Rat cortex Αβ40 levels were measured from guanidine HC1 extracts of individual rat cortices using a Luminex-based immunodetection assay. Rat brains were thawed briefly at 37° C and both mid- and hindbrain regions were removed. The remaining material, consisting primarily of cortex (-800 mg) was carried through the guanidine extraction procedure. \n\n\nCortices were added to a 2 ml BioPur tube (Eppendorf) along with a 6.35 mm chrome-coated steel ball and 1.0 ml of sucrose homogenization buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 50 mM KCl, 50 mM sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA supplemented with complete protease inhibitors [Roche, EDTA-free]). Samples were then homogenized by agitation for 1.5 min at 30 cylces/sec in a MM300 tissue mixer (Retsch\n®\n). The resulting cortical homogenate was extracted with guanidine-HCl by mixing 67 ul of homogenate with 133 μϊ of 5 M Guanidine HC1, 50 mM Tris HC1 (pH 8.0). To maximize the efficiency of Αβ extraction, samples were vortexed and then sonicated for 2 minutes in an ice bath using an Ultrasonics XL cup horn sonicator at a power setting of 8 (Heat Systems, Inc.). Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation using a using a TLA-55 rotor in a TL-100 benchtop centrifuge (Beckman) at 100,000xg for 30 minutes. The resulting supernatant was then either diluted 1 :10 in 5 M guanidine HC1, 0.05 M Tris HC1 (pH 8.0) for protein analysis (BCA protein assay, Pierce Biochemicals) or assayed neat for Αβ40 levels. The Luminex rodent Αβ40 assay was \n\n performed as follows. First, 96 well filter binding plates (Miliipore, catalogue # MSBVN12) were wetted with 100 μΐ of lx ΙΑβ40 buffer (0.05 M HEPES [pH 7.5], 0.2% BSA, 0.2% Tween-20, 0,15 M NaCl) by vacuum filtration on a Miliipore 96-well manifold. The plate bottom was sealed and 100 μΐ of l LAp40 buffer was added to each well followed by addition of 50 μΐ each of G2-10:COOH beads (1000 beads/well) and 50 μ! b-Ab585 at 0.5 g/ml in 1 x ΙΑβ40 buffer. Guanidine HCl was added to synthetic rodent Αβ40 standards in order to control for the effect of guanidine in brain extracts on the assay performance. Ten microliters of cortical extract, rodent Αβ40 standards or cortical extract from amyloid precursor protein knockout mice (to define background immunoreactivity) was added to each well. Plates were covered and incubated overnight at 4°C. Following the incubation, wells were cleared by vacuum and washed twice with 100 μΐ of lx ίΑβ40 buffer on a Miliipore manifold. Phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (PE-strepavidin, BioRad) for detection of bound b-Ab585 was diluted 100-fold in lx ΙΑβ40 buffer and 50 μΐ was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with shaking. Unbound PE-streptavidin was removed by three 100 μΐ washes with cytokine assay buffer (BioRad). Washed beads were resuspended in 125 μΐ of cytokine assay buffer by shaking on a microplate shaker. Plates were read on a BioPlex suspension array system (BioRad) with target region beads set to 40 beads/region and the upper end of the DD gate set to 10,000. Raw fluorescence data was analyzed using nonlinear regression analysis and absolute Αβ40 levels were extrapolated from the standard curve using GraphPad Prism 4.0.2. Absolute amounts of Α ι^ο are expressed as picograms per micrograms protein. Percent change values for each compound were calculated by normalization of the average absolute cortical Αβ1-40 level in each compound treated cohort to the average absolute cortical Αβ1-40 levels in the vehicle cohort. Comparative results are shown in the table below. \"NT\" means not tested. \n\n\n Change in Cortical Αβ4β in Rats 3 h After a 10 mg/kg Oral Dose of Compound\n\n\nIminothiadiazine Dioxide Iminopyrimidinone \n\n\n BACE-l Change Change\n\n\nEx.

P-gp is found, among other locations, at the blood-brain barrier, and reduced susceptibility to efflux by this protein is a desirable characteristic of centrally acting compounds (A. Schinkel Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 1999, 36, 179-194). The following procedures were used. Results are shown in the table below. \n\n\n Caco-2 Bi-directional Permeability \n\n\n The bi-directional permeability with efflux potential of selected compounds of the invention vs. otherwise structurally identical iminopyrimidinones (collectively referred to as test compounds, shown in the table below) were assessed using Caco-2 cell line. The Caco-2 cells were maintained in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1% \n\n\n penicillin-streptomycin in an incubator at ~37°C in an atmosphere of 5% C(¾ and about 90% \n\n relative humidity. The cell culture medium was changed three times weekly. Caco-2 cell monolayers were grown on polyethylene terephthalate filters using 24-well BD Falcon™ Cell Culture Insert Plates (0.33 cm\n2\n insert area, 1 μπι pore size; BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). The culture medium of the plate was changed every other day until used for the transport experiment (21-28 days post seeding). \n\n\n The transport buffer (TM) was Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) with 10 mM HEPES and 25 mM glucose (pH 7.4) for dosing and TM with 4% bovine serum albumin for receiver (pH 7.4). The bi-directional permeability of the test compounds were tested at concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 μΜ was measured in triplicate with 2-hr incubation. The cell monolayer integrity was monitored with pre- and post-experimental trans-epithelial electrical resistance and post-experimental Lucifer Yellow (LY) permeability with 1 hr incubation. Test article samples were analyzed using LC-MS MS and the concentration of LY was measured using a Perkin Elmer HTS 7000 Plus Bio Assay Reader (Waltham, MA) with an excitation and emission wavelength of 485 nm and 538 nm, respectively. \n\n\n The apparent permeability, recovery and efflux ratio values were calculated using the following equations: \n\n\n\n\n\n Papp _SLtoAP \n\n\n Efflux Ratio \n\n\n Papp __ APtoBL \n\n\n CD, final Receiver Accumulated Amount \n\n\n Total Recovery (%) = x 100 + x 100 \n\n\n Co CO * VD \n\n\nThe slope of the accumulative concentration in the receiver compartment versus time incubation (uM\n*\ns ) \n\n\n Co\nhr\n: Donor concentration (μΜ) immediately after dosing \n\n\n CD, finai: Donor concentration (uM) at the end of incubation \n\n\n S: Membrane surface area (cm\n2\n) \n\n\n V\nD\n: Volume of donor compartment (mL) \n\n\n V\nR\n: Volume of receiver compartment (mL) \n\n\n P» _BLioAp: Permeability from basolateral (BL) to apical (AP) transport \n\n Pap\nP\n_APioBL: Permeability from AP to BL transport \n\n\n Evaluation of P-gp efflux inhibition using Caco-2 bi-directional permeability assay \n\n\n A preliminary study to assess the compounds in the table below as potential P-gp substrates were performed using the Caco-2 bi-directional transport assay. Digoxin was used as a probe P-gp substrate. The ¾-digoxin dosing solution was prepared by diluting a digoxin DMSO stock with TM and/or the inhibitor solutions and titrating with \n3\nH-digoxin (final digoxin concentration was 5 μΜ with 0.5 μα/mL radioactivity). Two concentrations of test compounds (5 and 50 μΜ) were prepared by diluting a DMSO stock solution with TM (pH 7.4). The Caco-2 bi-directional permeability of \n3\nH-digoxin with or without test compound as inhibitor was measured as described in the Caco-2 bi-directional permeability section. The total radioactivity for each sample was counted using a Packard 2250CA Tri-Carb Liquid Scintillation Analyzer. \n\n\n The percentage of digoxin efflux inhibition was calculated using the following equation: \n\n\n pinhibitor riinhibitor \n\n\n rapp _BLtoAP app_APtoBL \n\n\n %_1nhibition = (1 ) * 100 \n\n\n Papp _ BLtoAP— Papp _ APtoBL \n\n\n where, \n\n\n Digoxin permeability from BL to AP transport \n\n\n Papp_APtoBL- Digoxin permeability from AP to BL transport \n\n\nDigoxin permeability with inhibitor from BL to AP transport Digoxin permeability with inhibitor from AP to BL transport \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution Stability \n\n\n The iminothiadiazine dioxide compounds of the invention have been found, surprisingly and advantageously, to exhibit improved solution stability (e.g., by resistence to hydrolysis) compared with structurally similar iminopyrimidinones. The following comparative procedures were used. Results are reported as Examples A and B below. \n\n\n A 1.05 mg/mL stock solution (5 mL) of Ex. 45 in MeOH was prepared. From the stock solution was taken out 1.25 mL and diluted to 25 mL with the addition of 23.75 mL of 10 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)/MeOH (70/30 v/v), This new solution was split into three.

Description\n\n\n\n\n FUSED HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS AS OREXIN RECEPTOR \n\n\n MODULATORS \n\n\nCross Reference to Related Application \n\n\n This application claims the benefit of US provisional patent application serial number 61/254,517, filed October 23, 2009. \n\n\nField of the Invention \n\n\n The present invention relates to certain disubstituted 3,8-diaza- bicyclo[4.2.0]octane and 3,6-diazabicyclo [3.2.0]heptane compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, methods of making them, and methods of using them for the modulation of the orexin receptor and for the treatment of disease states, disorders, and conditions mediated by orexin receptor activity. \n\n\n Background of the Invention \n\n\n Orexin (or hypocretin) signaling is mediated by two receptors and two peptide agonists. The two orexin peptides (orexin A and orexin B) herein after referred to as orexins, bind to two high affinity receptors, termed orexin-1 and orexin-2 receptors. The orexin-1 receptor is selective in favor of orexin A, while the orexin-2 receptor binds both orexins with similar affinities. The orexins, are cleavage products of the same gene, prepro orexin. In the central nervous system neurons expressing prepro-orexin, the precursor from which orexin is produced, are found in the perifornical nucleus, the dorsal hypothalamus and the lateral hypothalamus (C. Peyron et al., J. Neurosci., 1998, 18(23), 9996- 10015). Orexinergic cells in these nuclei project to many areas of the brain, extending rostrally to the olfactory bulbs and caudally to the spinal cord (van den Pol, A.N. et al., J. Neuroscience., 1999, 19(8), 3171 -3182). \n\n\n The broad CNS distribution of orexin projections and neurons \n\n\nexpressing orexin receptors is suggestive of orexin involvement in a number of physiological functions including; feeding, drinking, arousal, stress, reward, metabolism and reproduction (T. Sakurai, Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 2007, 8(3), 171 -181 ). \n\n The targeted necrosis of cells expressing prepro-orexin suggests the most physiologically important roles of the orexins are likely to be effects on arousal, feeding and metabolism (J. Hara et al., Neuron, 2001 , 30, 345-354). A prominent orexin neuronal projection via the vagus nerve probably mediates central orexin effects on cardiac parameters (W.K. Samson et al., Brain Res., 1999, 831 , 248-253; T. Shirasaka et al., Am. J. Physiol., 1999, 277, R1780- R1785; C.-T. Chen et al., Am. J. Physiol., 2000, 278, R692-R697), gastric acid secretion and gastric motility (A.L. Kirchgessner and M.-T. Liu, Neuron, 1999, 24, 941 -951 ; N. Takahashi et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1999, 254, 623-627). \n\n\n Several lines of evidence indicate that the orexin system is an important modulator of arousal. Rodents administered orexins intracerebroventricularly spend more time awake (Piper et al., J. Neurosci. 2000, 12, 726-730). Orexin- mediated effects on arousal have been linked to orexin neuronal projections to histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) (Yamanaka et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2002, 290, 1237-1245). TMN neurons express the orexin-2 receptor primarily, and the orexin-1 receptor to a lesser extent. Rodents whose prepro orexin gene has been knocked out, or whose orexigenic neurons have been lesioned, display altered sleep/wake cycles similar to narcolepsy (Chemelli et al., Cell 1999, 98, 437-451 ; Hara et al., 2001 , supra). Dog models of narcolepsy have been shown to have mutant or nonfunctional orexin-2 receptors (Lin et al., Cell 1999, 98, 365-376). Human narcolepsy appears to be linked to deficient orexin signaling, likely related to immune ablation of orexinergic neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (Mignot et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001 , 68: 686-699; Minot & Thorsby, New England J. Med. 2001 , 344, 692), or, in rare cases, to mutations in the orexin-2 gene (Peyron et al., Nature Med. 2000, 6, 991 -997). The disclosure that rats, dogs and humans treated with the dual orexin-1/2 receptor antagonist, ACT-078573 (Brisbare-Roch et al., Nature Medicine, 2007, 13, 150-155) exhibited \n\n\ndecreased alertness together with characteristic clinical and EEG \n\n\n (electroencephalographic) signs of sleep provides evidence to support a role for the orexin system in the regulation of arousal, sleep and wake states. EEG data indicates that orexin-2 may be more important than orexin-1 in the \n\n modulation of sleep/wake (P. Malherbe et al., Molecular Pharmacology (2009) 76(3):618-31 ; C. Dugovic et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Then, 2009, 330(1 ), 142- 151 ). Disorders of the sleep-wake cycle are therefore likely targets for orexin-2 receptor antagonist therapy. Examples of such disorders include sleep-wake transition disorders, insomnia, restless legs syndrome, jet-lag, disturbed sleep, and sleep disorders secondary to neurological disorders (e.g., manias, depressions, manic depression, schizophrenia, and pain syndromes (e.g., fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain). \n\n\n The orexin system also interacts with brain dopamine systems. \n\n\nIntracerebroventricular injections of orexins in mice increase locomotor activity, grooming and stereotypy; these behavioral effects are reversed by \n\n\nadministration of D\n2\n dopamine receptor antagonists (Nakamura et al., Brain Research, 873(1 ), 181 -7). Therefore, orexin-2 modulators may be useful to treat various neurological disorders; e.g., agonists or up-regulators to treat catatonia, antagonists or down-regulators to treat Parkinson's disease, \n\n\nTourette's syndrome, anxiety, delerium and dementias. \n\n\n Recent evidence indicates a role for orexin in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (Kang et al, Science Express, 2009, 1 -10). Brain interstitial fluid levels of amyloid-beta were demonstrated to fluctuate diurnally in both humans and rodents with sleep deprivation in rodents leading to significant increases in brain interstitial fluid levels of amyloid-beta. Infusion of a dual orexin antagonist in rodents suppressed interstitial levels of amyloid-beta and abolished the natural diurnal variation of amyloid-beta. The reduction of interstitial fluid amyloid-beta levels is correlated with reduced amyloid plaque formation, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, and consequently the regulation of sleep time could potentially inhibit amyloid-beta aggregation and slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. \n\n\n Orexin neurons project to many regions of the brain associated with reward function (T. Sakurai, supra) and research, focusing on animal models of drug intake, reward, and reinstatement, has expanded the link between the orexin system and addiction. A comprehensive set of data suggest that drugs of abuse activate the orexin system, which in turn enhances drug reward or drug seeking (G. Aston-Jones et al., Neuropharmacology, 2009, 56 (Suppl 1 ) \n\n 1 12-121 . Thus interactions between nicotine (J. K. Kane et al., Endocrinology, 2000, 141 (10), 3623-3629; J. K. Kane et al., Neurosci. Lett, 2001 , 298(1 ), 1 -4), morphine (D. Georgescu, et al., J. Neurosci., 2003, 23(8), 3106-31 1 1 ) and amphetamine (C. J. Winrow et al., Neuropharmacology, 2010, 58(1 ), 185-94) and the orexin system have been demonstrated. Additional studies from a number of laboratories have demonstrated an important relationship between the Orexin system and ethanol consumption. As examples, ethanol \n\n\nconsumption in an alcohol-preferring strain of rat was shown to up regulate Orexin mRNA in the lateral hypothalamus and that an Orexin-1 receptor antagonist reduced operant responding for ethanol (Lawrence, et. al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 2006, 148, 752-759). Treatment with an orexin-1 antagonist has also been shown to decrease operant responding for ethanol (Richards, et. al., Psychopharmacology, 2008, 199 (1 ), 109-1 17). Other studies have \n\n\ndemonstrated increased Fos activation of orexin neurons following contextual reinstatement to ethanol seeking (Dayas, et. al., Biol. Psychiatry, 2008, 63 (2), 152-157 and Hamlin, et. al., Neuroscience, 2007, 146, 525-536). Studies have also shown increased ethanol consumption following Orexin infusion into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus or in the lateral hypothalamus (Schneider, et. al., Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res., 2007, 37(1 1 ), 1858-1865). These studies provide evidence that modulation of the Orexin system effects alcohol preference and therefore Orexin receptor antagonists are likely to be useful for the treatment of alcoholism. \n\n\n Orexins and their receptors have been found in both the myenteric and submucosal plexus of the enteric nervous system, where orexins have been shown to increase motility in vitro (Kirchgessner & Liu, Neuron 1999, 24, 941 - 951 ) and to stimulate gastric acid secretion in vitro (Takahashi et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1999, 254, 623-627). Orexin mediated effects on the gut may be driven by a projection via the vagus nerve (van den Pol, 1999, supra), as vagotomy or atropine prevent the effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of orexin on gastric acid secretion (Takahashi et al., 1999, supra). Orexin receptor antagonists or other down-regulators of orexin receptor- mediated systems are therefore potential treatments for ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, diarrhea and gastroesophageal reflux. \n\n Body weight may also be affected by orexin-mediated regulation of appetite and metabolism (T. Sakurai et al., Cell, 1998, 92(4), 573-585; T. \n\n\n Sakurai, Reg. Pept, 1999, 85(1 ), 25-30). Some effects of orexin on \n\n\nmetabolism and appetite may be mediated in the gut, where, as mentioned, orexins alter gastric motility and gastric acid secretion. Orexin receptor antagonists therefore are likely to be useful in treatment of overweight or obesity and conditions related to overweight or obesity, such as insulin resistance, type II diabetes, hyperlipidemia, gallstones, angina, hypertension, breathlessness, tachycardia, infertility, sleep apnea, back and joint pain, varicose veins and osteoarthritis. Conversely, orexin receptor agonists are likely to be useful in treatment of underweight and related conditions such as hypotension, bradycardia, ammenorrhea and related infertility, and eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia. \n\n\n Intracerebroventricularly administered orexins have been shown to increase mean arterial pressure and heart rate in freely moving (awake) animals (Samson et al., Brain Res. 1999, 831 , 248-253; Shirasaka et al., Am.

Physiol. 2000, 278, R692-R697), with similar results. \n\n\n Orexin receptor agonists may therefore be candidates for treatment of hypotension, bradycardia and heart failure related thereto, while orexin receptor antagonists may be useful for treatment of hypertension, tachycardia and other arrhythmias, angina pectoris and acute heart failure. \n\n\n From the foregoing discussion, it can be seen that the identification of orexin receptor modulators, in one embodiment modulators of the orexin-2 receptor, will be of great advantage in the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of a wide variety of disorders that are mediated through these receptor systems. \n\n\n Citation of a reference herein shall not be construed as an admission that such reference is prior art to the present invention.

For example, an \n18\nF or \n11\nC labeled compound may be particularly preferred for PET or an I\n123\n for SPECT studies. \n\n\n An object of the present invention is to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the conventional methodologies and/or prior art, or to provide a useful alternative thereto. Additional embodiments, features, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description and through practice of the invention. \n\n\n DETAILED DESCRIPTION \n\n\n The invention may be more fully appreciated by reference to the following description, including the following glossary of terms and the concluding examples. For the sake of brevity, the disclosures of the \n\n publications, including patents, cited in this specification are herein \n\n\nincorporated by reference. \n\n\n As used herein, the terms \"including\", \"containing\" and \"comprising\" are used herein in their open, non-limiting sense. \n\n\n The term \"alkyl\" refers to a straight- or branched-chain alkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the chain. Examples of alkyl groups include methyl (Me, which also may be structurally depicted by the symbol, 7\"), ethyl (Et), n-propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl (tBu), pentyl, isopentyl, tert-pentyl, hexyl, isohexyl, and groups that in light of the ordinary skill in the art and the teachings provided herein would be considered \n\n\nequivalent to any one of the foregoing examples. \n\n\n The term \"alkoxy\" includes a straight chain or branched alkyl group with a terminal oxygen linking the alkyl group to the rest of the molecule. Alkoxy includes methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, t-butoxy, pentoxy and so on. \"Aminoalkyl\", \"thioalkyl\", and \"sulfonylalkyl\" are analogous to alkoxy, replacing the terminal oxygen atom of alkoxy with, respectively, NH (or NR), S, and SO\n2\n. \n\n\n The term \"cyano\" refers to the group -CN. \n\n\n The term \"cycloalkyl\" refers to a saturated or partially saturated, monocyclic, fused polycyclic, or spiro polycyclic carbocycle having from 3 to 12 ring atoms per carbocycle. Illustrative examples of cycloalkyl groups include the foll wing entities, in the form of properly bonded moieties: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n A \"heterocycloalkyl\" refers to a monocyclic ring structure that is saturated or partially saturated and has from 4 to 7 ring atoms per ring structure selected from carbon atoms and up to two heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur. The ring structure may optionally contain up to two oxo \n\n groups on sulfur ring members. Illustrative entities, in the form of properly bonded moieties, include: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The term \"aryl\" refers to a monocyclic, or fused or spiro polycyclic, aromatic carbocycle (ring structure having ring atoms that are all carbon) having from 3 to 12 ring atoms per ring. (Carbon atoms in aryl groups are sp\n2\n hybridized.) Illustrative examples of aryl groups include the following moieties: \n\n\n\n\n\n The term \"heteroaryl\" refers to a monocyclic, fused bicyclic, or fused polycyclic aromatic heterocycle (ring structure having ring atoms selected from carbon atoms and up to four heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur) having from 3 to 12 ring atoms per heterocycle. Illustrative examples of heteroaryl groups include the following entities, in the form of properly bonded moieties: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Those skilled in the art will recognize that the species of heteroaryl, \n\n cycloalkyl, aryl and heterocycloalkyl groups listed or illustrated above are not exhaustive, and that additional species within the scope of these defined terms may also be selected. \n\n\n The term \"halogen\" represents chlorine, fluorine, bromine or iodine. The term \"halo\" represents chloro, fluoro, bromo or iodo. \n\n\n The term \"substituted\" means that the specified group or moiety bears one or more substituents. The term \"unsubstituted\" means that the specified group bears no substituents. The term \"optionally substituted\" means that the specified group is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituents. Where the term \"substituted\" is used to describe a structural system, the substitution is meant to occur at any valency-allowed position on the system. In cases where a specified moiety or group is not expressly noted as being optionally substituted or substituted with any specified substituent, it is understood that such a moiety or group is intended to be unsubstituted. \n\n\n The terms \"para\", \"meta\", and \"ortho\" have the meanings as understood in the art. Thus, for example, a fully substituted phenyl group has substituents at both \"ortho\"(o) positions adjacent to the point of attachment of the phenyl ring, both \"meta\" (m) positions, and the one \"para\" (p) position across from the point of attachment as illustrated below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n To provide a more concise description, some of the quantitative expressions given herein are not qualified with the term \"about\". It is understood that, whether the term \"about\" is used explicitly or not, every quantity given herein is meant to refer to the actual given value, and it is also meant to refer to the approximation to such given value that would reasonably be inferred based on the ordinary skill in the art, including equivalents and approximations due to the experimental and/or measurement conditions for such given value. Whenever a yield is given as a percentage, such yield refers to a mass of the entity for which the yield is given with respect to the maximum amount of the same entity that could be obtained under the particular \n\n stoichiometric conditions. Concentrations that are given as percentages refer to mass ratios, unless indicated differently. \n\n\n The terms \"buffered\" solution or \"buffer\" solution are used herein interchangeably according to their standard meaning. Buffered solutions are used to control the pH of a medium, and their choice, use, and function is known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See, for example, G.D. Considine, ed., Van Nostrand's Encyclopedia of Chemistry, p. 261 , 5\nth\n ed. (2005), describing, inter alia, buffer solutions and how the concentrations of the buffer constituents relate to the pH of the buffer. See also Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 84\nth\n ed., pp. 8-37 to 8-44. For example, a buffered solution is obtained by adding MgSO and NaHCO\n3\n to a solution in a 10:1 w/w ratio to maintain the pH of the solution at about 7.5. \n\n\n Any formula given herein is intended to represent compounds having structures depicted by the structural formula as well as certain variations or forms. In particular, compounds of any formula given herein may have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms. All optical isomers and stereoisomers of the compounds of the general formula, and mixtures thereof, are considered within the scope of the formula. Thus, any formula given herein is intended to represent a racemate, one or more enantiomeric forms, one or more diastereomeric forms, one or more \n\n\natropisomeric forms, and mixtures thereof. Furthermore, certain structures may exist as geometric isomers (i.e., cis and trans isomers), as tautomers, or as atropisomers. \n\n\n The symbols and \"\"^- are used as meaning the same spatial arrangement in chemical structures shown herein. Analogously, the symbols and \" are used as meaning the same spatial arrangement in chemical structures shown herein. \n\n\n Additionally, any formula given herein is intended to refer also to hydrates, solvates, and polymorphs of such compounds, and mixtures thereof, even if such forms are not listed explicitly. Certain compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II) may be obtained as solvates. Solvates include those formed from the interaction or complexation of compounds of the invention with one or \n\n more solvents, either in solution or as a solid or crystalline form. In some embodiments, the solvent is water and then the solvates are hydrates. In addition, certain crystalline forms of compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II) may be obtained as co-crystals. In certain embodiments of the invention, compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II) were obtained in a crystalline form. In other embodiments, crystalline forms of compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II) were cubic in nature. In other embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II) were obtained in a crystalline form. In still other embodiments, compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II) were obtained in one of several polymorphic forms, as a mixture of crystalline forms, as a polymorphic form, or as an amorphous form. In other \n\n\nembodiments, compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II) convert in solution between one or more crystalline forms and/or polymorphic forms. \n\n\n Reference to a chemical entity herein stands for a reference to any one of: (a) the actually recited form of such chemical entity, and (b) any of the forms of such chemical entity in the medium in which the compound is being considered when named. For example, reference herein to a compound such as R-COOH, encompasses reference to any one of, for example, R-COOH\n(S\n), R-COOH\n(SO\ni), and R-COO\n\"\n \n(SO\ni). In this example, R-COOH\n(s)\n refers to the solid compound, as it could be for example in a tablet or some other solid \n\n\npharmaceutical composition or preparation; R-COOH(\nSO\ni) refers to the \n\n\nundissociated form of the compound in a solvent; and R-COO\n\"\n(\nSO\ni) refers to the dissociated form of the compound in a solvent, such as the dissociated form of the compound in an aqueous environment, whether such dissociated form derives from R-COOH, from a salt thereof, or from any other entity that yields R-COO\n\"\n upon dissociation in the medium being considered. In another example, an expression such as \"exposing an entity to compound of formula R- COOH\" refers to the exposure of such entity to the form, or forms, of the compound R-COOH that exists, or exist, in the medium in which such exposure takes place. In still another example, an expression such as \"reacting an entity with a compound of formula R-COOH\" refers to the reacting of (a) such entity in the chemically relevant form, or forms, of such entity that exists, or exist, in the \n\n medium in which such reacting takes place, with (b) the chemically relevant form, or forms, of the compound R-COOH that exists, or exist, in the medium in which such reacting takes place. In this regard, if such entity is for example in an aqueous environment, it is understood that the compound R-COOH is in such same medium, and therefore the entity is being exposed to species such as R-COOH(aq) and/or R-COO\n\"\n(\naq\n), where the subscript \"(aq)\" stands for \n\n\n\"aqueous\" according to its conventional meaning in chemistry and \n\n\nbiochemistry. A carboxylic acid functional group has been chosen in these nomenclature examples; this choice is not intended, however, as a limitation but it is merely an illustration. It is understood that analogous examples can be provided in terms of other functional groups, including but not limited to hydroxyl, basic nitrogen members, such as those in amines, and any other group that interacts or transforms according to known manners in the medium that contains the compound. Such interactions and transformations include, but are not limited to, dissociation, association, tautomerism, solvolysis, including hydrolysis, solvation, including hydration, protonation, and \n\n\ndeprotonation. No further examples in this regard are provided herein because these interactions and transformations in a given medium are known by any one of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n\n In another example, a zwitterionic compound is encompassed herein by referring to a compound that is known to form a zwitterion, even if it is not explicitly named in its zwitterionic form. Terms such as zwitterion, zwitterions, and their synonyms zwitterionic compound(s) are standard lUPAC-endorsed names that are well known and part of standard sets of defined scientific names. In this regard, the name zwitterion is assigned the name identification CHEBI:27369 by the Chemical Entities of Biological Inerest (ChEBI) dictionary of molecular entities. As generally well known, a zwitterion or zwitterionic compound is a neutral compound that has formal unit charges of opposite sign. Sometimes these compounds are referred to by the term \"inner salts\". Other sources refer to these compounds as \"dipolar ions\", although the latter term is regarded by still other sources as a misnomer. As a specific example, aminoethanoic acid (the amino acid glycine) has the formula H\n2\nNCH\n2\nCOOH, and it exists in some media (in this case in neutral media) in the form of the \n\n zwitterion \n+\nH\n3\nNCH\n2\nCOO\n\"\n. Zwitterions, zwitterionic compounds, inner salts and dipolar ions in the known and well established meanings of these terms are within the scope of this invention, as would in any case be so appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. Because there is no need to name each and every embodiment that would be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, no structures of the zwitterionic compounds that are associated with the compounds of this invention are given explicitly herein. They are, however, part of the embodiments of this invention. No further examples in this regard are provided herein because the interactions and transformations in a given medium that lead to the various forms of a given compound are known by any one of ordinary skill in the art. \n\n\n Any formula given herein is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine, and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n11\nC, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, si p 32\nP j\n 35\nSj\n i8\nFj\n 36^ 125^ \nreS\np\nect\nj\nV\nely. Such isotopically labeled compounds are useful in metabolic studies (preferably with \n14\nC), reaction kinetic studies (with, for example \n2\nH or \n3\nH), detection or imaging techniques [such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)] including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in \n\n\nradioactive treatment of patients. In particular, an \n18\nF or \n11\nC labeled compound may be particularly preferred for PET or an I\n123\n for SPECT studies. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. \n\n\nIsotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. \n\n When referring to any formula given herein, the selection of a particular moiety from a list of possible species for a specified variable is not intended to define the same choice of the species for the variable appearing elsewhere. In other words, where a variable appears more than once, the choice of the species from a specified list is independent of the choice of the species for the same variable elsewhere in the formula, unless stated otherwise. \n\n\n By way of a first example on substituent terminology, if substituent S\n1\nexampie is one of Si and S2, and substituent S\n2\n \nex\nampie is one of S3 and S\n4\n, then these assignments refer to embodiments of this invention given according to \n\n\n 1 2 ■ 1 2 the Choices S example IS Si and S example IS S3; S example IS Si and S example IS S\n4\n; \n\n\n 1 2 ■ 1 2 \n\n\n S example IS S2 and S example IS S3; S example IS S2 and S example IS S\n4\n; and \n\n\nequivalents of each one of such choices. The shorter terminology \"S\n1\n \nex\nampie is one of Si and S2, and S\n2\n \nexa\nmpie is one of S3 and S\n4\n\" is accordingly used herein for the sake of brevity, but not by way of limitation. The foregoing first example on substituent terminology, which is stated in generic terms, is meant to illustrate the various substituent assignments described herein. The foregoing convention given herein for substituents extends, when applicable, to members such as R\n1\n , R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, A, R\na\n, R\nb\n, R\nc\n, R\nd\n, R\ne\n, R\nf\n, R\ng\n, R\nh\n, R', R\nj\n, and R\nk\n, and any other generic substituent symbol used herein. \n\n\n Furthermore, when more than one assignment is given for any member or substituent, embodiments of this invention comprise the various groupings that can be made from the listed assignments, taken independently, and equivalents thereof. By way of a second example on substituent terminology, if it is herein described that substituent S\nexa\nmpie is one of Si , S\n2\n, and S\n3\n, this listing refers to embodiments of this invention for which S\nexa\nmpie is Si ; S\nexa\nmpie is S2;\n\n\nSexampie IS S3; Sexampie IS ΟΠβ Of Si and S2; Sexampie IS ΟΠβ Of Si and S3; Sexampie IS one of S2 and S3; S\nexa\nmpie is one of Si , S2 and S3; and S\nexa\nmpie is any equivalent of each one of these choices. The shorter terminology \"S\nexa\nmpie is one of Si , S\n2\n, and S3\" is accordingly used herein for the sake of brevity, but not by way of limitation. The foregoing second example on substituent terminology, which is stated in generic terms, is meant to illustrate the various substituent \n\n\nassignments described herein. The foregoing convention given herein for substituents extends, when applicable, to members such as R\n1\n , R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, A, \n\n R\na\n, R\nb\n, R\nc\n, R\nd\n, R\ne\n, R\nf\n, R\ng\n, R\nh\n, R', R\nj\n, and R\nk\n, and any other generic substituent symbol used herein. \n\n\n The nomenclature \"C. \" with j > i, when applied herein to a class of substituents, is meant to refer to embodiments of this invention for which each and every one of the number of carbon members, from i to j including i and j, is independently realized. By way of example, the term Ci-3 refers independently to embodiments that have one carbon member (Ci ), embodiments that have two carbon members (C2), and embodiments that have three carbon members (Cs). \n\n\n The term Cn\n-m\nalkyl refers to an aliphatic chain, whether straight or branched, with a total number N of carbon members in the chain that satisfies n < N < m, with m > n. Any disubstituent referred to herein is meant to \n\n\nencompass the various attachment possibilities when more than one of such possibilities are allowed. For example, reference to disubstituent -A-B-, where A≠ B, refers herein to such disubstituent with A attached to a first substituted member and B attached to a second substituted member, and it also refers to such disubstituent with A attached to the second substituted member and B attached to the first substituted member. \n\n\n According to the foregoing interpretive considerations on assignments and nomenclature, it is understood that explicit reference herein to a set implies, where chemically meaningful and unless indicated otherwise, independent reference to embodiments of such set, and reference to each and every one of the possible embodiments of subsets of the set referred to explicitly. \n\n\n In certain embodiments of compounds of Formula (I), n is 0. \n\n\n In certain embodiments of compounds of Formula (I), n is 1 . \n\n\n In certain embodiments of compounds of Formula (I), R\n1\n is phenyl substituted with R\na\n, where R\na\n is a member selected from the group consisting of: -H, -F, -Ci\n-4\nalkoxy, and -CH\n3,\n and R\nb\n is a member selected from the group consisting of: -Br, -OCH3, thiophen-2-yl, 2H-1 ,2,3-triazole, 1 H-1 ,2,3-triazol-1 -yl, 1 H-pyrazol-1 -yl, 1 H-pyrazol-5-yl, pyrimidin-2-yl, 3-methyl-1 ,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl, and phenyl. \n\n In certain embodiments of compounds of Formula (I), R\na\n is a member selected from the group consisting of: -H, -F, -OCH\n3,\n and -CH\n3\n \n\n\n In certain embodiments of compounds of Formula (I), R\n1\n is (2-fluoro- phenyl)-2-methyl-thiazol-4-yl. \n\n\n In certain embodiments of compounds of Formula (I), R\n1\n is biphenyl-2-yl,\n\n\n2-thiophen-2-yl-phenyl, 2-bromophenyl, 2,6-dimethoxy-phenyl, 2-(3-methyl- 1 ,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)phenyl, 2-[1 ,2,3]triazol-2-yl-phenyl, 3-fluoro-2-[1 ,2,3]triazol- 2-yl-phenyl, 2-fluoro-6-[1 ,2,3]triazol-2-yl-phenyl, 3-fluoro-2-(1 H-1 ,2,3-triazol-1 -

A pharmaceutical composition therefore comprises an effective amount of at least one a compound of Formula (I) and Formula (II) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. \n\n\n The invention includes also pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of Formula (I) and Formula (II), preferably of those described above and of the specific compounds exemplified herein, and methods of treatment using such salts. \n\n\n A \"pharmaceutically acceptable salt\" is intended to mean a salt of a free acid or base of a compound represented by Formula (I) and Formula (II), that is non-toxic, biologically tolerable, or otherwise biologically suitable for \n\n\nadministration to the subject. See, generally, G.S. Paulekuhn, et al., \"Trends in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Salt Selection based on Analysis of the\n\n\nOrange Book Database\", J. Med. Chem., 2007, 50:6665-72, S.M. Berge, et al., \"Pharmaceutical Salts\", J Pharm Sci., 1977, 66:1 -19, and Handbook of \n\n\nPharmaceutical Salts, Properties, Selection, and Use, Stahl and Wermuth, Eds., Wiley-VCH and VHCA, Zurich, 2002. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those that are pharmacologically effective and suitable for contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, or allergic response. A compound of Formula (I) and Formula (II) may possess a sufficiently acidic group, a sufficiently basic group, or both types of functional groups, and accordingly react with a number of inorganic or organic bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. \n\n\n bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. \n\n\n Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include sulfates, pyrosulfates, bisulfates, sulfites, bisulfites, phosphates, monohydrogen- phosphates, dihydrogenphosphates, metaphosphates, pyrophosphates, chlorides, bromides, iodides, acetates, propionates, decanoates, caprylates, acrylates, formates, isobutyrates, caproates, heptanoates, propiolates, oxalates, malonates, succinates, suberates, sebacates, fumarates, maleates, \n\n butyne-1 ,4-dioates, hexyne-1 ,6-dioates, benzoates, chlorobenzoates, methylbenzoates, dinitrobenzoates, hydroxybenzoates, methoxybenzoates, phthalates, sulfonates, xylenesulfonates, phenylacetates, phenylpropionates, phenylbutyrates, citrates, lactates, γ-hydroxybutyrates, glycolates, tartrates, methane-sulfonates, propanesulfonates, naphthalene-1 -sulfonates, \n\n\nnaphthalene-2-sulfonates, and mandelates. \n\n\n When the compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II) contains a basic nitrogen, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art, for example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, nitric acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, phenylacetic acid, propionic acid, stearic acid, lactic acid, ascorbic acid, maleic acid, hydroxymaleic acid, isethionic acid, succinic acid, valeric acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, lauric acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid, such as mandelic acid, citric acid, or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid, glutaric acidor glutamic acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid, 2- acetoxybenzoic acid, naphthoic acid, or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as laurylsulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, any compatible mixture of acids such as those given as examples herein, and any other acid and mixture thereof that are regarded as equivalents or acceptable substitutes in light of the ordinary level of skill in this technology. \n\n\n When the compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II) is an acid, such as a carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal hydroxide, alkaline earth metal hydroxide, any compatible mixture of bases such as those given as examples herein, and any other base and mixture thereof that are regarded as equivalents or acceptable substitutes in light of the ordinary level of skill in this technology. Illustrative examples of suitable salts include organic salts derived from amino acids, such as N-methyl-D-glucamine, lysine, choline, glycine and arginine, ammonia, \n\n carbonates, bicarbonates, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, and cyclic amines, such as tromethamine, benzylamines, pyrrolidines, piperidine, morpholine, and piperazine, and inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum, and lithium. \n\n\n The invention also relates to pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of the compounds of Formula (I) and Formula (II), and treatment methods employing such pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs. The term \"prodrug\" means a precursor of a designated compound that, following administration to a subject, yields the compound in vivo via a chemical or physiological process such as solvolysis or enzymatic cleavage, or under physiological conditions (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to physiological pH is converted to the compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II)). A \"pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug\" is a prodrug that is non-toxic, biologically tolerable, and otherwise biologically suitable for administration to the subject. Illustrative procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in \"Design of Prodrugs\" , ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985. \n\n\n Exemplary prodrugs include compounds having an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues, covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxy, or carboxylic acid group of a compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II). Examples of amino acid residues include the twenty naturally occurring amino acids, commonly designated by three letter symbols, as well as 4- hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvalin, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, citrulline homocysteine, homoserine, ornithine and methionine sulfone. \n\n\n Additional types of prodrugs may be produced, for instance, by derivatizing free carboxyl groups of structures of Formula (I) or Formula (II), as amides or alkyl esters. Examples of amides include those derived from ammonia, primary C\nh\nalky! amines and secondary di(Ci-\n6\nalkyl) amines. \n\n\nSecondary amines include 5- or 6-membered heterocycloalkyl or heteroaryl ring moieties. Examples of amides include those that are derived from ammonia, Ci\n-3\nalkyl primary amines, and di(Ci\n-2\nalkyl)amines. Examples of esters of the invention include Ci\n-7\nalkyl, C\n5-7\ncycloalkyl, phenyl, and phenyl(Ci- \n\n 6alkyl) esters. Preferred esters include methyl esters. Prodrugs may also be prepared by derivatizing free hydroxy groups using groups including \n\n\nhemisuccinates, phosphate esters, dimethylaminoacetates, and \n\n\nphosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyls, following procedures such as those outlined in Fleisher et al., Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 1996, 19, 1 15-130. Carbamate derivatives of hydroxy and amino groups may also yield prodrugs. Carbonate derivatives, sulfonate esters, and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups may also provide prodrugs. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers, wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester, optionally substituted with one or more ether, amine, or carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, is also useful to yield prodrugs. Prodrugs of this type may be prepared as described in Robinson et al, J Med Chem. 1996, 39 (1 ), 10-18. Free amines can also be derivatized as amides, sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these prodrug moieties may incorporate groups including ether, amine, and carboxylic acid functionalities. \n\n\n The present invention also relates to pharmaceutically active metabolites of the compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II), which may also be used in the methods of the invention. A \"pharmaceutically active metabolite\" means a pharmacologically active product of metabolism in the body of a compound of Formula (I) or Formula (II) or salt thereof. Prodrugs and active metabolites of a compound may be determined using routine techniques known or available in the art. See, e.g., Bertolini, et al., J Med Chem. 1997, 40, 201 1 -2016; Shan, et al., J Pharm Sci. 1997, 86 (7), 765-767; Bagshawe, Drug Dev Res. 1995, 34, 220-230; Bodor, Adv Drug Res. 1984, 13, 224-331 ; Bundgaard, Design of Prodrugs (Elsevier Press, 1985); and Larsen, Design and Application of Prodrugs, Drug Design and Development (Krogsgaard-Larsen, et al., eds., Harwood Academic Publishers, 1991 ). \n\n\n The compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, and pharmaceutically active metabolites of the present invention are useful as modulators of the orexin receptor in the methods of the invention. As such modulators, the compounds may act as antagonists, agonists, or inverse agonists. The term \n\n \"modulators\" include both inhibitors and activators, where \"inhibitors\" refer to compounds that decrease, prevent, inactivate, desensitize or down-regulate orexin receptor expression or activity, and \"activators\" are compounds that increase, activate, facilitate, sensitize, or up-regulate orexin receptor \n\n\nexpression or activity. \n\n\n The term \"treat\" or \"treating\" as used herein is intended to refer to administration of an active agent or composition of the invention to a subject for the purpose of effecting a therapeutic or prophylactic benefit through \n\n\nmodulation of orexin receptor activity. Treating includes reversing, \n\n\nameliorating, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, lessening the severity of, or preventing a disease, disorder, or condition, or one or more symptoms of such disease, disorder or condition mediated through modulation of orexin receptor activity. The term \"subject\" refers to a mammalian patient in need of such treatment, such as a human. \n\n\n Accordingly, the invention relates to methods of using the compounds described herein to treat subjects diagnosed with or suffering from a disease, disorder, or condition mediated by orexin receptor activity, such as: disorders of the sleep-wake cycle, metabolic disorders, neurological disorders and other disorders (e.g., feeding, drinking, arousal, stress, addiction, metabolism and reproduction). Symptoms or disease states are intended to be included within the scope of \"medical conditions, disorders, or diseases.\" \n\n\n Sleep disorders include, but are not limited to, sleep-wake transition disorders, insomnia, restless legs syndrome, jet-lag, disturbed sleep, and sleep disorders secondary to neurological disorders (e.g., manias, depressions, manic depression, schizophrenia, and pain syndromes (e.g., fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain). \n\n\n Metabolic disorders include, but are not limited to, overweight or obesity and conditions related to overweight or obesity, such as insulin resistance, type II diabetes, hyperlipidemia, gallstones, angina, hypertension, breathlessness, tachycardia, infertility, sleep apnea, back and joint pain, varicose veins and osteoarthritis. \n\n Neurological disorders include, but are not limited to, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Tourette's Syndrome, catatonia, anxiety, delirium and dementias. \n\n\n Other disorders include, but are not limited to, ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome, diarrhea and gastroesophageal reflux. \n\n\n In treatment methods according to the invention, an effective amount of a pharmaceutical agent according to the invention is administered to a subject suffering from or diagnosed as having such a disease, disorder, or condition. An \"effective amount\" means an amount or dose sufficient to generally bring about the desired therapeutic or prophylactic benefit in patients in need of such treatment for the designated disease, disorder, or condition. Effective amounts or doses of the compounds of the present invention may be ascertained by routine methods such as modeling, dose escalation studies or clinical trials, and by taking into consideration routine factors, e.g., the mode or route of administration or drug delivery, the pharmacokinetics of the compound, the severity and course of the disease, disorder, or condition, the subject's previous or ongoing therapy, the subject's health status and response to drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. An example of a dose is in the range of from about 0.001 to about 200 mg of compound per kg of subject's body weight per day, preferably about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg/day, or about 1 to 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided dosage units (e.g., BID, TID, QID). For a 70-kg human, an illustrative range for a suitable dosage amount is from about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, or about 0.2 to about 2.5 g/day. \n\n\n Once improvement of the patient's disease, disorder, or condition has occurred, the dose may be adjusted for preventative or maintenance treatment. For example, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect is maintained. Of course, if symptoms have been alleviated to an appropriate level, treatment may cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms. \n\n\n In addition, the active agents of the invention may be used in \n\n\ncombination with additional active ingredients in the treatment of the above \n\n conditions. The additional active ingredients may be coadministered separately with an active agent of compounds of Table 1 or included with such an agent in a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention. In an exemplary embodiment, additional active ingredients are those that are known or discovered to be effective in the treatment of conditions, disorders, or diseases mediated by orexin activity, such as another orexin modulator or a compound active against another target associated with the particular condition, disorder, or disease. The combination may serve to increase efficacy (e.g., by including in the combination a compound potentiating the potency or effectiveness of an active agent according to the invention), decrease one or more side effects, or decrease the required dose of the active agent according to the invention. \n\n\n The active agents of the invention are used, alone or in combination with one or more additional active ingredients, to formulate pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises: (a) an effective amount of at least one active agent in accordance with the invention; and (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. \n\n\n A \"pharmaceutically acceptable excipient\" refers to a substance that is non-toxic, biologically tolerable, and otherwise biologically suitable for administration to a subject, such as an inert substance, added to a \n\n\npharmacological composition or otherwise used as a vehicle, carrier, or diluent to facilitate administration of a agent and that is compatible therewith. \n\n\nExamples of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils, and polyethylene glycols. \n\n\n Delivery forms of the pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more dosage units of the active agents may be prepared using suitable pharmaceutical excipients and compounding techniques known or that become available to those skilled in the art. The compositions may be administered in the inventive methods by a suitable route of delivery, e.g., oral, parenteral, rectal, topical, or ocular routes, or by inhalation. \n\n\n The preparation may be in the form of tablets, capsules, sachets, dragees, powders, granules, lozenges, powders for reconstitution, liquid \n\n preparations, or suppositories. Preferably, the compositions are formulated for intravenous infusion, topical administration, or oral administration. \n\n\n For oral administration, the compounds of the invention can be provided in the form of tablets or capsules, or as a solution, emulsion, or suspension. To prepare the oral compositions, the compounds may be formulated to yield a dosage of, e.g., from about 0.05 to about 100 mg/kg daily, or from about 0.05 to about 35 mg/kg daily, or from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg daily. For example, a total daily dosage of about 5 mg to 5 g daily may be accomplished by dosing once, twice, three, or four times per day. \n\n\n Oral tablets may include a compound according to the invention mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, \n\n\ndisintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preservative agents. Suitable inert fillers include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, lactose, starch, sugar, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sorbitol, and the like. Exemplary liquid oral excipients include ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Starch, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP), sodium starch glycolate, microcrystalline cellulose, and alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin. The lubricating agent, if present, may be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl \n\n\nmonostearate or glyceryl distearate to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, or may be coated with an enteric coating. \n\n\n Capsules for oral administration include hard and soft gelatin capsules. To prepare hard gelatin capsules, compounds of the invention may be mixed with a solid, semi-solid, or liquid diluent. Soft gelatin capsules may be prepared by mixing the compound of the invention with water, an oil such as peanut oil or olive oil, liquid paraffin, a mixture of mono and di-glycerides of short chain fatty acids, polyethylene glycol 400, or propylene glycol. \n\n\n Liquids for oral administration may be in the form of suspensions, solutions, emulsions or syrups or may be lyophilized or presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid compositions may optionally contain: pharmaceutically-acceptable \n\n excipients such as suspending agents (for example, sorbitol, methyl cellulose, sodium alginate, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminum stearate gel and the like); non-aqueous vehicles, e.g., oil (for example, almond oil or fractionated coconut oil), propylene glycol, ethyl alcohol, or water; preservatives (for example, methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid); wetting agents such as lecithin; and, if desired, flavoring or coloring agents. \n\n\n The active agents of this invention may also be administered by non-oral routes. For example, the compositions may be formulated for rectal \n\n\nadministration as a suppository. For parenteral use, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous routes, the compounds of the invention may be provided in sterile aqueous solutions or suspensions, buffered to an appropriate pH and isotonicity or in parenterally acceptable oil. Suitable aqueous vehicles include Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride. Such forms will be presented in unit-dose form such as ampules or disposable injection devices, in multi-dose forms such as vials from which the appropriate dose may be withdrawn, or in a solid form or pre-concentrate that can be used to prepare an injectable formulation. Illustrative infusion doses may range from about 1 to 1000 g/kg/minute of compound, admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier over a period ranging from several minutes to several days. \n\n\n For topical administration, the compounds may be mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier at a concentration of about 0.1 % to about 10% of drug to vehicle. Another mode of administering the compounds of the invention may utilize a patch formulation to affect transdermal delivery. \n\n\n Compounds of the invention may alternatively be administered in methods of this invention by inhalation, via the nasal or oral routes, e.g., in a spray formulation also containing a suitable carrier. \n\n\n Exemplary compounds useful in methods of the invention will now be described by reference to the illustrative synthetic schemes for their general preparation below and the specific examples that follow. Artisans will recognize that, to obtain the various compounds herein, starting materials may be suitably selected so that the ultimately desired substituents will be carried through the \n\n reaction scheme with or without protection as appropriate to yield the desired product. Alternatively, it may be necessary or desirable to employ, in the place of the ultimately desired substituent, a suitable group that may be carried through the reaction scheme and replaced as appropriate with the desired substituent. Unless otherwise specified, the variables are as defined above in reference to Formula (I).

After centrifugation (2K xG, 10 min at 4°C), the supernatant was aspirated and the pellets frozen and stored at -80°C. Cells were resuspended in PBS in the presence of 1 tablet of protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Cat. #1 1836145001 ) per 50 mL. Each cell pellet from a 15 cm plate was resuspended in 10 mL, stored on ice, and vortexed for 45 sec prior to addition to the reactions. Competition binding experiments in 96 well polypropylene plates were performed using [\n3\nH]-SB674042 (Moravek \n\n\nCorporation, specific activity = 35.3 Ci/mmol), diluted to a 10 nM concentration in PBS (4 nM final). Compounds were solubilized in 100% DMSO (Acros Organics, Cat. #61042-1000) and tested over a range of 7 concentrations (from 0.1 nM to 10 μΜ). The final concentration of DMSO in the reactions is equal to or less than 0.1 %. Total and nonspecific binding was determined in the absence and presence of 10 μΜ (1 -(6,8-difluoro-2-methylquinolin-4-yl)-3-[4- (dimethylamino)phenyl]urea, CAS Registry # 288150-92-5). The total volume \n\n of each reaction is 200 μΙ_ (20 μΙ_ of diluted compounds, 80 μΙ_ of [\n3\nH]- SB674042 diluted in PBS and 100 μΙ_ of the cell suspension). Reactions were run for 60 min at room temperature and terminated by filtration through GF/C filter plates (PerkinElmer, Cat. #6005174) presoaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine using the cell harvester (PerkinElmer Filtermate). The plates were washed 3 times by aspirating 30 ml PBS through the plates. Plates were dried in 55°C oven for 60 min, scintillation fluid was added, and the radioactivity was counted on a Topcount (Packard). \n\n\n IC\n5\no values (i.e. concentration of unlabelled compound required to compete for 50% of specific binding to the radioligand) were calculated using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, CA) with a fit to a sigmoidal dose-response curve. Apparent K, values were calculated as K, = IC\n5\no/(1 \n+\nC/Kd), where C is concentration of radioligand and K\nd\n = 4 nM. \n\n\nHuman orexin 2 receptor radioligand binding studies \n\n\n HEK293 stably expressing human orexin-2 receptor (Genebank accession number NM_001526) were grown to confluency in DMEM/F12 (Gibco, Cat #1 1039), in DMEM, 10%FBS, 1 X Pen/Strep, 1 X NaPyruvate, 1X HEPES, 600 ug/ml G418 media on 150 cm\n2\n tissue culture plates, washed with 5 mM EDTA in PBS (HyClone Dulbecco's Phoshpate Buffered Saline 1X with Calcium and Magnesium, Cat # SH30264.01 , hereafter referred to simply as PBS) and scraped into 50 ml tubes.

Total and nonspecific binding was determined in the \n\n absence and presence of 10 μΜ (N-[2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl]-N- methylnaphthalene-1 -carboxamide, CAS Registry # 1089563-88-1 ). The total volume of each reaction is 200 μΙ_ (20 μΙ_ of diluted compounds, 80 μΙ_ of [\n3\nH]- EMPA diluted in PBS and 100 μΙ_ of the cell suspension).
