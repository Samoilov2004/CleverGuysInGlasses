Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to aziridinyl-epothilone analogs pharmaceutical compositions comprising aziridinyl-epothilone analogs, and methods of using the same.\n\n\n2. Related Background Art\n\n\nEpothilones A and B are naturally-occurring compounds that were discovered by Höfle et al. as isolated from fermentation products of the microorganism, \nSorangium cellulosum \n(see, e.g., WO 93/10121). Höfle et al. also discovered 37 natural epothilone variants and related compounds produced by \nSorangium cellulosum\n, including epothilones C, D, E, F and other isomers and variants. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,624,310. While in 1993 Höfle et al reported on cytotoxic effects of Epothilones A and B, in 1995 researchers with Merck reported that epothilone B exerts microtubule-stabilizing effects similar to paclitaxel (TAXOL®) (See D. M. Bollag, “Epothilones, a New Class of Microtubule-Stabilizing Agents with a Taxol-like Mechanism of Action,” Cancer Research, Vol. 55 (June 1995), at pp. 2325-2333).\n\n\nVarious derivatives and analogs of the naturally-occurring epothilones have been discovered at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Examples of epothilone analogs include the aza-epothilone B analog known as ixabepilone, 21-substituted analogs of epothilone B including a 21-amino analog, 2,3-olefinic analogs, C-3 cyano analogs, cyclopropyl analogs, and heterocyclic analogs including aziridinyl-epothilone analogs. See, e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,605,599; 6,262,094; 6,399,638; 6,498,257; 6,380,395; and 6,800,653, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Others have also reported on the discovery of other epothilone derivatives and analogs. See, e.g., PCT Pub. Nos.

Often, however, anticancer drugs attack not only tumor cells but also normal tissue, leading to undesired side effects. Additionally, anticancer drugs typically present solubility issues such that formulation and delivery of the agents can present challenges, leading to use of solubilizing agents such as CREMOPHOR®. The cytotoxicity of some anticancer drugs and/or formulation ingredients has been known to cause neuropathy or other side effects such as hypersensitivity reactions. These adverse side effects highlight the need for anticancer therapies that are selective for pathogenic cell populations and therefore result in reduced host toxicity.\n\n\nHowever, as discussed in WO 2004/054622 A1 scientists have for many years attempted to use monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in targeted drug therapies for delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to patients, but drawbacks have been encountered in terms of, inter alia, the cleavable moiety, the linkers, and the form of drug released in the cell. It has been reported that successful therapy of tumors with mAbs is limited by inadequate penetration of the antibody in the tumor and by the heterogeneous distribution of corresponding tumor-associated antigen in the tumor tissue. See, Klar et al., WO 05/074901 (assigned to Schering AG).\n\n\nUS Pat. App. Pub. No. 2005/0002942 discloses vitamin receptor binding drug delivery conjugates that are useful for targeted drug delivery. There is a need in the art for identifying anticancer agents that could be used to make conjugates such as those described in US 2005/0002942, in the interest of providing targeted drug delivery for cancer treatment.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is directed to compounds having the following Formula X:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nor pharmaceutically-acceptable salts and/or solvates thereof, wherein:\n\n\nK is —O—, —S—, or —NR\n7\n—;\n\n\nA is —(CR\n8\nR\n9\n)—(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-Z- wherein Z is —(CHR\n10\n)—, —C(═O)—, —C(═O)—C(═O)—, —OC(═O)—, —N(R\n11\n)C(═O)—, —SO\n2\n—, or —N(R\n11\n)SO\n2\n—;\n\n\nB\n1 \nis hydroxyl or cyano and R\n1 \nis hydrogen or B\n1 \nand R\n1 \nare taken together to form a double bond;\n\n\nR\n2\n, R\n3\n, and R\n5 \nare, independently, hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl; or R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nmay be taken together with the carbon to which they are attached to form an optionally substituted cycloalkyl;\n\n\nR\n4 \nis hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkyl, substituted alkenyl, aryl, or substituted aryl;\n\n\nR\n6 \nis hydrogen, alkyl or substituted alkyl;\n\n\nR\n7\n, R\n8\n, R\n9\n, R\n10\n, and R\n11 \nare independently hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted cycloalkyl, aryl, substituted aryl, heterocycloalkyl, substituted heterocycloalkyl, heteroaryl, or substituted heteroaryl;\n\n\nR\n12 \nis H, alkyl, substituted alkyl, or halogen;\n\n\nR\n13 \nis aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl or substituted heteroaryl; and\n\n\nm is 0 to 6.\n\n\nThe present invention is further directed to methods for treating cancer with use of compounds having the Formula X, as well as use of the compounds of Formula X in preparing pharmaceutical compositions with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for treating cancer.

The initial definition provided for a group or term herein applies to that group or term throughout the present specification individually or as part of another group, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\nThe term “folate-binding moiety or analog or derivative thereof” as used herein means a moiety that will bind to a folate-receptor protein (not a monoclonal antibody) that is overexpressed or preferentially expressed on cancer cells. For example, it is known that the folate receptor (FR) is over-expressed in ovarian cancer cells and other cancer cells. Illustrative analogs and derivatives of folate are disclosed in US Pat. App. Pub. No. 2005/0002942 to Vlahov et al., (hereinafter “Vlahov”), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe term “releasable linker” as used herein means a bivalent linker that includes at least one cleavable bond that can be broken under physiological conditions (e.g. a pH-labile, reductively-labile, acid-labile, oxidatively-labile, or enzyme-labile bond.) It should be appreciated that such physiological conditions resulting in bond breaking include standard chemical hydrolysis reactions that occur, for example, at physiological pH, or as a result of compartmentalization into a cellular organelle, such as an endosome having a lower pH than cytosolic pH, or as a result of reaction with a cellular reducing agent such as glutathione.\n\n\nIt is understood that a cleavable bond can connect two adjacent atoms within the releasable linker and/or connect other groups to the releasable linker such as Q and K, as described herein, at either or both ends of the linker.\n\n\nThe terms “alkyl” and “alk” whether alone or in combination with some other group, refer to a straight or branched chain alkane (hydrocarbon) radical attached at any available carbon atom, containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Exemplary such groups include, but are not limited to methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, 4,4-dimethylpentyl, octyl, 2,2,4-trimethylpentyl, and the like. “Lower alkyl” or “lower alkylene” means a straight or branched chain alkyl having one to four carbon atoms. When a subscript is used with reference to an alkyl or other group, the subscript refers to the number of carbon atoms that the group may contain. For example, the term “C\n0-4\nalkyl” includes a bond and alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and the term “C\n1-4\nalkyl” means alkyl groups of 1 to 4 carbon atoms.\n\n\nThe term “alkylene” refers to a bivalent hydrocarbon radical, as described above for “alkyl” but with two points of attachment. For example, a methylene group is a —CH\n2\n— group and an ethylene group is a —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— group.\n\n\nWhen the term alkyl is used in connection with another group, as in heterocycloalkyl or cycloalkylalkyl, this means the other identified (first named) group is bonded directly through an alkyl group as defined above (e.g., which may be branched or straight chain). Thus, the term “alkyl” is used in this instance to refer to an alkylene, e.g., a divalent alkyl group, having two available points of attachment. For example, cyclopropyl C\n1-4\nalkyl means a cyclopropyl group bonded through a straight or branched chain alkylene having one to four carbon atoms, and hydroxyalkyl means the group OH bonded through a straight or branched chain alkylene having one to ten carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms. In the case of substituents, as in “substituted cycloalkylalkyl,” the alkylene portion of the group, besides being branched or straight chain, may be substituted as recited below for substituted alkyl groups and/or the first named group (e.g., cycloalkyl) may be substituted as recited herein for that named group (e.g., cycloalkyl).\n\n\n“Substituted alkyl” refers to an alkyl group substituted with one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents, at any available point of attachment. However, when an alkyl group is substituted with multiple halo substituents, the alkyl may contain as valence allows up to 10 substituents, more preferably up to seven substituents. Alkyl substituents may include one or more of the following groups: halo (e.g., a single halo substituent or multiple halo substituents forming, in the latter case, groups such as a perfluoroalkyl group or an alkyl group bearing Cl\n3 \nor CF\n3\n), cyano, —OR\na\n, —SR\na\n, —C(═O)R\na\n, —C(═O)OR\na\n, —OC(═O)R\na\n, —OC(═O)OR\na\n, —NR\na\nR\nb\n, —C(═O)NR\na\nR\nb\n, —OC(═O)NR\na\nR\nb\n, —S(═O)R\na\n, —S(O)\n2\nR\na\n, —NHS(O)\n2\nR\na\n, —NHS(O)\n2\nNHR\na\n, —NHC(═O)NHR\na\n, —NHC(═O)R\na\n, —NHC(O)\n2\nR\na\n, —NHC(═N—CN)R\na\n, aryl, heterocycle, cycloalkyl, and/or heteroaryl, wherein the groups R\na \nand R\nb \nare independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclo, aryl, and heteroaryl, and wherein each R\na \nand/or R\nb \nin turn is optionally substituted with one to four groups selected from alkyl, alkenyl, halogen, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, cyano, nitro, amino, alkylamino, aminoalkyl, hydroxy, hydroxyalkyl, alkoxy, thiol, alkylthio, phenyl, benzyl, phenyloxy, benzyloxy, C\n3-7\ncycloalkyl, five or six membered heterocyclo or heteroaryl, and/or a lower alkyl or lower alkenyl substituted with one to four groups selected from hydroxy, cyano, halogen, haloC\n1-4\nalkyl, haloC\n1-4\nalkoxy, cyano, nitro, amino, C\n1-4\nalkylamino, aminoC\n1-4\nalkyl, hydroxyC\n1-4\nalkyl, C\n1-4\nalkoxy, thiol, and/or C\n1-4 \nalkylthio. For the avoidance of doubt, a “substituted lower alkyl” means an alkyl group having one to four carbon atoms and one to four substituents selected from those recited immediately above for substituted alkyl groups. In the case of a substituted lower alkyl, preferably the groups R\na \nand R\nb \nare selected from hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, C\n3-7\ncycloalkyl, phenyl, and five to six membered monocyclic heterocyclo and/or heteroaryl, in turn optionally substituted as above.\n\n\nThe term “alkenyl” refers to a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radical containing from 2 to 12 carbon atoms and at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Exemplary such groups include ethenyl or allyl. “Substituted alkenyl” refers to an alkenyl group substituted with one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents, at any available point of attachment. Exemplary substituents include alkyl, substituted alkyl, and those groups recited above as alkyl substituents.\n\n\nThe terms “alkoxy” and “alkylthio” refer to an alkyl group as described above bonded through an oxygen linkage (—O—) or a sulfur linkage (—S—), respectively. The terms “substituted alkoxy” and “substituted alkylthio” refer to a substituted alkyl group as described above bonded through an oxygen or sulfur linkage, respectively. A “lower alkoxy” or a C\n1-4\nalkoxy is a group OR, wherein R is lower alkyl (alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms).\n\n\n“Amino” is NH\n2\n. An alkylamino is —NR\nc\nR\nd \nwherein at least one of R\nc \nand R\nd \nis an alkyl or substituted alkyl, and the other of R\nc \nand R\nd \nis selected from hydrogen, alkyl, and substituted alkyl. An “aminoalkyl” means an amino group bonded through an alkylene group (-alkylene-NH\n2\n), and an alkylaminoalkyl means an alkylamino as defined above bonded through an alkylene group (-alkylene-NR\nc\nR\nd\n).\n\n\nThe term “aryl” refers to cyclic, aromatic hydrocarbon groups which have 1 to 3 aromatic rings, especially monocyclic or bicyclic groups such as phenyl or naphthyl. Aryl groups which are bicyclic or tricyclic must include at least one fully aromatic carbocyclic ring but the other fused ring or rings may be aromatic or non-aromatic and may optionally contain heteroatoms, provided that in such cases the point of attachment will be to the aromatic carbocyclic ring. Additionally, when an aryl group has fused thereto a heterocyclic or cycloalkyl ring, the heterocyclic and/or cycloalkyl ring may have one or more carbonyl carbon atoms, i.e., attached via a double bond to an oxygen atom to define a carbonyl group. Thus, examples of “aryl” may include without limitation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term “arylene” refers to a bivalent aryl radical, i.e., an aryl group as defined above having two points of attachment to two other groups, at any available points of attachment of the aryl ring. Arylene rings may also be substituted with any of the groups suitable for substitution on the aryl groups defined herein.\n\n\n“Substituted aryl” refers to an aryl or arylene group as defined above substituted by one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents, at any point of attachment. Substituents include alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, as well as those groups recited above as alkyl substituents.\n\n\nThe term “carbocyclic” means a saturated or unsaturated monocyclic, bicyclic, or tricyclic ring (preferably mono- or bicyclic) in which all atoms of all rings are carbon. Thus, the term includes cycloalkyl and aryl rings. The carbocyclic ring may be substituted in which case the substituents are selected from those recited above for cycloalkyl and aryl groups.\n\n\nThe term “cycloalkyl” refers to a fully saturated or partially saturated cyclic hydrocarbon group containing from 1 to 3 rings and 3 to 7 carbon atoms per ring. Exemplary fully saturated cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. Exemplary partially saturated cycloalkyl groups include cyclobutenyl, cyclopentenyl, and cyclohexenyl. The term “cycloalkyl” includes such groups having a bridge of three to four carbon atoms. Additionally, cycloalkyl groups which are bicyclic or tricyclic must include at least one fully saturated or partially saturated hydrocarbon ring but the other fused ring or rings may be aromatic or non-aromatic and may contain heteroatoms, provided that in such cases the point of attachment will be to the cyclic, non-aromatic hydrocarbon group. Additionally, one or more carbon atoms of the cycloalkyl group may form a carbon-to-oxygen double bond to define a carbonyl group. Thus, examples of “cycloalkyl” groups may include, without limitation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term “cycloalkylene” refers to a bivalent cycloalkyl radical, i.e., a cycloalkyl group as defined above having two points of attachment to two other groups, at any available two points of attachment of the cycloalkyl ring.\n\n\n“Substituted cycloalkyl” refers to a cycloalkyl group as defined above substituted at any available point of attachment with one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents. Cycloalkyl substituents include alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, and those groups recited above as alkyl substituents.\n\n\nThe term “guanidinyl” means the group\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThus, a guanidinylalkyl means an alkyl group bonded to the guanidinyl such as a group having the formula,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe term “halogen” or “halo” refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.\n\n\nThe term “heteroatoms” includes oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen.\n\n\nThe term “haloalkyl” means an alkyl having one or more halo substituents, including without limitation groups such as —CH\n2\nF, —CHF\n2 \nand —CF\n3\n.\n\n\nThe term “haloalkoxy” means an alkoxy group having one or more halo substituents. For example, “haloalkoxy” includes —OCF\n3\n.\n\n\nWhen the term “unsaturated” is used herein to refer to a ring or group, the ring or group may be fully unsaturated or partially unsaturated.\n\n\nThe term “heteroaryl” refers to an aromatic group which is a 4 to 7 membered monocyclic, 7 to 11 membered bicyclic, or 10 to 15 membered tricyclic ring system, which has at least one ring containing at least one heteroatom. Each ring of the heteroaryl group containing a heteroatom can contain one or two oxygen or sulfur atoms and/or from one to four nitrogen atoms, provided that the total number of heteroatoms in each ring is four or less and each ring has at least one carbon atom. The fused rings completing the bicyclic and tricyclic groups may contain only carbon atoms and may be saturated, partially saturated, or unsaturated. The nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen atoms may optionally be quaternized. Heteroaryl groups which are bicyclic or tricyclic must include at least one fully aromatic ring but the other fused ring or rings may be aromatic or non-aromatic and may be carbocyclic, provided that in such cases the point of attachment will be at any available nitrogen or carbon atom of an aromatic heteroatom-containing ring. Additionally, the definition of heteroaryl groups itself includes rings wherein one or more of the carbon atoms is attached via a double bond to an oxygen atom to define a carbonyl group (provided the heteroaryl group is aromatic) and also when a heteroaryl group has fused thereto a heterocyclic or cycloalkyl ring, the heterocyclic and/or cycloalkyl ring may have one or more carbonyl groups.\n\n\nExemplary monocyclic heteroaryl groups include pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, pyrazolinyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl (i.e.,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nthiadiazolyl, isothiazolyl, furanyl, thienyl, oxadiazolyl, pyridyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, triazinyl and the like. Additionally, since the definition of heteroaryl groups itself includes rings wherein one or more of the carbon atoms defines a carbonyl group, rings such as 2,4-dihydro-[1,2,4]triazol-3-one (i.e.,\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nand the like are included.\n\n\n\nExemplary bicyclic heteroaryl groups include indolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzodioxolyl, benzoxaxolyl, benzothienyl, quinolinyl, tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, benzimidazolyl, benzopyranyl, indolizinyl, benzofuranyl, chromonyl, coumarinyl, benzopyranyl, cinnolinyl, quinoxalinyl, indazolyl, pyrrolopyridyl, furopyridinyl, dihydroisoindolyl, tetrahydroquinolinyl and the like.\n\n\nExemplary tricyclic heteroaryl groups include carbazolyl, benzidolyl, phenanthrollinyl, acridinyl, phenanthridinyl, xanthenyl and the like.\n\n\nThe term “heteroalkylene” refers to a bivalent heteroaryl radical, i.e., a heteroaryl group as defined above having two points of attachment to two other groups, at any available two points of attachment of the heteroaryl ring.\n\n\n“Substituted heteroaryl” groups are heteroaryl groups as defined above substituted with one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents, at any available point of attachment. Exemplary substituents include, but are not limited to alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, as well as those groups recited above as alkyl substituents.\n\n\nThe terms “heterocycle”, “heterocyclic” and “heterocyclo” are used interchangeably and each refer to a fully saturated or partially unsaturated nonaromatic cyclic group, which may be substituted or unsubstituted, for example, which is a 4 to 7 membered monocyclic, 7 to 11 membered bicyclic, or 10 to 15 membered tricyclic ring system, which has at least one heteroatom in at least one carbon atom-containing ring. Each ring of the heterocyclic group containing a heteroatom may have 1, 2 or 3 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms, where the nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms also optionally may be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatoms also optionally may be quaternized. Preferably two adjacent heteroatoms are not simultaneously selected from oxygen and nitrogen. Heterocyclic groups which are bicyclic or tricyclic must include at least one non-aromatic non-carbocyclic ring, but the other fused ring or rings may be aromatic or non-aromatic and may be carbocyclic, provided that in such cases the point of attachment will be at any available nitrogen or carbon atom of a non-aromatic heteroatom-containing ring. Additionally, the definition of heterocyclic groups itself includes rings wherein one or more of the carbon atoms is attached via a double bond to an oxygen atom to define a carbonyl group (provided the heterocyclic group is non-aromatic) and also when a heterocyclic group has fused thereto a further ring, such further ring may have one or more carbonyl groups.\n\n\nExemplary monocyclic heterocyclic groups include pyrrolidinyl, imidazolidinyl, tetrahydrofuryl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, pyrazolidinyl, imidazolinyl, pyrrolinyl, tetrahydropyranyl, morpholinyl, thiamorpholinyl, and the like.\n\n\n“Substituted heterocycle,” “substituted heterocyclic,” and “substituted heterocyclo” refer to heterocycle, heterocyclic, or heterocyclo groups as defined above substituted with one or more substituents, preferably 1 to 4 substituents, at any available point of attachment. Exemplary substituents include alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substituted alkenyl, as well as those groups recited above as exemplary alkyl substituents.\n\n\n“Hydroxy” refers to —OH.\n\n\n“Thiol” means the group —SH.\n\n\nThe term “quaternary nitrogen” refers to a tetravalent positively charged nitrogen atom including, for example, the positively charged nitrogen in a tetraalkylammonium group (e.g., tetramethylammonium or N-methylpyridinium), the positively charged nitrogen in protonated ammonium species (e.g., trimethylhydroammonium or N-hydropyridinium), the positively charged nitrogen in amine N-oxides (e.g., N-methyl-morpholine-N-oxide or pyridine-N-oxide), and the positively charged nitrogen in an N-amino-ammonium group (e.g., N-aminopyridinium).\n\n\nWhen a functional group is termed “protected”, this means that the group is in modified form to mitigate, especially preclude, undesired side reactions at the protected site. Suitable protecting groups for the methods and compounds described herein include, without limitation, those described in standard textbooks, including Greene, T. W. et al., \nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\n, Wiley, N.Y. (1991), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nAlternate Embodiments of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention comprises compounds having the following Formula X, as set forth in the Summary of Invention.\n\n\nThe present invention comprises compounds having the stereospecific form according to Formula X′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nincluding pharmaceutically-acceptable salts and/or solvates thereof, wherein,\n\n\nK is —O—, —S—, or —NR\n7\n—;\n\n\nA is —(CR\n8\nR\n9\n)—(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-Z- wherein Z is —(CHR\n10\n)—, —C(═O)—, —C(═O)—C(═O)—, —OC(═O)—, —N(R\n11\n)C(═O)—, —SO\n2\n—, or —N(R\n11\n)SO\n2\n—;\n\n\nB\n1 \nis hydroxyl or cyano and R\n1 \nis hydrogen or B\n1 \nand R\n1 \nare taken together to form a double bond;\n\n\nR\n2\n, R\n3\n, and R\n5 \nare, independently, hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl or substituted aryl;

In this embodiment, a conjugated compound is delivered to the tumor site, and then the compound of formulae X, Xa, Xa′, Xb, or Xb′, as defined above, is released at the tumor site and treats the patient at the tumor site. It is therefore understood herein, whenever the term “treatment” is used with reference to treating a patient, that this encompasses treatment at the tumor site, however delivered, e.g., via a conjugated compound.\n\n\nThe use of an agent to upregulate the level of folate receptor (FR) may be effective to increase the FR expression in certain cancer cells or tumor types to enhance the advantages obtained upon administering the compounds of the invention to patients, and/or to enhance the various diseases or tumor types that may be treated with the folate receptor binding compounds according to the invention. The expression of folate receptor in certain cancers may be upregulated by the administration of a folate receptor inducer, which selectively increases the level of folate receptor in the cancer cells, thus enhancing the effectiveness a folate receptor targeted therapy. For example, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers express low levels of folate receptors. Treatment with a folate receptor inducer, such tamoxifen, an estrogen antagonist, is known to upregulate the expression of folate receptors in ER+ breast cancers, increasing the ER+ breast cancer cells susceptibility to treatment with a folate receptor targeted therapy.\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention provides a method of treating cancer or a proliferative disease in a patient, comprising optionally administering to a patient an effective amount of at least one folate receptor inducer, and treating the patient with an effective amount of at least one compound according to formula X. The folate receptor inducer may be administered before, during, or after the patient is treated with the compound according to formula X. In one embodiment, the folate receptor inducer is administered prior to treatment with the compound of formula X. An effective amount of the folate receptor inducer refers to an amount that upregulates the folate receptor in the desired cells such that the treatment with the compound is therapeutically effective.\n\n\nExamples of folate receptor inducers for the upregulation of folate receptor α (FRα) include: estrogen receptor antagonists such as tamoxifen; progesterone receptor agonists such as progestin; androgen receptor agonists such as testosterone and dihydroxytestosterone, and glucocorticoid receptor agonists such as dexamethasone.\n\n\nExamples of folate receptor inducers for the upregulation of folate receptor β (FRβ) include: retinoic acid receptor agonists such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), tetramethyl napthalenyl propenyl benzoic acid (TTNPB), 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cis RA), CD33336, LG101093, and CD2781.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a method of treating cancer or a proliferative disease in a patient in need thereof is provided, comprising administering an effective amount of at least one folate receptor inducer and also treating the patient with at least one compound according to formula X; wherein said folate receptor inducer upregulates folate receptor α. Preferably, said cancer or proliferative disease is selected from breast cancer, such as ER+ breast cancer, and ovarian cancer.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, a method of treating cancer or a proliferative disease in a patient in need thereof is provided, comprising administering an effective amount of at least one folate receptor inducer and administering an effective amount of at least one compound according to formula X; wherein said folate receptor inducer upregulates folate receptor β. Preferably, said cancer or proliferative disease is selected from leukemia, and more preferably from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, a method of treating cancer or a proliferative disease in a patient in need thereof is provided, comprising administering an effective amount of at least one folate receptor inducer, administering at least one histone deacetylase inhibitor, and treating the patient with an effective amount of at least one compound according to formula X. An example of a histone deacetylase inhibitor is trichostatin A (TSA). U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0170299 A1, WO 2004/082463, Kelly, K. M., B. G. Rowan, and M. Ratnam, \nCancer Research \n63, 2820-2828 (2003), Wang, Zheng, Behm, and Ratnam, \nBlood, \n96:3529-3536 (2000).\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may form salts or solvates which are also within the scope of this invention. Reference to a compound of the formula (X) herein is understood to include reference to salts and solvates thereof, racemates, diastereomers, and enantiomers thereof, unless otherwise indicated. The term “salt(s)”, as employed herein, denotes acidic and/or basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids and bases. In addition, when a compound of formula (X) contains both a basic moiety, such as but not limited to a pyridinyl imidazolyl, amine or guanidinyl and an acidic moiety such as but not limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions may be formed and are included within the term “salt(s)” as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful, e.g., in isolation or purification steps which may be employed during preparation. Salts of the compounds of the formula (X) may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of formula (X) with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (X) that contain a basic moiety, such as but not limited to an amine, a guanidinyl group, or a pyridyl or imidazolyl ring, may form salts with a variety of organic and inorganic acids. Exemplary acid addition salts include acetates (such as those formed with acetic acid or trihaloacetic acid, for example, trifluoroacetic acid), adipates, alginates, ascorbates, aspartates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates, cyclopentanepropionates, digluconates, dodecylsulfates, ethanesulfonates, fumarates, glucoheptanoates, glycerophosphates, hemisulfates, heptanoates, hexanoates, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, hydroiodides, hydroxyethanesulfonates (e.g., 2-hydroxyethanesulfonates), lactates, maleates, methanesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates (e.g., 2-naphthalenesulfonates), nicotinates, nitrates, oxalates, pectinates, persulfates, phenylpropionates (e.g., 3-phenylpropionates), phosphates, picrates, pivalates, propionates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates (such as those formed with sulfuric acid), sulfonates (such as those mentioned herein), tartrates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates such as tosylates, undecanoates, and the like.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (X) that contain an acidic moiety, such as but not limited to a carboxylic acid, may form salts with a variety of organic and inorganic bases. Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts; alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts; salts with organic bases (for example, organic amines) such as benzathines, dicyclohexylamines, hydrabamines (formed with N,N-bis(dehydroabietyl)ethylenediamine), N-methyl-D-glucamines, N-methyl-D-glycamides, t-butyl amines; and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine, and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g. dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g. decyl, lauryl, myristyl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g. benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others.\n\n\nSolvates of the compounds of the invention are also contemplated herein. Solvates of the compounds of formula (X) include, for example, hydrates.\n\n\nAll stereoisomers of the present compounds (for example, those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on various substituents), including enantiomeric forms and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention. Thus, for example, each reference to compounds of Formula X, is intended to encompass compounds of Formula X′. Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may, for example, be substantially free of other isomers (e.g., as a pure or substantially pure optical isomer having a specified activity), or may be admixed, for example, as racemates or with all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention may have the S or R configuration as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations. Racemic forms can be resolved by physical methods, such as, for example, fractional crystallization, separation or crystallization of diastereomeric derivatives, or separation by chiral column chromatography. Individual optical isomers can be obtained from stereospecific processes, wherein starting materials and/or intermediates are selected having a stereochemistry corresponding with that desired for the end products, and the stereochemistry is maintained throughout the reactions, and/or the isomers can be obtained from racemates by any suitable method, including without limitation, conventional methods, such as, for example, salt formation with an optically active acid followed by crystallization.\n\n\nAll configurational isomers of the compounds of the present invention are contemplated, either in admixture, or in pure or substantially pure form. As can be appreciated, the preferred configuration can be a function of the particular compound and the activity desired. Configurational isomers may be prepared by the processes described herein, which may be stereoselective. In other words, a desired stereochemistry for the final compounds can be achieved by using starting materials having the corresponding desired stereochemistry, and then maintaining the stereoselectivity throughout the process of preparation. Alternatively, the compounds may be prepared as racemates or diastereomers, and then the desired stereochemistry may be achieved via separation of configurational isomers which can be achieved by any suitable method known in the field, e.g., such as column chromatography.\n\n\nThroughout the specification, groups and substituents thereof may be chosen to provide stable moieties and compounds useful as pharmaceutically-acceptable compounds and/or intermediate compounds useful in making pharmaceutically-acceptable compounds. One skilled in the field will appreciate suitable selections for variables to achieve stable compounds.\n\n\nEmbodiments indicated herein as exemplary or preferred are intended to be illustrative and not limiting.\n\n\nOther embodiments of the invention will be apparent to one skilled in the field such as, for example, considering combinations of the embodiments referenced above, and are contemplated as covered within the scope of the invention herein.\n\n\nUtility\n\n\nOne of the proteins that is over-expressed or preferentially expressed in certain cancer cells is the folate receptor. Folic acid is required for DNA synthesis, and certain human tumor cells are known to over-express folate-binding proteins. For example, both Campbell et al., “Folate Binding Protein is a Marker for Ovarian Cancer,” Cancer Research, Vol. 51 (Oct. 1, 1991), at pp. 5329-38, and Coney et al., “Cloning of a Tumor-Associated Antigen: MOv18 and MOv19 Antibodies Recognize Folate-binding Protein,” Cancer Research, Vol. 51 (Nov. 15, 1991), at pp. 6125-31, report that folate-binding proteins are markers for ovarian cancer. Folate-receptor over-expression is also known for other cancers such as, for example, skin, renal, breast, lung, colon, nose, throat, mammary gland, and brain cancers, as well as other cancers referenced herein.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are useful and can be delivered as epothilone-derived microtubule-stabilizing agents to tumors that express a folate receptor. They are useful in the treatment of a variety of cancers and other proliferative diseases, particularly those cancers characterized by cancer cells or tumors that express the folate receptor.

A preferred range includes a dosage of about 0.02 to 5 mg/kg of body weight, with a range of about 0.05-0.3, being most preferred. It will be understood that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular subject can be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the species, age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the subject, the mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and severity of the particular condition. Preferred subjects for treatment include animals, most preferably mammalian species such as humans, and domestic animals such as dogs, cats and the like, subject to microtubule-stabilization associated conditions.\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention, such as compounds disclosed in one or more of the following examples, have been tested in one or more of the assays described below and/or assays known in the field, and demonstrate a measurable level of activity as microtubule stabilizing agents.\n\n\nAssays\n\n\nClonogenic Cell Survival Assay\n\n\nCancer cells were seeded at 3.0E+05 cells in a T75 flask with 10 ml of RPMI1640 media, free of folic acid, and containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 25 mM HEPES. Cells were grown in a 37° C. incubator containing 5% CO\n2 \nfor 2 days. On day 2, supernatants were removed from the flasks, and the flasks were divided into 2 groups. One group of cells were incubated with 5 ml of media containing 100 M of folic acid (Sigma) for 30 minutes and the others were grown in 5 ml of media without added folic acid. Cells were then treated with 20 nM of epothilone, epothilone analog, conjugated epothilone, or conjugated epothilone analog for one hour. At the end of the incubation, the drugs were removed from the flasks and the cells were washed with PBS buffer 3×. After washing, 5 ml of complete media were added into each flask, and the cell was grown in the CO\n2 \nincubator for 23 hours. The next morning, the cells were removed from the flasks by trypsinization, cell numbers were determined, and then cells were plated in a 6 well plates. Ten days after plating, colonies were stained with crystal violet and counted. The surviving fractions were determined.\n\n\nIn Vitro MTS Proliferation/Cytotoxicity Assay\n\n\nIn vitro cytotoxicity was assessed in tumor cells using a tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay which takes advantage of the metabolic conversion of MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulphenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt) to a reduced form that absorbs light at 492 nm. Cells were seeded 24 hr prior to addition of the epothilone, epothilone analog, conjugated epothilone, or conjugated epothilone analog. Following a 72 hour incubation at 37° C. with serially diluted compound, MTS, in combination with the electron coupling agent phenazine methosulfate, was added to the cells. The incubation was continued for 3 hours, then the absorbency of the medium at 492 nm was measured with a spectrophotometer to obtain the number of surviving cells relative to control populations. The results are expressed as median cytotoxic concentrations (IC\n50 \nvalues).\n\n\nFolate Receptor Assay\n\n\nAll sample preparation procedures used for the FR assay were performed at 4° C. Tissue samples were homogenized in homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.02 mg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin; 1 ml buffer/50 mg tissue) using a PowerGen 125 homogenizer. Large debris was removed by mild centrifugation (3000×g for 15 min). Membrane pellets were then collected by centrifugation at 40,000×g for 60 min and resuspended in solubilization buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.02% sodium azide). Insoluble material was removed by a second 40,000×g 60 min centrifugation, and the total protein concentration of the supernatants was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Pierce Chemical). Each sample was then diluted to 0.25 mg/ml in solubilization buffer, and 100 μl was placed inside each of two Microcon-30 microconcentrators (30,000-MW cutoff, Millipore). Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000×g for 10 min at room temperature to pass all of the liquid through the membrane, as well as to retain the solubilized FRs on the surface of the microconcentrator's membrane. All subsequent centrifugation steps were performed using these same parameters. Then 55 μl of 30 mM acetate buffer (pH 3.0) was added to each microconcentrator, followed by a centrifugation step. Next, 55 μl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was dispensed into each microconcentrator, followed by another centrifugation. Then 50 μl of [\n3\nH]folic acid binding reagent (120 nM [\n3\nH]folic acid (Amersham) in 10 mM Na\n2\nPO\n4\n, 1.8 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, pH 7.4, containing 500 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 25 mM n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside) or 50 μl of a competing reagent (binding reagent plus 120 μM unlabeled folic acid) was added to the appropriate concentrators. Following a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the concentrators were washed/centrifuged three times with 75 \nμl\n 50 mM n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, 0.7 M NaCl in PBS, pH 7.4. After the final wash, the retentates containing the solubilized FRs were recovered from the membrane surface of the microconcentrators by two rinses with 100 μl of PBS containing 4% Triton X-100. The samples were then counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Bioscience). Counts per minute (cpm) values were converted to picomoles of FR based on the cpm of a known standard, and the final results were normalized with respect to the sample protein content.\n\n\nAnimals and Tumors\n\n\nFemale CD2F1 mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley Inc., 20-22 g) maintained in a controlled environment and provided with water and food ad libitum were used in these studies. The murine FRα(−) Madison 109 (M109) lung carcinoma (Marks et al., 1977) and the FR-expressing (FRα(+)) 98M109 variant were used to evaluate the efficacy of the epothilone, epothilone analog (e.g., epothilone derivative), folate-epothilone conjugate, or folate-epothilone analog conjugate. In addition, the human head and neck epidermoid carcinoma KB grown in nude mice was also used for this purpose.\n\n\nDrug Treatment and Antitumor Efficacy Evaluation\n\n\nFor administration of epothilone or epothilone analogs to mice, an excipient consisting of the following was used: CREMOPHOR®/ethanol/water (1:1:8, v/v). The compounds were first dissolved in a mixture of CREMOPHOR®/ethanol (50:50). Final dilution to the required dosage strength was made less than 1 hr before drug administration. Mice were administered the agents by bolus IV injection through the tail vein. Folate-epothilone conjugates or folate-epothilone analog conjugates were prepared in sterile phosphate buffered saline and administered to mice by IV bolus injection through the tail vein at a volume of 0.01 mL/g of mice. Treatment of each animal was based on individual body weight.\n\n\nThe required number of animals needed to detect a meaningful response were pooled at the start of the experiment and each was given a subcutaneous inoculation of a tumor brei (2% w/v). Tumors were allowed to grow for 4 days. On the fourth day, animals were evenly distributed to various treatment and control groups. Treated animals were checked daily for treatment related toxicity/mortality. Each group of animals was weighed before the initiation of treatment (Wt1) and then again following the last treatment dose (Wt2). The difference in body weight (Wt2−Wt1) provides a measure of treatment-related toxicity.\n\n\nTumor response was determined by measurement of tumors with a caliper twice a week, until the tumors reached a predetermined “target” size of 1 gm. Tumor weights (mg) were estimated from the formula:\n\n\nTumor weight=(length×width\n2\n)÷2\n\n\n\nAntitumor activity was evaluated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which is defined as the dose level immediately below which excessive toxicity (i.e. more than one death) occurred. When death occurred, the day of death was recorded. Treated mice dying prior to having their tumors reach target size were considered to have died from drug toxicity. No control mice died bearing tumors less than target size. Treatment groups with more than one death caused by drug toxicity were considered to have had excessively toxic treatments and their data were not included in the evaluation of a compound's antitumor efficacy.\n\n\nTumor response end-point was expressed in terms of tumor growth delay (T-C value), defined as the difference in time (days) required for the treated tumors (T) to reach a predetermined target size compared to those of the control group (C).\n\n\nTo estimate tumor cell kill, the tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) was first calculated with the formula:\n\n\nTVDT=Median time (days) for control tumors to reach target size−Median time (days) for control tumors to reach half the target size\n\n\nAnd,\n\n\nLog cell kill=\nT\n-\nC\n÷(3.32\n×TVDT\n)\n\n\nStatistical evaluations of data were performed using Gehan's generalized Wilcoxon test.\n\n\n\nABBREVIATIONS\n\n\nThe following abbreviations are used in the schemes and Examples herein for ease of reference:\n\n \n \nCBZ-OSu=N-(Benzyloxycarbonyloxy)succinimide\n \nDCM=dichloromethane\n \nDEA=diethylamine\n \nDIAD=diisopropyl azodicarboxylate\n \nDIPEA=diisopropylethylamine\n \nDMA=dimethylamine\n \nDMF=dimethyl formamide\n \nDMSO=dimethylsufoxide\n \nEDC=1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride\n \nEtOH=ethanol\n \nEtOAc=ethyl acetate\n \nFR=folate receptor\n \nHOBt=n-hydroxy benzotriazole\n \nHPCL=high performance liquid chromatography\n \niPr—OH or IPA=isopropyl alcohol\n \nLC/MS=liquid chromatography/mass spec\n \nLDA=lithium diisopropylamide\n \nMeOH=methanol\n \nOTES=o-triethylsilyl;\n \nOMs=mesylate;\n \nPh=phenyl\n \nPd/C=palladium on carbon\n \nPyBOP=benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate\n \nPy=pyridyl\n \nRT=room temperature\n \nSat'd=saturated\n \nTHF=tetrahydrofuran\n \nTFA=trifluoroacetic acid\n \nTLC=thin layer chromatography\n \nTESCL=chlorotriethylsilane\n \nUV=ultraviolet.\n \n\n\nMethods of Preparation\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention may generally be prepared according to the following schemes and the knowledge of one skilled in the art, and/or using methods set forth in U.S. Pat.

Pub. 2006/004065, and Johnson et al. \nOrganic Letters, \n2000, 2:1537-1540) the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). For example a compound of formula II where R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, and R\n12 \nare methyl, B\n1 \nis hydroxyl, R\n1 \nand R\n6 \nare hydrogen, and R\n2 \nis 2-methylthiazol-4-yl is referred to as epothilone A and can be obtained from fermentation of \nSorangium cellulosum \nas referenced above. A compound of formula II can be converted to a compound of formula III where P is a silyl protecting group such as triethylsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl, triisopropylsilyl, and the like (see, e.g., Greene et al., “Protective groups in Organic Synthesis”, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.). For example, a compound of formula III where P is triethylsilyl can be prepared by treatment of a compound of formula II with chlorotriethylsilane in the presence of Hunig's base. In the case where B\n1 \nis hydroxyl in the compound of formula II, then B\n1 \nwould also be converted to the corresponding silyl ether. A halohydrin of formula IV (Y is Cl, Br, or I) can be prepared from a compound of formula III by treatment with a metal halide salt by methods known in the art. For example, epoxide opening using magnesium bromide etherate at low temperature (−20 to −5° C.) can provide diastereomeric halohydrins, where Y is bromine. A compound of formula V can be prepared from a compound of formula IV by displacement of the halogen using, for example, sodium azide in a polar solvent such as dimethylformamide. An ordinarily skilled artisan will recognize that the stereochemistry at C\n12 \nas depicted in Scheme I should not be construed as limiting, but rather exemplary. If desired, inversion of the stereochemistry at the C\n12 \nposition can be achieved following the Mitsunobu protocol which is well established in the art. For example, treatment of a compound of formula V with p-nitrobenzoic acid, diethylazodicarboxylate, and triphenylphosphine provides the corresponding nitrobenzoate ester, which can then be cleaved by mild ester hydrolysis using, for example, methanolic solutions of ammonia to provide a compound of formula VI. Again, the stereochemistry for C\n12 \nas depicted for compound VI is not limiting, and is depicted as such to show that treatment of compound V as described will invert the stereochemistry at that position. Alternatively, other organic acids, azodicarboxylates, and organophosphines can be used to effect the Mitsonuobu inversion. A compound of formula VII where OG is a leaving group such as mesylate, tosylate, nosylate, triflate and the like can be prepared from a compound of formula VI by methods known in the art. For example, treatment of VI with methanesulfonyl chloride and triethylamine in a suitable organic solvent such as dichloromethane provides a compound of formula VII where OG is mesylate. A compound of formula VIII can be prepared from a compound of formula VII by reduction of the azido group with a reducing agent such as an organophosphine (e.g., trimethylphosphine). Alternatively, a compound of formula VIII can be prepared directly from a compound of formula VI using an organophosphine reducing agent such as triphenylphosphine. A compound of formula IX can be prepared from a compound of formula VIII by methods known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,653; and Regueiro-Ren et al., \nOrganic Letters, \n2001, 3, 2693-2696). For instance, a compound of formula IX where H—K-A- is 2-hydroxyethyl can be prepared from a compound of formula VIII by alkylation of the aziridine ring using, for example, excess 2-bromoethanol and a base such as potassium carbonate. A compound of formula X can be prepared from a compound of formula IX by removal of the silyl ether protecting groups using methods known in the art (see, e.g., Greene et al., “Protective groups in Organic Synthesis”, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.). For instance, when P is triethylsilyl, treatment of a compound of formula IX with trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane effects deprotection to provide a compound of formula X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 2 shows a process for making a folate analog or derivative V and bivalent linker T-Q having the formula XI, below, that may be used with compounds of the invention to make conjugated molecules for targeted drug delivery, e.g., as per formula I, previously described. As shown in Scheme 2, a folate analog and bivalent linker can be assembled using methods known in the art, especially in the case where V is folic acid or a folic acid analog, as described, for example, by Jackson, et al., \nAdvanced Drug Delivery Rev. \n56 (2004) 1111-1125, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference, and T-Q is a peptide. For example, peptidyl folate XI can be prepared as shown in Scheme 2. Sequential peptide coupling of a cysteine-loaded polystyrene resin with Fmoc-protected aspartate, arginine, aspartate, and then glutamate can be effected using PyBOP as coupling agent and piperidine as Fmoc-deprotection agent. N\n10\n-Trifluoroacetamide-protected pteroic acid can be prepared in two steps by enzymatic (carboxypeptidase G) conversion of folic acid to pteroic acid, followed by N\n10\n-protection using trifluoroacetic anhydride. Next, coupling of the N\n10\n-protected pteroic acid to the resin-bound peptide followed by cleavage from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid and removal of the N\n10\n-trifluoroacetyl group using ammonium hydroxide provides a V-T-Q fragment of a compound of formula I where V is folic acid and T-Q is -Asp-Arg-Asp-Cys-OH. Alternatively, pteroic acid analogs could be used in place of pteroic acid and other amino acids, could be used in place of those illustrated in Scheme 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 3, below, shows a method for using the epothilone derivatives of the present invention to prepare a conjugated molecule of formula I, for use in targeted drug delivery. As shown in Scheme 3, assembly of compounds of formula I can be achieved by coupling compounds of formula X to a fragment V-T-Q by stepwise incorporation of a releasable linker M. By way of illustration, a compound of formula X where -A-K—H is —CH\n2\nCH\n2\nOH can be converted to a disulfanylethyl carbonate XIII using an activated benzotriazole compound of formula XII. A compound of formula XII can be prepared from mercaptoethanol, methoxycarbonyl sulfenyl chloride, and an optionally substituted 2-mercaptopyridine to provide an intermediate 2-(2-pyridin-2-yl) disulfanyl)ethanol, which can then be converted to a compound of formula XII by treatment with diphosgene and an optionally substituted 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Subsequent disulfide exchange with a peptidyl folate such as XI provides a compound of formula I where V is folic acid, T-Q is a -Asp-Arg-Asp-Cys-OH, M is —SCH\n2\nCH\n2\nO(C═O)—, A is —CH\n2\nCH\n2\n— and K is O,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 4 illustrates an alternative method for making a compound of formula X from a compound of formula XIV (see, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60/940,088, filed May 25, 2006, incorporated herein in its entirety by reference). Compounds of formula XIV can be obtained by methods well known in the field, for example, by fermentation (see, e.g. Gerth et al., “Studies on the Biosynthesis of Epothilones: The Biosynthetic Origin of the Carbon Skeleton,” Journal of Antibiotics, Vol. 53, No. 12 (December 2000), and Hofle et al., “Epothilone A and B-Novel 16-Membered Macrolides: Isolation, Crystal Structure, and Conformation in Solution”, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., Vol. 35, No. 13/14, 1567-1569 (1996), the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference) or by total synthesis (see, e.g. Vite et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,605,599; 6,242,469; 6,867,333 and US Pat. Appl. Pub. 2006/004065, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety). For example a compound of formula XIV where R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, and R\n12 \nare methyl, B\n1 \nis hydroxyl, R\n1 \nand R\n6 \nare hydrogen, and R\n2 \nis 2-methylthiazol-4-yl is referred to as epothilone C and can be obtained from fermentation of \nSorangium cellulosum \nas referenced above. A compound of formula XIV can be converted to a compound of formula XV where P is a silyl protecting group such as triethylsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl, triisopropylsilyl, and the like (see, e.g., Greene et al., “Protective groups in Organic Synthesis”, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.). For example, a compound of formula XV where P is triethylsilyl can be prepared by treatment of a compound of formula XIV with chlorotriethylsilane in the presence of base such as Hunig's base. In the case where B\n1 \nis hydroxyl in the compound of formula XIV, then B\n1 \nwould also be converted to the corresponding silyl ether. A halohydrin of formula XVI or XVII (Y is Cl, Br, or I) can be prepared from a compound of formula XV by treatment with a halogenating agent such as Y\n2\n. For example, electrophilic addition in polar solvents such as acetonitrile using iodine can stereoselectively provide regioisomeric halohydrins of formulas XVI and XVII, where Y is iodine. Alternatively N-halo succinimides can also be used for the same transformation. A compound of formula XVIII can be prepared from compounds of formulas XVI and/or XVII by epoxide ring closure in the presence of bases such as triethylamine or Hunig's base in a polar/aqueous solvent system such as acetonitrile/water. If desired, compound XIV can be directly transformed into a compounds of formula XVI and/or XVII (where P is H), which could then be converted into the epoxide XVIII (where P is H). A compound of formula XVIII can be transformed into the azido-alcohols of formulas VI and XIX by azide displacement in the presence of inorganic azide salts or tetra-alkyl ammonium azides in alcoholic solvents. In the case where P is a silyl protecting group, compounds of formulas XX and/or XXI where OG is a leaving group such as mesylate, tosylate, nosylate, triflate and the like can be prepared from compounds of formulas VI and/or XIX by methods known in the art. For example, treatment of VI and/or XIX with methanesulfonyl chloride and triethylamine in a suitable organic solvent such as dichloromethane provides compounds of formulas XX and XXI where OG is mesylate. A compound of formula VIII can be prepared from compounds of formulas XX and/or XXI by reduction of the azido group through methods known in the art. For example, compound VIII can be prepared from compounds of formulas XX and/or XXI through reaction with a reducing agent such as an organophosphine (e.g., trimethylphosphine) in polar solvents such as acetonitrile. Alternatively, when P is H, compound of formula VIII can be directly prepared from compounds of formulas VI and/or XIX by reduction of the azido group with a reducing agent such as an organophosphine (e.g., triphenylphosphine) in polar solvents such as acetonitrile. A compound of formula IX can be prepared from a compound of formula VIII by methods known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,800,653; and Regueiro-Ren et al., \nOrganic Letters, \n2001, 3, 2693-2696). For instance, a compound of formula IX where H—K-A- is 2-hydroxyethyl can be prepared from a compound of formula VIII by alkylation of the aziridine ring using, for example, excess 2-bromoethanol and a base such as potassium carbonate. In case P is a trialkylsilyl, a compound of formula X can be prepared from a compound of formula IX by removal of the silyl ether protecting groups using methods known in the art (see, e.g., Greene et al., “Protective groups in Organic Synthesis”, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.). For instance, when P is triethylsilyl, treatment of a compound of formula IX with trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane effects deprotection to provide a compound of formula X.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe invention will now be further described with reference to the following illustrative examples.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nFolate Conjugated Epothilone Analogs\n\n\nAs described in the detailed description above, analogs and derivatives of folate are described in Vlahov. In research and development directed toward folate receptor targeting to tumor cells of conjugated epothilone and epothilone analog compounds, several compounds were conjugated to folate. For example, Compound AA and Compound BB were considered as candidates for conjugation to folic acid:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound AA has activity in Phase II clinical trials, and six folate conjugates of Compound AA (Compounds AA.I to AA.VI; see \nFIG. 1\n) were prepared and optionally tested for chemical stability, FR binding, and FR-mediated activity in cell culture.\n\n\nThe binding of these folate conjugates of Compound AA to FR was determined in an assay that measures displacement of radiolabeled folic acid from FR expressed on KB tumor cells grown to confluence. Finding of the folate conjugates of Compounds AA.I and AA.II to FR was deemed acceptable [relative affinity (RA)>0.25; RA of folic acid=1.0]. However, surprisingly, none of the six conjugates of Compound AA shown in \nFIG. 1\n displayed appreciable cytotoxicity against KB tumor cells in antiproliferation assays that measure \n3\nH-thymidine incorporation (data not shown).\n\n\nSince conjugates of Compound AA demonstrated disappointing cytotoxicity against tumor cells, studies were conducted using three conjugates of Compound BB (Compounds BB.I to BB.III). Compound BB is also known as epothilone F, and is an analog of Compound AA, where the 21-amino group is replaced by a 21-hydroxyl group. While Compound BB.II (\nFIG. 2\n) displayed cytotoxicity at high concentrations, the activity was not attenuated in competition studies using excess of folic acid. Therefore, the observed cytotoxicity was attributed to non-specific release of Compound BB.II.\n\n\nOther epothilone analogs, e.g., aziridinyl epothilones, are known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,399,638; Regueiro-Ren, A, et al. (2001) \nOrg. Letters. \n3:2693-96) and show potent antitumor cytotoxicity. For example, an MTS assay that compared the relative cytotoxic potency of a number of epothilone analogs against a pair of taxane-resistant cancer cell lines (HCTVM46 and A2790Tax) was conducted (see Table 1). HCTVM46 is a human colon carcinoma cell line derived from the sensitive HCT116 parent line, and is resistant to taxanes due to overexpression of the 170 kD p-glyprotein drug efflux transporter. A2780Tax is a human ovarian carcinoma cell line derived from the parent A2780 line, and is resistant to paclitaxel as a result of a mutation in the tubulin amino acid sequence that impairs the ability of paclitaxel to bind.\n\n\nAs is shown in Table 1, various aziridinyl epothilone analogs (Compounds CC-EE) show potent antitumor activity against both the HCT116 colon and A2780 ovarian carcinoma cell lines, compared to other known antitumor agents, e.g., paclitaxel, compound AA, and epothilone B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn vitro activity of 12,13-aziridinyl epothilones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHCT116\n\n\nR/S\n\n\nA2780\n\n\nR/S\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCom-\n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50\n \n\n\nRa-\n\n\nIC\n5\n \n\n\nRa-\n\n\n\n\n\n\npound\n\n\nR\n\n\n(nM)\n1\n \n\n\ntio\n2\n \n\n\n(nM)\n1\n \n\n\ntio\n3\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCC\n\n\n—H\n\n\n4.2 ± 2.8\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n3.4 ± 1.5\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD\n\n\n—CH\n3\n \n\n\n0.37 ± 0.13\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.25 ± 0.06\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEE\n\n\n—CH\n2\nCH\n2\nOCH\n3\n \n\n\n0.40 ± 0.25\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n0.22 ± 0.12\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\npacli-\n\n\n—\n\n\n3.3 ± 1.0\n\n\n150   \n\n\n3.1 ± 1.0\n\n\n22.1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntaxel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAA\n\n\n—\n\n\n1.2 ± 0.3\n\n\n14.8 \n\n\n1.1 ± 0.4\n\n\n3  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpothil-\n\n\n—\n\n\n0.40 ± 0.13\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.23 ± 0.09\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\none B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n1\nMean IC\n50 \n± SD calculated from four separate experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n2\nR/S ratio = HCT116 IC\n50\n/HCT116VM46 IC\n50\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n3\nR/S ratio = A2780 IC\n50\n/A2780Tax IC\n50\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the antitumor activities of aziridinyl epothilone compounds CC-EE, the only hydroxyl groups on these molecules available for conjugation to folate are those found at the C\n3 \nand C\n7 \ncarbon atoms. Consequently, having researched a number of epothilone compounds and analogs, there remained a challenge to discover a compound that would be readily available for conjugation to folate, and which would demonstrate activity via specific release of the active epothilone moiety in the tumor cells.\n\n\nThe aziridinyl epothilone compound G was discovered, having the formula,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound G (see Examples 2 and 3) proved surprisingly easy to conjugate to folic acid to form Compound J (see Example 2) with relative affinity of 0.77 for folate receptor, when compared to folic acid.\n\n\nUnexpectedly, the polar hydroxyl group on the aziridine side chain did not adversely affect the antitumor activity of the aziridine epothilone analogs. This is important because it is the aziridine epothilone analog, e.g., Compound G, that mediates the antitumor effects upon release from folic acid. The potency of Compound G, and three other highly potent epothilone analogs (ixabepilone, Compound AA, and Compound BB) were evaluated by the colony formation assay that is described above. The concentration needed to kill 90% of clonogenic KB cancer cells (IC\n90\n) was determined after a drug exposure duration of 17 hours. As shown in \nFIG. 3\n, compound G exhibited an IC\n90 \nof 4.3 nM and was ˜2, 4, and 6-fold more potent than compound CC, compound AA, and ixabepilone, respectively.\n\n\nConjugation of compound G to form Compound J did not affect the antitumor activity of compound G. Compound J demonstrated substantial cytotoxic activity against tumor cells in vivo. In the KB in vivo FRα(+) tumor model, compound J demonstrated activity both at is maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and at two lower does levels that produced minimal toxicity (see \nFIG. 4\n). In contrast, ixabepilone was active only at its MTD (5 μmol/kg). When compared at the MTDs, compound J produced superior antitumor effects than ixabepilone (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, with the FRα(−) M109 parent tumor model, Compound J had poor activity at all dose levels tested, including at its MTD (2.4 μmol/kg), whereas ixabepilone was active at its MTD of 5 μmol/kg. (\nFIG. 5\n). These results indicate that the FRα(−) M109 is sensitive to ixabepilone and the inactivity of compound J is likely largely a consequence of the absence of FRα expression by this tumor. These results also provide evidence that the antitumor activity of compound J may be mediated through the FRα receptors.\n\n\nFurther evidence of the FRα mediated drug delivery mechanism of compound J is provided by the observation that co-administration of a folate analog at 20-fold excess of the dose of compound J could substantially compete with compound J for receptor binding and protect FRα(+) 98M109 tumors from the antitumor effects of compound J. (\nFIG. 6\n). Since Compound G and the conjugate (Compound J) have surprising anti-tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo, and since the antitumor activities of Compound J may be attributed to FRα(+)-mediated effects, also described herein is the conjugation of aziridinyl epothilone analog Compound G (see Examples 2 and 3) to form Compound J. (See Example 2).\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nPreparation of Compound J\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(S)-2-(4-((2-amino-4-oxo-3,4-dihydropteridin-6-yl)methylamino)benzamido)-5-((S)-3-carboxy-1-((S)-1-((S)-3-carboxy-1-((R)-1-carboxy-2-(2-(2-((2-((1S,3S,7S,10R,11S, 12S, 16R)-7,11-dihydroxy-8,8,10,12-tetramethyl-3-((E)-1-(2-methylthiazol-4-yl)prop-1-en-2-yl)-5,9-dioxo-4-oxa-17-aza-bicyclo[14.1.0]heptadecan-17-yl)ethoxy)carbonyloxy)ethyl)disulfanyl)ethylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-ylamino)-5-guanidino-1-oxopentan-2-ylamino)-1-oxopropan-2-ylamino)-5-oxopentanoic acid\n\n\nA.

The mixture was bubbled for 1 hr and washed 3× with DMF and isopropyl alcohol. FMOC deprotection was effected by treatment with 20% piperidine in DMF, 2× (10 min), before each amino acid coupling. This sequence was repeated for each amino acid coupling step.\n\n\nSynthesis of N\n10\n-TFA-protected pteroic acid:\n\n\nTo 10 L of 0.1 M tris base solution (121.1 g tris base in 10 L water) in a 22 L mechanically-stirred round bottomed flask, equipped with a heating mantle, was added 200 g (0.453 mole) of folic acid. The mixture was stirred to dissolve the folic acid, and then 500 mg (3.67 mmole) zinc chloride was added. Carboxypeptidase G (13×20 unit vials available from Sigma) was added and the pH was adjusted to 7.3 with 1N HCl and maintained throughout the reaction. The mixture was protected from light and heated at 30° C. for 8-10 days (use of an auto-titrator to hold the pH constant reduced the conversion time by 4-5 days). The reaction was monitored by analytical HPLC until 80% conversion was achieved (further conversion is desirable but has not been optimized). The product was precipitated from the reaction mixture by adjusting the solution to pH=3.0 using 6N HCl. The slurry was transferred to a centrifuge vial and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted. The wet solid was then directly purified as follows (the wet solid could be frozen for storage or first freeze-dried; however, storage of wet solids in the freezer until dissolution was more efficient). To 40 g of crude pteroic acid in 700 mL of water was added 1.0 M NaOH until pH=11.5. The mixture was filtered (Whatman type 1) and then chromatographed (column: 10×120 cm; stationary phase: 8 kg DEAE cellulose; mobile phase: 1.0 M NaCl/0.01 M NaOH, pH=11.5; flow rate: 17 ml/min). One liter yellow-colored fractions were collected and analyzed by HPLC. Fractions containing pure pteroic acid were adjusted to pH=3 with 6 M HCl to precipitate pteroic acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was decanted and washed with water (3×). The solid was freeze-dried for at least 72 hr. The impact of residual water on the next reaction is not known.\n\n\nThe pteroic acid was further dried over P\n2\nO\n5 \nunder high vacuum for over 24 hr (note that similar results in the protection step were obtained without this additional drying step). Next, 100 g (0.32 mol) of pteroic acid was added to a 5 L round bottom flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer and an argon inlet, and stored under high vacuum overnight. Argon gas was added followed by 3500 g (2316 mL) of trifluoroacetic anhydride. The flask was sealed with a rubber stopper or argon inlet adaptor, and then stirred vigorously. The flask was protected from light and stirred at room temperature under argon atmosphere for 7 days (the reaction was monitored by HPLC of aliquots diluted 20× each with water and DMSO). The mixture was rotary evaporated to dryness and treated with 2.5 L of 3% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature to hydrolyze anhydride by-products. Rotary evaporation gave a dry solid. The solid was suspended in 2 L of water and then centrifuged in 250-mL centrifuge bottles at 3000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was removed and the solid was washed with water and centrifuged (4 times). The solid was freeze-dried for 3 days, transferred to amber bottles, and dried under high vacuum in the presence of P\n2\nO\n5 \nfor 2 days (Purity≧95%; residual TFA assessed by Elemental Analysis).\n\n\nCleavage step:\n\n\nThe protected intermediate was released from the resin using the cleavage reagent prepared from 92.5% (50 mL) TFA, 2.5% (1.34 mL) H\n2\nO, 2.5% (1.34 mL) Triisopropylsilane, and 2.5% (1.34 mL) ethanedithiol. The cleavage reagent was added to the reaction vessel (25 mL). Argon was bubbled through the mixture for 1.5 hr. The liquid was drained from the vessel, and resin was washed with remaining reagent (3×8 mL). The volatiles were concentrated by rotary evaporation to a volume of 10 mL. Diethyl ether (35.0 mL) was added to effect precipitation. The solid was collected by centrifugation and dried to give 1.25 g of cleavage product.\n\n\nDeprotection Step:\n\n\nThe N\n10\n-trifluoroacetyl protecting group in the pteroic acid portion was removed under basic conditions. Starting with 250 mg of protected intermediate in 10 mL water, the pH was adjusted to 9.3 and maintained for 1 hr using 4:1H\n2\nO:ammonium hydroxide (1-2 mL). After 1 hr, the pH was adjusted to 5 with 1N HCl (˜1 mL) and the product was purified on preparative HPLC to yield 125 mg of Compound H.\n\n\nHPLC Purification Conditions:\n\n\nColumn: Waters NovaPak C\n18 \n300×9 mm\n\n\nSolvent A: \nBuffer\n 10 mM Ammonium Acetate, pH=5\n\n\nSolvent B: Acetonitrile\n\n\nElution: 1% B to 20% B in 40 min at 15 mL/min\n\n\nTotal yield from combined reactions: 625 mg\n\n\nI.

The mixture was added dropwise over a period of 20 min. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to RT and stirred for an additional 1 hr.
