Description\n\n\n\n\n SUBSTITUTED-OUINOXALINE-TYPE BRIDGED-PIPERIDBVE COMPOUNDS AND THE USES THEREOF\n\n\n1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds, compositions comprising an effective amount of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged- Piperidine Compound and methods to treat or prevent a condition, such as pain, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound.\n\n\n2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nChronic pain is a major contributor to disability and is the cause of much suffering. The successful treatment of severe and chronic pain is a primary goal of the physician, with opioid analgesics being preferred drugs for doing so.\n\n\nUntil recently, there was evidence of three major classes of opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), with each class having subtype receptors. These receptor classes are known as μ, K and δ. As opiates have a high affinity for these receptors while not being endogenous to the body, research followed in order to identify and isolate the endogenous ligands to these receptors. These ligands were identified as enkephalins, endorphins and dynorphins.\n\n\nRecent experimentation has led to the identification of a cDNA encoding an opioid receptor-like (ORL-I) receptor with a high degree of homology to the known receptor classes. The ORL-I receptor was classified as an opioid receptor based only on structural grounds, as the receptor did not exhibit pharmacological homology. It was initially demonstrated that nonselective ligands having a high affinity for μ, K and δ receptors had low affinity for the ORL-I receptor. This characteristic, along with the fact that an endogenous ligand had not yet been discovered, led to the term \"orphan receptor\".\n\n\nSubsequent research led to the isolation and structure of the endogenous ligand of the ORL- 1 receptor (i.e., nociceptin). This ligand is a seventeen amino acid peptide structurally similar to members of the opioid peptide family.\n\n\nThe discovery of the ORL-I receptor presents an opportunity in drug discovery for novel compounds that can be administered for pain management or other syndromes modulated by this receptor.\n\n\nInternational PCT Publication No. WO 99/46260 Al describes quinoxalinone derivatives as inhibitors of protein kinase C. \n\n International PCT Publication No. WO 99/50254 Al describes quinoxalinone derivatives as serine protease inhibitors.\n\n\nInternational PCT Publication No. WO 01/90102 A2 describes 6-heterocyclyl-3-oxo-3,4- dihydro-quinoxalines for use as herbicides. International PCT Publication No. WO 2003/062234 Al describes quinoxaline derivatives for use in remedying diseases in which poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) participates.\n\n\nU.S. published patent application No. US 2005/0256000 by Schaper et al. describes quinoxaline-2-one derivatives for use as safeners for plants.\n\n\nInternational PCT Publication No. WO 2005/028451 Al describes tetrahydroquinoxaline derivatives for use as M2 acetylcholine receptor agonists.\n\n\nInternational PCT Publication No. WO 2009/027820 A2 describes substituted-quinoxaline- type piperidine compounds for use in treating or preventing, e.g. , pain.\n\n\nCitation of any reference in Section 2 of this application is not to be construed as an admission that such reference is prior art to the present application.\n\n\n3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIt is an object of the invention to provide new compounds that exhibit affinity for the ORL- 1 receptor.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments of the invention, such new compounds exhibit agonist activity at the ORL-I receptor. In certain embodiments of the invention, such new compounds exhibit partial agonist activity at the ORL-I receptor.\n\n\nIn certain other embodiments of the invention, such new compounds exhibit antagonist activity at the ORL-I receptor.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments of the invention, such new compounds exhibit affinity for the ORL-I receptor, and also for one or more of the μ, K or δ receptors. In a particular embodiment, a new compound of the invention exhibits affinity for both the ORL-I receptor and the μ receptor. In another embodiment, a new compound of the invention acts as an ORL-I receptor agonist and as a μ receptor agonist. In another embodiment, a new compound of the invention acts as an ORL-I receptor partial agonist and as a μ receptor agonist. In another embodiment, a new compound of the invention acts as an ORL-I receptor partial agonist and as a μ receptor antagonist, hi another embodiment, a new compound of the invention acts as an ORL-I receptor antagonist and as a μ receptor agonist.\n\n\n- I r \n\n Certain new compounds of the invention can be used to treat an animal suffering from chronic or acute pain.\n\n\nIt is a further object of the invention to provide methods of treating chronic or acute pain in an animal by administering one or more Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds of the invention to an animal in need of such treatment. In certain embodiments, such new Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds effectively treat chronic or acute pain in the animal, while producing fewer or reduced side effects compared to previously available compounds. For example, Substituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds 358, 361, and 362 have surprisingly and desirably reduced abnormal behavioral side effects, such as reduced sedation, hyperactivity and/or hypoactivity. Additionally and surprisingly, Substituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound 362 has reduced cardiovascular side effects. These side effects were determined using known methods: an in vitro hERG (human ether a-go-go gene) assay as disclosed in Z.

In general, such prodrugs will be a functional derivative of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound of Formula (I), Formula (F) or Formula (II) which is readily convertible in vivo, e.g., by being metabolized, into the required Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound of Formula (I), Formula (F) or Formula (IF). Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described in, for example, Design of Prodrugs, H. Bundgaard ed., Elsevier (1985); \"Drug and Enzyme Targeting, Part A,\" K. Widder et al. eds., Vol. 112 in Methods in\n\n\nEnzymology, Academic Press (1985); Bundgaard, \"Design and Application of Prodrugs,\" Chapter 5 (pp. 113-191) in A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, P. Krogsgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard eds., Harwood Academic Publishers (1991); Bundgaard et al., Adv. Drug Delivery Revs. 8:1-38 (1992); Bundgaard et al., J. Pharmaceut. ScL 77:285 (1988); and Kakeya et al, Chem. Pharm. Bull. 32:692 (1984).\n\n\nIn addition, one or more hydrogen, carbon or other atoms of a Substituted-Quinoxaline- Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound can be replaced by an isotope of the hydrogen, carbon or other atoms. Such a \"radiolabeled\", \"radiolabeled form\", and the like of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound, each of which is encompassed by the invention, is useful as a research and/or diagnostic tool in metabolism pharmacokinetic studies and in binding assays. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged- \n\n Piperidine Compound of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\n0, \n17\n0, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, and \n36\nCl, respectively. Radiolabeled compounds of the invention can be prepared by methods known in the art. For example, tritiated compounds of Formula I can be prepared by introducing tritium into the particular compound of Formula I, for example, by catalytic dehalogenation with tritium. This method can include reacting a suitably halogen-substituted precursor of a compound of Formula (I), Formula (F) or Formula (II) with tritium gas in the presence of a suitable catalyst, for example, Pd/C, in the presence or absence of a base. Other suitable methods for preparing tritiated compounds can be found in Filer, Isotopes in the Physical and Biomedical Sciences, Vol. 1, Labeled Compounds (Part A), Chapter 6 (1987). \n14\nC-labeled compounds can be prepared by employing starting materials having a \n14\nC carbon.\n\n\nA Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound can contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms.

Compounds that modulate the receptor activity include agonists, partial agonists, antagonists, mixed agonists/antagonists, mixed partial agonists/antagonists and compounds which directly or indirectly affect regulation of the receptor activity.\n\n\nAs used herein, a compound that binds to a receptor and mimics the regulatory effect(s) of an endogenous ligand is defined as an \"agonist\". As used herein, a compound that binds to a receptor and is only partly effective as an agonist is defined as a \"partial agonist\".

Compound O4 can be converted to the exemplary Substituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound 362 using a base, such as NaOH or KOH, in water and a solvent, such as MeOH, EtOH or THF.\n\n\nAlternatively, compound O3 can be prepared from compound O2 in a four step procedure as follows. Compound O2 can be reacted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in a base, such as an inorganic base, e.g., sodium acetate, or an organic base, e.g., pyridine, in a solvent, such as EtOH, to provide oxime compound O5. Compound O5 can be reduced to the endo amine isomer compound O6 in good stereoselectivity by using a catalyst, such as a platinum group metal catalyst, e.g., platinum oxide or palladium on charcoal, in a solvent, such as acetic acid, under an atmosphere of from about latm to about 5atm of hydrogen.

Compound O7 can be converted to compound O3 under hydrogenation conditions using a catalyst, such as Raney nickel, palladium on charcoal or platinum oxide, in a solvent, such as MeOH or EtOH.\n\n\nScheme P\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, as shown in Scheme P an exemplary Substituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged- Piperidine Compound comprising an R\n1\n group formed from compound Nl can be prepared by a method beginning with a two-step, \"one-pot\" procedure for converting compound O2 to compound O3. For purposes of exemplification only, while the product illustrated in Scheme P is Substituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound 362, as those in the art will recognize this \n\n scheme is of course non-limiting and applicable to the preparation of other Substituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds. Compound O2 can be reacted with an excess of 1,2-phenylenediamine, from 1.2 to 3.0 equivalents, and acetic acid in a solvent, such as THF or DME (diglyme), and the intermediate imine (comprising a C=N group) can immediately be reacted with a reducing agent, such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride, to provide compound O3.\n\n\nCompound O3 can be converted to compound O4 by reaction with diethyl 2-oxomalonate and formic acid in a solvent, such as toluene or xylene, at a temperature of from about 8O\n0\nC to about 11O\n0\nC. Compound O4 can be converted to the exemplary Substituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged- Piperidine Compound by reaction with a base, such as NaOH or KOH, in water and a co-solvent, such as THF or DME. After the reaction is complete, excess TsOH in THF can be added to provide the tosylate salt of the exemplary Substituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound 362.\n\n\n4.6 Therapeutic Uses of the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds\n\n\nIn accordance with the invention, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds are administered to an animal in need of treatment or prevention of a Condition.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, an effective amount of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged- Piperidine Compound can be used to treat or prevent any condition treatable or preventable by inhibiting the activity of the ORL-I receptor.

For example, a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound can be used to treat or prevent pain associated with inflammatory diseases including, but not limited to, organ transplant rejection; reoxygenation injury resulting from organ transplantation (see Grupp et al., J. MoI, Cell Cardiol. 31:297-303 (1999)) including, but not limited to, transplantation of the heart, lung, liver, or kidney; chronic inflammatory diseases of the joints, including arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and bone diseases associated with increased bone resorption; inflammatory bowel diseases, such as ileitis, ulcerative colitis, Barrett's syndrome, and Crohn's disease; inflammatory lung diseases, such as asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and chronic obstructive airway disease; inflammatory diseases of the eye, including corneal dystrophy, trachoma, onchocerciasis, uveitis, sympathetic ophthalmitis and endophthalmitis; chronic inflammatory disease of the gum, including gingivitis and periodontitis; tuberculosis; leprosy; inflammatory diseases of the kidney, including uremic complications, glomerulonephritis and nephrosis; inflammatory disease of the skin, including sclerodermatitis, psoriasis and eczema; inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system, including chronic demyelinating diseases of the nervous system, multiple sclerosis, AIDS-related neurodegeneration and Alzheimer 's disease, infectious meningitis, encephalomyelitis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and viral or autoimmune encephalitis; autoimmune diseases, including Type I and Type II diabetes mellitus; diabetic complications, including, but not limited to, diabetic cataract, glaucoma, retinopathy, nephropathy (such as microaluminuria and progressive diabetic nephropathy), gangrene of the feet, atherosclerotic coronary arterial disease, peripheral arterial disease, nonketotic hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar coma, foot ulcers, joint problems, and a skin or mucous membrane complication (such as an infection, a shin spot, a candidal infection or necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum), immune-complex vasculitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); inflammatory disease of the heart, such as cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease hypercholesterolemia, and artherosclerosis; as well as various other diseases that can have significant inflammatory components, including preeclampsia, chronic liver failure, brain and spinal cord trauma, and cancer. A Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound can also be used to treat or prevent pain associated with inflammatory disease that can, for example, be a systemic inflammation of the body, exemplified by gram-positive or gram negative shock, hemorrhagic or anaphylactic shock, or shock induced by cancer chemotherapy in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., shock associated with proinflammatory cytokines. Such shock can be induced, e.g., by a chemotherapeutic agent that is administered as a treatment for cancer. The Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds can also be used to treat or prevent pain associated with nerve injury {i.e., neuropathic pain). Chronic neuropathic pain \n\n is a heterogenous disease state with an unclear etiology. In chronic neuropathic pain, the pain can be mediated by multiple mechanisms. This type of pain generally arises from injury to the peripheral or central nervous tissue. The syndromes include pain associated with spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, phantom pain, causalgia, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy and lower back pain. The chronic pain is different from acute pain in that chronic neuropathic pain patients suffer the abnormal pain sensations that can be described as spontaneous pain, continuous superficial burning and/or deep aching pain. The pain can be evoked by heat-, cold-, and mechano-hyperalgesia, or by heat-, cold-, or mechano-allodynia.\n\n\nChronic neuropathic pain can be caused by injury or infection of peripheral sensory nerves. It includes, but is not limited to, pain from peripheral nerve trauma, herpes virus infection, diabetes mellitus, causalgia, plexus avulsion, neuroma, limb amputation, and vasculitis. Neuropathic pain can also be caused by nerve damage from chronic alcoholism, human immunodeficiency virus infection, hypothyroidism, uremia, or vitamin deficiencies. Stroke (spinal or brain) and spinal cord injury can also induce neuropathic pain. Cancer-related neuropathic pain results from tumor growth compression of adjacent nerves, brain, or spinal cord. In addition, cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can cause nerve injury. Neuropathic pain includes but is not limited to pain caused by nerve injury such as, for example, the pain from which diabetics suffer.\n\n\nThe Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds can be used to treat or prevent a migraine including, but not limited to, migraine without aura (\"common migraine\"), migraine with aura (\"classic migraine\"), migraine without headache, basilar migraine, familial hemiplegic migraine, migrainous infarction, and migraine with prolonged aura.\n\n\nAccording to the invention, some of the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds are agonists at the ORL-I receptor, some of the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds are partial agonists at the ORL-I receptor, and some of the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds are antagonists at the ORL-I receptor. In another embodiment, a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound is an agonist at the ORL-I receptor and an agonist at a μ, K and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a μ opioid receptor. In another embodiment, a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound is a partial agonist at the ORL-I receptor and an agonist at a μ, K and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a μ opioid receptor. In another embodiment, a Substituted-Quinoxaline- Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound is an antagonist at the ORL-I receptor and an agonist at a μ, K and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a μ opioid receptor. In another embodiment, a Substituted- Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound is an agonist at the ORL-I receptor and an antagonist at a μ, K and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a μ opioid receptor. In another embodiment, a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound is a partial agonist at \n\n the ORL-I receptor and an antagonist at a μ, K and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a μ opioid receptor. In another embodiment, a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound is an antagonist at the ORL-I receptor and an antagonist at a μ, K and/or δ opioid receptor, particularly at a μ opioid receptor. The invention also provides methods for inhibiting ORL-I receptor function in a cell, comprising contacting a cell capable of expressing the ORL-I receptor with an amount of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound effective to inhibit ORL-I receptor function in the cell. This method can be adapted for use in vitro as part of an assay to select compounds that can be useful for treating or preventing a Condition in an animal. Alternatively, this method can be adapted for use in vivo, (i.e., in an animal such as a human) by contacting a cell in the animal with an effective amount of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound. In one embodiment, the method is useful for treating or preventing pain in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention. In another embodiment, the method is useful for treating or preventing a memory disorder, obesity, constipation, depression, dementia, or Parkinsonism in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention.\n\n\nThe invention also relates to methods for activating ORL-I receptor function in a cell, comprising contacting a cell capable of expressing the ORL-I receptor with an amount of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound effective to activate ORL-I receptor function in the cell. This method can be adapted for use in vitro as part of an assay to select compounds useful for treating or preventing, pain, anxiety, cough, diarrhea, high blood pressure, epilepsy, anorexia/cachexia, urinary incontinence, or drug abuse. Alternatively, the method can be adapted for use in vivo (i.e., in an animal such as a human), by contacting a cell in the animal with an effective amount of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound. In one embodiment the method is useful for treating or preventing pain in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention. In another embodiment, the method is useful for treating or preventing anxiety, cough, diarrhea, high blood pressure, epilepsy, anorexia/chachexia, urinary incontinence, or drug abuse in an animal in need of such treatment or prevention.\n\n\nExamples of tissue comprising cells capable of expressing the ORL-I receptor include but are not limited to brain, spinal cord, vas deferens, and gastrointestinal tract tissue. Methods for assaying cells that express the ORL-I receptor are known in the art; for example, see Y.\n\n\nShimohigashi et al., \"Sensitivity of opioid receptor-like receptor ORLl for chemical modification on nociceptin, a naturally occurring nociceptive peptide,\" J. Biol. Chem. 27U39):23642-23645 (1996); M. Narita et al., \"Identification of the G-protein coupled ORLl receptor in the mouse spinal cord by [\n35\nS]-GTPyS binding and immunohistochemistry,\" Brit. J. Pharmacol. 128:1300-1306 (1999); G. Milligan, \"Principles: Extending then utility of [\n35\nS]GTPyS binding assays,\" TIPS \n\n 14:110-112 (2003): and S. Lazareno, \"Measurement of agonist-stimulated [\n35\nS]GTPγS binding to cell membranes,\" Methods in Molecular Biology Vol. 106:231245 (1999).\n\n\n4.7 Therapeutic/Prophylactic Administration and Compositions of the Invention\n\n\nDue to their activity, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds are advantageously useful in human and veterinary medicine. As described above, the Substituted- Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds are useful for treating or preventing a Condition in an animal in need thereof. The Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds of the invention can be administered to any animal requiring modulation of the opioid and/or ORL-I receptors. When administered to an animal, a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine\n\n\nCompound can be administered as a component of a composition that comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The invention compositions, which comprise a Substituted- Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound, can be administered orally. A Substituted- Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound can also be administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings (e.g., oral, rectal, and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and can be administered together with a second therapeutically active agent. Administration can be systemic or local. Various delivery systems are known, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, multiparticulates, capsules, etc., and can be used to administer a Substituted- Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound.\n\n\nMethods of administration include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, parenteral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectal, by inhalation, or topical, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The method of administration is left to the discretion of the practitioner, hi most instances, administration will result in the release of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged- Piperidine Compound into the bloodstream. hi specific embodiments, it can be desirable to administer a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound locally. This can be achieved, for example and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during surgery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository or enema, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, it can be desirable to introduce a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound into the central nervous system or gastrointestinal tract by any \n\n suitable route, including intraventricular, intrathecal, and epidural injection, and enema. Intraventricular injection can be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir.\n\n\nPulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosolizing agent, or via perfusion in a fluorocarbon or synthetic pulmonary surfactant. In certain embodiments, a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and excipients such as triglycerides.\n\n\nWhen a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound of the invention is incorporated for parenteral administration by injection (e.g., continuous infusion or bolus injection), the formulation for parenteral administration can be in the form of a suspension, solution, emulsion in an oily or aqueous vehicle, and such formulations can further comprise pharmaceutically necessary additives such as one or more stabilizing agents, suspending agents, dispersing agents, and the like. A Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound of the invention can also be in the form of a powder for reconstitution as an injectable formulation.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990); and Treat et al, Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer 317-327 and 353-365 (1989)). In yet another embodiment, a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound can be delivered in a controlled-re lease system or sustained-release system (see, e.g., Goodson, \"Dental Applications\" (pp. 115-138) in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, Vol. 2, Applications and Evaluation, R.S. Langer and D.L. Wise eds., CRC Press (1984)). Other controlled- or sustained-release systems discussed in the review by Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990) can be used. In one embodiment, a pump can be used (Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990); Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al, Surgery 88:507 (1980); and Saudek et al, N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release (Langer and Wise eds., 1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance (Smolen and Ball eds., 1984); Ranger and Peppas, J. Macromol ScI Rev. Macromol Chem. 23:61 (1983); Levy et al, Science 228: 190 (1985); During et al, Ann. Neurol. 25:351 (1989); and Howard et al, J. Neurosurg. 71:105 (1989)). hi yet another embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release system can be placed in proximity of a target of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged- Piperidine Compound, e.g., the spinal column, brain, or gastrointestinal tract, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose. \n\n The invention compositions can optionally comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient so as to provide the form for proper administration to the animal. Such a pharmaceutical excipient can be a diluent, suspending agent, solubilizer, binder, disintegrant, preservative, coloring agent, lubricant, and the like. The pharmaceutical excipient can be a liquid, such as water or an oil, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. The pharmaceutical excipient can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating, and coloring agents can be used. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is sterile when administered to an animal. Water is a particularly useful excipient when a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged- Piperidine Compound is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid excipients, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients also include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The invention compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. Specific examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients that can be used to formulate oral dosage forms are described in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, American Pharmaceutical Association (1986). The invention compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the composition is in the form of a capsule {see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical excipients are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., 19th ed. 1995), incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a composition adapted for oral administration to human beings. A Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound to be orally delivered can be in the form of tablets, capsules, gelcaps, caplets, lozenges, aqueous or oily solutions, suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, for example. When a\n\n\nSubstituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound is incorporated into oral tablets, such tablets can be compressed, tablet triturates, enteric-coated, sugar-coated, film-coated, multiply compressed or multiply layered. Techniques and compositions for making solid oral dosage forms are described in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets (Lieberman, Lachman and Schwartz, eds., 2nd ed.) published by Marcel Dekker, Inc. Techniques and compositions for making tablets (compressed and molded), capsules (hard and soft gelatin) and pills are also described in \n\n Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1553-1593 (Arthur Osol, ed., 16\nth\n ed., Mack Publishing, Easton, PA 1980).\n\n\nLiquid oral dosage forms include aqueous and nonaqueous solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and solutions and/or suspensions reconstituted from non-effervescent granules, optionally containing one or more suitable solvents, preservatives, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, diluents, sweeteners, coloring agents, flavoring agents, and the like. Techniques and composition for making liquid oral dosage forms are described in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems, (Lieberman, Rieger and Banker, eds.) published by Marcel Dekker, Inc.\n\n\nWhen a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound is to be injected parenterally, it can be, e.g., in the form of an isotonic sterile solution. Alternatively, when a\n\n\nSubstituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound is to be inhaled, it can be formulated into a dry aerosol or can be formulated into an aqueous or partially aqueous solution.\n\n\nAn orally administered Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound can contain one or more agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In these latter platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time- delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate can also be used. Oral compositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate, hi one embodiment, the excipients are of pharmaceutical grade.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds can be formulated for intravenous administration. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration comprise sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions can also include a solubilizing agent. A Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound for intravenous administration can optionally include a local anesthetic such as benzocaine or prilocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampule or sachette indicating the \n\n quantity of active agent. Where a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged- Piperidine Compound is administered by injection, an ampule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.\n\n\nA Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound can be administered by controlled-release or sustained-release means or by delivery devices that are known to those in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent Nos.: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; and 5,733,566, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide controlled- or sustained-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, multiparticulates, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled- or sustained-release formulations known to those in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active ingredients of the invention. The invention thus encompasses single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled- or sustained-release. Controlled- or sustained-release pharmaceutical compositions can have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled or non-sustained-release counterparts. In one embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release composition comprises a minimal amount of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound to treat or prevent the Condition or a symptom thereof in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled- or sustained-release compositions include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased compliance. In addition, controlled- or sustained-release compositions can favorably affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound, and can thus reduce the occurrence of adverse side effects. Controlled- or sustained-release compositions can initially release an amount of a\n\n\nSubstituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound that promptly produces the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, and gradually and continually release other amounts of the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. To maintain a constant level of the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound in the body, the Substituted- Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound can be released from the dosage form at a rate \n\n that will replace the amount of Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled- or sustained-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by various conditions, including but not limited to, changes in pH, changes in temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or availability of water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.\n\n\nThe amount of the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound that is effective for the treatment or prevention of a Condition can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro and/or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed will also depend on, e.g., the route of administration and the seriousness of the Condition, and can be decided according to the judgment of a practitioner and/or each animal's circumstances. In other examples thereof, variations will necessarily occur depending upon the weight and physical condition (e.g., hepatic and renal function) of the animal being treated, the affliction to be treated, the severity of the symptoms, the frequency of the dosage interval, the presence of any deleterious side-effects, and the particular compound utilized, among other things.\n\n\nSuitable effective dosage amounts, however, range from about O.Olmg/kg of body weight to about 3000mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day, although they are typically from about 0.01mg/kg of body weight to about 2500mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day or from about 0.01mg/kg of body weight to about lOOOmg/kg of body weight of the animal per day. In one embodiment, the effective dosage amount is about lOOmg/kg of body weight of the animal per day or less. In another embodiment, the effective dosage amount ranges from about 0.01mg/kg of body weight to about 100mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound, in another embodiment, about 0.02mg/kg of body weight to about 50mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day, and in another embodiment, about 0.025mg/kg of body weight to about 20mg/kg of body weight of the animal per day.\n\n\nAdministration can be as a single dose or as a divided dose, hi one embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 24hr until the Condition is abated, hi another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 12hr until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 8hr until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 6hr until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 4hr until the Condition is abated. The effective dosage amounts described herein refer to total amounts administered; that is, if more than one Substituted- Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound is administered, the effective dosage amounts correspond to the total amount administered. \n\n Where a cell capable of expressing the ORL-I receptor, the μ-opioid receptor, the κ-opioid receptor and/or the δ-opioid receptor is contacted with a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged- Piperidine Compound in vitro, the amount effective for inhibiting or activating that receptor function in a cell will typically range from about 10\n\"12\n mol/L to about IQf\n4\n mol/L, in one embodiment, from about 10\n\"12\n mol/L to about 10\n'5\n mol/L, in another embodiment, from about 10\n\"12\n mol/L to about 10\n\"6\n mol/L, and in another embodiment, from about 10\n\"12\n mol/L to about 10\n~9\n mol/L of a solution or suspension of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In one embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension comprising the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound will be from about O.OlμL to about ImL. In another embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension will be about 200μL.\n\n\nThe Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds will have a binding affinity (K\n1\n) for the human ORL-I receptor of about 100OnM or less in one embodiment, or about 50OnM or less in another embodiment, about 10OnM or less in another embodiment, about 5OnM or less in another embodiment, or about 2OnM or less in another embodiment, or about 5nM or less in another embodiment. The binding affinity K\n1\n can be measured in ways known to the art, e.g., by an assay utilizing membranes from recombinant HEK-293 cells expressing the ORL-I receptor.\n\n\nTypically, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds will have a Ki (nM) of about 300 or less for binding to ORL-I receptors. In one embodiment, the Substituted- Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds of the invention will have a Ki (nM) of about 100 or less. In another embodiment, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine\n\n\nCompounds of the invention will have a Ki (nM) of about 35 or less. In another embodiment, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds of the invention will have a Ki (nM) of about 20 or less. In another embodiment, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds of the invention will have a Ki (nM) of about 15 or less. In another embodiment, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds of the invention will have a Ki (nM) of about 10 or less. In another embodiment, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds of the invention will have a Ki (nM) of about 4 or less. In another embodiment, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds of the invention will have a Ki (nM) of about 1 or less. In another embodiment, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds of the invention will have a Ki (nM) of about 0.4 or less. In another embodiment, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds of the invention will have a Ki (nM) of about 0.1 or less.\n\n\nORL-I GTP EC\n50\n is the concentration of a compound providing 50% of the maximal response for the compound at an ORL-I receptor. Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged- Piperidine Compounds typically will have an ORL-I GTP EC\n50\n (nM) of about 5000 or less to stimulate ORL-I receptor function. In one embodiment, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type \n\n Bridged-Piperidine Compounds of the invention will have an ORL-I GTP EC50 (nM) of about 1000 or less. In another embodiment, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds of the invention will have an ORL-I GTP EC\n50\n (nM) of about 100 or less. In another embodiment, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds of the invention will have an ORL-I GTP EC\n50\n (nM) of about 80 or less. In another embodiment, the Substituted-Quinoxaline- Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds of the invention will have an ORL-I GTP EC\n50\n (nM) of about 50 or less. In another embodiment, the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds of the invention will have an ORL-I GTP EC\n50\n (nM) of about 35 or less.

The rats were group-housed and had free access to food and water at all times, except prior to oral administration of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound when food was removed for 16 hours before dosing. A control group acted as a comparison to rats treated with a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound. The control group was administered the carrier for the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound. The volume of carrier administered to the control group was the same as the volume of carrier and Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound administered to the test group. Acute Pain: To assess the actions of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine\n\n\nCompound for the treatment or prevention of acute pain, the rat tail flick test can be used. Rats are gently restrained by hand and the tail exposed to a focused beam of radiant heat at a point 5 cm from the tip using a tail flick unit (Model 7360, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy). Tail flick latencies are defined as the interval between the onset of the thermal stimulus and the flick of the tail. Animals not responding within 20 seconds are removed from the tail flick unit and assigned a withdrawal latency of 20 seconds. Tail flick latencies are measured immediately before (pre-treatment) and 1, 3, and 5 hours following administration of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound. Data are expressed as tail flick latency(s) and the percentage of the maximal possible effect (% MPE), i.e., 20 seconds, is calculated as follows:\n\n\n[ (post administration latency) - (pre-administration latency) ]\n\n\n% MPE = x 100\n\n\n(20 s pre-administration latency)\n\n\nThe rat tail flick test is described in F.E. D'Amour et al, \"A Method for Determining Loss of Pain Sensation,\" J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 72:74-79 (1941).\n\n\nInflammatory Pain: To assess the actions of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged- Piperidine Compound for the treatment or prevention of inflammatory pain, the Freund's complete adjuvant (\"FCA\") model of inflammatory pain was used. FCA-induced inflammation of the rat hind paw is associated with the development of persistent inflammatory mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and provides reliable prediction of the anti-hyperalgesic action of clinically useful analgesic drugs (L. Bartho et al, \"Involvement of Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged- Piperidine Compound Inflammation,\" Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacol. 342:666- 670 (1990)). The left hind paw of each animal was administered a 50 μL intraplantar injection of 50% FCA. 24 hour post injection, the animal was assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining the PWT, or to noxious thermal stimuli by determining the PWL, as \n\n described below. Rats were then administered a single injection of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 or 30mg/kg of either a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound; 30mg/kg of a control selected from Celebrex, indomethacin or naproxen; or carrier. Responses to noxious mechanical stimuli were then determined 1, 3, 5 and 24 hours post administration. Percentage reversal of hyperalgesia for each animal was defined as:\n\n\n[ (post administration PWT/PWL) - (pre-administration PWT/PWL) ]\n\n\n% Reversal = x 100\n\n\n[ (baseline PWT) - (pre-administration PWT) ]\n\n\nAssessments of the actions of the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds that were tested revealed these compounds were efficacious, e.g., Substituted- Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds significantly reduced FC A-induced thermal hyperalgesia, with ED\n50\n values of from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg and maximum % reversal values of from about 20% to about 100%. For example, for the Substituted Quinoxaline- Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound 362, the ED\n50\n value for reversal of thermal hyperalgesia was 0.8mg/kg at 1 hour after administration, 1.5mg/kg at 3 hours after administration, and 3.0mg/kg at 5 hours after administration of Substituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound 362. Additionally, the % reversal of thermal hyperalgesia after administration of a 3 mg/kg dose was 86% at 1 hour after administration, 51% at 3 hours after administration, and 27% at 5 hours after administration of Substituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound 362. And, for Substituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound 361\n,\n, upon administration of a 5mg/kg dose, the % reversal of thermal hyperalgesia was 36% reversal at 1 hour after administration, 90% reversal at 3 hours after administration, and 70% reversal at 5 hours after administration of Substituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound 361.. And, for Substituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound 358, upon administration of 5mg/kg dose, the % reversal of thermal hyperalgesia was 34% reversal at 1 hour after administration, 46% reversal at 3 hours after administration, and 79% reversal at 5 hours after administration of Substituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound 358.\n\n\nSubstituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds 358, 361, and 362 also have surprisingly and desirably reduced abnormal behavioral side effects, such as reduced sedation, hyperactivity and/or hypoactivity. Additionally and surprisingly, Substituted Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound 362 has reduced cardiovascular side effects. These side effects were determined using known methods: an in vitro hERG (human ether a-go-go gene) assay as disclosed in Z. Zhou et al., \"Properties of HERG Channels Stably Expressed in HEK 293 Cells Studied at Physiological Temperature,\" Biophysical! 74:230-241 (1998); and APD (action \n\n potential duration) in guinea pig purkinje fibers as disclosed in J.A. Hey, \"The Guinea Pig Model for Assessing Cardiotoxic Proclivities of Second Generation Antihistamines,\" Arzneimittelforschung 46(8^:834-837 (1996).\n\n\nNeuropathic Pain: To assess the actions of a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged- Piperidine Compound for the treatment or prevention of neuropathic pain, either the Seltzer model or the Chung model can be used.\n\n\nIn the Seltzer model, the partial sciatic nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain was used to produce neuropathic hyperalgesia in rats (Z. Seltzer et al., \"A Novel Behavioral Model of Neuropathic Pain Disorders Produced in Rats by Partial Sciatic Nerve Injury,\" Pain 43:205-218 (1990)). Partial ligation of the left sciatic nerve was performed under isoflurane/0\n2\n inhalation anesthesia. Following induction of anesthesia, the left thigh of the rat was shaved and the sciatic nerve exposed at high thigh level through a small incision and was carefully cleared of surrounding connective tissues at a site near the trocanther just distal to the point at which the posterior biceps semitendinosus nerve branches off of the common sciatic nerve. A 7-0 silk suture was inserted into the nerve with a 3/8 curved, reversed-cutting mini-needle and tightly ligated so that the dorsal 1/3 to \n1\nA of the nerve thickness was held within the ligature. The wound was closed with a single muscle suture (4-0 nylon (Vicryl)) and vetbond tissue glue. Following surgery, the wound area was dusted with antibiotic powder. Sham-treated rats underwent an identical surgical procedure except that the sciatic nerve was not manipulated. Following surgery, animals were weighed and placed on a warm pad until they recovered from anesthesia. Animals were then returned to their home cages until behavioral testing began. The animals were assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, prior to surgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1, 3, and 5 hours after drug administration for rear paw of the animal. Percentage reversal of neuropathic hyperalgesia was defined as:\n\n\n[ (post administration PWT) - (pre-administration PWT) ]\n\n\n% Reversal = x 100\n\n\n[ (baseline PWT) - (pre-administration PWT) ]\n\n\nAssessments of the actions of the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds that were tested revealed that these compounds were efficacious, e.g. Substituted- Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compounds significantly reduced nerve injury-induced mechanical hyperalgesia, with ED\n5\n0 values from about 0.3 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg and maximum % reversal values of from about 20% to about 70%. For example, for the Substituted-Quinoxaline- Type Bridged-Piperidine 362. the % reversal of mechanical hyperalgesia after administration of 3 mg/kg was 60% at 1 and 3 hours after administration, 50% at 5 hours, and 40% at 7 hours. And, \n\n for Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound 405, upon administration of a 3 mg/kg dose, the % reversal of mechanical hyperalgesia was 70% at 1, 3 and 5 hours after administration of the Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound 405.\n\n\nThe Chung model may also be used to assess neuropathic hyperalgesia. In the Chung model, the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain is used to produce mechanical hyperalgesia, thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia in rats. Surgery is performed under isoflurane/O\n2\n inhalation anesthesia. Following induction of anesthesia, a 3 cm incision is made and the left paraspinal muscles are separated from the spinous process at the L\n4\n-S\n2\n levels. The L\n6\n transverse process is carefully removed with a pair of small rongeurs to identify visually the L\n4\n-L\n6\n spinal nerves. The left L\n5\n (or L\n5\n and L\n6\n) spinal nerve(s) is isolated and tightly ligated with silk thread. A complete hemostasis is confirmed and the wound is sutured using non-absorbable sutures, such as nylon sutures or stainless steel staples. Sham-treated rats undergo an identical surgical procedure except that the spinal nerve(s) is not manipulated. Following surgery animals are weighed, administered a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of saline or ringers lactate, the wound area is dusted with antibiotic powder and they are kept on a warm pad until they recover from the anesthesia. Animals are then returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animals are assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, prior to surgery (baseline), then immediately prior to and 1, 3, and 5 hours after being administered a Substituted-Quinoxaline-Type Bridged-Piperidine Compound for the left rear paw of the animal. The animal can also be assessed for response to noxious thermal stimuli or for tactile allodynia, as described below. The Chung model for neuropathic pain is described in S.H. Kim, \"An Experimental Model for Peripheral Neuropathy Produced by Segmental Spinal Nerve Ligation in the Rat,\" Pain 50(3):355-363 (1992).\n\n\nResponse to Mechanical Stimuli as an Assessment of Mechanical Hyperalgesia; The paw pressure assay was used to assess mechanical hyperalgesia. For this assay, hind paw withdrawal thresholds (PWT) to a noxious mechanical stimulus were determined using an analgesymeter (Model 7200, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy) as described in C. Stein, \"Unilateral Inflammation of the Hindpaw in Rats as a Model of Prolonged Noxious Stimulation: Alterations in Behavior and Nociceptive Thresholds,\" Pharmacol. Biochem. and Behavior 3J.:451-455 (1988). The maximum weight that could be applied to the hind paw was set at 250 g and the end point is taken was complete withdrawal of the paw. PWT was determined once for each rat at each time point and either only the affected (ipsilateral) paw was tested, or both the ipsilateral and contralateral (non-injured) paw were tested.\n\n\nResponse to Thermal Stimuli as an Assessment of Thermal Hyperalgesia: The plantar test can be used to assess thermal hyperalgesia. For this test, hind paw withdrawal latencies (PWL) to a noxious thermal stimulus were determined using a plantar test apparatus (commercially \n\n available from Ugo Basile of Italy) following the technique described by K. Hargreaves et al, \"A New and Sensitive Method for Measuring Thermal Nociception in Cutaneous Hyperalgesia,\" Pain 32(l):77-88 (1988). The maximum exposure time was set at 32 seconds to avoid tissue damage and any directed paw withdrawal from the heat source was taken as the end point. Three latencies were determined at each time point and averaged. Either only the affected (ipsilateral) paw was tested, or both the ipsilateral and contralateral (non-injured) paw were tested.\n\n\nAssessment of Tactile Allodynia: To assess tactile allodynia, rats are placed in clear, Plexiglas compartments with a wire mesh floor and allowed to habituate for a period of at least 15minutes. After habituation, a series of von Frey monofilaments are presented to the plantar surface of the left (operated) foot of each rat. The series of von Frey monofilaments consists of six monofilaments of increasing diameter, with the smallest diameter fiber presented first. Five trials are conducted with each filament with each trial separated by approximately 2 minutes. Each presentation lasts for a period of 4-8 seconds or until a nociceptive withdrawal behavior is observed. Flinching, paw withdrawal or licking of the paw are considered nociceptive behavioral responses.\n\n\nThe invention is not to be limited in scope by the specific embodiments disclosed in the examples that are intended as illustrations of a few aspects of the invention and any embodiments that are functionally equivalent are within the scope of this invention.
