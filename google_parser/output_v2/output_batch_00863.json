Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines, represented by Chemical Formula (1), and prodrugs, hydrates, solvates, isomers and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and processes for preparing the same, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Chemical Formula (1), A is selected from the following structures.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antithrombotic and anticoagulant activities of the novel oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines, represented by Chemical Formula (1) according to the present invention result from inhibition against activated coagulation protease known as factor Xa, or inhibition of other activated serine proteases such as factor Xa, factor IXa or thrombin.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nThe blood coagulation factors are distributed in plasma, with various types of factors from 1\nst \ncoagulation factor to 13\nth \ncoagulation factor working sequentially to result in blood coagulation. The mechanism wherein individual blood coagulation factors participate in blood coagulation is shown in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs illustrated in \nFIG. 1\n, blood coagulation is accomplished through very delicate and complex processes wherein reactions occur sequentially. In general, inactive precursors are activated by certain activated coagulation factors (indicated by “a” at the end of the designation of the coagulation factor), and then the coagulation factors are activated. Most of the activated coagulation factors are enzymes called serine protease. These bind to the surface of platelets to sequentially activate the blood coagulation factors to finally create fibrin clot to complete hemostasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThrombin plays the most important role among them. Thrombin is activated from prothrombin (the precursor) via prothrombinase complex consisting of Va factor, Xa factor, Ca++ and phospholipids (PL). When fibrinogen is converted into fibrin thereby, fibrins are crosslinked by the activated XIIIa factor to finally provide stabilized fibrin clot.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to form prothrombinase complex, X factor should be activated to Xa factor; this occurs by means of factor Xase complex. Factors produced via intrinsic pathway such as VIIIa factor, IXa factor, Ca++ and phospholipids (PL), or factors produced via extrinsic pathway such as VIIa factor, tissue factor (TF) and Ca++ serve as the factor Xase complex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the meanwhile, thrombin functions to activate V factor and VIII factor. If thrombin is excessively generated, problem of vaso-occlusion may occur. In order to control such a problem, thrombin would run a process for inhibiting blood coagulation. Thus, thrombin binds to thrombomodulin to activate protein C to generate protein Ca, which will bind to protein S to inactivate the activated Va and VIIIa factors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor Xa is one of the proteases associated with complex processes of blood coagulation, catalyzing conversion of prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin crosslinks with fibrinogen, and then decompose it into fibrin monomer which essentially contributes thrombus formation. Activation of thrombin may induce thromboembolism. However, inhibition of thrombin may inhibit formation of fibrin which is associated with thrombus formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, inhibition of factor Xa may prevent formation of thrombin, and the compounds of Chemical Formula (1) according to the present invention and salts thereof inhibit factor Xa, to participate in the processes of blood coagulation, thereby inhibiting thrombus formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong the compounds known as factor Xa inhibitors up to the present, protein inhibitors are antistasin (ATS), tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP), and the like. ATS is a compound consisting of 119 amino acids, obtained from leeches, having Ki value for factor Xa of 0.05 nM, while TAP is a compound consisting of 60 amino acids having Ki value for factor Xa of 0.5 nM. Those protein inhibitors are not employed in clinical practices at present, while heparin, sulfated polysaccharides, or the like is rarely employed with limitation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDevelopment of inhibitors against blood coagulation, particularly factor Xa inhibitors, as a low molecular compound was disclosed by WO9529189. Factor Xa inhibitors employing indole derivatives are described in WO9933800. Various types of factor Xa inhibitors have been reported, including nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds (WO2004058743), imidazole derivatives (WO2004050636), pyrazole derivatives (WO2004056815), indole-2-carboxamide derivatives (WO2003044014), oxybenzamide derivatives (WO2002051831), guanidine and amidine derivatives (WO2002046159), amino-bicyclic pyrazinone and pyridinone derivatives (WO2004002405).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, those low molecular compounds have to overcome the problems to meet stability in plasma and liver, selectivity from other serine proteases (thrombin, trypsin, cathepsin G, or the like), low toxicity and high bioavailability, as well as high pharmaceutical activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most advanced one among the oxazolidinone type compounds similar to those of the present invention up to the present is Rivaroxaban represented by Chemical Formula (A), of which clinical studies in three aspects are now on progress. Likewise, oxazolidinone derivatives represented by Chemical Formula (B) are disclosed by WO 01/47917. Those compounds, however, have limited solubility yet: for example, about 8 mg/L of solubility for Rivaroxaban. Improvement in this regard is considerably required.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, factor Xa inhibitors using Apixaban derivatives represented by Chemical Formula (C) with cyclic amidine group being incorporated or sulfonyl amidine derivatives represented by Chemical Formula (D) were disclosed in WO 2004/83174. However, oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines (compounds of the present invention) have not been used in this regard.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe keypoint of the studies on FXa inhibitors and thrombin inhibitors in the same cascade having been known up to the present is on the inhibitor comprising P1 group containing benzamidine as an arginine derivative. Since both FXa and thrombin comprise arginine at P1 position, they have similar features of problems. The amidine (including guanidine derivatives) groups which replaces the guanidine moiety of arginine is very hydrophilic, so that most inhibitors containing the groups result in poor or insufficient absorption, and even though they are once absorbed, they frequently exhibit short half-life due to the specific property of high clearance (Drugs of the Future, 1999, 24(7), 771).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmidine itself has strongly basic structure with the PKa of about 12.5. Considering that insufficient absorbance comes from tendency of being positively charged, replacements with derivatives with low basicity have been tried. Representatives include pyridine derivatives, amidrazone, cyclic amines, alkylamine derivatives, aminobenzisoxazole, and the like (U.S. Pat. No. 6,958,356), and a representative example of investigations to replace the amidine with other derivatives is replacement of amidine with amidoxime. Amidoxim has a structure with hydroxyl group attached to amidine itself, being a prodrug taking advantage that weak N—O bond is easily reduced to amidine in vivo. On the base, it makes use of the fact that PKa of amidoxime (about 8-9) is noticeably lower than that of amidine. Representative example of amidoximes is ximelagatran. Such a tendency is equivalently observed in the studies on FXa inhibitors as well as on thrombin inhibitors. When such various trials face limitations, incorporation of neutral P1 group has been rather tried. However, being different from other drug substances, FXa and thrombin inhibitors are advantageous as the blood concentration increases, and the free drug concentration, without binding with protein in blood, is a very important field. In case of neutral P1 group inhibitor, the pharmacological effect rarely appears because the protein binding is relatively high.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to solve the problems described above, the present inventors tried to incorporate a relatively polar group at the other site of the inhibitor, instead of limiting P1 group to neutral groups, in order to 1) improve water solubility and 2) lower the protein binding. Lowered protein binding usually provides beneficial effects in PT assay. Practically, lowered protein binding can be indirectly checked by excellent PT value, in spite of relatively low binding affinity to FXa. Thus, the inventors have proceeded with the studies for increasing pharmacological effect by reducing the protein binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe position for incorporation of polar group according to the invention is P4 site. The theoretical background is described below. The S4 site of FXa comprises the binding site of “\n”-shape with three sides have been surrounded by Tyr99, Phe174 and Trp215. Since the binding site consists only of aromatic amino acid side chains, it is basically different from thrombin surrounded by Leu99, Ile174 and Trp215. During the course of drug design, such differences are positively utilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe S4 pocket of FXa has high tendency of interaction with cationic residue, which is usually called “π-cation interaction”. In practice, some inhibitors have been designed and synthesized as a positively charged group at P4 site. The present invention intends to enhance the pharmacological effect by improving water solubility and lowering the protein binding, as described above, via incorporation of cyclic amidines at P4 site. The reason for selecting cyclic amidine rather than non-substituted amidine is that amidine has three NH bonds (substantially four in biological PH) so that it negatively acts in terms of drug-likeness, while a cyclic amidine having 0 to 1 NH group is advantageous from the same aspect. According to recent investigations, it is more advantageous if the number of pharmaceutically acceptable hydrogen bond donor (HBD) decreases less than that of hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA). According to Lipinski's rule, up to ten (10) HBA's are acceptable, but the number of HBD is restricted to five (5) (Adv. Drug Delivery Rev., 2001, 46, 3-26). Average HBD value of known new drugs is about 1.8—being relatively strict on HBD (J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 6338-48). From this point of view, it is anticipated that a substituted cyclic amidine (number of HBD=0) is far advantageous as compared to an unsubstituted amidine (number of HBD=3). Though a substituted amidine has noticeably decreased number of NH, the amidine functional group itself still has positive charge, so that separation-purification-storage can be done in salt state, thereby having excellent water solubility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom the studies of the present invention, these features of compounds of Chemical Formula (1) were practically confirmed. In the experiment section, the water solubility and protein binding values, as well as 2×PT value versus Ki are diagrammed.\n\n\n \nDISCLOSURE\n\n\nTechnical Problem\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present inventors synthesized novel oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines having useful properties, which can be applied to preparations of pharmaceutical Particularly, since the oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines exhibit factor Xa-inhibiting property, they can be used for treating or preventing thrombosis, myocardial infarction, arteriosclerosis, inflammation, cerebral apoplexy, angina pectoris, recurrent stricture after angioplasty, and thromboembolism such as intermittent claudication. Further, the oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines according to the present invention may function as an inhibitor against factor VIIIa, factor IXa and thrombin as coagulation factors in a blood coagulation cascade.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the object of the invention is to provide oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines exhibiting factor Xa-inhibiting property, and prodrugs, hydrates, solvates, isomers and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother object of the invention is to provide anticoagulant pharmaceutical composition containing oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines, and prodrugs, hydrates, solvates, isomers and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as an active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill another object of the invention is to provide pharmaceutical compositions comprising oxazolidinone derivatives with a cyclic amidines, prodrugs, hydrates, solvates, isomers and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as an active ingredient, for treating or preventing thrombosis, myocardial infarction, arteriosclerosis, inflammation, cerebral apoplexy, angina pectoris, recurrent stricture, intermittent claudication, phlebothrombosis, pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis, myocardial ischemia or thromboembolism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill another object of the invention is to provide pharmaceutical compositions comprising oxazolidinone derivatives with a cyclic amidines, prodrugs, hydrates, solvates, isomers and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in combination with a thrombolytic drug, for treating or preventing diseases in coronary, cerebral or peripheral arteries.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill another object of the invention is to provide use of oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines, prodrugs, hydrates, solvates, isomers and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as an anticoagulant for preserving blood, plasma or blood products in vitro.\n\n\n \nTechnical Solution\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines, represented by Chemical Formula (1), and prodrugs, hydrates, solvates, isomers and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and processes for preparing the same, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[In Chemical Formula (1), A is selected from the following structures:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nX represents hydrogen or halogen;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nY represents halogen;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1 \nand R\n2 \nindependently represent hydrogen, (C\n1\n-C\n7\n)alkyl, (C\n3\n-C\n12\n)cycloalkyl, a 5- to 7-membered heterocycloalkyl containing one or more heteroatom(s) selected from N, O and S, (C\n1\n-C\n7\n)alkyl containing one or more heteroatom(s) selected from N, O and S, (C\n6\nR\n12\n)aryl, (C\n4\n-C\n12\n)heteroaryl, —(CR\n11\nR\n12\n)\nm\nCO—R\n13\n, —(CR\n11\nR\n12\n)\nm\nSO\n2\n—R\n14 \nor —(CR\n11\nR\n12\n)\nm\nCR\n21\n═CR\n22\nR\n23 \ncontaining one or more heteroatom(s) selected from N, O and S;

The preparation processes described below does not restrict the processes for preparing the oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines, represented by Chemical Formula (1) according to the invention, but modification of the processes are obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art. Definitions of the substituents in the Reaction Schemes are identical to those in Chemical Formula (1), if not specified otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nType (B) compounds among the compounds of Chemical Formula (1) can be synthesized according to Reaction Scheme (1) below: they were synthesized via Path (A) or Path (B) depending on the type of X in Chemical Formula (1). Most of compounds of type (B) wherein X is hydrogen were synthesized via Path B, starting from Compound (VI). The compounds wherein X is not hydrogen were synthesized via Path (A) or Path (B), depending upon the starting materials commercially available. As is illustrated in Reaction Scheme (1), Compound (I) or (VI) is reacted with (S)-1-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-2,3-oxiranylamine (II) to synthesize Compound (IV) or (VII), which was then reacted with 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole and DMAP to obtain cyclic oxazolidinone compound (V) or (VIII). Compound (V) can be converted to Compound (VIII) by using Zn(CN)\n2\n/Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n4\n. The synthesis at this stage can be carried out by using 2-(((S)-oxiran-2-yl)methyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione (III) instead of (X)-1-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-2,3-oxiranylamine (II), to obtain an amine compound protected by phthalimide instead of boc. This process will be explained with regard to Reaction Scheme (2). Though Reaction Scheme (1) indicates the process using (S)-1-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-2,3-oxiranylamine (II), both processes may be employed. When boc protective group of Compound (VIII) was removed by using hydrochloric acid, and the product was condensated with chlorothiophenecarboxylic acid or bromothiophenecarboxylic acid, Compound (X) could be obtained. Compound (X) was then treated with hydrochloride gas, and reacted with various diamine compounds (XI) to obtain Compound (B).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nType (C) compounds of Chemical Formula (1) can be synthesized as shown in Reaction Scheme (2) below. In the same manner as for synthesis of Compounds (B), Compounds (C) can be synthesized via Path (C) or Path (D), depending upon the type of X in Chemical Formula (1). First, Compound (XII) was protected by Boc, and reduced by using hydrogen gas under palladium catalyst. Then the product was reacted with 2-(((S)-oxiran-2-yl)methyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione (III) to obtain Compound (XIV). In this stage, (S)-1-(t-butoxycarbonyl)-2,3-oxiranylamine (II) can be also used as explained for Reaction Scheme (1), but only the process employing 2-(((S)-oxiran-2-yl)methyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione (III) is described herein. Compound (XIV) thus obtained was reacted with 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole and DMAP to form a cyclic oxazolidinone compound (XV). The phthalimide protective group of Compound (XV) was then deprotected by using hydrazine, and the product was condensed with chlorothiophene carboxylic acid or bromothiophene carboxylic acid to obtain Compound (XVI).

Relative rate of hydrolysis (as compared to control group without inhibition) was plotted versus logarithm of the concentration of the oxazolidinone derivative with a cyclic amidine represented by Chemical Formula (1) according to the invention, to obtain the concentration of the inhibitor for 50% decrease in the rate of hydrolysis of the substrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe factor Xa inhibiting activity for an oxazolidinone derivative with a cyclic amidine group represented by Chemical Formula (1) according to the invention was determined by calculating the inhibition constant Ki according to Equation (1), as described in Chen and Prusoff, Biochem.

The inhibition constant can be obtained by spectrophotometry whereby the color development is determined as a function of time, after being reacted with a specific substrate which develops color upon hydrolysis caused by action of factor Xa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1) Reagents and Materials\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChromogenic substrate, S-2765(N-Z-D-Arg-Gly-Arg-pNA.2HCl required for measurement of factor Xa activity was purchased from Chromogenics.

For the inhibitor solution, the inhibitor compound according to the present invention was diluted with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) in 10 mM, and then further diluted with third-distilled water (finally 10% DMSO solution), and the solution (10 μL) was added to each well. For the substrate solution, S-2765 was dissolved in third-distilled water in a concentration of 10 mM, and the solution was diluted with 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 150 mM of NaCl and 0.1% PEG 8000, immediately before use, to give a concentration of 1.5 mM. The substrate solution (20 μL) thus prepared was added to each well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo each well containing the reaction solution, added was a solution of factor Xa (20 μL) dissolved in 100 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.8) containing 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% PEG-8000, in a concentration of 13 nM, to initiate hydrolysis by the enzyme. Kinetic analysis of the reaction was performed by a kinetic plate reader (Molecular Devices, Spectramax 190) at 37° C. for 20 minutes. After adding S-2765 chromogenic substrate, the amount of p-nitroanilide generated from the reaction was monitored by means of change of absorbance at 405 nm for 5 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelative rate of hydrolysis (compared to control group without inhibition) versus logarithm of the oxazolidinone derivative with a cyclic amidine group (Chemical Formula I) was plotted to obtain the concentration of the inhibitor to decrease the rate of hydrolysis of the substrate by 50%. GraFit (version 5.0.12) program for statistical process purchased from Erithacus Software was employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen inhibition constant Ki is calculated, it can be calculated according to Equation (1). In the equation, Km value used is 125 μM, which was obtained by alteration of substrate concentration at a constant enzyme concentration.\n\n\n \nExperimental Example 2\n\n\nEffects on Blood Coagulation\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines represented by Chemical Formula (1) according to the invention on blood coagulation was compared by measuring PT (prothrombin time) and aPTT (activated Partial Thromboplastin Time). The procedure of measurement is described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1) Measurement of PT\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCitrated plasma was purchased from Daejeon-Chungnam Blood Institute (located at Daejeon, Korea). A compound solution (5 μL) according to the invention (in a various concentration gradient, 5% DMSO solution) was added to the plasma (45 μm), and the reaction was carried out at 37° C. for 5 minutes. STA-Neoplastine (Diagnostica Stago) (100 μL) was then added thereto, and the duration for plasma coagulation was measured. The duration for plasma coagulation is determined as the point when the absorbance at 340 nm reaches 0.1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2) Measurement of aPTT\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA solution (5 μL) of the oxazolidinone derivative with cyclic amidine group represented by Chemical Formula (1) according to the invention (in a various concentration gradient, 5% DMSO solution) was added to the plasma (45 μm), and the reaction was carried out at 37° C. for 2 minutes. STA-PTT (Diagnostica Stago) (50 μL) was then added thereto. After the reaction at 37° C. for additional 5 minutes, 25 mM CaCl\n2 \n(50 μL) was added thereto, and the duration for plasma coagulation was measured. The duration for plasma coagulation was determined as the point when the absorbance at 340 nm reaches 0.1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3) Determination of % Inhibition Against Thrombus Formation by Means of Arteriovenous Shunt Model (In Vitro) in White Rats\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntithrombotic effect of the compounds according to the present invention was evaluated by using arteriovenous shunt model in white rats. The animals used were male Sprague Dawleys with the body weight of 200-250 g. For one day before the experiment, the animals were fasted. Five to six animals were used for each test group. The compound of Example was orally administered 1 hour before opening of the shunt. The rats were anesthetized by abdominal administration of Rompun (Bay HealthCare) and Chloral hydrate or urethane in an amount of 12 and 50 mg per kg of the body weight. Into the left carotid artery and right jugular vein of the white rat, a polyethylene(PE)-60 tubing filled with physiological saline was inserted and secured. Both ends of individual PE tubing were connected to a silicone tubing having a length of 5 cm in which a cotton thread have been incorporated diagonally, and the shunt was open to provide circulation for 15 minutes. The shunt was then compressed by using jaws, and the cotton thread was carefully removed and the thrombus generated was weighed. The % inhibition of thrombus formation was calculated by using the weight of thrombus obtained from white rats of the control group to which a solution of oral administration was administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe factor Xa inhibition constant, and PT, aPTT and % inhibition values determined according to the method described above are shown in Table 1. As the control substance, Rivaroxaban (Chemical Formula A) was used.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor Xa inhibition constant and % inhibition of blood coagulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nof the compounds represented by Chemical Formula (1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n[Chemical Formula A]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\nPT\n\n\nAPTT\n\n\n% Inhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRivaroxaban\n\n\n0.76\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n0.39\n\n\n83\n\n\n\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n47.05\n\n\n0.22\n\n\n2.29\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n101\n\n\n2.97\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n0.22\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n102\n\n\n3.43\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n0.17\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n106\n\n\n13.07\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n0.55\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n107\n\n\n5.70\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n0.28\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n108\n\n\n2.42\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n109\n\n\n4.67\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n110\n\n\n4.40\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n111\n\n\n10.50\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n0.28\n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n112\n\n\n4.05\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n113\n\n\n9.19\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n0.35\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n114\n\n\n2.45\n\n\n0.03\n\n\n0.12\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n115\n\n\n1.29\n\n\n0.34\n\n\n2.61\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n116\n\n\n3.46\n\n\n0.05\n\n\n0.18\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n117\n\n\n3.18\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n0.29\n\n\n68\n\n\n\n\n\n\n118\n\n\n69.90\n\n\n0.58\n\n\nND\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n119\n\n\n3.70\n\n\n0.03\n\n\nND\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n120\n\n\n27.95\n\n\n0.31\n\n\nND\n\n\n37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n121\n\n\n1.81\n\n\n0.06\n\n\nND\n\n\n35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n123\n\n\n0.39\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n0.26\n\n\n71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n124\n\n\n1.71\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n0.26\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n125\n\n\n2.33\n\n\n0.05\n\n\nND\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n126\n\n\n12.80\n\n\n0.16\n\n\nND\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n127\n\n\n6.14\n\n\n0.12\n\n\nND\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n128\n\n\n13.90\n\n\n0.95\n\n\nND\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n129\n\n\n0.92\n\n\n0.30\n\n\nND\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n130\n\n\n8.60\n\n\n0.94\n\n\nND\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n131\n\n\n0.69\n\n\n0.08\n\n\n0.39\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n132\n\n\n1.09\n\n\n0.29\n\n\n0.88\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n133\n\n\n1.21\n\n\n0.26\n\n\nND\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n134\n\n\n4.01\n\n\n0.36\n\n\nND\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n135\n\n\n31.50\n\n\n0.15\n\n\n1.34\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n136\n\n\n1.78\n\n\n0.10\n\n\nND\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n138\n\n\n2.38\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n0.16\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n139\n\n\n1.47\n\n\n0.07\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n140\n\n\n2.63\n\n\n0.24\n\n\nND\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n142\n\n\n2.52\n\n\n0.04\n\n\n0.17\n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*ND: not determined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs can be seen from Table 1, the oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines represented by Chemical Formula (1) according to the present invention showed higher Ki value than that of Rivaroxaban (the control), but frequently lower PT values. As explained above, though factor Xa catalyzes conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, it is prothrombinase complex which practically plays a critical role in blood coagulation in vivo, so that the inhibition of the complex eventually results in the effect of inhibiting blood coagulation. Thus, PT value rather than Ki value is directly associated with % inhibition of blood coagulation. Accordingly, the oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines represented by Chemical Formula (1) according to the invention might have better effect of inhibiting blood coagulation than the control substance, Rivaroxaban. Further, it is proved that the oxazolidinone derivatives according to the invention exhibit comparable level of pharmacological effect to that of Rivaoxaban (the control substance) from the experiments for determination of % inhibition of thrombus formation by using arteriovenous shunt model in white rats. Therefore, a compound having similar pharmacological activity to that of Rivaoxaban with controlling side effects, particularly increased bleeding, can make a better medicine than Rivaroxaban. The compounds of the present invention can be converted into their salts by using an acid such as HCl, due to high basicity of cyclic amidines, thereby significantly increasing the aqueous solubility.\n\n\n \nExperimental Example 3\n\n\nDetermination of Aqueous Solubility and Plasma Protein Binding\n\n\n \n \n \nThe aqueous solubility and plasma protein binding of the oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines represented by Chemical Formula (1) according to the invention were determined according to the following procedures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1) Determination of Aqueous Solubility\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo each well of a multiscreen solubility 96 well plate(Millipore), added was 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) (190 μL), and solution (10 mM) of a compound according to the present invention in DMSO (10 μL) was added to make the final concentration of 500 μM (5% DMSO). The plate was agitated at ambient temperature for 90 minutes with a rate of 225 rpm. After agitation, the content of the plate was filtered with application of pressure. The filtrate (160 μL) was individually transferred to a uv-96 well plate (Costar), and mixed with 40 μL of acetonitrile, and then agitated at ambient temperature for 10 minutes with a rate of 225 rpm. By means of a plate reader (Molecular Devices, Spectramax 190), absorbances at the wavelengths of 280, 300, 320, 340, 360 and 800 nm were measured. As a reference solution, employed was 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 20% acetonitrile added by 10 mM DMSO solution (8 μL). The aqueous solubility was calculated by subtracting absorbance at 800 nm from total sum of absorbances at 280, 300, 320, 340 and 360 nm of the sample and the reference solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2) Determination of Plasma Protein Binding\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCitrated plasma was purchased from Daejeon-Chungnam Blood Institute (located at Daejeon, Korea). A compound solution (500 μM in DMSO) (10 μL), according to the invention Was added to the plasma (1 mL), and the reaction was carried out at 37° C. and 120 rpm for 60 minutes. To three wells of Ultracel-10 filter plate (Millipore), the reaction solution was transferred (300 μL each). Then, the plasma solution (70 μL) was taken, and the total concentration of the compound was quantified by means of LC-MS/MS (API3000, ABI). After centrifuging the Ultracel-10 filter plate at 37° C. and 2000×g for 45 minutes, the filtrate was taken to determine the concentration of the compound which was not bound to the plasma protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPercentage of plasma protein binding was obtained via Equation (2):\n\n\n \n \n \n% Protein binding=(1−concentration of compound in filtrate/concentration of compound in entire solution)×100%\n\n\n \n \n \nFree=100−% Protein binding  [Equation 2]\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aqueous solubility and protein binding (%) determined according to the procedure described above are shown in Table 2.

These results suggest that the oxazolidinone derivatives with cyclic amidines represented by Chemical Formula (1) according to the invention may exhibit better pharmacological activity when they are clinically used in an animal's body.
