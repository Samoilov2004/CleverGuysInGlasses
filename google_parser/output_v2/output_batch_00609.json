Description\n\n\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis present invention is a continuation patent application which claims priority to PCT patent application number PCT/GB2009/000672, filed Mar. 11, 1009, which claims priority to Great Britain patent application number 0804702.9, filed Mar. 13, 2008, the entirety of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nThe present invention relates to compounds that are inhibitors of cysteine proteinases, pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds, and their use in therapy. More specifically, the invention relates to compounds that are dual inhibitors of cathepsin S and cathepsin K, which are cysteine proteinases of the CA clan. Such compounds are particularly useful for the in vivo therapeutic treatment of diseases in which participation of cathepsin S and cathepsin K are implicated.\n\n\nBACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION\n\n\nProteinases form a substantial group of biological molecules which to date constitute approximately 2% of all the gene products identified following analysis of several completed genome sequencing programmes. Proteinases have evolved to participate in an enormous range of biological processes, mediating their effect by cleavage of peptide amide bonds within the myriad of proteins found in nature. This hydrolytic action is performed by initially recognising, then binding to, particular three-dimensional electronic surfaces displayed by a protein, which align the bond for cleavage precisely within the proteinase catalytic site. Catalytic hydrolysis then commences through nucleophilic attack of the amide bond to be cleaved either via an amino acid side-chain of the proteinase itself, or through the action of a water molecule that is bound to and activated by the proteinase. Proteinases in which the attacking nucleophile is the thiol side-chain of a Cys residue are known as cysteine proteinases. The general classification of ‘cysteine proteinase’ contains many members found in a wide range of organisms from viruses, bacteria, protozoa, plants and fungi to mammals. Cathepsins S and K and indeed many other crucial mammalian proteinases belong to the papain-like CAC1 family (see Barrett, A. J et al, in ‘Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes’, Eds. Barrett, A. J., Rawlings, N. D., and Woessner, J. F. Publ. Academic Press, 1998, for a thorough discussion).\n\n\nTo date, cysteine proteinases have been classified into five clans, CA, CB, CC, CD and CE (Barrett, A. J. et al, 1998). A proteinase from the tropical papaya fruit ‘papain’ forms the foundation of clan CA, which currently contains over 80 distinct and complete entries in various sequence databases, with many more expected from the current genome sequencing efforts. Proteinases of clan CA/family C1 have been implicated in a multitude of house-keeping roles and disease processes. e.g. human proteinases such as cathepsin K (osteoporosis, osteoarthritis), cathepsin S (multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disorders), cathepsin L (metastases), cathepsin B (metastases, arthritis), cathepsin F (antigen processing), cathepsin V (T-cell selection), dipeptidyl peptidase I (granulocyte serine proteinase activation) or parasitic proteinases such as falcipain (malaria parasite \nPlasmodium falciparum\n) and cruzipain (\nTrypanosoma cruzi \ninfection).\n\n\nThere currently exists a major unmet need for safe orally administered medications for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular disease, which exhibit significant damage and remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM). Destruction of the ECM is brought about through proteolysis of its elastin, collagen and proteoglycan constituents, which provide structure, elasticity and tensile strength to materials such as cartilage, bone, lung and vascular tissue. The proteolytic enzymes cathepsin S and cathepsin K are up-regulated under inflammatory conditions and have been implicated in the degradation of ECM components.\n\n\nCathepsins K and S are found over-expressed in rheumatoid and osteoarthritic synovium and have been shown to degrade collagen type-I and type-II, as well as aggrecan (a multidomain proteoglycan component of articular cartilage) respectively (see Hou, W. S. et al., Arthritis & rheumatism, 46 (3). 663-674, 2002; Hou, W. S. et al., Biol Chem, 384. 891-897, 2003 & Yasuda, Y. et al., Adv Drug Del Rev, 57. 973-993, 2005 and references cited herein). In addition, transgenic mice overexpressing cathepsin K, show spontaneous development of synovitis and cartilage degeneration (see Morko, J. et al., Arthritis & rheumatism, 52 (12). 3713-3717, 2005). Cathepsin S is also known to play a role in auto-antigen presentation in rheumatoid arthritis, helping prime the immune system to attack self-tissues in susceptible joints (e.g. see Podolin, P. L., et al., inflamm Res, 50:S159.2001).\n\n\nAs well as destruction of articular cartilage, cathepsin S and cathepsin K demonstrate potent elastinolytic activity and are involved in a broad spectrum of pathological conditions associated with elastin degradation, such as COPD and cardiovascular disease. Both enzymes are readily secreted by macrophages and smooth muscle cells and have been shown to degrade elastins from bovine aorta and lung tissue. Furthermore, in a murine model of COPD/emphysema, induced by IL-13, Cathepsin S and K were shown to be present in the diseased lung tissue and infiltrating macrophage and disease symptoms were abrogated by cysteine proteinase inhibitors (see Wolters, P. J. and Chapman, H. A., Respir Res, 1. 170-177, 2000; Novinec, M. et al., J Biol Chem, 282 (11). 7893-7902, 2007; Zheng, T. et al., J Clin Invest, 106. 1081-1093, 2000). Cathepsins S and K are also responsible for the vascular tissue damage associated with chronic cardiovascular disease and vascular injury. In murine models of atherosclerosis, Cathepsin S has been found in abundance, in atherosclerotic plaques (secreted from infiltrating macrophage) and induces plaque rupture (see Rodgers, K. J. et al., Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 26 (4):851-856, 2006). Cathepsin K and cathepsin S have been associated with vascular remodeling and causing ECM damage during the development of atherosclerosis and vascular injury-induced neointimal formation (see Cheng, X. W. et al., Am J Pathol, 164 (1). 243-251, 2004). While both enzymes are involved in the growth and rupture of abdominal aortic aaneurysms (see Abdul-Hussien, H. et al., Am J Pathol, 170 (3). 809-817, 2007).\n\n\nThus inhibition of cathepsins K and S offer an attractive approach to prevent the underlying tissue destruction which occurs in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, COPD and cardiovascular disease.\n\n\nIn the prior art, the development of cysteine proteinase inhibitors for human use has recently been an area of intense activity (e.g. see Deaton, D. N. and Kumar, S., Prog. Med. Chem. 42, 245-375, 2004; Bromme, D. and Kaleta, J., Curr. Pharm. Des., 8, 1639-1658, 2002; Kim, W. and Kang, K., Expert Opin. Ther. Patents, 12 (3), 419-432, 2002; Leung-Toung, R. et al. Curr. Med. Chem., 9, 979-1002, 2002; Lecaille, F. et al., Chem. Rev., 102, 4459-4488, 2002; Hernandez, A. A. and Roush, W. R., Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., 6, 459-465, 2002; Link, J. O. and Zipfel, S. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev., 9 (4), 471-482, 2006). Considering the CAC1 family members, particular emphasis has been placed upon the development of inhibitors of human cathepsins, primarily cathepsin K (osteoporosis) and cathepsin S (autoimmune disorders) through the use of covalent-bound but reversible peptide and peptidomimetic nitriles (e.g. see Bekkali, Y. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 17 (9), 2465-2469, 2007; WO-A-07137738, WO-A-07003056), linear and cyclic peptide and peptidomimetic ketones (e.g. see Veber, D. F. and Thompson, S. K., Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev., 3 (4), 362-369, 2000; WO-A-02057270, WO-A-04007501, WO-A-06064286, WO-A-05066180, WO-A-0069855), ketoheterocycles (e.g. see Palmer, J. T. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 16 (11), 2909-2914, 2006, WO-A-04000838), α-ketoamides (e.g. see WO-A-06102243), cyanamides (WO-A-01077073, WO-A-01068645) and arylnitriles (e.g. see WO-A-07080191, WO-A-07039470, WO-A-06018284, WO-A-05121106, WO-A-04000843). Inhibition of CAC1 proteases by non-covalent bound compounds has been extensively described in the literature. Particular emphasis has been placed upon inhibition of cathepsin K and cathepsin S by arylaminoethylamides (e.g. see Altmann, E., et al, J. Med. Chem., 45 (12), 2352-2354, 2002; Chatterjee, A. K. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 17 (10), 2899-2903, 2007; US-20050113356, US-20050107368, US-20050118568) and substituted pyrazoles or piperidines (e.g. see Wei, J., et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 17 (20), 5525-5528, 2007; US-2007117785, US-2003073672, WO-A-02020013).\n\n\nThus the extensive prior art describes potent in vitro inhibitors of either cathepsin S or cathepsin K and inhibitors showing efficacy in numerous animal models of disease. However, since these enzymes appear to work in tandem and both are present in many chronic inflammatory diseases, a single compound possessing dual inhibitory activity would be a distinct advantage. There are presently no human therapeutic dual inhibitors of cathepsin K and S.\n\n\nRecently, Quibell, M. (WO-A-02057270) described a new motif for the general inhibition of CAC1 proteinases based upon a cis-5,5-bicyclic ketone (1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased upon this motif, highly potent and selective inhibitors of cathepsin K were discovered (see WO-A-0807109, WO-A-0807103, WO-A-0807130, WO-A-0807114, WO-A-0807127, WO-A-0807107, WO-A-0807112). The present inventors have now discovered a small genus of 6-(S)-chlorotetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-ones that exhibit potent dual inhibition versus human cathepsins S and K.\n\n\nSTATEMENT OF

stable straight and branched chain aliphatic carbon chains which may be optionally substituted. Preferred examples include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, hexyl, heptyl and any simple isomers thereof. Suitable substituents include, for example, one or more C\n1-6 \nalkoxy, OH, COOH, COOMe, NH\n2\n, NMe\n2\n, NHMe, NO\n2\n, CN and/or CF\n3 \ngroups. Additionally, where the alkyl group contains two or more contiguous carbon atoms, an alkene group (—CH═CH—) or alkyne group (—C≡C—) may be present. Furthermore, the alkyl group may optionally contain one or more heteroatoms for example, to give ethers, thioethers, sulphones, sulphonamides, substituted amines, amidines, guanidines, carboxylic acids, carboxamides. If the heteroatom is located at a chain terminus then it is appropriately substituted with one or two hydrogen atoms. For example, the group CH\n3\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— is defined within ‘alkyl’ as a C\n4 \nalkyl that contains a centrally positioned heteroatom whereas the group CH\n3\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— is defined within ‘alkyl’ as an unsubstituted C\n4 \nalkyl. Preferably, the alkyl group is a C\n1-6 \nalkyl group, more preferably a C\n1-4 \ngroup.\n\n\nThe term ‘cycloalkyl’ as applied herein refers to a cyclic alkyl group (i.e. a carbocyclic ring) which may be substituted (mono- or poly-) or unsubstituted. Suitable substituents include, for example, one or more C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n1-6 \nalkoxy, OH, COOH, COOMe, NH\n2\n, NMe\n2\n, NHMe, NO\n2\n, CN, CF\n3 \nand/or halo groups. Preferably, the cycloalkyl group is a C\n3-6\n-cycloalkyl, even more preferably a C\n3-4 \ncycloalkyl group. Examples include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and the like. In addition, the carbocyclic ring itself may optionally contain one or more heteroatoms, for example, to give a heterocycloalkyl group such as tetrahydrofuran, pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine or morpholine.\n\n\nThe term ‘alkyoxy’ refers to the group ‘O-alkyl’ or ‘O-cycloalkyl’, wherein alkyl and cycloalkyl are as defined above.\n\n\n‘Halogen’ or ‘halo’ as applied herein encompasses F, Cl, Br, I.\n\n\nThe term ‘haloalkyl’ refers to an alkyl group as defined above substituted by one or more halogen atoms.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term ‘aryl’ refers to a stable 5 or 6-membered monocylic ring which is unsaturated. The aryl group may optionally include one or more heteroatoms selected from O, N and S. In addition, the aryl group may be optionally substituted, for example, by one or more C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n1-6 \nalkoxy, OH, COOH, COOMe, NH\n2\n, NMe\n2\n, NHMe, NO\n2\n, CN, CF\n3 \nand/or halo groups. More preferably, the aryl group may be optionally substituted by one or more Me, OMe, OEt, OiPr, NO\n2\n, Cl or F groups.\n\n\nThe term ‘aralkyl’ as applied herein includes an alkyl group as defined above in combination with an aryl group. The aryl group may be an aromatic ring, for example, a stable 5 or 6-membered monocylic or a stable 9 or 10-membered bicyclic ring which is unsaturated. The aryl group may optionally comprise one or more heteroatoms selected from O, N and S. In addition, the aryl group may be optionally substituted, for example, by one or more C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n1-6 \nalkoxy, OH, COOH, COOMe, NH\n2\n, NMe\n2\n, NHMe, NO\n2\n, CN, CF\n3 \nand/or halo groups. Preferably, the aralkyl group is a C\n1-8\n-alkyl-C\n5-10\n-aryl group, even more preferably a C\n1-8\n-alkyl-phenyl group. More preferably still, the alkyl-aryl group is selected from CH\n2\nPh and CH\n2\nOCH\n2\nPh.\n\n\nThe present invention includes all salts, hydrates, solvates, complexes and prodrugs of the compounds of this invention. The term “compound” is intended to include all such salts, hydrates, solvates, complexes and prodrugs, unless the context requires otherwise.\n\n\nIn particular, the skilled person will appreciate that the ketone group of the bicycle core of compounds of formula (I) may exist in alternative forms such as the hydrate (as shown below), and the invention extends to all such alternative forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviations and symbols commonly used in the peptide and chemical arts are used herein to describe compounds of the present invention, following the general guidelines presented by the IUPAC-IUB Joint Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature as described in \nEur. J. Biochem., \n158, 9-, 1984.

preferred embodiment, the compound of the invention is selected from Examples 1-39 described hereinbelow.\n\n\nEven more preferably, the compound of the invention is selected from Examples 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18-39 described hereinbelow.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention admixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, excipients or carriers. Other active materials may also be present, as may be considered appropriate or advisable for the disease or condition being treated or prevented.\n\n\nEven though the compounds of the present invention (including their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters and pharmaceutically acceptable solvates) can be administered alone, they will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent, particularly for human therapy. The pharmaceutical compositions may be for human or animal usage in human and veterinary medicine.\n\n\nExamples of such suitable excipients for the various different forms of pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be found in the “Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 2\nnd \nEdition, (1994), Edited by A Wade and P J Weller. The carrier, or, if more than one be present, each of the carriers, must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient.\n\n\nAcceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985).\n\n\nExamples of suitable carriers include lactose, starch, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sorbitol and the like. Examples of suitable diluents include ethanol, glycerol and water.\n\n\nThe choice of pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent can be selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise as, or in addition to, the carrier, excipient or diluent any suitable binder(s), lubricant(s), suspending agent(s), coating agent(s), solubilising agent(s).\n\n\nExamples of suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose, anhydrous lactose, free-flow lactose, beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums, such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethyl cellulose and polyethylene glycol.\n\n\nExamples of suitable lubricants include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like.\n\n\nPreservatives, stabilizers, dyes and even flavoring agents may be provided in the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of preservatives include sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Antioxidants and suspending agents may be also used.\n\n\nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition as described above, the process comprising bringing the active compound(s) into association with the carrier, for example by admixture.\n\n\nIn general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active agent with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then if necessary shaping the product. The invention extends to methods for preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising bringing a compound of general formula (I) in conjunction or association with a pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier or vehicle.\n\n\nSalts/Esters\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention can be present as salts or esters, in particular pharmaceutically and veterinarily acceptable salts or esters.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention include suitable acid addition or base salts thereof. A review of suitable pharmaceutical salts may be found in Berge et al, J Pharm Sci, 66, 1-19 (1977). Salts are formed, for example with strong inorganic acids such as mineral acids, e.g. hydrohalic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide and hydroiodide, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid sulphate, bisulphate, hemisulphate, thiocyanate, persulphate and sulphonic acids; with strong organic carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 4 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with amino acids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid. Salts which are not pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable may still be valuable as intermediates.\n\n\nPreferred salts include, for example, acetate, trifluoroacetate, lactate, gluconate, citrate, tartrate, maleate, malate, pantothenate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, butyrate, digluconate, cyclopentanate, glucoheptanate, glycerophosphate, oxalate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, nicotinate, palmoate, pectinate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, proprionate, tartrate, lactobionate, pivolate, camphorate, undecanoate and succinate, organic sulphonic acids such as methanesulphonate, ethanesulphonate, 2-hydroxyethane sulphonate, camphorsulphonate, 2-naphthalenesulphonate, benzenesulphonate, p-chlorobenzenesulphonate and p-toluenesulphonate; and inorganic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, bisulphate, hemisulphate, thiocyanate, persulphate, phosphoric and sulphonic acids.\n\n\nEsters are formed either using organic acids or alcohols/hydroxides, depending on the functional group being esterified. Organic acids include carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 12 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with amino acids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C\n1\n-C\n4\n)-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid. Suitable hydroxides include inorganic hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide. Alcohols include alkane alcohols of 1-12 carbon atoms which may be unsubstituted or substituted, e.g. by a halogen).\n\n\nEnantiomers/Tautomers\n\n\nIn all aspects of the present invention previously discussed, the invention includes, where appropriate all enantiomers, diastereoisomers and tautomers of the compounds of the invention. The person skilled in the art will recognise compounds that possess optical properties (one or more chiral carbon atoms) or tautomeric characteristics. The corresponding enantiomers and/or tautomers may be isolated/prepared by methods known in the art.\n\n\nEnantiomers are characterised by the absolute configuration of their chiral centres and described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn, Ingold and Prelog. Such conventions are well known in the art (e.g. see ‘Advanced Organic Chemistry’, 3\nrd \nedition, ed. March, J., John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1985).\n\n\nCompounds of the invention containing a chiral centre may be used as a racemic mixture, an enantiomerically enriched mixture, or the racemic mixture may be separated using well-known techniques and an individual enantiomer may be used alone.\n\n\nStereo and Geometric Isomers\n\n\nSome of the compounds of the invention may exist as stereoisomers and/or geometric isomers-e.g. they may possess one or more asymmetric and/or geometric centres and so may exist in two or more stereoisomeric and/or geometric forms. The present invention contemplates the use of all the individual stereoisomers and geometric isomers of those inhibitor agents, and mixtures thereof. The terms used in the claims encompass these forms, provided said forms retain the appropriate functional activity (though not necessarily to the same degree).\n\n\nThe present invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of the agent or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. An isotopic variation of an agent of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine and chlorine such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n17\nO, \n18\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF and \n36\nCl, respectively. Certain isotopic variations of the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as \n3\nH or \n14\nC is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated, i.e., \n3\nH, and carbon-14, i.e., \n14\nC, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., \n2\nH, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. For example, the invention includes compounds of general formula (I) where any hydrogen atom has been replaced by a deuterium atom. Isotopic variations of the agent of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of this invention can generally be prepared by conventional procedures using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents.\n\n\nProdrugs\n\n\nThe invention further includes the compounds of the present invention in prodrug form, i.e. covalently bonded compounds which release the active parent drug according to general formula (I) in vivo. Such prodrugs are generally compounds of the invention wherein one or more appropriate groups have been modified such that the modification may be reversed upon administration to a human or mammalian subject. Reversion is usually performed by an enzyme naturally present in such subject, though it is possible for a second agent to be administered together with such a prodrug in order to perform the reversion in vivo. Examples of such modifications include ester (for example, any of those described above), wherein the reversion may be carried out be an esterase etc. Other such systems will be well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nA prodrug may for example constitute a ketal or hemiketal derivative of the exocyclic ketone functionality present in the 6-(S)-chlorotetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one scaffold.\n\n\nSolvates\n\n\nThe present invention also includes solvate forms of the compounds of the present invention. The terms used in the claims encompass these forms.\n\n\nPolymorphs\n\n\nThe invention further relates to the compounds of the present invention in their various crystalline forms, polymorphic forms and (an)hydrous forms. It is well established within the pharmaceutical industry that chemical compounds may be isolated in any of such forms by slightly varying the method of purification and or isolation form the solvents used in the synthetic preparation of such compounds.\n\n\nAssays\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention relates to the use of a compound of the invention as defined hereinabove in an assay for identifying further candidate compounds that influence the activity of a cysteine proteinase.\n\n\nPreferably, the assay is capable of identifying candidate compounds that are capable of inhibiting one or more CAC1 cysteine proteinases.\n\n\nMore preferably, the assay is a competitive binding assay.\n\n\nPreferably, the candidate compound is generated by conventional SAR modification of a compound of the invention.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “conventional SAR modification” refers to standard methods known in the art for varying a given compound by way of chemical derivatisation.\n\n\nThus, in one aspect, the identified compound may act as a model (for example, a template) for the development of other compounds. The compounds employed in such a test may be free in solution, affixed to a solid support, borne on a cell surface, or located intracellularly. The abolition of activity or the formation of binding complexes between the compound and the agent being tested may be measured.\n\n\nThe assay of the present invention may be a screen, whereby a number of agents are tested. In one aspect, the assay method of the present invention is a high through-put screen.\n\n\nThis invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralising antibodies capable of binding a compound specifically compete with a test compound for binding to a compound.\n\n\nAnother technique for screening provides for high throughput screening (HTS) of agents having suitable binding affinity to the substances and is based upon the method described in detail in WO 84/03564.\n\n\nIt is expected that the assay methods of the present invention will be suitable for both small and large-scale screening of test compounds as well as in quantitative assays. Preferably, the competitive binding assay comprises contacting a compound of the invention with a cysteine proteinase in the presence of a known substrate of said enzyme and detecting any change in the interaction between said cysteine proteinase and said known substrate.\n\n\nA further aspect of the invention provides a method of detecting the binding of a ligand to a cysteine proteinase, said method comprising the steps of:\n\n \n \n(i) contacting a ligand with cysteine proteinase in the presence of a known substrate of said enzyme;\n \n(ii) detecting any change in the interaction between said enzyme and said known substrate;\n\n\nand wherein said ligand is a compound of the invention.\n\n \n\n\nOne aspect of the invention relates to a process comprising the steps of:\n\n \n \n(a) performing an assay method described hereinabove;\n \n(b) identifying one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain; and\n \n(c) preparing a quantity of said one or more ligands.\n \n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention provides a process comprising the steps of:\n\n \n \n(a) performing an assay method described hereinabove;\n \n(b) identifying one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain; and\n \n(c) preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising said one or more ligands.\n \n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention provides a process comprising the steps of:\n\n \n \n(a) performing an assay method described hereinabove;\n \n(b) identifying one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain;\n \n(c) modifying said one or more ligands capable of binding to a ligand binding domain;\n \n(d) performing the assay method described hereinabove;\n \n(e) optionally preparing a pharmaceutical composition comprising said one or more ligands.\n \n\n\nThe invention also relates to a ligand identified by the method described hereinabove.\n\n\nYet another aspect of the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a ligand identified by the method described hereinabove.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention relates to the use of a ligand identified by the method described hereinabove in the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for use in the treatment of one or more disorders selected from rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases which exhibit significant damage and remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and chronic pain.\n\n\nThe above methods may be used to screen for a ligand useful as an inhibitor of one or more cysteine proteinases.\n\n\nCompounds of general formula (I) are useful both as laboratory tools and as therapeutic agents. In the laboratory certain compounds of the invention are useful in establishing whether a known or newly discovered cysteine proteinase contributes a critical or at least significant biochemical function during the establishment or progression of a disease state, a process commonly referred to as ‘target validation’.\n\n\nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of validating a known or putative cysteine proteinase as a therapeutic target, the method comprising:\n\n\n(a) assessing the in vitro binding of a compound as described above to an isolated known or putative cysteine proteinase, providing a measure of potency; and optionally, one or more of the steps of:\n\n\n(b) assessing the binding of the compound to closely related homologous proteinases of the target and general house-keeping proteinases (e.g. trypsin) to provide a measure of selectivity;\n\n\n(c) monitoring a cell-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity, in the presence of the compound; and\n\n\n(d) monitoring an animal model-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity in the presence of the compound.\n\n\nThe invention therefore provides a method of validating a known or putative cysteine proteinase as a therapeutic target. Differing approaches and levels of complexity are appropriate to the effective inhibition and ‘validation’ of a particular target. In the first instance, the method comprises assessing the in vitro binding of a compound of general formula (I) to an isolated known or putative cysteine proteinase, providing a measure of ‘potency’. An additional assessment of the binding of a compound of general formula (I) to closely related homologous proteinases of the target and general house-keeping proteinases (e.g. trypsin) provides a measure of ‘selectivity’. A second level of complexity may be assessed by monitoring a cell-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity, in the presence of a compound of general formula (I). For example, an ‘osteoclast resorption assay’ has been utilised as a cell-based secondary in vitro testing system for monitoring the activity of cathepsin K and the biochemical effect of proteinase inhibitors (e.g. see WO-A-9850533). An ‘MHC—II processing—T-cell activation assay’ has been utilised as a cell-based secondary in vitro testing system for monitoring the activity of cathepsin S and the biochemical effect of proteinase inhibitors (Shi, G-P., et al, \nImmunity, \n10, 197-206, 1999). When investigating viral or bacterial infections such a marker could simply be a functional assessment of viral (e.g. count of mRNA copies) or bacterial loading and assessing the biochemical effect of proteinase inhibitors. A third level of complexity may be assessed by monitoring an animal model-based functional marker of a particular cysteine proteinase activity, in the presence of a compound of general formula (I). For example, murine models of \nLeishmania \ninfection, \nP. vinckei \ninfection, malaria (inhibition of falcipain) and \nT. cruzi \ninfection (cruzipain), indicate that inhibition of cysteine proteinases that play a key role in pathogen propagation is effective in arresting disease symptoms, ‘validating’ said targets.\n\n\nThe invention therefore extends to the use of a compound of general formula (I) in the validation of a known or putative cysteine proteinase as a therapeutic target.\n\n\nBiological Activity\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are structurally distinct from the prior art (e.g. WO-A-02057270; Quibell, M. et. al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 13, 609-625, 2005; Quibell M, et al Bioorg. Med. Chem., 12, 5689-5710, 2004; WO-A-05066180) in that a 6-(S)-chloro substituent and a cyclohexylglycyl or cyclopentylglycyl moiety form an integral part. This combination of features provides compounds with surprisingly high dual efficacies for human cathepsin S and cathepsin K which are important properties required for development of an efficacious dual therapeutic. If either of these intrinsic moieties is removed from compounds of formula I, then a surprisingly large loss in potency and/or a significant loss in selectivity is observed. Indeed, all of the compounds of the present invention prepared to date exhibit dual potent in vitro inhibition for human cathepsin S and cathepsin K with Ki<50 nM. In contrast, the majority of the eighty-two prior art compounds detailed in WO-A-02057270 are either inhibitors of cathepsin S or cathepsin K and in the majority of examples, greater than 100-fold less potent against either proteinase.\n\n\nThe closest prior art, compound (38) (see WO-A-02057270, pg 151), exhibits a 65-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S and a greater than 114-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin K upon addition of a 6-(S)-chloro substituent and substitution of the (S)-cyclohexylalanyl moiety with (S)-cyclohexylglycyl (EXAMPLE 1). The surprising synergistic relationship between these two intrinsic changes is clearly seen when comparing prior art compound (38) with novel compounds (1-2) and EXAMPLE 1. Prior art compound (38) exhibits a 2.5-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S and a greater than 13-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin K upon substitution of the (S)-cyclohexylalanyl moiety with (S)-cyclohexylglycyl (Compound 1), providing a dual inhibitor that has only moderate potency versus cathepsins S and K. Further addition of a 6-(S)-fluoro substituent to Compound 1 provides a 3.8-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S and a 3.2-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin K (Compound 2), again providing a dual inhibitor that has only moderate potency versus cathepsins S and K. Alternatively, addition of a 6-(S)-chloro substituent to Compound 1 provides a 27-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S and a 8.7-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin K (EXAMPLE 1) providing a dual inhibitor that has high potency versus cathepsins S and K.\n\n\nBy way of further comparison, consider novel compounds (3-4) and EXAMPLE 2. Addition of a 6-(S)-fluoro substituent to compound 3 provides a 3.4-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S and a 1.7-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin K (Compound 4), providing a dual inhibitor that has only moderate potency versus cathepsins S and K. Alternatively, addition of a 6-(S)-chloro substituent to Compound 3 provides a 47-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin S and a 20.5-fold improvement in in vitro potency against human cathepsin K (EXAMPLE 2), providing a dual inhibitor that has high potency versus cathepsins S and K.\n\n\nAs a further comparison, consider novel compound (5) with EXAMPLES 3 and 4. The 6-(R)-chloro analogue (compound 5) has an in vitro Ki of 32 nM versus cathespin S and 230 nM versus cathespin K. The stereochemical importance of the 6-(S)-chloro substituent in clearly seen when comparing compound (5) with EXAMPLE 3 that has an in vitro Ki of 1.7 nM versus cathespin S and 23 nM versus cathespin K. Considering EXAMPLE 3, substitution of the (S)-cyclohexylglycyl moiety for the (S)-cyclopentylglycyl moiety provides EXAMPLE 4 that has an in vitro Ki of 14.6 nM versus cathespin S and 10.4 nM versus cathespin K. Both EXAMPLE 3 and 4 are highly potent dual inhibitors of cathepsins S and K.\n\n\nPreferably, the compounds exhibit dual in vitro inhibition versus human cathepsin S and cathepsin K with Ki<50 nM, more preferably <25 nM and even more preferably <10 nM.\n\n\nTherapeutic Use\n\n\nCompounds of general formula (I) are useful for the in vivo treatment or prevention of diseases in which participation of a cysteine proteinase is implicated.\n\n\nPreferably, the compound of general formula I is a dual inhibitor of cathepsin S and cathepsin K. As used herein, the term “dual for cathepsin S and K” means that the inhibitor is a potent inhibitor of oth cathepsin S and cathepsin K. Preferably, the inhibitor exhibits a selectivity ratio for cathepsin S and cathepsin K over other mammalian CAC1 cysteinyl proteinases of greater than 2-fold, more preferably greater than 5-fold, more preferably greater than 10-fold, even more preferably greater than 25-fold, more preferably still, greater than 50-fold or 100-fold.\n\n\nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of general formula (I) for use in medicine, especially for preventing or treating diseases in which the disease pathology may be modified by inhibiting a cysteine proteinase.\n\n\nAccording to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of a compound of general formula (I) in the preparation of a medicament for preventing or treating diseases in which the disease pathology may be modified by inhibiting a cysteine proteinase.\n\n\nCertain cysteine proteinases function in the normal physiological process of protein degradation in animals, including humans, e.g. in the degradation of connective tissue. However, elevated levels of these enzymes in the body can result in pathological conditions leading to disease. Thus, cysteine proteinases have been implicated in various disease states, including but not limited to, infections by \nPneumocystis carinii, Trypsanoma cruzi, Trypsanoma brucei brucei \nand \nCrithidia fusiculata\n; as well as in osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, autoimmunity, schistosomiasis, malaria, tumour metastasis, metachromatic leukodystrophy, muscular dystrophy, amytrophy, and the like (see WO-A-9404172 and EP-A-0603873 and references cited therein). Additionally, a secreted bacterial cysteine proteinase from \nS. Aureus \ncalled staphylopain has been implicated as a bacterial virulence factor (Potempa, J., et al. J. Biol. Chem., 262 (6), 2664-2667, 1998).\n\n\nThe invention is useful in the prevention and/or treatment of each of the disease states mentioned or implied above. The present invention also is useful in a method of treatment or prevention of diseases caused by pathological levels of cysteine proteinases, particularly cysteine proteinases of the papain superfamily, which methods comprise administering to an animal, particularly a mammal, most particularly a human, in need thereof a compound of the present invention. The present invention particularly provides methods for treating diseases in which cysteine proteinases are implicated, including infections by \nPneumocystis carinii, Trypsanoma cruzi, Trypsanoma brucei, Leishmania mexicana, Clostridium histolyticum, Staphylococcus aureus\n, foot-and-mouth disease virus and \nCrithidia fusiculata\n; as well as in osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, autoimmunity, schistosomiasis, malaria, tumour metastasis, metachromatic leukodystrophy, muscular dystrophy, amytrophy.\n\n\nDual inhibitors of cathepsin S and K are particularly useful for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases which exhibit significant damage and remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and chronic pain. The compounds of the invention are particularly useful in the treatment of the above disorders.\n\n\nPreferred features for each aspect of the invention are as for each other aspect \nmutatis mutandis. \n \n\n\nAdministration\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be adapted for rectal, nasal, intrabronchial, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial and intradermal), intraperitoneal or intrathecal administration. Preferably the formulation is an orally administered formulation. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, i.e., in the form of discrete portions containing a unit dose, or a multiple or sub-unit of a unit dose. By way of example, the formulations may be in the form of tablets and sustained release capsules, and may be prepared by any method well known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\nFormulations for oral administration in the present invention may be presented as: discrete units such as capsules, gellules, drops, cachets, pills or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent; as a powder or granules; as a solution, emulsion or a suspension of the active agent in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion; or as a bolus etc. Preferably, these compositions contain from 1 to 250 mg and more preferably from 10-100 mg, of active ingredient per dose.\n\n\nFor compositions for oral administration (e.g. tablets and capsules), the term “acceptable carrier” includes vehicles such as common excipients e.g. binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, polyvinylpyrrolidone (Povidone), methylcellulose, ethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sucrose and starch; fillers and carriers, for example corn starch, gelatin, lactose, sucrose, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, dicalcium phosphate, sodium chloride and alginic acid; and lubricants such as magnesium stearate, sodium stearate and other metallic stearates, glycerol stearate stearic acid, silicone fluid, talc waxes, oils and colloidal silica. Flavouring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, cherry flavouring and the like can also be used. It may be desirable to add a colouring agent to make the dosage form readily identifiable. Tablets may also be coated by methods well known in the art.\n\n\nA tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active agent in a free flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface-active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may be optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active agent.\n\n\nOther formulations suitable for oral administration include lozenges comprising the active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active agent in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active agent in a suitable liquid carrier.\n\n\nOther forms of administration comprise solutions or emulsions which may be injected intravenously, intraarterially, intrathecally, subcutaneously, intradermally, intraperitoneally or intramuscularly, and which are prepared from sterile or sterilisable solutions. Injectable forms typically contain between 10-1000 mg, preferably between 10-250 mg, of active ingredient per dose.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be in form of suppositories, pessaries, suspensions, emulsions, lotions, ointments, creams, gels, sprays, solutions or dusting powders.\n\n\nAn alternative means of transdermal administration is by use of a skin patch. For example, the active ingredient can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin. The active ingredient can also be incorporated, at a concentration of between 1 and 10% by weight, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilisers and preservatives as may be required.\n\n\nDosage\n\n\nA person of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine an appropriate dose of one of the instant compositions to administer to a subject without undue experimentation. Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the individual undergoing therapy. The dosages disclosed herein are exemplary of the average case. There can of course be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nIn accordance with this invention, an effective amount of a compound of general formula (I) may be administered to inhibit the proteinase implicated with a particular condition or disease. Of course, this dosage amount will further be modified according to the type of administration of the compound. For example, to achieve an “effective amount” for acute therapy, parenteral administration of a compound of general formula (I) is preferred. An intravenous infusion of the compound in 5% dextrose in water or normal saline, or a similar formulation with suitable excipients, is most effective, although an intramuscular bolus injection is also useful. Typically, the parenteral dose will be about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg; preferably between 0.1 and 20 mg/kg, in a manner to maintain the concentration of drug in the plasma at a concentration effective to inhibit a cysteine proteinase. The compounds may be administered one to four times daily at a level to achieve a total daily dose of about 0.4 to about 400 mg/kg/day. The precise amount of an inventive compound which is therapeutically effective, and the route by which such compound is best administered, is readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by comparing the blood level of the agent to the concentration required to have a therapeutic effect. Prodrugs of compounds of the present invention may be prepared by any suitable method. For those compounds in which the prodrug moiety is a ketone functionality, specifically ketals and/or hemiketals, the conversion may be effected in accordance with conventional methods.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention may also be administered orally to the patient, in a manner such that the concentration of drug is sufficient to inhibit bone resorption or to achieve any other therapeutic indication as disclosed herein. Typically, a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound is administered at an oral dose of between about 0.1 to about 50 mg/kg in a manner consistent with the condition of the patient. Preferably the oral dose would be about 0.5 to about 20 mg/kg.\n\n\nNo unacceptable toxicological effects are expected when compounds of the present invention are administered in accordance with the present invention. The compounds of this invention, which may have good bioavailability, may be tested in one of several biological assays to determine the concentration of a compound which is required to have a given pharmacological effect.\n\n\nCombinations\n\n\nIn a particularly preferred embodiment, the one or more compounds of the invention are administered in combination with one or more other active agents, for example, existing drugs available on the market. In such cases, the compounds of the invention may be administered consecutively, simultaneously or sequentially with the one or more other active agents.\n\n\nDrugs in general are more effective when used in combination. In particular, combination therapy is desirable in order to avoid an overlap of major toxicities, mechanism of action and resistance mechanism(s). Furthermore, it is also desirable to administer most drugs at their maximum tolerated doses with minimum time intervals between such doses. The major advantages of combining chemotherapeutic drugs are that it may promote additive or possible synergistic effects through biochemical interactions and also may decrease the emergence of resistance.\n\n\nBeneficial combinations may be suggested by studying the inhibitory activity of the test compounds with agents known or suspected of being valuable in the treatment of a particular disorder. This procedure can also be used to determine the order of administration of the agents, i.e. before, simultaneously, or after delivery. Such scheduling may be a feature of all the active agents identified herein.\n\n\nSynthesis\n\n\nSynthesis of 5,5-Bicyclic Core\n\n\nOne aspect of the invention relates to a process of preparing a compound of formula (I) as defined above, said process comprising oxidation of a compound of formula (II).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny suitable oxidising agent may be used to convert the secondary alcohol group of (II) into the corresponding ketone (I). Suitable oxidising agents will be familiar to the skilled artisan. By way of example, the oxidation may be carried out via a Dess-Martin periodinane reaction [Dess, D. B. et al, J. Org. Chem. 1983, 48, 4155; Dess, D. B. et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 7277], or via a Swern oxidation [Mancuso, A. J. et al, J. Org. Chem. 1978, 43, 2480]. Alternatively, the oxidation can be carried out using SO\n3\n/pyridine/Et\n3\nN/DMSO [Parith, J. R. et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967, 5505; U.S. Pat. No. 3,444,216, Parith, J. R. et al,], P\n2\nO\n5\n/DMSO or P\n2\nO\n5\n/Ac\n2\nO [Christensen, S. M. et al, Organic Process Research and Development, 2004, 8, 777]. Other alternative oxidation reagents include activated dimethyl sulphoxide [Mancuso, A. J., Swern, D. J., Synthesis, 1981, 165], pyridinium chlorochromate [Pianeatelli, G. et al, Sythesis, 1982, 245] and Jones' reagent [Vogel, A, I., Textbook of Organic Chemistry, 6\nth \nEdition].\n\n\nMore preferably, the process comprises treating a compound of formula (II) with Dess-Martin periodinane. Preferably, the reaction is carried out using dichloromethane as solvent.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment, the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (III) into a compound of formula (II) through standard amide bond formation between R\n9\nCONHCH(R\n3\n)COOH and the compound of formula (III; R\n5\n═H) with a suitable carboxylic acid activating agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere R\n5 \nis a protecting group or hydrogen.\n\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment, protecting group R\n5 \nis selected from benzyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl, 1-(biphenyl-4-yl)-1-methylethoxycarbonyl, α,α-dimethyl-3,5-dimethoxylbenzyloxycarbonyl, p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, allyloxycarbonyl and trichloroethoxycarbonyl.\n\n\nMore preferably, R\n5 \nis benzyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) or flouren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc).\n\n\nIn another preferred embodiment R\n5 \nis H.\n\n\nIn a more preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (IV) into a compound of formula (III; R\n5\n═H)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere Lg is a leaving group such as tosylate or mesylate and R\n5 \nis as previously defined.\n\n\n\nIn an even more preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (IVa; R\n5\n═H) into a compound of formula (IIIa) or a compound of formula (IVb; R\n5\n=Cbz) into a compound of formula (IIIb)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor compounds of formulae (IIIa) and (IIIb) the displacement of tosylate is typically performed using an excess of lithium chloride in DMF at 130° C. Displacement proceeds with inversion of configuration.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (V) into a compound of formula (IV)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore preferably the intra-molecular cyclisation of compound (V) is induced by removal of the protecting group R\n5\n. Preferably, for this embodiment, R\n5 \nis benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), and the process comprises hydrogenating a compound of formula (V) in the presence of a palladium catalyst.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (VI) into a compound of formula (V)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment, the oxidising agent is mCPBA.\n\n\nIn another preferred embodiment, the oxidising agent is a dioxirane.\n\n\nThe use of dioxiranes as oxidising agents is well documented in the literature [see (a) Hodgson, D. M. et al, Synlett, 310 (2002); (b) Adam, W. et al, Acc. Chem. Res. 22, 205, (1989); (c) Yang, D. et al, J. Org. Chem., 60, 3887, (1995); (d) Mello, R. et al, J. Org. Chem., 53, 3890, (1988); (e) Curci, R. et al, Pure & Appl. Chem., 67 (5), 811 (1995); (f) Emmons, W. D. et al, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 89, (1955)].\n\n\nPreferably, the dioxirane is generated in situ by the reaction of KHSO\n5 \nwith a ketone. However, the oxidation step can also be carried out using an isolated dioxirane, for example a stock solution of the dioxirane formed from acetone.\n\n\nMore preferably, the dioxirane is generated in situ using Oxone®, which is a commercially available oxidising agent containing KHSO\n5 \nas the active ingredient.\n\n\nThus, in one preferred embodiment, the claimed process involves the in situ epoxidation of a compound of formula (VI) using Oxone® (2KHSO\n5\n.KHSO\n4\n.K\n2\nSO\n4\n) and a ketone co-reactant.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, the active ingredient of Oxone® is potassium peroxymonosulfate, KHSO\n5 \n[CAS-RN 10058-23-8], commonly known as potassium monopersulfate, which is present as a component of a triple salt with the formula 2KHSO\n5\n.KHSO\n4\n.K\n2\nSO\n4 \n[potassium hydrogen peroxymonosulfate sulfate (5:3:2:2), CAS-RN 70693-62-8; commercially available from DuPont]. The oxidation potential of Oxone® is derived from its peracid chemistry; it is the first neutralization salt of peroxymonosulfuric acid H\n2\nSO\n5 \n(also known as Caro's acid).\n\n\nK\n+−\nO—S(═O)\n2\n(—OOH)\n\n\n\nPotassium Monopersulfate\n\n\nUnder slightly basic conditions (pH 7.5-8.0), persulfate reacts with the ketone co-reactant to form a three membered cyclic peroxide (a dioxirane) in which both oxygens are bonded to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. The cyclic peroxide so formed then epoxidises the compound of formula VI by syn specific oxygen transfer to the alkene bond.\n\n\nPreferably, the ketone is of formula (XIX)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\na \nand R\nb \nare each independently alkyl, aryl, haloalkyl or haloaryl.\n\n\n\nWhere R\na \nand/or R\nb \nare alkyl, the alkyl group may be a straight chain or branched alkyl group. Preferably, the alkyl group is a C\n1-20 \nalkyl group, more preferably a C\n1-15\n, more preferably still a C\n1-12 \nalkyl group, more preferably still, a C\n1-8 \nor C\n1-6 \nalkyl group, more preferably a C\n1-4 \nalkyl group. Particularly preferred alkyl groups include, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl and hexyl.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “haloalkyl” refers to an alkyl group as described above in which one or more hydrogens are replaced by halo.\n\n\nWhere R\na \nand/or R\nb \nare aryl, the aryl group is typically a C\n6-12 \naromatic group. Preferred examples include phenyl and naphthyl etc.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “haloaryl” refers to an aryl group as described above in which one or more hydrogens are replaced by halo.\n\n\nBy way of example, the reaction of KHSO\n5 \n(Oxone®) with a ketone of formula XVI would form a dioxirane of formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\na \nand R\nb \nare as defined above.\n\n\n\nMore preferably, R\na \nand R\nb \nare each independently alkyl or haloalkyl.\n\n\nIn a highly preferred embodiment, at least one of R\na \nand R\nb \nis a haloalkyl, more preferably, CF\n3 \nor CF\n2\nCF\n3\n.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment, R\na \nand R\nb \nare each independently methyl or trifluoromethyl.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment of the invention, the ketone is selected from acetone and a 1,1,1-trifluoroalkyl ketone.\n\n\nIn a more preferred embodiment of the invention, the trifluoroalkyl ketone is 1,1,1-trifluoroacetone or 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-butanone, more preferably 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-butanone.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (VII) into a compound of formula (VI)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferably the process comprises treating a compound of formula (VII) with tosyl chloride in pyridine. Alternatively the process comprises treating a compound of formula (VII) with tosyl chloride in dichloromethane and triethylamine.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment the process of the invention comprises the step of converting a compound of formula (VIII) into a compound of formula (VII)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwhere W is halogen or tosyl.\n\n\n\nPreferably, this step comprises the steps of:\n\n \n \n(a) reacting a compound of formula (VIII), where W is halogen or OTs, with aqueous ammonia and alcohol; and\n \n(b) converting the product formed in step (a) to a compound of formula (VII).\n \n\n\nPreferably, steps (a) and (b) of the above process are a one-pot process.\n\n\nIn one particularly preferred embodiment, R\n5 \nis benzyloxycarbonyl, and step (b) comprises treating the mixture formed in step (a) with benzyloxycarbonyl chloride.\n\n\nPreferably, W is I, Br or OTs, more preferably, Br or OTs, even more preferably OTs.\n\n\nPreferably, the alcohol is isopropyl alcohol or ethanol.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment of the invention, said compound of formula VIII is prepared from a compound of formula IX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferably, the above process comprises treating said compound of formula IX with methyl lithium.\n\n\nMore preferably, compound of formula IX is compound 47 and compound of formula VIII is compound 14. Treatment of monobromotosylate 47 with zinc dust at room temperature in organic/aqueous mixtures (most preferably an isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, water, ammonium chloride mixture) provides alcohol 14 respectively in high yield. Additionally, completion of the one-pot conversion gives alcohol VII and with defined stereochemistry and in high yield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommencing from the commercially available sugar isosorbide, the present invention also provides facile preparation of monobromotosylate 47. One highly preferred preparation is shown below in Scheme 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsosorbide (43) is converted to the di-tosylate (42) which is obtained following recrystallisation from methanol in 97% yield. Mono-bromination is effected by 2.5 eq lithium bromide in DMSO (or DMF) with temperature control 110° C.→120° C. The product bromide is isolated following extractive work-up and purification either by column chromatography (74%) or attractive for large scale by recrystallisation from methanol giving a first crop of 55% plus mother liquors containing good quality material that may be pooled from batch runs and purified later. Thus, preparation of monobromotosylate (47) with defined stereochemistry by methods in Scheme 15 is attractive for large scale applications. Treatment of monobromotosylate (47) with zinc dust at room temperature in organic/aqueous mixtures (most preferably an isopropanol, tetrahydrofuran, water, ammonium chloride mixture) provides alcohol (14) which is derivatised as the Cbz compound (18) through one pot conversion.\n\n\nIn one highly preferred embodiment of the invention, the 6-Cl-5,5-bicylic core is prepared in accordance with the steps set forth in Scheme 1 below:\n\n\nThe alcohol functionality of (18) may be derivatised as the para-toluene sulphonate (Ts) giving (R)-2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-1-((S)-2,5-dihydrofuran-2-yl)ethyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate (32b) which proceeds through the anti-epoxide (R)-2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-1-((1S,2S,5S)-3,6-dioxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-yl)ethyl 4-methylbenzenesulphonate (33b). Hydrogenation of tosylate (33b) provides free amine that undergoes intramolecular cyclisation to provide intermediate (74). Intermediate (74) undergoes displacement with an excess of lithium chloride in DMF at 130° C., to give the 6-chloro analogue with inversion of configuration. Urethane protection of the secondary amine of the bicyclic intermediate (69) followed by oxidation to ketone provides intermediate (71) that is particularly useful for solid phase synthesis of compounds of general formula I.\n\n\nAdvantageously, the epoxidation to give the desired anti-epoxide is directed by the presence of the tosylate group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, intermediate tosylate (74) may be Cbz protected to give protected analogue (34b) that may undergo inversion to chloride (68) through treatment with LiBr in DMF at typically 130° C. (Scheme 1).\n\n\nSynthesis of Compounds of Formula (I)\n\n\nTo those skilled in the practices of organic chemistry, compounds of general formula (I) may be readily synthesised by a number of chemical strategies, performed either in solution or on the solid phase (see Atherton, E. and Sheppard, R. C. In ‘\nSolid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach\n’, Oxford University Press, Oxford, U.K. 1989, for a general review of solid phase synthesis principles), or a combination thereof.\n\n\nCompounds of general formula (I) may be conveniently considered as a combination of three building blocks (P1, P2 and P3) that respectively occupy the S1, S2 and S3 binding sites of the protease (see Berger, A. and Schechter, I., \nPhilos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. [Biol.], \n257, 249-264, 1970 for a description of the designation of enzyme S-subsites and substrate P-subsites within enzyme-substrate or enzyme-inhibitor complexes). The notional concepts of P1, P2 and P3 are used herein for convenience only and the above-mentioned compounds are intended to be within the scope of the invention regardless of binding mode.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA suitably protected and/or activated building block may then be prepared and subsequently chemically bonded (coupled) together with other building blocks to provide compounds of general formula (I).\n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) may be prepared: (1) by the stepwise addition of P3 and P2 to the bicyclic 6-(S)-chlorotetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one core; or (2) by reaction of the bicyclic 6-(S)-chlorotetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one core with a P3-P2 prescursor molecule; or (3) by introducing the P3-P2 group prior to formation of the bicyclic 6-(S)-chlorotetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one core, i.e. prior to the oxidation step or prior to the intramolecular cyclisation step.\n\n\nThus, alternative orders of coupling of the building blocks are possible, for example P2+P1→P2-P1 then addition of P3→P3-P2-P1 or P3+P2→P3-P2 then addition to P1→P3-P2-P1. Within each of these combinations each of the P1, P2 or P3 building blocks may contain additional alternative functionalities that are further transformed following coupling to give the final compound. For example the ketone functionality of the P1 building block may be protected as a ketal during coupling of building blocks and transformed to the final ketone by hydrolysis following completion of the coupling reactions. Alternatively, the ketone functionality of the P1 building block may be initially introduced via a lower oxidation state such as the corresponding alcohol and following completion of the coupling reactions be re-introduced by oxidation of the alcohol. Alternatively, the ketone functionality of the P1 building block may be protected through a semi-carbazone suitable for solid phase synthesis (e.g. see WO 02/057270 and references cited therein) and following completion of the coupling reactions released from the solid phase by acidolytic reaction.\n\n\nThe chemical bond formed by coupling of the building blocks is a secondary amide (P3-P2) or a tertiary amide (P2-P1) that is formed through reaction of an activated carboxylic acid with a primary and secondary amine respectively. Many methods are available for activation of a carboxylic acid prior to coupling to an amine and in principle, any of these methods may be used herein. Typical carboxylic acid activation methods are exemplified but not restricted to the azide method, mixed anhydride method (e.g. via isobutylchloroformate), carbodiimide methods (e.g. via dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3-(3′-dimethylamino propyl)carbodiimide), active ester method (e.g. via p-nitrophenyl ester, N-hydroxysuccinic imido ester, pentafluorophenyl ester), uronium method (e.g. via addition of HBTU, PyBop, BOP), carbonyldiimidazole method or via pre-formation of acyl fluorides or acyl chlorides. In some instances the coupling reaction may be enhanced by the addition of a further activation catalyst such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, or 4-dimethylaminopyridine. A general description of carboxylic acid activation techniques and the use of activation additives may be found in Bodanszky, M. ‘Principles of Peptide Synthesis’, 2\nnd \nrev. ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1993 and references cited therein.\n\n\nThe α-amino group of the P2 amino acid building block is usually protected during coupling reactions to the P1 building block to avoid the formation of undesired self-condensation products. The art of α-amino protection is well known in peptide chemistry (e.g. see Bodanszky, M. ‘Principles of Peptide Synthesis’, 2\nnd \nrev. ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1993 and references cited therein) and example protection groups include, but are not limited to, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc) and trichloroethoxycarbonyl (Treoc). The Fmoc group is particularly well suited for solid phase syntheses (e.g. see Atherton, E.; Sheppard, R. C. in ‘Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis A Practical Approach’, IRL Press, Oxford, U.K., 1989) typically being removed by treatment with 20% v/v piperidine in dimethylformamide or 1% v/v 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene in dimethylformamide. The Boc group is particularly well suited to solution phase syntheses typically being removed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid based mixtures or HCl in dioxane or ethyl acetate. The Cbz group is also particularly well suited for solution phase syntheses typically being removed by catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen and palladium catalysis or by treatment with HBr in acetic acid. Once the coupling sequence is complete, any protecting groups are removed in whatever manner is dictated by the choice of protecting groups (for a general description of protecting groups and their respective stabilities and methods of removal see Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M. ‘Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis’ John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1991 and references therein).\n\n\nIn the simplest example, the entire left hand portion of a compound of general formula (I) (i.e. P3-P2) as the carboxylic acid can be prepared in solution by traditional organic chemistry methods and coupled to ketone, alcohol or ketal intermediates such as compounds (IIb), (IIc) and (IId). Then oxidation of the alcohol intermediate (e.g. Dess-Martin periodinane in DCM) or acidolytic cleavage of the ketal intermediate provides compounds of general formula (I). The alcohol oxidation route is particularly useful when the compound of general formula (I) contains a substituent that is labile to trifluoroacetic acid, this being the final reagent used in each of the solid phase syntheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of these different coupling tactics have been detailed previously (see (i) Quibell, M. et. al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. \n13, 609-625, 2005. (ii) Wang, Y. et. al., \nBioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. \n15, 1327-1331, 2005) and the optimum synthetic route is dependant upon the specific substituent combinations of the target compound of general formula (I).\n\n\nIn more detail, one preferred strategy for the synthesis of compounds of general formula (I) comprises:—\n\n \n \n(a) Preparation of an appropriately functionalised and protected bicyclic ketone or bicyclic alcohol building block in solution;\n \n(b) Attachment of the building block (a) to the solid phase through a linker that is stable to the conditions of synthesis, but readily labile to cleavage at the end of a synthesis (see James, I. W., \nTetrahedron, \n55 (\nReport N\n \n \no\n \n489), 4855-4946, 1999, for examples of the ‘linker’ function as applied to solid phase synthesis);\n \n(c) Solid phase organic chemistry (see Brown, R. D. \nJ. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. \n1, 19, 3293-3320, 1998), to construct the remainder of the molecule;\n \n(d) Compound cleavage from the solid phase into solution; and\n \n(e) Cleavage work-up and compound analysis.\n \n\n\nA second strategy for the synthesis of compounds of general formula (I) comprises:—\n\n \n \n(a) Preparation of an appropriately functionalised and protected bicyclic intermediate building block in solution. Preferred protecting groups for solution phase chemistry are the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), Nα-tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), Nα-benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and Nα-allyloxycarbonyl group (Alloc).\n \n(b) Standard organic chemistry methods for the conversion of building block obtained in step (a) towards compounds of general formula (I).\n \n\n\nAs mentioned above, in one preferred embodiment of the invention, compounds of formula (I) may be prepared using conventional solution phase chemistry, for example, as described in Quibell, M et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 13, 609-625, 2005 (see in particular, Schemes 3 and 4). The solution phase strategy is attractive in being able to generate larger quantities of preferred analogues, typically on a multi-gram to multi-kilogram scale.\n\n\nIn an alternative preferred embodiment of the invention, compounds of formula (I) may be prepared using conventional solid phase chemistry, for example, as described in Quibell M, et al Bioorg. Med. Chem., 12, 5689-5710, 2004, see in particular, Scheme 3 and Section 3.2, and references cited therein; and Bioorg. Med. Chem., 13, 609-625, 2005, see Scheme 5 and Section 2.2, and references cited therein). The solid phase strategy is attractive in being able to generate many thousands of analogues, typically on a 5-100 mg scale, through established parallel synthesis methodologies (e.g. see (a) Bastos, M.; Maeji, N. J.; Abeles, R. H. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n92, 6738-6742, 1995).\n\n\nThe synthetic strategy is based on reversible anchorage of the ketone functionality via a hydrazide linker bond using general multipin techniques previously described in the art (Watts J. et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 12 (11), 2903, 2004; Quibell M., et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. 5689-5710, 2004; Grabowksa U. et al, J. Comb. Chem. 2000, 2 (5), 475).\n\n\nCompounds of formula (III; R\n5\n=Fmoc) may be oxidised to the corresponding ketone (e.g. XVI, Scheme 3) and utilised in a solid phase synthesis of inhibitor molecules (I). The solid phase linkage of an aldehyde or ketone, has previously been described by a variety of methods (e.g. see (a) James, I. W., 1999, (b) Lee, A., Huang, L., Ellman, J. A., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc, \n121 (43), 9907-9914, 1999, (c) Murphy, A. M., et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 114, 3156-3157, 1992). A suitable method amenable to the reversible linkage of an alkyl ketone functionality is through a combination of the previously described chemistries. The semicarbazide, 4-[[(hydrazinocarbonyl)amino]methyl]cyclohexane carboxylic acid. trifluoroacetate (Murphy, A. M., et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 114, 3156-3157, 1992), may be utilised as illustrated in Scheme 3, exemplified by linkage of the Fmoc protected 6-(S)-chlorotetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one (71).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruct (XVII) is prepared through reaction of the linker molecule and the 6-(S)-chlorotetrahydrofuro[3,2-b]pyrrol-3-one (71) by refluxing in aqueous ethanol/sodium acetate. Standard solid phase techniques (e.g. see Atherton, E. and Sheppard, R. C., 1989) are used to anchor the construct to an amino-functionalised solid phase through the free carboxylic acid functionality of (XVII), providing the loaded construct (XVIII). Loaded construct (XVIII) be reacted with a wide range of carboxylic acids available commercially or in the literature, to introduce the left-hand portion ‘P3-P2’.\n\n\nPreferred carboxylic acids for the introduction of the [R\n9\n—CO] synthon are known in the literature with the following representative examples; furan-2-carboxylic acid, 5-chlorofuran-2-carboxylic acid, thiophene-2-carboxylic acid, 5-chlorothiophene-2-carboxylic acid, furan-3-carboxylic acid, 5-chlorofuran-3-carboxylic acid, thiophene-3-carboxylic acid, 5-chlorothiophene-3-carboxylic acid, oxazole-2-carboxylic acid, oxazole-5-carboxylic acid, 1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-carboxylic acid, thiazole-2-carboxylic acid, thiazole-5-carboxylic acid, 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-carboxylic acid, benzoic acid, 3-methylbenzoic acid, 3-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-fluorobenzoic acid, 3-bromobenzoic acid, 3-methoxybenzoic acid, 3-nitrobenzoic acid, 3,5-difluorobenzoic acid, nicotinic acid (CAS 59-67-6), 5-fluoronicotinic acid, 5-chloronicotinic acid, 5-methoxynicotinic acid, 5-nitronicotinic acid, pyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid (CAS 4595-61-3), isonicotinic acid, 2-fluoroisonicotinic acid, 3-(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 61471-45-2), 3-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 264264-33-7), 3-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 108035-47-8), 3-(1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 335255-82-8), 3-(4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 335255-80-6), 3-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 167626-64-4), 3-(1H-tetrazol-1-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 204196-80-5), 3-(2H-1,2,3-triazol-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 90556-58-4), 3-(1H-imidazol-5-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 912569-71-2), 3-(1H-imidazol-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 391668-62-5), 3-(4H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 876715-37-6), 3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 73096-39-6), 3-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 850375-11-0), 3-(furan-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 35461-99-5), 3-(thiophen-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 29886-63-3), 3-(isoxazol-5-yl)benzoic acid (852180-44-0), 3-(isothiazol-5-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 904085-98-9), 3-(oxazol-5-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 252928-82-8), 3-(thiazol-5-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 252928-84-0), 3-(oxazol-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 473538-18-0), 3-(thiazol-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 847956-27-8), 3-(furan-3-yl)benzoic acid, (CAS 168619-07-6), 3-(thiophen-3-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 20608-89-3), 3-(2-methylthiazol-4-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 28077-41-0), 3-(1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 912577-30-1), 3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 915707-39-0), 3-(2-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 898289-59-3), 3-(3-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 915707-45-8), 3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 628297-55-2), 3-(pyridin-4-yl)benzoic acid, 3-(pyrimidin-4-yl)benzoic acid, 3-(pyridin-3-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 4385-77-7), 3-(pyrimidin-5-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 852180-74-6), 3-(pyridin-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 4467-07-6), 3-(pyrimidin-2-yl)benzoic acid (CAS 579476-26-9), benzo[d]thiazole-6-carboxylic acid (3622-35-3), 1H-indole-5-carboxylic acid (1670-81-1), 1H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole-6-carboxylic acid (23814-12-2), benzo[d][1,2,5]oxadiazole-5-carboxylic acid (19155-88-5), 6-hydroxypicolinic acid (19621-92-2), 2,3-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoxaline-6-carboxylic acid, 2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-6-carboxylic acid (CAS 70639-77-9), 2-oxoindoline-5-carboxylic acid (CAS 102359-00-2), 2-oxoindoline-6-carboxylic acid (CAS 334952-09-9), 2,3-dioxoindoline-5-carboxylic acid (CAS 25128-32-9), 3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazine-7-carboxylic acid (CAS 214848-62-1), 4-(methylsulfonamido)benzoic acid (CAS 7151-76-0), 2-oxo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[b]azepine-7-carboxylic acid (CAS 117030-69-0).\n\n\nThe present invention is further described by way of example.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nGeneral Procedures\n\n\nSolvents were purchased from ROMIL Ltd, U.K. at SpS or Hi-Dry grade unless otherwise stated. \n1\nH NMR and \n13\nC NMR were obtained on a Bruker DPX400 (400 MHz \n1\nH frequency and 100 MHz \n13\nC frequency; QXI probe) or Bruker Avance 500 MHz (TXI probe with ATM) in the solvents indicated.

The data from these types of assays enables compound potency and the rates of reaction to be measured and quantified. This information, either alone or in combination with other information, would allow the amount of compound required to produce a given pharmacological effect to be determined.\n\n\nIn Vitro Cathepsin Ki Inhibition Measurements\n\n\nStock solutions of substrate or inhibitor were made up to 10 mM in 100% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (Rathburns, Glasgow, U.K.) and diluted as appropriately required. In all cases the DMSO concentration in the assays was maintained at less than 1% (vol./vol.). The equilibrium inhibition constants (K\ni\n \nss\n) for each compound were measured under steady-state conditions monitoring enzyme activity as a function of inhibitor concentration. The values were calculated on the assumption of pure competitive behaviour (Cornish-Bowden, A. \nFundamentals of enzyme kinetics \nPortland Press; 1995, 93-128).\n\n\nHuman recombinant cathepsin K (0.25 nM final; B. Turk, Josef, Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia), was routinely assayed in 100 mM sodium acetate; pH 5.5 containing 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM L-cysteine and 1.8 μM Z-Leu-Arg-AMC ([S]=K\nM\n).\n\n\nHuman recombinant cathepsin S (0.25 nM final, Merck, \nE. coli \ncat #219343) was routinely assayed in 10 mM Bis Tris Propane; pH 6.5 containing 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM β mercaptoethanol, 1 mM CaCl\n2 \nand 45 μM Boc-Val-leu-Lys-AMC ([S]=K\nM\n) (Sigma Chemical Company, Poole, U.K.).\n\n\nHuman liver cathepsin B (0.25 nM final; Merck Biosciences), was routinely assayed in 10 mM bis-tris propane; pH 6.5 containing 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM CaCl\n2 \nand 60 μM Z-Phe-Arg-AMC ([S]=K\nM\n) (Bachem, Weil am Rhein, Germany).\n\n\nHuman recombinant cathepsin V (0.25 nM final, Merck Biosciences) was routinely assayed in 100 mM sodium acetate; pH 5.5 containing 10 mM L-cysteine, 0.001% (vol./vol.) zwittergent 3-12 (Merck Biosciences) and 5 μM Z-Leu-Arg-AMC (K\nM\n=0.5 μM) (Amura).\n\n\nHuman liver cathepsin L (0.25 nM final, Athens Research and Technology, GA, USA) was routinely assayed in 10 mM bis-tris propane; pH 6.5 containing 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM CaCl\n2 \nand 4 μM Ac-Phe-Arg-AMC ([S]=K\nM\n) (Bachem).\n\n\nMeasurement of the Apparent Macroscopic Binding (Michaelis) Constants (K\nM\n \napp\n) for Substrates\n\n\nThe apparent macroscopic binding constant (K\nM\n \napp\n) for each substrate was calculated, from the dependence of enzyme activity as a function of substrate concentration. The observed rates were plotted on the ordinate against the related substrate concentration on the abscissa and the data fitted by direct regression analysis (Prism v 3.02; GraphPad, San Diego, USA) using Equation 1 (Cornish-Bowden, A. \nFundamentals of enzyme kinetics \nPortland Press; 1995, 93-128).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\n\n\ni\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nmax\n\n\napp\n\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\no\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\nS\n\n\no\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nM\n\n\napp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Equation 1 ‘v\ni\n’ is the observed initial rate, ‘V\nmax\n \napp\n’ is the observed maximum activity at saturating substrate concentration, ‘K\nM\n \napp\n’ is the apparent macroscopic binding (Michaelis) constant for the substrate, ‘[S\no\n]’ is the initial substrate concentration.\n\n\nMeasurement of the Inhibition Constants\n\n\nThe apparent inhibition constant (K\ni\n) for each compound was determined on the basis that inhibition was reversible and occurred by a pure-competitive mechanism.

All liver microsome incubations were carried out in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, with a final microsomal protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Compounds were taken from 5 mM DMSO stock solutions and diluted in incubation buffer to give a final concentration of 25 μM, with a final DMSO concentration of 0.5% v/v. In brief, compounds were added to the incubation buffer along with the liver microsomes and incubated at 37° C. for 10 minutes. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of NADPH, previously dissolved in incubation buffer, to give a final concentration of 1 mM and re-incubated at 37° C. Aliquots were removed at 2 and 60 minutes and quenched with an equal volume of cold acetonitrile. After mixing vigorously, the precipitated protein matter was removed by filtration (Multiscreen Solvinert filter plates, Millipore, Bedford, Mass., USA) and the filtrate analysed by reverse phase HPLC with mass spectrometric detection, using single ion monitoring of the [M+H]\n+\n species. Metabolic turnover was determined by comparison of peak areas from the ion chromatograms of the parent compound at 2 and 60 minutes and expressed as percent remaining at 1 hour.\n\n\nPlasma Incubations:\n\n\nHuman and rat plasma were purchased from Innovative Research Inc.

The plates were then capped and mixed vigorously for 1 hour on a microtitre plate shaker, after which they were left to stand, allowing the PBS and octanol phases to separate. The PBS layer was analysed by reverse phase HPLC with mass spectrometric detection, using single ion monitoring of the [M+H]\n+\n species. LogD\n(PBS) \nwas determined by comparison of the peak area from the ion chromatogram of the compound in the PBS phase with that of a 50 μM standard of the same compound dissolved in acetonitrile/water (50:50) and calculated using the following formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nLog\n\n\n⁡\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAUCstd\n\n\n-\n\n\nAUCpbs\n\n\n\n\nAUCpbs\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere AUCstd and AUCpbs are the peak areas from the standard and test ion chromatograms respectively.

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application is a Continuation-In-Part Application of U.S. Ser. No. 10/310,150, filed Dec. 5, 2002, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,547,728, which claims the benefit of Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/336,185, filed Dec. 6, 2001, which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.\n\n\nFIELD OF INVENTION\n\n\nThis invention relates to the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting disorders. More particularly, this invention relates to a method of treating, preventing, suppressing, inhibiting, or reducing the incidence of muscle wasting in a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder, by administering to the subject a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) compound and/or its analog, derivative, isomer, metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate, N-oxide, prodrug, polymorph, impurity or crystal, or any combination thereof.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nMuscle wasting refers to the progressive loss of muscle mass and/or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles, including the skeletal or voluntary muscles, which control movement, cardiac muscles, which control the heart (cardiomyopathics), and smooth muscles. Chronic muscle wasting is a chronic condition (i.e. persisting over a long period of time) characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass, weakening and degeneration of muscle.\n\n\nThe loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein degradation by catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation, an unusually low rate of protein synthesis, or a combination of both. Muscle protein catabolism, whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis, leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting.\n\n\nMuscle wasting is associated with chronic, neurological, genetic or infectious pathologies, diseases, illnesses or conditions. These include Muscular Dystrophies such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Myotonic Dystrophy; Muscle Atrophies such as Post-Polio Muscle Atrophy (PPMA); Cachexias such as Cardiac Cachexia, AIDS Cachexia and Cancer Cachexia, malnutrition, Leprosy, Diabetes, Renal Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cancer, end stage Renal failure, Sarcopenia, Emphysema, Osteomalacia, HIV Infection, AIDS, and Cardiomyopathy.\n\n\nIn addition, other circumstances and conditions are linked to and can cause muscle wasting. These include chronic lower back pain, advanced age, central nervous system (CNS) injury, peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury, chemical injury, central nervous system (CNS) damage, peripheral nerve damage, spinal cord damage, chemical damage, burns, disuse deconditioning that occurs when a limb is immobilized, long term hospitalization due to illness or injury, and alcoholism.\n\n\nAn intact androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway is crucial for appropriate development of skeletal muscles. Furthermore, an intact AR-signalling pathway increases lean muscle mass, muscle strength and muscle protein synthesis.\n\n\nMuscle wasting, if left unabated, can have dire health consequences. For example, the changes that occur during muscle wasting can lead to a weakened physical state that is detrimental to an individual's health, resulting in increased susceptibility to infraction and poor performance status. In addition, muscle wasting is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from cachexia and AIDS. Innovative approaches are urgently needed at both the basic science and clinical levels to prevent and treat muscle wasting, in particular chronic muscle wasting. The present invention is directed to satisfying this need.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThis invention provides: 1) a method of treating a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder; 2) a method of preventing a muscle wasting disorder in a subject; 3) a method of treating, preventing, suppressing, inhibiting or reducing muscle loss in a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder; 4) a method of treating, preventing, inhibiting, reducing or suppressing muscle wasting in a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder;

The term “pharmaceutical product” means a composition suitable for pharmaceutical use (pharmaceutical composition), as defined herein.\n\n\nBiological Activity of Selective Androgen Modulator Compounds\n\n\nAs contemplated herein, the SARM compounds of the present invention as useful in treating, preventing, suppressing, inhibiting or reducing the incidence of muscle wasting disorders, as defined herein. An intact androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway is crucial for appropriate development of skeletal muscles. Furthermore, an intact AR-signalling pathway increases lean muscle mass, muscle strength and muscle protein synthesis.\n\n\nA muscle is a tissue of the body that primarily functions as a source of power. There are three types of muscles in the body: a) skeletal muscle—the muscle responsible for moving extremities and external areas of the bodies; b) cardiac muscle—the heart muscle; and c) smooth muscle—the muscle that is in the walls of arteries and bowel.\n\n\nA wasting condition or disorder is defined herein as a condition or disorder that is characterized, at least in part, by an abnormal, progressive loss of body, organ or tissue mass. A wasting condition can occur as a result of a pathology such as, for example, cancer, or it can be due to a physiologic or metabolic state, such as disuse deconditioning that can occur, for example, due to prolonged bed rest or when a limb is immobilized, such as in a cast. A wasting condition can also be age associated. The loss of body mass that occurs during a wasting condition can be characterized by a loss of total body weight, or a loss of organ weight such as a loss of bone or muscle mass due to a decrease in tissue protein.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, “muscle wasting” or “muscular wasting”, used herein interchangeably, refer to the progressive loss of muscle mass and/or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles, including the skeletal or voluntary muscles which control movement, cardiac muscles which control the heart, and smooth muscles. In one embodiment, the muscle wasting condition or disorder is a chronic muscle wasting condition or disorder. “Chronic muscle wasting” is defined herein as the chronic (i.e. persisting over a long period of time) progressive loss of muscle mass and/or to the chronic progressive weakening and degeneration of muscle.\n\n\nThe loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein breakdown or degradation, by muscle protein catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation, an unusually low rate of protein synthesis, or a combination of both. Protein catabolism or depletion, whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis, leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting. The term “catabolism” has its commonly known meaning in the art, specifically an energy burning form of metabolism.\n\n\nMuscle wasting can occur as a result of a pathology, disease, condition or disorder. In one embodiment, the pathology, illness, disease or condition is chronic. In another embodiment, the pathology, illness, disease or condition is genetic. In another embodiment, the pathology, illness, disease or condition is neurological. In another embodiment, the pathology, illness, disease or condition is infectious. As described herein, the pathologies, diseases, conditions or disorders for which the compounds and compositions of the present invention are administered are those that directly or indirectly produce a wasting (i.e. loss) of muscle mass, that is a muscle wasting disorder.\n\n\nThese include but are not limited to Muscular Dystrophies; Muscle Atrophies; Cachexias; malnutrition, Leprosy, Diabetes, Renal Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cancer, end stage Renal failure, Sarcopenia, Emphysema, Osteomalacia, HIV Infection, AIDS, or Cardiomyopathy.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the muscle wasting disorder is due to an infectious disease such as enterovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes zoster, HIV, trypanosomiasis, influenze, coxsacke, infectious mononucleosis, Rickettsia, Trichinella, or Schistosomiasis.\n\n\nThe muscular dystrophies are genetic diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal or voluntary muscles that control movement. The muscles of the heart and some other involuntary muscles are also affected in some forms of muscular dystrophy. The major forms of Muscular Dystrophy are: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Becker Muscular Dystrophy, Limbgirdle Muscular Dystrophy, Facioscapulhumeral Muscular Dystrophy, Congenital Muscular Dystrophy, Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy, Distal Muscular Dystrophy and Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy.\n\n\nMuscular Dystrophy can affect people of all ages. Although some forms first become apparent in infancy or childhood, others may not appear until middle age or later. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is the most common kind of Muscular Dystrophy affecting children. Myotonic Dystrophy is the most common of these diseases in adults.\n\n\nMuscle Atrophy is characterized by wasting away or diminution of muscle and a decrease in muscle mass. For example, Post-Polio Muscular Atrophy is a muscle wasting that occurs as part of the Post-Polio Syndrome (PPS). The Atrophy includes weakness, muscle fatigue, and pain.\n\n\nAnother type of Muscular Atrophy is X-linked spinal-bulbar Muscular Atrophy (SBMA—also known as Kennedy's Disease). This disease arises from a defect in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome, affects only males, and its onset is in adulthood. Because the primary disease cause is an androgen receptor mutation, androgen replacement is nota current therapeutic strategy. There are some investigational studies where exogenous testosterone propionate is being given to boost the levels of androgen with hopes of overcoming androgen insensitivity and perhaps provide an anabolic effect. Still, use of supraphysiological levels of testosterone for supplementation will have limitations and other potentially serious complications.\n\n\nCachexia is weakness and a loss of weight caused by a disease or as a side effect of illness. Cardiac Cachexia, i.e. a muscle protein wasting of both the cardiac and skeletal muscle, is a characteristic of congestive heart failure. Cancer Cachexia is a syndrome that occurs in patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies and is manifested by weight loss with massive depletion of both adipose tissue and lean muscle mass. Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Cachexia is a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) associated myopathy and/or muscle weakness/wasting that is a relatively common clinical manifestation of AIDS. Individuals with HIV-associated myopathy or muscle weakness or wasting typically experience significant weight loss, generalized or proximal muscle weakness, tenderness, and muscle atrophy.\n\n\nSarcopenia is a debilitating disease that afflicts the elderly and chronically ill patients and is characterized by loss of muscle mass and function. Further, increased lean body mass is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality for certain muscle-wasting disorders. In addition, other circumstances and conditions are linked to, and can cause muscle wasting disorders. For example, studies have shown that in severe cases of chronic lower back pain, there is paraspinal muscle wasting.\n\n\nMuscle wasting is also associated with advanced age. It is believed that general weakness in old age is due to muscle wasting. As the body ages, an increasing proportion of skeletal muscle is replaced by fibrous tissue. The result is a significant reduction in muscle power, performance and endurance.\n\n\nLong term hospitalization due to illness or injury, or disuse deconditioning that occurs, for example, when a limb is immobilized, can also lead to muscle wasting. Studies have shown that in patients suffering injuries, chronic illnesses, burns, trauma or cancer, who are hospitalized for long periods of time, there is a long-lasting unilateral muscle wasting, with a consequent decrease in body mass.\n\n\nInjuries or damage to the Central Nervous System (CNS) are also associated with muscle wasting disorders. Injuries or damage to the CNS can be, for example, caused by diseases, trauma or chemicals. Examples are central nerve injury or damage, peripheral nerve injury or damage and spinal cord injury or damage.\n\n\nFinally, alcoholism has been shown to be associated with muscle wasting disorders.\n\n\nAs contemplated herein, this invention provides a class of compounds which are Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM) compounds. These compounds, which are useful in preventing and treating muscle wasting disorders are classified as androgen receptor agonists (AR agonists), partial agonists or androgen receptor antagonists (AR antagonists).\n\n\nA receptor agonist is a substance which binds receptors and activates them. A receptor partial agonist is a substance which binds receptor and partially activate them. A receptor antagonist is a substance which binds receptors and inactivates them. As demonstrated herein, the SARM compounds of the present invention have a tissue-selective effect, wherein one agent may be an agonist, partial agonist and/or antagonist, depending on the tissue. For example, the SARM compound may stimulate muscle tissue and at the same time inhibit prostate tissue. In one embodiment, the SARMs which are useful in treating and preventing muscle wasting disorders are AR agonists, and are, therefore, useful in binding to and activating the AR. In another embodiment, the SARMs are AR antagonists, and are, therefore, useful in binding to and inactivating the AR. Assays to determine whether the compounds of the present invention are AR agonists or antagonists are well known to a person skilled in the art. For example, AR agonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to maintain and/or stimulate the growth of AR containing tissue such as prostate and seminal vesicles, as measured by weight. AR antagonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds inhibit the growth of AR containing tissue.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention can be classified as partial AR agonist/antagonists. The SARMs are AR agonists in some tissues, to cause increased transcription of AR-responsive genes (e.g. muscle anabolic effect). In other tissues, these compounds serve as competitive inhibitors of testosterone/DHT on the AR to prevent agonistic effects of the native androgens.\n\n\nThe SARM compounds of the present invention bind either reversibly or irreversibly to the androgen receptor. In one embodiment, the SARM compounds bind reversibly to the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the SARM compounds bind irreversibly to the androgen receptor. The compounds of the present invention may contain a functional group (affinity label) that allows alkylation of the androgen receptor (i.e. covalent bond formation). Thus, in this case, the compounds bind irreversibly to the receptor and, accordingly, cannot be displaced by a steroid, such as the endogenous ligands DHT and testosterone.\n\n\nThe present invention provides a safe and effective method for treating, preventing, suppressing, inhibiting or reducing loss of muscle and/or muscle protein catabolism due to muscle wasting and is particularly useful for treating a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder. In one embodiment, the subject is a mammalian subject. In another embodiment, the subject is a human subject. In another embodiment, the subject is a male subject. In another embodiment, the subject is a female subject.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThis invention provides the use of a composition and a pharmaceutical composition for treating a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder; for preventing a muscle wasting disorder; for treating, preventing, suppressing, inhibiting or reducing muscle loss in a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder; for treating, preventing, inhibiting, reducing or suppressing muscle wasting in a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder; and for treating, preventing, inhibiting, reducing or suppressing muscle protein catabolism in a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder by administering a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) and/or its analog, derivative, isomer, metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate, N-oxide, or any combination thereof; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\nAs used herein, “pharmaceutical composition” means a “therapeutically effective amount” of the active ingredient, i.e. the SARM compound, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.

Suitable liquid formulations include solutions, suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oils and the like. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intravenously, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intravenous administration. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intraarterially, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intraarterial administration. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intramuscularly, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intramuscular administration.\n\n\nFurther, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered topically to body surfaces, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for topical administration. Suitable topical formulations include gels, ointments, creams, lotions, drops and the like. For topical administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are prepared and applied as solutions, suspensions, or emulsions in a physiologically acceptable diluent with or without a pharmaceutical carrier.\n\n\nFurther, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered as a suppository, for example a rectal suppository or a urethral suppository. Further, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered by subcutaneous implantation of a pellet. In a further embodiment, the pellet provides for controlled release of SARM agent over a period of time.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the active compound can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, \nScience \n249:1527-1533 (1990); Treat et al., in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327; see generally ibid).\n\n\nAs used herein “pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents” are well known to those skilled in the art. The carrier or diluent may be a solid carrier or diluent for solid formulations, a liquid carrier or diluent for liquid formulations, or mixtures thereof.\n\n\nSolid carriers/diluents include, but are not limited to, a gum, a starch (e.g. corn starch, pregeletanized starch), a sugar (e.g., lactose, mannitol, sucrose, dextrose), a cellulosic material (e.g. microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose), a cyclodextrin, an acrylate (e.g. polymethylacrylate), calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide, talc, or mixtures thereof.\n\n\nFor liquid formulations, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions or oils. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Examples of oils are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, and fish-liver oil.\n\n\nParenteral vehicles (for subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, or intramuscular injection) include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's and fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers such as those based on Ringer's dextrose, and the like. Examples are sterile liquids such as water and oils, with or without the addition of a surfactant and other pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants. In general, water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, and glycols such as propylene glycols or polyethylene glycol are preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Examples of oils are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, and fish-liver oil.\n\n\nIn addition, the compositions may further comprise binders (e.g. acacia, cornstarch, gelatin, carbomer, ethyl cellulose, guar gum, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, povidone), disintegrating agents (e.g. cornstarch, potato starch, alginic acid, silicon dioxide, croscarmelose sodium, crospovidone, guar gum, sodium starch glycolate), buffers (e.g., Tris-HCl., acetate, phosphate) of various pH and ionic strength, additives such as albumin or gelatin to prevent absorption to surfaces, detergents (e.g., Tween 20, Tween 80, Pluronic F68, bile acid salts), protease inhibitors, surfactants (e.g. sodium lauryl sulfate), permeation enhancers, solubilizing agents (e.g., glycerol, polyethylene glycerol), anti-oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite, butylated hydroxyanisole), stabilizers (e.g. hydroxypropyl cellulose, hyroxypropylmethyl cellulose), viscosity increasing agents (e.g. carbomer, colloidal silicon dioxide, ethyl cellulose, guar gum), sweetners (e.g. aspartame, citric acid), preservatives (e.g., Thimerosal, benzyl alcohol, parabens), lubricants (e.g. stearic acid, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate), flow-aids (e.g. colloidal silicon dioxide), plasticizers (e.g. diethyl phthalate, triethyl citrate), emulsifiers (e.g. carbomer, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate), polymer coatings (e.g., poloxamers or poloxamines), coating and film forming agents (e.g. ethyl cellulose, acrylates, polymethacrylates) and/or adjuvants.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are controlled release compositions, i.e. compositions in which the SARM compound is released over a period of time after administration. Controlled or sustained release compositions include formulation in lipophilic depots (e.g. fatty acids, waxes, oils). In another embodiment, the composition is an immediate release composition, i.e. a composition in which all of the SARM compound is released immediately after administration.\n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. For example, the agent may be administered using intravenous infusion, an implantable osmotic pump, a transdermal patch, liposomes, or other modes of administration. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. \nBiomed. Eng. \n14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980); Saudek et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n321:574 (1989). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity to the therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., Goodson, in \nMedical Applications of Controlled Release\n, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer (\nScience \n249:1527-1533 (1990).\n\n\nThe compositions may also include incorporation of the active material into or onto particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polglycolic acid, hydrogels, etc, or onto liposomes, microemulsions, micelles, unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles, erythrocyte ghosts, or spheroplasts.) Such compositions will influence the physical state, solubility, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance.\n\n\nAlso comprehended by the invention are particulate compositions coated with polymers (e.g. poloxamers or poloxamines) and the compound coupled to antibodies directed against tissue-specific receptors, ligands or antigens or coupled to ligands of tissue-specific receptors.\n\n\nAlso comprehended by the invention are compounds modified by the covalent attachment of water-soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol, copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyproline. The modified compounds are known to exhibit substantially longer half-lives in blood following intravenous injection than do the corresponding unmodified compounds (Abuchowski et al., 1981; Newmark et al., 1982; and Katre et al., 1987). Such modifications may also increase the compound's solubility in aqueous solution, eliminate aggregation, enhance the physical and chemical stability of the compound, and greatly reduce the immunogenicity and reactivity of the compound. As a result, the desired in vivo biological activity may be achieved by the administration of such polymer-compound abducts less frequently or in lower doses than with the unmodified compound.\n\n\nThe preparation of pharmaceutical compositions which contain an active component is well understood in the art, for example by mixing, granulating, or tablet-forming processes. The active therapeutic ingredient is often mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient. For oral administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are mixed with additives customary for this purpose, such as vehicles, stabilizers, or inert diluents, and converted by customary methods into suitable forms for administration, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard or soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. For parenteral administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are converted into a solution, suspension, or emulsion, if desired with the substances customary and suitable for this purpose, for example, solubilizers or other.\n\n\nAn active component can be formulated into the composition as neutralized pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide or antibody molecule), which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, mandelic, and the like. Salts formed from the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, and the like.\n\n\nFor use in medicine, the salts of the SARM will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of the compounds according to the invention or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic: acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid.\n\n\nAs defined herein, “contacting” means that the SARM compound of the present invention is introduced into a sample containing the enzyme in a test tube, flask, tissue culture, chip, array, plate, microplate, capillary, or the like, and incubated at a temperature and time sufficient to permit binding of the SARM to the enzyme. Methods for contacting the samples with the SARM or other specific binding components are known to those skilled in the art and may be selected depending on the type of assay protocol to be run. Incubation methods are also standard and are known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the term “contacting” means that the SARM compound of the present invention is introduced into a subject receiving treatment, and the SARM compound is allowed to come in contact with the androgen receptor in vivo.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “treating” includes preventative as well as disorder remitative treatment.

They should in no way be construed, however, as limiting the broad scope of the invention.\n\n\nExperimental Details Section\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nEffect of Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMS) and Testosterone on Skeletal Muscles in Intact Female Rats\n\n\nCompound V (N-[4-nitro-3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-(2S)-3-[4-(acetylamino)phenoxy]-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide), is a selective androgen receptor modulator represented by the formula:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound V is a ligand for AR with potent binding affinity, exhibits tissue-selective androgenic and anabolic effects, and is orally bioavailable. Compound V is a powerful anabolic agent that maintains the mass of the levator ani in castrated male rats.\n\n\nMyosin heavy chain (MHC) is the predominant protein in skeletal muscle encoded by a multigene family expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner [Adams G. R., Zeng S. A., Baldwin K. M. \nAm. J. Physiol. \n276:R954-R961, 1999]. To further demonstrate the importance of compound V in muscle, the effects of this nonsteroidal anabolic agent directly in skeletal muscle by monitoring the expression of MHC subtypes using RT-PCR has been demonstrated. In steady state, mRNA expression usually parallels the pattern of MHC protein expression. Because transcription of MHC mRNA occurs in advance of MHC protein translation, and the increased sensitivity of RT-PCR compared to western blotting, rapid changes in mRNA expression can be detected and used to analyze the subtle dynamic effects of muscle anabolism [Wright C., Haddad F., Qin A. X., Baldwin K. M. \nJ. Appl. Phys. \n83 (4):1389-1396, 1997].\n\n\nMethods:\n\n\nRat muscle tissue was harvested in 5 volumes of RNA later solution (Ambion, cat. #7020) and stored at 4° C. until used for RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated in the FastPrep FP120 instrument (Qbiogene) using RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion, cat #1914) in combination with FastRNA green tubes (Qbiogene, cat. #6040-600) at settings for time at45 sec and speed at 6.5. 1 ug of total RNA was used for reverse transcription using Retroscript kit (Ambion, cat #1710). The mixture was incubated at 42° C. for 60 min, followed by 10 min at 92° C., and then chilled on ice and used in PCR reaction.\n\n\nRelatively quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze expression of MHC mRNA in rat musculus masseter (MM) and levator ani (LA). As an internal standard 18S ribosomal RNA was used (QuantumRNA classic 18S Internal Standard, Ambion, cat. #1716). Linear range of PCR reaction for all primers as well as optimal ratio of 18S primers to competitors to achieve the same level of amplification as the genes of interest was determined.\n\n\nPrimers were obtained from IDT based on the recently published design (Wright et al., \nJ. Appl. Phys. \n1997; 83:1389), with the following sequence:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′GAAGGCCAAGAAGGCCATC3′\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo design a perfect match of upstream primers for the neonatal sequence, slight modifications of the above common primer was necessary (Table 1). The optimal annealing temperature of these degenerate common primers was, however, unchanged, and they were used in the same manner as the common primer as 5′-oligonucleotides for PCR reactions. The 3′-oligonucleotides used in the PCR reactions were designed from the 3′-untranslated regions of each of the different MHC genes, where the sequences are highly specific for each MHC gene [Wright et al 1997]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOligonucleotide primers used for PCR amplification\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreactions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMHC\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nsubtype\n\n\nCommon Primer\n\n\nAntisense Primer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIIb\n\n\n5′GAAGGCCAAGAAGGCCATC3′\n\n\n5′GTGTGATTTCTTCTGTCACC3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 1)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIIx\n\n\n5′GAAGGCCAAGAAGGCCATC3′\n\n\n5′GGTCACTTTCCTGCTTTGGA3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 1)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nneonatal\n\n\n5′GAAGGCCAAGAAGGCCATC3′\n\n\n5′GCGGCCTCCTCAAGATGCGT3′\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 1)\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche, cat#1146165), 200 μM of each dNTP (Invitrogen, cat. #R725-01), 0.2 μM each MHC primer (IDT), 1 μl of cDNA from reverse transcription reaction and 4 μl of 18S primers: competitors mixture were used in 50 μl PCR reaction. Amplification was carried out in PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research, Inc.) with an initial denaturation step of 3 min at 94° C., followed by optimized number of cycles for the MHC primer pair, with each cycle consisting of 45 sec at 94° C., 60 sec at 48° C., 90 sec 72° C., and a final step of 5 min at 72° C. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis [20-μl aliquots of a 50-μl PCR reaction loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel (in lx Tris-Acetate-EDTA buffer) containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide] to visualize the PCR products. Gels were photographed under ultraviolet (UV) light using Polaroid instant film number 57 to generate an image of the gel. Pictures were scanned and the volume of the optical density (OD) of a DNA band was determined by the Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics), and the background was subtracted (so local background was directly proportional to the amount of DNA over a wide range). Intensity (volume of the OD) of the MHC band was divided by the intensity of the control fragment, thereby correcting for any differences in the efficiency of the PCR reactions. The content of each experimental group MHC gene was calculated as a percentage of the MHC value in the control group (Table 2).\n\n\nResults:\n\n\nThe masseter muscle dissected from untreated intact female rats was set as the control level (representing 100%) of MHC IIb expression (see histogram in \nFIG. 1\n \na\n). Intact female rats treated with androgens were evaluated against the untreated controls for the effect of treatment on MHC IIb from masseter. The results indicate that testosterone propionate has a positive effect on masseter muscle where it increased transcription of MCH type IIb to 142% of untreated control (\nFIG. 1\n \nb\n). Compound V was found to have a similar effect where it increased level of MHC IIb transcript to 124% (\nFIG. 1\n \nb\n). Actual untransformed data (PCR results) is shown in \nFIG. 1\n \na. \n \n\n\nIn these same rats, the levator ani was dissected and evaluated for the expression pattern of MHC family members. The data indicate that all animals treated with androgens (TP or Compound V) for a period of 14- and 28-days had a muscle present in the location expected for the levator ani, and further characterization of this tissue by RT-PCR demonstrates presence of MHC type IIb and very little expression of MHC subtypes IIx and the neonatal isoform. The SDS-PAGE as well as immunoblotting with a MHC type II specific antibody revealed a single band of apparent molecular weight of about 200 kDa. These results are consistent with the presence of a levator ani muscle [Talmadge R. J. and Roy R. R. \nJ. Appl. Physiol. \n75(5): 2337-2340, 1993].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntensity of the bands resolved on agarose gel expressed as\n\n\n\n\n\n\naverage intensity of all pixels in the spot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTreatment\n\n\n18 S\n\n\nII b\n\n\nII b/18 S\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nControl\n\n\n102\n\n\n46\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTP\n\n\n141\n\n\n90\n\n\n0.64\n\n\n141.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompound V\n\n\n171\n\n\n96\n\n\n0.56\n\n\n124.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a similar experiment with masseter muscle and gastrocnemius muscle, the masseter and gastrocnemius muscles dissected from untreated intact male rats were set as the control level (representing 100%) of MHC IIb expression (\nFIG. 2\n). Intact male rats treated with androgens were evaluated against the untreated controls for the effect of treatment on MHC IIb from masseter or gastrocnemius. The results indicate that testosterone propionate has a positive effect on masseter muscle where it increased transcription of MHC type IIb to 120(±14)% of untreated control (FIG. \n2\n—Top). Compound V was also anabolic in muscle, with an increase in MHC type IIb to 117(±13)% (FIG. \n2\n—Top). In gastrocnemius muscle, similar results were observed. Testosterone propionate has a positive effect on gastrocnemius muscle where it increased transcription of MHC type IIb to 139(±47)% of untreated control (FIG. \n2\n—Bottom). Compound V was also anabolic in muscle, with an increase in MHC type IIb to 162(±54)% (FIG. \n2\n—Bottom).\n\n\nConclusions:\n\n\nThese results demonstrate that both the selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) as exemplified by compound V and TP have direct anabolic effects on the musculoskeletal system in intact female and male rats as measured by a net increase in the expression of mRNA for MHC. Additionally, treatment with these anabolic agents for a period of 14- and 28-days resulted in muscular hypertrophy of the levator ani. Testosterone has been recognized as an anabolic androgen for several decades. It has been demonstrated herein, that the selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) as exemplified by Compound V is an orally bioavailable nonsteroidal agent with tissue selective anabolic effects in male rats and which increases muscle mass. The selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) as described hereinabove, can be used to treat among other diseases or conditions' catabolic syndromes of sarcopenia associated with aging or chronic illness, and sexual dysfunction in females.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nPharmacologic Activity and Tissue-Selectivity of Compounds V and VI in Rats of Varying Hormonal Status\n\n\nCompound V is a potent and efficacious selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) in castrated male rats. To provide a representative model of the vast majority of men that will eventually receive this drug, Applicants completed a preclinical study to compare the pharmacologic effects and tissue-selectivity of Compound V, Compound VI—another potent SARM, and testosterone propionate (TP) in male rats of varying hormonal status. Male rats with normal testicular function (i.e., intact with no surgical manipulation) were included to examine the effects of Compound V on animals with normal blood levels of testosterone. Male rats that received unilateral orchidectomy (i.e., surgical removal of one testis) were included to examine the effects of Compound V on animals with slight androgen depletion. Male rats that received bilateral orchidectomy (i.e., surgical removal of both testes) were included to examine the effects of Compounds V and VI on androgen-deficient animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nMethods:\n\n\n\nCompounds V and VI were synthesized and characterized in the laboratory of Dr. Duane Miller at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tenn. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan Biosciences (Indianapolis, Ind.). The animals were maintained on a 12-h cycle of light and dark with food and water available ad libitum. All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University, and conformed to the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH publication #85-23, revised 1985). Immature male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 187 to 214 g were randomly distributed into 9 groups of 5 animals. One day before the initiation of drug treatment, groups 4 through 6 and groups 7 through 9 received unilateral or bilateral orchidectomy, respectively, via a midline scrotal incision. \nGroups\n 1 through 3 did not undergo surgery. All drugs given to animals were freshly prepared as solutions in polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG 300). Groups 4 and 7 received treatment with vehicle alone (i.e., PEG 300). Animals in \n \ngroups\n \n 3, 6, and 9 received testosterone propionate (TP, 0.5 mg/day) via implantation of subdermal osmotic pumps (Model 2002, Durect Corporation, Palo Alto, Calif.). Animals in \n \ngroups\n \n 2, 5, and 8 received Compound V or Compound VI (0.5 mg/day) via implantation of subdermal osmotic pumps. After 14 days of drug treatment, rats were weighed, anesthetized, and sacrificed. The ventral prostates, seminal vesicles, and levator ani muscle were removed and weighed. Osmotic pumps were also removed from animals to check for correct pump operation. The weights of all organs were normalized to body weight, and analyzed for any statistically significant differences between groups using single-factor ANOVA with the alpha value set a priori at p<0.05. The weights of prostates and seminal vesicles were used as indices for evaluation of androgenic activity, and the levator ani muscle weight was used to evaluate the anabolic activity. Statistical analyses of parameters from complete blood count or serum chemical profiling, wherever applicable, were performed by single-factor ANOVA with the alpha value set a priori at p<0.05.\n\n\nResults:\n\n\nAs shown in Table 3 and \nFIG. 3\n, in intact animals, Compound V decreased the size of the prostate to 79% and, of that observed in control animals (\nFIG. 3A\n), with no statistically significant changes in the size of the seminal vesicles (\nFIG. 3B\n) or levator ani muscle (\nFIG. 3C\n). The pharmacologic effects and tissue selectivity of Compound V were more obvious in hemi-orchidectomized animals (Table 3 and \nFIG. 4\n). Compound V decreased the size of the prostate (\nFIG. 4A\n) and seminal vesicles (\nFIG. 4B\n) to 75% and 79%, respectively, and increased the size of the levator ani muscle (\nFIG. 4C\n) to 108% of that observed in untreated hemi-orchidectomized animals. These observations demonstrate that Compound V acts as a partial agonist in prostate and seminal vesicles and as a full agonist in levator ani muscle. No adverse pharmacologic effects were observed. Similarly, as shown in Table 3 and in \nFIGS. 5 and 6\n, in castrated animals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of androgenic and anabolic effects of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound V and TP on intact, hemi-orchidectomized and castrated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrats (% of intact control, n = 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCompound V\n\n\nTP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrgans\n\n\nControl\n\n\n(0.5 mg/day)\n\n\n(0.5 mg/day)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProstate\n\n\nIntact\n\n\n100.00 ± 13.13\n\n\n 79.41 ± 9.32*\n†\n \n\n\n 97.45 ± 10.82\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHemi-\n\n\n 86.42 ± 19.52\n\n\n 74.69 ± 8.44*\n†\n \n\n\n 98.57 ± 7.98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCastrated\n\n\n 7.19 ± 1.25\n\n\n 32.55 ± 11.65*\n†‡\n \n\n\n 76.78 ± 10.43*\n‡\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeminal\n\n\nIntact\n\n\n100.00 ± 18.84\n\n\n 90.54 ± 12.10\n\n\n103.95 ± 13.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVesicle\n\n\nHemi-\n\n\n102.93 ± 7.47\n\n\n 78.55 ± 13.58\n†‡\n \n\n\n114.19 ± 23.81\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCastrated\n\n\n 8.97 ± 1.23\n\n\n 16.47 ± 5.21*\n†‡\n \n\n\n 63.48 ± 17.05*\n‡\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevator Ani\n\n\nIntact\n\n\n100.00 ± 12.69\n\n\n109.15 ± 14.68\n\n\n 95.61 ± 9.34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHemi-\n\n\n 92.94 ± 7.83\n\n\n108.10 ± 8.92\n‡\n \n\n\n 98.63 ± 10.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCastrated\n\n\n 42.74 ± 5.22\n\n\n100.65 ± 10.86\n‡\n \n\n\n 87.27 ± 10.25\n‡\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*p < 0.05 compared to intact control group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n†\np < 0.05 compared to TP of same surgical status (i.e., intact, hemi-orchidectomized, or castrate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n‡\np < 0.05 compared to control group of same surgical status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA comparison of the androgenic and anabolic activities of Compound V and Compound VI is provided in Table 4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 2.

Compound V led to significant decreases in prostate weights in intact and hemi-orchidectomized animals, and was less effective than TP at increasing the weight of the prostate in castrated animals. Similar pharmacologic effects were noted in the seminal vesicles (another organ generally considered as a marker of androgenic effects), with the exception that Compound V had no effect on the weight of the seminal vesicles in intact animals. Compound V treatment led to significant increases in the weight of the levator ani muscle in hemi-orchidectomized and castrated animals. These effects were greater than those observed with TP. These data demonstrate the tissue-selective pharmacologic effects of Compound V. It is important to note that these effects were observed in the absence of any significant changes in plasma concentrations of FSH, LH and testosterone (not shown).

Compounds VI-IX all had an anabolic effect, increasing the weight of the levator ani muscle in a dose-dependent manner. Compounds VI, VIII and IX (\nFIGS. 7A\n, C and D, respectively) increased the weight of the levator ani muscle to values close to those of the intact controls. The effect of compound VII (\nFIG. 7B\n) was even more pronounced—increasing the weight of the levator ani muscle to values exceeding those of intact controls. There were no statistically significant changes in the sizes of the prostate or seminal vesicles.

A group of sham-operated male rats was also included as intact control. The ORX animals (279-324 g) were randomly distributed into groups of 7 or 8 animals. Animals were maintained for 12 weeks after orchidectomy and were then treated with S-4 (3 or 10 mg/kg), DHT (3 mg/kg), or vehicle for 8 weeks. The intact animals were also treated with vehicle during the treatment period. The dosage was adjusted weekly based on animals' body weights. The drugs were dissolved in DMSO:PEG300 (20:80, v:v) and administered via daily subcutaneous injections. At the end of treatment, animals were weighed, anesthetized, and sacrificed within 8 hours after the last dose. The soleus muscle from the left rear leg was dissected immediately and was used for muscle strength measurements. The androgenic (ventral prostate and seminal vesicle) and anabolic tissues (levator ani muscle), and the soleus muscle from the right rear leg were removed and weighed. Blood samples were collected and used for the measurement of serum markers, including IGF-I and osteocalcin, using commercially available EIA kits. Statistical analyses of all the parameters were performed by single-factor ANOVA with the alpha value set a priori at p<0.05.\n\n\nMuscle Contractile Force Measurement: The soleus muscle was isolated and then mounted in the experimental chamber. The muscle was perfused in oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) Krebs-Ringer solution at room temperature (20-25° C.). The proximal tendon was attached to a rigid post, and the distal tendon was attached to a Kulite BG1000 transducer (Kulite Semiconductor Products, Inc., Leonia, N.J.) with 4.0 silk. The muscle was stimulated using a Grass S48 Stimulator (Quincy, Mass.) through two platinum field electrodes attached to the chamber walls. The output from the transducer was recorded using ASI Dynamic Muscle Control and Analysis Software from Aurora Scientific Inc. (Aurora, Canada). A force—tension curve was obtained by stimulating the muscle at supermaximal voltage (10 Volts) for 2 ms while stretching the muscle in 1 mm increments. Once the optimal length of the muscle (L0, muscle length at which maximal twitch tension was achieved) was identified, maximal tetanic tension (P0), time to peak twitch tension (tPt), and time to one half relaxation (t½R) were measured at L0.\n\n\nPeak twitch tension was elicited with supermaximal voltage (10 Volts) as square-wave pulses of 2 ms duration delivered at 0.1 Hz frequency. Sixteen continuous twitches were recorded, and one out of every three twitches was analyzed. The average of five measurements for each parameter was reported for each muscle sample. Tetanus was evoked with 3.0-s trains of stimuli at 2 ms duration and 40 Hz frequency. Three tetani were obtained for each muscle, the average of three measurements of P0 was reported. After the measurements, the soleus muscle was weighed, and the cross sectional area (CSA) of the muscle was estimated using the following equation:\n\n\nCSA (mm2)=muscle mass (mg)/[muscle optimal length (mm)×muscle density (mg/mm\n3\n)]\n\n\n\nMuscle density was assumed to be 1 mg/mm\n3 \nin rat skeletal muscle. Contractile force measurements were normalized to the CSA of the muscle prior to statistical comparison.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nAs demonstrated in \nFIG. 10\n, Compound V is able to restore soleus muscle strength in ORX rats. Twelve weeks after ORX, animals were treated with vehicle, Compound V (3 or 10 mg/kg), or DHT (3 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. Data are presented as mean±SD. \nFIG. 10\n A shows the peak titanic tension. \nFIG. 10B\n shows P0/CSA. As demonstrated, Compound V and DHT treatments restored ORX-caused loss in P0 and P0/CSA. The normalized soleus muscle weights and CSA of the muscle showed no significant difference between treatment groups (Not shown). In addition Compound V and DHT treatments did not cause significant changes in contraction kinetics of twitch or tetanus (not shown).\n\n\nThe data shows that Compound V shows a strong anabolic effect in skeletal muscle. Compound V restored soleus muscle strength without changing normalized muscle mass.\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\nCompound V Regulates MHC Isoform Expression in Cardiac Muscle but not in Soleus Muscle in ORX rats\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nThe castrated male rat model used in Example 6 was used for these experiments.\n\n\nElectrophoretic Separation of Skeletal and Cardiac Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC) Isoforms: Samples of the soleus and left ventricular muscle were homogenized in sample buffer. Dissolved samples were further diluted (1:10/v:v) with sample buffer before loading on the gel. An aliquot (3 μl) of each sample was loaded on each lane of the gel. For soleus muscle sample analysis, the stacking and separating gels (0.75 mm thick) consisted of 4 and 7% acrylamide (wt/vol), respectively, with acrylamide:bis-acrylamide ratio of 50:1. The stacking gel included 5% glycerol, and the separating gel included 30% glycerol. 2-Mercaptoethanol was added to the upper electrode buffer at a final concentration of 10 mM. Gels were run in a Hoefer SE600 unit (Hoefer Scientific, San Francisco, Calif.) at 8° C., with a constant voltage of 330 V for 23 hours. The ventricular sample analyses were conducted in a similar manner, except that the separating gel consisted of 6% acrylamide and 5% glycerol and the gels were run at 200 V for 20 hours. The gels were then fixed and silver-stained. The stained gels were analyzed using a GS 300 scanning densitometer (Hoefer Scientific).\n\n\nResults\n\n\nMHC isoform expression in soleus muscle (A) and cardiac ventricular muscle (B) (n=7-8) is shown in \nFIGS. 11A\n and B, respectively. Twelve weeks after ORX, animals were treated with vehicle, Compound V (3 or 10 mg/kg), or DHT (3 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. Data are presented as mean±SD. \nFIG. 11A\n shows that Compound V and DHT treatment did not affect MHC isoform expression in soleus muscle in ORX animals. \nFIG. 11B\n shows that ORX decreased MHC-α expression in ventricular muscle; Compound V and DHT treatments reversed the change.\n\n\nCardiac MHC-α expression was regulated by DHT and Compound V. However, MHC isoform expression in soleus muscle was not regulated by DHT or Compound V, suggesting that the increase in soleus muscle strength was not related to MHC isoform expression.\n\n\nIn summary, these data demonstrate that Compound V has great therapeutic potential in male hormone replacement therapy and the treatment of disease-related muscle wasting and osteoporosis.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art that the present invention is not limited by what has been particularly shown and described hereinabove. Rather, the scope of the invention is defined by the claims which follow:"
