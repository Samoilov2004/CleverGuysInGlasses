More specifically, the invention relates to the production, diagnostic use, and therapeutic use of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, and fragments thereof, which specifically bind Ang-2.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAngiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from existing ones, is essential to many physiological and pathological processes. Normally, angiogenesis is tightly regulated by pro- and anti-angiogenic factors, but in the case of diseases such as cancer, ocular neovascular diseases, arthritis, and psoriasis, the process can go awry. \nFolkman, J., Nat. Med., 1:27-31 (1995\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are a number of diseases known to be associated with deregulated or undesired angiogenesis. Such diseases include, but are not limited to, ocular neovascularisation, such as retinopathies (including diabetic retinopathy), age-related macular degeneration, psoriasis, hemangioblastoma, hemangioma, arteriosclerosis, inflammatory disease, such as a rheumatoid or rheumatic inflammatory disease, especially arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis), or other chronic inflammatory disorders, such as chronic asthma, arterial or post-transplantational atherosclerosis, endometriosis, and neoplastic diseases, for example so-called solid tumors and liquid (or hematopoietic) tumors (such as leukemias and lymphomas). Other diseases associated with undesired angiogenesis will be apparent to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough many signal transduction systems have been implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis, one of the best-characterized and most endothelial cell-selective systems involves the Tie-2 receptor tyrosine kinase (referred to as \"Tie-2\" or \"Tie-2R\" (also referred to as \"ORK\"); murine Tie-2 is also referred to as \"tek\") and its ligands, the angiopoietins (\nGale, N. W. and Yancopoulos, G. D., Genes Dev. 13:1055-1066 [1999\n]). There are 4 known angiopoietins; angiopoietin-1 (\"Ang-1\") through angiopoietin-4 (\"Ang-4\"). These angiopoietins are also referred to as \"Tie-2 ligands\". (\nDavis, S., et al., Cell, 87:1161-1169 [1996\n]; \nGrosios, K., et al., Cytogenet Cell Genet, 84:118-120 [1999\n]; \nHolash, J., et al., Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science, 42:1617-1625 [1999\n]; \nKoblizek, T. I., et al., Current Biology, 8:529-532 [1998\n]; \nLin, P., et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 95:8829-8834 [1998\n]; \nMaisonpierre, P. C., et al., Science, 277:55-60 [1997\n]; \nPapapetropoulos, A., et al., Lab Invest, 79:213-223 [1999\n]; \nSato, T. N., et al., Nature, 375:70-74 [1998\n]; \nShyu, K. G., et al., Circulation, 98:2081-2087 [1998\n]; \nSuri, C., et al., Cell, 87:1171-1180 [1996\n]; \nSuri, C., et al., Science, 282:468-471 [1998\n]; \nValenzuela, D. M., et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 96:1904-1909 [1999\n]; \nWitzenbichler, B., et al., J Biol Chem, 273:18514-18521 [1998\n]). Whereas Ang-1 binding to Tie-2 stimulates receptor phosphorylation in cultured endothelial cells, Ang-2 has been observed to both agonize and antagonize Tie-2 receptor phosphorylation (Davis, S., \net al.,\n [1996], \nsupra;\n Maisonpierre, P.C., \net al.,\n [1997], \nsupra;\n \nKim, I., J.H. Kim, et al., Oncogene 19(39): 4549-4552 (2000\n); \nTeichert-Kuliszewska, K., P.C. Maisonpierre, et al., Cardiovascular Research 49(3): 659-70 (2001\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phenotypes of mouse Tie-2 and Ang-1 knockouts are similar and suggest that Ang-1-stimulated Tie-2 phosphorylation mediates remodeling and stabilization of developing vessels \nin utero\n through maintenance of endothelial cell-support cell adhesion (\nDumont, D. J., et al., Genes & Development, 8:1897-1909 [1994\n]; \nSato, T. N., et al., Nature, 376:70-74 [1995\n]; Suri, C., \net al.,\n [1996], \nsupra\n). The role of Ang-1 in vessel stabilization is thought to be conserved in the adult, where it is expressed widely and constitutively (\nHanahan, D., Science, 277:48-50 [1997\n]; \nZagzag, D., et al., Experimental Neurology, 159:391-400 [1999\n]). In contrast, Ang-2 expression is primarily limited to sites of vascular remodeling, where it is thought to block Ang-1 function, thereby inducing a state of vascular plasticity conducive to angiogenesis (Hanahan, D., [1997], \nsupra;\n \nHolash, J., et al., Science, 284:1994-1998 [1999\n]; Maisonpierre, P. C., \net al.,\n [1997], \nsupra\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumerous published studies have purportedly demonstrated vessel-selective Ang-2 expression in disease states associated with angiogenesis. These pathological conditions include, for example, psoriasis, macular degeneration, and cancer (\nBunone, G., et al., American Journal of Pathology, 155:1967-1976 [1999\n]; \nEtoh, T., et al., Cancer Research, 61:2145-2153 [2001\n]; \nHangai, M., et al., Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science, 42:1617-1625 [2001\n]; Holash, J., \net al.,\n [1999] \nsupra;\n \nKuroda, K., et al., Journal of Investigative Dermatology, 116:713-720 [2001\n]; \nOtani, A., et al., Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science, 40:1912-1920 [1999\n]; \nStratmann, A., et al., American Journal of Pathology, 153:1459-1466 [1998\n]; \nTanaka, S., et al., J Clin Invest, 103:34-345 [1999\n]; \nYoshida, Y., et al., International Journal of Oncology, 15:1221-1225 [1999\n]; \nYuan, K., et al., Journal of Periodontal Research, 35:165-171 [2000\n]; Zagzag, D., \net al.,\n [1999] \nsupra\n). Most of these studies have focused on cancer, in which many tumor types appear to display vascular Ang-2 expression. In contrast with its expression in pathological angiogenesis, Ang-2 expression in normal tissues is extremely limited (Maisonpierre, P. C., \net al.,\n [1997], \nsupra;\n \nMezquita, J., et al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 260:492-498 [1999\n]). In the normal adult, the three main sites of angiogenesis are the ovary, placenta, and uterus; these are the primary tissues in normal (\ni.e\n., non-cancerous) tissues in which Ang-2 mRNA has been detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain functional studies suggest that Ang-2 may be involved in tumor angiogenesis. \nAhmad et al. (Cancer Res., 61:1255-1259 [2001\n]) describe Ang-2 over-expression and show that it is purportedly associated with an increase in tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. See also Etoh \net al., supra,\n and Tanaka \net al., supra,\n wherein data is presented purportedly associating Ang-2 over expression with tumor hypervascularity. However, in contrast, \nYu et al. (Am. J. Path., 158:563-570 [2001\n]) report data to show that overexpression of Ang-2 in Lewis lung carcinoma and TA3 mammary carcinoma cells purportedly prolonged the survival of mice injected with the corresponding transfectants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the past few years, various publications have suggested Ang-1, Ang-2 and/or Tie-2 as a possible target for anti-cancer therapy. For example, \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 6,166,185\n \n,\n \n 5,650,490\n \n, and\n \n 5,814,464\n \n each disclose the concept of anti-Tie-2 ligand antibodies and receptor bodies. \nLin et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 95:8829-8834 [1998\n]) injected an adenovirus expressing soluble Tie-2 into mice; the soluble Tie-2 purportedly decreased the number and size of the tumors developed by the mice. In a related study, \nLin et al (J. Clin. Invest., 100:2072-2078 [1997\n]) injected a soluble form of Tie-2 into rats; this compound purportedly reduced tumor size in the rats. \nSiemeister et al. (Cancer Res., 59:3185-3189 [1999\n]) generated human melanoma cell lines expressing the extracellular domain of Tie-2, injected these cell lines into nude mice, and concluded that soluble Tie-2 purportedly resulted in a \"significant inhibition\" of tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis. In view of this information, and given that both Ang-1 and Ang-2 bind to Tie-2, it is not clear from these studies whether Ang-1, Ang-2, or Tie-2 would be an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fusion of certain peptides to a stable plasma protein such as an Ig constant region to improve the half-life of these molecules has been described in, for example, \n \nPCT publication WO 00/24782, published May 4, 2000\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fusion of a protein or fragment thereof to a stable plasma protein such as an Ig constant region to improve the half-life of these molecules has been variously described (see, for example, \n \nU.S. Patent 5,480,981\n \n; \nZheng et al., J. Immunol., 154:5590-5600, (1995\n); \nFisher et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 334:1697-1702, (1996\n); \nVan Zee, K. et al., J.

Such therapy might have wider application in other angiogenesis-associated diseases as well, such as retinopathies, arthritis, and psoriasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is an undeveloped need to identify new agents that specifically recognize and bind Ang-2. Such agents would be useful for diagnostic screening and therapeutic intervention in disease states that are associated with Ang-2 activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide specific binding agents of Ang-2 that modulate Ang-2 activity.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides an antibody comprising a heavy chain and a light chain, wherein said heavy chain comprises a heavy chain variable region selected from the group consisting of 526 HC (SEQ ID NO. 1); 528 HC (SEQ ID NO. 3); 531 HC (SEQ ID NO. 5); 533 HC (SEQ ID NO. 7); 535 HC (SEQ ID NO. 9); 536 HC (SEQ ID NO. 11); 537 HC (SEQ ID NO. 13); 540 HC (SEQ ID NO. 15); 543 HC (SEQ ID NO. 17); 544 HC (SEQ ID NO. 19); 545 HC (SEQ ID NO. 21); 546 HC (SEQ ID NO. 23); 551 HC (SEQ ID NO. 25); 553 HC (SEQ ID NO. 27); 555 HC (SEQ ID NO. 29); 558 HC (SEQ ID NO. 31); 559 HC (SEQ ID NO. 33); 565 HC (SEQ ID NO. 35); F1-C6 HC (SEQ ID NO. 37); FB1-A7 HC (SEQ ID NO. 39); FD-B2 HC (SEQ ID NO. 41); FE-B7 HC (SEQ ID NO. 43); FJ-G11 HC (SEQ ID NO. 45); FK-E3 HC (SEQ ID NO. 47); G1D4 HC (SEQ ID NO. 49); GC1E8 HC (SEQ ID NO. 51); H1C12 HC (SEQ ID NO. 53); IA1-1E7 HC (SEQ ID NO. 55); IF-1C10 HC (SEQ ID NO. 57); IK-2E2 HC (SEQ ID NO. 59); IP-2C11 HC (SEQ ID NO. 61); and antigen binding fragments thereof; and said light chain comprises a light chain variable region selected from the group consisting of: 526 kappa (SEQ ID NO. 2); 536 kappa (SEQ ID NO. 12); 543 kappa (SEQ ID NO. 18); 544 kappa (SEQ ID NO. 20); 551 kappa (SEQ ID NO. 26); 553 kappa (SEQ ID NO. 28); 555 kappa (SEQ ID NO. 30); 558 kappa (SEQ ID NO. 32); 565 kappa (SEQ ID NO. 36); FE-B7 kappa (SEQ ID NO. 44); FJ-G 11 kappa (SEQ ID NO. 46); FK-E3 kappa (SEQ ID NO. 48); IA1-1E7 kappa (SEQ ID NO. 56); IP-2C11 kappa (SEQ ID NO. 62); 528 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 4); 531 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 6); 533 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 8); 535 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 10); 537 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 14); 540 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 16); 545 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 22); 546 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 24); 559 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 34); F1-C6 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 38); FB1-A7 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 40); FD-B2 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 42); G1D4 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 50); GC1E8 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 52); H1C12 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 54); IF-1C10 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 58); IK-2E2 lambda (SEQ ID NO. 60); and antigen binding fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides a specific binding agent comprising at least one peptide selected from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n \nSEQ ID NO. 1; SEQ ID NO. 3; SEQ ID NO. 5; SEQ ID NO. 7; SEQ ID NO. 9; SEQ ID NO. 11; SEQ ID NO. 13; SEQ ID NO. 15; SEQ ID NO. 17; SEQ ID NO. 19; SEQ ID NO. 21; SEQ ID NO. 23; SEQ ID NO. 25; SEQ ID NO. 27; SEQ ID NO. 29; SEQ ID NO. 31; SEQ ID NO. 33; SEQ ID NO. 35; SEQ ID NO. 37; SEQ ID NO. 39; SEQ ID NO. 41; SEQ ID NO. 43; SEQ ID NO. 45; SEQ ID NO. 47; SEQ ID NO. 49; SEQ ID NO. 51; SEQ ID NO. 53; SEQ ID NO. 55; SEQ ID NO. 57; SEQ ID NO. 59; SEQ ID NO. 61; SEQ ID NO. 2; SEQ ID NO. 12; SEQ ID NO. 18; SEQ ID NO. 20; SEQ ID NO. 26; SEQ ID NO. 28; SEQ ID NO. 30; SEQ ID NO. 32; SEQ ID NO. 36; SEQ ID NO. 44; SEQ ID NO. 46; SEQ ID NO. 48; SEQ ID NO. 56; SEQ ID NO. 62; SEQ ID NO. 4; SEQ ID NO. 6; SEQ ID NO. 8; SEQ ID NO. 10; SEQ ID NO. 14; SEQ ID NO. 16; SEQ ID NO. 22; SEQ ID NO. 24; SEQ ID NO. 34; SEQ ID NO. 38; SEQ ID NO. 40; SEQ ID NO. 42; SEQ ID NO. 50; SEQ ID NO. 52; SEQ ID NO. 54; SEQ ID NO. 58; and SEQ ID NO. 60, and fragments thereof.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that the specific binding agent can be, for example, an antibody, such as a polyclonal, monoclonal, chimeric, humanized, or a fully human antibody.

Details are described in the Examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe section headings are used herein for organizational purposes only, and are not to be construed as in any way limiting the subject matter described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStandard techniques may be used for recombinant DNA molecule, protein, and antibody production, as well as for tissue culture and cell transformation. Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are typically performed according to the manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art using conventional procedures such as those set forth in \nSambrook et al. (Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY [1989\n]), or as described herein. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclature utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques may be used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs utilized in accordance with the present disclosure, the following terms unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:\n\n \n \n \nThe term \"Ang-2\" refers to the polypeptide set forth in Figure 6 of \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,166,185\n \n (\"Tie-2 ligand-2\") or fragments thereof as well as related polypeptides which include allelic variants, splice variants, derivatives, substitution, deletions, and/or insertion variants, fusion peptides and polypeptides, and interspecies homologs. The Ang-2 polypeptide may or may not include additional terminal residues, e.g., leader sequences, targeting sequences, amino terminal methionine, amino terminal methionine and lysine residues, and/or tag or fusion proteins sequences, depending on the manner in which it is prepared.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe term \"biologically active\" when used in relation to Ang-2 or an Ang-2 specific binding agent refers to a peptide or polypeptide having at least one activity characteristic of Ang-2 or of an Ang-2 specific binding agent. A specific binding agent of Ang-2 may have agonist, antagonist, or neutralizing or blocking activity with respect to at least one biological activity of Ang-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"specific binding agent\" refers to a molecule, preferably a proteinaceous molecule, that binds Ang-2 (and variants and derivatives thereof as defined herein) with a greater affinity than other angiopoietins. A specific binding agent may be a protein, peptide, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, lipid, or small molecular weight compound which binds preferentially to Ang-2. In a preferred embodiment, the specific binding agent according to the present invention is an antibody, such as a polyclonal antibody, a monoclonal antibody (mAb), a chimeric antibody, a CDR-grafted antibody, a multi-specific antibody, a bi-specific antibody, a catalytic antibody, a humanized antibody, a human antibody, an anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibody, and antibodies that can be labeled in soluble or bound form, as well as fragments, variants or derivatives thereof, either alone or in combination with other amino acid sequences, provided by known techniques. Such techniques include, but are not limited to enzymatic cleavage, chemical cleavage, peptide synthesis or recombinant techniques. The anti-Ang-2 specific binding agents of the present invention are capable of binding portions of Ang-2 that modulate, e.g., inhibit or promote, the biological activity of Ang-2 and/or other Ang-2-associated activities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"polyclonal antibody\" refers to a heterogeneous mixture of antibodies that recognize and bind to different epitopes on the same antigen. Polyclonal antibodies may be obtained from crude serum preparations or may be purified using, for example, antigen affinity chromatography, or Protein A/Protein G affinity chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"monoclonal antibodies\" refers to a collection of antibodies encoded by the same nucleic acid molecule which are optionally produced by a single hybridoma or other cell line, or by a transgenic mammal such that each monoclonal antibody will typically recognize the same epitope on the antigen. The term \"monoclonal\" is not limited to any particular method for making the antibody, nor is the term limited to antibodies produced in a particular species, \ne.g\n., mouse, rat, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"chimeric antibodies\" refers to antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in an antibody derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is/are identical with or homologous to a corresponding sequence in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass. Also included are fragments of such antibodies, that exhibit the desired biological activity (i.e., the ability to specifically bind Ang-2). \nSee,\n \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,816,567\n \n and \nMorrison et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA), 81:6851-6855 [1985\n].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"CDR grafted antibody\" refers to an antibody in which the CDR from one antibody of a particular species or isotype is recombinantly inserted into the framework of another antibody of the same or different species or isotype.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"multi-specific antibody\" refers to an antibody having variable regions that recognize more than one epitope on one or more antigens. A subclass of this type of antibody is a \"bi-specific antibody\" which recognizes two distinct epitopes on the same or different antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Catalytic\" antibodies refers to antibodies wherein one or more cytotoxic, or more generally one or more biologically active, moieties are attached to the targeting binding agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"humanized antibody\" refers to a specific type of CDR-grafted antibody in which the antibody framework region is derived from a human but each CDR is replaced with that derived from another species, such as a murine CDR. The term \"CDR\" is defined \ninfra.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"fully human\" antibody refers to an antibody in which both the CDR and the framework are derived from one or more human DNA molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"anti-idiotype\" antibody refers to any antibody that specifically binds to another antibody that recognizes an antigen. Production of anti-idiotype antibodies can be performed by any of the methods described herein for production of an Ang-2-specific antibodies except that these antibodies arise from \ne.g\n., immunization of an animal with an Ang-2-specific antibody or Ang-2-binding fragment thereof, rather than Ang-2 polypeptide itself or a fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"variants,\" as used herein, include those polypeptides wherein amino acid residues are inserted into, deleted from and/or substituted into the naturally occurring (or at least a known) amino acid sequence for the binding agent. Variants of the invention include fusion proteins as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Derivatives\" include those binding agents that have been chemically modified in some manner distinct from insertion, deletion, or substitution variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Specifically binds Ang-2\" refers to the ability of a specific binding agent (such as an antibody or fragment thereof) of the present invention to recognize and bind mature, full-length or partial-length human Ang-2 polypeptide, or an ortholog thereof, such that its affinity (as determined by, \ne.g\n., Affinity ELISA or BIAcore assays as described herein) or its neutralization capability (as determined by \ne.g\n., Neutralization ELISA assays described herein, or similar assays) is at least 10 times as great, but optionally 50 times as great, 100, 250 or 500 times as great, or even at least 1000 times as great as the affinity or neutralization capability of the same for any other angiopoietin or other peptide or polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"antigen binding domain\" or \"antigen binding region\" refers to that portion of the specific binding agent (such as an antibody molecule) which contains the specific binding agent amino acid residues (or other moieties) that interact with an antigen and confer on the binding agent its specificity and affinity for the antigen. In an antibody, the antigen-binding domain is commonly referred to as the \"complementarity-determining region, or CDR.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"epitope\" refers to that portion of any molecule capable of being recognized by and bound by a specific binding agent, \ne.g\n. an antibody, at one or more of the binding agent's antigen binding regions. Epitopes usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules, such as for example, amino acids or carbohydrate side chains, and have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics as well as specific charge characteristics. Epitopes as used herein may be contiguous or non-contiguous. Moreover, epitopes may be mimetic in that they comprise a three dimensional structure that is identical to the epitope used to generate the antibody, yet comprise none or only some of the amino acid residues found in the Ang-2 used to stimulate the antibody immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"inhibiting and/or neutralizing epitope\" is an epitope, which when bound by a specific binding agent such as an antibody, results in the loss of (or at least the decrease in) biological activity of the molecule, cell, or organism containing such epitope, \nin vivo, in vitro,\n or \nin situ.\n In the context of the present invention, the neutralizing epitope is located on or is associated with a biologically active region of Ang-2. Alternatively, the term \"activating epitope\" is an epitope, which when bound by a specific binding agent of the invention, such as an antibody, results in activation, or at least maintenance of a biologically active conformation, of Ang-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"antibody fragment\" refers to a peptide or polypeptide which comprises less than a complete, intact antibody. Complete antibodies comprise two functionally independent parts or fragments: an antigen binding fragment known as \"Fab,\" and a carboxy terminal crystallizable fragment known as the \"Fc\" fragment. The Fab fragment includes the first constant domain from both the heavy and light chain (CH1 and CL1) together with the variable regions from both the heavy and light chains that bind the specific antigen. Each of the heavy and light chain variable regions includes three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework amino acid residues which separate the individual CDRs. The Fc region comprises the second and third heavy chain constant regions (CH2 and CH3) and is involved in effector functions such as complement activation and attack by phagocytic cells. In some antibodies, the Fc and Fab regions are separated by an antibody \"hinge region,\" and depending on how the full length antibody is proteolytically cleaved, the hinge region may be associated with either the Fab or Fc fragment. For example, cleavage of an antibody with the protease papain results in the hinge region being associated with the resulting Fc fragment, while cleavage with the protease pepsin provides a fragment wherein the hinge is associated with both Fab fragment simultaneously. Because the two Fab fragments are in fact covalently linked following pepsin cleavage, the resulting fragment is termed the F(ab')2 fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn Fc domain may have a relatively long serum half-life, whereas a Fab is short-lived. [\nCapon et al., Nature, 337: 525-31 (1989\n)] When expressed as part of a fusion protein, an Fc domain can impart longer half-life or incorporate such functions as Fc receptor binding, Protein A binding, complement fixation and perhaps even placental transfer into the protein to which it is fused. The Fc region may be a naturally occurring Fc region, or may be altered to improve certain qualities, such as therapeutic qualities or circulation time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"variable region\" or \"variable domain\" refers to a portion of the light and/or heavy chains of an antibody, typically including approximately the amino-terminal 120 to 130 amino acids in the heavy chain and about 100 to 110 amino terminal amino acids in the light chain. The variable regions typically differ extensively in amino acid sequence even among antibodies of the same species. The variable region of an antibody typically determines the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. The variability in sequence is concentrated in those regions referred to as complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), while the more highly conserved regions in the variable domain are called framework regions (FR). The CDRs of the light and heavy chains contain within them the amino acids which are largely responsible for the direct interaction of the antibody with antigen, however, amino acids in the FRs can significantly affect antigen binding/recognition as discussed herein \ninfra.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"light chain\" when used in reference to an antibody collectively refers to two distinct types, called kappa (k) or lambda (1) based on the amino acid sequence of the constant domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"heavy chain\" when used in reference to an antibody collectively refers to five distinct types, called alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma and mu, based on the amino acid sequence of the heavy chain constant domain. The combination of heavy and light chains give rise to five known classes of antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, respectively, including four known subclasses of IgG, designated as IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n and IgG\n4\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"naturally occurring\" when used in connection with biological materials such as nucleic acid molecules, polypeptides, host cells, and the like, refers to those which are found in nature and not modified by a human being.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"isolated\" when used in relation to Ang-2 or to a specific binding agent of Ang-2 refers to a compound that is free from at least one contaminating polypeptide or compound that is found in its natural environment, and preferably substantially free from any other contaminating mammalian polypeptides that would interfere with its therapeutic or diagnostic use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"mature\" when used in relation to Ang-2, anti-Ang-2 antibody, or to any other proteinaceous specific binding agent of Ang-2 refers to a peptide or a polypeptide lacking a leader or signal sequence. When a binding agent of the invention is expressed, for example, in a prokaryotic host cell, the \"mature\" peptide or polypeptide may also include additional amino acid residues (but still lack a leader sequence) such as an amino terminal methionine, or one or more methionine and lysine residues. A peptide or polypeptide produced in this manner may be utilized with or without these additional amino acid residues having been removed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"effective amount\" and \"therapeutically effective amount\" when used in relation to a specific binding agent of Ang-2 refers to an amount of a specific binding agent that is useful or necessary to support an observable change in the level of one or more biological activities of Ang-2. The change may be either an increase or decrease in the level of Ang-2 activity. Preferably, the change is a decrease in Ang-2 activity.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSpecific binding agents and Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"specific binding agent\" refers to a molecule that has specificity for recognizing and binding Ang-2 as described herein. Suitable specific binding agents include, but are not limited to, antibodies and derivatives thereof, polypeptides, and small molecules. Suitable specific binding agents may be prepared using methods known in the art. An exemplary Ang-2 polypeptide specific binding agent of the present invention is capable of binding a certain portion of the Ang-2 polypeptide, and preferably modulating the activity or function of Ang-2 polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific binding agents such as antibodies and antibody fragments that specifically bind Ang-2 polypeptides are within the scope of the present invention. The antibodies may be polyclonal including mono-specific polyclonal, monoclonal (mAbs), recombinant, chimeric, humanized such as CDR-grafted, human, single chain, catalytic, multi-specific and/or bi-specific, as well as fragments, variants, and/or derivatives thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolyclonal antibodies directed toward an Ang-2 polypeptide generally are produced in animals (\ne.g\n., rabbits, hamsters, goats, sheep, horses, pigs, rats, gerbils, guinea pigs, mice, or any other suitable mammal, as well as other non-mammal species) by means of multiple subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections of Ang-2 polypeptide or a fragment thereof with or without an adjuvant. Such adjuvants include, but are not limited to, Freund's complete and incomplete, mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, and surface-active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and dinitrophenol. BCG (bacilli Calmette-Guerin) and Corynebacterium parvum are potentially useful human adjuvants. It may be useful to conjugate an antigen polypeptide to a carrier protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum, albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor. Also, aggregating agents such as alum are used to enhance the immune response. After immunization, the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for anti-Ang-2 polypeptide antibody titer which can be determined using the assays described herein under \"Examples\". Polyclonal antibodies may be utilized in the sera from which they were detected, or may be purified from the sera, using, for example, antigen affinity chromatography or Protein A or G affinity chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies directed toward Ang-2 polypeptides can be produced using, for example but without limitation, the traditional \"hybridoma\" method or the newer \"phage display\" technique. For example, monoclonal antibodies of the invention may be made by the hybridoma method as described in \nKohler et al., Nature 256:495 [1975\n]; the human B-cell hybridoma technique [\nKosbor et al., Immunol Today 4:72 (1983\n); \nCote et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA) 80: 2026-2030 (1983\n); \nBrodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, (1987\n)] and the EBV-hybridoma technique [\nCole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R Liss Inc, New York N.Y., pp 77-96, (1985\n)]. Also provided by the invention are hybridoma cell lines that produce monoclonal antibodies reactive with Ang-2 polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the hybridoma technique is employed, myeloma cell lines can be used. Such cell lines suited for use in hybridoma-producing fusion procedures preferably are non-antibody-producing, have high fusion efficiency, and enzyme deficiencies that render them incapable of growing in certain selective media which support the growth of only the desired fused cells (hybridomas). For example, cell lines used in mouse fusions are Sp-20, P3-X63/Ag8, P3-X63-Ag8.653, NS1/1.Ag 4 1, Sp210-Ag14, FO, NSO/U, MPC-11, MPC11-X45-GTG 1.7 and S 194/5XX0 Bul; cell lines used in rat fusions are R210.RCY3, Y3-Ag 1.2.3, IR983F and 4B210. Other cell lines useful for cell fusions are U-266, GM1500-GRG2, LICR-LON-HMy2 and UC729-6. Hybridomas and other cell lines that produce monoclonal antibodies are contemplated to be novel compositions of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phage display technique may also be used to generate monoclonal antibodies from any species. Preferably, this technique is used to produce fully human monoclonal antibodies in which a polynucleotide encoding a single Fab or Fv antibody fragment is expressed on the surface of a phage particle. [\nHoogenboom et al., J Mol Biol 227: 381 (1991\n); \nMarks et al., J Mol Biol 222: 581 (1991\n); \nsee\n also \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,885,793\n \n)]. Each phage can be \"screened\" using binding assays described herein to identify those antibody fragments having affinity for Ang-2. Thus, these processes mimic immune selection through the display of antibody fragment repertoires on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, and subsequent selection of phage by their binding to Ang-2. One such procedure is described in PCT Application No. \n \nPCT/US98/17364, filed in the name of Adams et al.\n \n \n,\n which describes the isolation of high affinity and functional agonistic antibody fragments for MPL- and msk-receptors using such an approach. In this approach, a complete repertoire of human antibody genes can be created by cloning naturally rearranged human V genes from peripheral blood lymphocytes as previously described [\nMullinax et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA) 87: 8095-8099 (1990\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce a polynucleotide sequences are identified which encode each chain of the full length monoclonal antibody or the Fab or Fv fragment(s) of the invention, host cells, either eukaryotic or prokaryotic, may be used to express the monoclonal antibody polynucleotides using recombinant techniques well known and routinely practiced in the art. Alternatively, transgenic animals are produced wherein a polynucleotide encoding the desired specific binding agent is introduced into the genome of a recipient animal, such as, for example, a mouse, rabbit, goat, or cow, in a manner that permits expression of the polynucleotide molecules encoding a monoclonal antibody or other specific binding agent. In one aspect, the polynucleotides encoding the monoclonal antibody or other specific binding agent can be ligated to mammary-specific regulatory sequences, and the chimeric polynucleotides can be introduced into the germline of the target animal. The resulting transgenic animal then produces the desired antibody in its milk [\nPollock et al., J Immunol Meth 231:147-157 (1999\n); \nLittle et al., Immunol Today 8:364-370 (2000\n)]. In addition, plants may be used to express and produce Ang-2 specific binding agents such as monoclonal antibodies by transfecting suitable plants with the polynucleotides encoding the monoclonal antibodies or other specific binding agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody or fragment thereof that is derived from other than a human species may be \"humanized\" or \"chimerized\". Methods for humanizing non-human antibodies are well known in the art. (\nsee\n \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 5,859,205\n \n, \n \n5,585,089\n \n, and \n \n5,693,762\n \n). Humanization is performed, for example, using methods described in the art [\nJones et al., Nature 321: 522-525 (1986\n); \nRiechmann et al., Nature, 332: 323-327 (1988\n); \nVerhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534-1536 (1988\n)] by substituting at least a portion of, e.g. a rodent, complementarity-determining region (CDRs) for the corresponding regions of a human antibody. The invention also provides variants and derivatives of these human antibodies as discussed herein and well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso encompassed by the invention are fully human antibodies that bind Ang-2 polypeptides, as well as, fragments, variants and/or derivatives thereof. Such antibodies can be produced using the phage display technique described above. Alternatively, transgenic animals (\ne.g\n., mice) that are capable of producing a repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production can be used to generate such antibodies. This can be accomplished by immunization of the animal with an Ang-2 antigen or fragments thereof where the Ang-2 fragments have an amino acid sequence that is unique to Ang-2. Such immunogens can be optionally conjugated to a carrier. See, for example, \nJakobovits et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA), 90: 2551-2555 (1993\n); \nJakobovits et al., Nature 362: 255-258 (1993\n); \nBruggermann et al., Year in Immuno, 7: 33 (1993\n). In one method, such transgenic animals are produced by incapacitating the endogenous loci encoding the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains therein, and inserting loci encoding human heavy and light chain proteins into the genome thereof. Partially modified animals, that are those having less than the full complement of these modifications, are then crossbred to obtain an animal having all of the desired immune system modifications. When administered an immunogen, these transgenic animals are capable of producing antibodies with human variable regions, including human (rather than \ne.g\n., murine) amino acid sequences, that are immuno-specific for the desired antigens. \nSee\n PCT application Nos., \n \nPCT/US96/05928\n \n and \n \nPCT/US93/06926\n \n. Additional methods are described in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,545,807\n \n, PCT application Nos. \n \nPCT/US91/245\n \n, \n \nPCT/GB89/01207\n \n, and in \n \nEP 546073B1\n \n and \n \nEP 546073A1\n \n. Human antibodies may also be produced by the expression of recombinant DNA in host cells or by expression in hybridoma cells as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransgenesis is achieved in a number of different ways. See, for example, \nBruggeman et al., Immunol Today 17:391-7 (1996\n). In one approach, a minilocus is constructed such that gene segments in a germline configuration are brought artificially close to each other. Due to size limitations (i.e., having generally less than 30 kb), the resulting minilocus will contain a limited number of differing gene segments, but is still capable of producing a large repertoire of antibodies. Miniloci containing only human DNA sequences, including promoters and enhancers are fully functional in the transgenic mouse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen larger number of gene segments are desired in the transgenic animal, yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) are utilized. YACs can range from several hundred kilobases to 1 Mb and are introduced into the mouse (or other appropriate animal) genome via microinjection directly into an egg or via transfer of the YAC into embryonic stem (ES)-cell lines. In general, YACs are transferred into ES cells by lipofection of the purified DNA, or yeast spheroplast fusion wherein the purified DNA is carried in micelles and fusion is carried out in manner similar to hybridoma fusion protocols. Selection of desired ES cells following DNA transfer is accomplished by including on the YAC any of the selectable markers known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs another alternative, bacteriophage P1 vectors are used which are amplified in a bacterial E. coli host. While these vectors generally carry less inserted DNA than a YAC, the clones are readily grown in high enough yield to permit direct microinjection into a mouse egg. Use of a cocktail of different P1 vectors has been shown to lead to high levels of homologous recombination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce an appropriate transgenic mouse (or other appropriate animal) has been identified, using any of the techniques known in the art to detect serum levels of a circulating antibody (\ne.g\n., ELISA), the transgenic animal is crossed with a mouse in which the endogenous Ig locus has been disrupted. The result provides progeny wherein essentially all B cells express human antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs still another alternative, the entire animal Ig locus is replaced with the human Ig locus, wherein the resulting animal expresses only human antibodies. In another approach, portions of the animal's locus are replaced with specific and corresponding regions in the human locus. In certain cases, the animals resulting from this procedure may express chimeric antibodies, as opposed to fully human antibodies, depending on the nature of the replacement in the mouse Ig locus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman antibodies can also be produced by exposing human splenocytes (B or T cells) to an antigen \nin vitro,\n then reconstituting the exposed cells in an immunocompromised mouse, \ne.g\n. SCID or nod/SCID. \nSee\n \nBrams et al., J Immunol, 160: 2051-2058 [1998\n]; \nCarballido et al., Nat Med, 6: 103-106 [2000\n]. In one approach, engraftment of human fetal tissue into SCID mice (SCID-hu) results in long-term hematopoiesis and human T-cell development [\nMcCune et al., Science 241:1532-1639 (1988\n); \nIfversen et al., Sem Immunol 8:243-248 (1996\n)]. Any humoral immune response in these chimeric mice is completely dependent on co-development of T-cells in the animals [\nMartensson et al., Immunol 83:1271-179 (1994\n)]. In an alternative approach, human peripheral blood lymphocytes are transplanted intraperitoneally (or otherwise) into SCID mice [\nMosier et al., Nature 335:256-259 (1988\n)]. When the transplanted cells are treated with either a priming agent, such as Staphylococcal Enterotoxin A (SEA) [\nMartensson et al., Immunol 84: 224-230 (1995\n)], or anti-human CD40 monoclonal antibodies [\nMurphy et al., Blood 86:1946-1953 (1995\n)], higher levels of B cell production are detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, an entirely synthetic human heavy chain repertoire is created from unrearranged V gene segments by assembling each human VH segment with D segments of random nucleotides together with a human J segment [\nHoogenboom et al., J Mol Biol 227:381-388 (1992\n)]. Likewise, a light chain repertoire is constructed by combining each human V segment with a J segment [\nGriffiths et al., EMBO J 13:3245-3260 (1994\n)]. Nucleotides encoding the complete antibody (i.e., both heavy and light chains) are linked as a single chain Fv fragment and this polynucleotide is ligated to a nucleotide encoding a filamentous phage minor coat protein. When this fusion protein is expressed on the surface of the phage, a polynucleotide encoding a specific antibody is identified by selection using an immobilized antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn still another approach, antibody fragments are assembled as two Fab fragments by fusion of one chain to a phage protein and secretion of the other into bacterial periplasm [\nHoogenboom et al., Nucl Acids Res 19:4133-4137 [1991\n]; \nBarbas et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA) 88:7978-7982 (1991\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLarge-scale production of chimeric, humanized, CDR-grafted, and fully human antibodies, or fragments thereof, are typically produced by recombinant methods. Polynucleotide molecule(s) encoding the heavy and light chains of each antibody or fragments thereof, can be introduced into host cells and expressed using materials and procedures described herein. In a preferred embodiment, the antibodies are produced in mammalian host cells, such as CHO cells. Details of such production is described below.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFusion Partners of Specific Binding Agents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment of the invention, the polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence variable domains of Ang-2 antibodies, such as a heavy chain variable region with an amino acid sequence as described herein or a light chain variable region with an amino acid sequence as described herein, may be fused at either the N-terminus or the C-terminus to one or more domains of an Fc region of human IgG. When constructed together with a therapeutic protein such as the Fab of an Ang-2-specific antibody, an Fc domain can provide longer half-life or incorporate such functions as Fc receptor binding, Protein A binding, complement fixation and perhaps even placental transfer. [\nCapon et al., Nature, 337: 525-531 (1989\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the antibody hinge, CH2 and CH3 regions may be fused at either the N-terminus or C-terminus of the specific binding agent polypeptides such as an anti-Ang-2 Fab or Fv fragment (obtained, e.g., from a phage display library) using methods known to the skilled artisan. The resulting fusion protein may be purified by use of a Protein A or Protein G affinity column. Peptides and proteins fused to an Fc region have been found to exhibit a substantially greater half-life in vivo than the unfused counterpart. Also, a fusion to an Fc region allows for dimerization/multimerization of the fusion polypeptide. The Fc region may be a naturally occurring Fc region, or may be altered to improve certain qualities, such as therapeutic qualities, circulation time, decrease aggregation problems, etc. Other examples known in the art include those wherein the Fc region, which may be human or another species, or may be synthetic, is fused to the N-terminus of CD30L to treat Hodgkin's Disease, anaplastic lymphoma and T-cell leukemia (\n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,480,981\n \n), the Fc region is fused to the TNF receptor to treat septic shock [\nFisher et al., N Engl J Med, 334: 1697-1702 (1996\n)], and the Fc region is fused to the Cd4 receptor to treat AIDS [\nCapon et al., Nature, 337: 525-31 (1989\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCatalytic antibodies are another type of fusion molecule and include antibodies to which one or more cytotoxic, or more generally one or more biologically active, moieties are attached to the specific binding agent. See, for example [\nRader et al., Chem Eur J 12:2091-2095 (2000\n)]. Cytotoxic agents of this type improve antibody-mediated cytotoxicity, and include such moieties as cytokines that directly or indirectly stimulate cell death, radioisotopes, chemotherapeutic drugs (including prodrugs), bacterial toxins (ex. pseudomonas exotoxin, diphtheria toxin, etc.), plant toxins (ex. ricin, gelonin, etc.), chemical conjugates (e.g., maytansinoid toxins, calechaemicin, etc.), radioconjugates, enzyme conjugates (RNase conjugates, antibody-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy [ADEPT)]), and the like. In one aspect, the cytotoxic agent can be \"attached\" to one component of a bi-specific or multi-specific antibody by binding of this agent to one of the alternative antigen recognition sites on the antibody. As an alternative, protein cytotoxins can be expressed as fusion proteins with the specific binding agent following ligation of a polynucleotide encoding the toxin to a polynucleotide encoding the binding agent. In still another alternative, the specific binding agent can be covalently modified to include the desired cytotoxin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of such fusion proteins are immunogenic polypeptides, proteins with long circulating half lives, such as immunoglobulin constant regions, marker proteins, proteins or polypeptides that facilitate purification of the desired specific binding agent polypeptide, and polypeptide sequences that promote formation of multimeric proteins (such as leucine zipper motifs that are useful in dimer formation/stability).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis type of insertional variant generally has all or a substantial portion of the native molecule, linked at the N- or C-terminus, to all or a portion of a second polypeptide. For example, fusion proteins typically employ leader sequences from other species to permit the recombinant expression of a protein in a heterologous host. Another useful fusion protein includes the addition of an immunologically active domain, such as an antibody epitope, to facilitate purification of the fusion protein. Inclusion of a cleavage site at or near the fusion junction will facilitate removal of the extraneous polypeptide after purification. Other useful fusions include linking of functional domains, such as active sites from enzymes, glycosylation domains, cellular targeting signals or transmembrane regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are various commercially available fusion protein expression systems that may be used in the present invention. Particularly useful systems include but are not limited to the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) system (Pharmacia), the maltose binding protein system (NEB, Beverley, MA), the FLAG system (IBI, New Haven, CT), and the 6xHis system (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). These systems are capable of producing recombinant polypeptides bearing only a small number of additional amino acids, which are unlikely to affect the antigenic ability of the recombinant polypeptide. For example, both the FLAG system and the 6xHis system add only short sequences, both of which are known to be poorly antigenic and which do not adversely affect folding of the polypeptide to its native conformation. Another N-terminal fusion that is contemplated to be useful is the fusion of a Met-Lys dipeptide at the N-terminal region of the protein or peptides. Such a fusion may produce beneficial increases in protein expression or activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA particularly useful fusion construct may be one in which a specific binding agent peptide is fused to a hapten to enhance immunogenicity of a specific binding agent fusion construct which is useful, for example, in the production of anti-idiotype antibodies of the invention. Such fusion constructs to increase immunogenicity are well known to those of skill in the art, for example, a fusion of specific binding agent with a helper antigen such as hsp70 or peptide sequences such as from diphtheria toxin chain or a cytokine such as IL-2 will be useful in eliciting an immune response. In other embodiments, fusion construct can be made which will enhance the targeting of the antigen binding agent compositions to a specific site or cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther fusion constructs including heterologous polypeptides with desired properties, e.g., an Ig constant region to prolong serum half-life or an antibody or fragment thereof for targeting also are contemplated. Other fusion systems produce polypeptide hybrids where it is desirable to excise the fusion partner from the desired polypeptide. In one embodiment, the fusion partner is linked to the recombinant specific binding agent polypeptide by a peptide sequence containing a specific recognition sequence for a protease. Examples of suitable sequences are those recognized by the Tobacco Etch Virus protease (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) or Factor Xa (New England Biolabs, Beverley, MA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides fusion polypeptides comprising all or part of a variable domain of an Ang-2 antibody, such as a heavy chain variable region with an amino acid sequence as described herein or a light chain variable region with an amino acid sequence as described herein in combination with truncated tissue factor (tTF), a vascular targeting agent consisting of a truncated form of a human coagulation-inducing protein that acts as a tumor blood vessel clotting agent. The fusion of tTF to the anti-Ang-2 antibody, or fragments thereof may facilitate the delivery of anti-Ang-2 to target cells.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nVariants of Specific Binding Agents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nVariants of Specific Binding Agents of the present invention include insertion, deletion, and/or substitution variants. In one aspect of the invention,, insertion variants are provided wherein one or more amino acid residues supplement a specific binding agent amino acid sequence. Insertions may be located at either or both termini of the protein, or may be positioned within internal regions of the specific binding agent amino acid sequence. Insertional variants with additional residues at either or both termini can include, for example, fusion proteins and proteins including amino acid tags or labels. Insertion variants include specific binding agent polypeptides wherein one or more amino acid residues are added to a specific binding agent amino acid sequence, or fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVariant products of the invention also include mature specific binding agent products. Such specific binding agent products have the leader or signal sequences removed, however the resulting protein has additional amino terminal residues as compared to wild-type Ang-2 polypeptide. The additional amino terminal residues may be derived from another protein, or may include one or more residues that are not identifiable as being derived from a specific protein. Specific binding agent products with an additional methionine residue at position - 1 (Met\n-1\n-specific binding agent) are contemplated, as are specific binding agent products with additional methionine and lysine residues at positions -2 and -1 (Met\n-2\n-Lys\n-1\n-specific binding agent). Variants of specific binding agents having additional Met, Met-Lys, Lys residues (or one or more basic residues in general) are particularly useful for enhanced recombinant protein production in bacterial host cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also embraces specific binding agent variants having additional amino acid residues that arise from use of specific expression systems. For example, use of commercially available vectors that express a desired polypeptide as part of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion product provides the desired polypeptide having an additional glycine residue at amino acid position -1 after cleavage of the GST component from the desired polypeptide. Variants which result from expression in other vector systems are also contemplated, including those wherein poly-histidine tags are incorporated into the amino acid sequence, generally at the carboxy and/or amino terminus of the sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsertional variants also include fusion proteins as described above, wherein the amino and/or carboxy termini of the specific binding agent-polypeptide is fused to another polypeptide, a fragment thereof, or amino acid sequences which are not generally recognized to be part of any specific protein sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides deletion variants wherein one or more amino acid residues in a specific binding agent polypeptide are removed. Deletions can be effected at one or both termini of the specific binding agent polypeptide, or from removal of one or more residues within the specific binding agent amino acid sequence. Deletion variants necessarily include all fragments of a specific binding agent polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody fragments include those portions of the antibody that bind to an epitope on the antigen polypeptide. Examples of such fragments include Fab and F(ab')\n2\n fragments generated, for example, by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of full-length antibodies. Other binding fragments include those generated by recombinant DNA techniques, such as the expression of recombinant plasmids containing nucleic acid sequences encoding antibody variable regions. The invention also embraces polypeptide fragments of an Ang-2 binding agent wherein the fragments maintain the ability to specifically bind an Ang-2 polypeptide. Fragments comprising at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 or 50 or more consecutive amino acids of a peptide or polypeptide of the invention are comprehended herein. Preferred polypeptide fragments display immunological properties unique to or specific for the antigen-binding agent so of the invention. Fragments of the invention having the desired immunological properties can be prepared by any of the methods well known and routinely practiced in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn still another aspect, the invention provides substitution variants of specific binding agents of the invention. Substitution variants are generally considered to be \"similar\" to the original polypeptide or to have a certain \"percent identity\" to the original polypeptide, and include those polypeptides wherein one or more amino acid residues of a polypeptide are removed and replaced with alternative residues. In one aspect, the substitutions are conservative in nature, however, the invention embraces substitutions that are also non-conservative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIdentity and similarity of related polypeptides can be readily calculated by known methods. Such methods include, but are not limited to, those described in \nComputational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A.M., ed., Oxford University Press, New York (1988\n); \nBiocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D.W., ed., Academic Press, New York (1993\n); \nComputer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part 1, Griffin, A.M., and Griffin, H.G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey (1994\n); \nSequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press (1987\n); \nSequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M. Stockton Press, New York (1991\n); and \nCarillo et al., SIAM J. Applied Math., 48:1073 (1988\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred methods to determine the relatedness or percent identity of two polypeptides are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Methods to determine identity are described in publicly available computer programs. Preferred computer program methods to determine identity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, the GCG program package, including GAP (\nDevereux et al., Nucl. Acid. Res., 12:387 (1984\n); Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA (\nAltschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 215:403-410 (1990\n)). The BLASTX program is publicly available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and other sources (\nBLAST Manual,\n Altschul \net al.\n NCB/NLM/NIH Bethesda, MD 20894; Altschul \net al., supra\n (1990)). The well-known Smith Waterman algorithm may also be used to determine identity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain alignment schemes for aligning two amino acid sequences may result in the matching of only a short region of the two sequences, and this small aligned region may have very high sequence identity even though there is no significant relationship between the two full-length sequences. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the selected alignment method (GAP program) will result in an alignment that spans at least ten percent of the full length of the target polypeptide being compared, i.e., at least 40 contiguous amino acids where sequences of at least 400 amino acids are being compared, 30 contiguous amino acids where sequences of at least 300 to about 400 amino acids are being compared, at least 20 contiguous amino acids where sequences of 200 to about 300 amino acids are being compared, and at least 10 contiguous amino acids where sequences of about 100 to 200 amino acids are being compared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, using the computer algorithm GAP (Genetics Computer Group, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI), two polypeptides for which the percent sequence identity is to be determined are aligned for optimal matching of their respective amino acids (the \"matched span\", as determined by the algorithm). In certain embodiments, a gap opening penalty (which is typically calculated as 3X the average diagonal; the \"average diagonal\" is the average of the diagonal of the comparison matrix being used; the \"diagonal\" is the score or number assigned to each perfect amino acid match by the particular comparison matrix) and a gap extension penalty (which is usually 1/10 times the gap opening penalty), as well as a comparison matrix such as PAM 250 or BLOSUM 62 are used in conjunction with the algorithm. In certain embodiments, a standard comparison matrix (see \nDayhoff et al., Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, 5(3)(1978\n) for the PAM 250 comparison matrix; \nHenikoff et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA, 89:10915-10919 (1992\n) for the BLOSUM 62 comparison matrix) is also used by the algorithm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the parameters for a polypeptide sequence comparison include the following:\n\n \n \n \nAlgorithm: \nNeedleman et al., J. Mol. Biol., 48:443-453 (1970\n);\n \nComparison matrix: BLOSUM 62 from Henikoff \net al., supra\n (1992);\n \nGap Penalty: 12\n \nGap Length Penalty: 4\n \nThreshold of Similarity: 0\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe GAP program may be useful with the above parameters. In certain embodiments, the aforementioned parameters are the default parameters for polypeptide comparisons (along with no penalty for end gaps) using the GAP algorithm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the parameters for polynucleotide molecule sequence comparisons include the following:\n\n \n \n \nAlgorithm: Needleman \net al., supra\n (1970);\n \nComparison matrix: matches = +10, mismatch = 0\n \nGap Penalty: 50\n \nGap Length Penalty: 3\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe GAP program may also be useful with the above parameters. The aforementioned parameters are the default parameters for polynucleotide molecule comparisons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther exemplary algorithms, gap opening penalties, gap extension penalties, comparison matrices, thresholds of similarity, etc. may be used, including those set forth in the \nProgram Manual, Wisconsin Package, Version 9, September, 1997\n. The particular choices to be made will be apparent to those of skill in the art and will depend on the specific comparison to be made, such as DNA-to-DNA, protein-to-protein, protein-to-DNA; and additionally, whether the comparison is between given pairs of sequences (in which case GAP or BestFit are generally preferred) or between one sequence and a large database of sequences (in which case FASTA or BLASTA are preferred).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the twenty conventional amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage. See \nImmunology--A Synthesis (2nd Edition, E. S. Golub and D. R. Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Mass. (1991\n)), which is incorporated herein by reference for any purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acids may have either L or D stereochemistry (except for Gly, which is neither L nor D) and the polypeptides and compositions of the present invention may comprise a combination of stereochemistries. However, the L stereochemistry is preferred. The invention also provides reverse molecules wherein the amino terminal to carboxy terminal sequence of the amino acids is reversed. For example, the reverse of a molecule having the normal sequence X\n1\n-X\n2\n-X\n3\n would be X\n3\n-X\n2\n-X\n1\n. The invention also provides retro-reverse molecules wherein, as above, the amino terminal to carboxy terminal sequence of amino acids is reversed and residues that are normally \"L\" enantiomers are altered to the \"D\" stereoisomer form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as α-, α-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino acids may also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present invention. Examples of unconventional amino acids include, without limitation: aminoadipic acid, beta-alanine, beta-aminopropionic acid, aminobutyric acid, piperidinic acid, aminocaprioic acid, aminoheptanoic acid, aminoisobutyric acid, aminopimelic acid, diaminobutyric acid, desmosine, diaminopimelic acid, diaminopropionic acid, N-ethylglycine, N-ethylaspargine, hyroxylysine, allo-hydroxylysine, hydroxyproline, isodesmosine, allo-isoleucine, N-methylglycine, sarcosine, N-methylisoleucine, N-methylvaline, norvaline, norleucine, orithine, 4-hydroxyproline, γ-carboxyglutamate, ε-N,N,N-trimethyllysine, ε-N-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, σ-N-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and amino acids (e.g., 4-hydroxyproline).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5' end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5' direction. The direction of 5' to 3' addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5' to the 5' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as \"upstream sequences\"; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3' to the 3' end of the RNA transcript are referred to as \"downstream sequences\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConservative amino acid substitutions may encompass non-naturally occurring amino acid residues, which are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems. These include peptidomimetics and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNaturally occurring residues may be divided into classes based on common side chain properties:\n\n \n \n \n1) hydrophobic: Met, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile;\n \n2) neutral hydrophilic: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gln;\n \n3) acidic: Asp, Glu;\n \n4) basic: His, Lys, Arg;\n \n5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and\n \n6) aromatic: Trp, Tyr, Phe.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nFor example, non-conservative substitutions may involve the exchange of a member of one of these classes for a member from another class. Such substituted residues may be introduced into regions of the human antibody that are homologous with non-human antibodies, or into the non-homologous regions of the molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn making such changes, according to certain embodiments, the hydropathic index of amino acids may be considered. Each amino acid has been assigned a hydropathic index on the basis of its hydrophobicity and charge characteristics. They are: isoleucine (+4.5); valine (+4.2); leucine (+3.8); phenylalanine (+2.8); cysteine/cystine (+2.5); methionine (+1.9); alanine (+1.8); glycine (-0.4); threonine (-0.7); serine (-0.8); tryptophan (-0.9); tyrosine (-1.3); proline (-1.6); histidine (-3.2); glutamate (-3.5); glutamine (-3.5); aspartate (-3.5); asparagine (-3.5); lysine (-3.9); and arginine (-4.5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe importance of the hydropathic amino acid index in conferring interactive biological function on a protein is understood in the art. \nKyte et al., J. Mol. Biol., 157:105-131 (1982\n). It is known that certain amino acids may be substituted for other amino acids having a similar hydropathic index or score and still retain a similar biological activity. In making changes based upon the hydropathic index, in certain embodiments, the substitution of amino acids whose hydropathic indices are within ±2 is included. In certain embodiments, those which are within ±1 are included, and in certain embodiments, those within ±0.5 are included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also understood in the art that the substitution of like amino acids can be made effectively on the basis of hydrophilicity, particularly where the biologically functional protein or peptide thereby created is intended for use in immunological embodiments, as in the present case. In certain embodiments, the greatest local average hydrophilicity of a protein, as governed by the hydrophilicity of its adjacent amino acids, correlates with its immunogenicity and antigenicity, i.e., with a biological property of the protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following hydrophilicity values have been assigned to these amino acid residues: arginine (+3.0); lysine (+3.0); aspartate (+3.0 ± 1); glutamate (+3.0 ± 1); serine (+0.3); asparagine (+0.2); glutamine (+0.2); glycine (0); threonine (-0.4); proline (-0.5 ± 1); alanine (-0.5); histidine (-0.5); cysteine (-1.0); methionine (-1.3); valine (-1.5); leucine (-1.8); isoleucine (-1.8); tyrosine (-2.3); phenylalanine (-2.5) and tryptophan (-3.4). In making changes based upon similar hydrophilicity values, in certain embodiments, the substitution of amino acids whose hydrophilicity values are within ±2 is included, in certain embodiments, those which are within ±1 are included, and in certain embodiments, those within ±0.5 are included. One may also identify epitopes from primary amino acid sequences on the basis of hydrophilicity. These regions are also referred to as \"epitopic core regions.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary amino acid substitutions are set forth in Table 1.\n\n \n \nTable 1\n \n \n \n \n \nAmino Acid Substitutions\n \n \n \n \nOriginal Residues\n \nExemplary Substitutions\n \nPreferred Substitutions\n \n \n \n \nAla\n \nVal, Leu, Ile\n \nVal\n \n \n \nArg\n \nLys, Gln, Asn\n \nLys\n \n \n \nAsn\n \nGln, Glu, Asp\n \nGln\n \n \n \nAsp\n \nGlu, Gln, Asn\n \nGlu\n \n \n \nCys\n \nSer, Ala\n \nSer\n \n \n \nGln\n \nAsn, Glu, Asp\n \nAsn\n \n \n \nGlu\n \nAsp, Asn, Gln\n \nAsp\n \n \n \nGly\n \nPro, Ala\n \nAla\n \n \n \nHis\n \nAsn, Gln, Lys, Arg\n \nArg\n \n \n \nIle\n \nLeu, Val, Met, Ala, Phe, Norleucine\n \nLeu\n \n \n \nLeu\n \nNorleucine, Ile, Val, Met, Ala, Phe\n \nIle\n \n \n \nLys\n \nArg, 1,4 Diamino-butyric Acid, Gln, Asn\n \nArg\n \n \n \nMet\n \nLeu, Phe, Ile\n \nLeu\n \n \n \nPhe\n \nLeu, Val, Ile, Ala, Tyr\n \nLeu\n \n \n \nPro\n \nAla\n \nGly\n \n \n \nSer\n \nThr, Ala, Cys\n \nThr\n \n \n \nThr\n \nSer\n \nSer\n \n \n \nTrp\n \nTyr, Phe\n \nTyr\n \n \n \nTyr\n \nTrp, Phe, Thr, Ser\n \nPhe\n \n \n \nVal\n \nIle, Met, Leu, Phe, Ala, Norleucine\n \nLeu\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nA skilled artisan will be able to determine suitable variants of the polypeptide as set forth herein using well-known techniques. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art may identify suitable areas of the molecule that may be changed without destroying activity by targeting regions not believed to be important for activity. In certain embodiments, one can identify residues and portions of the molecules that are conserved among similar polypeptides. In certain embodiments, even areas that may be important for biological activity or for structure may be subject to conservative amino acid substitutions without destroying the biological activity or without adversely affecting the polypeptide structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, one skilled in the art can review structure-function studies identifying residues in similar polypeptides that are important for activity or structure. In view of such a comparison, one can predict the importance of amino acid residues in a protein that correspond to amino acid residues which are important for activity or structure in similar proteins. One skilled in the art may opt for chemically similar amino acid substitutions for such predicted important amino acid residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne skilled in the art can also analyze the three-dimensional structure and amino acid sequence in relation to that structure in similar polypeptides. In view of such information, one skilled in the art may predict the alignment of amino acid residues of an antibody with respect to its three dimensional structure. In certain embodiments, one skilled in the art may choose not to make radical changes to amino acid residues predicted to be on the surface of the protein, since such residues may be involved in important interactions with other molecules. Moreover, one skilled in the art may generate test variants containing a single amino acid substitution at each desired amino acid residue. The variants can then be screened using activity assays known to those skilled in the art. Such variants could be used to gather information about suitable variants. For example, if one discovered that a change to a particular amino acid residue resulted in destroyed, undesirably reduced, or unsuitable activity, variants with such a change may be avoided. In other words, based on information gathered from such routine experiments, one skilled in the art can readily determine the amino acids where further substitutions should be avoided either alone or in combination with other mutations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of scientific publications have been devoted to the prediction of secondary structure. See \nMoult J., Curr. Op. in Biotech., 7(4):422-427 (1996\n), \nChou et al., Biochemistry, 13(2):222-245 (1974\n); \nChou et al., Biochemistry, 113(2):211-222 (1974\n); \nChou et al., Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol., 47:45-148 (1978\n); \nChou et al., Ann. Rev. Biochem., 47:251-276\n and \nChou et al., Biophys. J., 26:367-384 (1979\n). Moreover, computer programs are currently available to assist with predicting secondary structure. One method of predicting secondary structure is based upon homology modeling. For example, two polypeptides or proteins which have a sequence identity of greater than 30%, or similarity greater than 40% often have similar structural topologies. The recent growth of the protein structural database (PDB) has provided enhanced predictability of secondary structure, including the potential number of folds within a polypeptide's \nor\n protein's structure. \nSee\n \nHolm et al., Nucl. Acid. Res., 27(1):244-247 (1999\n). It has been suggested (\nBrenner et al., Curr. Op. Struct. Biol., 7(3):369-376 (1997\n)) that there are a limited number of folds in a given polypeptide or protein and that once a critical number of structures have been resolved, structural prediction will become dramatically more accurate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional methods of predicting secondary structure include \"threading\" (\nJones, D., Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol., 7(3):377-87 (1997\n); \nSippl et al., Structure, 4(1):15-19 (1996\n)), \"profile analysis\" (\nBowie et al., Science, 253:164-170 (1991\n); \nGribskov et al., Meth. Enzym., 183:146-159 (1990\n); \nGribskov et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., 84(13):4355-4358 (1987\n)), and \"evolutionary linkage\" (See Holm, \nsupra\n (1999), and Brenner, \nsupra\n (1997)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, antibody variants include glycosylation variants wherein the number and/or type of glycosylation site has been altered compared to the amino acid sequences of the parent polypeptide. In certain embodiments, protein variants comprise a greater or a lesser number of N-linked glycosylation sites than the native protein. An N-linked glycosylation site is characterized by the sequence: Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr, wherein the amino acid residue designated as X may be any amino acid residue except proline. The substitution of amino acid residues to create this sequence provides a potential new site for the addition of an N-linked carbohydrate chain. Alternatively, substitutions which eliminate this sequence will remove an existing N-linked carbohydrate chain. Also provided is a rearrangement of N-linked carbohydrate chains wherein one or more N-linked glycosylation sites (typically those that are naturally occurring) are eliminated and one or more new N-linked sites are created. Additional preferred antibody variants include cysteine variants wherein one or more cysteine residues are deleted from or substituted for another amino acid (e.g., serine) as compared to the parent amino acid sequence. Cysteine variants may be useful when antibodies must be refolded into a biologically active conformation such as after the isolation of insoluble inclusion bodies. Cysteine variants generally have fewer cysteine residues than the native protein, and typically have an even number to minimize interactions resulting from unpaired cysteines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to certain embodiments, amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and/or (5) confer or modify other functional properties on such polypeptides. According to certain embodiments, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (in certain embodiments, conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (in certain embodiments, in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts). In certain embodiments, a conservative amino acid substitution typically may not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in \nProteins, Structures and Molecular Principles (Creighton, Ed., W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984\n)); \nIntroduction to Protein Structure (C. Branden and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991\n)); and \nThornton et at. Nature 354:105 (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specific binding agent molecules of this invention that are polypeptide or peptide substitution variants may have up to about ten to twelve percent of the original amino acid sequence replaced. For antibody variants, the heavy chain may have 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 amino acid replaced, while the light chain may have 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 amino acid replaced.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDerivatives of Specific Binding Agents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention also provides derivatives of specific binding agent polypeptides. Derivatives include specific binding agent polypeptides bearing modifications other than insertion, deletion, or substitution of amino acid residues. Preferably, the modifications are covalent in nature, and include for example, chemical bonding with polymers, lipids, other organic, and inorganic moieties. Derivatives of the invention may be prepared to increase circulating half-life of a specific binding agent polypeptide, or may be designed to improve targeting capacity for the polypeptide to desired cells, tissues, or organs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further embraces derivative binding agents covalently modified to include one or more water soluble polymer attachments such as polyethylene glycol, polyoxyethylene glycol, or polypropylene glycol as described \n \nU.S. Patent Nos: 4,640,835\n \n, \n \n4,496,689\n \n, \n \n4,301,144\n \n, \n \n4,670,417\n \n, \n \n4,791,192\n \n and \n \n4,179,337\n \n. Still other useful polymers known in the art include monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol, dextran, cellulose, or other carbohydrate based polymers, poly-(N-vinyl pyrrolidone)-polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol homopolymers, a polypropylene oxide/ethylene oxide co-polymer, polyoxyethylated polyols (e.g., glycerol) and polyvinyl alcohol, as well as mixtures of these polymers. Particularly preferred are specific binding agent products covalently modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) subunits. Watersoluble polymers may be bonded at specific positions, for example at the amino terminus of the specific binding agent products, or randomly attached to one or more side chains of the polypeptide. The use of PEG for improving the therapeutic capacity for specific binding agent, and for humanized antibodies in particular, is described in \n \nUS Patent 6, 133, 426 to Gonzales et al., issued October 17, 2000\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nTarget Sites for Antibody Mutagenesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCertain strategies can be employed to manipulate inherent properties of an Ang-2-specific antibody, such as the affinity of the antibody for its target. These strategies include the use of site-specific or random mutagenesis of the polynucleotide molecule encoding the antibody to generate antibody variants, followed by a screening step designed to recover antibody variants that exhibit the desired change, e.g. increased or decreased affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid residues most commonly targeted in mutagenic strategies are those in the CDRs. As described \nsupra,\n these regions contain the residues that actually interact with Ang-2 and other amino acids that affect the spatial arrangement of these residues. However, amino acids in the framework regions of the variable domains outside the CDR regions have also been shown to make substantial contributions to the antigen-binding properties of the antibody, and can be targeted to manipulate such properties. See \nHudson, Curr Opin Biotech, 9:395-402 (1999\n) and references therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSmaller and more effectively screened libraries of antibody variants can be produced by restricting random or site-directed mutagenesis to sites in the CDRs that correspond to areas prone to \"hyper-mutation\" during the somatic affinity maturation process. See \nChowdhury and Pastan, Nature Biotech, 17: 568-572 [1999\n] and references therein. The types of DNA elements known to define hyper-mutation sites in this manner include direct and inverted repeats, certain consensus sequences, secondary structures, and palindromes. The consensus DNA sequences include the tetrabase sequence Purine-G-Pyrimidine-A/T (i.e. A or G - G - C or T - A or T) and the serine codon AGY (wherein Y can be a C or a T).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, an embodiment of the present invention includes mutagenic strategies with the goal of increasing the affinity of an antibody for its target. These strategies include mutagenesis of the entire variable heavy and light chain, mutagenesis of the CDR regions only, mutagenesis of the consensus hypermutation sites within the CDRs, mutagenesis of framework regions, or any combination of these approaches (\"mutagenesis\" in this context could be random or site-directed). Definitive delineation of the CDR regions and identification of residues comprising the binding site of an antibody can be accomplished though solving the structure of the antibody in question, and the antibody-ligand complex, through techniques known to those skilled in the art, such as X-ray crystallography. Various methods based on analysis and characterization of such antibody crystal structures are known to those of skill in the art and can be employed, although not definitive, to approximate the CDR regions. Examples of such commonly used methods include the Kabat, Chothia, AbM and contact definitions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Kabat definition is based on the sequence variability and is the most commonly used definition to predict CDR regions. [\nJohnson and Wu, Nucleic Acids Res, 28: 214-8 (2000\n)]. The Chothia definition is based on the location of the structural loop regions. [\nChothia et al., J Mol Biol, 196: 901-17 (1986\n); \nChothia et al., Nature, 342: 877-83 (1989\n)]. The AbM definition is a compromise between the Kabat and Chothia definition. AbM is an integral suite of programs for antibody structure modeling produced by Oxford Molecular Group [\nMartin et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA) 86:9268-9272 (1989\n); Rees, \net al.,\n ABM\n™\n, a computer program for modeling variable regions of antibodies, Oxford, UK; Oxford Molecular, Ltd.]. The AbM suite models the tertiary structure of an antibody from primary sequencing using a combination of knowledge databases and ab initio methods. An additional definition, known as the contact definition, has been recently introduced. [\nMacCallum et al., J Mol Biol, 5:732-45 (1996\n)]. This definition is based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy convention, the CDR regions in the heavy chain are typically referred to as H1, H2 and H3 and are numbered sequentially in order counting from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus. The CDR regions in the light chain are typically referred to as L1, L2 and L3 and are numbered sequentially in order counting from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDR-H1 is approximately 10 to 12 residues in length and typically starts 4 residues after a Cys according to the Chothia and AbM definitions or typically 5 residues later according to the Kabat definition. The H1 is typically followed by a Trp, typically Trp-Val, but also Trp-Ile, or Trp-Ala. The length of H1 is approximately 10 to 12 residues according to the AbM definition while the Chothia definition excludes the last 4 residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDR-H2 typically starts 15 residues after the end of H1 according to the Kabat and AbM definition. The residues preceding H2 are typically Leu-Glu-Trp-Ile-Gly but there are a number of variations. H2 is typically followed by the amino acid sequence Lys/Arg-Leu/Ile/Val/Phe/Thr/Ala-Thr/Ser/Ile/Ala. According to the Kabat definition, the length of the H2 is approximately 16 to 19 residues where the AbM definition predicts the length to be typically 9 to 12 residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDR-H3 typically starts 33 residues after the end of H2 and is typically preceded by the amino acid sequence (typically Cys-Ala-Arg). The H3 is typically followed by the amino acid sequence-Gly. The length of H3 can be anywhere between 3 to 25 residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDR-L1 typically starts at approximately residue 24 and will typically follow a Cys. The residue after the CDR-L1 is always a Trp and will typically begin the sequence Trp-Tyr-Gln, Trp-Leu-Gln, Trp-Phe-Gln, or Trp-Tyr-Leu. The length of CDR-L1 is approximately 10 to 17 residues. The punitive CDR-L1 for the antibodies of the invention follows this pattern exactly with a Cys residue followed by 15 amino acids then Trp-Tyr-Gln.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDR-L2 starts approximately 16 residues after the end of L1. It will generally follow residues Ile-Tyr, Val-Tyr, Ile-Lys or Ile-Phe. The length of CDR-L2 is approximately 7 residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe CDR-L3 typically starts 33 residues after the end of L2 and typically follows a Cys. L3 is typically followed by the amino acid sequence Phe-Gly-XXX-Gly. The length of L3 is approximately 7 to 11 residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious methods for modifying antibodies have been described in the art. For example, \n \nUS Patent 5,530,101 (to Queen et al., June 25, 1996\n \n) describes methods to produce humanized antibodies wherein the sequence of the humanized immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework is 65% to 95% identical to the sequence of the donor immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region framework. Each humanized immunoglobulin chain will usually comprise, in addition to the CDRs, amino acids from the donor immunoglobulin framework that are, e.g., capable of interacting with the CDRs to affect binding affinity, such as one or more amino acids which are immediately adjacent to a CDR in the donor immunoglobulin or those within about 3 angstroms as predicted by molecular modeling. The heavy and light chains may each be designed by using any one or all of various position criteria. When combined into an intact antibody, the humanized immunoglobulins of the present invention will be substantially non-immunogenic in humans and retain substantially the same affinity as the donor immunoglobulin to the antigen, such as a protein or other compound containing an epitope. See also, related methods in \n \nUS Patent 5,693,761 to Queen, et al., issued December 2, 1997\n \n (\"Polynucleotides encoding improved humanized immunoglobulins\"); \n \nUS Patent 5,693,762 to Queen, et al., issued December 2, 1997\n \n (\"Humanized Immunoglobulins\"); \n \nUS Patent 5,585,089 to Queen, et al. issued December 17, 1996\n \n (\"Humanized Immunoglobulins\").\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, \n \nUS Patent 5,565,332 to Hoogenboom et al. issued October 15, 1996\n \n (\"Production of chimeric antibodies - a combinatorial approach\") describes methods for the production of antibodies, and antibody fragments which have similar binding specificity as a parent antibody but which have increased human characteristics. Humanized antibodies are obtained by chain shuffling, using, for example, phage display technology, and a polypeptide comprising a heavy or light chain variable domain of a non-human antibody specific for an antigen of interest is combined with a repertoire of human complementary (light or heavy) chain variable domains. Hybrid pairings that are specific for the antigen of interest are identified and human chains from the selected pairings are combined with a repertoire of human complementary variable domains (heavy or light). In another embodiment, a component of a CDR from a non-human antibody is combined with a repertoire of component parts of CDRs from human antibodies. From the resulting library of antibody polypeptide dimers, hybrids are selected and used in a second humanizing shuffling step. Alternatively, this second step is eliminated if the hybrid is already of sufficient human character to be of therapeutic value. Methods of modification to increase human character are also described. See also \nWinter, FEBS Letts 430:92-92 (1998\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs another example, United States Patent \n \n6,054,297 to Carter et al., issued April 25, 2000\n \n describes a method for making humanized antibodies by substituting a CDR amino acid sequence for the corresponding human CDR amino acid sequence and/or substituting a FR amino acid sequence for the corresponding human FR amino acid sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs another example, \n \nUS Patent 5,766,886 to Studnicka et al., issued June 16, 1998\n \n (\"Modified antibody variable domains\") describes methods for identifying the amino acid residues of an antibody variable domain which may be modified without diminishing the native affinity of the antigen binding domain while reducing its immunogenicity with respect to a heterologous species and methods for preparing these modified antibody variable domains which are useful for administration to heterologous species. See also \n \nUS Patent 5,869,619 to Studnicka issued February 9, 1999\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed, modification of an antibody by any of the methods known in the art is typically designed to achieve increased binding affinity for an antigen and/or reduce immunogenicity of the antibody in the recipient. In one approach, humanized antibodies can be modified to eliminate glycosylation sites in order to increase affinity of the antibody for its cognate antigen [\nCo et al., Mol Immunol 30:1361-1367 (1993\n)]. Techniques such as \"reshaping,\" \"hyperchimerization,\" and \"veneering/resurfacing\" have produced humanized antibodies with greater therapeutic potential. [\nVaswami et al., Annals of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunol 81:105 (1998\n); \nRoguska et al., Prot Engineer 9:895-904 (1996\n)]. See also \n \nUS Patent 6,072,035 to Hardman et al., issued June 6, 2000\n \n, which describes methods for reshaping antibodies. While these techniques diminish antibody immunogenicity by reducing the number of foreign residues, they do not prevent anti-idiotypic and anti-allotypic responses following repeated administration of the antibodies. Alternatives to these methods for reducing immunogenicity are described in \nGilliland et al., J Immunol 62(6): 3663-71 (1999\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn many instances, humanizing antibodies results in a loss of antigen binding capacity. It is therefore preferable to \"back mutate\" the humanized antibody to include one or more of the amino acid residues found in the original (most often rodent) antibody in an attempt to restore binding affinity of the antibody. See, for example, \nSaldanha et al., Mol Immunol 36:709-19 (1999\n).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nNon-Peptide Specific Binding Agent Analogs/Protein Mimetics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFurthermore, nonpeptide specific binding agent analogs of peptides that provide a stabilized structure or lessened biodegradation, are also contemplated. Specific binding agent peptide mimetic analogs can be prepared based on a selected inhibitory peptide by replacement of one or more residues by nonpeptide moieties. Preferably, the nonpeptide moieties permit the peptide to retain its natural confirmation, or stabilize a preferred, e.g., bioactive, confirmation which retains the ability to recognize and bind Ang-2. In one aspect, the resulting analog/mimetic exhibits increased binding affinity for Ang-2. One example of methods for preparation of nonpeptide mimetic analogs from specific binding agent peptides is described in \nNachman et al., Regul Pept 57:359-370 (1995\n). If desired, the specific binding agent peptides of the invention can be modified, for instance, by glycosylation, amidation, carboxylation, or phosphorylation, or by the creation of acid addition salts, amides, esters, in particular C-terminal esters, and N-acyl derivatives of the peptides of the invention. The specific binding agent peptides also can be modified to create peptide derivatives by forming covalent or noncovalent complexes with other moieties. Covalently-bound complexes can be prepared by linking the chemical moieties to functional groups on the side chains of amino acids comprising the specific binding agent peptides, or at the N- or C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, it is anticipated that the specific binding agent peptides can be conjugated to a reporter group, including, but not limited to a radiolabel, a fluorescent label, an enzyme (e.g., that catalyzes a colorimetric or fluorometric reaction), a substrate, a solid matrix, or a carrier (e.g., biotin or avidin). The invention accordingly provides a molecule comprising an antibody molecule, wherein the molecule preferably further comprises a reporter group selected from the group consisting of a radiolabel, a fluorescent label, an enzyme, a substrate, a solid matrix, and a carrier. Such labels are well known to those of skill in the art, e.g., biotin labels are particularly contemplated. The use of such labels is well known to those of skill in the art and is described in, e.g., \n \nU.S. No. Patent 3,817,837\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 3,850,752\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 3,996,345\n \n and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,277,437\n \n. Other labels that will be useful include but are not limited to radioactive labels, fluorescent labels and chemiluminescent labels. U.S. Patents concerning use of such labels include for example \n \nU.S. Patent No. 3,817,837\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 3,850,752\n \n; \n \nU.S. Patent No. 3,939,350\n \n and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 3,996,345\n \n. Any of the peptides of the present invention may comprise one, two, or more of any of these labels.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMethods of Making Specific Binding Agents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSpecific binding agents of the present invention that are proteins can be prepared by chemical synthesis in solution or on a solid support in accordance with conventional techniques. The current limit for solid phase synthesis is about 85-100 amino acids in length. However, chemical synthesis techniques can often be used to chemically ligate a series of smaller peptides to generate full length polypeptides. Various automatic synthesizers are commercially available and can be used in accordance with known protocols. See, for example, \nStewart and Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, 2d. ed., Pierce Chemical Co., (1984\n); \nTam et al., J Am Chem Soc, 105:6442, (1983\n); \nMerrifield, Science, 232:341-347, (1986\n); and \nBarany and Merrifield, The Peptides, Gross and Meienhofer, eds, Academic Press, New York, 1-284\n; \nBarany et al., Int. J. Peptide Protein Res., 30, 705-739 (1987\n); and \n \nU.S. Pat. No. 5,424,398\n \n), each incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid phase peptide synthesis methods use a copoly(styrenedivinylbenzene) containing 0.1-1.0 mM amines/g polymer. These methods for peptide synthesis use butyloxycarbonyl (t-BOC) or 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl(FMOC) protection of alpha-amino groups. Both methods involve stepwise syntheses whereby a single amino acid is added at each step starting from the C-terminus of the peptide (See, \nColigan et al., Current Protocols in Immunology, Wiley Interscience, 1991\n, Unit 9). On completion of chemical synthesis, the synthetic peptide can be deprotected to remove the t-BOC or FMOC amino acid blocking groups and cleaved from the polymer by treatment with acid at reduced temperature (e.g., liquid HF-10% anisole for about 0.25 to about 1 hours at 0°C). After evaporation of the reagents, the specific binding agent peptides are extracted from the polymer with 1% acetic acid solution that is then lyophilized to yield the crude material. This can normally be purified by such techniques as gel filtration on Sephadex G-15 using 5% acetic acid as a solvent. Lyophilization of appropriate fractions of the column will yield the homogeneous specific binding agent peptide or peptide derivatives, which can then be characterized by such standard techniques as amino acid analysis, thin layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, molar rotation, solubility, and quantitated by the solid phase Edman degradation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemical synthesis of anti-Ang-2 antibodies, derivatives, variants, and fragments thereof, as well as other protein-based Ang-2 binding agents permits incorporation of non-naturally occurring amino acids into the agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant DNA techniques are a convenient method for preparing full length antibodies and other large proteinaceous specific binding agents of the present invention, or fragments thereof. A cDNA molecule encoding the antibody or fragment may be inserted into an expression vector, which can in turn be inserted into a host cell for production of the antibody or fragment. It is understood that the cDNAs encoding such antibodies may be modified to vary from the \"original\" cDNA (translated from the mRNA) to provide for codon degeneracy or to permit codon preference usage in various host cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, a DNA molecule encoding an antibody can be obtained using procedures described herein in the Examples. Where it is desirable to obtain Fab molecules or CDRs that are related to the original antibody molecule, one can screen a suitable library (phage display library; lymphocyte library, etc.) using standard techniques to identify and clone related Fabs/CDRs. Probes used for such screening may be full length or truncated Fab probes encoding the Fab portion of the original antibody, probes against one or more CDRs from the Fab portion of the original antibody, or other suitable probes. Where DNA fragments are used as probes, typical hybridization conditions are those such as set forth in \nAusubel et. al. (Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Current Protocols Press [1994\n]). After hybridization, the probed blot can be washed at a suitable stringency, depending on such factors as probe size, expected homology of probe to clone, the type of library being screened, and the number of clones being screened. Examples of high stringency screening are 0.1 X SSC, and 0.1 percent SDS at a temperature between 50-65°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of expression vector/host systems may be utilized to contain and express the polynucleotide molecules encoding the specific binding agent polypeptides of the invention. These systems include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria transformed with recombinant bacteriophage, plasmid or cosmid DNA expression vectors; yeast transformed with yeast expression vectors; insect cell systems infected with virus expression vectors (e.g., baculovirus); plant cell systems transfected with virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus, CaMV; tobacco mosaic virus, TMV) or transformed with bacterial expression vectors (e.g., Ti or pBR322 plasmid); or animal cell systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMammalian cells that are useful in recombinant specific binding agent protein productions include but are not limited to VERO cells, HeLa cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, COS cells (such as COS-7), W138, BHK, HepG2, 3T3, RIN, MDCK, A549, PC12, K562 and 293 cells, as well as hybridoma cell lines as described herein. Mammalian cells are preferred for preparation of those specific binding agents such as antibodies and antibody fragments that are typically glycosylated and require proper refolding for activity. Preferred mammalian cells include CHO cells, hybridoma cells, and myeloid cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome exemplary protocols for the recombinant expression of the specific binding agent proteins are described herein below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"expression vector\" refers to a plasmid, phage, virus or vector, for expressing a polypeptide from a DNA (RNA) sequence. An expression vector can comprise a transcriptional unit comprising an assembly of (1) a genetic element or elements having a regulatory role in gene expression, for example, promoters or enhancers, (2) a structural or sequence that encodes the binding agent which is transcribed into mRNA and translated into protein, and (3) appropriate transcription initiation and termination sequences. Structural units intended for use in yeast or eukaryotic expression systems preferably include a leader sequence enabling extracellular secretion of translated protein by a host cell. Alternatively, where recombinant specific binding agent protein is expressed without a leader or transport sequence, it may include an amino terminal methionine residue. This residue may or may not be subsequently cleaved from the expressed recombinant protein to provide a final specific binding agent product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the specific binding agents may be recombinantly expressed in yeast using a commercially available expression system, e.g., the Pichia Expression System (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. This system also relies on the pre-pro-alpha sequence to direct secretion, but transcription of the insert is driven by the alcohol oxidase (AOX1) promoter upon induction by methanol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe secreted specific binding agent peptide is purified from the yeast growth medium by, e.g., the methods used to purify the peptide from bacterial and mammalian cell supernatants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the cDNA encoding the specific binding agent peptide may be cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pVL1393 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). This vector can be used according to the manufacturer's directions (PharMingen) to infect Spodoptera frugiperda cells in sF9 protein-free media and to produce recombinant protein. The specific binding agent protein can be purified and concentrated from the media using a heparin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the peptide may be expressed in an insect system. Insect systems for protein expression are well known to those of skill in the art. In one such system, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) can be used as a vector to express foreign genes in Spodoptera frugiperda cells or in Trichoplusia larvae. The specific binding agent peptide coding sequence can be cloned into a nonessential region of the virus, such as the polyhedrin gene, and placed under control of the polyhedrin promoter. Successful insertion of the specific binding agent peptide will render the polyhedrin gene inactive and produce recombinant virus lacking coat protein coat. The recombinant viruses can be used to infect S. frugiperda cells or Trichoplusia larvae in which peptide is expressed [\nSmith et al., J Virol 46: 584 (1983\n);\n Engelhard et al., Proc Nat Acad Sci (USA) 91: 3224-7 (1994\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the DNA sequence encoding the specific binding agent peptide can be amplified by PCR and cloned into an appropriate vector for example, pGEX-3X (Pharmacia). The pGEX vector is designed to produce a fusion protein comprising glutathione-S-transferase (GST), encoded by the vector, and a specific binding agent protein encoded by a DNA fragment inserted into the vector's cloning site. The primers for the PCR can be generated to include for example, an appropriate cleavage site. Where the specific binding agent fusion moiety is used solely to facilitate expression or is otherwise not desirable as an attachment to the peptide of interest, the recombinant specific binding agent fusion protein may then be cleaved from the GST portion of the fusion protein. The pGEX-3X/specific binding agent peptide construct is transformed into E. coli XL-1 Blue cells (Stratagene, La Jolla CA), and individual transformants isolated and grown. Plasmid DNA from individual transformants can be purified and partially sequenced using an automated sequencer to confirm the presence of the desired specific binding agent encoding nucleic acid insert in the proper orientation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression of polynucleotides encoding anti-Ang-2 antibodies and fragments thereof using the recombinant systems described above may result in production of antibodies or fragments thereof that must be \"re-folded\" (to properly create various disulphide bridges)in order to be biologically active. Typical refolding procedures for such antibodies are set forth in the Examples herein and in the following section.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific binding agents made in bacterial cells may be produced as an insoluble inclusion body in the bacteria, can be purified as follows. Host cells can be sacrificed by centrifugation; washed in 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA; and treated with 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 15 minutes at room temperature. The lysate can be cleared by sonication, and cell debris can be pelleted by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 12,000 X g. The specific binding agent-containing pellet can be resuspended in 50 mM Tris, \npH\n 8, and 10 mM EDTA, layered over 50% glycerol, and centrifuged for 30 min. at 6000 X g. The pellet can be resuspended in standard phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) free of Mg\n++\n and Ca\n++\n. The specific binding agent can be further purified by fractionating the resuspended pellet in a denaturing SDS polyacrylamide gel (Sambrook \net al., supra\n). The gel can be soaked in 0.4 M KCl to visualize the protein, which can be excised and electroeluted in gel-running buffer lacking SDS. If the GST fusion protein is produced in bacteria, as a soluble protein, it can be purified using the GST Purification Module (Pharmacia).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMammalian host systems for the expression of the recombinant protein are well known to those of skill in the art. Host cell strains can be chosen for a particular ability to process the expressed protein or produce certain post-translation modifications that will be useful in providing protein activity. Such modifications of the polypeptide include, but are not limited to, acetylation, carboxylation, glycosylation, phosphorylation, lipidation and acylation. Different host cells such as CHO, HeLa, MDCK, 293, WI38, as well as hybridoma cell lines, and the like have specific cellular machinery and characteristic mechanisms for such post-translational activities and can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the introduced, foreign protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of selection systems can be used to recover the cells that have been transformed for recombinant protein production. Such selection systems include, but are not limited to, HSV thymidine kinase, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase genes, in tk-, hgprt- or aprt- cells, respectively. Also, anti-metabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for DHFR which confers resistance to methotrexate; gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid; neo which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G418 and confers resistance to chlorsulfuron; and hygro which that confers resistance to hygromycin. Additional selectable genes that may be useful include trpB, which allows cells to utilize indole in place of tryptophan, or hisD, which allows cells to utilize histinol in place of histidine. Markers that give a visual indication for identification of transformants include anthocyanins, β-glucuronidase and its substrate, GUS, and luciferase and its substrate, luciferin.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPurification and Refolding of Specific Binding Agents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some cases, the specific binding agents produced using procedures described above may need to be \"refolded\" and oxidized into a proper tertiary structure and generating di-sulfide linkages in order to be biologically active. Refolding can be accomplished using a number of procedures well known in the art. Such methods include, for example, exposing the solubilized polypeptide agent to a pH usually above 7 in the presence of a chaotropic agent. The selection of chaotrope is similar to the choices used for inclusion body solubilization, however a chaotrope is typically used at a lower concentration. An exemplary chaotropic agent is guanidine. In most cases, the refolding/oxidation solution will also contain a reducing agent plus its oxidized form in a specific ratio to generate a particular redox potential which allows for dusykfide shuffling to occur for the formation of cysteine bridges. Some commonly used redox couples include cysteine/cystamine, glutathione/dithiobisGSH, cupric chloride, dithiothreitol DTT/dithiane DTT, and 2-mercaptoethanol (bME)/dithio-bME. In many instances, a co-solvent may be used to increase the efficiency of the refolding. Commonly used cosolvents include glycerol, polyethylene glycol of various molecular weights, and arginine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be desirable to purify specific binding agent proteins or variants thereof of the present invention. Protein purification techniques are well known to those of skill in the art. These techniques involve, at one level, the crude fractionation of the polypeptide and non-polypeptide fractions. Having separated the specific binding agent polypeptide from other proteins, the polypeptide of interest can be further purified using chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques to achieve partial or complete purification (or purification to homogeneity). Analytical methods particularly suited to the preparation of a pure specific binding agent peptide are ion-exchange chromatography, exclusion chromatography; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; isoelectric focusing. A particularly efficient method of purifying peptides is fast protein liquid chromatography or even HPLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain aspects of the present invention concern the purification, and in particular embodiments, the substantial purification, of an encoded specific binding agent protein or peptide. The term \"purified specific binding agent protein or peptide\" as used herein, is intended to refer to a composition, isolatable from other components, wherein the specific binding agent protein or peptide is purified to any degree relative to its naturally-obtainable state. A purified specific binding agent protein or peptide therefore also refers to a specific binding agent protein or peptide, free from the environment in which it may naturally occur.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, \"purified\" will refer to a specific binding agent composition that has been subjected to fractionation to remove various other components, and which composition substantially retains its expressed biological activity. Where the term \"substantially purified\" is used, this designation will refer to a specific binding agent composition in which the specific binding agent protein or peptide forms the major component of the composition, such as constituting about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95% or more of the proteins in the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious methods for quantifying the degree of purification of the specific binding agent will be known to those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. These include, for example, determining the specific binding activity of an active fraction, or assessing the amount of specific binding agent polypeptides within a fraction by SDS/PAGE analysis. A preferred method for assessing the purity of a specific binding agent fraction is to calculate the binding activity of the fraction, to compare it to the binding activity of the initial extract, and to thus calculate the degree of purification, herein assessed by a \"-fold purification number.\" The actual units used to represent the amount of binding activity will, of course, be dependent upon the particular assay technique chosen to follow the purification and whether or not the expressed specific binding agent protein or peptide exhibits a detectable binding activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious techniques suitable for use in specific binding agent protein purification will be well known to those of skill in the art. These include, for example, precipitation with ammonium sulphate, PEG, antibodies (immunoprecipitation) and the like or by heat denaturation, followed by centrifugation; chromatography steps such as affinity chromatography (e.g., Protein-A-Sepharose), ion exchange, gel filtration, reverse phase, hydroxylapatite and affinity chromatography; isoelectric focusing; gel electrophoresis; and combinations of such and other techniques. As is generally known in the art, it is believed that the order of conducting the various purification steps may be changed, or that certain steps may be omitted, and still result in a suitable method for the preparation of a substantially purified specific binding agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is no general requirement that the specific binding agent always be provided in its most purified state. Indeed, it is contemplated that less substantially specific binding agent products will have utility in certain embodiments. Partial purification may be accomplished by using fewer purification steps in combination, or by utilizing different forms of the same general purification scheme. For example, it is appreciated that a cation-exchange column chromatography performed utilizing an HPLC apparatus will generally result in a greater \"-fold\" purification than the same technique utilizing a low-pressure chromatography system. Methods exhibiting a lower degree of relative purification may have advantages in total recovery of specific binding agent protein product, or in maintaining binding activity of an expressed specific binding agent protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is known that the migration of a polypeptide can vary, sometimes significantly, with different conditions of SDS/PAGE [\nCapaldi et al., Biochem Biophys \\ Res Comm, 76: 425 (1977\n)]. It will therefore be appreciated that under differing electrophoresis conditions, the apparent molecular weights of purified or partially purified specific binding agent expression products may vary.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBinding Assays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nImmunological binding assays typically utilize a capture agent to bind specifically to and often immobilize the analyte target antigen. The capture agent is a moiety that specifically binds to the analyte. In one embodiment of the present invention, the capture agent is an antibody or fragment thereof that specifically binds Ang-2. These immunological binding assays are well known in the art [see, \nAsai, ed., Methods in Cell Biology, Vol. 37, Antibodies in Cell Biology, Academic Press, Inc., New York (1993\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunological binding assays frequently utilize a labeling agent that will signal the existence of the bound complex formed by the capture agent and antigen. The labeling agent can be one of the molecules comprising the bound complex; i.e. it can be labeled specific binding agent or a labeled anti-specific binding agent antibody. Alternatively, the labeling agent can be a third molecule, commonly another antibody, which binds to the bound complex. The labeling agent can be, for example, an anti-specific binding agent antibody bearing a label. The second antibody, specific for the bound complex, may lack a label, but can be bound by a fourth molecule specific to the species of antibodies which the second antibody is a member of. For example, the second antibody can be modified with a detectable moiety, such as biotin, which can then be bound by a fourth molecule, such as enzyme-labeled streptavidin. Other proteins capable of specifically binding immunoglobulin constant regions, such as protein A or protein G may also be used as the labeling agent. These binding proteins are normal constituents of the cell walls of streptococcal bacteria and exhibit a strong non-immunogenic reactivity with immunoglobulin constant regions from a variety of species [see, generally \nAkerstrom, J Immunol, 135:2589-2542 (1985\n); and \nChaubert, Mod Pathol, 10:585-591 (1997\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout the assays, incubation and/or washing steps may be required after each combination of reagents. Incubation steps can vary from about 5 seconds to several hours, preferably from about 5 minutes to about 24 hours. However, the incubation time will depend upon the assay format, analyte, volume of solution, concentrations, and the like. Usually, the assays will be carried out at ambient temperature, although they can be conducted over a range of temperatures.\n\n\n \nA. \nNon-competitive binding assays:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nImmunological binding assays can be of the non-competitive type. These assays have an amount of captured analyte that is directly measured. For example, in one preferred \"sandwich\" assay, the capture agent (antibody) can be bound directly to a solid substrate where it is immobilized. These immobilized antibodies then capture (bind to) antigen present in the test sample. The protein thus immobilized is then bound to a labeling agent, such as a second antibody having a label. In another preferred \"sandwich\" assay, the second antibody lacks a label, but can be bound by a labeled antibody specific for antibodies of the species from which the second antibody is derived. The second antibody also can be modified with a detectable moiety, such as biotin, to which a third labeled molecule can specifically bind, such as streptavidin. [See, \nHarlow and Lane, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Ch 14, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY (1988\n), incorporated herein by reference].\n\n\n \nB. \nCompetitive Binding Assays:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nImmunological binding assays can be of the competitive type. The amount of analyte present in the sample is measure indirectly by measuring the amount of an added analyte displaced, or competed away, from a capture agent by the analyte present in the sample. In one preferred competitive binding assay, a known amount of analyte, usually labeled, is added to the sample and the sample is then contacted with an antibody (the capture agent). The amount of labeled analyze bound to the antibody is inversely proportional to the concentration of analyte present in the sample. (See, \nHarlow and Lane, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Ch 14, pp. 579-583\n, \nsupra\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another preferred competitive binding assay, the antibody is immobilized on a solid substrate. The amount of protein bound to the antibody may be determined either by measuring the amount of protein present in a protein/antibody complex, or alternatively by measuring the amount of remaining uncomplexed protein. The amount of protein may be detected by providing a labeled protein. See, Harlow and Lane, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual, Ch 14, \nsupra\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another preferred competitive binding assay, hapten inhibition is utilized. Here, a known analyte is immobilized on a solid substrate. A known amount of antibody is added to the sample, and the sample is contacted with the immobilized analyte. The amount of antibody bound to the immobilized analyte is inversely proportional to the amount of analyte present in the sample. The amount of immobilized antibody may be detected by detecting either the immobilized fraction of antibody or the fraction that remains in solution. Detection may be direct where the antibody is labeled or indirect by the subsequent addition of a labeled moiety that specifically binds to the antibody as described above.\n\n\n \nC. \nUtilization of Competitive Binding Assays:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe competitive binding assays can be used for cross-reactivity determinations to permit a skilled artisan to determine if a protein or enzyme complex which is recognized by a specific binding agent of the invention is the desired protein and not a cross-reacting molecule or to determine whether the antibody to is specific for the antigen and does not bind unrelated antigens. In assays of this type, antigen can be immobilized to a solid support and an unknown protein mixture is added to the assay, which will compete with the binding of the specific binding agents to the immobilized protein. The competing molecule also binds one or more antigens unrelated to the antigen. The ability of the proteins to compete with the binding of the specific binding agents antibodies to the immobilized antigen is compared to the binding by the same protein that was immobilized to the solid support to determine the cross-reactivity of the protein mix.\n\n\n \nD. \nOther Binding Assays:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides Western blot methods to detect or quantify the presence of Ang-2 in a sample. The technique generally comprises separating sample proteins by gel electrophoresis on the basis of molecular weight and transferring the proteins to a suitable solid support, such as nitrocellulose filter, a nylon filter, or derivatized nylon filter. The sample is incubated with antibodies or fragments thereof that specifically bind Ang-2 and the resulting complex is detected. These antibodies may be directly labeled or alternatively may be subsequently detected using labeled antibodies that specifically bind to the antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding assays to detect those Ang-2 specific binding agents that disrupt Ang-2 binding to its receptor are set forth in the Examples herein.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDiagnostic Assays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibodies or fragments thereof of present invention are useful for the diagnosis of conditions or diseases characterized by expression of Ang-2 or subunits, or in assays to monitor patients being treated with inducers of Ang-2, its fragments, agonists or inhibitors of Ang-2 activity. Diagnostic assays for Ang-2 include methods utilizing a specific binding agent and a label to detect Ang-2 in human body fluids or extracts of cells or tissues. The specific binding agents of the present invention can be used with or without modification. In a preferred diagnostic assay, the specific binding agents will be labeled by attaching, e.g., a label or a reporter molecule. A wide variety of labels and reporter molecules are known, some of which have been already described herein. In particular, the present invention is useful for diagnosis of human disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of protocols for measuring Ang-2 proteins using either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies specific for the respective protein are known in the art. Examples include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioimmunoassay (RIA) and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). A two-site, monoclonal-based immunoassay utilizing monoclonal antibodies reactive to two non-interfering epitopes on Ang-2 is preferred, but a competitive binding assay can be employed. These assays are described, for example, in \nMaddox et al., J Exp Med, 158:1211 [1983\n].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to provide a basis for diagnosis, normal or standard values for human Ang-2 expression are usually established. This determination can be accomplished by combining body fluids or cell extracts from normal subjects, preferably human, with a specific binding agent, for example, an antibody, to Ang-2, under conditions suitable for complex formation that are well known in the art. The amount of standard complex formation can be quantified by comparing the binding of the specific binding agents to known quantities of Ang-2 protein, with both control and disease samples. Then, standard values obtained from normal samples can be compared with values obtained from samples from subjects potentially affected by disease. Deviation between standard and subject values suggests a role for Ang-2 in the disease state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor diagnostic applications, in certain embodiments, specific binding agents typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety. The detectable moiety can be any one that is capable of producing, either directly or indirectly, a detectable signal. For example, the detectable moiety may be a radioisotope, such as \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, or \n125\nI, a fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, or luciferin; or an enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, or horseradish peroxidase [\nBayer et al., Meth Enz, 184: 138-163, (1990\n)].\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDiseases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a specific binding agent that binds to Ang-2 that is useful for the treatment of human diseases and pathological conditions. Agents that modulate Ang-2 binding activity, or other cellular activity, may be used in combination with other therapeutic agents to enhance their therapeutic effects or decrease potential side effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention provides reagents and methods useful for treating diseases and conditions characterized by undesirable or aberrant levels of Ang-2 activity in a cell. These diseases include cancers, and other hyperproliferative conditions, such as hyperplasia, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, immunological disorders, and infertility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides methods of treating cancer in an animal, including humans, comprising administering to the animal an effective amount of a specific binding agent that inhibits or decreases Ang-2 activity. The invention is further directed to methods of inhibiting cancer cell growth, including processes of cellular proliferation, invasiveness, and metastasis in biological systems. Methods include use of a compound of the invention as an inhibitor of cancer cell growth. Preferably, the methods are employed to inhibit or reduce cancer cell growth, invasiveness, metastasis, or tumor incidence in living animals, such as mammals. Methods of the invention are also readily adaptable for use in assay systems, e.g., assaying cancer cell growth and properties thereof, as well as identifying compounds that affect cancer cell growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cancers treatable by methods of the present invention preferably occur in mammals. Mammals include, for example, humans and other primates, as well as pet or companion animals such as dogs and cats, laboratory animals such as rats, mice and rabbits, and farm animals such as horses, pigs, sheep, and cattle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumors or neoplasms include growths of tissue cells in which the multiplication of the cells is uncontrolled and progressive. Some such growths are benign, but others are termed malignant and may lead to death of the organism. Malignant neoplasms or cancers are distinguished from benign growths in that, in addition to exhibiting aggressive cellular proliferation, they may invade surrounding tissues and metastasize. Moreover, malignant neoplasms are \ncharacterized in that\n they show a greater loss of differentiation (greater dedifferentiation), and of their organization relative to one another and their surrounding tissues. This property is also called \"anaplasia.\"\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeoplasms treatable by the present invention also include solid tumors, \ni.e\n., carcinomas and sarcomas. Carcinomas include those malignant neoplasms derived from epithelial cells that infiltrate (invade) the surrounding tissues and give rise to metastases. Adenocarcinomas are carcinomas derived from glandular tissue, or which form recognizable glandular structures. Another broad category or cancers includes sarcomas, which are tumors whose cells are embedded in a fibrillar or homogeneous substance like embryonic connective tissue. The invention also enables treatment of cancers of the myeloid or lymphoid systems, including leukemias, lymphomas and other cancers that typically do not present as a tumor mass, but are distributed in the vascular or lymphoreticular systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe type of cancer or tumor cells amenable to treatment according to the invention include, for example, ACTH-producing tumor, acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, cancer of the adrenal cortex, bladder cancer, brain cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia, colorectal cancer, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, Ewing's sarcoma, gallbladder cancer, hairy cell leukemia, head and neck cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, kidney cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer (small and non-small cell), malignant peritoneal effusion, malignant pleural effusion, melanoma, mesothelioma, multiple myeloma, neuroblastoma, glioma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, ovarian (germ cell) cancer, pancreatic cancer, penile cancer, prostate cancer, retinoblastoma, skin cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, squamous cell carcinomas, stomach cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid cancer, trophoblastic neoplasms, uterine cancer, vaginal cancer, cancer of the vulva, and Wilms' tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is particularly illustrated herein in reference to treatment of certain types of experimentally defined cancers. In these illustrative treatments, standard state-of-the-art \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n models have been used. These methods can be used to identify agents that can be expected to be efficacious in \nin vivo\n treatment regimens. However, it will be understood that the method of the invention is not limited to the treatment of these tumor types, but extends to any solid tumor derived from any organ system. Cancers whose invasiveness or metastasis is associated with Ang-2 expression or activity are especially susceptible to being inhibited or even induced to regress by means of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention can also be practiced by including with a specific binding agent of the invention, such as an antibody, in combination with another anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agent, such as any conventional chemotherapeutic agent. The combination of a specific binding agent with such other agents can potentiate the chemotherapeutic protocol. Numerous chemotherapeutic protocols will present themselves in the mind of the skilled practitioner as being capable of incorporation into the method of the invention. Any chemotherapeutic agent can be used, including alkylating agents, antimetabolites, hormones and antagonists, radioisotopes, as well as natural products. For example, the compound of the invention can be administered with antibiotics such as doxorubicin and other anthracycline analogs, nitrogen mustards such as cyclophosphamide, pyrimidine analogs such as 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, hydroxyurea, taxol and its natural and synthetic derivatives, and the like. As another example, in the case of mixed tumors, such as adenocarcinoma of the breast, where the tumors include gonadotropin-dependent and gonadotropin-independent cells, the compound can be administered in conjunction with leuprolide or goserelin (synthetic peptide analogs of LH-RH). Other antineoplastic protocols include the use of a tetracycline compound with another treatment modality, e.g., surgery, radiation, etc., also referred to herein as \"adjunct antineoplastic modalities.\" Thus, the method of the invention can be employed with such conventional regimens with the benefit of reducing side effects and enhancing efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention thus provides compositions and methods useful for the treatment of a wide variety of cancers, including solid tumors and leukemias. Types of cancer that may be treated include, but are not limited to: adenocarcinoma of the breast, prostate, and colon; all forms of bronchogenic carcinoma of the lung; myeloid; melanoma; hepatoma; neuroblastoma; papilloma; apudoma; choristoma; branchioma; malignant carcinoid syndrome; carcinoid heart disease; carcinoma (e.g., Walker, basal cell, basosquamous, Brown-Pearce, ductal, Ehrlich tumor, \nKrebs\n 2, merkel cell, mucinous, non-small cell lung, oat cell, papillary, scirrhous, bronchiolar, bronchogenic, squamous cell, and transitional cell); histiocytic disorders; leukemia; histiocytosis malignant; Hodgkin's disease; immunoproliferative small lung cell carcinoma; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; plasmacytoma; reticuloendotheliosis; melanoma; chondroblastoma; chondroma; chondrosarcoma; fibroma; fibrosarcoma; giant cell tumors; histiocytoma; lipoma; liposarcoma; mesothelioma; myxoma; myxosarcoma; osteoma; osteosarcoma; chordoma; craniopharyngioma; dysgerminoma; hamartoma; mesenchymoma; mesonephroma; myosarcoma; ameloblastoma; cementoma; odontoma; teratoma; thymoma; tophoblastic tumor. Further, the following types of cancers may also be treated: adenoma; cholangioma; cholesteatoma; cyclindroma; cystadenocarcinoma; cystadenoma; granulosa cell tumor; gynandroblastoma; hepatoma; hidradenoma; islet cell tumor; Leydig cell tumor; papilloma; Sertoli cell tumor; theca cell tumor; leiomyoma; leiomyosarcoma; myoblastoma; myoma; myosarcoma; rhabdomyoma; rhabdomyosarcoma; ependymoma; ganglioneuroma; glioma; medulloblastoma; meningioma; neurilemmoma; neuroblastoma; neuroepithelioma; neurofibroma; neuroma; paraganglioma; paraganglioma nonchromaffin; angiokeratoma; angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia; angioma sclerosing; angiomatosis; glomangioma; hemangioendothelioma; hemangioma; hemangiopericytoma; hemangiosarcoma; lymphangioma; lymphangiomyoma; lymphangiosarcoma; pinealoma; carcinosarcoma; chondrosarcoma; cystosarcoma phyllodes; fibrosarcoma; hemangiosarcoma; leiomyosarcoma; leukosarcoma; liposarcoma; lymphangiosarcoma; myosarcoma; myxosarcoma; ovarian carcinoma; rhabdomyosarcoma; sarcoma; neoplasms; nerofibromatosis; and cervical dysplasia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the present invention is using the materials and methods of the present invention to prevent and/or treat any hyperproliferative condition of the skin including psoriasis and contact dermatitis or other hyperproliferative diseases. It has been demonstrated that patients with psoriasis and contact dermatitis have elevated Ang-2 activity within these lesions [\nOgoshi et al., J. Inv. Dermatol., 110:818-23 (1998\n)]. Preferably, specific binding agents specific for Ang-2 will be used in combination with other pharmaceutical agents to treat humans that express these clinical symptoms. The specific binding agents can be delivered using any of the various carriers through routes of administration described herein and others that are well known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther aspects of the present invention include treating various retinopathies (including diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration) in which angiogenesis is involved, as well as disorders/diseases of the female reproductive tract such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and other such conditions associated with dysfunctional vascular proliferation (including endometrial microvascular growth) during the female reproductive cycle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStill another aspect of the present invention relates to treating abnormal vascular growth including cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) gastrointestinal mucosal injury and repair, ulceration of the gastroduodenal mucosa in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease, including ischemia resulting from stroke, a wide spectrum of pulmonary vascular disorders in liver disease and portal hypertension in patients with nonhepatic portal hypertension.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of present invention is the prevention of cancers utilizing the compositions and methods provided by the present invention. Such reagents will include specific binding agents against Ang-2.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of Ang-2 specific binding agents are within the scope of the present invention. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising antibodies are described in detail in, for example, \n \nUS Patent 6,171,586, to Lam et al., issued January 9, 2001\n \n. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a specific binding agent, such as an antibody, or a fragment, variant, derivative or fusion thereof as described herein, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable agent. In a preferred embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions comprise antagonist specific binding agents that modulate partially or completely at least one biological activity of Ang-2 in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable agent. Typically, the specific binding agents will be sufficiently purified for administration to an animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition may contain formulation materials for modifying, maintaining or preserving, for example, the pH, osmolarity, viscosity, clarity, color, isotonicity, odor, sterility, stability, rate of dissolution or release, adsorption or penetration of the composition. Suitable formulation materials include, but are not limited to, amino acids (such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine or lysine); antimicrobials; antioxidants (such as ascorbic acid, sodium sulfite or sodium hydrogen-sulfite); buffers (such as borate, bicarbonate, Tris-HCl, citrates, phosphates, other organic acids); bulking agents (such as mannitol or glycine), chelating agents [such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)]; complexing agents (such as caffeine, polyvinylpyrrolidone, beta-cyclodextrin or hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin); fillers; monosaccharides; disaccharides and other carbohydrates (such as glucose, mannose, or dextrins); proteins (such as serum albumin, gelatin or immunoglobulins); coloring; flavoring and diluting agents; emulsifying agents; hydrophilic polymers (such as polyvinylpyrrolidone); low molecular weight polypeptides; salt-forming counter ions (such as sodium); preservatives (such as benzalkonium chloride, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, thimerosal, phenethyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, chlorhexidine, sorbic acid or hydrogen peroxide); solvents (such as glycerin, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol); sugar alcohols (such as mannitol or sorbitol); suspending agents; surfactants or wetting agents (such as pluronics, PEG, sorbitan esters, polysorbates such as polysorbate 20, polysorbate 80, triton, tromethamine, lecithin, cholesterol, tyloxapal); stability enhancing agents (sucrose or sorbitol); tonicity enhancing agents (such as alkali metal halides (preferably sodium or potassium chloride, mannitol sorbitol); delivery vehicles; diluents; excipients and/or pharmaceutical adjuvants. (\nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, A.R. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Company, 1990\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe optimal pharmaceutical composition will be determined by one skilled in the art depending upon, for example, the intended route of administration, delivery format, and desired dosage. See for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \nsupra.\n Such compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate of \nin vivo\n release, and rate of \nin vivo\n clearance of the specific binding agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe primary vehicle or carrier in a pharmaceutical composition may be either aqueous or non-aqueous in nature. For example, a suitable vehicle or carrier may be water for injection, physiological saline solution or artificial cerebrospinal fluid, possibly supplemented with other materials common in compositions for parenteral administration. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with serum albumin are further exemplary vehicles. Other exemplary pharmaceutical compositions comprise Tris buffer of about pH 7.0-8.5, or acetate buffer of about pH 4.0-5.5, which may further include sorbitol or a suitable substitute therefore. In one embodiment of the present invention, binding agent compositions may be prepared for storage by mixing the selected composition having the desired degree of purity with optional formulation agents (Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \nsupra\n) in the form of a lyophilized cake or an aqueous solution. Further, the binding agent product may be formulated as a lyophilizate using appropriate excipients such as sucrose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be selected for parenteral delivery. Alternatively, the compositions may be selected for inhalation or for enteral delivery such as orally, aurally, opthalmically, rectally, or vaginally. The preparation of such pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is within the skill of the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulation components are present in concentrations that are acceptable to the site of administration. For example, buffers are used to maintain the composition at physiological pH or at slightly lower pH, typically within a pH range of from about 5 to about 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen parenteral administration is contemplated, the therapeutic compositions for use in this invention may be in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution comprising the desired specific binding agent in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. A particularly suitable vehicle for parenteral injection is sterile distilled water in which a binding agent is formulated as a sterile, isotonic solution, properly preserved. Yet another preparation can involve the formulation of the desired molecule with an agent, such as injectable microspheres, bio-erodible particles, polymeric compounds (polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid), beads, or liposomes, that provides for the controlled or sustained release of the product which may then be delivered via a depot injection. Hyaluronic acid may also be used, and this may have the effect of promoting sustained duration in the circulation. Other suitable means for the introduction of the desired molecule include implantable drug delivery devices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, pharmaceutical formulations suitable for parenteral administration may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks' solution, ringer's solution, or physiologically buffered saline. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils, such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate, triglycerides, or liposomes. Non-lipid polycationic amino polymers may also be used for delivery. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents to increase the solubility of the compounds and allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition may be formulated for inhalation. For example, a binding agent may be formulated as a dry powder for inhalation. Polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule inhalation solutions may also be formulated with a propellant for aerosol delivery. In yet another embodiment, solutions may be nebulized. Pulmonary administration is further described in PCT Application No. \n \nPCT/US94/001875\n \n, which describes pulmonary delivery of chemically modified proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also contemplated that certain formulations may be administered orally. In one embodiment of the present invention, binding agent molecules that are administered in this fashion can be formulated with or without those carriers customarily used in the compounding of solid dosage forms such as tablets and capsules. For example, a capsule may be designed to release the active portion of the formulation at the point in the gastrointestinal tract when bioavailability is maximized and pre-systemic degradation is minimized. Additional agents can be included to facilitate absorption of the binding agent molecule. Diluents, flavorings, low melting point waxes, vegetable oils, lubricants, suspending agents, tablet disintegrating agents, and binders may also be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can also be formulated using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art in dosages suitable for oral administration. Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical compositions to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, and the like, for ingestion by the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained through combining active compounds with solid excipient and processing the resultant mixture of granules (optionally, after grinding) to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable auxiliaries can be added, if desired. Suitable excipients include carbohydrate or protein fillers, such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, and sorbitol; starch from corn, wheat, rice, potato, or other plants; cellulose, such as methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, or sodium carboxymethylcellulose; gums, including arabic and tragacanth; and proteins, such as gelatin and collagen. If desired, disintegrating or solubilizing agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, and alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDragee cores may be used in conjunction with suitable coatings, such as concentrated sugar solutions, which may also contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for product identification or to characterize the quantity of active compound, i.e., dosage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical preparations that can be used orally also include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a coating, such as glycerol or sorbitol. Push-fit capsules can contain active ingredients mixed with fillers or binders, such as lactose or starches, lubricants, such as talc or magnesium stearate, and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid, or liquid polyethylene glycol with or without stabilizers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother pharmaceutical composition may involve an effective quantity of binding agent in a mixture with non-toxic excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. By dissolving the tablets in sterile water, or other appropriate vehicle, solutions can be prepared in unit dose form. Suitable excipients include, but are not limited to, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or bicarbonate, lactose, or calcium phosphate; or binding agents, such as starch, gelatin, or acacia; or lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, or talc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional pharmaceutical compositions will be evident to those skilled in the art, including formulations involving binding agent molecules in sustained- or controlled-delivery formulations. Techniques for formulating a variety of other sustained- or controlled-delivery means, such as liposome carriers, bio-erodible microparticles or porous beads and depot injections, are also known to those skilled in the art. See for example, \n \nPCT/US93/00829\n \n that describes controlled release of porous polymeric microparticles for the delivery of pharmaceutical compositions. Additional examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable polymer matrices in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Sustained release matrices may include polyesters, hydrogels, polylactides (\n \nU.S. 3,773,919\n \n, \n \nEP 58,481\n \n), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate [\nSidman et al., Biopolymers, 22:547-556 (1983\n)], poly (2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) [\nLanger et al., J Biomed Mater Res, 15:167-277, (1981\n)] and [\nLanger et al., Chem Tech, 12:98-105(1982\n)], ethylene vinyl acetate (Langer \net al., supra\n) or poly-D(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (\n \nEP 133,988\n \n). Sustained-release compositions also include liposomes, which can be prepared by any of several methods known in the art. See e.g.,\n Eppstein et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA), 82:3688-3692 (1985\n); \n \nEP 36,676\n \n; \n \nEP 88,046\n \n; \n \nEP 143,949\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition to be used for \nin vivo\n administration typically must be sterile. This may be accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. Where the composition is lyophilized, sterilization using this method may be conducted either prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution. The composition for parenteral administration may be stored in lyophilized form or in solution. In addition, parenteral compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the pharmaceutical composition has been formulated, it may be stored in sterile vials as a solution, suspension, gel, emulsion, solid, or a dehydrated or lyophilized powder. Such formulations may be stored either in a ready-to-use form or in a form (e.g., lyophilized) requiring reconstitution prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the present invention is directed to kits for producing a single-dose administration unit. The kits may each contain both a first container having a dried protein and a second container having an aqueous formulation. Also included within the scope of this invention are kits containing single and multi-chambered pre-filled syringes (e.g., liquid syringes and lyosyringes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for treatment will thus vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the indication for which the binding agent molecule is being used, the route of administration, and the size (body weight, body surface or organ size) and condition (the age and general health) of the patient. Accordingly, the clinician may titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. A typical dosage may range from about 0.1 mg/kg to up to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In other embodiments, the dosage may range from 0.1 mg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 1 mg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 5 mg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor any compound, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially either in cell culture assays or in animal models such as mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, or pigs. An animal model may also be used to determine the appropriate concentration range and route of administration. Such information can then be used to determine useful doses and routes for administration in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe exact dosage will be determined in light of factors related to the subject requiring treatment. Dosage and administration are adjusted to provide sufficient levels of the active compound or to maintain the desired effect. Factors that may be taken into account include the severity of the disease state, the general health of the subject, the age, weight, and gender of the subject, time and frequency of administration, drug combination(s), reaction sensitivities, and response to therapy. Long-acting pharmaceutical compositions may be administered every 3 to 4 days, every week, or biweekly depending on the half-life and clearance rate of the particular formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe frequency of dosing will depend upon the pharmacokinetic parameters of the binding agent molecule in the formulation used. Typically, a composition is administered until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The composition may therefore be administered as a single dose, or as multiple doses (at the same or different concentrations/dosages) over time, or as a continuous infusion. Further refinement of the appropriate dosage is routinely made. Appropriate dosages may be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe route of administration of the pharmaceutical composition is in accord with known methods, e.g. orally, through injection by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intra-parenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial, intraportal, intralesional routes, intramedullary, intrathecal, intraventricular, transdermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, enteral, topical, sublingual, urethral, vaginal, or rectal means, by sustained release systems or by implantation devices. Where desired, the compositions may be administered by bolus injection or continuously by infusion, or by implantation device.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively or additionally, the composition may be administered locally via implantation of a membrane, sponge, or another appropriate material on to which the desired molecule has been absorbed or encapsulated. Where an implantation device is used, the device may be implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery of the desired molecule may be via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or continuous administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, it may be desirable to use pharmaceutical compositions in an \nex vivo\n manner. In such instances, cells, tissues, or organs that have been removed from the patient are exposed to the pharmaceutical compositions after which the cells, tissues and/or organs are subsequently implanted back into the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other cases, a binding agent which is a polypeptide can be delivered by implanting certain cells that have been genetically engineered, using methods such as those described herein, to express and secrete the polypeptide. Such cells may be animal or human cells, and may be autologous, heterologous, or xenogeneic. Optionally, the cells may be immortalized. In order to decrease the chance of an immunological response, the cells may be encapsulated to avoid infiltration of surrounding tissues. The encapsulation materials are typically biocompatible, semi-permeable polymeric enclosures or membranes that allow the release of the protein product(s) but prevent the destruction of the cells by the patient's immune system or by other detrimental factors from the surrounding tissues.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCombination Therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSpecific binding agents of the invention can be utilized in combination with other therapeutic in the treatment of Ang-2 pathologies. These other therapeutics include, for example radiation treatment, chemotherapeutic agents, as well as other growth factors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemotherapy treatment can employ anti-neoplastic agents including, for example, alkylating agents including: nitrogen mustards, such as mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan and chlorambucil; nitrosoureas, such as carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), and semustine (methyl-CCNU); ethylenimines/methylmelamine such as thriethylenemelamine (TEM), triethylene, thiophosphoramide (thiotepa), hexamethylmelamine (HMM, altretamine); alkyl sulfonates such as busulfan; triazines such as dacarbazine (DTIC); antimetabolites including folic acid analogs such as methotrexate and trimetrexate, pyrimidine analogs such as 5-fluorouracil, fluorodeoxyuridine, gemcitabine, cytosine arabinoside (AraC, cytarabine), 5-azacytidine, 2,2'-difluorodeoxycytidine, purine analogs such as 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, azathioprine, 2'-deoxycoformycin (pentostatin), erythrohydroxynonyladenine (EHNA), fludarabine phosphate, and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (cladribine, 2-CdA); natural products including antimitotic drugs such as paclitaxel, vinca alkaloids including vinblastine (VLB), vincristine, and vinorelbine, taxotere, estramustine, and estramustine phosphate; ppipodophylotoxins such as etoposide and teniposide; antibiotics such as actimomycin D, daunomycin (rubidomycin), doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, idarubicin, bleomycins, plicamycin (mithramycin), mitomycinC, and actinomycin; enzymes such as L-asparaginase; biological response modifiers such as interferon-alpha, IL-2, G-CSF and GM-CSF; miscellaneous agents including platinium coordination complexes such as cisplatin and carboplatin, anthracenediones such as mitoxantrone, substituted urea such as hydroxyurea, methylhydrazine derivatives including N-methylhydrazine (MIH) and procarbazine, adrenocortical suppressants such as mitotane (o,p'-DDD) and aminoglutethimide; hormones and antagonists including adrenocorticosteroid antagonists such as prednisone and equivalents, dexamethasone and aminoglutethimide; progestin such as hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and megestrol acetate; estrogen such as diethylstilbestrol and ethinyl estradiol equivalents; antiestrogen such as tamoxifen; androgens including testosterone propionate and fluoxymesterone/equivalents; antiandrogens such as flutamide, gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs and leuprolide; and non-steroidal antiandrogens such as flutamide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombination therapy with growth factors can include cytokines, lymphokines, growth factors, or other hematopoietic factors such as M-CSF, GM-CSF, TNF, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-14, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17, IL-18, IFN, TNF0, TNF1, TNF2, G-CSF, Meg-CSF, GM-CSF, thrombopoietin, stem cell factor, and erythropoietin. Other are compositions can include known angiopoietins, for example Ang-1, -2, -4, -Y, and/or the human Ang-like polypeptide, and/or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Growth factors include angiogenin, bone morphogenic protein-1, bone morphogenic protein-2, bone morphogenic protein-3, bone morphogenic protein-4, bone morphogenic protein-5, bone morphogenic protein-6, bone morphogenic protein-7, bone morphogenic protein-8, bone morphogenic protein-9, bone morphogenic protein-10, bone morphogenic protein-11, bone morphogenic protein-12, bone morphogenic protein-13, bone morphogenic protein-14, bone morphogenic protein-15, bone morphogenic protein receptor-IA, bone morphogenic protein receptor IB, brain derived neurotrophic factor, ciliary neutrophic factor, ciliary neutrophic factor receptor, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemotactic factor-1, cytokine-induced neutrophil, chemotactic factor-2, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemotactic factor-2, endothelial cell growth factor, endothelin-1, epidermal growth factor, epithelial-derived neutrophil attractant, fibroblast growth factor-4, fibroblast growth factor-5, fibroblast growth factor-6, fibroblast growth factor-7, fibroblast growth factor-8, fibroblast growth factor-8b, fibroblast growth factor-8c, fibroblast growth factor-9, fibroblast growth factor-10, fibroblast growth factor acidic, fibroblast growth factor basic, glial cell line-derived neutrophic factor receptor-1, glial cell line-derived neutrophic factor receptor-2, growth related protein, growth related protein-2, growth related protein -2, growth related protein-3, heparin binding epidermal growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor I, insulin-like growth factor receptor, insulin-like growth factor II, insulin-like growth factor binding protein, keratinocyte growth factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor-1, nerve growth factor nerve growth factor receptor, neurotrophin-3, neurotrophin-4, placenta growth factor, placenta growth factor-2, platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, platelet derived growth factor, platelet derived growth factor A chain, platelet derived growth factor AA, platelet derived growth factor AB, platelet derived growth factor B chain, platelet derived growth factor BB, platelet derived growth factor receptor-1, platelet derived growth factor receptor-2, pre-B cell growth stimulating factor, stem cell factor, stem cell factor receptor, transforming growth factor,-1, transforming growth factor-2, transforming growth factor-3, transforming growth factor-1.2, transforming growth factor-4, transforming growth facotr-5, latent transforming growth factor-1, transforming growth factor binding protein I, transforming growth factor binding protein II, transforming growth factor binding protein III, tumor necrosis factor receptor type I, tumor necrosis factor receptor type II, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and chimeric proteins and biologically or immunologically active fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nImmunotherapeutics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nImmunotherapeutics generally rely on the use of immune effector cells and molecules to target and destroy cancer cells. The immune effectors may be, for example an antibody of the present invention that recognizes some marker on the surface of a target cell. The antibody alone may serve as an effector of therapy or it may recruit other cells to actually effect cell killing. The antibody may also be conjugated to a drug or toxin (chemotherapeutic, radionuclide, ricin A chain, cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, etc.) and thus may merely serve as a targeting agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the present invention, mutant forms of Ang-2 may be targeted by immunotherapy either antibodies or antibody conjugates of the invention. It is particularly contemplated that the antibody compositions of the invention may be used in a combined therapy approach in conjunction with Ang-2 targeted therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPassive immunotherapy has proved to be particularly effective against a number of cancers. See, for example, \n \nWO 98/39027\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are intended for illustration purposes only, and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAng-2 Expression in Pathological and Normal Tissue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAng-2 expression was examined in normal and pathological tissue using in situ hybridization. Fragments of the human (Genbank Accession Number: AF004327, nucleotides 1274-1726) and murine (Genbank Accession Number: AF004326, nucleotides 1135-1588) Ang-2 sequences were amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR from human or murine fetal lung cDNA, cloned into the pGEM-T plasmid and verified by sequencing. \n33\nP-labeled antisense RNA probes were transcribed from linearized plasmid templates using \n33\nP -UTP and RNA polymerase. Blocks of formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned at 5 µm and collected on charged slides. Prior to \nin situ\n hybridization, tissues were permeabilized with 0.2M HCL, followed by digestion with Proteinase K, and acetylation with triethanolamine and acetic anhydride. Sections were hybridized with the radio labeled probe overnight at 55°C then subjected to RNase digestion and a high stringency wash in about 0.1X SSC at 55°C. Slides were dipped in Kodak NTB2 emulsion, exposed at 4°C for 2-3 weeks, developed, and counterstained. Sections were examined with dark field and standard illumination to allow simultaneous evaluation of tissue morphology and hybridization signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results indicated that in the normal postnatal human, Ang-2 expression is restricted to the few tissues containing angiogenic vasculature, such as the ovary, placenta, and uterus. No Ang-2 expression was detectable in normal adult human heart, brain, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, spleen, muscle, tonsil, thymus, appendix, lymph node, gall bladder, prostate or testis. In five-week-old mouse (but not adult monkey or human), kidneys displayed prominent Ang-2 expression in the vasa recta. To determine whether this expression was a remnant of embryonic development, this experiment was repeated on kidneys derived from mice ranging in age up to one-year-old using the murine Ang-2 probe and conditions described above. Ang-2 expression was observed to decrease during post-natal development, but was still evident in kidneys of one-year-old mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAng-2 expression was also detected in virtually all tumor types tested, including, primary human tumors such as colon carcinoma (5 cases), breast carcinoma (10 cases), lung carcinoma (8 cases), glioblastoma (1 case), metastatic human tumors such as breast carcinoma (2 cases), lung carcinoma (2 cases) and ovarian carcinoma (2 cases) which had metastized to brain, and rodent tumor models such as C6 (rat glioma), HT29 (human colon carcinoma), Colo-205 (human colon carcinoma), HCT116 (human colon carcinoma), A431 (human epidermoid carcinoma), A673 (human rhabdomyosarcoma), HT1080 (human fibrosarcoma), PC-3 (human prostate carcinoma), B16F10 (murine melanoma), MethA (murine sarcoma), and Lewis lung carcinoma mets. Additionally, Ang-2 expression was detected in neovessels growing into a Matrigel plug in response to VEGF and in a mouse hypoxia model of retinopathy of prematurity.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction of Recombinant mAog-2 Protein and Rabbit Polyclonal anti-Ang-2 Antiserum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFull length, His-tagged murine Ang-2 cDNA was obtained by PCR (Clontech Advantage PCR Kit, Cat.# K1905-01) from a murine 15-day embryo cDNA library (Marathon-Ready-cDNA, Cat.# 7459-1, Clonetech, Inc.) using PCR primers for full length human Ang-2. The PCR product was ligated into a CMV promoter expression vector, and the resultant plasmid was transfected into HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells (obtained from ATCC) using FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent (Roche, Cat. #1814443). Stable clones were isolated by G418 selection. Anti-His tag ELISAs and Western blotting were used to screen for mAng-2-his expressing clones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant mAng-2 polypeptide was purified from conditioned media (C.M.) of these cells. The C.M. containing mAng-2-His was purified by a two-step chromatography protocol. Briefly, the conditioned media was titrated to pH 8.9 by adding Tris buffer pH 9.5 to about 20 mM final concentration. Additionally, the detergent CHAPS was added to about 5 mM final concentration. The C.M. was then applied directly to an anion exchange column Q-sepharose ff (Pharmacia). The column was then washed with about 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 containing about 50 mM NaCl. Recombinant mAng-2-His was eluted in a single step using 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 containing about 350 mM NaCl and about 5 mM CHAPS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe eluate from the Q-sepharose column was adjusted to about 4 mM imidazole, and applied to an immobilized metal affinity column (Ni-NTA superflow [Qiagen]). The bound protein was eluted with PBS containing about 5 mM CHAPS and about 100 mM imidazole. The eluate was then concentrated to approximately 1.0 mg/ml, followed by dialysis against PBS. The purity of mAng-2-His was greater than 90 percent as measured by SDS-PAGE Coomassie staining.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRabbits were immunized with about 0.2 mg mAng-2/injection in an attempt to produce antibodies. Rabbits were injected with about 1 mL Hunter's TiterMax® (Sigma) and mAng-2 at a ratio of 1:1. Four weeks later, each rabbit received a repeat injection or booster; two weeks after that, they received their next booster, and at week seven, sera were drawn and evaluated for titer against mAng-2. If the serum titer was high, 50 mL production bleeds were drawn on a weekly basis for six consecutive weeks. However, if serum titer was low, rabbits were given an additional booster, and 50 mL production bleeds were drawn on a weekly basis for six consecutive weeks, beginning at week 9. After six consecutive production bleeds, rabbits were allowed to rest for six weeks. If more sera were required, the rabbits were boosted again one month after the last production bleed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing the Neutralization ELISA (described \ninfra\n), anti-mAng-2 rabbit polyclonal antisera from two rabbits, 5254 and 5255, were observed to neutralize the mAng-2:Tie2 interaction.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMolecular Assays to Evaluate Ang-2 Antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMolecular assays (Affinity ELISA, Neutralization ELISA and BIAcore) were developed to assess direct antibody binding to Ang-2 and related family members, and the effect of antibodies on the Ang-2:Tie2 interaction. These \nin vitro\n and cell-based assays are described as follows.\n\n\n \nA. \nAffinity ELISA\n \n\n\n \n \n \nFor the initial screening of candidate anti-Ang-2 antibodies, purified human Ang-2 (R and D Systems, Inc; catalog number 623-AN; Ang-2 is provided as a mixture of 2 truncated versions) or murine Ang-2 polypeptide (prepared as described above) were used. For confirmatory binding assays, human Ang-2 was obtained from conditioned media of human 293T cells transfected with full length human Ang-2 DNA and cultured in serum free DMEM containing about 50 micrograms per ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing microtiter plates, approximately 100 microliters per well of Ang-2 was added to each well and the plates were incubated about 2 hours, after which the plates were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing about 0.1 percent Tween-20 four times. The wells were then blocked using about 250 microliters per well of about 5 percent BSA in PBS, and the plates were incubated at room temperature for about 2 hours. After incubation, excess blocking solution was discarded, and about 100 microliters of candidate anti-Ang-2 antibody was added to each well in a dilution series starting at a concentration of about 40 nanomolar and then serially diluting 4-fold in PBS containing about 1 percent BSA. The plates were then incubated overnight at room temperature. After incubation, plates were washed with PBS containing about 0.1 percent Tween-20. Washing was repeated four additional times, after which about 100 microliters per well of goat anti-human IgG(Fc)-HRP (Pierce Chemical Co., catalog # 31416) previously diluted 1:5000 in PBS containing 1 percent BSA (bovine serum albumin) was added. Plates were incubated approximately 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were then washed five times in PBS containing about 0.1 percent Tween-20, after which about 100 microliters per well of TMB (3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine Liquid Substrate System; Sigma chemical Company, St. Louis, MO, catalog number T8665) substrate was added and plates were incubated about 5-15 minutes until blue color developed. Absorbance was then read in a spectrophotomer at about 370 nm.\n\n\n \nB. \nNeutralization ELISA\n \n\n\n \n \n \nMicrotiter plates to which human Ang-2 polypeptide was bound were prepared as described for the Affinity ELISA. Candidate anti-Ang-2 antibodies were prepared in serial dilutions as described for the Affinity ELISA above in a solution of PBS containing about 1 percent BSA and about 1 nM Tie2 (provided as a Tie2-Fc molecule where the Tie2 portion contains only the soluble extracellular portion of the molecule; R and D Systems, catalog number 313-T1). After about 100 microliters of the antibody/Tie2 solution was added to each well, the plates were incubated overnight at room temperature, and then washed five times in PBS containing about 0.1 percent Tween-20. After washing, about 100 microliters per well of anti-Tie2 antibody (Pharmingen Inc., catalog # 557039) was added to a final concentration of about 1 microgram per ml and the plates were incubated about 1 hour at room temperature. Next, about 100 microliters per well of goat anti-mouse-IgG-HRP (Pierce Chemical CO., catalog # 31432) was added at a dilution of 1:10,000 in PBS containing about 1 percent BSA. Plates were incubated at room temperature for about I hour, after which they were washed five times with PBS containing about 0.1 percent Tween-20. About 100 microliters per well of TMB substrate (described above) was then added and color was allowed to develop. Absorbance was then read in a spectrophotomer at 370 nm.\n\n\n \nC. \nAffinity BIAcore\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAn affinity analysis of each candidate Ang-2 antibody was performed on a BIAcore\n®\n2000 (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) with PBS and 0.005 percent P20 surfactant (BIAcore, Inc.) as running buffer. Recombinant Protein G (Repligen, Needham, MA) was immobilized to a research grade CM5 sensor chip (Biacore, Inc.) via primary amine groups using the Amine Coupling Kit (Biacore, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding assays were carried out by first attaching about 100 Ru of each candidate anti-Ang-2 antibody to the immobilized Protein G, after which various concentrations (0 - 100 nM) of huAng-2 or mAng-2 were then injected over the bound antibody surface at a flow rate of about 50 ul/min for about 3 minutes. Antibody binding kinetics including k\na\n (association rate constant), k\nd\n (dissociation rate constant) and K\nD\n (dissociation equilibrium constant) were determined using the BIA evaluation 3.1 computer program (BIAcore, Inc.). Lower dissociation equilibrium constants indicated greater affinity of the antibody for Ang-2.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction of Fully Human Ang-2 Antibodies by Phage Display\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFully human Ang-2 antibodies were generated by panning a Target Quest Phage Display Fab library (Target Quest, Inc.) against a human Ang-2 polypeptide (R and D Systems Inc., catalog 623-AN), according to the following protocol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman Ang-2 was immobilized on the surface of polystyrene magnetic beads by two methods: (1) direct coating of Ang-2 at 50 ug/ml at 4C overnight; and (2) indirect capture of Ang-2 by goat anti-Ang-2 antibody at 50 ug/ml at 4C overnight. The bead surface was blocked by 2% milk in PBS (MPBS). The human Fab phage library was pre-selected to remove phage clones reactive to uncoated magnetic beads or the goat anti-Ang-2 antibody. Ang-2-coated magnetic beads were then incubated with library phage at room temperature for 1.5 hours. After the phage binding step, the surface was washed 6 times with MPBS containing about 0.1 \npercent Tween\n 20, followed by washing 6 times with PBS containing about 0.1 \npercent Tween\n 20, followed 2 times with PBS. The bound phage were eluted first with about 100 ug/ml human Tie2-Fc (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and then with about 100 mM triethanolamine. Eluted phage were infected into \nE\n. \ncoli\n TG1 cells, amplified, and rescued for the next round of screening. Selection pressure was increased in successive rounds by incorporating more stringent washes and reducing the number of input phage. After 3 rounds of selection, 18 unique, Ang-2-binding Fab clones were identified, virtually all of which recognized human Ang-2, mouse Ang-2, and rat Ang-2 as measured using the ELISA affinity assay described above. Approximately ten percent of these phage also bound human Ang-1. These clones were converted into IgG1 antibodies as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo obtain additional unique phage, a second round of screening was conducted using the same library but a slightly different protocol. In this protocol, human Ang-2 was plated in NaHCO3 buffer at pH 9.6 in Nunc maxisorp immunotubes at about 4C overnight. Ang-2 was plated at about 1.5, 0.74, and 0.3 ug/ml for panning \n \nrounds\n \n 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The immunotube surface was blocked using about 2 percent milk in PBS (MPBS), before it was incubated with about 2 trillion phage particles (about 50 copies of each unique phage in the library) from the same phage display library referred to above (Target Quest) in about 4ml of 2% MPBS. After the phage incubation step, the surface was washed 20 times with PBS plus about 0.1 \npercent Tween\n 20, followed 20 times with PBS. The bound phage were eluted using 1uM hAng-2 or 1uM human Tie2 (R and D Systems, described above). Eluted phage were infected into \nE\n. \ncoli\n TG1 cells (provided with the phage library), amplified, and rescued for the next round of screening. Sixteen unique, Ang-2-binding Fab clones were identified by PCR amplification of all phage to which hAng-2 or Tie2 bound, and these clones were analyzed by restriction digestion. The DNA of each clone was sequenced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sequence coding for the variable region of each heavy chain from each phage was amplified with complementary primers. The primers were designed to incorporate a HindIII site, XbaI site, Kozak sequence and a signal sequence (translated peptide is MDMRVPAQLLGLLLLWLRGARC; SEQ ID NO: 69) onto the 5' end of the variable region, while a BsmBI site was added onto the 3' end of the PCR product. As an example of how heavy chains were cloned, the template phage DNA for clone 544 (Seq ID No. 19) was amplified using primers 2248-21 (GTG GTT GAG AGG TGC CAG ATG TCA GGT CCA GCT GGT GCA G; SEQ ID NO: 70) which added the last 7 amino acids of the signal sequence and 2502-31 (ATT ACG TCT CAC AGT TCG TTT GAT CTC CAC; SEQ ID NO: 71) which added the BsmBI site onto the end of the variable region. The resulting product was amplified by primers 2148-98 (CCG CTC AGC TCC TGG GGC TCC TGC TAT TGT GGT TGA GAG GTG CCA GAT; SEQ ID NO: 72) which added nine amino acids to the signal peptide (AQLLGLLLL; SEQ ID NO: 73) and 2502-31, and then 2489-36 (CAG CAG AAG CTT CTA GAC CAC CAT GGA CAT GAG GGT CCC CGC TCA GCT CCT GGG; SEQ ID NO: 74) and 2502-31. Primer 2489-36 added, from 5' to 3', the HindIII site, XbaI site, Kozak sequence, and the first 6 amino acids of the signal sequence. The PCR products were digested with XbaI and BsmBI, and then cloned into a mammalian expression vector containing the human IgGI constant region. This vector contains an SV40 promoter and DHFR selection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLight chains from each phage were either kappa or lambda class. For each light chain, complementary primers were designed to add, from 5' to 3', a HindIII site, an XbaI site, Kozak sequence and signal sequence (set forth above). Those chains which had error-free coding regions were cloned as full-length products. As an example, the light chain from phage clone 536 (Seq ID NO. 11) was amplified as a full length coding region using primers 2627-69 (GTG GTT GAG AGG TGC CAG ATG TGA CAT TGT GAT GAC TCA GTC TCC; SEQ ID NO: 75), which added the last seven amino acids of the signal sequence, and primer 2458-54 (CTT GTC GAC TTA TTA ACA CTC TCC CCT GTT G; SEQ ID NO: 76), which added a SalI site after the stop codon. This PCR product was then amplified as previously stated with additional 5' primers, 2148-98 and 2489-36 respectively, paired with primer 2458-54, to finish addition of the signal sequence and cloning sites. The full-length light chains were cloned as XbaI-SalI fragments into the mammalian expression vector described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain lambda clones had errors in their constant regions when compared to natural human constant region sequence. To correct for these discrepancies, overlap PCR was performed using DNA coding for a perfect lambda constant region and the phage derived variable region. These clones were also cloned as XbaI-SalI fragments as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere kappa variable regions were cloned separately from their constant regions, a BsmBI site was added to the 3' end of the PCR product. After digestion of the PCR product with XbaI and BsmBI, the kappa chain variable region was cloned into an expression vector containing the human kappa constant region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe paired light and heavy chain constructs from each converted phage were co-transfected into CHO cells using the Calcium Phosphate Transfection Kit (Invitrogen Corp.) generally according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Media was changed 14-16 hours post transfection, and the cells were passaged into tissue culture dishes for selection after about 48 hours per the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfected cells were isolated by HT selection for approximately 3 weeks, at which time transfected CHO cell colonies were trypsinzed and combined into a \"pool\" of transfected cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSmall-scale conditioned media was collected after 48 hours and assayed for antibody production by Western blot analysis using either anti-human Fc antibody, anti-human kappa antibody, or anti-human lambda antibody. The selected cell populations were then passaged under selective pressure using standard tissue culture sterile technique until enough cells were obtained to seed four 850 cm\n2\n roller bottles with 2x10\n7\n viable cells each, and to prepare frozen stock cell lines using DMSO. After seeding, the cells were maintained in roller bottles with about 10 percent serum containing DMEM medium (Gibco/BRL, Inc) supplemented with glutamine and non-essential amino acids. Cells were maintained for two to three days until a cell confluency of approximately 80% was reached. At this point the media in the roller bottles was switched to a serum free media mixture (50 percent DMEM, 50 percent F12, Gibco) supplemented with glutamine and non-essential amino acids. Conditioned media was harvested after seven days, with fresh serum-free medium being added for one or two additional harvests.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies were purified by Protein G affinity chromatography directly from conditioned medium, using standard procedures. Elution from the Protein G column was accomplished using low pH (about pH 3) buffer, after which the eluted antibody protein was neutralized using 1M Tris, pH 8.5, and then concentrated using 10 kD molecular weight cutoff centrifugal concentrators. The concentrated antibody stock was then buffer exchanged into PBS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThirty-one antibodies have been created, and each consists of two heavy chains and 2 light (kappa or lambda) chains as designated in the following Table 2.\n\n \nTable 2\n \n \n \n \nAntibody Heavy Chain\n \n \n \nAntibody Light Chain\n \n \n \n \n \n526 HC*\n \n526 kappa\n \n \n \n528 HC*\n \n528 lambda\n \n \n \n531 HC*\n \n531 \nlambda\n \n \n \n \n533 HC*\n \n533 lambda\n \n \n \n535 HC*\n \n535 lambda\n \n \n \n536 HC*\n \n536 \nkappa\n \n \n \n \n537 HC*\n \n537 lambda\n \n \n \n540 HC*\n \n540 lambda\n \n \n \n543 HC*\n \n543 \nkappa\n \n \n \n \n544 HC*\n \n544 kappa\n \n \n \n545 HC*\n \n545 lambda\n \n \n \n546 HC*\n \n546 lambda\n \n \n \n551 HC*\n \n551 kappa\n \n \n \n553 HC*\n \n553 kappa\n \n \n \n555 HC*\n \n555 kappa\n \n \n \n558 HC\n \n558 kappa\n \n \n \n559 HC\n \n559 lambda\n \n \n \n565 HC*\n \n565 kappa\n \n \n \nF1-C6 HC\n \nF1-C6 lambda\n \n \n \nFB1-A7 HC\n \nFB1-A7 lambda\n \n \n \nFD-B2 HC\n \nFD-B2 lambda\n \n \n \nFE-B7 HC\n \nFE-B7 kappa\n \n \n \nFJ-G11 HC\n \nFJ-G11 kappa\n \n \n \nFK-E3 HC\n \nFK-E3 kappa\n \n \n \nG1D4 HC*\n \nG1D4 lambda\n \n \n \nGC1E8 HC\n \nGC1E8 lambda\n \n \n \nH1C12 HC\n \nH1C12 lambda\n \n \n \nIA1-1E7 HC\n \nIA1-1E7 kappa\n \n \n \nIF-1C10 HC\n \nIF-1C10 lambda\n \n \n \nIK-2E2 HC\n \nIK-2E2 lambda\n \n \n \nIP-2C 11 HC\n \nIP-2C 11 kappa\n \n \n \n \n \n* Tested for binding to hAng-2, mAng-2, and hAng-1 as described herein.\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following four tables set forth the sequences and SEQ ID NOs. of the heavy and light (kappa and lambda) chains of the 31 anti-Ang-2 antibodies converted from phage to full length IgG1 antibodies.

Twenty-four mice were treated with polyclonal anti-Ang-2 rabbit antibody (1 mg per mouse). Four treated animals were sacrificed at each of the following time points post-injection of antibody: 1 hour, 6 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results indicated that total rabbit IgG had a circulatory half-life in serum of approximately 19 days, while the anti-Ang-2 IgG component of the total IgG had a half-life of approximately eight days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assess therapeutic efficacy, mice (10 animals/group) bearing A431 tumor xenografts were given 10 doses (about 10 mg IgG per mouse per dose) intraperitoneally of Protein G purified anti-mAng-2 polyclonal antibody on \n \ndays\n \n 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 18 after xenografting. Tumor size was measured on \ndays\n 7, 12, 15, 19, and 21. Body weight was measured on \n \ndays\n \n 0, 7, 15, and 21, and was unaffected by treatment. Results indicated that the anti-Ang-2 polyclonal antibody inhibited the A431 tumor xenograft growth by about 50 percent with p=0.008 versus controls of non-immune purified polyclonal antiserum (10 mg IgG per mouse per dose) and vehicle (PBS) by repeated measures ANOVA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo test the efficacy of the fully human monoclonal anti-Ang-2 antibodies \nin vivo\n, mice (10 animals/group) bearing A431 tumor xenografts were treated intraperitoneally with either anti-Ang-2 \n \n \nantibody clone\n \n \n 533, 537, or 544, or with negative controls of PBS or human IgG 1-kappa. Dosing was about 420 ug protein per mouse for the first dose, about 140 ug protein per mouse for each of the next three doses, and about 55 ug protein per mouse for each of the next four doses, for a total of 8 doses per mouse. Tumor volumes and body weights were recorded twice weekly. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed and their serum was collected for measuring antibody levels by ELISA. Tumors and a panel of normal tissues were collected from all groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRemarkable differences in tumor growth between the anti-Ang-2-treated and control groups were found as shown in \nFigure 1\n. All three anti-Ang-2 treatments inhibited tumor growth as compared to controls (p < .005 vs. hIgG1 control in all treatments using repeated measure ANOVA for all 3 antibodies). In contrast, tumors in control groups continued to grow at a much greater rate.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpitope Mapping\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFull-length (amino acids 1-495), N-terminal (amino acids 1-254) and C-terminal (amino acids 255-495) human Ang-2 (hAng-2) proteins were cloned into a CMV-driven mammalian expression vector with C-terminal 6xHis tags. The three resultant constructs plus a vector control were transiently expressed into 293T cells. Conditioned media were then collected from the transfected cells, and the expression level of Ang-2 in the media was estimated by anti-6xhis ELISA and Western blotting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding epitope of anti-Ang-2 antibodies and peptibodies was determined by their ability to bind the three versions of human hAng-2 by ELISA according to the following protocol: a high-binding 96-well assay plate was coated with 100 µl of conditioned media per well, and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Conditioned media was aspirated, and the plate was blocked with 200 µl per well of 5% BSA in PBS at room temperature for 1 hour. The blocking solution was then aspirated. 100 µl per well of antibody, peptibody, or Tie2-Fc was added at 1µg/ml in 1% BSA in PBS, and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. The wells were washed 4 times with 200 µl of 0.1% Tween in PBS. 100 µl per well of HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG were added, and incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes. The wells were then washed with 200 µl of 0.1% Tween in \nPBS\n 4 times. 100 µl per well of TMB substrate was then added. O.D. was read at 370nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are set forth in \nFigure 2A\n, \nFigure 2B\n, and \nFigure 2C\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAspects of the invention are:\n\n \n \n \n1.

The number of chronic patients has increased due to virus infection year after year, and a majority of such patients develop hepatocirrhosis and then hepatocellular carcinoma in many cases. Under such circumstances, it has been extremely strongly desired that an early diagnostic method applied at stages ranging from such hepatocirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma and a method for treating hepatocellular carcinoma be developed. If a breakthrough resolution were not found, the number of people dying would increase over the next 10 to 15 years. As a diagnostic method, such hepatocellular carcinoma is comprehensively evaluated on the basis of biochemical data such as the values of GOP/GTP, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, etc. in serum or the value of AFP (α-photoprotein) used as a tumor marker, and diagnostic imaging. Thereafter, if necessary, a small amount of piece of tissue is collected by a needle biopsy, and a confirmed diagnosis is carried out based on pathological determination. At present, a tumor marker has been used particularly in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma The positive rate of α-photoprotein (AFP), the most commonly used tumor marker, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma is approximately 60 to 70%. However, such a positive result may also be obtained, when a subject is a patient with a chronic liver disease or a pregnant woman. In addition, the positive rate of PIVKA-II, a tumor marker for hepatic carcinoma, is low (somewhat lower than 50%), but the specificity of this marker to hepatocellular carcinoma is considered higher than that of AFP. Currently, such two types of examinations have mainly been conducted. At any rate, since false positive or double negative cases exist, it is anticipated that a tumor marker having high specificity be developed.\n\n\nIn recent years, a gene analysis technique using a high-performance array such as a DNA microarray has been developed, and thus all-inclusive and comprehensive analyses of gene expression in carcinoma have become practicable. A change in the expression level of mRNA in cancer tissues is analyzed by a DNA microarray analysis method, and a gene group associated with malignant degeneration of carcinoma due to multistep factors, invasion or metastasis of cancer cells, etc. has been comprehensively identified. Moreover, it is expected that several numbers of new findings regarding the new properties of cancer cells will be obtained by clarifying the individual physiological functions of such an identified gene group. Thus, identification of molecules, the expression of which is accentuated or decreased in various types of carcinomas, has been progressing.\n\n\nROBO1, a hepatocellular carcinoma-specific expression molecule, is a type I membrane protein that is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, to which N-CAM, DCC, L1-CAM, etc. belong. ROBO1 has 5 immunoglobulin domains and 3 fibronectin III domains in the extracellular region thereof. The amino acid sequence is highly conserved in various organisms ranging from a fly to a human. It shows amino acid sequence homology of 34% with \nC. elegans, \n33% with Dorosofila, 96% with a mouse, and 95% with a rat. A fly homolog of ROBO1 has been cloned as a molecule that controls the median crossing of an axial filament in gene screening studies of fruit flies. It has been reported that such a fly homolog is a Slit protein receptor. In addition, by another study group, ROBO1 has also been identified as Dutt1 (Deleted U Twenty Twenty), a molecule existing in a homozygous missing region in the chromosomal region 3p12 of U2020 that is a cell line of lung small cell carcinoma With regard to ROBO1, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome is detected at a high frequency in lung cancer, breast cancer, and kidney cancer. Due to methylation of a promoter region in the other allele, the expression thereof is suppressed. Such facts suggest the possibility of ROBO1 as a cancer suppressor gene. In the case of ROBO1 homozygous deficient mice, it has been reported that half of the mice die during the prenatal period, and that the surviving half mice also lead to death due to pulmonary hypoplasia. In addition, in the case of ROBO1 heterozygous deficient mice, the incidence of \ncancer\n 1 year or more after the birth is 3 times higher than that of normal mice. From this fact as well, ROBO1 is considered to be a cancer suppressor gene. Moreover, the expression of a Slit2 gene that is a ROBO1 ligand is also suppressed by methylation or the like in many types of carcinomas. In a test using a conditioning medium of Slit2 or the like, Slit2 exhibited proliferative inhibitory action and apoptotic action towards a lung cancer cell line, a breast cancer cell line, and a colon cancer cell line. Thus, Slit2 is also considered to be a candidate molecule for a cancer suppressor gene. As a completely different finding, Wang et al. has reported that ROBO1 is expressed in neovascularity, and that the expression of Slit2 is accentuated in cancer cells and it is associated with vascularization in cancer cells.\n\n\nFurthermore, identification of ROBO1 as a hepatocellular carcinoma antigen, the potential treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma using an anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibody towards a ROBO1 antigen as a target, and the potential serodiagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma using a soluble-type ROBO1 as an indicator, have also been reported (Non-patent document 1).\n\n\nOn the other hand, the diagnostic imaging of tumor is carried out using CT or MRI. However, in some cases, it is difficult for CT or MRI to carry out differentiation of benign tumor from malignant tumor, diagnosis of recurrence after surgery, differentiation of the tumor from other pathologic lesions, even using a contrast medium. Recently, Positrom Emission Tomography (PET) using \n18\nF-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (\n18\nF-FDG) has been used as a diagnostic imaging to assist CT or MRI. However, since \n18\nF-FDG is accumulated even in normal tissues (for example, brain, etc.) involving active glucose metabolism or in inflammatory tissue at an acute stage, as a diagnostic mechanism using \n18\nF-FDG, it has been difficult to make a diagnosis in some types of a tumor. Moreover, in drug discovery, molecular imaging is a technique of visualizing a small amount of molecule existing in a living body, such as a protein molecule in a living body, using such amount as an indicator, and further quantifying the dynamics. In particular, such a method using PET is excellent in terms of detection sensitivity and quantitative capability. In particular, PET used for small animals is expected to drastically accelerate in-vivo translational research and to have an impact on innovative changes in a drug discovery process.\n\n\nNon-patent document 1: Ito H, et al, Identification of ROBO1 as a nobel hepatocellular carcinoma antigen and a potential therapeutic and diagnostic target.

It is a particular object of the present invention to provide a tumor diagnostic agent used in PET that is capable of diagnosing hepatic carcinoma.\n\n\nA Means for Solving the Object\n\n\nIn general, it is not easy to produce a monoclonal antibody that specifically detects a membrane protein molecule with high sensitivity. One reason is that it is not easy to prepare an antigen. Further, the function of such a membrane protein is biologically particularly important in many cases, and high homology is conserved across species. Thus, it is anticipated that a mouse is in a state of immunologic tolerance to an antigen site. In the present invention, a virus display antigen that had applied a baculovirus expression system was used as an immunogen. Thereafter, a transgenic mouse, in which gp64 used as a major protein of the viral antigen had been allowed to excessively express, was immunized with the immunogen. Thus, an attempt was made to suppress generation of an antibody reacting with the virus and to specifically produce a monoclonal antibody reacting with ROBO1. As a result, the present inventors have succeeded in obtaining a monoclonal antibody capable of specifically recognizing ROBO1 existing on the surface of a cell. Moreover, the inventors have found that an excellent tumor diagnostic agent used in PET can be provided by labeling the aforementioned monoclonal antibody with a radioactive metal. The present invention has been completed based on such findings.\n\n\nThat is to say, the present invention provides the following features.\n\n \n \n(1) A monoclonal antibody capable of specifically recognizing ROBO1 existing on the surface of a cell, which is obtained by immunizing an animal to be immunized with a ROBO1-displaying budded baculovirus recovered from the culture supernatant of host cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus comprising the fill-length cDNA of ROBO1 as an antigen.\n \n(2) The monoclonal antibody according to (1) above, wherein the animal to be immunized is a transgenic mouse in which gp64 is excessively expressed.\n \n(3) The monoclonal antibody according to (1) above, which is selected by screening using a cell, on the surface of which ROBO1 is expressed.\n \n(4) The monoclonal antibody according to (1) above, which is produced from a hybridoma having accession No. FERM BP-10921.\n \n(5) A hybridoma, which produces the monoclonal antibody according to (1).\n \n(6) A hybridoma having accession No. FERM BP-10921.\n \n(7) A method for producing the monoclonal antibody according to (1) above, which comprises: immunizing an animal to be immunized with a ROBO1-displaying budded baculovirus recovered from the culture supernatant of host cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus comprising the full-length cDNA of ROBO1 as an antigen; recovering antibody-generating cells from the immunized animal; culturing a hybridoma produced using the antibody-generating cells; and allowing the hybridoma to produce a monoclonal antibody capable of specifically recognizing ROBO1 existing on the surface of a cell.\n \n(8) A tumor diagnostic agent used in PET, which comprises the monoclonal antibody according to (1) above labeled with a radioactive metal.\n \n(9) The tumor diagnostic agent used in PET according to (8) above, wherein the radioactive metal is \n64\nCu.\n \n\n\nEffect of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention provides a novel antibody capable of specifically recognizing ROBO1, which is allowed to express in a cell membrane. The present invention further provides a tumor diagnostic agent used in PET, which comprises the above antibody. By extracorporeally imaging a tumor using the tumor diagnostic agent used in PET of the present invention so as to examine expansion (invasion or metastasis) of a pathologic lesion, it becomes possible to enhance precision of a diagnosis. Moreover, by the combined use of the above tumor diagnostic agent with an internal treatment with a radioactive ray, external application of a radioactive ray, ultrasonic therapy, thermal therapy, etc., it becomes possible to extend the possibility of such a treatment and to improve a cure rate.\n\n\nBEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention will be described in detail below.\n\n\n(1) ROBO1 used as antigen\n\n\nIn order to analyze expression of ROBO1 at a protein level, an anti-ROBO1 antibody having high specificity is required. In the present invention, an anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibody was produced. ROBO1 shows homology of 95% or more at the amino acid sequence level with a mouse. Thus, in the present invention, a common immunization method was not used, but two types of methods, namely, a method of immunizing a gp64-expressing transgenic mouse with a budded baculovirus antigen (BV antigen) and a method of immunizing a MRL/lpr mouse with a soluble-type ROBO1 purified antigen (sROBO1-His) were adopted. ROBO1 has domains characteristic for an extracellular region, namely, 5 immunoglobulin domains and 3 fibronectin III domains. Thus, while maintaining each of the aforementioned domains, a Gp64-bound antigen was designed.\n\n\nThat is to say, the monoclonal antibody of the present invention that is capable of specifically recognizing ROBO1 existing on the surface of a cell is characterized in that it is obtained by immunizing an animal to be immunized with a ROBO1-displaying budded baculovirus recovered from the culture supernatant of host cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus comprising the full-length cDNA of ROBO1 as an antigen. The animal to be immunized is preferably a transgenic mouse, which excessively expresses gp64.\n\n\nThe full-length cDNA of ROBO1 may be either the cDNA of a wild-type ROBO1, or the cDNA of mutant ROBO1. A mutant desirably has an amino acid sequence, which shows identity of at least 80%, preferably 90% or more, and more preferably 95% or more, with the amino acid sequence of wild-type ROBO1. Amino acid residues to be mutated are preferably mutated with other amino acid residues in which the properties of an amino acid side chain are conserved. Examples of the properties of such an amino acid side chain include hydrophobic amino acids (A, I, L, M, F, P, W, Y, and V), hydrophilic amino acids (R, D, N, C, E, Q, G, H, K, S, and T), amino acids having an aliphatic side chain (G, A, V, L, I, and P), amino acids having a hydroxyl group-containing side chain (S, T, and Y), amino acids having a sulfur atom-containing side chain (C and M), amino acids having a carboxylic acid- and amide-containing side chain (D, N, E, and Q), amino acids having a base-containing side chain (R, K, and H), and amino acids having an aromatic series-containing side chain (H, F, Y, and W) (wherein the characters in parentheses indicate amino acids, each of which is indicated with a single character). Persons skilled in the art are able to introduce mutation into amino acids of a certain protein according to a known method such as site-directed mutagenesis, as appropriate, so as to prepare a protein equivalent to the certain protein.\n\n\nIn the present invention, a ROBO1-displaying budded. baculovirus recovered from the culture supernatant of host cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus comprising the full-length cDNA of ROBO1 is used as an antigen. A method of preparing such a ROBO1-displaying budded baculovirus used as an antigen is known. Thus, such a ROBO1-displaying budded baculovirus can be prepared according to the methods described in JP Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2001-333773 A; JP Patent Publication (Kokai) No. 2003-52370 A; Loisel T P, Ansanay H, St-Onge S, Gay B, Boulanger P. Strosberg A D, Marullo S, Bouvier M., Nat. Biotechnol. 1997 November; 15(12): 1300-4, Recovery of homogeneous and functional beta 2-adrenergic receptors from extracellular baculovirus particles; and International Publication WO98/46777, for example.\n\n\nSpecifically, at least one type of recombinant baculovirus comprising the full-length cDNA of ROBO1 is used. Baculovirus, which transmits to insects and develops disease therein, is an envelope virus having cyclic double-stranded DNA as a gene. This virus shows sensitivity to insects belonging to \nLepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera\n, etc. Examples of baculovirus used in the present invention include \nAutographa californica \nNPV (AcNPV) of a gamma moth subfamily of NPV and \nBombyx mori \nNPV (BmNPV) of a silk worm. Such a virus can be used as a vector. An example of host cells (infected and subcultured cells) of AcNPV is \nSpodoptera frugiperda \ncells (Sf cells). An example of host cells (infected and subcultured cells) of BmNPV is BmN4 cells. Such Sf cells have a growth rate higher than that of such BmN4 cells. In addition, AcNPV has ability to transmit to human liver cells and human embryonic kidney cells. Thus, an AcNPV vector is preferable. As a host, \nSpodoptera Frugiperda \ncell lines Sf9 and Sf21 have been established from the ovarian tissues of \nS. frugiperda \nlarva Such cell lines are available from several manufacturers such as Invitrogen or Pharmingen (San Diego, Calif.), or are also available from ATCC. Otherwise, it is also possible to use a living insect larva as a host cell line.\n\n\nA recombinant virus used in the present invention may be constructed according to a common method. A recombinant virus can be constructed by the following procedures, for example. First, a protein gene to be expressed is inserted into a transfer vector, so as to construct a recombinant transfer vector. The total size of a transfer vector is generally between approximately several kb to 10 kb. Approximately 3 kb out of the size is a skeleton derived from a plasmid, and it comprises an antibiotic resistance gene that is resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin and an initiation signal in bacteria DNA replication. A common transfer vector comprises the 5′- and 3′-regions of a polyhedron gene (several kb for each), as well as the aforementioned skeleton. A homologous recombination occurs in these sequences between a gene of interest and the polyhedron gene, when transfection as described below is carried out. Moreover, such a transfer vector preferably comprises a promoter for expression of a protein gene. Examples of such a promoter include a polyhedron gene promoter, a p10 gene promoter, and a capsid gene promoter. The type of such a transfer vector is not particularly limited. Specific examples of a transfer vector include: AcNPV transfer vectors such as pEVmXIV2, pAcSG1, pVL1392/1393, pAcMP2/3, pAcJP1, pAcUW21, pAcDZ1, pBlueBacIII, pAcUW51, pAcAB3, pAc360, pBlueBacHis, pVT-Bac33, pAcUW1, or pAcUW42/43; and BmNPV transfer vectors such as pBK283, pBK5, pBB30, pBE1, pBE2, pBK3, bPK52, pKBblue, pBKblue2, or pBF series (which are available from Funakoshi Corporation, Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., etc.).\n\n\nSubsequently, in order to produce a recombinant virus, the aforementioned recombinant transfer vector is mixed with a virus, and the mixture is then introduced into a cultured cell used as a host. Otherwise, the aforementioned transfer vector is introduced into a cultured cell used as a host, which has previously been infected with a virus. Thus, a homologous recombination is allowed to occur between the recombinant transfer vector and the virus genomic DNA, so as to construct a recombinant virus. Examples of the cultured cell used as a host herein include the aforementioned hosts. In general, the cultured insect cells (Sf9 cells, BmN cells, etc.) can be used. Culture conditions are selected by persons skilled in the art, as appropriate. Specifically, when Sf9 cells are used, it is preferable to carry out the culture around 28° C. in a medium that contains 10% fetal bovine serum. The thus constructed recombinant virus can be purified by a common method such as plaque assay. In the thus produced recombinant virus, foreign DNA is substituted with or inserted into the gene region of the polyhedron protein of a nuclear polyhedrosis virus, and thus a polyhedron cannot be formed. Accordingly, such a recombinant virus is easily distinguishable from a non-recombinant virus.\n\n\nIn the method of the present invention, the aforementioned suitable host (the cultured cells of \nSpodoptera frugiperda \ncell lines Sf9 and Sf21, insect larva, etc.) is infected with the aforementioned recombinant baculovirus. After a certain period of time (72 hours later, for example) has passed, an extracellular budded virus (budded virus, BV) can be recovered from the culture supernatant by a separation operation such as centrifugation. Such an extracellular budded baculovirus can be recovered as follows. First, the culture of the infected cells is centrifuged at 500 to 3,000 g, so as to recover a supernatant that contains an extracellular budded baculovirus. Thereafter, the supernatant is centrifuged at approximately 30,000 to 50,000 g, so as to obtain a precipitate that contains the extracellular budded baculovirus.\n\n\nExogenous expression of a protein is important for carrying out biological analysis. In the case of a membrane protein, however, because of the hydrophobic properties thereof, a suitable system capable of expressing a protein in an amount sufficient for the analysis has not yet been established. Under such circumstances, an expression system using baculovirus and insect cells is used as a system that is expected to enable high-quality expression for both water-soluble and membrane proteins. Such a baculovirus expression system is advantageous in that it enables posttranslational modification such as fatty acid acylation or phosphorylation, which does not generally occur in expression using \nEscherichia coli\n. In addition, when such a baculovirus expression system is compared with yeast, since the recovery of the expressed protein is not inhibited by a cell wall, differing from the case of yeast, the treatment of cells is comparatively easy. In the case of using animal cells, posttranslational modification necessary for functions is expected, but expression of a large amount of membrane protein is difficult. It has been reported that a high expression level is expected from the baculovirus expression system, but that premature proteins may increase at times, resulting in agglutination or decomposition.\n\n\nThe type of the antibody of the present invention is not particularly limited. Examples of an antibody used herein include a mouse antibody, a human antibody, a rat antibody, a rabbit antibody, a sheep antibody, a camel antibody, a chicken antibody, and a gene recombinant antibody that is artificially modified for the purpose of decreasing heterogenetic antigenecity to a human or other purposes, such as a chimeric antibody or a humanized antibody. Such a gene recombinant antibody can be produced by a known method. A chimeric antibody is an antibody consisting of the heavy-chain and light-chain variable region of a mammal antibody other than a human antibody, such as a mouse antibody, and the heavy-chain and light-chain constant region of a human antibody. DNA encoding the variable region of a mouse antibody is ligated to DNA encoding the constant region of a human antibody. The ligated product is then incorporated into an expression vector, and the vector is then introduced into a host, so as to obtain such a chimeric antibody. A humanized antibody is produced by transplanting the complementarity determining region (CDR) of a mammal antibody other than a human antibody, such as a mouse antibody, into the complementarity determining region of a human antibody. A common gene recombinant technique applied to produce such a humanized antibody is known. Specifically, a DNA sequence designed such that the CDR of a mouse antibody is ligated to the framework region (FR) of a human antibody is synthesized from several oligonucleotides produced such that they have an overlapped portion at the termiri thereof according to the PCR method. The obtained DNA is ligated to DNA encoding the constant region of a human antibody, and the thus ligated product is then incorporated into an expression vector. The thus obtained vector is introduced into a host, so that the host can produce a humanized antibody UP Patent No. 239400, International Publication WO96/02576, etc.).\n\n\nMoreover, a method of obtaining a human antibody is also known. For example, a human lymphocyte is sensitized with a desired antigen or a cell that expresses such a desired antigen in vitro. The sensitized lymphocyte is then fused with a human myeloma cell such as U266, so as to obtain a desired human antibody having bindability to an antigen (JP Patent Publication Kokoku) No. 1-59878 B (1989)). In addition, antigenic animal having all repertories of human antibody genes is immunized with a desired antigen, so as to obtain a desired human antibody (refer to WO93/12227, WO92/03918, WO94/02602, WO94/25585, WO96/34096, and WO96/33735). Moreover, a technique of obtaining a human antibody by panning a human antibody library is known. For example, the variable region of a human antibody is allowed to express on a phage as a single-stranded antibody (scFv) according to the phage display method, and a phage binding to an antigen can be selected. By analyzing the gene of the selected phage, a DNA encoding the variable region of a human antibody binding to an antigen can be determined. If the DNA sequence of scFv binding to such an antigen is determined, the obtained sequence is incorporated into a suitable expression vector, and as a result, a human antibody can be obtained. Such methods have already been known, and are described in WO92/01047, WO92/20791, WO93/06213, WO93/11236, WO93/19172, WO95/01438, and WO95/15388.\n\n\nFurthermore, the aforementioned antibodies may also be low molecular weight antibodies such as antibody fragments or modified antibodies, unless they lose the property of recognizing the entire length or a part of a protein encoded by a ROBO1 gene. Specific examples of an antibody fragment include Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)2, Fv, and Diabody. In order to obtain such an antibody fragment, a gene encoding such an antibody fragment may be constructed, it may be then introduced into an expression vector, and it may be then allowed to express in suitable host cells.\n\n\nAs a modified antibody, an antibody that binds to various types of molecules such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be used. Further, it is also possible to bind a radioisotope, a chemotherapeutic, or the like to an antibody. A radiolabeled antibody is particularly useful. Such a modified antibody can be obtained by chemical modification of the obtained antibody. It is to be noted that a method of modifying an antibody is known to persons skilled in the art.\n\n\nA method of producing the monoclonal antibody of the present invention and a hybridoma is known in the present technical field (Campbell, “Monoclonal Antibody Technology: Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,” Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 1984; St. Groth et al., J. Immunol. Methods 35: 1-21, 1980). A protein or a fragment thereof encoded by a DKK1 gene is used as an immunogen. Such an immunogen is subcutaneously or intraperitoneally injected into any given animal (a mouse, a rabbit, etc.) that is known to produce an antibody, so that the animal can be immunized. For such immunization, an adjuvant may also be used. Such an adjuvant is known to persons skilled in the art.\n\n\nA monoclonal antibody can be obtained by excising splenic cells from the immunized animal, and fusing the splenic cells with myeloma cells, so as to produce hybridoma cells that produce a monoclonal antibody. Methods well known in the present technical field, such as ELISA assay, Western blot analysis, radioimmunoassay, or FACS using cells that express ROBO1 on the surfaces thereof, can be used to select hybridoma cells that produce an antibody recognizing ROBO1. A hybridoma that secretes a desired antibody is cloned, and the cloned cells are then cultured under suitable conditions. Thereafter, the secreted antibodies are recovered and are then purified by a method well known in the present technical field, such as use of an ion-exchange column or affinity chromatography.\n\n\nDNA encoding such a monoclonal antibody can easily be isolated and sequenced by a commonly used method (for example, using an oligonucleotide probe capable of specifically binding to a gene encoding the heavy chain and light chain of a monoclonal antibody). A hybridoma cell is a preferred starting material of such DNA. Once such DNA is isolated, it is then inserted into an expression vector. Thereafter, the vector is introduced into host cells such as \nE. coli \ncells, COS cells, CHO cells, or myeloma cells that do not produce immunoglobulin unless they are transformed. Thereafter, a monoclonal antibody can be produced from the recombinant host cells.\n\n\nSince expression of a ROBO1 gene is accelerated in specific cancer tissues, the antibody of the present invention is also useful as a cancer diagnostic marker. A certain method such as the Western blot method, the ELISA method, or histological staining is applied to the antibody of the present invention, so that expression of a protein encoded by the ROBO1 gene can be detected in tissues or cells. A sample derived from the tissues of a subject (for example, a biopsy sample, a blood sample, etc.) is allowed to come into contact with the antibody of the present invention under conditions wherein an immune complex can be formed, and whether or not the aforementioned antibody binds to the aforementioned sample is determined. As a result, the presence or amount of a protein encoded by the ROBO1 gene contained in the aforementioned sample can be determined. Thereby, the diagnosis of cancer, the monitoring of progression or cure of cancer, and prediction of prognosis can be carried out. Examples of a biological sample include (a) tissues, (b) the culture of the collected tissues, (c) a tissue extract, (d) the sputum of a cancer patient, (e) urine, and (f) blood. The aforementioned tissues can also be corrected by biopsy. When the collected tissues are subjected to immunohistological staining, they can be embedded in paraffin or can be frozen before use.\n\n\nThe monoclonal antibody of the present invention capable of specifically recognizing ROBO1 existing on the surface of a cell can be labeled with a radioactive metal, and it can thereby be used as a tumor diagnostic agent used in PET. An example of such a radioactive metal used herein is \n64\nCu, but examples are not limited thereto. Of these, \n64\nCu is preferable.\n\n\nThe monoclonal antibody of the present invention that has been labeled with a radioactive metal can be mixed with, dissolved in, or emulsified in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and as a result, it can be used as a tumor diagnostic agent used in PET. For example, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, excipient, binder, stabilizer, dispersant, and other agents, the radioactive metal-labeled monoclonal antibody of the present invention can be processed into a dosage form such as an injection solution, a suspension, or an emulsion. In order to produce an injection solution, the radioactive metal-labeled monoclonal antibody of the present invention can be dissolved in an aqueous solution, and preferably in a Hanks' solution, a Ringer's solution, or a physiologically compatible buffer solution such as a physiological saline buffer. Moreover, the composition can adopt the form of a suspension, a solution, an emulsion, etc., in an oily or watery vehicle.\n\n\nThe administration route of a tumor diagnostic agent used in PET is not particularly limited. In general, such a tumor diagnostic agent can be administered via a parenteral administration route, and it can be administered in the form of an injection (subcutaneous injection, intravenous injection, intramuscular injection, intraperitoneal injection, etc.), or through the skin or mucosa, for example.\n\n\nThe dosage and the number of doses are different depending on the age of a patient, the body weight of a patient, the purpose of diagnosis, etc. In general, the monoclonal antibody of the present invention can be administered within the range between approximately 0.1 mg and 1,000 mg, and preferably between approximately 0.1 mg and 100 mg, per single administration per kg of body weight.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe present invention will be described more in detail below. However, these examples are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nProduction of anti-ROBO1 Monoclonal Antibody\n\n\n(A) Method\n\n\n(1) Isolation of ROBO1 cDNA\n\n\nThe cDNA of ROBO1 was isolated by the following method. Single stranded cDNA was prepared from Alexander cells. The prepared single stranded cDNA was used as a template, and amplification was carried out by the PCR method using the following two primers: RBV2F-TA (5′-ACCATGATTGCGGAGCCCGCTCAC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 1)) and RBR-TA (5′-GCTTTCAGOTTCCTCTAATTC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 2)). The primer RBV2F-TA was designed such that it would hybridize with the 5′-terminus of a ROBO1 gene (GenBank: NM\n—\n133631). On the other hand, the primer RBR-TA was designed such that it would hybridize with the 3′-terminus thereof. In the PCR method, a reaction solution was prepared in accordance with the protocols of a LA-PCR kit (manufactured by TAKARA). A primary denaturation was first carried out at 95° C. for 2 minutes. Thereafter, a cycle consisting of 94° C.-15 seconds, 63° C.-15 seconds and 72° C.-5 minutes was repeated 30 times. Finally, an elongation reaction was carried out at 72° C. for 10 minutes. Subsequently, a band of approximately 5 kbp corresponding to an estimated ROBO1 sequence was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis. Such a specific amplified fragment was inserted into pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO (manufactured by Invitrogen) by the TA cloning method. As a result of confirming the nucleotide sequence by a common method, it became clear that the isolated cDNA was ROBO1 (ROBO1/pcDNA3.1).\n\n\n(2) Production of gp64-bound recombinant baculovirus, in which ROBO1 extracellular region domain is expressed\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 1\n, five types of antigens including a region comprising the initial immunoglobulin region (Ig1) were designed from the N-terminus of ROBO1, and such antigens were allowed to express in the forms of fusion proteins with the membrane protein pg64 of baculovirus. That is to say, using the primer sets as described below, and also using the aforementioned ROBO1 cDNA as a template, a gene encoding each region of ROBO1 was amplified by the PCR method, and the thus amplified product was then inserted into a pGEM-Te vector (manufactured by Promega). The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by a common method. Thereafter, a gene fragment cleaved with the restriction enzyme KpnI was inserted into a pBacSurf vector (manufactured by Novagen), so as to construct transfer vectors ROBO1N/pBS, gp1/pBS, gp2/pBS, gp3/pBS, and gp4/pBS. Subsequently, 4 μg of each vector was cleaved with the restriction enzyme BpII (manufactured by Fermentas) so as to create a straight chain. The vector was then introduced together with Bac-N-Blue DNA into Sf9 cells in accordance with the instructions of Invitrogen, so as to prepare a fusion protein-expressing recombinant baculovirus consisting of each ROBO1 domain (Ig1, Ig2, Ig3, Fn1, or Fn3) and gp64.\n\n\nThe thus prepared recombinant virus was added to Sf9 cells (2×10\n6 \ncells/ml) such that MOI became 5, so that the aforementioned cells became infected with the aforementioned recombinant virus. Thereafter, the infected cells were cultured at 27° C. for 3 days. After the culture has been carried out for 3 days, a budded baculovirus (BV) that expressed a fusion protein consisting of each ROBO1 domain and gp64 was recovered from the culture supernatant. That is to say, the culture solution was centrifuged at 1,500×g for 15 minutes, so as to eliminate cells and cell disintegrated products. The recovered culture supernatant was then centrifuged at 45,000×g for 30 minutes. The obtained precipitate was suspended in PBS, and the suspension was further centrifuged at 1,500×g, so as to eliminate cell components. The supernatant was again centrifuged at 45,000×g, and the obtained precipitate was then suspended in PBS. The thus obtained fraction was defined as a BV fraction, which was then used as an antigen in immunization.\n\n\nAll protein concentrations were assayed using a DC protein assay kit (Bio-rad) obtained by modification of the Lowry method. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a standard of protein assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPrimer sets\n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 3)\n \n \n \n \n \nROBO1N-F:\n \n5′-GGTACCCCTTCGTCAGGAAGATTTTCCAC-3′\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 4)\n \n \n \n \n \nROBO1N-R:\n \n5′-GGTACCGAGTAATTCCTTGCTACACA-3′\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 5)\n \n \n \n \n \nGp1-F:\n \n5′-GGTACCCGATGAAGGAGTCTATGTCTGTGT-3′\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 6)\n \n \n \n \n \nGp1-R:\n \n5′-GGTACCGCACCAACACAAACATATTTGCCA-3′\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 7)\n \n \n \n \n \nGp2-F:\n \n5′-GGTACCCACCAATATGGTTGGGGAACGTGA-3′\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 8)\n \n \n \n \n \nGp-2-R:\n \n5′-GGTACCGCAGATGCTTCAGCTTTGCCCACC-3′\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 9)\n \n \n \n \n \nGp3-F:\n \n5′-GGTACCCGCTAATGCATATGGAATTAGTGA-3′\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 10)\n \n \n \n \n \nGp3-R:\n \n5′-GGTACCGCATTCTTGGATACAGTTACACCT-3′\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 11)\n \n \n \n \n \nGp4-F:\n \n5′-GGTACCCGCACCCAGTGCCCCACCCCAAGG-3′\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(SEQ ID NO: 12)\n \n \n \n \n \nGp4-R:\n \n5′-GGTACCGCATCTGAAATCTGCTGAGCGAGG-3′\n \n \n \n \n \n\n(3) Production of full-length ROBO1-expressing virus\n\n\n\nThe ROBO1 cDNA comprising the fill-length ORF region described in (1) above was directly inserted into a pBlueBac4.5-TOPO vector, and the sequence was then analyzed. Thereafter, a transfer vector ROBO1/pBB having a correct nucleotide sequence was produced. Using 4 Mg of ROBO1/pBB, a recombinant baculovirus was produced in the same above manner. A BV fraction was prepared in the same manner as described in (2) above, and it was used as an antigen in immunization.\n\n\n(4) Detection of recombinant antigen by western blot method\n\n\nIn order to confirm expression of various types of the prepared BV antigens, detection was carried out by the Western blot analysis. Each of the aforementioned BV antigens was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, so as to separate a protein, followed by transcription on Hybond-P (manufactured by Amersham Biosciences). An anti-gp64 antibody (Tanaka T. et al., J Atheroscler Thrombo, 9: 233-242, 2002) was diluted by a factor of 50,000, and it was used as a primarily antibody. As a secondary antibody, an HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (manufactured by the Jackson Laboratory) was used. Detection was carried out using ECL plus (manufactured by Amersham Biosciences).\n\n\n(5) Production of recombinant soluble-type ROBO1 (sROBO1-His)\n\n\nSoluble-type ROBO1 (sROBO1-His) formed by adding a His tag to the C-terminus of the extracellular region of ROBO1 was produced as follows, and it was used as an antigen in ELISA during the screening of an antibody.\n\n\nThe ROBO1 cDNA described in (1) above was used as a template, and a gene encoding the extracellular region was amplified by the PCR method using the primer RBV2F-TA (5′-ACCATGATTGCGGAGCCCGCTCAC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 13) and the primer RB_SH_TA (5′-GGCCGGCTGCTTCACCACAT-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 14). The PCR product was directly inserted into a pBlueBac4.5-TOPO vector, and the sequence was then analyzed. Thereafter, a transfer vector ROBO1/pBB having a correct nucleotide sequence was produced. Using 4 μg of ROBO1/pBB, a recombinant baculovirus was produced in the same above manner.\n\n\nSubsequently, sROBO1-His was prepared as follows. That is, sf9 cells having a concentration of 2×10\n6\n/ml were infected with sROBO1-His-expressing recombinant baculoviruses, such that MOI became 5. The thus infected cells were cultured at 27° C. for 3 days. Thereafter, the culture supernatant was recovered. The sROBO1-His contained in the culture supernatant was purified using Ni-NTA superflow (QIAGEN) in accordance with protocols included with the kit. The purified product was concentrated using Centricon-10 (manufactured by Amicon), and the buffer was substituted with PBS, so as to prepare sROBO1-His.\n\n\n(6) Establishment of ROBO1 constant expression cell line\n\n\n1 μg of the ROBO1/pcDNA3.1 produced in (1) above was introduced into 2×10\n5 \nHEK293 cells (a 6-well plate was used), using 3 μl of FuGene6 reagent (manufactured by Roche Diagnostics). Three days after introduction of the expression vector, the medium was exchanged with a fresh one. Neomycin (Geneticin; GIBCO) was added in a concentration of 500 μg/ml to DMEM+10% FCS, and drug selection was carried out using neomycin. Such drug selection was carried out for 1 month, so as to carry out the monocloning of ROBO1-expressing HEK293 cells.\n\n\n(7) Production of Anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibody (BV antigen)\n\n\nROBO1-N (Ig1), gp1 (g2), gp2 (Ig3), and gp4 (Fn3), which were the BV antigens prepared in (2) above, and full-length expression type BV (ROBO1-Full), were used as antigens to produce anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibodies. That is, each BV antigen corresponding to 1 mg of protein suspended in PBS was mixed with 200 ng of pertussis toxin, and the mixture was then injected into the subcutis of a gp64 transgenic mouse (WO03/104453) for the initial immunization. Such a gp64 excessive expression transgenic mouse is a mouse in which gp64 has been allowed to systemically express using a pCAGGS vector.\n\n\nFor the subsequent immunization, only the BV antigen corresponding to 500 μg of protein was injected into the subcutis of the aforementioned mouse. For the final immunization, 250 μg of each BV antigen was injected into the vein of the aforementioned mouse. Three days after the final immunization, splenic cells were isolated from the mouse, and the thus isolated splenic cells were then fused with mouse P3U1 cells according to a common method, so as to establish a hybridoma cell line. Such hybridomas were selected with each screening system including the following ELISA as a typical example.\n\n\nEach monoclonal antibody was prepared from the culture supernatant of the generated hybridoma cells according to the ammonium sulfate precipitation method. In addition, the isotype of a mouse antibody was identified using Mouse Monoclonal Antibody Isotyping Test Kit MMT1 (manufactured by Serotec; distributed by Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co.).\n\n\n(8) ELISA Screening of hybridoma supernatant\n\n\nHybridoma cells that produced anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibodies were selected by ELISA in which sROBO1-His had been immobilized. In the ELISA method, 50 μl (5 μg/ml) of sROBO1-His was left on a 96-well flat plate (manufactured by Falcon) at 4° C. over day and night. Thereafter, the resultant was blocked in a TBS buffer that contained a 40% BlockAce reagent (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co.), and a hybridoma culture supernatant was added thereto, followed by a reaction at room temperature for 1 hour. Subsequently, an HRP-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (manufactured by Jackson) was allowed to react with the reaction product at room temperature for 1 hour. The resultant was washed 4 times, and it was then allowed to react with a 3,3′,5,5′-etramethylbenzidine (I) reagent (manufactured by Sigma) at room temperature for 1 hour. The reaction was terminated with 0.5 N sulfuric acid, and the absorbance at 491 nm was measured with a microplate reader MultickanJX (manufactured by Labsystems).\n\n\nIn addition, in the case of immunization with a BV antigen, 50 μl of BV antigen (50 μg/ml) used as an immunogen was left on a 96-well flat plate (manufactured by Falcon) at 4° C. over day and night, so that it became immobilized thereon. Thereafter, the ELISA assay was carried out in the same above manner. Wild-type BV was used as a control.\n\n\n(9) FACS screening of hybridoma supernatant\n\n\nIn order to screen an antibody that recognizes a steric structure, a hybridoma supernatant was screened by FACS analysis. That is, ROBO1-forced expression HEK293 cells or HEK293 cells used as negative controls were suspended in a FACS solution (1% albumin and 0.1% NaN\n3 \nin PBS). Thereafter, 10 μl of hybridoma supernatant was added to the cell suspension, and the obtained mixture was then allowed to react at 4° C. for 60 minutes. Thereafter, the reaction solution was washed with a FACS solution twice, and a FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (manufactured by Jackson) was added thereto. The obtained mixture was allowed to react at 4° C. for 30 minutes. Thereafter, the resultant was washed with a FACS solution twice, and the FACS analysis was then carried out using FACSCalibur (manufactured by Becton Dickinson) in accordance with instructions for use.\n\n\n(10) FMAT 8200 CDS screening\n\n\nFMAT 8200 CDS, which was based on Cell ELISA, was used to screen a hybridoma supernatant. That is, 1×10\n4 \nROBO1-expressing HEK293 cells were cultured on a 96-well Black plate used for FMAT assay over day and night, and on the following day, the buffer was exchanged with 100 μl of assay buffer (1% BSA+0.01% azide/PBS). Thereafter, 10 μl of hybridoma supernatant and 50 μl of FMAT Blue-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (final concentration: 1 μg/ml; Applied Biosystems) were added to each well, and it was then left at rest at room temperature in a dark room for 2 hours. Thereafter, detection was conducted with 8200 CDS. The fluorescence intensity ratio was compared with that of a negative control (without supernatant), and positive determination was carried out.\n\n\n(11) Production of anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibody (sROBO1-His antigen)\n\n\nThe sROBO1-His prepared in (5) above was used as an antigen to produce an anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibody. That is, an sROBO1-His antigen corresponding to 100 μg of protein suspended in PBS was mixed with 200 ng of pertussis toxin, and the mixture was then injected into the subcutis of an MRL/lpr mouse that was an autoimmune disease mouse for the initial immunization. For the subsequent immunization, an sROBO1-His antigen corresponding to 50 μg of protein was injected into the subcutis of the \naforementioned mouse\n 4 to 6 times. For the final immunization, 50 μg of sROBO1-His antigen was injected into the vein of the aforementioned mouse. Three days after the final immunization, splenic cells were isolated from the mouse, and the thus isolated splenic cells were then fused with mouse P3U1 cells by a conventional method, so as to establish a hybridoma cell line.\n\n\nSubsequently, screening was carried out by the same above-described method.\n\n\n(B) Results\n\n\n(1) Cloning of ROBO1 and production of expression vector\n\n\nROBO1 cDNA was amplified by PCP An animal cell expression vector ROBO1/pcDNA3.1 and an insect cell expression transfer vector ROBO1/pBB were produced. V5 and a His6 tag were added to the C-terminus of each of the two vectors, respectively. In addition, there was produced a transfer vector sROBO1/pBB used in expression of soluble-type ROBO1 (1-862 amino acids, sROBO1-His) that was cleaved on the N-terminal side of a transmembrane region.\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 1\n, 5 types of gp64-bound antigens, including a region comprising the initial immunoglobulin region (Ig1) from the N-terminus of ROBO1 as a typical example, were designed. At the final stage, a sequence comprising each domain of interest was inserted into a pBacSurf vector (manufactured by Novagen), so as to construct transfer vectors ROBO1N/pBS, gp1/pBS, gp2/pBS, gp3/pBS, and gp4/pBS.\n\n\nThe cDNA sequence of ROBO1 differs from the sequence registered at GenBank, and VGS was inserted into a certain site after the amino acid at position 309 after the third immunoglobulin domain (\nFIG. 2\n). It is considered that this was caused by mutation in Alexander cells used as a template. Insertion of 3 amino acids was observed in all cDNA cloned from the cDNA portions of fetal liver, fetal brain, HuH6, etc.\n\n\n(2) Confirmation of expression of antigenic protein\n\n\nVarious types of recombinant viruses were constructed as antigens used in immunization. Thereafter, each expression was confirmed by the Western blot analysis. As a result, as shown in \nFIGS. 3A and 3B\n, it was found that ROBO1N_BV, gp1_BV, gp2_BV, and gp4_BV were all successfully expressed. However, expression of gp3 encoding the third position of an immunoglobulin domain was not confirmed (\nFIG. 3A\n). Thus, hereafter, pg3 was excluded from immunogens.\n\n\nROBO1-Full_BV, wherein not a gp64-bound type but full-length ROBO1 was allowed to express, is shown in \nFIG. 3B\n. Moreover, with regard to sROBO1-His, \n \nfractions\n \n 2 and 3 as shown in \nFIG. 4\n, which had been purified with a Ni-NTA column, were combined, so as to produce a purified product.\n\n\n(3) Production of ROBO1 constant expression HEK293 cells\n\n\nROBO1/pcDNA3.1 was used to establish ROBO1 constant expression cells. 1 μg of ROBO1/pcDNA3.1 was introduced into 2×10\n5 \nHEK293 cells, using 3 μl of FuGene6 reagent (manufactured by Roche Diagnostics). Two days later, neomycin (500 μg/ml, Geneticin, GIBCO) was added to the medium, and further 1 week later, selection was carried out by 1 cell/well limiting dilution. Thereafter, the monocloned cells, which had acquired ability to tolerate neomycin, were recovered, and each RIPA lysate solution was prepared. 2 μg (equal amount) of the lysate solution corresponding to protein amount was supplied to each lane, and the Western blot analysis was then carried out (\nFIG. 5\n). Using, as an indicator, a band probably indicating the molecular weight of ROBO1 detected using A7241A as an anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibody, an anti-V5 antibody, etc., a comparison was made. As a result, it was revealed that expression of ROBO1 in \nR#\n6, \nR#\n10 and \nR#\n12 was higher than in the case of other clones.\n\n\nContinuously, FACS analysis was carried out using an anti-V5 antibody. Since a V5 tag was added to the C-terminus of the intracellular region of ROBO1, a FACS solution that contained 0.1% saponin was used during addition of a primary antibody, such that the antibody could detect the V5 tag in cells. As a result, no shifts were observed in the HEK293 cells used as a control, whereas a specific peak shift to the V5 antibody was observed in the case of the ROBO1-expressing cell \nlines R#\n6, \nR#\n10 and R#12 (\nFIG. 5\n). As a result of the aforementioned analysis, \nR#\n6, the expression level of which was highest in the comparison performed in the Western blot analysis, was defined as a ROBO1-expressing HEK293 cell line.\n\n\n(4) Production of anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibody\n\n\nAs shown in Table 1, various types of antigens were combined with a mouse to produce a large number of anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHybridoma serum\n\n\nScreening\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode No.\n\n\nImmunization antigen\n\n\nMouse\n\n\nn\n\n\nCD40L\n\n\nconcentration\n\n\nnumber (Well)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nA7200\n \n \nROBO1N_BV\n\n\ngp64TGM\n \n \n\n\n2\n\n\n—\n\n\n15% FCS\n\n\n1248\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB0700\n\n\nsROBO1\n\n\nMRL/\nIpr\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n—\n\n\n15% FCS\n\n\n864\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB1500/B1600\n\n\nsROBO1\n\n\nMRL/\nIpr\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n—\n\n\nCS.

All restrictions upon public access to the deposited material will be irrevocably removed upon the grant of a patent on this application.\n\n\n(C) Consideration\n\n\nSince human ROBO1 showed extremely high amino acid sequence homology of 95% or more with a mouse, and since an epitope portion of interest was an extracellular region, with regard to production of an antibody, a method of obtaining such an antibody was devised. That is to say, two types of methods, namely, a method of immunizing a gp64 expression transgenic mouse with a BV antigen and a method of immunizing an MRL/lpr mouse with a soluble-type ROBO1 purified antigen (sROBO1-His) were applied in the present studies.\n\n\nIn order to enhance the antigenecity of an immunogen, a BV antigen is used in the form of a virus for immunization. However, in such a case, large quantities of antibodies reacting with gp64 that is a main component of the virus may possibly be produced. Thus, in the present invention, gp64 excessive expression transgenic mice were used, and an attempt was made to obtain large quantities of antibodies reacting with antigens of interest.\n\n\nMoreover, to date, MRL/lpr mice have been widely studied as models of systemic autoimmune diseases such as human lupus nephritis, polyarteritis nodosa, rheumatoid arthritis, or Sjogren's syndrome. We expected that an antibody more unique than that obtained from a common mouse could be obtained, when such autoimmune disease mice were immunized with ROBO1 that was predicted to have low antigenecity. Thus, we selected this method.\n\n\nAs a result of performing the two above strategies, as shown in Table 2, a great number of anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibodies, including antibodies that recognized a steric structure, were successfully produced. A simple comparison could not be made between the two methods because different immunogens were used in such methods. However, when compared with other types of mice, MRL/lpr mice were greatly damaged during immunization. Thus, the MRL/lpr mice required careful handling.\n\n\nThe number of positive clones was largely different depending on the type of screening. The used immunogen was considered to be one of the factors. At least, acquisition of a FACS positive antibody reacting with an immunoglobulin domain has not yet been confirmed so far. This region is a ROBO1 ligand-binding region, and the highest homology was conserved in this region regardless of species. Thus, it was anticipated that this became immunologically tolerant, and therefore it was considered difficult to produce such an antibody. Moreover, there was a possibility that that a ROBO1-like protein contained in bovine serum reacted as an absorption component when an anti-ROBO1 antibody was screened. Thus, it was predicted that antibodies that well recognized a steric structure failed to be screened.\n\n\nAs another factor, there was a possibility that the steric structure of a gp64-bound antigen used as an antigen differed from that of ROBO1. An S—S bond exists in each immunoglobulin domain. There was a possibility that such an S—S bond was not reconstructed when it was fused with gp64. In reality, Cys considered to be necessary for reconstruction was conserved in each immunoglobulin domain and was used for designing. However, it was also considered that it was influenced by the structure of gp64.\n\n\nFor the aforementioned reasons, the following two creative efforts were made in production of antibodies in B52 and 53 series. That is, CS having a few bovine ROBO1-like proteins in serum was used instead of FBS in the screening of hybridomas, and a ROBO1-Full/BV antigen, wherein the steric structure of an immunoglobulin domain was possibly maintained, was used as an immunogen. As a result, the number of FACS positive antibodies established was clearly increased (Tables 1 and 2). In the present invention, using this system, an antibody exhibiting high cytotoxicity was successfully isolated in the last result.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nCharacterization of Anti-ROBO1 Monoclonal Antibody using Cytotoxicity (CDC Activity) as Indicator\n\n\n(A) Method\n\n\n(1) FACS analysis of anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibody\n\n\nAn anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibody was analyzed in accordance with the method described in the “FACS screening of hybridoma supernatant” section in Example 1. The fluorescence intensity was converted to numbers (X mean) and then used.\n\n\n(2) Measurement of CDC activity of anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibody\n\n\nCalcein (Wako)-labeled ROBO1-expressing HEK293 cells were used in analysis. Specific operations are as follows.\n\n\n(i) Production of human albumin veronal buffer (HAVB)\n\n\n12.75 g of NaCl (highest quality; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), 0.5625 g of Na-barbital (highest quality; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), and 0.8625 g of barbital (highest quality; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) were dissolved in Milli-Q water, resulting in a volume of 200 ml. The obtained solution was then subjected to an autoclave treatment (121° C., 20 minutes). Thereafter, 100 ml of warm Milli-Q water, which had been treated with an autoclave, was added to the resultant solution. The pH of the solution was found to be pH 7.43 (recommended pH: 7.5). The thus obtained solution was defined as a 5× veronal buffer. 0.2205 g of CaCl\n2\n.2H\n2\nO (highest quality; Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd.) was dissolved in 50 ml of Milli-Q water, resulting in a concentration of 0.03 mol/l, and the obtained solution was defined as a CaCl solution. 1.0165 g of MgCl\n2\n.6H\n2\nO (highest quality; Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd.) was dissolved in 50 ml of Milli-Q water, resulting in a concentration of 0.1 mol/l, and the obtained solution was defined as an MgC\n2 \nsolution. 100 ml of 5× veronal buffer, 4 ml of human serum albumin (Buminate (registered trademark) 25%, 250 mg/ml human serum albumin; Baxter), 2.5 ml of CaCl\n2 \nsolution, 2.5 ml of MgCl\n2 \nsolution, 0.1 g of KCl (highest quality; Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd.), and 0.5 g of glucose (D(+)-glucose; anhydrous glucose; highest quality; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) were dissolved in Milli-Q water, resulting in a volume of 500 ml. The obtained solution was defined as HAVB. HAVB was filtrated and sterilized, and it was then conserved at a preset temperature of 5° C.\n\n\n(ii) Preparation of target cells\n\n\nROBO1 forced expression HEK293 cells and ALX were cultured in DMEM medium/10% FBS (SIGMA) (0.5 mg/ml neomycin (Geneticin, GIBCO) was added to ROBO1-expressing HEK293 cells). Thereafter, the cells were removed from the dish using a cell desquamation buffer (GIBCO). The cells were then poured into each well of a 96-well U bottom plate (BECTON DICKINSON) in a concentration of 1×10\n4 \ncells/well, and they were then cultured overnight. After completion of the culture, 5.55 MBq of chrome-51 or a calcein reagent (Wako) having a final concentration of 20 μg/ml was added to the culture, and the obtained mixture was then cultured in a 5% carbon dioxide incubator at 37° C. for 1 hour. The resultant cells were washed with HAVB twice, and 50 μl of HAVB was added thereto to produce target cells.\n\n\n(iii) Preparation of baby rabbit complement\n\n\n1 vial of baby rabbit complement (Cedarlane) was dissolved in 1 ml of distilled water used for injection (Fuso Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.) so as to prepare a complement solution (a complement itself was prepared before use for a test).\n\n\n(iv) Measurement of CDC activity\n\n\nAn anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibody was diluted with HAVB so as to prepare an antibody solution, and 50 μl each of such an antibody solution was added to target cells. The obtained mixture was left at rest on ice for 15 minutes (final concentration: 0.16 μg/ml to 100 μg/ml). Subsequently, a complement solution was added in a concentration of 100 μg/ml to each well (final concentration: 5% to 25%). The obtained mixture was left at rest in a 5% carbon dioxide incubator at 37° C. for 90 minutes. The plate was centrifuged, and 100 μl each of supernatant was then recovered from each well. Thereafter, the radioactivity thereof was measured using a gamma counter (measured at 494 nm in the case of calcein labeling). A specific chrome release rate was obtained using the following formula:\n\n\nSpecific chrome release rate(%)=(\nA−C\n)/(\nB−C\n)×100\n\n\nA indicates radioactivity (cpm) in each well; B indicates the mean value of radioactivity (cpm) in a well, wherein 100 μl of 2% NP-40 aqueous solution (Nonidet P-40, Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) and 50 μl of HAVB were added to target cells; and C indicates the mean value of radioactivity (cpm) in a well, wherein 150 μl of HAVB was added to target cells. The test was carried out in a triple manner, and the mean value and standard deviation of CDC activity (%) were calculated.\n\n\n(3) Epitope analysis of anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibody\n\n\n\nROBO1 has 5 immunoglobulin domains and 3 fibronectin III domains in the extracellular region thereof. Thus, antigens used in epitope analysis were designed such that they were overlapped each other, and they were allowed to express as GST-bound recombinants (\nFIG. 6\n). In addition to the 8 antigens, 30 amino acids located upstream of a transmembrane region (UT1_GST, 831-860 amino acids), Ig2-3 obtained by combining the second immunoglobulin domain with the third immunoglobulin domain, and Ig4-5 obtained by combining the fourth immunoglobulin domain with the fifth immunoglobulin domain, were prepared (total 11 types). That is to say, using the primer sets as described below, a gene fragment of interest was cloned by the PCR method, and it was then inserted into the BamHI-HindIII site of a pET41b vector (total 11 vectors ranging from Ig1/pET41b to UT1/pET41b). BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) was transformed with each expression vector. A cell mass whose expression had been induced in 0.5 M IPTG at 37° C. for 3 hours was disintegrated with ultrasonic wave using 1% Triton X-100/PBS. The thus obtained insoluble fraction and soluble fraction were used as antigens in epitope analysis.

Continuously, the antibody concentration was set at 2 μg/ml, and antibodies produced in B47, B52 and B53 series as ROBO1-Full_BV/gp64TGM immunity series (Table 1) were subjected to FACS analysis (\nFIG. 7B\n). The concentration-dependent curves of main antibodies are shown in \nFIG. 7C\n. From the aforementioned analysis, it became clear that a large number of antibodies exhibiting high affinity for ROBO1 on the cell surface are contained in the B47, B52 and B53 series.\n\n\n(2) Comparison of CDC activities of anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibodies\n\n\nThe antibody volume-dependent CDC activities of B2318C, B1511A and B2610A were evaluated (\nFIG. 8A\n). The same tendency as that in the FACS analysis as shown in \nFIG. 7A\n was obtained also in the measurement of such CDC activities. It became clear that B1511A and B2610A had cytotoxicity at a low volume, when compared with B2318C.\n\n\nConsidering the aforementioned analytical results, the CDC activity of an anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibody in a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml was compared with that in a concentration of 1.0 μg/ml (\nFIG. 9\n). As a result, it was demonstrated that B5209B, B5303A and B5317B had activities stronger than any antibodies that had previously been obtained. Continuously, a comparison was made among the aforementioned antibodies and the B2318 antibody in terms of evaluation of antibody concentration-dependent CDC activities (\nFIG. 8B\n). As a result, it became clear that B5209B (IgG2b) had the highest CDC activity.\n\n\n(3) Epitope analysis of anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibody\n\n\nExpression of various types of GST-bound proteins as shown in \nFIG. 6\n was analyzed. In the case of Ig2_GST and Ig5_GST, no proteins were detected in both soluble and insoluble fractions, and thus other types of GST-bound proteins were used in epitope analysis (Ig2_GST and Ig4-5_GST). The results obtained by detection of expression of each domain with an anti-GST antibody are shown in \nFIG. 10\n. Except for Ig3_GST, only trace amounts of immunoglobulin domains Ig1, 2-3, 4, and 4-5_GST were detected in soluble fractions. Thus, insoluble fractions were used in epitope analysis. For fibronectin III domains Fn1, 2, 3_GST, and UT1_GST, soluble fractions were used.\n\n\nFirst, B2318C, B2212A and B2610A, which were antibodies obtained by immunization with gp4_BV, were subjected to epitope analysis. As shown in \nFIG. 6\n, since an antigen portion comprises a site ranging from upstream of a transmembrane region to the third fibronectin III domain (738-855 amino acids), epitope analysis was carried out by the Western blot method using Fn3_GST and UT1_GST. As a result, as shown in \nFIG. 11A\n, all sites did not bind to UT1_GST, but bound to Fn3. Thus, it became clear that each recognition site was the third fibronectin III domain.\n\n\nSubsequently, antibodies obtained in the B47, B52 and B53 series obtained by immunization of gp64TGM with a ROBO1-Full_BV antigen were subjected to epitope analysis using each GST antigen. As a representative example of the results of the Western blot analysis, a blot view of the B5317B antibody is shown in \nFIG. 11B\n. Finally, the binding domains of all the antibodies were identified. The results are summarized in Table 3. As a result of the immunization with ROBO1-Full_BV, there was a possibility that an antibody binding to any portion of an extracellular region was obtained. However, as a result, all antibodies other than the first fibronectin III domain of B5304A bound to the fifth immunoglobulin domain. Moreover, it was also found that the binding site of B1511 A (IgM) obtained by immunization of an MRL/lpr mouse with sROBO1-His was also the fifth immunoglobulin domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBinding\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAntibody\n \nAntigen\n \nregion\n \nSubclass\n \nLot\n \nWB\n \nFACS (nM)\n \nCDC (%)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA7241A\n \nROBO1N\n \n1st-Ig\n \nIgG1\n \nA-1\n \n+++\n \n—\n \nN.D.\n \n \n \nB1511A\n \nsROBO1-His\n \n5th-Ig\n \nIgM\n \nA-1\n \n+\n \n4.6\n \n41.5\n \n \n \nB2212A\n \nROBO1gp4\n \n3rd-FnIII\n \nIgG2a\n \nA-1\n \n+\n \n4.9\n \n36.2\n \n \n \nB2318C\n \nROBO1gp4\n \n3rd-FnIII\n \nIgG2a\n \nA-2\n \n++\n \n101.6\n \n27.7\n \n \n \nB2542A\n \nROBO1gp2\n \n3rd-Ig\n \nIgG3\n \nA-1\n \n+\n \n—\n \n—\n \n \n \nB2610A\n \nROBO1gp4\n \n3rd-FnIII\n \nIgG1\n \nA-1\n \n+\n \n6.1\n \n35.4\n \n \n \nB4704A\n \nROBO1-Full\n \n5th-Ig\n \nIgG2a\n \nA-1\n \n+\n \n140466.7\n \n58.8\n \n \n \nB5202A\n \nROBO1-Full\n \n5th-Ig\n \nIgG2a\n \nA-1\n \n+\n \n14.8\n \n58.7\n \n \n \nB5209B\n \nROBO1-Full\n \n5th-Ig\n \nIgG2b\n \nA-1\n \n++\n \n3.1\n \n87.2\n \n \n \nB5303A\n \nROBO1-Full\n \n5th-Ig\n \nIgG2a\n \nA-1\n \n++\n \n7.3\n \n79.2\n \n \n \nB5304A\n \nROBO1-Full\n \n1st-FnIII\n \nIgG2b\n \nA-1\n \n+\n \n954.7\n \n32.8\n \n \n \nB5309D\n \nROBO1-Full\n \n5th-Ig\n \nIgG2a\n \nA-1\n \n+\n \n70.4\n \n34.9\n \n \n \nB5310C\n \nROBO1-Full\n \n5th-Ig\n \nIgG1\n \nA-1\n \n+\n \n10.7\n \n—\n \n \n \nB5315C\n \nROBO1-Full\n \n5th-Ig\n \nIgG2a\n \nA-1\n \n+\n \n22.5\n \n51\n \n \n \nB5317B\n \nROBO1-Full\n \n5th-Ig\n \nIgG2b\n \nA-1\n \n+\n \n52.7\n \n86.4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFACS score: FACA analysis against ROBO1-expressing HEK cell; EC50(nM) obtained by digitizing signal intensity; IgG = 150 kD.\n \n \n \nCDC score: measured value (%) at 0.1 ug/mL\n \n \n \nN.D.: Not tested\n \n \n \nB2212A: It belongs to B2318 series (gb4_BV/gp64TGM + CD40L) due to error in picking up a clone.\n \n \n \nB2318C: It belongs to B2212 series (gb4_BV/gp64TGM) due to error in picking up a clone\n \n \n \n \n \n\n(C) Consideration\n\n\n\nAs a result of characterization of anti-ROBO1 monoclonal antibodies obtained in the present studies, the CDC activity of each antibody, the binding ability of each antibody to ROBO1 on the cell surface (FACS analysis), and a ROBO1-binding domain (epitope) were revealed. Among the three types of immunization methods conducted in the present studies, a method of immunizing gp64TGM with ROBO1-Full_BV was most successful in isolation of an antibody having cytotoxicity. Also, it is noteworthy that the used serum was changed from FCS (fetal calf serum) to CS (calf serum).\n\n\nIt was only the third fibronectin domain (gp4_BV) that succeeded in obtaining a FACS positive antibody during immunization of each ROBO1 domain with a gp64-bound antigen. In addition, with regard to GST-bound proteins used in epitope mapping, fibronectin domains easily became soluble in an \nEscherichia coli \nexpression system. In the case of immunoglobulin domains other than the third domain, the second and fifth domains were not expressed, and the first and fourth domains were insoluble. Taking into consideration such circumstances, it was suggested that partial expression was not preferable in production of an antibody reacting with a region wherein cysteine or the like has a great influence on a steric structure, such as an immunoglobulin domain.\n\n\nMoreover, the epitopes of antibodies having cytotoxicity obtained by immunization with antigens comprising the entire ROBO1 extracellular region, ROBO1-Full_BV and sROBO1-His, were all the fifth immunoglobulins except for 1 case (Table 3). Since FACS negative clones were not selected in a screening process, it is considered that in reality, there was a possibility that FACS negative antibodies that recognized other epitopes were produced in a mouse spleen. With regard to other sites (domains), there was a possibility that the steric structure of an immunogen was not similar to the steric structure of the cell surface. There was also a possibility that an antibody reacting with the fifth immunoglobulin was easily produced for some reason.\n\n\nUsing the produced antibody panel (Table 3), optimal epitope sites were analyzed. Three points, namely, the isotype of an antibody, the affinity of an antibody for ROBO1, and an antigen-binding site were considered to have an influence on the level of CDC activity or the like. Thus, by comparing two antibodies having the same isotype and the same level of affinity, an optimal antigen-binding site could be assumed. The isolated B2212A and B5303A were both IgG2a, and the affinity (EC50 value) in the FACS analysis was 7.3 nM and 4.9 nM, which were close values (\nFIG. 12A\n). The fact that the cytotoxicity of B5303A was clearly higher than that of B2212A (\nFIG. 12B\n) suggested that when the fifth fibronectin domain would be targeted, cytotoxicity would be easily induced, rather than when the third fibronectin domain would be targeted.\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nExtracorporeal Imaging of Tumor by PET\n\n\n(A) Method\n\n\n(1) \n18\nFDG Study\n\n\nAnimal used: 10\n7 \nHepG2 cells were transplanted into a 6-week-old BALB/cAjc1-nu/nu male mouse, so as to produce a xenograft model. When this model was subjected to an experiment, it was 9 week old, having a tumor size of 10×8 nm and a body weight of 25 g.\n\n\nAnesthesia: Isoflurane inhalation anesthesia was performed on the model, using a handmade inhalation anesthesia apparatus for small animals. The state of spontaneous respiration was monitored with a videocamera, and a breathing rate and an anesthetic concentration were recorded at regular intervals.\n\n\nHeat retention: In order to avoid a decrease in the body temperature, the model animal was prevented from directly coming into contact with the outside air using a handmade transparent cover. A small amount of halogen lamp light was indirectly applied from outside of the scanner for heat retention. The temperature in the room and that in the cover were recorded at regular intervals. Radiopharmaceutical used and administration method thereof: Approximately 0.8 mCi (10 MBq) of \n18\nFDG (\n18\nF half-life: 110 minutes) was administered via an intravenous line over approximately 1 minute using a handmade cannulation apparatus produced from a 27G needle.\n\n \n \nPhotographic device and PET data collection protocol: \nMicroPET Focus\n 120 manufactured by Siemens (\nFIG. 1\n, lower right) was used to collect dynamic image data at 20 sec×6, 60 sec×6, 2 min×6, and 5 min×8 (26 frames in total; 60 minutes).\n\n\n(2) \n64\nCu-DOTA-anti-Robo1 whole IgG mAb study\n\n\nAnimal used: The two above HepG2 cell xenograft models were used when they were 17 weeks old. The two model animals were subjected to fasting from the night before the first day of experiment until termination of the experiment on the first day. The tumor size of \nMouse#\n 1 and that of \nMouse#\n2 were 15 mm×13 mm and 18 mm×12 mm, respectively. For 5 days of the experiment (Jan. 16-20, 2007), the body weight of \nMouse#\n1 and that of \nMouse#\n2 were 22-26 g and 19-21 g, respectively. After completion of the experiment on the last day (Jan. 20, 2007), a tumor portion was excised, and it was then fixed with formalin. Portions other than the tumor portion were frozen for preservation.\n\n\nSynthesis of radiopharmaceutical: Positron nuclide \n64\nCu (half-life: 12.7 hours) was produced via a \n64\nNi(pn)\n64\nCu reaction at S. H. I. E. Examination & Inspection, Ltd. (Niihama-shi, Ehime). Subsequently, at the First Radioisotope (Matsuo-cho, Chiba), a \n \n \nbifunctional chelating agent\n \n \n 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) was introduced into anti-Robo1 mAb (the monoclonal antibody B5209B produced in Example 1) via a highly reactive isothiocyanate group. Finally, DOTA mAb was labeled with \n64\nCu, and the activity was then evaluated.\n\n\nSpecification of radiopharmaceutical: The radioactive concentration of the \n64\nCu-DOTA-anti-Robo1 whole IgG monoclonal antibody was 23.3 MBq/ml (in 511 KeV measurement, however, it was 16.4 MBq/ml). The amount of liquid administered was 0.8 ml (Mouse#1) and 0.5 ml (Mouse#2). When administered, it became approximately 9 MBq and 6 MBq (511 Kev window), respectively. The antibody concentration was 0.331 mg/ml.\n\n\nAnesthesia and heat retention: The anesthetic method and the heat retention method were the same as those in the FDG study. In order to collect MicroPET data, each mouse was subjected to several times of anesthesia\n\n\nPET data collection protocol: 0.8 ml of \n64\nCu-DOTA mAb solution was administered to \nMouse#\n1 via an indwelling venous line over 5 minutes. In addition, 0.5 ml of the solution was administered to \nMouse#\n2. Data collection was carried out from immediately after the administration to the 4\nth \nday, for 22.5 \nhours\n 8 times in total in the case of \nMouse#\n1, and for 18.5 \nhours\n 6 times in total in the case of \nMouse#\n2. The final scanning (data collection time: 8 hours) was carried out 4 days after the administration, namely, after the nude mouse had been subjected to euthanasia.\n\n\nImage reconstruction and image data analysis (outline): The collected PET data, both \nPart\n 1 and \nPart\n 2, were subjected to a series of treatments. Finally, the data were reconstructed to 3D or 4D image by the Filtered Back Projection method (in the case of dynamic data collection). Image display was set at a region of interest (ROI), and a time activity curve (TAC) was calculated using MicroPET software, AsiPro.\n\n\n(B) Results\n\n\n(1) \n18\nFDG Study\n\n \n\n\nThe image obtained 55-60 minutes after administration of \n18\nFDG to the HepG2 tumor nude mouse is shown in \nFIG. 13\n. It was confirmed that the level of \n18\nFDG accumulated in a HepG2 tumor portion is lower than the level of \n18\nFDG accumulated in a heart or a brain having high hexokinase activity, and that the level of \n18\nFDG accumulated in a HepG2 tumor portion is higher than that in a liver in which a \n18\nFDG metabolite is decomposed due to dephosphorylation.\n\n\nTotal 26 frames of dynamic images taken in the same coronal section from immediately after administration of \n18\nFDG until 60 minutes have passed are shown in \nFIG. 14\n. The bloodstream of renal artery in the bloodstream phase immediately after the administration (\nFIG. 14A\n), a tumor image at an initial stage (\nFIG. 14B\n), a urinary bladder imaged with RI egested into urine (\nFIG. 14C\n), accumulation of tumor considered to be due to the metabolic trapping of \n18\nFDG (\nFIG. 14D\n), accumulation of the agent in a liver (\nFIG. 14E\n), and accumulation of the agent in a cardiac muscle (\nFIG. 14F\n) were shown as RI dynamic images of the whole mouse body, without moving the bed to extend a scanning range.\n\n\nA time activity curve (TAC) was obtained from three regions of interest (ROI) that had been set to easily evaluate the drug disposition of \n18\nFDG in each organ, namely, a liver, a kidney, and a HepG2 tumor portion (\nFIG. 15\n). For 60 minutes after administration of \n18\nFDG, accumulation of the agent in the kidney was always highest. Accumulation of the agent in the HepG2 tumor was gradually increased, and approximately 12 minutes later, accumulation of the agent in the HepG2 tumor became higher than that in a normal liver.\n\n\nSupplement: Additional \n18\nFDG Study with lung cancer xenograft\n\n\nThe \n18\nFDG image in a lung squamous cell carcinoma QG-56 nude mouse that was taken 60 minutes later is shown in \nFIG. 16\n. On the PET image, a low level of the agent was accumulated in the lung squamous cell carcinoma xenograft, or no agents were accumulated therein. With regard to a tumor tissue cleavage plane, no solid tumor components were observed in the tumor.\n\n\n(2) \n64\nCu-DOTA-\nanti-Robo\n 1 whole IgG mAb Study\n\n\nPET images taken 6 hours, 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days after administration of \n64\nCu-DOTA-anti-Robo1 whole IgG mAb to \nMouse#\n1 are shown in \nFIG. 17\n. In the 6-hour image, accumulation of the agent in the HepG2 tumor was lower than the blood pool image in a cardiac lumen. However, accumulation of the agent in the tumor was gradually increased until 3 days after the administration. \n64\nCu-DOTA mAb non-specifically accumulated in the liver was slowly egested to an intestinal canal via a biliary system. No accumulation of the agent in a kidney and a urinary bladder were confirmed.\n\n\nPET images taken 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days after administration of \n64\nCu-DOTA-anti-Robo1 whole IgG mAb to \nMouse#\n2 are shown in \nFIG. 18\n. 1 day later, accumulation of the agent in the tumor was lower than accumulation of the agent in the normal liver, and distribution of \n64\nCu-DOTA-anti-Robo1 mAb could not confirmed in several portions of the tumor. Three days later, however, it was confirmed that the agent was distributed to the entire tumor volume at a high accumulation level.\n\n\nDistribution of \n64\nCu-DOTA-anti-Robol mAb (including a \n64\nCu-labeled decomposed product) in the body, when the two nude mice were subjected to euthanasia (Mouse #1: 87 hours later; and Mouse #2: 84 hours later), is shown in \nFIG. 19\n. Accumulation of the agent in the HepG2 tumor was highest among the organs of the entire body. It is reasonable to understand that accumulation of the agent in the HepG2 tumor is caused by the specific binding of a labeled antibody to a Robo1 antigen. Low levels of accumulations observed outside of the \nMouse #\n1 tumor accorded well with necrosis (approximately 30% of the entire tumor volume) that was macroscopically confirmed after completion of the PET experiment.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n shows the design of an antigen used to produce an anti-monoclonal antibody.\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n shows ROBO1 cloned from Alexander cells and ROBO1 deposited with GenBank under No. NM133631.\n\n\n \nFIG. 3\n shows the results obtained by confirming expression of various types of BV antigen by the Western blot method.

A indicates the bloodstream of renal artery, B indicates a tumor image at an initial stage, C indicates a urinary bladder imaged with RI egested into urine, D indicates a tumor image, E indicates accumulation of the agent in a liver, and F indicates accumulation of the agent in a cardiac muscle.\n\n\n \nFIG. 15\n shows an example of setting regions of interest on the PET image (left) comprising three different reconstruction cross-sections (coronal), and a time activity curve (right) obtained for 60 minutes from the time of administration of \n18\nFDG obtained from three regions of interest (ROI). The red arrows in the PET image (left) successively indicate the ROI of a liver, the ROI of a HepG2 tumor portion, and the ROI of a kidney, from the left. The x-axis of the time activity curve (TAC, right) indicates time (second), and y-axis indicates of the count rate of PET.\n\n\n \nFIG. 16\n shows \n18\nFDG MicroPET Supplementary Images (lung squamous cell carcinoma QG-56 nude mouse, the image obtained after 60 minutes). The red arrows as shown in the PET image (upper stage) and the photograph of the nude mouse (lower left stage) indicate lung squamous cell carcinoma xenografts. Looking at the \n18\nFDG PET image, the agent was accumulated in the tumor at a low level or was not accumulated at all (upper stage), and in the tumor tissue cleavage plane, no solid tumor components were observed in the tumor (lower right stage).\n\n\n \nFIG. 17\n shows MicroPET images obtained 6 hours, 1 day, 2 days and 3 days after administration of \n64\nCu-DOTA-anti-Robo1 whole IgG mAb, from the upper stage (in each of the aforementioned times, axial, coronal, sagital cross-section views are shown from the left, and the maximum accumulation in each time is indicated with a red of the Rainbow color scale, so that the results can be relatively shown). Accumulation of the agent in the tumor observed from the \nimage\n 6 hours after the administration was smaller than that of a cardiac lumen blood pool image. However, accumulation of the agent in the tumor was relatively increased. Accumulation of the agent in a liver was rather decreased, and it was egested to an intestinal canal. No images of a kidney and a urinary bladder were obtained. (D: doral, V: ventral, L: left, R: right, H: head, and T: tail).\n\n\n \nFIG. 18\n is a PET image showing a change over time in the accumulation of \n64\nCu-DOTA-anti-Robo1 mAb in Mouse #2 (upper stage: 1 day after, middle stage: 2 days after, lower stage: 3 days after the administration; and the yellow cross indicates tumor). 1 day after the administration, the accumulation level of the aforementioned agent into the tumor was lower than the accumulation level of the aforementioned agent into a normal liver. However, 3 days after the administration, accumulation of the agent in the tumor reached the highest level. From the image obtained 1 day after the administration, distribution of \n64\nCu-DOTA-anti-Robo1 mAb into the tumor was not clearly observed, but 8 days later, distribution of the aforementioned agent into the entire tumor volume was observed.\n\n\n \nFIG. 19\n shows distribution of \n64\nCu-DOTA-anti-Robo1 mAb (including a \n64\nCu-labeled decomposed product) in the body of each mouse, when the nude mice were subjected to euthanasia (upper stage: \nMouse #\n1, 87 hours later; and lower stages: \nMouse #\n2, 84 hours later). It is reasonable to understand that accumulation of the agent in the HepG2 tumor is caused by the specific binding of a labeled antibody to a Robo1 antigen. Low levels of accumulations observed outside of the \nMouse #\n1 tumor (upper left stage and center) are considered to be necrosis."
