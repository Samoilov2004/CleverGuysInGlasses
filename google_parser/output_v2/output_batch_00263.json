Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to pyrazine compounds that act as inhibitors of protein kinases, specially the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). The invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, and to the use of the compounds for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of hematological malignancies like AML, MLL, T-ALL, B-ALL and CMML, myeloproliferative disorders, other proliferative disorders like cancer, autoimmune disorders and skin disorders like psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein kinases are involved in the regulation of cellular metabolism, proliferation, differentiation and survival. Protein kinases phosphorylate proteins on serine/threonine or tyrosine residues. Activation of one class of kinase typically leads to activation of more than one signaling pathway through signaling crosstalk. The receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are a major type of cell-surface receptors, where the intracellular part of the receptor has a kinase domain. The activating ligands are peptide/protein hormones, like the FL-ligand, Vascular Endothelial Growth factor (VEGF), Epidermal Growth factor (EGF), Fibroblast growth factor (FGF), nerve growth factor (NGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin, etc. Binding of a ligand to the extracellular domain of an RTK results in receptor dimerisation and a conformational change that activates the kinase site on the intracellular domain. The kinase activity leads to a signal-transduction cascade by phosphorylation of other proteins that regulates cellular physiology and patterns of gene expression (for a review see Schlessinger, J. (2000) Cell 103: 211-225; and Blume-Jensen P. & Hunter T. (2001) Nature 411: 355-365). The intracellular signaling proteins activated in the signaling cascade can be other kinases and/or proteins involved in transcription and translation. There are several families of intracellular kinases. The Janus kinase (JAK) family of tyrosine kinases (JAK1, 2, 3, and Thyl) are activated through interaction with other proteins (see O'Shea, J. J. et al. (2002) Cell 109 (Suppl.) 121-131 and references therein). Serine/threonine kinases like the protein kinase C (PKC) family of isozymes and the mitogen activated kinases (MAP-kinase family) are also involved in the regulation of cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. The PKC-isozymes are activated by calcium, and diacylglycerol is an allosteric activator of some of the members of the PKC family (alpha beta gamma). Intracellular kinases interact with other proteins and are often translocated to other compartments upon activation (see Manning, G. et al. (2002) Science 298: 1912-1934; Martin. P. M. & Hussaini I. M. (2005) Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 9(2) 299-313 and references therein). Membrane association can be regulated by myristoylation, as in the case of PKC isozymes. Nuclear association has been described for several different classes of kinases. MAP-kinases are activated by other proteins and capable of translocating to the nucleus, where proteins involved in transcription and regulators of cell-cycle and differentiation becomes phosphorylated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring normal development and differentiation both kinase activation and deactivation is tightly regulated. Oncogenic mutations, leading to constitutively active kinases, can trans-form normal cells to cancer cells. An activating mutation can be the result of a chromosome translocation giving rise to a fusion protein, for example as in chronic myeloic leukemia where the ABL-tyrosine kinase domain is fused to the BCR protein (for a review see Östman, A. (2007) Helix Review Series Oncology 2: 2-9; and Deininger, M. et al. (2005) Blood 105: 2640-2653).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring normal hematopoesis, FLT3 is active at the myeloblast stage, but the FLT3 activity is then switched off upon normal hematopoetic differentiation to mature blood cells (Gilliand, D. G. & Griffin, J. D. (2002) Blood 100: 1532-1542; Weisel, K. C. et al. (2007) Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1106: 190-196). In acute myeloic leukemia, (AML), the FLT3 expression is high in the majority of patients (70-90%) (Carow, C. E. et al. (1996) Blood 87 (3): 1089-1096; and Rosnet, O. et al (1993) Crit. Rev. Oncogenesis 4: 595-613). Furthermore, the FLT3 kinase activity is upregulated in one third of the patients due to an internal tandem duplication in the juxtamembrane position (FLT3-ITD), resulting in a ligand independent receptor dimerization and a constitutively active kinase. FLT3-ITD is a prognostic marker, with a statistically significant reduction in survival in the patient population harboring the mutation, specially if both alleles are affected. There are also activating point mutations (FLT3-PM) of FLT3 described in AML patients. These activating mutations can be found in the activation loop of the kinase domain (AL-mutations) or in the juxtamembrane domain (JM-mutations). For a review see Carow, C. E. et al. (1996) Blood 87 (3): 1089-1096; Tickenbrock, L. et al. (2006) Expert Opin. Emerging Drugs 11(1): 153-165; Anjali S. & Advani, A. S. (2005) Current Pharmaceutical Design 11: 3449-3457; Lee B. H. et al. (2007) Cancer Cell 12: 367-380); Stam, R. W. et al. (2005) Blood 106(7): 2484-2490; and references therein. In addition FLT3-ITD or FLT3-PM has been found in subsets of patients with other lymphoid or myeloid malignancies such as MLL, T-ALL and CMML, and a high FLT3-activity has been described in B-ALL (for a review see Lee, B. H. et al. (2007) Cancer Cell 12: 367-380.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, FLT3 activity is part of the normal hematopoesis. If the proliferation of immature blast cells in the bone marrow is dysregulated, by an overstimulation of kinases like FLT3, this might result in a depletion of other hematopoetic cells. Blast cells then enter the bloodstream, instead of mature differentiated cells. The acute leukemic state results in anemia and neutropenia. Thus, blocking unfavorable kinase activity could reduce the proliferation of blast cells, and reduce the leukemic state. Several FLT3 kinase inhibitor has been tested in models of AML and in clinical indications where FLT3 is involved (Cheng, Y. & Paz, K. (2008) IDrugs 11(1): 46-56; Kiyoi, H. et al. (2007) Clin. Cancer Res. 13(15): 4575-4582; Roboz, G. J. et al. (2006) Leukemia 20: 952-957; Tse, K-F. et al. (2002) Leukemia 16: 2027-2036; Smith, B. D. et al. (2004) Blood 103: 3669-3676; Knapper, S. et al. (2006) Blood 108 (10): 3494-3503; and Furukawa, Y. et al. (2007) Leukemia 21: 1005-1014). The AML cell-line MV4-11 carries the FLT3-ITD. This cell-line is very sensitive in viability/proliferation assays to inhibitors of FLT3 activity. However, in ex-vivo patient cells there is also crosstalk between the signaling pathways, molecules activated downstream of the FLT3 receptor can also be activated by other kinases. Knapper et al 2006 showed that even though the autophosphorylation of FLT3 was down-regulated in patient cells after exposure to FLT3 inhibitors, the phosphorylation state of the down-stream effectors STAT and ERK were not diminished, possibly due to dysregulation of other signaling pathways apart from FLT3-phosphorylation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activity of FLT3 and other RTK is regulated by autophosphorylation and internalisation, the phosphorylation of the receptor is then removed by specific phosphatases that are also subject to regulation. A dysregulation of the internalization process and the dephosphorylation of the phosphatases could also have an impact on the RTK-activity and thus alter viability and proliferation of cells. As there are several orders of regulation, a kinase inhibitor needs to have a certain profile regarding its target specificity and mode of action to effectively inhibit proliferation and viability in cancer or a proliferative disorder.\n\n\n \nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates generally to certain pyrazine compounds that can act as inhibitors of the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 and related pharmaceutical compositions and methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the compounds described herein can be used, e.g., for the treatment or prevention of haematological malignancies, such as acute myeloic leukemia (AML);

The methods described above may also additionally include steps, either before or after the steps described specifically herein, to add or remove suitable protecting groups in order to ultimately allow synthesis of the compounds. In addition, various synthetic steps may be performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the desired compounds. Synthetic chemistry transformations useful in synthesizing applicable compounds are known in the art and include, for example, those described in R. Larock, \nComprehensive Organic Transformations\n, VCH Publishers (1989); L. Fieser and M. Fieser, \nFieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis\n, John Wiley and Sons (1994); and L. Paquette, ed., \nEncyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis\n, John Wiley and Sons (1995) and subsequent editions thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for carrying out the reactions described above are well known to those skilled in the art. The necessary starting materials for preparing the compounds of formula (I) are either known or may be prepared in analogy with the preparation of known compounds. The compounds of formula (I) may possess one or more chiral carbon atoms, and they may therefore be obtained in the form of optical isomers, e.g. as a pure enantiomer, or as a mixture of enantiomers (racemate) or as a mixture containing diastereomers. The separation of mixtures of optical isomers to obtain pure enantiomers is well known in the art and may, for example, be achieved by fractional crystallization of salts with optically active (chiral) acids or by chromatographic separation on chiral columns. All isomeric forms possible (pure enantiomers, diastereomers, tautomers, racemic mixtures and unequal mixtures of two enantiomers) for the compounds delineated are within the scope of the invention. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds of geometric asymmetry, it is intended to include both trans and cis (E and Z) geometric isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the formula (I) may be used as such or, where appropriate, as pharmacologically acceptable salts (acid or base addition salts) thereof. The pharmacologically acceptable addition salts mentioned above are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid and base addition salt forms that the compounds are able to form. Compounds that have basic properties can be converted to their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts by treating the base form with an appropriate acid. Exemplary acids include inorganic acids, such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen iodide, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid; and organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propanoic acid, hydroxyacetic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, glycolic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, oxalic acid, benzenesulphonic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid, pamoic acid, benzoic acid, ascorbic acid and the like. Exemplary base addition salt forms are the sodium, potassium, calcium salts, and salts with pharmaceutically acceptable amines such as, for example, ammonia, alkylamines, benzathine, and amino acids, such as, e.g. arginine and lysine. The term addition salt as used herein also comprises solvates which the compounds and salts thereof are able to form, such as, for example, hydrates, alcoholates and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor clinical use, the compounds of the invention are formulated into pharmaceutical formulations for oral, rectal, parenteral or other mode of administration. Pharmaceutical formulations are usually prepared by mixing the active substance, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with conventional pharmaceutical excipients. Examples of excipients are water, gelatin, gum arabicum, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, sodium starch glycolate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, magnesium stearate, talcum, colloidal silicon dioxide, and the like. Such formulations may also contain other pharmacologically active agents, and conventional additives, such as stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, flavouring agents, buffers, and the like. Usually, the amount of active compounds is between 0.1-95% by weight of the preparation, preferably between 0.2-20% by weight in preparations for parenteral use and more preferably between 1-50% by weight in preparations for oral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations can be further prepared by known methods such as granulation, compression, microencapsulation, spray coating, etc. The formulations may be prepared by conventional methods in the dosage form of tablets, capsules, granules, powders, syrups, suspensions, suppositories or injections. Liquid formulations may be prepared by dissolving or suspending the active substance in water or other suitable vehicles. Tablets and granules may be coated in a conventional manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose level and frequency of dosage of the specific compound will vary depending on a variety of factors including the potency of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the patient's age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the condition to be treated, and the patient undergoing therapy. The daily dosage may, for example, range from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kilo of body weight, administered singly or multiply in doses, e.g. from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg each. Normally, such a dosage is given orally but parenteral administration may also be chosen.\n\n\n \nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following definitions shall apply throughout the specification and the appended claims.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “FLT3 related disorder”, and “disorder or condition related to undesired activity of FLT3”, have been used interchangeably herein to denote any disorder or symptom wherein the FLT3 is involved in the process or presentation of the disorder or the symptom.

Several in vitro kinase assays for FLT3 inhibition have been described in the literature using cloned kinase domain and measuring phosphorylation of a substrate peptide. In addition, cell-lines expressing FLT3 have been used to measure the effect on viability and proliferation in a cellular assay.\n\n\n \nEnzyme Inhibition Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds according to the invention were evaluated for their inhibition of FLT3 by the following method:\n\n\n \nIn Vitro FLT3 Kinase Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nAn enzyme inhibition assay for the tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3 was established using a fluorescence polarization technique, Immobilized Metal Ion Affinity-Based Fluorescence Polarization (IMAP) from Molecular Devices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly: kinase activity is measured by incubating a fluorescent peptide substrate with the kinase domain. After completion of the kinase reaction a binding buffer is added. Upon phosphorylation of the substrate, the fluorescent peptide gains the ability to bind to a metal-coated nanoparticle. When the substrate is bound to the nanoparticle, the rotational is speed of the peptide is reduced, and thus the fluorescence polarization (fp) becomes high. Compounds inhibiting the kinase activity of the enzyme will result in a low degree of phosphorylated substrate and a low fp-signal.\n\n\n \nReagents\n\n\n \n \n \nIMAP Buffer kit with Progressive Binding System (Molecular Devices, #R8124): Reaction buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.2 with 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05% NaN3 and 0.01% Tween 20.

In the assay, compounds were tested in single point at 10 and 1 micromolar, diluted in reaction buffer as described above. Compounds with an inhibitory activity greater than 60% inhibition at 1 micromolar were subsequently tested in dose-respons for IC\nso \ndeterminations, using an eleven point dilution range with 1:3 dilution steps (typically from 25000 nM to 0.42 nM, more potent compounds were assayed from 500 nM to 0.0085 nM). IC\n50 \nvalues were obtained by the equation (A+4B−A)/(1+((C/x)̂D)))) where A equals min, B equals max, C equals IC\n50 \nand D equals Hill slope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds in accordance with the invention can display IC\n50 \nvalues between 1 nM and 2 μM (e.g. between 1 nM and 1 μM, between 1 nM and 500 nM, between 1 nM and 100 nM, between 1 nM and 25 nM, between 1 nM and 10 nM).\n\n\n \nCellular Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nAML cell-line MV4-11 carries the FLT3-internal tandem duplication. This cell-line has been widely used for evaluating the effect of FLT3-kinase inhibitors on viability and proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, cells are seeded at a low density into 96-well plates. Serial dilution of compounds is added and the cells are incubated for 72 hours. Total number of viable cells is measured using flow cytometry at the end of treatment, and the effect of the compounds is calculated as % inhibition compared to vehicle treated cells.\n\n\n \nCells and Culture Conditions\n\n\n \n \n \nAll cells were cultured under standard cell culture conditions, at 37° Celsius in an atmosphere of 5% CO\n2 \nin 90% humidity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAML-cell line MV4-11 was cultured in DMEM Glutamax high glucose (4500 g/l glucose) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) from Invitrogen. Cells were subcultured twice weakly, growing to a density of approx 2 million cells per ml prior to subcultivation.\n\n\n \nViability and Proliferation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nFor viability determination, 3000-5000 cells were seeded in 50 microliter culture medium into a 96-well plate. Serial dilutions 1:3 of compounds from 10 mM DMSO stock were made in serumfree culture medium supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. 50 microliter of the serial dilutions were added to the cell-suspension. The final concentration of compounds was from 5 micromolar to 0.8 nM, or from 500 nM to 0.08 nM respectively. The DMSO concentration was kept constant at 0.05%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the end of the treatment, 100 microliter viability reagent (Guava ViaCount) was added to each well and number of cells and viability was determined using flow cytometry (Guava 96-well ViaCount assay). Typically the vehicle treated (0.05% DMSO) cell-line cells had doubled three times during the experiment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n% Survival was calculated compared to the vehicle treated cells at the end of experiment.
