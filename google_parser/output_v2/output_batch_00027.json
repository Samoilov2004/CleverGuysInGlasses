Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nDisclosed herein are compounds that inhibit the activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), compositions that include the compounds, and methods of their use. Compounds disclosed herein as inhibitors of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) are useful in the treatment of diseases, disorders, or conditions that would benefit from the inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase and increases in endogenous fatty acid amides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is an enzyme that is abundantly expressed throughout the CNS (Freund et al. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83:1017-1066) as well as in peripheral tissues, such as, for example, in the pancreas, brain, kidney, skeletal muscle, placenta, and liver (Giang, D. K. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997, 94, 2238-2242; Cravatt et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004, 101, 29, 10821-10826). FAAH hydrolyzes the fatty acid amide (FAA) family of endogenous signaling lipids. General classes of fatty acid amides include the N-acylethanolamides (NAEs) and fatty acid primary amides (FAPAs). Examples of NAEs include anandamide (AEA), palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA). An example of FAPAs includes 9-Z-octadecenamide or oleamide. (McKinney M K and Cravatt B F. 2005. Annu Rev Biochem 74:411-32). Another class of fatty acid amide family of endogenous signaling lipids is N-acyl taurines that have also been shown to be elevated upon FAAH deletion or inhibition and appear to act on transient receptor potential (TRP) family of calcium channels, although the functional consequences are not yet clear (Saghatelian A, et al. Biochemistry. 2004, 43:14332-9, Saghatelian A, et al. Biochemistry, 2006, 45:9007-9015). In addition to fatty acid amides, FAAH can also hydrolyze certain fatty acid esters, such as, for example, 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) another endocannabinoid (Mechoulam et al. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50:83-90; Stella et al. Nature, 1997; 388:773-778; Suguria et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215:89-97).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of FAAH is expected to lead to an increase in the level of anandamide and other fatty acid amides. This increase in fatty acid amides leads to an increase in the noiceptive threshold. Thus, inhibitors of FAAH are useful in the treatment of pain (Cravatt, B F; Lichtman, A H Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 2003, 7, 469-475). Such inhibitors are useful in the treatment of other disorders that can be treated using fatty acid amides or modulators of cannabinoid receptors, such as, for example, anxiety, sleep disorder, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson's disease, eating disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and inflammation (Simon et al Archives of Gen. Psychiatry, 2006, 63, 824-830. Kunos, G et al. \nPharmacol Rev \n2006, 58, 389-462). In some embodiments, FAAH inhibitor compounds may be peripherally restricted and may not substantially affect neural disorders, such as, for example, depression and anxiety. Finally, agonism of cannabinoid receptors has also been shown to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis in animal models (see Steffens et al. Nature, 2005, 434, 782-786; and Steffens et al., Curr Opin. Lipid., 2006, 17, 519-526). Thus, increasing the level of endogenous cannabinergic fatty acid amides (e.g., anandamide) is expected to effectively treat or reduce the risk of developing atherosclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of FAAH also leads to elevation of palmitoylethanolamide which is thought to work, in part, through activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α) to regulate multiple pathways including, for example, pain perception in neuropathic and inflammatory conditions such as convulsions, neurotoxicity, spacticity and to reduce inflammation, for example, in atopic eczema and arthritis (LoVerme J et al. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha mediates the anti-inflammatory actions of palmitoylethanolamide. \nMol Pharmacol \n2005, 67, 15-19; LoVerme J et al The search for the palmitoylethanolamide receptor. \nLife Sci \n2005, 77: 1685-1698. Lambert D M et al. The palmitoylethanolamide family: a new class of anti-inflammatory agents? \nCurr Med Chem \n2002, 9: 663-674; Eberlein B, et al. Adjuvant treatment of atopic eczema: assessment of an emollient containing N-palmitoylethanolamine (ATOPA study). J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2008, 22:73-82. Re G, et al. Palmitoylethanolamide, endocannabinoids and related cannabimimetic compounds in protection against tissue inflammation and pain: potential use in companion animals. Vet J. 2007 173:21-30.). Thus, inhibition of FAAH is useful for the treatment of various pain and inflammatory conditions, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, skeletomuscular pain, and fibromyalgia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also thought that certain fatty acid amides, such as, for example, OEA, act through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α) to regulate diverse physiological processes, including, e.g., feeding and lipolysis. Consistent with this, human adipose tissue has been shown to bind and metabolize endocannabinoids such as anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol (see Spoto et al., Biochimie 2006, 88, 1889-1897; and Matias et al., J. Clin. Endocrin. & Met., 2006, 91, 3171-3180). Thus, inhibiting FAAH activity in vivo leads to reduced body fat, body weight, caloric intake, and liver triglyceride levels. However, unlike other anti-lipidemic agents that act through PPAR-α, e.g., fibrates, FAAH inhibitors do not cause adverse side effects such as rash, fatigue, headache, erectile dysfunction, and, more rarely, anemia, leukopenia, angioedema, and hepatitis (see, e.g., Muscari et al. Cardiology, 2002, 97: 115-121).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany fatty acid amides are produced on demand and rapidly degraded by FAAH. As a result, hydrolysis by FAAH is considered to be one of the essential steps in the regulation of fatty acid amide levels in the central nervous system as well as in peripheral tissues and fluids. The broad distribution of FAAH combined with the broad array of biological effects of fatty acid amides (both endocannabinoid and non-endocannabinoid mechanisms) suggests that inhibition of FAAH leads to altered levels of fatty acid amides in many tissues and fluids and may be useful to treat many different conditions. FAAH inhibitors increase the levels of endogenous fatty acid amides. FAAH inhibitors block the degradation of endocannabinoids and increase the tissue levels of these endogenous substances. FAAH inhibitors can be used in this respect in the prevention and treatment of pathologies in which endogenous cannabinoids and or any other substrates metabolized by the FAAH enzyme are involved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe various fatty acid ethanolamides have important and diverse physiological functions. As a result, inhibitor molecules that selectively inhibit FAAH enzymatic activity would allow a corresponding selective modulation of the cellular and extra-cellular concentrations of a FAAH substrate. FAAH inhibitors that are biologically compatible could be effective pharmaceutical compounds when formulated as therapeutic agents for any clinical indication where FAAH enzymatic inhibition is desired. In some embodiments, FAAH activity in peripheral tissues can be preferentially inhibited. In some embodiments, FAAH inhibitors that do substantially cross the blood-brain-barrier can be used to preferentially inhibit FAAH activity in peripheral tissues. In some embodiments, FAAH inhibitors that preferentially inhibit FAAH activity in peripheral tissues can minimize the effects of FAAH inhibition in the central nervous system. In some embodiments, it is preferred to inhibit FAAH activity in peripheral tissues and minimize FAAH inhibition in the central nervous system.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to certain oxazole derivatives which are useful as inhibitors of Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH).

Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds. Formula I shows the structure of the class of compounds without preferred stereochemistry. The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration. If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention is described using the following definitions unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “halogen” or “halo” includes F, Cl, Br, and I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkyl” means linear or branched structures and combinations thereof, having the indicated number of carbon atoms.

Neurological and psychological disorders that would benefit from inhibition of FAAH activity include, for example, pain, depression, anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive compulsive disorders, stress, stress urinary incontinence, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, schizophrenia, psychosis, Parkinson's disease, muscle spasticity, epilepsy, diskenesia, seizure disorders, jet lag, and insomnia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFAAH inhibitors can also be used in the treatment of a variety of metabolic syndromes, diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including but not limited to, insulin resistance syndrome, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver disease, obesity, atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis. FAAH inhibitors are useful in the treatment of a variety of painful syndromes, diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including but not limited to those characterized by non-inflammatory pain, inflammatory pain, peripheral neuropathic pain, central pain, deafferentiation pain, chronic nociceptive pain, stimulus of nociceptive receptors, phantom and transient acute pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of FAAH activity can also be used in the treatment of a variety of conditions involving inflammation. These conditions include, but are not limited to arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis, shoulder tendonitis or bursitis, gouty arthritis, and aolymyalgia rheumatica), organ-specific inflammatory diseases (such as thyroiditis, hepatitis, inflammatory bowel diseases), asthma, other autoimmune diseases (such as multiple sclerosis), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic rhinitis, and cardiovascular diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, FAAH inhibitors are useful in preventing neurodegeneration or for neuroprotection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, it has been shown that when FAAH activity is reduced or absent, one of its substrates, anandamide, acts as a substrate for COX-2, which converts anandamide to prostamides (Weber et al J Lipid. Res. 2004; 45:757). Concentrations of certain prostamides may be elevated in the presence of a FAAH inhibitor. Certain prostamides are associated with reduced intraocular pressure and ocular hypotensivity. Thus, in one embodiment, FAAH inhibitors may be useful for treating glaucoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, FAAH inhibitors can be used to treat or reduce the risk of EMDs, which include, but are not limited to, obesity, appetite disorders, overweight, cellulite, Type I and Type II diabetes, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, steatohepatitis, liver steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, Syndrome X, insulin resistance, diabetic dyslipidemia, anorexia, bulimia, anorexia nervosa, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, inflammatory disorders or conditions, Alzheimer's disease, Crohn's disease, vascular inflammation, inflammatory bowel disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, thrombosis, or cachexia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, FAAH inhibitors can be used to treat or reduce the risk of insulin resistance syndrome and diabetes, i.e., both primary essential diabetes such as Type I Diabetes or Type II Diabetes and secondary nonessential diabetes. Administering a composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of an in vivo FAAH inhibitor reduces the severity of a symptom of diabetes or the risk of developing a symptom of diabetes, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, liver steatosis, nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, foot ulceration, or cataracts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, FAAH inhibitors can be used to treat food abuse behaviors, especially those liable to cause excess weight, e.g., bulimia, appetite for sugars or fats, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, FAAH inhibitors can be used to treat a subject suffering from an EMD and also suffers from a depressive disorder or from an anxiety disorder. Preferably, the subject is diagnosed as suffering from the depressive or psychiatric disorder prior to administration of the FAAH inhibitor composition. Thus, a dose of a FAAH inhibitor that is therapeutically effective for both the EMD and the depressive or anxiety disorder is administered to the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the subject to be treated is human. However, the methods can also be used to treat non-human mammals. Animal models of EMDs such as those described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,946,491 are particularly useful.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFAAH inhibitor compositions can also be used to decrease body-weight in individuals wishing to decrease their body weight for cosmetic, but not necessarily medical considerations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA FAAH inhibitor composition can be administered in combination with a drug for lowering circulating cholesterol levels (e.g., statins, niacin, fibric acid derivatives, or bile acid binding resins). FAAH inhibitor compositions can also be used in combination with a weight loss drug, e.g., orlistat or an appetite suppressant such as diethylpropion, mazindole, orlistat, phendimetrazine, phentermine, or sibutramine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “treating” encompasses not only treating a patient to relieve the patient of the signs and symptoms of the disease or condition but also prophylactically treating an asymptomatic patient to prevent the onset of the disease or condition or preventing, slowing or reversing the progression of the disease or condition.

Such acids include acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and the like. Particularly preferred are citric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, maleic, phosphoric, sulfuric, and tartaric acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood that in the discussion of methods of treatment which follows, references to the compounds of Formula I are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe magnitude of prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of Formula I will, of course, vary with the nature and the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound of Formula I and its route of administration. It will also vary according to a variety of factors including the age, weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and response of the individual patient. In general, the daily dose from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kg body weight of a mammal, preferably 0.01 mg to about 10 mg per kg. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans may contain from about 0.5 mg to about 5 g of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of carrier material which may vary from about 5 to about 95 percent of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain from about 1 mg to about 2 g of an active ingredient, typically 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 500 mg, 600 mg, 800 mg, or 1000 mg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the treatment of FAAH mediated diseases the compound of Formula I may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. In addition to the treatment of warm-blooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, cats, etc., the compound of the invention is effective in the treatment of humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, solutions, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavouring agents, colouring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredients is mixed with water-miscible solvents such as propylene glycol, PEGs and ethanol, or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more colouring agents, one or more flavouring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSyrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavouring and colouring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. Cosolvents such as ethanol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols may also be used. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula I may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ambient temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor topical use, creams, ointments, gels, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing a compound of Formula I are employed. (For purposes of this application, topical application shall include mouth washes and gargles.) Topical formulations may generally be comprised of a pharmaceutical carrier, cosolvent, emulsifier, penetration enhancer, preservative system, and emollient.\n\n\n \nAssays\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following assays illustrate the utility of the invention:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention underwent pharmacological evaluations to determine their inhibitory effect on the enzyme FAAH (Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo assist in assay development stable cell lines for human, murine and rat full length FAAH were developed. Human FAAH cDNA (Accession No: NM\n—\n001441.1) was purchased from Origene (Rockville, Md.). The full length FAAH was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pcDEF.neo, using XbaI and EcoRI restriction sites and used for stable cell line generation.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruct\n\n\nPrimer\n\n\nSequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull length\n\n\n1\n\n\nCAAGGTACCGCCACCATGGTGCTGAGCGAA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrodent FAAH\n\n\n \n\n\nGTGTGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull length\n\n\n2\n\n\nCCGGAATTCTCAAGATGGCCGCTTTTCAGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmurine FAAH\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFull length\n\n\n3\n\n\nCCGGAATTCTCACGATGGCTGCTTTTGAGG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat FAAH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMurine (accession number NM\n—\n010173) and Rat FAAH (accession number NM\n—\n024132) was amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from brain cDNA (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) using primers 1 and 2 or primers 1 and 3 respectively (see Table). The resulting PCR product was ligated into pCR4 TOPO and DNA sequence confirmed. The full length murine FAAH was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pcDEFneo using either EcoRI (murine) or KpnI and EcoRI (rat) restriction sites. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) were transfected following manufacturers protocol (AMAXA). Forty eight hours post transfection, cells were trypsinized and transferred to 96 well plates in Iscove's DMEM media supplemented with 2 mM Glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mg/ml geneticin and HT Supplement (0.1 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 0.016 mM thymidine) in order to isolate single clones. Following selection in geneticin, individual clones were selected and FAAH activity was assessed using a whole cell fluorescent anandamide assay, modified from Ramarao et al (2005). Following removal of tissue culture media cells were dislodged following addition of Cellstripper (Mediatech, Inc. Manassas, Va.) and transferred to 96 well black clear bottom assay plate, centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 3 mins and media removed and replaced with assay buffer (50 mM Iris pH8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA). The reaction was initiated by addition of fluorescent substrate, AMC Arachidonoyl Amide (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Mich.) to 1 μM and reaction allowed to proceed for 2 hours at room temperature. Release of fluorescence was monitored in a CytoFluor Multiplate Reader. Cells expressing the highest amount of FAAH activity were selected for study with FAAH inhibitors.\n\n\n \nPreparation of Lysate and Microsomes\n\n\n \n \n \nCHO cells expressing FAAH were used to prepare either crude cell lysate or microsome fractions. To harvest cells, tissue culture media was decanted, the monolayer washed three times with Ca\n++\nMg\n++\n free PBS and cells recovered after 15 mM in enzyme free dissociation media (Millipore Corp, Billerica, Mass.). Cells were collected by centrifuging at 2000 rpm for 15 min. and the cell pellet re-suspended with 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM EDTA and the protease inhibitors aprotinin (1 mg/ml) and leupeptin (100 μM). The suspension was sonicated at 4° C. and the cell lysate recovered after centrifuging at 12,000×g (14,600 rpm, SS34 rotor) for 20 min at 4° C. to form a crude pellet of cell debris, nuclei, peroxisomes, lysosomes, and mitochondria; the supernatant or cell lysate was used for FAAH enzyme assay. In some cases, microsomes fractions enriched in FAAH were prepared by centrifuging the cell lysate further at 27,000 rpm (100,000×g) in SW28 rotor for 50 minutes at 4° C. The pellet containing FAAH-enriched microsomes was re-suspend in 50 mM HEPES, (pH 7.4) 1 mM EDTA, and any remaining DNA sheared by passage of material through a 23 gauge needle and aliquots of enzyme were store at −80° C. prior to use.\n\n\n \nFAAH Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nSeveral assays have been used to demonstrate the inhibitory activity. Enzyme activity was demonstrated in a radioenzymatic test based on measuring the product of hydrolysis (ethanolamine [\n3\nH]) of anandamide [ethanolamine 1-.sup.3H] (American Radiolabeled Chemicals; 1 mCi/ml) with FAAH (Life Sciences (1995), 56, 1999-2005 and Journal of Pharmacology and Experimented Therapeutics (1997), 283, 729-734), Analytical. Biochemistry (2003), 318, 270-5. In addition, routine assays were performed monitoring hydrolysis of arachidonyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin amide (AAMCA) by following increase in fluorescence upon release of 7-amino 4-methyl coumarin (λ\nEX\n=355 nm, (λ\nEM\n=460 nm). Analytical. Biochemistry (2005). 343, 143-51\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssays are performed on either cell lysate or microsome fractions prepared as described or in whole cell format employing either the fluorescent substrate AAMCA (Cayman chemical, Ann Arbor, Mich.,) or \n3\nH-anandmaide ([ETHANOLAMINE-1-3H]American Radiolabeled Chemicals; 1 mCi/ml). The cell lysate or microsome assay is performed in Costar black wall, clear bottom plates by adding FAAH_CF\n10 \n(whole cell, cell lysate or microsome) in assay buffer (50 mM Phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 200 mM KCl, 0.2% glycerol, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA) to each well, followed by either DMSO or compound and allowed to incubate at 22-25° C. for fifteen minutes. AAMCA substrate was used to achieve a final concentration of 1 μM and reaction allowed to proceed at room temperature for 1-3 hours. Fluorescent release as a measure of FAAH activity was monitored by reading the plate in a CytoFluor Multiplate Reader (Ex: 360/40 nM; Em: 460/40 nM). Whole cell assay is conducted with cells harvested after rinsing tissue culture flasks three times with Ca\n++\nMg\n++\n free PBS, incubating for 10 min in Enzyme free dissociation media and centrifuging for 5 minutes at 1,000 rpm in table top centrifuge. Cells are resuspended in assay buffer at desired cell number in (4×10\n4 \ncells/assay in 96-well format; 1×10\n4 \ncells/assay in 384-well format) and assayed as described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, assays are performed using anandamide [ethanolamine 1-.sup.3H] (specific activity of 10 Ci/mmol) diluted with cold anandamide to achieve a final assay concentration of 1 μM anandamide (˜50,000 cpm). Enzyme (CHO cell lysate, brain or liver homogenate) is incubated in assay buffer (50 mM Phosphate, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 200 mM KCl, 0.2% glycerol, 0.1% fatty acid free BSA) with inhibitor at 25° C. for 30 minutes. The reaction was terminated by addition of 2 volumes of chloroform:methanol (1:1) and mixed by vortexing. Following a centrifugation step, 2000 rpm for 10 min. at room temperature, the aqueous phase containing the released \n3\nH-ethanolamide was recovered and quantitated by liquid scintillation as a reflection of FAAH enzyme activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRamarao M.

A method for treating obesity, diabetes, fatty liver, bulimia, depression, or anxiety, comprising as an active ingredient a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to claim \n1\n. Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a novel diarylmethylamide derivative. The compound acts as a melanin-concentrating hormone receptor antagonist, and is useful as an agent for the prevention, treatment, or remedy of various circulatory diseases, neurological diseases, metabolic diseases, reproductive system diseases, respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, and the like.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nMelanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is cyclic peptide hormone/neuropeptide that was first isolated from the hypophysis of salmon by Kawauchi et al., in 1983 [see \nNature, Vol. \n305, 321 (1983)], and is known to functionally antagonize melanocyte-stimulating hormone in the fishes to cause condensation of melanin granules in the melanophore, thus being involved in the body color change [see \nInternational Review of Cytology\n, Vol. 126, 1 (1991); \nTrends in Endocrinology and Metabolism\n, Vol. 5, 120 (1994)]. Further, in the mammals, although MCH-containing neuron cell bodies are localized in the lateral hypothalamic area and the zona incerta, the nerve fibers thereof project to an extremely large area in the brain [see \nThe Journal of Comparative Neurology\n, Vol. 319, 218 (1992)], and MCH is believed to be responsible for various central biological functions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lateral hypothalamic area has been known as the feeding center from long ago, and further, in recent years, much molecular biological/pharmacological knowledge suggesting involvement of MCH in the energy homeostasis control has been accumulated. Specifically, it has been reported that expression of mRNA, an MCH precursor, is accelerated in the brain of genetic obesity model animals, i.e., ob/ob mice, db/db mice, KKAy mice, Zucker fatty rats, and fasted mice [see \nNature\n, Vol. 380, 243 (1996); Diabetes, Vol. 47, 294 (1998); \nBiochemical and Biophysical Research Communications\n, Vol. 268, 88 (2000); \nMolecular Brain Research\n, Vol. 92, 43 (2001)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result of acute intraventricular administration of MCH to rats, an increase in food intake is observed [\nNature\n, Vol. 380, 243 (1996)], and chronic administration leads to obesity accompanied by bulimia [see \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\n, Vol. 99, 3240 (2002)]. Further, in mice lacking MCH precursor gene, as compared with wild mice, reduced food consumption and increased oxygen consumption per body weight are seen, and also low body weight due to reduction in body fat is observed [see \nNature\n, Vol. 396, 670 (1998)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMeanwhile, transgenic mice that overexpress MCH precursor develop obesity, which is accompanied by bulimia, and insulin resistance [see \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation\n, Vol. 107, 379 (2001)]. This accordingly suggests that MCH is an important factor in the development of obesity, and is also involved in metabolic disorders and respiratory diseases for which obesity is a risk factor. In addition, MCH is known to be involved in, for example, anxiogenesis, epilepsy, memory/learning, diuresis, sodium/potassium excretion, oxytocin secretion, and reproduction/reproductive function [see \nPeptides\n, Vol. 17, 171 (1996); \nPeptides\n, Vol. 18, 1095 (1997); \nPeptides\n, Vol. 15, 757 (1994); \nJournal of Neuroendocrinology\n, Vol. 8, 57 (1996) \nCritical Reviews in Neurobiology\n, Vol. 8, 221 (1994)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMCH causes various pharmacological effects via MCH receptors existing mainly in the central nervous system. As MCH receptors, at least two types are known: type 1 receptor (MCH-1R or SLC-1) and type 2 receptor (MCH-2R or SLT) [see \nNature\n, Vol. 400, 261 (1999); \nNature\n, Vol. 400, 265 (1999); \nBiochemical and Biophysical Research Communications\n, Vol. 261, 622 (1999); \nNature Cell Biology\n, Vol. 1, 267 (1999); \nFEBS Letters\n, Vol. 457, 522 (1999); \nBiochemical and Biophysical Research Communications\n, Vol. 283, 1013 (2001); \nThe Journal of Biological Chemistry\n, Vol. 276, 20125 (2001); \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\n, Vol. 98, 7564 (2001); \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\n, Vol. 98, 7576 (2001); \nThe Journal of Biological Chemistry\n, Vol. 276, 34664 (2001); \nMolecular Pharmacology\n, Vol. 60, 632 (2001)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, pharmacological effects observed in the rodents are caused mainly via MCH-1R [see \nGenomics\n, Vol. 79, 785 (2002)]. From the fact that chronic administration of MCH to mice lacking MCH-1R gene does not induce bulimia or obesity, the energy metabolism control by MCH is known to be caused via MCH-1R. Further, it is known that deficiency of MCH-1R gene increases the amount of activity of a mouse [see \nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\n, Vol. 99, 3240 (2002)], and also, involvement in central diseases accompanied by behavior disorder, such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, depression, and the like, is strongly suggested [see \nMolecular Medicine Today\n, Vol. 6, 43 (2000); \nTrends in Neuroscience\n, Vol. 24, 527 (2001)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the presence of an autoantibody against MCH-1R has been reported in the blood serum of vitiligo vulgaris patients [see \nThe Journal of Clinical Investigation\n, Vol. 109, 923 (2002)]. MCH-1R expression in certain kinds of cancer cells has also been reported, and, in light of the MCH and MCH-1R expression sites in vivo, involvement of MCH in cancer, sleep/waking, drug dependence, and digestive diseases has also been suggested [see \nBiochemical and Biophysical Research Communications\n, Vol. 289, 44 (2001); Neuroendocrinology, Vol. 61, 348 (1995); \nEndocrinology\n, Vol. 137, 561 (1996); \nThe Journal of Comparative Neurology\n, Vol. 435, 26 (2001)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe function of MCH is expressed by MCH binding to an MCH receptor. Accordingly, inhibition of binding of MCH to its receptor will inhibit the expression of MCH activity. Therefore, substances that antagonize binding of MCH to its receptor are expected to be useful as preventive or remedy for various MCH-related diseases, including metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, hormone secretion disorder, hyperlipemia, gout, fatty liver, and like; circulatory diseases such as angina pectoris, acute/congestive cardiac insufficiency, myocardial infarction, coronary arteriosclerosis, hypertension, nephropathy, electrolyte abnormality, and like; central and peripheral nervous system diseases such as bulimia, affective disorder, depression, anxiety, epilepsy, delirium, dementia, schizophrenia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dysmnesia, somnipathy, cognitive impairment, dyskinesia, dysesthesia, dysosmia, morphine resistance, drug dependence, alcohol dependence, and like; reproductive system diseases such as infertility, premature delivery, sexual dysfunction, and like; and other conditions including digestive diseases, respiratory diseases, cancer, chromatosis, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs compounds having MCH receptor antagonism, for example, WO 03/004027 (Patent Document 1) and US 2006/079683 (Patent Document 2) disclose a number of N-benzyl-4-phenylpiperidine derivatives.

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application is a U.S. National Phase application under 35 U.S.C. §371 of PCT Application No. PCT/JP2006/317024, filed Aug. 23, 2006, which published as WO 2007/024004 A1 on Jan. 3, 2007, and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §365(b) from Japanese patent application No. JP2005-242397, filed Aug. 24, 2005.\n\n\nTechnical Field\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a novel phenylpyridone derivative. The compound acts as a melanin concentrating hormone receptor antagonist, and is useful as a preventive, treating or remedial agent for various circular system diseases, nervous system diseases, metabolic diseases, genital diseases, respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, etc.\n\n\nBackground Art\n\n\nMelanin concentrating hormone (hereafter referred to as “MCH”) is a cyclic peptide hormone/neuro-peptide, which was for the first time isolated by Kawauchi, et al., in 1983 from sermon hypophysis. [Nature, Vol. 305, 321 (1983)]. The hormone is known to functionally antagonize for melanin cell stimulating hormone in fishes, to cause concentration of melanin granules in melanophore and participate in body color change [International Review of Cytology, Vol. 126, 1 (1991); Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism, Vol. 5, 120 (1994)]. Also in mammals, MCH-containing neuron cells are localized in the hypothalamus lateral field and uncertain zone, but their nerve fibers are projecting over a very wide scope in the brain [see The Journal of Comparative Neurology, Vol. 319, 218 (1992)], and MCH is considered to preside over various central functions in living bodies.\n\n\nHypothalamus lateral field is known of old as feeding center, and furthermore, recently molecular biological and pharmacological knowledges suggesting participation of MCH in controlling energetic homeostasis are being much accumulated. That is, it has been reported that expression of mRNA, which is an MCH precursor, is accelerated in the brains of ob/ob mice, db/db mice, A\ny\n/a mice, Zucker fatty rats which are model animals of hereditary obesity, and in the brains of fasting mice [see Nature, Vol. 380, 243 (1996); Diabetes, Vol. 47, 294 (1998); Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 268, 88 (2000); Molecular Brain Research, Vol. 92, 43 (2001)].\n\n\nAcute ventricular administration of MCH to rats was observed to induce accelerated feeding activity [Nature, Vol. 380, 243 (1996)] and chronic administration invites obesity accompanied by polyphagy [see Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 99, 3240 (2002)]. Moreover, MCH precursor gene-deficient mice show reduced food ingestion or rise in oxygen consumption per body weight compared to wild type mice. Their low body weight due to decrease in body fat was observed [see Nature, Vol. 396, 670 (1998)].\n\n\nOn the contrary, transgenic mice which express excessive MCH precursor develop obesity accompanied by polyphagy and insulin resistance [see The Journal of Clinical Investigation, Vol. 107, 379 (2001)]. Consequently, it is suggested that MCH is an important factor for developing obesity and participates in diseases induced by metabolic disorders or respiratory diseases for which obesity is one risk factor. Besides, MCH is known to participate also in anxiety-causing action, epilepsy, memory, learning, diuretic action, sodium/potassium excretory action, oxytocin secreting action, reproduction and reproductive function [see Peptides, Vol. 17, 171 (1996); Peptides, Vol. 18, 1095 (1997); Peptides, Vol. 15, 757 (1994); Journal of Neuroendocrinology, Vol. 8, 57 (1996); Critical Reviews in Neurobiology, Vol. 8, 221 (1994)].\n\n\nMCH causes versatile pharmacological actions through MCH receptors which are present mainly in the central nervous system. As receptors of MCH, at least two types of type 1 receptors (MCH-1R or SLC-1) and type 2 receptors (MCH-2R or SLT) are known [see Nature, Vol. 400, 261 (1999); Nature, Vol. 400, 265 (1999); Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 261, 622 (1999); Nature Cell Biology, Vol. 1, 267 (1999); FEBS Letters, Vol. 457, 522 (1999); Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 283, 1013 (2001); The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 276, 20125 (2001); Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 98, 7564 (2001); Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 98, 7576 (2001); The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 276, 34664 (2001); Molecular Pharmacology, Vol. 60, 632 (2001)].\n\n\nOf those, the pharmacological action observed on rodents is induced mainly via MCH-1R [see Genomics, Vol. 79, 785 (2002)]. Because MCH-1R gene-deficient mice chronically administered with MCH do not develop polyphagy or obesity, it is known that controlling of energy metabolism by MCH is induced via MCH-1R. Furthermore, the deficiency of MCH-1R is known to promote the activity amount of mice [see Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 99, 3240 (2002)], and its participation in central diseases accompanied by behavioral disorders, for example, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, depression and the like also is strongly suggested [see Molecular Medicine Today, Vol. 6, 43 (2000); Trends in Neuroscience, Vol. 24, 527 (2001)].\n\n\nIt is also reported that an autoantibody to MCH-1R is present in serum of vitiligo vulgaris patients [see The Journal of Clinical Investigation, Vol. 109, 923 (2002)]. Furthermore, expression of MCH-1R in certain species of cancer cells was reported, and in vivo expression sites of MCH and MCH-1R also suggest MCH's participation in cancer, sleep, vigil, drug dependence and digestive disorders [see Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 289, 44 (2001); Neuroendocrinology, Vol. 61, 348 (1995); Endocrinology, Vol. 137, 561 (1996); The Journal of Comparative Neurology, Vol. 435, 26 (2001)].\n\n\nFunctions of MCH are expressed upon it binding to MCH receptors. Therefore, when its binding to MCH receptor is inhibited, then expression of MCH action can be inhibited. In consequence, substances which are antagonists for binding of MCH with its receptor are useful as preventive, treating or remedial agents for those various diseases in which MCH participates, for example, metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, hormone disorder, hyperlipidemia, gout, fatty liver; cardiovascular disorders such as stenocardia, acute or congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary atherosclerosis, hypertension, renal diseases, electrolyte abnormality; central and peripheral nervous system disorders such as bulimia, emotional disturbance, depression, anxiety, epilepsy, delirium, dementia, schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, memory impairment, sleep disorders, cognitive failure, dyskinesia, paresthesias, smell disorders, morphine tolerance, drug dependence, alcoholism; reproductive disorders such as infertility, preterm labor and sexual dysfunction; and other digestive disorders, respiratory disorders, cancer or pigmentation et al.\n\n\nAs compounds having an MCH receptor antagonistic effect, for example, various compounds are disclosed in WO01/21577, WO01/82925, WO02/06245, WO02/02744. However, they do not have a pyridone ring.\n\n\nWO03/68230 (Patent Reference 1) discloses a wide variety of pyridone derivatives having a P38MAP kinase activity. However, in the compound that the present invention discloses, the pyridone ring directly bonds to the benzene ring, the phenyl group adjacent to the pyridone is unsubstituted, and the group with which the pyridone ring may be substituted is a halogen atom alone; but the compounds that satisfy these conditions are not given in the reference, and further, the reference does not describe an MCH receptor antagonistic effect.\n\n\nPatent Reference 1: WO03/68230\n\n\nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present inventors have assiduously studied compounds having an MCH receptor antagonistic effect, and as a result, have found that a pyridone derivative, in which a phenyl group directly bonds to the N atom of the pyridone ring and the phenyl group has a specific amino group at the para-position via a linker, has an MCH receptor antagonistic effect and is effective for prevention, treatment or remedy of various MCH receptor-associated diseases, and have completed the present invention.\n\n\nSpecifically, the invention provides:\n\n\n(1) a phenylpyridone derivative of a formula (I) or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n[wherein:\n\n\n\nR\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare the same or different, each representing a hydrogen atom, or a lower alkyl group optionally having substituent(s), and R\n1\n, taken together with L, Z\n2 \nand the nitrogen atom adjacent to R\n1\n, may form an aliphatic nitrogen-containing hetero ring optionally having substituent(s), and R\n1 \nand R\n2\n, taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they bond, may form an aliphatic nitrogen-containing hetero ring optionally having substituent(s);\n\n\nX represents a methine group optionally substituted with a halogen, or a nitrogen atom;\n\n\nY represents —CH\n2\n—O—, —CH═CH— or —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—;\n\n\nZ\n1 \nrepresents a single bond, a C\n1-4 \nalkylene group optionally having substituent(s), a C\n1-4 \nalkylene-O— optionally having substituent(s), a C\n1-3 \nalkylene-O—C\n1-3 \nalkylene group optionally having substituent(s), a C\n2-4 \nalkenylene group optionally having substituent(s), or —NR—, R represents a hydrogen atom, or a lower alkyl group optionally having substituent(s);\n\n\nZ\n2 \nrepresents a single bond or a C\n1-4 \nalkylene group optionally having substituent(s);\n\n\nL represents a methylene group optionally having substituent(s), or a C\n3-8 \ncycloalkylene group optionally having substituent(s), or L, taken together with Z\n2\n, R\n1 \nand the nitrogen atom adjacent to R\n1\n, may form an aliphatic nitrogen-containing hetero ring optionally having substituent(s);\n\n\nprovided that, when Z\n1 \nand Z\n2 \nare single bonds at the same time, then L is not a methylene group;\n\n\nAr represents an aromatic carbocyclic group optionally having substituent(s), or an aromatic heterocyclic group optionally having substituent(s)].\n\n\nThe invention further provides:\n\n\n(2) a melanin concentrating hormone receptor antagonist comprising a compound of (1) or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof as the active ingredient;\n\n\n(3) a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable additive and a compound of (1) or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof,\n\n\n(4) a preventive, treating or remedial agent comprising a compound of (1) or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof as the active ingredient, for metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, hormone disorder, hyperlipidemia, gout, fatty liver, hepatitis, cirrhosis;
