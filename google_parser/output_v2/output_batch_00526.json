The contents of which are each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to compositions and methods for modulating blood-brain barrier transport of compounds. In addition, the present invention provides screening assays for identifying compounds that are useful for modulating transport across the blood-brain barrier.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn the early 1980's, melanotransferrin (MTf) was identified as an oncofetal antigen that was either not expressed, or only slightly expressed in normal tissues, but was found in much larger amounts in neoplastic cells (especially malignant melanoma cells) and fetal tissues (Woodbury, et al., P.N.A.S. USA, 77:2183-2187 (1980)). More recently, there have been additional reports of human MTf being identified in normal tissues, including sweat gland ducts, liver endothelial cells and the endothelium and reactive microglia of the brain (Jefferies, et al., Brain Res., 712:122-126 (1996); and Rothenberger, et al., Brain Res., 712:117-121 (1996)). Interestingly, normal serum contains very low levels of soluble circulating MTf, but increased soluble serum MTf has been found in patients with advanced Alzheimer's Disease (Kennard, et al., Nat. Med., 2:1230-1235 (1996); U.S. Pat. No. 5,981,194)\n\n\nThe biochemical role and metabolism of MTf has proven difficult to elucidate. Based on appearances, MTf is deceptively similar to transferrin (TO and lactotransfernin (lactoferrin or Lf). In humans, these proteins share a 37-39% amino acid sequence homology. In particular, each of these proteins reversibly binds iron, and their N-terminal iron binding domains are quite similar (Baker, et al., \nTIBS, \n12:350-353 (1987)).\n\n\nHowever, functional parallels between these proteins have not been confirmed. For one thing, unlike Tf and Lf, MTf exists in both a membrane bound form and a serum soluble form. Further, in contrast to Tf and Lf, no cellular receptor for MTf has been identified. Serum soluble Tf is known to be taken into cells in an energy-dependent process mediated by the transferrin receptor (Tf-R) (Cook, et al., \nAnnu. Rev. Med., \n44:63-74 (1993)). Lf internalization is also likely to be mediated by a receptor mediated process (Fillebeen, et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n274(11):7011-7017 (1999)). Two known receptors for Lf are LRP1 and RAGE, although others may exist (Meilinger, et al., \nFEBS Letters, \n360:70-74 (1995); Schmidt, \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n269(13):9882-9888 (1994)).\n\n\nAlthough it has been postulated that MTf is an alternate ligand for Tf-R (see, U.S. Pat. No. 5,981,194), no published data confirms this finding. Further, although various studies have confirmed iron transport into cells by membrane bound MTf, it occurs only in cells where membrane bound MTf is overexpressed well beyond physiological levels (Richardson, \nEur. J. Biochem., \n267:1290-1298 (2000)).\n\n\nTherapeutic and diagnostic agents conjugated to soluble MTf are the basis of recently filed U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 60/226,242 and 60/226,254, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.\n\n\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) performs a neuroprotective function by tightly controlling access to the brain; consequently it also impedes access of pharmacological agents to cerebral tissues, necessitating the use of vectors for their transit. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability is frequently a rate-limiting factor for the penetration of drugs or peptides into the central nervous system (CNS) (see Pardridge, W. M. \nJ. Neurovirol. \n5: 556-569 (1999); Bickel, U., Yoshikawa, T. & Pardridge, W. M. \nAdv. Drug Deliv. Rev. \n46: 247-279 (2001)). The brain is shielded against potentially toxic substances by the BBB, which is formed by brain capillary endothelial cells that are closely sealed by tight junctions. In addition, brain capillaries possess few fenestrae and few endocytic vesicles, compared to the capillaries of other organs (see Pardridge, W. M. \nJ. Neurovirol. \n5: 556-569 (1999)). There is little transit across the BBB of large, hydrophilic molecules aside from some specific proteins such as transferrin, lactoferrin and low-density lipoproteins, which are taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis (see Pardridge, W. M. J. Neurovirol. 5: 556-569 (1999); Tsuji, A. & Tamai, I. \nAdv. Drug Deliv. Rev. \n36: 277-290 (1999); Kusuhara, H. & Sugiyama, Y. \nDrug Discov. Today \n6:150-156 (2001); Dehouck, B. et al. \nJ. Cell. Biol. \n138: 877-889 (1997); and Fillebeen, C. et al. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n274: 7011-7017 (1999).\n\n\nIn order to understand and improve the delivery of therapeutic agents into cells, it is highly desirable to understand the receptors and metabolic basis of MTf activity. It is an object of this invention to identify the receptor for MTf, and to provide methods and compounds for improving the delivery of therapeutic and diagnostic agents into cells, in particular, therapeutic and diagnostic agents conjugated to MTf, and particularly their delivery across the blood-brain barrier.\n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides compositions and methods for modulating trancystosis, endocytosis, and blood-brain barrier transport of compounds.

Permeability coefficient (Pe) of sucrose with BBCECs. The permeability coefficient (Pe) for sucrose was calculated as previously described (Dehouck, et al., \nJ. Neurochem., \n58:1790-1797 (1992)) using filters coated or non-coated with BBCE cells co-cultured cultured with astrocytes. Briefly, coated or non-coated filters with BBCE cells were transferred to 6-well plates containing 2 ml of Ringer-Hepes per well (basolateral compartment) for 2 hrs at 37° C. In each apical chamber, the culture medium was replaced by 1 ml Ringer-Hepes containing labeled [\n14\nC]-sucrose. At different times, inserts were placed into another well. At the end of the experiments, amounts of the radiotracers in the basolateral compartment were measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The results were plotted as the sucrose clearance (μl) as a function of time (min). The permeability of sucrose with non-coated filters with BBCE cells (PSf) and with coated filters with BBCE cells (PSt) were obtained. The results were plotted as the clearance of [\n14\nC]-sucrose (μl) as a function of time (min). PS=permeability×surface area of a filter of the coculture; PSt=permeability of the filter and endothelial monolayer; PSf=permeability of a filter coated with collagen and astrocytes plated on the bottom side of the filter. The permeability coefficient (Pe) of the endothelial monolayer was calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nClearance\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nμ\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nC\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nC\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nC\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nAbluminal\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ntracer\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nconcentration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolume\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nof\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nabluminal\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchamber\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nC\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nLuminal\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ntracer\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nconcentration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n/\n\n\nPe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n/\n\n\nPSt\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n/\n\n\nPSf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\nfilter\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\narea\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\ncm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFIG. 2\n. Effect of p97 (1 μm) on sucrose permeability with BBCECs that were preincubated for 2 hrs at 37° C. The effect of p97 at 1 μM on sucrose permeability of the in vitro BBB model was tested. The permeability coefficient (Pe) for sucrose was calculated as previously described (Dehouck, et al., J. Neurochem., 58:1790-179 (1992)) using filters coated or non-coated with BBCE cells. Briefly, coated or non-coated filters with BBCE cells were transferred to 6-well plates containing 2 ml of Ringer/Hepes per well (basolateral compartment) for 2 hrs at 37° C. In each apical (i.e., luminal) chamber, the culture medium was replaced by 1 ml Ringer/Hepes containing labeled [\n14\nC]-sucrose. At different times, inserts were placed into another well. At the end of the experiments, amounts of the radiotracers in the basolateral (i.e., abluminal) compartment were measured in a liquid scintillation counter.

Binding p97 was performed with BBCECs that were pre-incubated 2 hrs in Ringer-Hepes to avoid any interference from the astrocytes. For the binding experiments, cells were incubated for 2 h at 4° C. in Ringer/Hepes in the presence of [\n125\nI]-p97 (25 nM) and 7.5 micromolar concentrations of cold-p97, transferrin or lactoferrin, respectively. At the end of the incubation, the filters were gently washed at 4° C. three times with 4 ml of cold-PBS. Then the associated radioactivity of endothelial cells was determined by removing the membrane of the culture insert and counting it in a gamma counter.\n\n\n \nFIG. 4\n. Binding of p97 on rat brain endothelial cells. Binding p97 was performed with RBE4 that were pre-incubated 2 hrs in Ringer-Hepes. For the binding experiments, cells in 24-well microplates were incubated for 2 h at 4° C. in Ringer/Hepes in the presence of [\n125\nI]-p97 (25 nM) and 10 micromolar concentrations of cold-p97, transferrin or lactoferin, respectively. At the end of the incubation, the cells were gently washed at 4° C. three times with 4 ml of cold-PBS. RBE4 cells were then lysed with Triton X-100 and the associated radioactivity of with cell lysates was determined.\n\n\n \nFIG. 5\n. Accumulation of p97 in human brain capillaries. Accumulation of [\n125\nI]-p97 was measured at 37° C. for 1 h in isolated human brain capillaries (100 μg/assay). The incubation medium contained [\n125\nI]-p97 and a final concentration of 100 nM p97 in Ringer/Hepes solution. The accumulation of [\n125\nI]-p97 was performed in the presence or absence of 5 μm cold-p97, holo-transferrin or lactoferrin. After incubation, the accumulation was stopped by addition of 1 ml-cold stop solution (150 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA and 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.5). The suspension was filtered under vacuum through a 0.45 μM pore size Millipore filter. The filter was rinsed with 8 ml of stop solution, and the radioactivity was counted. Nonspecific binding of the radioactivity to the capillaries was determined by the addition of the ice-cold stop solution to the capillaries before adding the incubation medium. This value was subtracted from accumulation values obtained following an 1 h incubation. The results were expressed as ng of [\n125\nI]-p97 accumulated per μg of brain capillaries.\n\n\n \nFIG. 6\n is a repeat experiment, performed identically to the experiment of \nFIG. 5\n, except this time with the additional competition assay for β-amyloid peptide. Evidently, the β-amyloid peptide 1-40 competes with p97 for receptor binding, along with lactoferrin, but not with transferrin.\n\n\n \nFIG. 7\n illustrates the results of experiments where the ligands p97, Lf and Tf were heated or not heated prior to the binding study. In all cases, binding experiments were conducted in the transwell apparatus as described previously, with the exception that binding was conducted at either 4° C. or at 37° C. For the 37° C. trial, a separate experiment was conducted where the ligand was boiled for 30 mins then rapidly cooled prior to administration on the transwell plates.\n\n\n \nFIG. 8\n demonstrates that p97 transcytosis was significantly higher at 37° C. than at 4° C. This result demonstrates that p97 is actively transported in an energy-dependent process across this blood-brain barrier model in a temperature-dependent fashion, presumably by receptor mediated uptake.\n\n\n \nFIG. 9\n confirms that transcytosis of p97 is also a saturable phenomenon, thus further implicating a specific MTf-receptor protein in this model of the blood-brain barrier. These experiments were conducted as previously described. Measurements of the amount of transcytosis were made at the time points indicated.\n\n\n \nFIG. 10\n assesses the ability of several agents to interfere with p97 transyctosis. \nFIG. 10\n \na\n, transcytosis of I125-P97 was compared in the presence of cold p97 (5 micromolar), Lf (5 micromolar), and Tf (5 micromolar). \nFIG. 10\n \nb\n, β-amyloid protein (5 micromolar) also failed to slow or reduce transcytosis of labelled p97. \nFIG. 10\n \nc\n, RAP, a known poly-peptide inhibitor of the LDL-Receptor family was applied to the cells (25 micrograms/ml). RAP significantly inhibited the transcytosis of p97, thus directly implicating the LDL-receptor family, especially LRP1 as the MTf-R.\n\n\n \nFIG. 11\n examines the accumulation and transcytosis of p97. \nFIG. 11\n \na\n, of [\n125\nI]-p97, [\n125\nI]-BSA and [\n125\nI]-holo-transferrin one hour after i.v. injection.

Overview\n\n\nThe present invention provides, inter alfa, novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods for modulating the activity of the melanotransferrin receptor and for modulating the transcytosis, endocytosis, and blood brain barrier transport of active agents conjugated to melanotransferrin (“MTf” or “p97”) or other ligands of LRP1, and more particularly, LRP1B. It also provides screening methods for identifying such compounds, compositions, and methods. The invention is based on the discovery, disclosed here for the first time, that melanotransferrin binding to brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) is competitively inhibited by lactoferrin (Lf), RAP, and β-amyloid protein, but not significantly by transferrin (Tf) or bovine serum albumin (BSA). This binding spectra establishes the p97 receptor is a member of the family of LRP family. This assignment is consistent with the characterization herein of the mechanism for p97 transcytosis and endocytosis.\n\n\nThe BCEC receptor for MTf is therefore not the transferrin receptor (Tf-R), as previously hypothesized, but an unrelated class of receptor (herein called the “MTf-R” or “p97 receptor”) for which Lf is a competitive inhibitor of p97. This surprising discovery provides a new pathway for the uptake of MTf into the brain; and simultaneously identifies a new role for receptors of lactoferrin and/or β-amyloid proteins in BCECs, namely MTf binding and uptake.\n\n\nThe invention also relates to the unexpected discovery that LRP1B is a major p97 receptor involved in the transcytosis and endocytosis of p97. Applicants have, for instance, found that p97 binds to the LRP1B receptor to form a high molecule weight complex which is dissociable and subject to competitive inhibition. Applicants have also found that the trancystosis and uptake of p97 in cells is associated with their expression of the LRP1B gene and that LRP1B is induced by treatment with p97.\n\n\nIn addition, it has been discovered that, in contrast to several other tumors, the LRP1B gene is upregulated in astrocytomas. In a preferred embodiment, therefore, p97 and ligands binding LRP1B are conjugated to chemotherapeutic agents active against such cells.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment of the invention, MTf-R biological activity is modulated to influence blood-brain barrier transport of compounds conjugated to p97, and in a further preferred embodiment, MTf-R biological activity is modulated to influence the transport of melanotransferrin conjugated therapeutic agents (MTf-TA) into the brain.\n\n\nIn a further preferred embodiment, modulation of delivery across the blood-brain barrier is achieved by modulating the activity and/or expression of MTf-Rs on the serum face (i.e., the apical side, or the “inside” of the blood vessel) of brain capillary endothelial cells. The present invention therefore provides, inter alfa, methods of modulating MTf-TA uptake into the brain, compositions useful for modulating MTf-TA uptake into the brain, and screening assays and methods for identifying modulators of MTf-TA uptake into the brain. The screening assays and compounds identified using such screening assays can also be used for modulating the expression and/or activity of Lf-Rs in general, and thus for treating the diseases and disorders associated with the expression and/or activity of Lf-Rs, such as those disclosed hereinbelow.\n\n\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) performs a neuroprotective function by tightly controlling access to the brain; consequently it also impedes access of pharmacological agents to cerebral tissues, necessitating the use of vectors for their transit. We have discovered that recombinant human melanotransferrin is highly transported into the brain by using animal models and a well-defined in vitro model of the BBB. Transcytosis of p97 is at least 14-fold higher than that of holo-transferrin, with no apparent intraendothelial degradation. The transport of p97 is not due to changes in endothelial barrier integrity but to receptor-mediated endocytosis. We have also discovered a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor protein family, likely LRP, is involved in p97 transendothelial transport. The brain accumulation, high rate of p97 transcytosis and its very low level in the blood (100.000-fold lower than transferrin) indicate that p97 is particularly and advantageous carrier as a delivery system to target drugs directly to the brain.\n\n\nBlood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability is frequently a rate-limiting factor for the penetration of drugs or peptides into the central nervous system (CNS) (see Pardridge, W. M. \nJ. Neurovirol. \n5: 556-569 (1999), Bickel, U., Yoshikawa, T. & Pardridge, W. M. \nAdv. Drug Deliv. Rev. \n46: 247-279 (2001)). The brain is shielded against potentially toxic substances by the BBB, which is formed by brain capillary endothelial cells that are closely sealed by tight junctions. In addition, brain capillaries possess few fenestrae and few endocytic vesicles, compared to the capillaries of other organs (see Pardridge, W. M. \nJ. Neurovirol. \n5: 556-569 (1999)). There is little transit across the BBB of large, hydrophilic molecules aside from some specific proteins such as transferrin, lactoferrin and low-density lipoproteins, which are taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis (see Pardridge, W. M. \nJ. Neurovirol. \n5: 556-569 (1999); Tsuji, A. & Tamai, I. \nAdv. Drug Deliv. Rev. \n36: 277-290 (1999); Kusuhara, H. & Sugiyama, Y. \nDrug Discov.

Chem. \n274: 7011-7017 (1999)).\n\n\nMelanotransferrin is a glycosylated protein that was first named human melanoma antigen p97 when it was found at high levels in malignant melanoma cells (see Brown, J. P., Woodbury, R. G., Hart, C. E., Hellstrom, I. & Hellstrom, K. E. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n78: 539-543 (1981); and Brown, J. P. et al. \nNature \n296:171-173 (1982)). It was later renamed Mtf due to its high level of sequence homology (37-39%) with human serum transferrin, human lactoferrin and chicken transferrin. (See Brown, J. P. et al. \nNature \n296:171-173 (1982), Rose, T. M. et al. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n83, 1261-1265 (1986)). In contrast to transferrin and lactoferrin, no cellular receptor for p97 has been identified. It has also been shown that p97 reversibly binds iron and that it exists in two forms, one of which is bound to cell membranes by a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor while the other form is both soluble and actively secreted (see Baker, E. N. et al. \nFEBS Lett. \n298: 215-218 (1992); Alemany, R. et al. \nJ. Cell Sci. \n104: 1155-1162 (1993); and Food M. R. et al. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n269: 3034-3040 (1994)). The exact physiological role of membrane-bound p97 remains to be clearly established while the function of secreted p97 is largely unexplored (see Sekyere, E. and Richardson, D. R. \nFEBS Lett. \n483: 11-16, (2000)).\n\n\nMore recently, it was reported that p97 mRNA is also widespread in normal human tissues, with the highest levels in salivary glands (see Richardson, D. R. \nEur J. Biochem. \n267: 1290-1298 (2000)). In normal human brain, p97 is present in capillary endothelium whereas in brain from patients with Alzheimer's disease it is located in microglial cells associated with senile plaques (see Rothenberger, S. et al. \nBrain Res. \n712: 117-121 (1996); Jefferies, W. A. et al. \nBrain Res. \n712: 122-126 (1996); and Yamada, T. et al. \nBrain Res. \n845: 1-5 (1999)). Serum contains very low levels of p97 (Brown, J. P., Woodbury, R. G., Hart, C. E., Hellstrom, I. & Hellstrom, K. E. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n78: 539-543 (1981). The fact that p97 levels are very low in serum while high p97 levels are reported in senile plaques shows that p97 crosses the BBB to a greater extent than do other proteins present in the serum.\n\n\nTo investigate this hypothesis we evaluated the uptake of p97 in brain following its administration in animals and compared it to those of holo-transferrin and bovine serum albumin (BSA). We further studied and characterized p97 transcytosis using a well-established model of the BBB, consisting of bovine brain endothelial cells (BBCECs) co-cultured with rat astrocytes. (see Fillebeen, C. et al. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n274: 7011-7017 (1999); (Dehouck, M. P. et al. \nJ. Neurochem. \n58: 1790-1797 (1992)). We also used isolated human brain capillaries for measuring p97 uptake.\n\n\nThe results obtained with in vivo and in vitro models show a much greater passage of p97 across the BBB than holo-transferrin and further indicate the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) might be involved in its passage.\n\n\np97 transcytosis is 14 times higher than transferrin transcytosis. Transcytosis is mediated by a receptor as it is temperature sensitive, saturable, and p97 conformation-dependent. Transcytosis of p97 occurs without compromising the structural integrity of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and p97 is not substantially degraded.\n\n\nB. Definitions\n\n\n“Melanotransferrin,” as used herein, is sometimes referred to as “MTf” or “p97”. As used in this disclosure, MTf includes membrane bound p97 (i.e., p97 attached to a GPI anchor or some other anchor), secreted p97, soluble p97, cleaved p97, analogs of p97 which are equivalents of p97 (having greater than 40% homology at the peptide sequence level, including allelic variants of p97), human, mouse, chicken and/or rabbit p97, and derivatives, portions, or fragments thereof. p97 can be in the form of acidic or basic salts, or in its neutral form. In addition, individual amino acid residues can be modified, such as by oxidation or reduction. Moreover, various substitutions, deletions, or additions can be made to the amino acid or nucleic acid sequences, the net effect of which is to retain or improve upon the desired biological activity of p97. Due to code degeneracy, for example, there may be considerable variation in nucleotide sequences encoding the same amino acid sequence.\n\n\n“p97 fragment,” as used herein, includes any portion of p97 or its biologically equivalent analogs that contains a sufficient portion of p97 to enable it to bind to the MTf-R and to be transported across the blood-brain barrier; or that otherwise retains or improves upon the desired biological activities of p97.\n\n\n“Melanotransferrin conjugated therapeutic agent” or, alternatively, “MTf-TA,” as used herein, refers to a composition comprising p97 or a p97 fragment covalently conjugated to another compound. The conjugation can be direct or indirect (i.e., through an extended linker) so long as it is a chemical conjugation. Linkers may be as taught in U.S. Provisional Patent Application titled, “The Use of Isocyanate Linkers for the Synthesis of Hydrolyzable Active Agent Biopolymer Conjugates” with inventors Qingqi Chen, Damian Sowa, and Reinhard Gabathuler, filed on Jul. 12, 2002 and assigned to the same assignee as the present application, and herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nThe general construct of the MTf-TA of the present invention is as follows:\n\n \n \n \n \np97-Linker-Compound\n \n \n \n\n\nMelanotransferrin conjugated therapeutic agents (MTf-TAs) can be used to treat many diseases including, but not limited to, neurological diseases and conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy and others; neurological cancers, such as primary brain tumors including glioma, meningioma, neurinoma, pituitary adenoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, hemangioma, epidermoid, sarcoma and intracranial metastasis from other tumor sources; and neurological infections or inflammatory conditions. Further, MTf-TAs can be used to treat non-CNS (i.e., non-BBB delimited) diseases, such as cancers, diseases and conditions of non-CNS organs. Detailed descriptions of MTf-TAs and their uses are set out in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 60/226,242 and 60/226,254, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n“Modulate,” as used herein, refers to the ability to alter, by increase or decrease (e.g., to act as an antagonist or agonist).\n\n\n“Melanotransferrin receptor” (“MTf-R”), as used herein, refers to any biological system that specifically or preferentially binds MTf. This term is intended to include those receptors which competitively bind Lf and/or β-amyloid protein, but excludes those receptors which are specific for Tf such as the transferrin receptor (Tf-R) (which is described at OMIM #*190010, and which is also known as TFR, TRFR and CD71). A receptor known to specifically or preferentially bind Lf is herein called a “lactotransferrin receptor” (Lf-R). Known Lf-Rs include, but are not limited to, the LDL-related receptors. A known LDL-related receptor is lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha2-macroglobulin receptor (“LRP1”). The term MTf-R specifically includes other receptors found on endothelial cells that specifically bind both MTf and Lf, but not Tf. In a preferred embodiment, the MTf-R is the LRP1. In a more preferred embodiment, the MTf-R is LRP1B.\n\n\nMembers of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family include LDL-R (132 kDa); LRP/LRP1 and LRP1B (600 kDa); Megalin ((LRP2), 600 kDa); VLDL-R (130 kDa); ER-2 (LRP-8, 130 kDa); Mosaic LDL-R (LR11, 250 KDa); and other members such as LRP3, LRP6, and LRP-7. Characteristic features of the LDL-R family include cell-surface expression; extracellular ligand binding domain repeats (DxSDE); requirement of Ca++ for ligand binding; recognition of RAP and ApoE; EGF precursor homology domain repeats (YWTD); single membrane spanning region; internalization signal in the cytoplasmic domain (FDNPXY); and receptor mediated endocytosis of various ligands.\n\n\nLRP refers to the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein and members of this receptor family. LRP is a large protein of 4525 amino acids (600 kDa) which is cleaved by furin to produce two subunits of 515-(α) and 85-(β) kDa that remain non-covalently bound. LRP is mainly expressed in the liver, kidney, neuron, CNS, BBB, SMC and various cultured cells.\n\n\nLRP ligands. A number of molecules are known to bind LRP. These molecules include, for instance, lactoferrin, RAP, lipoprotein lipase, ApoE, Factor VIII, β-amyloid precursor, α2-macroglobulin, \nthrombospondin\n 2 MMP-2, MPP-9-TIMP-1; uPA:PAI-I:uPAR; and tPA:PAI-1:uPAR (see also \nFIG. 23\n).\n\n\n \nLRP\n 1B is a recently discovered member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family. 600 kDa multifunctional cell surface receptor. See Liu et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276 (31):28889-28896 (2001). See also Liu et al., Genomics 69, 271-274 (2000); and Liu et al., Cancer Res. 60, 1961-1967 (2000). This receptor is more closely related to LRP than megalin and shares a 59% homology at cDNA level and a 52% homology at predicted amino acid level, the \nLRP\n 1B gene is expressed in the brain, thyroid and salivary gland. Known ligands for \nLRP\n 1B include RAP, tPA, PAI-1.\n\n\nMouse LRP1B is accessible through GenBank Accession Nos. XM 143023 XM 130241. Human LRP1B is accessible through GenBank Accession Nos. XM 015452.\n\n\n“Lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha2-macroglobulin receptor” (“LRP1”), as used herein, refers to a multifunctional receptor. It is believed that the clustering of cysteine-rich type. A binding repeats, resembling those found in the LDL receptor, is the molecular principle for the ability to bind a variety of ligands that were previously thought to be unrelated: activated alpha-2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein E, lipoprotein lipase, plasminogen activators and complexes with their inhibitor (PA and PA/PAI-1), lipoprotein(a), pseudomonas exotoxin A, human rhinovirus, Lf and the so-called receptor associated protein (RAP). See, Meilinger, et al., \nFEBS Let., \n360:70-74 (1995).\n\n\nLRPI is accessible through GenBank Accession No.: X 13916 and Swiss-Prot Primary Accession No.: Q07954.\n\n\nAlternative names for the LRP1 gene/protein include: Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 [precursor], LRP, Alpha-2-macroglobulin receptor, A2MR, Apolipoprotein E receptor, APOER, CD91, LRP1 or A2MR.\n\n\nThe screening assays and other embodiments of this invention can also employ homologs of human LRP1 (hLRP1) or LRP1B. Such homologs can be derived from other organisms, specifically eukaryotes and preferably from mammals.\n\n\nPreferred homologs of human LRP include, but are not limited to, the following LRP proteins:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nH. sapiens\n:\n\n\nSP: Q07954 - LRP1_HUMAN LOW-\nDENSITY\n \n\n\n100%/4543 aa \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR-RELATED \nPROTEIN\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1 PRECURSOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nM. musculus\n:\n\n\nPID: g49942 - AM2 receptor\n\n\n97%/4543 aa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nR. norvegicus\n:\n\n\nSP: P98158 - LRP2 RAT LOW-DENSITY\n\n\n39%/4207 aa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR-RELATED \nPROTEIN\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2 PRECURSOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nD. melanogaster\n:\n\n\nSP: P98163 - YL DROME PUTATIVE\n\n\n28%/1550 aa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVITELLOGENIN RECEPTOR PRECURSOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nC. elegans\n:\n\n\nPID: g3876533 - predicted using \nGenefinder\n \n\n\n35%/4205 aa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nS. cerevisiae\n:\n\n\nPID: g557822 - mal5, stal, len: 1367.

RAGE was originally identified and characterized based on its ability to bind advanced glycation end products (AGEs), adducts formed by glycoxidation that accumulate in disorders such as diabetes and renal failure. Subsequent studies demonstrate that RAGE serves as a cell surface receptor for amyloid-β peptide (the cleavage product of β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP), a major component of neuritic plaques of Alzheimer's Disease). Other ligands include amphoterin and s100/calgranulin-like molecules (see, Hofmann, et al., \nCell, \n97(7):889-901 (1999)). RAGE is readily accessible through GenBank Accession No.: M91211 and Swiss-Prot Primary Accession No.: Q15109.\n\n\nBy “determining the functional effect” is meant assaying for a compound that modulates, e.g., increases or decreases, a parameter that is indirectly or directly under the influence of the MTf-R, e.g., functional, physical and chemical effects. In addition to the functional effects specifically described herein, it will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art that other functional effects can be measured by any means known to those skilled in the art, e.g., changes in spectroscopic characteristics (e.g., fluorescence, absorbance, refractive index), hydrodynamic (e.g., shape), chromatographic, or solubility properties, changes in gene expression of MTf-Rs, and the like.\n\n\n“Inhibitors,” “activators” and “modulators” of MTf-Rs are used interchangeably to refer to inhibitory, activating or modulating compounds identified using in vitro and/or in vivo assays for MTF-R.\n\n\nSamples or assays comprising MTf-Rs that are treated with a potential activator, inhibitor, or modulator are compared to control samples without the inhibitor, activator, or modulator to examine the extent of inhibition. Control samples (untreated with inhibitors) are assigned a relative MTf-R activity value of 100%. Inhibition of a MTf-R is achieved when the MTf-R activity value relative to the control is about 80%, preferably 50%, more preferably 25-0%. Activation of a MTf-R is achieved when the MTf-R activity value relative to the control (untreated with activators) is 110%, more preferably 150%, more preferably 200-500% (i.e., two to five fold higher relative to the control), more preferably 1000-3000% higher.\n\n\nC. Screening Assays for Modulators of Melanotransferrin Receptors (MTf-Rs)\n\n\nThe present invention provides a screening assay employing an MTf-R, wherein compounds are tested for their ability to influence a measurable activity of the MTf-R. The MTf-R can be situated in a whole cell, a cell extract, semi-purified, purified or any other format that allows for measurement of its activity. The activity can be any activity in the expression, function or degradation of MTf-R including, for example, the amount or timing of such activities. Such activities include, for example, transcription, transcript processing, translation or transcript stability of the MTf-R gene sequence or mRNA transcript. Such activities include, for example, the synthesis of new MTf-R, the sub-cellular localization of MTf-R and activation of MTf-R biological activity. Such activities include, for example, the ability of MTf-R to bind substances, adopt conformations, catalyze reactions, bind known ligands and the like. Such activities include, for example, the amount or stability of MTf-R, the processing and removal or degradation of MTf-R and the like. In preferred embodiments, the MTf-R receptor for use in screening is LRP1 or LRP1B.\n\n\nIn a preferred screening assay, compounds are tested to identify modulators of a biological activity of MTf-R such as: MTf-R interactions with MTf, MTf-R interactions with Lf or other putative ligands or uptake of iron/other metal; transport of MTf across the blood-brain barrier (“BBB”), i.e., in a BBB model; transport of Lf, other ligands or metals across a BBB model; and/or measurement of the rate or amount of transcription, translation or expression levels of MTF-R genes or mRNA.\n\n\nThe invention contemplates a variety of different screening formats. Some designs are considered low throughput and test only one or a few compounds in series or in parallel. High throughput screening assays are suitable for screening tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of compounds in a matter of weeks or months. “In silico” screening formats employ computer-aided rational design techniques to identify potential modulators of MTf-R biological activity.\n\n\nThe test compounds of the invention may be obtained from any source, but a preferred commercial embodiment employs commercially available compound libraries of hundreds of thousands of compounds, many of which are potential therapeutic agents. These compounds are tested in series or in parallel to identify modulating activity of MTf-R activity. Preferred test compounds can be identified by examining known and putative ligands of MTf-R for predicting chemical structure of inhibitors, etc. Other computer-aided design techniques can be employed to eliminate unsuitable candidates, such as those candidates thought to cause toxic side-effects. Those skilled in the art are familiar with the combinatorial and medicinal chemistry techniques that can be used to further select test compounds and the potential therapeutic agents of the invention.\n\n\nThe object of the screening assays is to identify modulators of MTf-R activity that are suitable for animal or human clinical trials and as therapeutic agents. As such, the screening assays identify stimulants, agonists or antagonists of MTf-R. The method of identifying stimulants, agonists or antagonists of MTf-R can comprise contacting a substance suspected of being a stimulant, agonist or antagonist with MTf and the MTf-R under conditions such that MTf is capable of binding to the MTf-R; measuring the amount of MTf bound to the MTf-R; and determining the effect of the substance by comparing the amount of MTf bound to MTf-R with an amount determined for a control. The MTf that can be used in this method includes MTf cleaved of GPI, soluble MTf, cleaved MTf or derivatives thereof, preferably recombinant MTf. In this method of the invention, the amount of MTf bound to MTf-R can be determined by measuring the amount of MTf bound to the MTf-R, the amount of unbound MTf or the amount of unbound MTf-R. MTf bound to MTf-R can be isolated by conventional isolation techniques, for example, salting out, chromatography, electrophoresis, gel filtration, fractionation, absorption, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, agglutination, or combinations thereof. To facilitate the measurement of MTf bound to MTf-R or of unbound MTf, or unbound MTf-R, antibodies against MTf or MTf-R can, for example, be utilized.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the invention also relates to a method for identifying a stimulant, agonist or antagonist of MTf-mediated iron uptake comprising: incubating a cell expressing MTf-R on its surface and a test substance (e.g., compound) suspected of being a stimulant, agonist or antagonist of MTf-R in the presence of MTf bound to iron (holo-MTf) and in the absence of transferrin, measuring the amount of iron uptake into the cell and identifying a stimulant, agonist or antagonist of MTf-R mediated iron uptake by comparing the amount of iron uptake in the cell with the amount of iron uptake in a cell from a control incubation in the absence of the test substance. Iron uptake refers to the internalization of iron into the cell across the cell plasma membrane.\n\n\nD. Modulating Uptake of Melanotransferrin Conjugated Therapeutic Agents (MTf-TAs) by Modulating MTf-R Activity\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of using compounds that modulate MTf-R biological activity to modulate the amount of uptake into the cells of melanotransferrin conjugated therapeutic agents (MTf-TAs). In particular, the invention relates to a method of increasing the uptake of an MTf-TA into the brain, the method comprising administering a modulator of MTf-R biological activity either contemporaneously or sequentially with the MTf-TA. Alternatively, the invention relates to a method to reduce uptake of an MTf-TA into the brain comprising administering a modulator of MTf-R biological activity either contemporaneously or sequentially with the MTf-TA. In a preferred embodiment, these methods employ modulators of MTf-R that are first identified using a screening assay as described hereinabove. In preferred embodiments, the MTf-R receptor for use in screening is LRP1 or LRP1B.\n\n\nThose skilled in the art will appreciate that increasing MTf-TA uptake and delivery across the blood-brain barrier is useful and desirable in situations such as, but not limited to, where the MTf-TA is being used to treat a neurological condition and increased amounts of delivery provide therapeutic benefit. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that decreasing MTf-TA uptake and delivery across the blood-brain barrier is useful and desirable for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, where the MTf-TA is being used for its cardio-protective effect or used in other (non-CNS) organs and side-effects of brain uptake are to be avoided.\n\n\nModulators of MTf-R activity can be readily identified using a modification of the transwell apparatus set out in Example I below. In the modified form, a compound is added to the luminal surface of the cells in the transwell apparatus in combination with MTf-TAs. The compound is then scored to determine if it increases or decreases the transport of the MTf-TA across the BBCECs to the abluminal side. A library of compounds can be readily screened or tested to identify pharmacologically superior modulators.\n\n\nE. Diseases Treatable by Lf-R Modulators\n\n\nAs a result of the surprising discovery that certain MTf-Rs are Lf-Rs, it has now been discovered that modulators of Lf-R biological activity can have an impact on disease processes known to be linked to MTf biological activity. As such, the following uses for modulators of Lf-Rs identified, for example, by the screening assays of the present invention have now been identified.\n\n\n1) Rapidly proliferating cells, such as malignant cells, have an increased requirement for iron and must possess efficient mechanisms to obtain iron. Limiting the ability of malignant cells to acquire iron provides a method of killing tumor cells or of modulating their uncontrolled cell growth.\n\n\n2) These findings lead to the discovery that modulators of Lf-R can be used to modulate iron uptake in cells. Iron uptake in cells can be modulated by varying the amount of Lf-R on cell surfaces, or by inhibiting Lf-R binding to MTf. Accordingly, stimulants, agonists or antagonists of Lf-R can be useful in the treatment of conditions or diseases where there is a disturbance in iron metabolism. For example, such substances are useful in the treatment of conditions such as hemochromatosis, neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic tissue damage, including ischemic stroke or trauma, heart disease and tumors (e.g., skin cancer).\n\n\n3) MTf plays a role in the binding and uptake of other metals such as zinc and aluminum (Sekyere, E. and Richardson, D. R., \nFEBS Letters, \n483:11-16 (2000) and, thus, modulation of Lf-R activity or expression plays a role in modulating or regulating Alzheimer's Disease or metaloproteins, such as zinc-dependent metaloproteins.\n\n\n4) Conditions that involve disturbances in iron metabolism that can be treated using the compounds and methods of the invention (i.e., using stimulants, agonists and antagonists of MTf-mediated iron uptake) are, for example, those involving excessive iron absorption from the diet, defects in iron uptake into cells, excessive iron uptake into cells or those requiring regular treatment by blood transfusion (e.g., dyserythropoietic anemias, in particular thalassaemia disorders. Examples of such conditions include, but are not limited to, hemochromatosis, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease and Parkinson's Disease), ischemic tissue damage, heart disease and tumors, inflammation and infections (see, Pippard, “Clinical Use of Iron Chelation,” in \nIron in Immunity, Cancer and Inflammation \n(M. de Sousa and J. H. Brock (Eds.), 1989, John Wiley & Sons), which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n5) Diseases which can be treated using modulators of Lf-R activity or expression include neurological diseases and conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy and others, neurological cancers, such as primary brain tumors including glioma, meningioma, neurinoma, pituitary adenoma, medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, hemangioma, epidermoid, sarcoma and intracranial metastasis from other tumor sources, and neurological infections or inflammatory conditions. odulators of Lf-R activity or expression can be used to treat non-CNS (i.e., non-BBB delimited) diseases, such as cancers, diseases and conditions of non-CNS organs.\n\n\nOnce a potential therapeutic agent has been identified from among the test compounds, those skilled in the art are familiar with the basic pharmacological steps required to develop an acceptable human or animal therapeutic agent. For example, therapeutic doses can be derived from animal studies and human clinical trials, as can suitable pharmacological carriers and excipients.\n\n\nF. Therapeutic and Diagnostic Uses of MTf-R Proteins/Polypeptides\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the instant invention, a method is provided for administering a MTf-R protein, or a fragment thereof, to an animal in need thereof, to effect a therapeutic or prophylactic result. In vivo an MTf-R protein or fragment thereof will bind to MTf and effectively reduce the circulating concentration of MTf. This treatment is useful in diseases where increased levels of MTf are known to be implicated in disease progression, particularly, Alzheimer's Disease (see, Kennard, et al., \nNat. Med., \n2:1230-1235 (1996); U.S. Pat. No. 5,981,194). As a diagnostic tool, administration of an MTf-R protein or a fragment thereof, labeled with a detectable label, will identify the location or amount of MTf in the subject. Such a tool would be particularly useful for finding tumor cells that are known to express higher levels of MTf. Presumably, labeling of MTf-R with a strong beta emitting particle, such as certain Iodine or Yttrium isotopes, would assist in killing tumor cells to which the MTf-R would bind.\n\n\nOther therapeutical targets relate to HIV infection as a TAT receptor, activation of the NMDA receptor with respect to synaptic plasticity, Alzheimer's disease as LRP is a receptor for APoE, alpha2-macroglobulin, APP which have all been linked to this disease; and in the regulation of lipid degrading lysosomal enzymes (SAP-dependent).\n\n\nG. MTf-R Antibodies\n\n\nAntibodies that specifically recognize one or more epitopes of MTf-R, or epitopes of conserved variants of MTf-R, or peptide fragments of MTf-R are also encompassed by the invention. Such antibodies include, but are not limited to, polyclonal antibodies, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), humanized or chimeric antibodies, single chain antibodies, Fab fragments, F(ab′)2 fragments, fragments produced by a Fab expression library, anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies, and epitope-binding fragments of any of the above.\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention can be used, for example, in conjunction with compound screening assays, as described above, for the evaluation of the effect of test compounds on expression and/or activity of the MTf-R gene product. Additionally, such antibodies can be used in conjunction with gene therapy techniques to, for example, evaluate the success of transfection of normal and/or engineered MTf-R-expression. Such antibodies can be used as antagonists of MTf-R biological activity, and can additionally be used as a method for the inhibition of abnormal MTf-R activity. Thus, such antibodies can be utilized as therapeutic agents according to this invention.\n\n\nThe MTf-R antibodies of the invention can also be used in diagnostic techniques to identify the location, quantity, behavior and/or the like of MTf-R in an animal.\n\n\nFor the production of antibodies, various host animals may be immunized by injection with the MTf-R, a MTf-R protein or peptide (e.g., one corresponding to a functional domain of the receptor), truncated MTf-R polypeptides (MTf-R in which one or more domains has been deleted), functional equivalents of the MTf-R or mutants of the MTf-R. Such host animals include, but are not limited to, rabbits, mice, and rats, to name but a few. Various adjuvants can be used to increase the immunological response, depending on the host species including, but not limited to, Freund's (complete and incomplete), mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide, surface active substances such as lysolecithin, pluronic polyols, polyanions, peptides, oil emulsions, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, dinitrophenol, and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guerin) and \nCorynebacterium parvum\n. Polyclonal antibodies are heterogeneous populations of antibody molecules derived from the sera of the immunized animals.\n\n\nH. MTf-R Antisense Oligonucleotides and Ribozymes\n\n\nThe present invention also encompasses the use of antisense oligonucleotide sequences having sequences specific for hybridization to the MTf-R (e.g., LRP1 or LRP1B) mRNA or precursor RNA, i.e., sequences that specifically or selectively hybridize to MTf-R or mRNA or precursor RNA. Those skilled in the art can readily identify suitable antisense oligonucleotide sequences based on the known MTf-R mRNA sequence referenced above. Those skilled in the art are aware of modifications to the chemistry of oligonucleotides that improve their clinical utility, such as phosphorothioate modifications. MTf-R antisense oligonucleotides are an example of compounds that can be used to modulate MTf-R expression and, in particular, to down-regulate such expression. Those skilled in the art are also able to design ribozymes which achieve similar objectives. Methods of delivering such nucleic acids are described below.\n\n\nI. MTf-R Gene Therapy\n\n\nCertain embodiments of the invention employ the use of the MTf-R gene in a gene therapy method. The object of such intervention is to deliver a functional copy of the MTf-R gene to a cell in need thereof in order to increase the transcription and subsequent translation and expression of the MTf-R protein in the cell. Those skilled in the art are familiar with viral, non-viral (i.e., lipid based), naked DNA and polymeric methods of delivering gene therapy vectors that include the MTf-R gene. Such methods can employ in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy techniques known to and used by those of skill in the art.\n\n\nJ. Diagnosis of Neurological Diseases\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to the diagnosis of a neurological disease comprising detecting the amount or activity of MTf-R expressed at the BBB, in neural tissue or in any tissue associated with a non-CNS target organ, such as the lung, liver, kidney, spleen, etc. The diagnostic method employs a diagnostic agent comprising an agent specific for MTf-R (i.e., an MTf-R antibody, a ligand such as MTf or Lf, or another ligand which specifically binds MTf-R) and a detectable conjugate or label (i.e., radioisotopes of technetium or iodine). Those skilled in the art can identify diseases or conditions for which the determination of MTf-R amount or localization is relevant. Most preferred are diseases or conditions, such as Alzheimer's Disease, in which MTf-R is directly implicated as a result of the present invention.\n\n\nK.

Active Agents\n\n\nActive agents according to the invention include agents that affect any biological process. The term “drug” or “therapeutic agent” refers to an active agent that has a pharmacological activity or benefits health when administered in a therapeutically effective amount. Examples of drugs or therapeutic agents include substances that are used in the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation, treatment or cure of a disease or condition.\n\n\nThe active agent conjugated to the p97 protein or fragment or LRP1 modulator or LRP ligand may be any molecule, as well as any binding portion or fragment thereof, that is capable of modulating a biological process in a living host. Generally, the active agent may be of any size, but is preferably a small organic molecule that is capable of binding to the target of interest. A drug moiety of the conjugate, when a small molecule, generally has a molecular weight of at least about 50 D, usually at least about 100 D, where the molecular weight may be as high as 500 D or higher, but will usually not exceed about 2000 D.\n\n\nThe drug moiety is capable of interacting with a target in the host into which the conjugate is administered during practice of the subject methods. The target may be a number of different types of naturally occurring structures, where targets of interest include both intracellular and extracellular targets, where such targets may be proteins, phospholipids, nucleic acids and the like, where proteins are of particular interest. Specific proteinaceous targets of interest include, without limitation, enzymes, e.g., kinases, phosphatases, reductases, cyclooxygenases, proteases and the like, targets comprising domains involved in protein-protein interactions, such as the SH2, SH3, PTB and PDZ domains, structural proteins, e.g., actin, tubulin, etc., membrane receptors, immunoglobulins, e.g., IgE, cell adhesion receptors, such as integrins, etc, ion channels, transmembrane pumps, transcription factors, signaling proteins, and the like.\n\n\nThe active agent or drug has a hydroxy or an amino group for reacting with the isocyanate reagent or the active agent is chemically modified to introduce a hydroxy or an amino group for reacting with the isocyanate reagent.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the active agent or drug will also comprise a region that may be modified and/or participate in covalent linkage, preferably, without loss of the desired biological activity of the active agent. The drug moieties often comprise cyclical carbon or heterocyclic structures and/or aromatic or polyaromatic structures substituted with one or more of the above functional groups. Also of interest as drug moieties are structures found among biomolecules, proteins, enzymes, polysaccharides, and polynucleic acids, including peptides, saccharides, fatty acids, steroids, purines, pyrimidines, derivatives, structural analogs or combinations thereof.\n\n\nThe conjugate can comprise one or more active agents linked to the same biopolymer. For example, conjugation reactions may conjugate from 1 to 5, about 5, about 1-10, about 5 to 10, about 10-20, about 20-30, or 30 or more molecules of an active agent to the biopolymer. These formulations can be employed as mixtures, or they may be purified into specific (mol:mol) formulations. Those skilled in the art are able to determine which format and which mol:mol ratio is preferred. Further, more than one type of active agent may be linked to the biopolymer where delivery of more than one type of an agent to a target site or compartment is desired. A plurality of active agent species may be attached to the same biopolymers such as adriamycin-cisplatinum conjugate compositions where the biopolymer is a p97 related protein. Thus, the conjugates may consist of a range of mol:mol ratios and incorporate more than one type of active agent. These, too, may be separated into purified mixtures or they may be employed in aggregate. Active agents include those identified U.S. Pat. No. 6,372,712 which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nSpecific drugs of interest from which the drug moiety may be derived include, but are not limited to: psychopharmacological agents, such as (1) central nervous system depressants, e.g., general anesthetics (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, steroids, cyclohexanone derivatives, and miscellaneous agents), sedative-hypnotics (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, piperidinediones and triones, quinazoline derivatives, carbamates, aldehydes and derivatives, amides, acyclic ureides, benzazepines and related drugs, phenothiazines, etc.), central voluntary muscle tone modifying drugs (anticonvulsants, such as hydantoins, barbiturates, oxazolidinediones, succinimides, acylureides, glutarimides, benzodiazepines, secondary and tertiary alcohols, dibenzazepine derivatives, valproic acid and derivatives, GABA analogs, etc.), analgesics (morphine and derivatives, oripavine derivatives, morphinan derivatives, phenylpiperidines, 2,6-methane-3-benzazocaine derivatives, diphenylpropylamines and isosteres, salicylates, p-aminophenol derivatives, 5-pyrazolone derivatives, arylacetic acid derivatives, fenamates and isosteres, etc.) and antiemetics (anticholinergics, antihistamines, antidopaminergics, etc.), (2) central nervous system stimulants, e.g., analeptics (respiratory stimulants, convulsant stimulants, psychomotor stimulants), narcotic antagonists (morphine derivatives, oripavine derivatives, 2,6-methane-3-benzoxacine derivatives, morphinan derivatives) nootropics, (3) psychopharmacologicals, e.g., anxiolytic sedatives (benzodiazepines, propanediol carbamates) antipsychotics (phenothiazine derivatives, thioxanthine derivatives, other tricyclic compounds, butyrophenone derivatives and isosteres, diphenylbutylamine derivatives, substituted benzamides, arylpiperazine derivatives, indole derivatives, etc.), antidepressants (tricyclic compounds, MAO inhibitors, etc.), (4) respiratory tract drugs, e.g., central antitussives (opium alkaloids and their derivatives);

The conjugates of such drugs may be used for the same disorders, diseases, and indications as the drugs themselves.\n\n\nM. P97 and Modulators\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the active agent is conjugated to p97 or a modulator or ligand of the LRP receptor family (e.g. LRP1, LRP1B), or is an antibody which is capable of specifically binding to p97 or the modulator, such as an antibody to p97. In a further embodiment, the agent may be a substance having therapeutic activity such as a growth factor or lymphokine, enzyme or drug. The invention also relates to a method of delivering an active agent across the blood brain barrier comprising administering such a conjugate.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the p97 protein is soluble. p97 proteins as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,981,194 are particularly preferred. The p97 may be a human p97 protein or fragment thereof; the p97 may be from a mammal such as a mouse. Murine p97 is disclosed in WO 01/59549 A2 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n“p97” as used in the compositions of the invention, includes membrane bound p97 (i.e., p97 linked to GPI or other lipids), soluble p97, cleaved p97, analogs of p97 which are equivalents of p97 (having greater than 40%, 60%, 80%, or 90% homology at the peptide sequence level, including allelic variants of p97), human, mouse, chicken and/or rabbit p97, and derivatives, portions, or fragments thereof. p97 may be in the form of acidic or basic salts, or in neutral form. In addition, individual amino acid residues may be modified, such as by oxidation or reduction. Various substitutions, deletions, or additions may be made to the amino acid or DNA nucleic acid sequences, the net effect of which is to retain or improve upon the desired biological activity of p97. Due to code degeneracy, for example, there may be considerable variation in nucleotide sequences encoding the same amino acid sequence. As used herein, p97 also includes fragments of p97, including any portion of p97 or its biologically equivalent analogs that contain a sufficient portion of p97 and homology to the corresponding native p97 amino acid sequence to enable it to retain or improve upon the desired biological activities of p97. In other aspects, the invention is drawn to p97 conjugates which have only minor substitutions in the amino acid sequence which do not substantially affect its receptor binding or transcytosis properties.\n\n\nPreferred chemotherapeutic agents for use in p97-chemotherapeutic agent conjugates of the invention include all drugs which may be useful for treating brain tumours or other neoplasia in or around the brain, either in the free form, or, if not so useful in the free form, then useful when linked to p97. Such chemotherapeutic agents include adriamycin (also known as doxorubicin), cisplatin, paclitaxel, analogs thereof, and other chemotherapeutic agents which demonstrate activity against tumours ex vivo and in vivo. Such chemotherapeutic agents also include alkylating agents, antimetabolites, natural products (such as vinca alkaloids, epidophyllotoxins, antibiotics, enzymes and biological response modifiers), topoisomerase inhibitors, microtubule inhibitors, spindle poisons, hormones and antagonists, and miscellaneous agents such as platinum coordination complexes, anthracendiones, substituted ureas, etc. those of skill in the art will know of other chemotherapeutic agents.\n\n\np97-chemotherapeutic agents can comprise one or more compound moieties linked to p97. For example, conjugation reactions may conjugate from 1 to 10 or more molecules of adriamycin to a single p97 molecule. Several atoms of gold or iodine can be conjugated to a single p97 polypeptide. These formulations can be employed as mixtures, or they may be purified into specific p97:compound (mol:mol) formulations. Those skilled in the art are able to determine which format and which mol:mol ratio is preferred. Further, mixtures of compounds may be linked to p97, such as the p97-adriamycin-cisplatinum composition set out in the examples. These p97-chemotherapeutic agents may consist of a range of mol:mol ratios. These, too, may be separated into purified mixtures or they may be employed in aggregate.\n\n\nThe compositions of the invention may also be used for delivering an agent across the blood eye barrier or blood placenta barrier\n\n\nThe compositions of the invention may also comprise a transcytosing or endocytosing ligand of the LRP1 or LRP1B receptor conjugated to an active agent.\n\n\nN. Labels\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the conjugate or modulator or LRP ligand according to the invention is labeled to facilitate its detection. A “label” or a “detectable moiety” is a composition detectable by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, chemical, or other physical means. For example, labels suitable for use in the present invention include, for example, radioactive labels (e.g., \n32\nP), fluorophores (e.g., fluorescein), electron-dense reagents, enzymes (e.g., as commonly used in an ELISA), biotin, digoxigenin, or haptens and proteins which can be made detectable, e.g., by incorporating a radiolabel into the hapten or peptide, or used to detect antibodies specifically reactive with the hapten or peptide.\n\n\nAs noted above, depending on the screening assay employed, the drug, the linker or the p97 or modulator or ligand portion of a conjugate may be labeled. The particular label or detectable group used is not a critical aspect of the invention, as long as it does not significantly interfere with the biological activity of the conjugate. The detectable group can be any material having a detectable physical or chemical property. Thus, a label is any composition detectable by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, electrical, optical or chemical means.\n\n\nExamples of labels suitable for use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, fluorescent dyes (e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate, Texas red, rhodamine, and the like), radiolabels (e.g., \n3\nH, \n125\nI, \n35\nS, \n14\nC, or \n32\nP), enzymes (e.g., horse radish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase and others commonly used in an ELISA), and colorimetric labels such as colloidal gold or colored glass or plastic beads (e.g., polystyrene, polypropylene, latex, etc.).\n\n\nThe label may be coupled directly or indirectly to the desired component of the assay according to methods well known in the art. Preferably, the label in one embodiment is covalently bound to the biopolymer using an isocyanate reagent for conjugating an active agent according to the invention. In one aspect of the invention, the bifunctional isocyanate reagents of the invention can be used to conjugate a label to a biopolymer to form a label biopolymer conjugate without an active agent attached thereto. The label biopolymer conjugate may be used as an intermediate for the synthesis of a labeled conjugate according to the invention or may be used to detect the biopolymer conjugate. As indicated above, a wide variety of labels can be used, with the choice of label depending on sensitivity required, ease of conjugation with the desired component of the assay, stability requirements, available instrumentation, and disposal provisions. Non-radioactive labels are often attached by indirect means. Generally, a ligand molecule (e.g., biotin) is covalently bound to the molecule. The ligand then binds to another molecules (e.g., streptavidin) molecule, which is either inherently detectable or covalently bound to a signal system, such as a detectable enzyme, a fluorescent compound, or a chemiluminescent compound.\n\n\nThe conjugates can also be conjugated directly to signal generating compounds, e.g., by conjugation with an enzyme or fluorophore. Enzymes suitable for use as labels include, but are not limited to, hydrolases, particularly phosphatases, esterases and glycosidases, or oxidotases, particularly peroxidases. Fluorescent compounds, i.e., fluor ophores, suitable for use as labels include, but are not limited to, fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, umbelliferone, etc. Further examples of suitable fluorophores include, but are not limited to, eosin, TRITC-amine, quinine, fluorescein W, acridine yellow, lissamine rhodamine, B sulfonyl chloride erythroscein, ruthenium (tris, bipyridinium), Texas Red, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, flavin adenine dinucleotide, etc. Chemiluminescent compounds suitable for use as labels include, but are not limited to, luciferin and 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, e.g., luminol. For a review of various labeling or signal producing systems that can be used in the methods of the present invention, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,391,904.\n\n\nMeans of detecting labels are well known to those of skill in the art. Thus, for example, where the label is a radioactive label, means for detection include a scintillation counter or photographic film as in autoradiography. Where the label is a fluorescent label, it may be detected by exciting the fluorochrome with the appropriate wavelength of light and detecting the resulting fluorescence. The fluorescence may be detected visually, by the use of electronic detectors such as charge coupled devices (CCDs) or photomultipliers and the like. Similarly, enzymatic labels may be detected by providing the appropriate substrates for the enzyme and detecting the resulting reaction product. Colorimetric or chemiluminescent labels may be detected simply by observing the color associated with the label. Other labeling and detection systems suitable for use in the methods of the present invention will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art. Such labeled modulators and ligands may be used in the diagnosis of a disease or health condition.\n\n\nO. Methods of Using, Pharmaceutical Compositions, and their Administration\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” encompasses any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers, buffers and excipients, including phosphate-buffered saline solution, water, and emulsions (such as an oil/water or water/oil emulsion), and various types of wetting agents and/or adjuvants. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulations are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, 19th ed. 1995). Preferred pharmaceutical carriers depend upon the intended mode of administration of the active agent. Typical modes of administration are described below.\n\n\nThe term “effective amount” means a dosage sufficient to produce a desired result on a health condition, pathology, disease of a subject or for a diagnostic purpose. The desired result may comprise a subjective or objective improvement in the recipient of the dosage.\n\n\nA “prophylactic treatment” is a treatment administered to a subject who does not exhibit signs of a disease or exhibits only early signs of a disease, wherein treatment is administered for the purpose of decreasing the risk of developing a pathology. The conjugate compounds of the invention may be given as a prophylactic treatment.\n\n\nA “therapeutic treatment” is a treatment administered to a subject who exhibits signs of pathology, wherein treatment is administered for the purpose of diminishing or eliminating those pathological signs. The conjugate compounds, modulators, and ligands of the invention may be given as a prophylactic treatment or for diagnosis.\n\n\nThe term “composition”, as in pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a conjugate compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term “pharmaceutical composition” indicates a composition suitable for pharmaceutical use in a subject, including an animal or human. A pharmaceutical composition generally comprises an effective amount of a conjugate, modulator, or LRP ligand or LRP1B ligand and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\nThe conjugates, modulators, and LRP or LRP1B ligands may be administered by a variety of routes. For oral preparations, the conjugates can be used alone or in combination with appropriate additives to make tablets, powders, granules or capsules, for example, with conventional additives, such as lactose, mannitol, corn starch or potato starch; with binders, such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, corn starch or gelatins; with disintegrators, such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethylcellulose; with lubricants, such as talc or magnesium stearate; and if desired, with diluents, buffering agents, moistening agents, preservatives and flavoring agents.\n\n\nThe conjugates, modulators, and LRP or LRP1B ligands can be formulated into preparations for injection by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying them in an aqueous or nonaqueous solvent, such as vegetable or other similar oils, synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides, esters of higher aliphatic acids or propylene glycol; and if desired, with conventional additives such as solubilizers, isotonic agents, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers and preservatives.\n\n\nThe conjugates, modulators, and LRP or LRP1B ligands can be utilized in aerosol formulation to be administered via inhalation. The compounds of the present invention can be formulated into pressurized acceptable propellants such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen and the like.\n\n\nFurthermore, the conjugates, modulators, and LRP or LRP1B ligands can be made into suppositories by mixing with a variety of bases such as emulsifying bases or water-soluble bases. The compounds of the present invention can be administered rectally via a suppository. The suppository can include vehicles such as cocoa butter, carbowaxes and polyethylene glycols, which melt at body temperature, yet are solidified at room temperature.\n\n\nUnit dosage forms of the conjugate, modulator, and LRP or LRP1B ligand for oral or rectal administration such as syrups, elixirs, and suspensions may be provided wherein each dosage unit, for example, teaspoonful, tablespoonful, tablet or suppository, contains a predetermined amount of the composition containing active agent. Similarly, unit dosage forms for injection or intravenous administration may comprise the conjugate in a composition as a solution in sterile water, normal saline or another pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term “unit dosage form,” as used herein, refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human and animal subjects, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of compounds of the present invention calculated in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or vehicle. The specifications for the novel unit dosage forms of the present invention depend on the particular conjugate employed and the effect to be achieved, and the pharmacodynamics associated with each compound in the host.\n\n\nIn practical use, the conjugate, modulator, and LRP or LRP1B ligand according to the invention can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.\n\n\nWith respect to transdermal routes of administration, methods for transdermal administration of drugs are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th Edition, (Gennaro et al. Eds., Mack Publishing Co., 1985). Dermal or skin patches are a preferred means for transdermal delivery of the conjugates, modulators, and LRP or LRP1B ligands of the invention. Patches preferably provide an absorption enhancer such as DMSO to increase the absorption of the compounds. Other methods for transdermal drug delivery are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,962,012, 6,261,595, and 6,261,595. Each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as vehicles, adjuvants, carriers or diluents, are commercially available. Moreover, pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, stabilizers, wetting agents and the like, are commercially available.\n\n\nThose of skill will readily appreciate that dose levels can vary as a function of the specific compound, the severity of the symptoms and the susceptibility of the subject to side effects. Preferred dosages for a given compound are readily determinable by those of skill in the art by a variety of means.\n\n\nIn each of these aspects, the compositions include, but are not limited to, compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), pulmonary (nasal or buccal inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend in part on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. Exemplary routes of administration are the oral and intravenous routes. The compositions may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\nIn practical use, the compounds (e.g., LRP or LRP1B ligand conjugates, LRP or LRP1B modulator conjugates, LRP or LRP1B ligand-fusion proteins, LRP or LRP1B modulators, and LRP or LRP1B ligands) according to the invention can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media maybe employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.\n\n\nBecause of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. The percentage of an active compound in these compositions may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 percent to about 60 percent of the weight of the unit.\n\n\nThe conjugates, modulators, and ligands of the invention are useful for therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic intervention in animals, and in particular in humans. As described herein, the conjugates show preferential accumulation and/or release of the active agent in any target organ, compartment, or site depending upon the biopolymer used.\n\n\nCompositions of the present invention may be administered encapsulated in or attached to viral envelopes or vesicles, or incorporated into cells. Vesicles are micellular particles which are usually spherical and which are frequently lipidic. Liposomes are vesicles formed from a bilayer membrane. Suitable vesicles include, but are not limited to, unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar lipid vesicles or liposomes. Such vesicles and liposomes may be made from a wide range of lipid or phospholipid compounds, such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, glycolipids, gangliosides, etc. using standard techniques, such as those described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,394,448. Such vesicles or liposomes may be used to administer compounds intracellularly and to deliver compounds to the target organs. Controlled release of a p97-composition of interest may also be achieved using encapsulation (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,186,941).\n\n\nAny route of administration which dilutes the conjugates, modulators, and LRP or LRP1B ligands composition into the blood stream, or at least outside of the blood-brain barrier, may be used. Preferably, the composition is administered peripherally, most preferably intravenously or by cardiac catheter. Intra-jugular and intra-carotid injections are also useful. Compositions may be administered locally or regionally, such as intra-peritoneally. In one aspect, compositions are administered with a suitable pharmaceutical diluent or carrier.\n\n\nDosages to be administered will depend on individual needs, on the desired effect, the active agent used, the biopolymer and on the chosen route of administration. Preferred dosages of a conjugate range from about 0.2 pmol/kg to about 25 nmol/kg, and particularly preferred dosages range from 2-250 pmol/kg; alternatively, preferred doses of the conjugate may be in the range of 0.02 to 2000 mg/kg. These dosages will be influenced by the number of active agent or drug moieties associated with the biopolymer. Alternatively, dosages may be calculated based on the active agent administered.\n\n\nIn preferred embodiment the conjugate comprises p97. For instance, doses of p97-adriamycin comprising from 0.005 to 100 mg/kg of adriamycin are also useful in vivo. Particularly preferred is a dosage of p97-adriamycin comprising from 0.05 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg of adriamycin. Those skilled in the art can determine suitable doses for other compounds linked to p97 based on the recommended dosage used for the free form of the compound. p97 generally reduces the amount of drug needed to obtain the same effect.\n\n\nThe p97-conjugates, modulators, and LRP1 or LRP1B ligands of the invention are useful for therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic intervention in animals, and in particular in humans. As described herein, p97-compounds show preferential accumulation in the lung, liver, kidney and spleen, and that they significantly reduce delivery of the compounds to the heart. Preferred medical indications for diagnostic uses include, for example, any condition associated with a target organ of interest (e.g., lung, liver, kidney, spleen) or any condition that requires a cardiotoxic compound that would benefit by reducing its cardiotoxicity.\n\n\nThe subject methods find use in the treatment of a variety of different disease conditions. In certain embodiments, of particular interest is the use of the subject methods in disease conditions where an active agent or drug having desired activity has been previously identified, but in which the active agent or drug is not targeted to the target site, area or compartment. With such active agents or drugs, the subject methods can be used to enhance the therapeutic efficacy and therapeutic index of active agent or drug.\n\n\nThe specific disease conditions treatable by with the subject conjugates are as varied as the types of drug moieties that can be present in the conjugate. Thus, disease conditions include cellular proliferative diseases, such as neoplastic diseases, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, hormonal abnormality diseases, degenerative diseases, diseases of aging, diseases of the central nervous system (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, hyperlipidemias), psychiatric diseases and conditions (e.g., schizophrenia, mood disorders such as depression and anxiety), infectious diseases, and the like.\n\n\nTreatment is meant to encompass any beneficial outcome to a subject associated with administration of a conjugate including a reduced likelihood of acquiring a disease, prevention of a disease, slowing, stopping or reversing, the progression of a disease or an amelioration of the symptoms associated with the disease condition afflicting the host, where amelioration or benefit is used in a broad sense to refer to at least a reduction in the magnitude of a parameter, e.g., symptom, associated with the pathological condition being treated, such as inflammation and pain associated therewith. As such, treatment also includes situations where the pathological condition, or at least symptoms associated therewith, are completely inhibited, e.g., prevented from happening, or stopped, e.g., terminated, such that the host no longer suffers from the pathological condition, or at least the symptoms that characterize the pathological condition.\n\n\nA variety of hosts or subjects are treatable according to the subject methods. Generally such hosts are “mammals” or “mammalian,” where these terms are used broadly to describe organisms which are within the class mammalia, including the orders carnivore (e.g., dogs and cats), rodentia (e.g., mice, guinea pigs, and rats), and primates (e.g., humans, chimpanzees, and monkeys). In many embodiments, the hosts will be humans.\n\n\nP. Combinatorial Chemical Libraries\n\n\nRecently, attention has focused on the use of combinatorial chemical libraries to assist in the generation of new chemical compound leads. A combinatorial chemical library is a collection of diverse chemical compounds generated by either chemical synthesis or biological synthesis by combining a number of chemical “building blocks” such as reagents. For example, a linear combinatorial chemical library such as a polypeptide library is formed by combining a set of chemical building blocks called amino acids in every possible way for a given compound length (i.e., the number of amino acids in a polypeptide compound). Millions of chemical compounds can be synthesized through such combinatorial mixing of chemical building blocks. For example, one commentator has observed that the systematic, combinatorial mixing of 100 interchangeable chemical building blocks results in the theoretical synthesis of 100 million tetrameric compounds or 10 billion pentameric compounds (Gallop et al. \nJ. Med. Chem. \n37(9):1233 (1994)).\n\n\nPreparation and screening of combinatorial chemical libraries are well known to those of skill in the art. Such combinatorial chemical libraries include, but are not limited to, benzodiazepines (U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,514), diversomers such as hydantoins, benzodiazepines and dipeptides (Hobbs et al. \nPNAS USA \n90: 6909 (1993)), analogous organic syntheses of small compound libraries (Chen et al.) \nJ. Amer. Chem. Soc. \n116: 2661 (1994), oligocarbamates (Cho, et al., \nScience \n261: 1303 (1993)), and/or peptidyl phosphonates (Campbell et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n59: 658 (1994)), and small organic molecule libraries (see, e.g., benzodiazepines (Baum \nC\n&\nEN\n, January 18, page 33 (1993)), thiazolidinones and metathiazanones (U.S. Pat. No. 5,549,974), pyrrolidines (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,525,735 and 5,519,134), benzodiazepines (U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,514), and the like.\n\n\nDevices for the preparation of combinatorial libraries are commercially available (see, e.g., 357 MPS, 390 MPS, Advanced Chem Tech, Louisville Ky., Symphony, Rainin, Woburn, Mass., 433A Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., 9050 Plus, Millipore, Bedford, Mass.).\n\n\nA number of well known robotic systems have also been developed for solution phase chemistries. These systems include automated workstations like the automated synthesis apparatus developed by Takeda Chemical Industries, LTD. (Osaka, Japan) and many robotic systems utilizing robotic arms (Zymate II, Zymark Corporation, Hopkinton, Mass.; Orca, HewlettPackard, Palo Alto, Calif.) which mimic the manual synthetic operations performed by a chemist. Any of the above devices are suitable for use with the present invention. The nature and implementation of modifications to these devices so that they can operate as discussed herein will be apparent to persons skilled in the relevant art. In addition, numerous combinatorial libraries are themselves commercially available (see, e.g., ComGenex, Princeton, N.J., Asinex, Moscow, Ru, Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, Mo., ChemStar, Ltd., Moscow, RU, 3D Pharmaceuticals, Exton, Pa., Martek Biosciences, Columbia, Md., etc.).\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the combinatorial chemistry provides variants of the known native or endogenous human ligands of the LRP and LRP1B receptors as candidate ligands, modulators, and conjugates for use according to the invention.\n\n\nQ. High Throughput Assays of Chemical Libraries\n\n\nThe assays for compounds described herein are amenable to high throughput screening. Preferred assays thus detect activation of transcription (i.e., activation of mRNA production) by the test compound(s), activation of protein expression by the test compound(s), or binding to the gene product (e.g., expressed protein) by the test compound(s). The BiaCore method is one such means for rapidly screening compounds for binding activity.\n\n\nHigh throughput assays for the presence, absence, or quantification of particular protein products or binding assays are well known to those of skill in the art. Thus, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,559,410 discloses high throughput screening methods for proteins, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,576,220 and 5,541,061 disclose high throughput methods of screening for ligand/antibody binding.\n\n\nIn addition, high throughput screening systems are commercially available (see, e.g., Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, Mass.; Air Technical Industries, Mentor, Ohio; Beckman Instruments, Inc. Fullerton, Calif. Precision Systems, Inc., Natick, Mass., etc.). These systems typically automate entire procedures including all sample and reagent pipetting, liquid dispensing, timed incubations, and final readings of the microplate in detector(s) appropriate for the assay. These configurable systems provide high throughput and rapid start up as well as a high degree of flexibility and customization. The manufacturers of such systems provide detailed protocols the various high throughput. Thus, for example, Zymark Corp. provides technical bulletins describing screening systems for detecting the modulation of gene transcription, ligand binding, and the like.\n\n\nR. Conjugation and Labeling\n\n\nOne of ordinary skill in the art would know how to conjugate and active agent to a protein or peptide. Methods of conjugating active agents and labels to proteins are well known in the art. See, for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,981,194. Many reagents and cross linkers can be used to prepare bioconjugates of an active agent and a biopolymer. See, for instance, Hermanson, G T et al. \nBioconjugate Techniques\n, Academic Press, (1996).\n\n\nProduction of Chimeric Proteins\n\n\nThe chimeric protein of the present invention can be produced using host cells expressing a single nucleic acid encoding the entire chimeric protein or more than one nucleic acid sequence, each encoding a domain of the chimeric protein and, optionally, an amino acid or amino acids which will serve to link the domains. The chimeric proteins can also be produced by chemical synthesis.\n\n\nA. Host Cells\n\n\nHost cells used to produce chimeric proteins are bacterial, yeast, insect, non-mammalian vertebrate, or mammalian cells; the mammalian cells include, but are not limited to, hamster, monkey, chimpanzee, dog, cat, bovine, porcine, mouse, rat, rabbit, sheep and human cells. The host cells can be immortalized cells (a cell line) or non-immortalized (primary or secondary) cells and can be any of a wide variety of cell types, such as, but not limited to, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, epithelial cells (e.g., mammary epithelial cells, intestinal epithelial cells), ovary cells (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary or CHO cells), endothelial cells, glial cells, neural cells, formed elements of the blood (e.g., lymphocytes, bone marrow cells), muscle cells, hepatocytes and precursors of these somatic cell types.\n\n\nCells which contain and express DNA or RNA encoding the chimeric protein are referred to herein as genetically modified cells. Mammalian cells which contain and express DNA or RNA encoding the chimeric protein are referred to as genetically modified mammalian cells. Introduction of the DNA or RNA into cells is by a known transfection method, such as electroporation, microinjection, microprojectile bombardment, calcium phosphate precipitation, modified calcium phosphate precipitation, cationic lipid treatment, photoporation, fusion methodologies, receptor mediated transfer, or polybrene precipitation. Alternatively, the DNA or RNA can be introduced by infection with a viral vector. Methods of producing cells, including mammalian cells, which express DNA or RNA encoding a chimeric protein are described in co-pending patent applications U.S. Ser. No. 08/334,797, entitled “In Vivo Protein Production and Delivery System for Gene Therapy”, by Richard F Selden, Douglas A. Treco and Michael W. Heartlein (filed Nov. 4, 1994); U.S. Ser. No. 08/334,455, entitled “In Vivo Production and Delivery of Erythropoietin or Insulinotropin for Gene Therapy”, by Richard F Selden, Douglas A. Treco and Michael W. Heartlein (filed Nov. 4, 1994) and U.S. Ser. No. 08/231,439, entitled “Targeted Introduction of DNA Into Primary or Secondary Cells and Their Use for Gene Therapy”, by Douglas A. Treco, Michael W. Heartlein and Richard F Selden (filed Apr. 20, 1994). The teachings of each of these applications are expressly incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nB. Nucleic Acid Constructs\n\n\nA nucleic acid construct used to express the chimeric protein can be one which is expressed extrachromosomally (episomally) in the transfected mammalian cell or one which integrates, either randomly or at a pre-selected targeted site through homologous recombination, into the recipient cell's genome. A construct which is expressed extrachromosomally comprises, in addition to chimeric protein-encoding sequences, sequences sufficient for expression of the protein in the cells and, optionally, for replication of the construct. It typically includes a promoter, chimeric protein-encoding DNA and a polyadenylation site. The DNA encoding the chimeric protein is positioned in the construct in such a manner that its expression is under the control of the promoter. Optionally, the construct may contain additional components such as one or more of the following: a splice site, an enhancer sequence, a selectable marker gene under the control of an appropriate promoter, and an amplifiable marker gene under the control of an appropriate promoter.\n\n\nIn those embodiments in which the DNA construct integrates into the cell's genome, it need include only the chimeric protein-encoding nucleic acid sequences. Optionally, it can include a promoter and an enhancer sequence, a polyadenylation site or sites, a splice site or sites, nucleic acid sequences which encode a selectable marker or markers, nucleic acid sequences which encode an amplifiable marker and/or DNA homologous to genomic DNA in the recipient cell to target integration of the DNA to a selected site in the genome (targeting DNA or DNA sequences).\n\n\nC. Cell Culture Methods\n\n\nMammalian cells containing the chimeric protein-encoding DNA or RNA are cultured under conditions appropriate for growth of the cells and expression of the DNA or RNA. Those cells which express the chimeric protein can be identified, using known methods and methods described herein, and the chimeric protein isolated and purified, using known methods and methods also described herein; either with or without amplification of chimeric protein production. Identification can be carried out, for example, through screening genetically modified mammalian cells displaying a phenotype indicative of the presence of DNA or RNA encoding the chimeric protein, such as PCR screening, screening by Southern blot analysis, or screening for the expression of the chimeric protein. Selection of cells having incorporated chimeric protein-encoding DNA may be accomplished by including a selectable marker in the DNA construct and culturing transfected or infected cells containing a selectable marker gene under conditions appropriate for survival of only those cells which express the selectable marker gene. Further amplification of the introduced DNA construct can be effected by culturing genetically modified mammalian cells under conditions appropriate for amplification (e.g., culturing genetically modified mammalian cells containing an amplifiable marker gene in the presence of a concentration of a drug at which only cells containing multiple copies of the amplifiable marker gene can survive).\n\n\nGenetically modified mammalian cells expressing the chimeric protein can be identified, as described herein, by detection of the expression product. For example, mammalian cells expressing chimeric protein in which the carrier is p97 can be identified by a sandwich enzyme immunoassay. The antibodies can be directed toward the LRP portion or the active agent portion.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe examples provide exemplary protocols for assessing transcytosis in vitro and for characterizing the interaction of p97 and MTf-R receptor modulators or ligands with the p97 receptor or the blood-brain barrier:\n\n\nExample I\n\n\nIn Vitro Model of the Blood-Brain Barrier\n\n\n \nFIG. 44\n shows a schematic of an in vitro model of the blood brain barrier.\n\n\nA. Astrocytes. Primary cultures of mixed astrocytes were prepared from newborn rat cerebral cortex (Dehouck, et al., \nJournal of Controlled Release \n(1992)). Briefly, after removing the meninges, the brain tissue was forced gently through a 82 μm nylon sieve. Astrocytes were plated on six-well microplates at a concentration of 1.2×10\n5 \ncells/ml in 2 ml of optimal culture medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal heat inactivated calf serum. The medium was changed twice a week.\n\n\nB. BBCEC. Bovine brain capillary endothelial cells (BBCECs) were obtained from Cellial Technologies. The cells were cultured in the presence of DMEM medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) horse and 10% heat-inactivated calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 1 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor, added every other day.\n\n\nC. BBB. The in vitro model of BBB was established by using a co-culture of BBCECs and astrocytes, basically as described in Dehouck, et al., \nEur. J. Pharm. Sci., \n3:357-365 (1995); and Cecchelli, et al., \nAdv. Drug Deliv. Rev., \n36:165-178 (1999)). In this model, the luminal side corresponds to the apical or serum facing side of the blood-brain barrier. The abluminal side corresponds to the basolateral side of the BBB, i.e., the side facing the neurons. It is noted that this terminology is used throughout the specification. Prior to cell culture, plate inserts (Millicell-PC 3.0 μM; 30-mm diameter) were coated on the upper side with rat tail collagen. They were then set in the six-multiwell microplates containing the astrocytes prepared as described above, and BBCECs were plated on the upper side of the filters in 2 ml of co-culture medium. This BBCEC medium was changed three times a week. Under these conditions, differentiated BBCECs formed a \nconfluent monolayer\n 7 days later. Experiments were performed between 5 and 7 days after confluence was reached. The number of cells at confluence was 400 000 cells/4.2 cm\n2 \nor 90 μg of protein/4.2 cm\n2\n, as evaluated by a micro-BCA assay from Pierce (Rockford, Ill.).\n\n\nD. Sucrose permeability. The permeability coefficient for sucrose was measured to verify the endothelial permeability and the integrity and tightness of the BBCEC monolayers, as previously described, using uncoated filters or coated with endothelial cells. Briefly, the results were plotted as the clearance of [\n14\nC]-sucrose (μl) as a function of time (min). The permeability coefficient (Pe) was calculated as: 1/Pe=(1/PSt-1/PSf)/filter area (4.2 cm\n2\n), where PSt is the permeability×surface area of a filter of the co-culture; PSf is the permeability of a filter coated with collagen and with astrocytes plated on the bottom side of the filter.\n\n\nBrain EC monolayers grown on inserts were transferred to 6-well plates containing 2 ml of Ringer/Hepes per well (basolateral compartment). Ringer/Hepes solution was composed of 150 mM NaCl, 5.2 mM KCl, 2.2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 6 mM NaHCO\n3\n, 5 mM Hepes, 2.8 mM Hepes, pH 7.4. In each apical chamber, the culture medium was replaced by Ringer/Hepes containing the labeled [\n14\nC]-sucrose. At different times, inserts were placed into another well. At the end of the experiments, amounts of the radiotracers in the basolateral compartment were measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The permeability coefficient (Pe) for sucrose was calculated as previously described (Dehouck, et al., \nJ. Neurochem., \n58:1790-1797 (1992)) using filters coated or noncoated with EC. At the end of the experiments, amounts of the radiotracers in the basolateral compartment were measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The results were plotted as the clearance of [\n14\nC]-sucrose (μl) as a function of time (min). PSt=permeability×surface area of a filter of the coculture; PSf=permeability of a filter coated with collagen and astrocytes plated on the bottom side of the filter. The permeability coefficient (Pe) was calculated as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nClearance\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nμ\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nC\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nC\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nC\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nAbluminal\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ntracer\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nconcentration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nA\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolume\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nof\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nabluminal\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchamber\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\nC\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\nL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\nLuminal\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\ntracer\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\nconcentration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n/\n\n\nPe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n/\n\n\nPSt\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n/\n\n\nPSf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n/\n\n\nfilter\n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\narea\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n⁢\n\n\n\n\ncm\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n and \nFIG. 2\n set out control experiments.\n\n\n[Briefly, in \nFIG. 1\n, coated or non-coated filters with BBCE cells were transferred to 6-well plates containing 2 ml of Ringer/Hepes per well (basolateral compartment) for 2 hrs at 37° C. In each apical chamber, the culture medium was replaced by 1 ml Ringer-Hepes containing labeled [\n14\nC]-sucrose. At different times, inserts were placed into another well. At the end of the experiments, amounts of the radiotracers in the basolateral compartment were measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The difference in the slopes for PSf and PSt demonstrates that the monolayer of cells provides significant resistance to sucrose permeability, thus confirming the presence of tight junctions between cells regardless of pre-incubation.\n\n\nIn \nFIG. 2\n, 1 micromolar p97 protein (provided by Synapse Technologies Inc, Vancouver, Canada) was added to the luminal side to determine its effect on sucrose permeability. Sucrose permeability in the absence of p97 was 1.21×10-3 cm/min, whereas in the presence of p97 sucrose permeability was 1.35×10-3 cm/min. The results show that there was no significant change in sucrose permeability. A control experiment in the absence of cells demonstrates the relative effectiveness of the BBB model compared to the filter alone.\n\n\nIn \nFIGS. 1 and 2\n, Psf and Pst refer to flow rates through the membrane with and without cells. They are used to calculate the permeability of the membrane with cells. Definitions for Psf and Pst are in found in \nJ. Neurochem., \n58:1790-97 (1992), the teachings of which are incorporated by reference. The definition of PSt and PSf are simply the slope of the clearance curves for the co-culture and for the control filter respectively. The PS value for the endothelial monolayer alone is defined as PSe where:\n\n\n1/\nPSe=\n1/\n \nPSt−\n \n1/\nPSf \n\n\n\nPermeability of the endothelial monolayer alone is defined as Pe where:\n\n\n\nPe=PSe/A, \n\n\n\nwherein A is the area of the membrane.\n\n\n\nExample II\n\n\nBinding of p97 with BBCECs and Rat Brain Endothelial Cells\n\n\nB. Binding studies of p97. Binding of p97 was performed with BBCECs and Rat Brain Endothelial Cells that were pre-incubated 2 hrs in Ringer/Hepes to avoid any interference from the astrocytes.\n\n\n \nFIG. 3\n demonstrates the competitive binding of p97 with cold p97, transferrin and lactoferrin. For the binding experiments, cells were incubated for 2 h at 4° C. in Ringer/Hepes in the presence of [\n125\nI]-p97 (25 nM) and increasing concentrations of cold-p97 or high (7.5 micromolar) concentrations of transferrin or lactoferrin. At the end of the incubation, the filters were gently washed at 4° C. three times with 4 ml of cold-PBS. Then the associated radioactivity of endothelial cells was determined by removing the membrane of the culture insert and counting it in a gamma counter.\n\n\nThe results of \nFIG. 3\n demonstrate that [\n125\nI]-p97 binding to the BBCECs was competitively inhibited by cold-p97 and by lactoferrin, but significantly, transferrin did not block or reduce the binding of [\n125\nI]-p97 to its receptor on the BBCECs. This data establishes for the first time that [\n125\nI]-p97 is not binding to the transferrin receptor (Tf-R) as previously hypothesized.\n\n\nC. Binding of p97 in Rat Brain Endothelial Cells\n\n\nAs with \nFIG. 3\n, \nFIG. 4\n demonstrates a comparative study, but this time using Rat Brain Endothelial-4 cells (RBE4 supplied commercially by ATCC). RBE4 cells were grown in monolayers in 24 wells plastic tissue culture flasks at 37° C. under 5% CO2 in minimum essential medium Alpha and Ham's F10 (1:1) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum. For p97 binding experiments, RBE4 cells were pre-incubated at 37° C. for 2 hrs in Ringer/Hepes. \n125\nI-p97 in 200 μl of Ringer/Hepes was added to RBE4 cells for 2 hrs at 4° C. in the presence or absence of high concentration of cold-p97, human holo-transferrin or human lactoferrin. After the incubation, the cells were washed 4 times with PBS and the \n125\nI-p97 associated with the cells was measured.\n\n\n \nFIG. 4\n demonstrates that cold p97 (10 micromolar) and lactoferrin (10 micromolar) both competitively inhibit [\n125\nI]-p97 binding to RBE4 cells, whereas transferrin (10 micromolar) does not.\n\n\nExample III\n\n\nInteraction of p97 with Human Brain Capillaries\n\n\nA. Isolation of human brain capillaries. Capillaries of the blood-brain barrier were isolated from human brain cortex by a procedure previously described by Dallaire, et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n267:22323-22327 (1992) with slight modifications. Human brains were obtained post-mortem. The brain was cleared of meninges, superficial large blood vessels and choroid plexus. All the following procedures were performed at 4° C. The cerebral cortex was homogenized in 5 volumes of Ringer/Hepes solution with a Polytron (Brinkman Instruments, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada). The homogenate was mixed with an equal volume of Dextran T-70 (27 g in 100 ml of Ringer/Hepes). The suspension was centrifuged at 25,000 g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of Ringer/Hepes and passed through a 250 μm nylon mesh screen. The nylon mesh was rinsed and the filtrate was concentrated by centrifugation at 25,000 g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of cold-Ringer/Hepes and passed through a 2.5 cm×4.0 cm glass beads column [40/60-mesh (0.25 mm) glass beads]. The columns were washed twice with 25 ml of Ringer/Hepes. The glass beads were transferred to a beaker and swirled vigorously (15 min at 4° C.) in Ringer/Hepes to separate the microvessels from the beads. The beads were allowed to settle and the supernatant was decanted and kept at 4° C. The beads were swirled for another 15 min in Ringer/Hepes. The supernatants were pooled and the microvessels were collected by centrifugation at 25,000 g for 10 min. Brain capillaries were kept at −80° C. until used.\n\n\nB. p97 accumulation in human brain capillaries. A rapid filtration technique was used to measure the accumulation of [\n125\nI]-p97 in human brain capillaries. Accumulation of [\n125\nI]-p97 was measured at 37° C. for 1 h in isolated human brain capillaries (100 μg/assay). The incubation medium contained [\n125\nI]-p97 and a final concentration of 100 nM p97 in Ringer/Hepes solution. The accumulation of [\n125\nI]-p97 was performed in presence or in absence of 5 μM of cold-p97, holo-transferrin or lactoferrin. After incubation, the accumulation was stopped by addition of 1 ml-cold stop solution (150 mM KCl, 0.1% BSA and 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.5). The suspension was filtered under vacuum through a 0.45 μM pore size Millipore filter. The filter was rinsed with 8 ml of stop solution, and the radioactivity was counted. Nonspecific binding of the radioactivity to the capillaries was determined by the addition of the ice-cold stop solution to the capillaries before adding the incubation medium. This value was subtracted from accumulation values obtained following an 1 h incubation. The results were expressed as ng of [\n125\nI]-p97 accumulated per μg of brain capillaries.\n\n\n \nFIG. 5\n demonstrates the results of the experiments. Consistent with the findings in \nFIGS. 3 and 4\n, it is found that cold p97 (5 micromolar) or lactoferrin (5 micromolar) significantly inhibits competitive [\n125\nI]-p97 binding to human brain capillary cells, whereas transferrin (5 micromolar) shows no significant competition. This finding confirms that p97 binding to its receptor is not blocked by transferrin.\n\n\n \nFIG. 6\n is a repeat experiment, performed identically to the experiment of \nFIG. 5\n, except this time with the additional competition assay for β-amyloid peptide. Evidently, the β-amyloid peptide 1-40 competes with p97 for receptor binding, along with lactoferrin, but not with transferrin. This finding indicates that the receptor responsible for the p97 binding and transport across the BBB is RAGE and/or LRP1.\n\n\n \nFIG. 7\n shows the results of experiments where the ligands p97, Lf and Tf were heated or not heated prior to the binding study. In all cases, binding experiments were conducted in the transwell apparatus as described previously, with the exception that binding was conducted at either 4° C. or at 37° C. For the 37° C. trial, a separate experiment was conducted where the ligand was boiled for 30 mins then rapidly cooled prior to administration on the transwell plates. Results demonstrate that the heat denatured p97 protein had a significantly lower accumulation in the cell monolayer compared to normal p97; although both forms at 37° C. bound to a higher degree than at 4° C. Similarly, heat denatured Lf had significantly lower accumulation in the BBB model cells than its natural counterpart. Transferrin itself had very little accumulation to speak of.\n\n\nIn \nFIG. 7\n, it is important to clarify the overall striking difference in accumulation of Lf and p97, as Lf is almost twice as high at the end of the experiment. It must be remembered that p97 is being substantially transcytosed through the BBB model cells and secreted into the abluminal region, whereas Lf is not. This effect leads to the incorrect conclusion that Lf may be taken into the BBB at a higher rate than p97.\n\n\nExample IV\n\n\nTranscytosis of p97\n\n\n \nFIG. 45\n shows a general scheme for performing transport assays in the BBCEC.\n\n\nTranscytosis experiments were performed as follows. One insert covered with BBCECs was set into a transwell apparatus containing a six-well microplate with 2 ml of Ringer/Hepes and pre-incubated for 2 h at 37° C. Plates were slowly adjusted to the indicated temperatures (4° C. or 37° C.). [\n125\nI]-p97 (250 nM) was added to the upper side of the filter covered with cells. At various times, the insert was transferred to another well to avoid a possible reendocytosis of p97 by the abluminal side of the BBCECs. At the end of experiment, [\n125\nI]-p97 was assessed in 500 μl of the lower chamber of well by TCA precipitation. p97 was also measured in 50 μl of the lower chamber of the well by Western blots using mAb L235.\n\n\n \nFIG. 8\n demonstrates that p97 transcytosis was significantly higher at 37° C. than at 4° C. This result demonstrates that p97 is actively transported in an energy dependent process across this blood-brain barrier model in a temperature dependent fashion, presumably by receptor mediated uptake.\n\n\n \nFIG. 9\n confirms that transcytosis of p97 is also a saturable phenomenon, thus further implicating a specific MTf-receptor protein in this model of the blood-brain barrier. These experiments were conducted as previously described. Measurements of the amount of transcytosis were made at the time points indicated.\n\n\nThe effect of potentially competitive ligands on transcytosis was assessed in a series of experiments. In \nFIG. 10\n \na\n, transcytosis of \n125\nI-p97 was compared in the presence of cold p97 (5 micromolar), Lf (5 micromolar), and Tf (5 micromolar). At these concentrations, only the cold p97 successfully reduced transcytosis of the labelled p97. In \nFIG. 10\n \nb\n, β-amyloid protein (5 micromolar) also failed to slow or reduce transcytosis of labelled p97. Higher amounts of ligands do interfere with p97 transcytosis (data not shown). In \nFIG. 10\n \nc\n, RAP, a known polypeptide inhibitor of the LDL-Receptor family was applied to the cells (25 micrograms/ml). RAP significantly inhibited the transcytosis of p97, thus directly implicating the LDL-receptor family, especially LRP1 as the MTf-R.\n\n\nExample V\n\n\nAccumulation and Transcytosis of p97 in Brain\n\n\nA. Brain uptake and in situ brain perfusion. To measure the brain uptake of [\n125\nI]-p97, mice were each given approximately 4 pmol of [\n125\nI]-p97, [\n125\nI]-BSA or human [\n125\nI]-holo-transferrin in 200 μl of injection solution through the jugular vein. After 1 hour, animals were sacrificed and perfused with buffer via cardiac aorta. The serum and brain samples were collected and the levels of radioactivity were measured. In situ brain perfusion was performed as previously described (Dagenais, C., Rousselle, C., Pollack, G. M. & Scherrmann, J. M. \nJ. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. \n20: 381-386 (2000)). Briefly, the right hemisphere of the brain was perfused with 10 nM of [\n125\nI]-p97 or [\n125\nI]-holotransferrin in Krebs-bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4 with 95\n \n% O\n \n 2 and 5\n% CO\n 2 at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min for 10 min) via a catheter inserted in the right common carotid artery following ligation of the external branch. Mice were decapitated to terminate perfusion and the right hemisphere was isolated on ice before subjected to capillary depletion (Triguero, D., Buciak, J. & Pardridge, W. M. \nJ Neurochem., \n54: 1882-1888 (1990)). Aliquots of homogenates, supernatants, pellets and perfusates were taken to measure their contents in [\n125\nI]-proteins by TCA precipitation and to evaluate their apparent VD.\n\n\nB. Iodination of proteins. p97, bovine holo-transferrin and bovine lactoferrin were iodinated with standard procedures using iodo-beads from Sigma. Bovine holo-transferrin and bovine lactoferrin were diluted in 0.1M phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 (PB). p97 obtained from Synapse Technologies in neutralized citrate at pH 7.0 was dialyzed against this PB. Two iodo-beads were used for each protein. These beads were washed twice with 3 ml of PB on a Whatman filter and resuspended in 60 μl of PB. \n125\nI (1 mCi) from Amersham-Pharmacia biotech was added to the bead suspension for 5 min at room temperature. The iodination for each protein was initiated by the addition of 100 μg (80-100 μl). After an incubation of 10 min at room temperature. The supernatants were applied on a desalting column prepacked with 5 ml of cross-linked dextran from Pierce and \n125\nI-proteins were eluted with 10 ml of PBS. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected, and the radioactivity in 5 μl of each fraction was measured. Fractions corresponding to \n125\nI-proteins were pooled and dialyzed against Ringer/Hepes, pH 7.4. The efficiency of radiolabeling was between 0.6-1×108 cpm/100 μg of protein.\n\n\nTranscytosis and binding experiments. One insert covered with BBCECs was set into a six-well microplate with 2 ml of Ringer-Hepes and was pre-incubated for 2 h at 37° C. [\n125\nI]-p97 was then added to the upper side of the insert. At various times, the insert was sequentially transferred into a fresh well to avoid possible reendocytosis of p97 by the abluminal side of the BBCECs. At the end of the experiment, [\n125\nI]-p97 was quantitated in 500 μl of the lower chamber of each well by TCA precipitation. We also measured p97 in 50 μl of the lower chamber of each well by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (Laemmli, U.K. \nNature; \n227: 680-685 (1970)). Proteins were separated on 7.5% acrylamide gels, stained with Coomassie Blue, dried and analysed by densitometry. For the binding experiments, cells were treated with or without saponin (0.5% wt/vol) to permeabilize cellular membranes as previously described (Descamps, L., Dehouck, M. P., Torpier, G. & Cecchelli, R. \nAm. J. Physiol. \n270: H1149-H1158 (1996)). After 2 hrs at 4° C., ECs were gently washed, and the [\n125\nI]-p97 attached to the ECs was quantified in a liquid scintillation counter.\n\n\np97 accumulation in human brain capillaries. Human brain capillaries were isolated by a procedure previously described (see Dallaire, L., Tremblay, L. & Beliveau, R. \nBiochem. J. \n276: 745-752 (1991), Demeule, M. et al. \nInt. J. Cancer. \n93: 62-66 (2001)). [\n125\nI]-p97 was incubated with capillaries (100 μg) in Ringer/Hepes solution in the presence or absence of unlabelled p97, holo-transferrin or lactoferrin. The uptake was stopped by the addition of ice-cold stop solution (150 mM KCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.5) and the suspension was filtered under vacuum through a 0.45 μM pore size Millipore filter. The filter was rinsed with 8 ml of stop solution, and the radioactivity was assayed. Nonspecific binding of radioactivity to the capillaries was determined by addition of the ice-cold stop solution to the capillaries before adding the incubation medium. This value was subtracted from the values obtained following a 1 h incubation.\n\n\nExample VI\n\n\nExemplary Methods\n\n\nCell culture. Cells were grown in monolayer at 37° C. under 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal heat inactivated calf serum (normal astrocytes); DMEM high glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate supplemented with 10% calf serum (CTX); DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10% calf serum (RG2); RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% calf serum and 2 mM glutamine (CNS-1); Ham's F12 supplemented with 10% calf serum (C6); MEM, 1 mM sodium pyruvate supplemented with 10% calf serum (U-87, U-138).\n\n\nUptake of [\n125\nI]-p97. Cells were grown in monolayer in six-multiwell microplates at 37° C. under 5% CO2. Uptake of [\n125\nI]-p97 was measured at 37° C. for 2 h in astrocytes and astrocytomas. The incubation medium contained [\n125\nI]-p97 and a final concentration of 50 nM P97 in Ringer/Hepes solution. The uptake of [\n125\nI]-p97 was performed in presence or in absence of 5 μM cold-P97. After incubation, the cell monolayer was wash three times with cold Ringer/Hepes solution. Triton X-100 0.1% was added and the [\n125\nI]-p97 uptake was assessed in the Triton X-100 soluble fraction by TCA precipitation.\n\n\nRNA extraction. Cells in six-wells plate or in 75 cm\n2 \nplastic tissue culture flasks were grown at 37° C. under 5% CO2 with optimal culture medium to 80-90% confluence. Total cellular RNA was preserved in Trizol (Gibco BRL, Burlington, ON). The solution are frozen at −80° C. until extraction. The solution was defroze and mixed with 5:1 chloroform for 3 minutes at room temperature. The suspension was centrifugated at 12000 g at 4° C. The clear supernatant was collected then mixed with 1:1 of isopropanol for 15 minutes at room temperature. The mix was centrifugated at 12000×g for 10 min at 4° C. The pellets was washed with 70% ethanol and dried before resuspended in RNase Free H2O.\n\n\nRT-PCR. RT-PCR was performed for members of the LDL-R family: LRP, LRP1B, megalin, LDL, VLDL, LRP8, LR11, RAP, LR3, cubulin and P97. DNA (cDNA) synthesis was performed with 1 (g of total RNA using a cDNA one step synthesis kit (Invitrogen, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. (lx of reaction mix, RNA 1 (g, 0.2 (M of both primers, 1 (1 of RT/Platinum Tag mix). The cDNA generated was amplified using primers produced with MacVector 7.0 (Oxford molecular Ltd, Oxford, UK). All the subsequent assays were then performed under conditions that produced amplifications of cDNA within a linear range. RT inverse-transcription was performed at 50° C. for 30 min. PCR amplification for 35 cycles for all was performed as follows: denaturation at 94° C. for 30 s, annealing at 60° C. for 30 s and extension at 72° C. for 30 s. Finalisation stage was performed at 72° C. for 30 min. Tubes containing all the ingredients except templates were included in all runs and served as negative controls. The amplified PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel in TAE (40 mM Tris, 360 mM acetic acid, 1 mM EDTA, 12.5 fM Ethium bromide) and were visualized under ultraviolet light followed by densitometric analysis.\n\n\nWestern blot. Cell lysates (25 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked over night at 4° C. in 5% non fat dry milk in TBS (\nNaCl\n 125 mM, \nTris\n 20 mM, pH 7.5) with 0.1% Tween. Successive incubations with proper primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody were carried out for 60 min at room temperature. All incubations with antibodies were done after 3×15 minutes washes with TBS-Tween 0.1% The immunoreactive proteins were detected using the ECL system (Amersham-Pharmacia, Baie d'Urfe, Que).\n\n\nLigand-binding. Briefly, cells were incubated with [\n125\nI]-p97 in Ringer/Hepes solution, in presence or in absence of 5 μM cold-P97 for 1 h at 4° C. After incubation, the cell monolayer was washed three times with cold Ringer/Hepes solution. After the ligand binding at 4° C., cell monolayer was washed three times with cold Ringer/Hepes solution and was incubated with DSS (Disuccinimidyl suberate) or Lomant's reagent DSP (Dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate)) from Pierce. After the cross-link, cells were lysed and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Gels were fixed, dryed and exposed to Kodak films at −80° C. for about 3 weeks before developing. The cross-link was performed exactly as the manufacturer's protocol.\n\n\nBIAcore analysis. MAb L235 was covalently coupled to a CM5 sensor chip via primary amine groups using the N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)/N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) coupling agent as previously described (Johnsson, B., Lofas, S., & Lindquist, G. \nAnal. Biochem. \n198: 268-277 (1991)).\n\n\nBriefly, the carboxymethylated dextran was first activated with 50 μl of NHS/EDC (50 mM/200 mM) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The mAb L235 (5 μg) in 10 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.0 was then injected and the unreacted NHS-esters were deactivated with 35 μl of 1 M ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5. Approximately 8000 to 10000 relative units of mAb 235 were immobilized on the sensor chip surface. The Ringer/Hepes buffer was used as the eluent buffer to monitor the signal plasmon resonance (SPR). p97 diluted in the same eluent buffer was boiled for various lengths of time, cooled to room temperature and injected onto the sensor chip surface. The SPR obtained was compared to that of unboiled p97.\n\n\nThe brain uptake of human [\n125\nI]-p97 in mice, one hour after i.v. injection was evaluated and compared to that obtained for [\n125\nI]-BSA or human [\n125\nI]-transferrin (\nFIG. 11\n \na\n). The brain/serum ratio for p97, BSA and holo-transferrin is respectively 0.025, 0.002 and 0.008 indicating a higher brain accumulation for p97. To determine whether this observation is related to a greater brain penetration, we measured the apparent volume of distribution (VD) of p97 and transferrin by in situ brain perfusion in mice (\nFIG. 11\n \nb\n). After a 10 min perfusion, the apparent VD for both proteins was calculated for the whole brain homogenates as well as for brain capillaries and brain parenchyma. Under these conditions the apparent VD of transferrin in the brain parenchyma is 2.4 ml/100 g which is slightly higher than the brain VD for the vascular marker [14C]-inulin at 1.7 ml/100 g (data not shown). Importantly, the apparent VD of p97 in the brain parenchyma is 17.2 ml/100 g, 8.8-fold higher than for transferrin, indicating a greater passage through brain capillaries. To further investigate the transport of p97 across the BBB, the passage of [\n125\nI]-p97 across an in vitro model of the BBB was measured at 37° C. and at 4° C. (\nFIG. 11\n \nc\n). A dramatic reduction in the transport from the apical to the basolateral surface of BBCEC monolayers of [\n125\nI-p97 is observed at 4° C., indicating that the transcytosis of p97 requires an active mechanism.\n\n\nTranscytosis of [\n125\nI-p97 at 37° C. was measured both in the apical-to-basolateral direction and in the basolateral-to-apical direction across BBCEC monolayers to ascertain any vectorial transport of p97 (\nFIG. 11\n \nd\n). This figure demonstrates that p97 transport in the BBCEC model is highly vectorial. In this experiment, [\n125\nI-p97 (25 nM) was added to the luminal or abluminal side of the BBCECs. After 2 hours of incubation at 37° C., the amount on the opposing side of the membrane was measured. Results demonstrate that p97 transport is substantially directed from the luminal to the abluminal side, corresponding in vivo to the delivery of p97 from the blood/serum face of brain capillaries (i.e., inside the capillaries) to the neural cells of the brain. After 2 hrs, [\n125\nI-p97 transport is about 3-fold higher when measured in the apical-to-basolateral direction, indicating a substantial preferential transport of p97 towards the brain.\n\n\nLocalization and Saturability of the p97 Binding Activity.\n\n\nTo assess the presence and extent of intracellular p97 binding sites, BBCECs were treated with saponin (\nFIG. 12\n \na\n). The saponin permeabilization of ECs increased the amount of [\n125\nI]-p97 associated with BBCECs 4-fold. Moreover, the binding of [\n125\nI]-p97 after saponin treatment decreased in the presence of unlabelled p97 (\nFIG. 12\n \nb\n). A 200-fold molar excess of unlabelled p97 inhibited radiolabel binding by approximately 50%, showing that much of the interaction of p97 with ECs is saturable.\n\n\nValues for specific p97 binding were calculated by subtracting the non-specific binding of p97 measured in the presence of a high concentration of unlabelled p97 and are expressed in a Scatchard plot (\nFIG. 12\n \nc\n). Analysis of this plot is consistent with a single-binding site for p97 with a Kd of about 1 μM and 4×106 sites/cell.\n\n\nComparison of p97, transferrin and lactoferrin binding on BBCEC monolayers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKd\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(nM)\n\n\nNumber of binding sites/cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nP97 (+saponin)\n\n\n1400\n\n\n6 000 000  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTransferrin\n(+saponin)\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n35 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLactoferrin (−saponin)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nSite\n 1\n\n\n35\n\n\n35 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nSite\n 2\n\n\n1900\n\n\n900 000 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above table, p97 results from \nFIG. 12\n (Kd and number of binding sites/cells) are compared to published values for transferrin and lactoferrin (see Descamps et al., Am. J. Physiol. 270:H1149-H1158, 1996; Fillebeen et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274:7011-7017, 1999).\n\n\nEfficiency of p97 Transcytosis\n\n\nThe efficiency of p97 transcytosis was assessed by comparing the passage of both p97 and bovine holo-transferrin under identical conditions (\nFIG. 13\n \na\n). Transport of p97 from the apical to the basolateral surface of ECs is much higher than for transferrin at 37° C. (\nFIG. 13\n \na\n) Heat-denaturation reduced the passage of both p97 and holo-transferrin through the BBCEC monolayers, indicating that their transcytosis is conformation-dependent. As p97 is resistant to heat denaturation in Ringer/Hepes solution (\nFIG. 13\n \nb\n), it was necessary to determine the denaturing conditions. The conformation of the protein was assessed using the biological interaction analysis in real-time between p97 and the monoclonal antibody (mAb) L235, which recognizes a conformational epitope on p97 since no enzymatic activity has yet been defined for this protein. For this analytical approach, mAb L235 was immobilized on the surface of a sensor chip and exposed to native p97 as well as to p97 which had been boiled for 5, 10, 20 or 30 min. The surface plasmon resonance signal of native proteins, the accumulation of p97 in BBCE cells is 5.7 μg/cm2 whereas no significant accumulation is observed for bovine transferrin. These results show that the p97 transport system has much greater capacity than has the transferrin transport system.\n\n\np97 Stability and BBCEC Monolayer Integrity Following Transendothelial Transport\n\n\nTo examine p97 integrity after transcytosis at 37° C. and 4° C., 50 μl of the lower compartments of the wells were recovered after 30, 60, 80 and 120 min. Proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by gel staining (\nFIG. 14\n \na\n). Time-dependent transcytosis of recombinant p97 is observed, with no apparent degradation. Transcytosis of this protein is much higher when the experiment is performed at 37° C. than at 4° C. The low molecular weight proteins observed at 30 min are only serum proteins remaining in the assay. Furthermore, the gels were scanned and the amount of p97 that passed through the BBCEC mono layers was evaluated using known quantities of p97 (\nFIG. 14\n \nb\n). The total amount of intact p97 after transendothelial transcytosis is 35 μg/cm\n2\n, very similar to the amount shown in \nFIG. 13\n \na \nafter TCA precipitation, indicating that the iodination of p97 does not interfere with its transcytosis. Since p97 is transported much faster than is transferrin, the permeability to [\n14\nC]-sucrose was measured in the presence of a high concentration of p97 (\nFIG. 14\n \nc\n). No significant increase in the clearance of sucrose is detectable in the presence of p97. In addition, the permeability coefficient (Pe) for sucrose in the presence of p97 is 1.04±0.15×10\n−3 \ncm/min, not significantly different from the value of 1.07±0.19×10\n−3 \ncm/min measured in the absence of p97 (\nFIG. 14\n \nd\n). These data indicate that the rapid passage of p97 is unrelated to changes in the integrity of BBCEC monolayers.\n\n\nEffect of p97 and Transferrin on [\n125\nI]-p97 Transcytosis\n\n\nTo establish whether this p97 transport is saturable, and whether it involved the transferrin receptor, apical-to-basal transport of [\n125\nI]-p97 across BBCEC monolayers was measured in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of p97, bovine holo-transferrin or human holo-transferrin (\nFIG. 15\n). An excess of unlabelled p97 reduced the transport of [\n125\nI]-p97 by 69% (\nFIG. 15\n \na\n) whereas the presence of either bovine or human holo-transfenin had no impact (\nFIG. 15\n \nb\n). This indicates that p97 transcytosis is a saturable process that does not employ the transferrin receptor. This assumption is supported by the fact that mAb OX-26, which binds to the transferrin receptor, does not significantly reduce p97 transcytosis as compared to transcytosis measured in the presence of nonspecific IgGs (\nFIG. 15\n \nc\n).\n\n\nIdentification of LRP as a Potential Receptor for p97\n\n\nWe also assessed the uptake of [\n125\nI]-p97 into isolated human brain capillaries incubated for 1 h at 37° C. (\nFIG. 16\n \na\n). A 50-fold molar excess of unlabelled p97 inhibited the uptake of [\n125\nI]-p97 by 60%. Human lactoferrin caused a similar inhibition of [\n125\nI]-p97 uptake whereas human holo-transferrin had no effect. These results indicate that LRP, which binds and transports lactoferrin across BBCEC monolayers is also involved in the uptake of [\n125\nI]-p97 into brain capillaries and in the transcytosis of p97.\n\n\nTo further investigate the role of LRP in the transport of p97, transcytosis experiments were performed in the presence of the receptor-associated protein (RAP), a protein chaperone that regulates LRP (\nFIG. 16\n \nb\n). Recombinant RAP (25 μg/ml) reduced the initial rate of [\n125\nI]-p97 transport across BBCEC monolayers by more than 50%. In addition, the transcytosis of bovine [\n125\nI]-lactoferrin is inhibited by more than 75% by a 200-fold molar excess of unlabelled p97 (\nFIG. 16\n \nc\n).\n\n\n \nFIG. 17\n further illustrates the effect of LRP ligands RAP, Aprotinin and BSA on p97 transcystosis and the effect of p97 on lactoferrin transcytosis. The inhibition by RAP but not BSA distinguishes the p97 from megalin, the chylomicron receptor found in the liver, and the receptor for advanced glycation end products which can be found on lung endothelial cells, neurons, atrocytes, and glomeruli.\n\n\nTime Course of p97 Uptake in BBCE.\n\n\nThe time course for the internalization of p97 is illustrated in \nFIG. 18\n which depicts the movement of p97 at 30 minutes and 60 minutes and its accumulation in early endosome. \nFIG. 19\n illustrates the conditions for studying the rate of p97 internalization and transcytosis in the BBB model. \nFIG. 20\n shows the results of such a study. Transcytosis is fast as in 10 minutes, 80% of membrane bound p97 has transcytosed.\n\n\nPathway for p97 Endocytosis.\n\n\nUpon binding to a LRP to a growing brain capillary endothelial cell, LDL is classically internalized by a clathrin dependent pathway wherein the LDL is directed toward lysosomes and degraded so as to provide cholesterol to the growing cell. This pathway is sensitive to filipin. In differentiated BCECs, the LDL is transcytosed. Evidence indicates the same receptor is involved in both pathways. (see Dehouck et al., \nJ. of Cell Biology \n138(4) 877-889 (1997).\n\n\nThe possibility that p97 endocytosis involved a clathrin-dependent mechanism or a clathrin independent mechanism (i.e., caveolae) was examined in BBCE. p97 was found to co-localize with clathrin much more similarly than with caveolin (data not shown). Transcellular localization of p97 and clathrin was examined in BBCE as the p97 moved from the luminal to abluminal side of the BBB model (\nFIG. 21\n). The data are indicative of a co-migration of p97 and clathrin. As a control for the effect of the Alexa label, the behavior of p97 and p97-alexa were compared. (data not shown). Although p97-alexa also labeled other vesicular structures, p97 and p97-alexa had a similar localization indicating that the label did not change the behavior of p97.\n\n\nFollowing endocytosis, the transport fate of p97 depends upon the cell type. As shown in \nFIG. 22\n, p97 may be transported across the cell as occurs with brain endothelial cells lining the brain capillaries or else it may be transported to a lysosome. In the first instance, p97 is useful as a means of delivering therapeutic agents such as p97 therapeutic agent conjugates across the blood brain barrier. In the second instance, p97 is useful as a means of delivering therapeutic agents to the intracellular compartment, particularly the lysosome. In this instance, conjugates with enzymes (e.g., an enzyme deficient in a patient with a lysosomal storage disease) are particularly of interest.\n\n\nLRP Ligands and Receptor Family Expression.\n\n\n \nFIG. 23\n illustrates an LRP receptor α and β subunits with respect to the cell membrane and some LRP ligands. \nFIG. 25\n presents the relative amounts of LRP/LRP1B proteins in various cell types, including astrocytomas, normal astrocytes, and brain capillaries. As a contrast, the distribution of megalin among astrocytes and astrocytomas is presented in \nFIG. 26\n. As shown in \nFIGS. 27 and 28\n, the expression of LRP1B in astrocytes and astrocytomas as determined by (RT-PCR) is increased in the astrocytomas over the astrocytes. This result is result is consistant with the greater uptake of the labeled p97 by the astrocytomas. By way of contrast, and in confirmation that megalin is not involved in the p97 uptake, the pattern of megalin expression among these cells is not at all similar to the uptake pattern for p97 for these cells (see \nFIG. 26\n). \nFIGS. 28A-28D\n more clearly illustrates the correlation between p97 uptake and LRP1B expression.\n\n\n \nFIG. 32\n shows the expression of members of the LDL receptor family by RT-PCR. In glioblastoma cell line U87 LRP, LRP1b, LDL, and LRP8 are highly expressed. Cubilin and RAP are expressed to a much lesser extent. In human capillaries, LRP1B, megalin, LDL, LRP8, and LRP are highly expressed as compared to cubilin.\n\n\nAssociation of p97 with LRP/LRP1B\n\n\n \nFIG. 29\n shows that LRP/LRP1B migrates as a high molecular weight dissociable complex in the presence of p97, indicating the association of the two molecules. Exposing the complex to reducing conditions such as .beta.-mercaptoethanol induces the release of p97 from the high molecular weight complex (see \nFIG. 30\n). p97 similarly forms high molecular weight complexes upon contact with glioblastomas and human brain capillaries (see \nFIG. 31\n).\n\n\nEffect of p97 on Cell Expression of Members of LDL-Receptor Family in Human Glioblastoma.\n\n\nTo examine the ability of p97 to be taken up by astrocytoma cells and astrocytes, cells of each type were incubated with \n125\nI p97. As shown in \nFIG. 24\n, the specific uptake of p97 in such cells was greatly increased in the astrocytoma cells over the astrocytes. As shown in \nFIG. 24\n, astrocytoma cells take up p97 to a much greater extent than astrocytes. This finding indicates that p97 conjugates to anticancer agents would be particularly useful in the treatment of gliomas. \nFIG. 34\n shows the effect of p97 and RAP treatments on LRP and LRP1B expression in U87 cells. While p97 does induce the expression of LRP1B, it has no discernable effect on the morphology of the U-87 cells (see \nFIG. 33\n). \nFIG. 35\n, shows the dose response effect of p97 for LRP1Bb, LRP, LDL-R, Megalin, and Cubilin as measured by RT-PR in U-87 cells. p97 induces the expression of the LRP1B receptor and the Cubilin receptor, but not the LRP or Megalin receptor. RAP appears to antagonize the effect of p97 on those receptors. p97 also appears to induce its own expression as shown by RT-PCR methods (see \nFIG. 36\n). \nFIGS. 37 and 38\n summarize the quantitated effects of p97 and RAP on the expression of LRP1B, LRP, LDL-R (\nFIGS. 37A-37C\n, respectively), Cubilin, p97, and Megalin (\nFIGS. 38A-38C\n, respectively) in the glioblastoma U87 cell line as determined by RT-PCR.\n\n\nEffect of p97 on Fibroblast Cells.\n\n\nThe fibroblast cell line MG1391 was used to assess the potential of p97 and other LRP ligand conjugates as carriers for transcytosis or endocytosis in fibroblasts. \nFIG. 39\n shows the expression of members of the LDL receptor family in MG1391 cells. LRP, LDL, and to a lesser extent, LRP1B and Cubilin are expressed as measured by RT-PCR. Further more, p97 particularly induces the expression of the LRP1B as shown in \nFIGS. 40 and 41\n.\n\n\nExpression of LDL Receptor Family Members in Human Endothelial Cells and BBCE Cells.\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 42\n, LRP, LRP1B, and LDL-R as well as LRP8 are highly expressed in human endothelial cells. The expression of LDL receptor family members in the absence of astrocytes in largely that of LRP5. However, the presence of astrocytes induces the expression of LRP1B and LRP8 in the BBCE cells (see \nFIG. 43\n).\n\n\nThe above examples show that the brain p97 uptake, in vivo, is much higher than that of other proteins such as BSA and transferrin. The in vitro model of the BBB used here to characterize the transcytosis of p97 has been used previously for such proteins as transferrin, lactoferrin, low density lipoproteins and insulin (see Dehouck, B. et al. \nJ. Cell. Biol. \n138: 877-889 (1997), Fillebeen, C. et al. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n274: 7011-7017 (1999); Descamps, L., Dehouck, M. P., Torpier, G. & Cecchelli, R. \nAm. J. Physiol. \n270: H1149-H1158 (1996)); Frank, H. J., Pardridge, W. M., Morris, W. L., Rosenfeld, R. G. & Choi, T. B. \nDiabetes \n35: 654-661 (1986)). As was seen with these proteins, transendothelial transport of p97 requires energy and is concentration-dependent, indicating a receptor-mediated endocytosis mechanism for p97. In addition, preferential transport of p97 from the apical to the basolateral surface of BBCECs is observed with no detectable degradation of p97. The conformation of p97 also seems to be very important for its transcytosis because heat-denaturation considerably reduced the transendothelial transport of this protein. Thus, the in vitro results strongly confirm and support the in vivo observations on high p97 uptake in the brain.\n\n\nThe results show the presence of a low affinity receptor for p97 with a high capacity. Since all the experiments comparing bovine transferrin with human p97 are performed in a heterologous system, we can expect that the binding constant for the p97 receptor would be even greater in a human homologous system. It has been postulated that p97 is an alternate ligand for the transferrin receptor because p97 shares many properties with human transferrin and because the transferrin receptor has been detected in the same tissues as p97. However, our results strongly support that a different mechanism than that involving the transferrin receptor. First, the transcytosis, binding and accumulation of p97 are much higher than those for transferrin indicating that the p97 receptor has a much higher capacity and lower affinity than those previously reported for the transferrin receptor. Second, the transcytosis of p97 is unaffected by either bovine or human transferrin, indicating that p97 does not compete with transferrin for its receptor. Third, the mAb OX-26 directed against the transferrin receptor, which was previously shown to inhibit the uptake of transferrin, has no effect on p97 transport. In addition to the transcytosis experiments using BBCEC monolayers, the competition of [\n125\nI]-p97 uptake by unlabelled p97 in isolated human brain capillaries confirmed the presence of a receptor for p97. Moreover, lactoferrin competed [\n125\nI]-p97 uptake efficiently, better than transferrin or any other tested proteins, indicating that lactoferrin and p97 share a receptor. The receptor for lactoferrin transcytosis in brain ECs is LRP 6, a member of the large LDL-receptor family. (see Bu, G. & Rennke, S. J. Biol. Chem. 271: 22218-2224 (1996)). To further investigate whether LRP could be involved in p97 transcytosis, experiments were performed with BBCEC monolayers in the presence of RAP, a protein which inhibits the binding of ligand to members of the LDL-receptor family (see Bu, G. & Rennke, S. J. Biol. Chem. 271: 22218-2224 (1996); Willnow, T. E, Goldstein, J. L., Orth, K., Brown, M. S. & Herz, J. J. Biol. Chem. 267: 26172-26180 (1992); Bu, G. & Schwartz, A. L. Trends Cell Biol. 8: 272-276 (1998); and Herz, J. & Strickland, D. K. J. Clin. Invest. 108: 779-784 (2001).\n\n\nKnown members of this family also include LDL-R, LRP1B, megalin, VLDL-R, apoE-\nreceptor\n 2 and the mosaic LDLR-related protein (LR11) (see Hussain, M. M. \nFront. Biosci. \n6: D417-D428 (2001); and Liu, C. X., Li, Y., Obermoeller-McCormick, L. M., Schwartz, A. L. & Bu, G. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276: 28889-28896 (2001)). Among these receptors, megalin, is also known to bind lactoferrin (see Hussain, M. M. Front. \nBiosci. \n6: D417-D428 (2001); and Willnow T E. \nBiol. Chem. \n379: 1025-1031 (1998)). However, megalin is mainly expressed in the kidney whereas the major site of LRP expression is in brain. Thus, the diminution of p97 transcytosis by RAP and the inhibition of lactoferrin transcytosis by p97 also indicates that LRP transports p97 across BBCECs.\n\n\nThe concept of using receptor-mediated endocytosis to deliver peptides into the brain was initially described with the findings on the transendothelial transport of insulin across the blood brain barrier (BBB). Subsequent studies demonstrated that a neuropeptide could be delivered into the CNS using receptor-mediated endocytosis by targeting the transferrin receptor with the mAb OX-26 (see Bickel, U., Yoshikawa, T. & Pardridge, W. M. \nAdv. Drug Deliv. Rev. \n46: 247-279 (2001) and Pardridge, W. M., Buciak, J. L. & Friden, P. M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 259: 66-70 (1991)). The development of chimeric proteins containing this mAb, specific linkers and a neurotropic peptide has permitted delivery into the brain of significant levels of this peptide (see Bickel, U., Yoshikawa, T. & Pardridge, W. M. \nAdv. Drug Deliv. Rev. \n46: 247-279 (2001); Pardridge, W. M., Wu, D., & Sakane, T. Pharm. Res. 15: 576-582 (1998); and Zhang, Y. & Pardridge, W. M. Brain Res. 889:49-56 (2001)). In addition, the transendothelial transport of mAb OX-26 was also reported in these studies to be similar to the transport of human transferrin across the BBB. Our results show that p97 passes across the blood brain barrier (BBB) at least as well as does OX-26. Another advantage of using p97 is its very low concentration in the serum (100 000-fold lower than transferrin) (see Jefferies, W. A. et al. \nBrain Res. \n712: 122-126 (1996), and Kim, D. K. et al. S \nNeuropsychopharmacology \n25: 84-90 (2001)), which indicates that it would deliver p97-conjugate(s) directly into the CNS.\n\n\nThe results show that intact p97 can cross brain ECs without affecting the integrity of the BBB and with a much higher rate than is seen with transferrin. The inhibition of p97 transcytosis by RAP in BBCEC monolayers and the competition of p97 uptake in brain capillaries by human lactoferrin show that LRP, a member of the LDL-R family, is involved in the transendothelial transport of p97. The results indicate that p97 and, more generally, ligands of the LRP and LRP1B receptors are preferred carriers for conjugation with active agents and preferred modulators for the transport of such conjugates via the LRP or LRP1B receptor.\n\n\nEach publication, patent application, patent, and other reference cited in any part of the specification is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the present disclosure.\n\n\nBased on the invention and examples disclosed herein, those skilled in the art will be able to develop other embodiments of the invention.

Description\n\n\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATION\n\n\nThis application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/900,744, filed on Sep. 13, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,732,459 which claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/204,930, filed Aug. 16, 2005, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/706,835, filed Nov. 12, 2003, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/425,947, filed Nov. 13, 2002. The entire teachings of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nChemoattractant cytokines or chemokines are a family of proinflammatory mediators that promote recruitment and activation of multiple lineages of leukocytes, such as T lymphocytes. Chemokines can be released by many kinds of tissue cells after activation. Release of chemokines at sites of inflammation mediates the ongoing migration of effector cells during chronic inflammation. The chemokines are related in primary structure and contain four conserved cysteines, which form disulfide bonds. The chemokine family includes the C—X—C chemokines (α-chemokines), and the C—C chemokines (β-chemokines), in which the first two conserved cysteines are separated by an intervening residue, or are adjacent, respectively (Baggiolini, M. and Dahinden, C. A., \nImmunology Today, \n15:127-133 (1994)).\n\n\nThe chemokine receptors are members of a superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) which share structural features that reflect a common mechanism of action of signal transduction (Gerard, C. and Gerard, N. P., \nAnnu Rev. Immunol., \n12:775-808 (1994); Gerard, C. and Gerard, N. P., \nCurr. Opin. Immunol., \n6:140-145 (1994)). Conserved features include seven hydrophobic domains spanning the plasma membrane, which are connected by hydrophilic extracellular and intracellular loops. The majority of the primary sequence homology occurs in the hydrophobic transmembrane regions with the hydrophilic regions being more diverse. The first receptor for the C—C chemokines that was cloned and expressed binds the chemokines MIP-1α and RANTES. Accordingly, this MIP-1α/RANTES receptor was designated C—C chemokine receptor 1 (also referred to as CCR-1 or CKR-1; Neote, K., et al., \nCell, \n72:415-425 (1993); Horuk, R et al., WO 94/11504, May 26, 1994; Gao, J.-I. et al., \nJ. Exp. Med., \n177:1421-1427 (1993)). CCR1 also binds the chemokines CCL2 (MCP-1) CCL4 (MIP-1β), CCL7 (MCP-3), CCL8 (MCP-2), CCL13 (MCP-4), CCL14 (HCC-1), CCL15 (Lkn-1), CCL23 (MPIF-1). (Murphy P. M. et al., International Union of Pharmacology. XXII. Nomenclature for Chemokine Receptors, \nPharmacol. Reviews, \n52:145-176 (2000).) The ability of chemokines, such as RANTES and MIP-1α, to induce the directed migration of monocytes and a memory population of circulating T-cells indicate that chemokines and chemokine receptors may play a critical role in chronic inflammatory diseases, since these diseases are characterized by destructive infiltrates of T cells and monocytes. (See, e.g., Schall, T. et al., \nNature, \n347:669-71 (1990).)\n\n\nSmall molecule antagonists of the interaction between C—C chemokine receptors (e.g., CCR1) and their ligands, including RANTES and MIP-1α, would provide compounds useful for inhibiting pathogenic processes “triggered” by receptor ligand interaction.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention relates to compounds having the formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R\n1 \nis halogen.\n\n\n\nThe invention further relates to a method for treating a disease characterized by pathogenic leukocyte recruitment, pathogenic leukocyte activation or pathogenic leukocyte recruitment and activation. The method comprises administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a compound described herein.\n\n\nThe invention further relates to compositions comprising a compound as described herein and a pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carrier or excipient.\n\n\nThe invention further relates to the use of the compounds described herein in therapy (including palliative, curative and prophylactic therapy) or diagnosis, and to the use of such compounds for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a particular disease or condition as described herein (e.g., inflammatory arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), inflammatory demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis)).\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe invention relates to compounds that are antagonists of C—C Chemokine Receptor 1 (CCR1), compositions comprising the compounds and methods of treating diseases or disorders that comprise administering one or more of the compounds. The antagonist compounds can inhibit binding of a ligand (e.g., a chemokine ligand such as CCL2 (MCP-1) CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL7 (MCP-3), CCL8 (MCP-2), CCL13 (MCP-4), CCL14 (HCC-1), CCL15 (Lkn-1), CCL23 (MPIF-1)) to CCR1. Accordingly, processes or cellular responses mediated by the binding of a chemokine to CCR1 can be inhibited (reduced or prevented, in whole or in part), including leukocyte migration, integrin activation, transient increases in the concentration of intracellular free calcium [Ca\n++\n]\ni\n, and/or granule release of proinflammatory mediators.\n\n\nThe compounds have the formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R\n1 \nis a halogen. Preferably, the halogen is selected from the group consisting of chloro, bromo and fluoro. More preferably, the halogen is chloro.\n\n\n\nAs described herein, compounds of Formula (I) and Formula (Ia) can be prepared as racemates or as substantially pure enantiomers (>99% enantiomeric excess). The optical configuration of the compounds of Formula (I) and Formula (Ia) are assigned using the (R),(S) method of Cahn-Ingold-Prelog. (See, J. March, “Advanced Organic Chemistry,” 4\nth \nEdition, Wiley Interscience, New York, pp. 109-111 (1992).)\n\n\nIn preferred embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) is the (S)-enantiomer, and has the structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R\n1 \nis a halogen.\n\n\n\nIn a particularly preferred embodiment, the compound is of Formula II wherein R\n1 \nis chloro.\n\n\nIn other preferred embodiments, the compound of Formula (Ia) is the (S)-enantiomer, and has the structure:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R\n1 \nis a halogen.\n\n\n\nIn a particularly preferred embodiment, the compound is of Formula IIa wherein R\n1 \nis chloro.\n\n\nThe (S)- and (R)-enantiomers of the invention can be prepared using any suitable method. For example, the enantiomers can be resolved from the racemate using chiral chromatography or recrystallization. Preferably, the (S)- and/or (R)-enantiomers are prepared by stereospecific synthesis as described herein.\n\n\nIn accordance with conventional methods for showing structural formulas of compounds, a terminal methyl group in a compound described herein can be shown as a straight line with or without “CH\n3\n” on its terminus:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe compounds disclosed herein can be obtained as E- and Z-configurational isomers. It is expressly pointed out that the invention includes compounds of the E-configuration and the Z-configuration around the double bond connecting the tricyclic moiety to the remainder of the molecule, and a method of treating a subject with compounds of the E-configuration, the Z-configuration, and mixtures thereof. Accordingly, in the structural formulas presented herein, the symbol: \n \n\n\nrepresents both the E-configuration and the Z-configuration. One configuration can have greater activity than another. Preferably, the pyridyl ring and the piperidinyl ring are in the cis configuration as shown in Formula (II) and Formula (IIa).\n\n\nThe invention includes all isomeric forms and racemic mixtures of the disclosed compounds, and a method of treating a subject with both pure isomers and mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures.\n\n\nThe compounds described herein can be prepared and administered as neutral compounds, salts, esters, amides and/or prodrugs. As used herein, “pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable salts, esters, amides, and prodrugs” are those salts (e.g., carboxylate salts, amino acid addition salts), esters, amides, and prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are suitable for use in contact with the tissues of a subject without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention.\n\n\nPharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds described herein include salts derived from nontoxic inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, hydrofluoric, phosphorous, and the like, and salts derived from nontoxic organic acids, such as aliphatic mono- and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic acids, alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, and the like. Such acid additional salts include, for example, sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, nitrate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, trifluoroacetate, propionate, caprylate, isobutyrate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, mandelate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, phthalate, benzenesulfonate, toluenesulfonate, phenylacetate, citrate, lactate, maleate, tartrate and methanesulfonate salts. Also contemplated are salts of amino acids such as arginate, gluconate, galacturonate and the like. (See, for example, Berge S. M. et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts,” \nJ. Pharma. Sci., \n66:1 (1977).)\n\n\nAcid addition salts of compounds which contain a basic group (e.g., amine) can be prepared using suitable methods. For example, acid addition salts can be prepared by contacting the free base form of a compound with a sufficient amount of a desired acid to produce the salt in the conventional manner. The free base form can be regenerated by contacting the salt form with a base and isolating the free base in the conventional manner. The free base form of a compound can differ from a salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents.\n\n\nPharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable base addition salts can be formed with suitable metals or amines, such as alkali and alkaline earth metals or organic amines. Examples of metals which are suitable for use as cations in base addition salts include sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and the like. Amines suitable for use as cations in base addition salts include N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, dicyclohexylamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine, and procaine.

A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, “Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,” Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series; and \nBioreversible Carriers in Drug Design\n, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Suitable prodrugs include pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable esters and amides of the compounds described herein. Examples of pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable, esters of the compounds of this invention include C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl esters. In certain embodiments, the alkyl group of the alkyl ester is a straight or branched chain C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl group. Acceptable alkyl esters also include C\n5\n-C\n7 \ncycloalkyl esters as well as arylalkyl esters such as, but not limited to benzyl. C\n1\n-C\n4 \nesters are preferred. Esters of the compounds of the present invention can be prepared using any suitable method.\n\n\nExamples of pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable, amides of the compounds of this invention include amides derived from ammonia, primary C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl amines and secondary C\n1\n-C\n6 \ndialkyl amines wherein the alkyl groups are straight or branched chain. In the case of secondary amines, the amine may also be in the form of a 5- or 6-membered heterocycle containing one nitrogen atom. Amides derived from ammonia, C\n1\n-C\n3 \nalkyl primary amines, and C\n1\n-C\n2 \ndialkyl secondary amines are preferred. Amides of the compounds of the invention may be prepared using any suitable method.\n\n\nCompositions\n\n\nThe invention also relates to pharmaceutical and/or physiological compositions which contain one or more of the compounds described herein. Such compositions can be formulated for administration by any desired route, such as orally, topically, by inhalation (e.g., intrabronchial, intranasal, oral inhalation or intranasal drops), rectally, transdermally, or parenterally. Generally the compositions comprise a compound of the invention (i.e., one or more compounds) as the active ingredient and a (one or more) suitable carrier, diluent, excipient, adjuvant and/or preservative. Formulation of a compound to be administered will vary according to the route of administration selected (e.g., solution, emulsion, capsule). Standard pharmaceutical formulation techniques can be employed. (See, generally, “Remington's Pharmaceutical Science,” 18\nth \nEdition, Mack Publishing. (1990); Baker, et al., “Controlled Release of Biological Active Agents,” John Wiley and Sons (1986), the entire teachings of both of the foregoing are incorporated herein by reference.)\n\n\nThe presence of microorganisms in the compositions can be controlled by various antibacterial and/or antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, alcohols (e.g., phenol, benzyl alcohol), sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example sugars, sodium chloride, and the like.\n\n\nCompositions suitable for parenteral injection can comprise physiologically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions.

Fluidity can be adjusted, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. When prolonged absorption of an injectable pharmaceutical composition is desired, agents that delay absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin can be included.\n\n\nSolid dosage forms for oral administration include, for example, capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active ingredient (i.e., one or more compounds of the invention) can be admixed with one or more carrier or excipient such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate; (a) fillers or extenders, for example, starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, silicic acid, polyethyleneglycols, and the like; (b) binders, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alignates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, and acacia; (c) humectants, for example, glycerol; (d) disintegrating agents, for example, agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain complex silicates, and sodium carbonate; (e) solution retarders, for example paraffin; (f) absorption accelerators, for example, quaternary ammonium compounds; (g) wetting agents, for example, cetyl alcohol, and glycerol monostearate; (h) adsorbents, for example, kaolin and bentonite; and (i) lubricants, for example, talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, or mixtures thereof. Solid compositions, such as those for oral administration, can also comprise buffering agents. Such solid compositions or solid compositions that are similar to those described can be provided in soft- or hard-filled gelatin capsules if desired.\n\n\nSolid dosage forms such as tablets, dragées, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings or other suitable coatings or shells. Several such coating and/or shells are well known in the art, and can contain opacifying agents, and can also be of such composition that they release the active compound or compounds in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used are polymeric substances and waxes. The active compounds can also be used in microencapsulated form, if appropriate, with, for example, one or more of the above-mentioned carriers or excipients.\n\n\nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms can contain a suitable carrier or excipient, such as water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, as for example, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propyleneglycol, 1,3-butyleneglycol, dimethylformamide, oils, in particular, cottonseed oil, groundnut oil, corn germ oil, olive oil, castor oil and sesame oil, glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethyleneglycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan or mixtures of these substances, and the like. If desired, the composition can also include wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring and/or perfuming agents. Suspensions can contain suspending agents, such as, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, tragacanth, and the like. Mixtures of suspending agents can be employed if desired. Suppositories (e.g., for rectal or vaginal administration) can be prepared by mixing one or more compounds of the invention with suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethyleneglycol, or a suppository wax which is solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and melts in the rectum or vagina, thereby releasing the active ingredient.\n\n\nDosage forms for topical administration include ointments, powders, sprays and inhalants. The active ingredient can be admixed under suitable conditions (e.g., sterile conditions) with a physiologically acceptable carrier and any preservatives, buffers, or propellants as may be required. Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, and solutions can also be prepared, for example, using suitable carriers or excipients. For inhalation, the compound can be solubilized and loaded into a suitable dispenser for administration (e.g., an atomizer, nebulizer or pressurized aerosol dispenser).\n\n\nThe quantity of active ingredient (one or more compounds of the invention) in the composition can range from about 0.1% to about 99.9% by weight. Preferably the quantity of active ingredient is about 10% to about 90%, or about 20% to about 80% by weight. A unit dose preparation can contain from 1 mg to about 1000 mg active ingredient, preferably about 10 mg to about 100 mg active ingredient. The composition can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents, such as theophylline, ÿ-adrenergic bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antihistamines, antiallergic agents, immunosuppressive agents (e.g., cyclosporin A, FK-506, prednisone, methylprednisolone), hormones (e.g., adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)), cytokines (e.g., interferons (e.g., IFNβ-1a, IFNβ-1b)) and the like.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the composition comprises (S)-5-{3-[4-(4-Chloro-phenyl)-4-hydroxy-3,3-dimethyl-piperidin-1-yl]-propylidene}-5,11-dihydro-10-oxa-1-aza-dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptene-7-carboxylic acid and a physiologically acceptable carrier or excipient.

For example, in a subject afflicted with multiple sclerosis, recruitment and/or activation of T cells in the central nervous system is considered “pathogenic leukocyte recruitment, pathogenic leukocyte activation or pathogenic leukocyte recruitment and activation,” because recruited and activated T cells contribute to the demyelination characteristic of that disease. Similarly, in a subject afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis, recruitment and/or activation of T cells in joints (e.g., synovial tissue or fluid) is considered “pathogenic leukocyte recruitment, pathogenic leukocyte activation or pathogenic leukocyte recruitment and activation,” because recruited and activated T cells contribute to the tissue destruction characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nDiseases and disorders characterized by pathogenic leukocyte recruitment, pathogenic leukocyte activation or pathogenic leukocyte recruitment and activation that can be treated according to the methods described herein include, for example, acute and chronic inflammatory disorders characterized by the presence of CCL2 (MCP-1) CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL7 (MCP-3), CCL8 (MCP-2), CCL13 (MCP-4), CCL14 (HCC-1), CCL15 (Lkn-1) and/or CCL23 (MPIF-1) responsive cells, such as T cells, monocytes or eosinophils. Such diseases or disorders include, but are not limited to, inflammatory arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), inflammatory demyelinating disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis), atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, restenosis, ischemia/reperfusion injury, diabetes mellitus (e.g., type 1 diabetes mellitus), psoriasis, inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, rejection (acute or chronic) of transplanted organs and tissues (e.g., acute allograft rejection, chronic allograft rejection), graft versus host disease, as well as allergies and asthma. Other diseases associated with aberrant leukocyte recruitment and/or activation which can be treated (including prophylactic treatments) with the methods disclosed herein are inflammatory diseases associated with viral (e.g., Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)), bacterial or fungal infection, such as, AIDS associated encephalitis, AIDS related maculopapular skin eruption, AIDS related interstitial pneumonia, AIDS related enteropathy, AIDS related periportal hepatic inflammation and AIDS related glomerulo nephritis. The method comprises administering to the subject in need of treatment an effective amount of a compound (i.e., one or more compounds) described herein.\n\n\nAs used herein “inflammatory demyelinating disease” refers to acute and chronic inflammatory diseases characterized by demyelination of central nervous system tissue. The inflammatory demyelinating disease can be an acute inflammatory demyelinating disease, for example, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome or acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis. In other embodiments, the inflammatory demyelinating disease can be a chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease, for example, multiple sclerosis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating multiple sclerosis, comprising administering an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (II) or (IIa) to a subject in need thereof. The manifestation of MS is variable and the clinical course of MS can be grouped into four categories: relapsing-remitting, primary progressive, secondary progressive and progressive-relapsing. The method of the invention can be used to treat MS which presents with each of the recognized clinical courses. Accordingly, a compound of the invention can be administered to a patient with a progressive course of MS to retard or prevent the progression of neurological impairment. A compound of the invention can also be administered to a subject with relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive or progressive-relapsing MS to inhibit relapse (e.g., an acute attack). For example, a compound of the invention can be administered to a subject with relapsing-remitting MS during the remitting phase of the disease to prevent or delay relapse.\n\n\nAs used herein, “inflammatory arthritis” refers to those diseases of joints where the immune system is causing or exacerbating inflammation in the joint, and includes rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthropathies, such as ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, psoriatic spondylitis, enteropathic arthritis, enteropathic spondylitis, juvenile-onset spondyloarthropathy and undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy. Inflammatory arthritis is generally characterized by infiltration of the synovial tissue and/or synovial fluid by leukocytes.\n\n\nIn another preferred embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating rheumatoid arthritis, comprising administering an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), (Ia), (II) or (IIa) to a subject in need thereof.\n\n\nA “subject” is preferably a bird or mammal, such as a human (\nHomo sapiens\n), but can also be an animal in need of veterinary treatment, e.g., domestic animals (e.g., dogs, cats, and the like), farm animals (e.g., cows, sheep, fowl, pigs, horses, and the like) and laboratory animals (e.g., rats, mice, guinea pigs, and the like).\n\n\nAn “effective amount” of a compound is an amount which inhibits binding of chemokine to receptor (e.g., CCR1) and thereby inhibits one or more processes mediated by the binding in a subject with a disease associated with pathogenic leukocyte recruitment, pathogenic leukocyte activation or pathogenic leukocyte recruitment and activation. Examples of such processes include leukocyte migration, integrin activation, transient increases in the concentration of intracellular free calcium [Ca\n2+\n]\ni \nand granule release of proinflammatory mediators. An “effective amount” of a compound can achieve a desired therapeutic and/or prophylactic effect, such as an amount which results in the prevention of or a decrease in the symptoms associated with a disease associated with pathogenic leukocyte recruitment, pathogenic leukocyte activation or pathogenic leukocyte recruitment and activation.\n\n\nThe amount of compound administered to the individual will depend on the type and severity of the disease and on the characteristics of the individual, such as general health, age, sex, body weight and tolerance to drugs. It will also depend on the degree, severity and type of disease. The skilled artisan will be able to determine appropriate dosages depending on these and other factors. An antagonist of chemokine receptor function can also be administered in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents, such as, theophylline, β-adrenergic bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antihistamines, antiallergic agents, immunosuppressive agents (e.g., cyclosporin A, FK-506, prednisone, methylprednisolone), hormones (e.g., adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)), cytokines (e.g., interferons (e.g., IFNβ-1a, IFNβ-1b)) and the like.\n\n\nWhen a compound of the invention is administered in combination with another therapeutic agent, the compound and agent can be administered in a manner that afford overlap of pharmacological activity, for example, concurrently or sequentially.\n\n\nThe compound can be administered by any suitable route, including, for example, orally in capsules, suspensions or tablets or by parenteral administration. Parenteral administration can include, for example, systemic administration, such as by intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection. The compound can also be administered orally (e.g., dietary), transdermally, topically, by inhalation (e.g., intrabronchial, intranasal, oral inhalation or intranasal drops), or rectally, depending on the disease or condition to be treated. Oral or parenteral administration are preferred modes of administration. The compound can be administered to the individual as part of a pharmaceutical or physiological composition.\n\n\nThe activity of compounds of the present invention can be assessed using suitable assays, such as receptor binding assays or chemotaxis assays. For example, as described in the Examples, small molecule antagonists of MIP-1ÿ binding have been identified utilizing THP-1 cells membranes. Specifically, a high through-put receptor binding assay, which monitors \n125\nI-MIP-1α binding to THP-1 cell membranes, was used to identify small molecule antagonists which block binding of MIP-1α. Compounds of the present invention can also be identified by virtue of their ability to inhibit the activation steps triggered by binding of a chemokine (e.g., CCL2 (MCP-1) CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL7 (MCP-3), CCL8 (MCP-2), CCL13 (MCP-4), CCL14 (HCC-1), CCL15 (Lkn-1), CCL23 (MPIF-1)) to its receptor (CCR-1), such as chemotaxis, integrin activation and granule mediator release. They can also be identified by virtue of their ability to block chemokine (e.g., CCL2 (MCP-1) CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β), CCL5 (RANTES), CCL7 (MCP-3), CCL8 (MCP-2), CCL13 (MCP-4), CCL14 (HCC-1), CCL15 (Lkn-1), CCL23 (MPIF-1)) induced chemotaxis of, for example, HL-60 cells, T-cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells or eosinophils.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(S)-5-{3-[4-(4-Chloro-phenyl)-4-hydroxy-3,3-dimethyl-piperidin-1-yl]-propylidene}-5,11-dihydro-10-oxa-1-aza-dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptene-7-carboxylic acid\n\n\nStep 1: 3,3-Dimethyl-4-oxo-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester\n\n\nTo a dry, 2 L 2-neck, round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a condenser, and a large 10° C. water bath was added 4-oxo-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (125 g, 628 mmol) and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (1 L). To the resulting yellow solution was added methyl iodide (85 mL, 1365 mmol). Sodium t-butoxide (150 g, 1560 mmol) was then added portionwise over 30 minutes. An exotherm was detected, especially at the beginning of the addition. The reaction mixture did warm to a gentle reflux, the rate was controlled by the speed of addition of base. The mixture was stirred an additional 30 minutes. The solvent was removed in vacuo. The oily residue was treated with NH\n4\nCl/water (500 mL), and extracted with ether (3×200 mL). The combined organics were washed with brine, dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n, and filtered through a short plug of silica gel. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the resulting yellow oil had started to crystallize. It was left under high vacuum overnight. The mixture was slurried in hexane (50-100 mL) and sonicated for one minute. The yellow solid was collected by filtration and washed with hexane (100 mL). The first crop of 3,3-dimethyl-4-oxo-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester yielded a yellow solid. (See, preparation of (37) in Vice, S. et al., \nJ. Org.

The assembly was flame-dried under dry nitrogen. The flask was charged with THF (700 mL) and 4-bromo-chlorobenzene (33.7 g, 176 mmol, 2.5 eq.). The resulting solution was cooled to −78° C. in a dry ice/acetone bath. To one of the dropping funnels was added butyllithium (2.5 M in hexanes, 70 mL, 175 mmol, 2.5 eq) via canula. The butyllithium solution was slowly added to the cold THF solution over 1 hour. Stirring continued for an additional 0.5 hour affording a white suspension. A solution of 3,3-dimethyl-4-oxo-piperidine-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (16.0 g, 70.5 mmol, 1 eq.) in THF (100 mL) was prepared and added to the reaction mixture via the second dropping funnel over 1.75 hours. The resulting mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 2 hours, at which time the reaction appeared to be essentially complete by TLC analysis. Saturated aqueous NH\n4\nCl (150 mL) was added and the reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature. Water (150 mL) was added and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (2+1 L). The combined extracts were washed with water and brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The solid residue was triturated with ethyl acetate and filtered. The supernatant was concentrated and triturated with ether. The resulting supernatant was then triturated with ether/petroleum ether.

The resulting yellow solution was stirred at 0° C. for an additional 1.5 hours. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue dissolved in ethyl acetate (1.2 L), and washed with aqueous sodium hydroxide (1 N, 150 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with additional ethyl acetate (200 mL) and the combined extracts were washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), and the cell pellets were frozen at −70 to −85° C. The frozen pellet was thawed in ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 5 mM HEPES (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethane-sulfonic acid) pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), 5 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and chymostatin (protease inhibitors), and 100 μg/ml PMSF (phenyl methane sulfonyl fluoride—also a protease inhibitor), at a concentration of 1 to 5×10\n7 \ncells/ml. This procedure results in cell lysis. The suspension was mixed well to resuspend all of the frozen cell pellet. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation of 400×g for 10 minutes at 4° C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and the membrane fragments were collected by centrifugation at 25,000×g for 30 minutes at 4° C. The supernatant was aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in freezing buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM sucrose, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and chymostatin, and 10 μg/ml PMSF (approximately 0.1 ml per each 10\n8 \ncells). All clumps were resolved using a minihomogenizer, and the total protein concentration was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif., cat #500-0002). The membrane solution was then aliquoted and frozen at −70 to −85° C. until needed.\n\n\nBinding Assays utilized the membranes described above. Membrane protein (2 to 20 μg total membrane protein) was incubated with 0.1 to 0.2 nM 125I-labeled MIP-1α with or without unlabeled competitor (MIP-1ÿ) or various concentrations of compounds. The binding reactions were performed in 60 to 100 μl of a binding buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 1 mM CaCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, and 0.5% BSA (bovine serum albumin), for 60 min at room temperature. The binding reactions were terminated by harvesting the membranes by rapid filtration through glass fiber filters (GF/B or GF/C, Packard) which were presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine. The filters were rinsed with approximately 600 μl of binding buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl, dried, and the amount of bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. The activities of test compounds are reported in the Table.\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\nIn Vivo Efficacy Model\n\n\nAn animal model of neutrophil recruitment in response to MIP-1α was used to evaluate the biological/pharmacodynamic activity of the compounds. Compounds were administered to female Hartley guinea pigs orally (doses ranged from about 0.5 mg/kg to about 5.0 mg/kg) 30 minutes prior to intradermal injections of murine MIP-1α (100 pmol/site) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Skin punch biopsies were taken 5 hours later and processed for myeloperoxidase (MPO) measurements. MPO activity was used as an indicator for neutrophil recruitment to the injection site.

Description\n\n\n\n\nRELATED APPLICATIONS SECTION\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Ser. No. 60/843,644 filed on Sep. 11, 2006 and U.S. Ser. No. 60/895,873 filed on Mar. 20, 2007, which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, Erb-B1) belongs to a family of proteins, involved in the proliferation of normal and malignant cells (Artega, C. L., \nJ. Clin Oncol \n19, 2001, 32-40). Overexpression of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is present in at least 70% of human cancers (Seymour, L. K., \nCurr Drug Targets \n2, 2001, 117-133) such as, non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC), breast cancers, gliomas, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and prostate cancer (Raymond et al., \nDrugs \n60 \nSuppl \n1, 2000, discussion 41-2; Salomon et al., \nCrit. Rev Oncol Hematol \n19, 1995, 183-232; Voldborg et al., \nAnn Oncol \n8, 1997, 1197-1206). The EGFR-TK is therefore widely recognized as an attractive target for the design and development of compounds that can specifically bind and inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity and its signal transduction pathway in cancer cells, and thus can serve as either diagnostic or therapeutic agents. For example, the EGFR tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) reversible inhibitor, Tarceva®, is recently approved by the FDA for treatment of NSCLC and advanced pancreatic cancer. Other anti-EGFR targeted molecules have also been approved such as Iressa®.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the early success of Tarceva, it has become clear that selectively targeting individual kinases can lead to the development of drug resistant tumors. Cells that have developed mutations within the drug/kinase binding pocket display a growth advantage in the presence of drug eventually leading to disease progression.

No. 11/852,604, corresponding to filed on even date herewith, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe invention further provides methods for the prevention or treatment of diseases or conditions involving aberrant proliferation, differentiation or survival of cells. In one embodiment, the invention further provides for the use of one or more compounds of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for halting or decreasing diseases involving aberrant proliferation, differentiation, or survival of cells. In preferred embodiments, the disease is cancer. In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method of treating cancer in a subject in need of treatment comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention.\n\n\nThe term “cancer” refers to any cancer caused by the proliferation of malignant neoplastic cells, such as tumors, neoplasms, carcinomas, sarcomas, leukemias, lymphomas and the like. For example, cancers include, but are not limited to, mesothelioma, leukemias and lymphomas such as cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL), noncutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphomas, lymphomas associated with human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV) such as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), B-cell lymphoma, acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL), Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma, acute-myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), or hepatocellular carcinoma.

Further, cancers include, but are not limited to, labial carcinoma, larynx carcinoma, hypopharynx carcinoma, tongue carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, thyroid cancer (medullary and papillary thyroid carcinoma, renal carcinoma, kidney parenchyma carcinoma, cervix carcinoma, uterine corpus carcinoma, endometrium carcinoma, chorion carcinoma, testis carcinoma, urinary carcinoma, melanoma, brain tumors such as glioblastoma, astrocytoma, meningioma, medulloblastoma and peripheral neuroectodermal tumors, gall bladder carcinoma, bronchial carcinoma, multiple myeloma, basalioma, teratoma, retinoblastoma, choroidea melanoma, seminoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, craniopharyngeoma, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, myosarcoma, liposarcoma, fibrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and plasmocytoma. In one aspect of the invention, the present invention provides for the use of one or more compounds of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of cancer.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the present invention includes the use of one or more compounds of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament that prevents further aberrant proliferation, differentiation, or survival of cells. For example, compounds of the invention may be useful in preventing tumors from increasing in size or from reaching a metastatic state. The subject compounds may be administered to halt the progression or advancement of cancer or to induce tumor apoptosis or to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. In addition, the instant invention includes use of the subject compounds to prevent a recurrence of cancer.\n\n\nThis invention further embraces the treatment or prevention of cell proliferative disorders such as hyperplasias, dysplasias and pre-cancerous lesions. Dysplasia is the earliest form of pre-cancerous lesion recognizable in a biopsy by a pathologist. The subject compounds may be administered for the purpose of preventing said hyperplasias, dysplasias or pre-cancerous lesions from continuing to expand or from becoming cancerous. Examples of pre-cancerous lesions may occur in skin, esophageal tissue, breast and cervical intra-epithelial tissue.\n\n\n“Combination therapy” includes the administration of the subject compounds in further combination with other biologically active ingredients (such as, but not limited to, a second and different antineoplastic agent) and non-drug therapies (such as, but not limited to, surgery or radiation treatment). For instance, the compounds of the invention can be used in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds, preferably compounds that are able to enhance the effect of the compounds of the invention. The compounds of the invention can be administered simultaneously (as a single preparation or separate preparation) or sequentially to the other drug therapy. In general, a combination therapy envisions administration of two or more drugs during a single cycle or course of therapy.\n\n\nIn one aspect of the invention, the subject compounds may be administered in combination with one or more separate agents that modulate protein kinases involved in various disease states. Examples of such kinases may include, but are not limited to: serine/threonine specific kinases, receptor tyrosine specific kinases and non-receptor tyrosine specific kinases. Serine/threonine kinases include mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK), meiosis specific kinase (MEK), RAF and aurora kinase. Examples of receptor kinase families include epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (e.g. HER2/neu, HER3, HER4, ErbB, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, Xmrk, DER, Let23); fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (e.g. FGF-R1, GFF-R2/BEK/CEK3, FGF-R3/CEK2, FGF-R4/TKF, KGF-R); hepatocyte growth/scatter factor receptor (HGFR) (e.g., MET, RON, SEA, SEX); insulin receptor (e.g. IGFI-R); Eph (e.g. CEK5, CEK8, EBK, ECK, EEK, EHK-1, EHK-2, ELK, EPH, ERK, HEK, MDK2, MDK5, SEK); Axl (e.g. Mer/Nyk, Rse); RET; and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) (e.g. PDGFα-R, PDGβ-R, CSF1-R/FMS, SCF-R/C-KIT, VEGF-R/FLT, NEK/FLK1, FLT3/FLK2/STK-1). Non-receptor tyrosine kinase families include, but are not limited to, BCR-ABL (e.g. p43\nabl\n, ARG); BTK (e.g. ITK/EMT, TEC); CSK, FAK, FPS, JAK, SRC, BMX, FER, CDK and SYK.\n\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, the subject compounds may be administered in combination with one or more separate agents that modulate non-kinase biological targets or processes. Such targets include histone deacetylases (HDAC), DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), heat shock proteins (e.g. HSP90), and proteosomes.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, subject compounds may be combined with antineoplastic agents (e.g. small molecules, monoclonal antibodies, antisense RNA, and fusion proteins) that inhibit one or more biological targets such as Zolinza, Tarceva, Iressa, Tykerb, Gleevec, Sutent, Sprycel, Nexavar, Sorafinib, CNF2024, RG108, BMS387032, Affinitak, Avastin, Herceptin, Erbitux, AG24322, PD325901, ZD6474, PD184322, Obatodax, ABT737 and AEE788. Such combinations may enhance therapeutic efficacy over efficacy achieved by any of the agents alone and may prevent or delay the appearance of resistant mutational variants.\n\n\nIn certain preferred embodiments, the compounds of the invention are administered in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent. Chemotherapeutic agents encompass a wide range of therapeutic treatments in the field of oncology. These agents are administered at various stages of the disease for the purposes of shrinking tumors, destroying remaining cancer cells left over after surgery, inducing remission, maintaining remission and/or alleviating symptoms relating to the cancer or its treatment. Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to, alkylating agents such as mustard gas derivatives (Mechlorethamine, cylophosphamide, chlorambucil, melphalan, ifosfamide), ethylenimines (thiotepa, hexamethylmelanine), Alkylsulfonates (Busulfan), Hydrazines and Triazines (Altretamine, Procarbazine, Dacarbazine and Temozolomide), Nitrosoureas (Carmustine, Lomustine and Streptozocin), Ifosfamide and metal salts (Carboplatin, Cisplatin, and Oxaliplatin); plant alkaloids such as Podophyllotoxins (Etoposide and Tenisopide), Taxanes (Paclitaxel and Docetaxel), Vinca alkaloids (Vincristine, Vinblastine, Vindesine and Vinorelbine), and Camptothecan analogs (Irinotecan and Topotecan); anti-tumor antibiotics such as Chromomycins (Dactinomycin and Plicamycin), Anthracyclines (Doxorubicin, Daunorubicin, Epirubicin, Mitoxantrone, Valrubicin and Idarubicin), and miscellaneous antibiotics such as Mitomycin, Actinomycin and Bleomycin; anti-metabolites such as folic acid antagonists (Methotrexate, Pemetrexed, Raltitrexed, Aminopterin), pyrimidine antagonists (5-Fluorouracil, Floxuridine, Cytarabine, Capecitabine, and Gemcitabine), purine antagonists (6-Mercaptopurine and 6-Thioguanine) and adenosine deaminase inhibitors (Cladribine, Fludarabine, Mercaptopurine, Clofarabine, Thioguanine, Nelarabine and Pentostatin); topoisomerase inhibitors such as topoisomerase I inhibitors (Ironotecan, topotecan) and topoisomerase II inhibitors (Amsacrine, etoposide, etoposide phosphate, teniposide); monoclonal antibodies (Alemtuzumab, Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, Rituximab, Trastuzumab, Ibritumomab Tioxetan, Cetuximab, Panitumumab, Tositumomab, Bevacizumab); and miscellaneous anti-neoplastics such as ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors (Hydroxyurea); adrenocortical steroid inhibitor (Mitotane); enzymes (Asparaginase and Pegaspargase); anti-microtubule agents (Estramustine); and retinoids (Bexarotene, Isotretinoin, Tretinoin (ATRA).\n\n\nIn certain preferred embodiments, the compounds of the invention are administered in combination with a chemoprotective agent. Chemoprotective agents act to protect the body or minimize the side effects of chemotherapy. Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to, amfostine, mesna, and dexrazoxane.\n\n\nIn one aspect of the invention, the subject compounds are administered in combination with radiation therapy. Radiation is commonly delivered internally (implantation of radioactive material near cancer site) or externally from a machine that employs photon (x-ray or gamma-ray) or particle radiation. Where the combination therapy further comprises radiation treatment, the radiation treatment may be conducted at any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the combination of the therapeutic agents and radiation treatment is achieved. For example, in appropriate cases, the beneficial effect is still achieved when the radiation treatment is temporally removed from the administration of the therapeutic agents, perhaps by days or even weeks.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that compounds of the invention can be used in combination with an immunotherapeutic agent. One form of immunotherapy is the generation of an active systemic tumor-specific immune response of host origin by administering a vaccine composition at a site distant from the tumor. Various types of vaccines have been proposed, including isolated tumor-antigen vaccines and anti-idiotype vaccines. Another approach is to use tumor cells from the subject to be treated, or a derivative of such cells (reviewed by Schirrmacher et al. (1995) J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 121:487). In U.S. Pat. No. 5,484,596, Hanna Jr. et al. claim a method for treating a resectable carcinoma to prevent recurrence or metastases, comprising surgically removing the tumor, dispersing the cells with collagenase, irradiating the cells, and vaccinating the patient with at least three consecutive doses of about 10\n7 \ncells.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that the compounds of the invention may advantageously be used in conjunction with one or more adjunctive therapeutic agents. Examples of suitable agents for adjunctive therapy include a 5HT\n1 \nagonist, such as a triptan (e.g. sumatriptan or naratriptan); an adenosine A1 agonist; an EP ligand; an NMDA modulator, such as a glycine antagonist; a sodium channel blocker (e.g. lamotrigine); a substance P antagonist (e.g. an NK\n1 \nantagonist); a cannabinoid; acetaminophen or phenacetin; a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor; a leukotriene receptor antagonist; a DMARD (e.g. methotrexate); gabapentin and related compounds; a tricyclic antidepressant (e.g. amitryptilline); a neurone stabilising antiepileptic drug; a mono-aminergic uptake inhibitor (e.g. venlafaxine); a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor; a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, such as an iNOS or an nNOS inhibitor; an inhibitor of the release, or action, of tumour necrosis factor .alpha.; an antibody therapy, such as a monoclonal antibody therapy; an antiviral agent, such as a nucleoside inhibitor (e.g. lamivudine) or an immune system modulator (e.g. interferon); an opioid analgesic; a local anaesthetic; a stimulant, including caffeine; an H\n2\n-antagonist (e.g. ranitidine); a proton pump inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole); an antacid (e.g. aluminium or magnesium hydroxide; an antiflatulent (e.g. simethicone); a decongestant (e.g. phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline, epinephrine, naphazoline, xylometazoline, propylhexedrine, or levo-desoxyephedrine); an antitussive (e.g. codeine, hydrocodone, carmiphen, carbetapentane, or dextramethorphan); a diuretic; or a sedating or non-sedating antihistamine.\n\n\nMatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent neutral endopeptidases collectively capable of degrading essentially all matrix components. Over 20 MMP modulating agents are in pharmaceutical develop, almost half of which are indicated for cancer. The University of Toronto researchers have reported that HDACs regulate MMP expression and activity in 3T3 cells. In particular, inhibition of HDAC by trichostatin A (TSA), which has been shown to prevent tumorigenesis and metastasis, decreases mRNA as well as zymographic activity of gelatinase A (MMP2; Type IV collagenase), a matrix metalloproteinase, which is itself, implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis (Ailenberg M., Silverman M., \nBiochem Biophys Res Commun. \n2002, 298:110-115). Another recent article that discusses the relationship of HDAC and MMPs can be found in Young D. A., et al., \nArthritis Research \n& \nTherapy, \n2005, 7: 503. Furthermore, the commonality between HDAC and MMPs inhibitors is their zinc-binding functionality. Therefore, in one aspect of the invention, compounds of the invention can be used as MMP inhibitors and may be of use in the treatment of disorders relating to or associated with dysregulation of MMP. The overexpression and activation of MMPs are known to induce tissue destruction and are also associated with a number of specific diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease, cancer and atherosclerosis.\n\n\nThe compounds may also be used in the treatment of a disorder involving, relating to or, associated with dysregulation of histone deacetylase (HDAC). There are a number of disorders that have been implicated by or known to be mediated at least in part by HDAC activity, where HDAC activity is known to play a role in triggering disease onset, or whose symptoms are known or have been shown to be alleviated by HDAC inhibitors. Disorders of this type that would be expected to be amenable to treatment with the compounds of the invention include the following but not limited to: Anti-proliferative disorders (e.g. cancers); Neurodegenerative diseases including Huntington's Disease, Polyglutamine disease, Parkinson's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease, Seizures, Striatonigral degeneration, Progressive supranuclear palsy, Torsion dystonia, Spasmodic torticollis and dyskinesis, Familial tremor, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, Diffuse Lewy body disease, Progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick's disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, Primary lateral sclerosis, Spinal muscular atrophy, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Hypertrophic interstitial polyneuropathy, Retinitis pigmentosa, Hereditary optic atrophy, Hereditary spastic paraplegia, Progressive ataxia and Shy-Drager syndrome; Metabolic diseases including Type 2 diabetes; Degenerative Diseases of the Eye including Glaucoma, Age-related macular degeneration, Rubeotic glaucoma; Inflammatory diseases and/or Immune system disorders including Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Osteoarthritis, Juvenile chronic arthritis, Graft versus Host disease, Psoriasis, Asthma, Spondyloarthropathy, Crohn's Disease, inflammatory bowel disease Colitis Ulcerosa, Alcoholic hepatitis, Diabetes, Sjoegrens's syndrome, Multiple Sclerosis, Ankylosing spondylitis, Membranous glomerulopathy, Discogenic pain, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus; Disease involving angiogenesis including cancer, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis; Psychological disorders including bipolar disease, schizophrenia, mania, depression and dementia; Cardiovascular Diseases including heart failure, restenosis and arteriosclerosis; Fibrotic diseases including liver fibrosis, cystic fibrosis and angiofibroma; Infectious diseases including Fungal infections, such as \nCandida Albicans\n, Bacterial infections, Viral infections, such as Herpes Simplex, Protozoal infections, such as Malaria, \nLeishmania \ninfection, \nTrypanosoma brucei \ninfection, Toxoplasmosis and coccidlosis and Haematopoietic disorders including thalassemia, anemia and sickle cell anemia.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, compounds of the invention can be used to induce or inhibit apoptosis, a physiological cell death process critical for normal development and homeostasis. Alterations of apoptotic pathways contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases. Compounds of the invention, as modulators of apoptosis, will be useful in the treatment of a variety of human diseases with aberrations in apoptosis including cancer (particularly, but not limited to, follicular lymphomas, carcinomas with p53 mutations, hormone dependent tumors of the breast, prostate and ovary, and precancerous lesions such as familial adenomatous polyposis), viral infections (including, but not limited to, herpesvirus, poxvirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Sindbis virus and adenovirus), autoimmune diseases (including, but not limited to, systemic lupus, erythematosus, immune mediated glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and autoimmune diabetes mellitus), neurodegenerative disorders (including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, AIDS-related dementia, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, retinitis pigmentosa, spinal muscular atrophy and cerebellar degeneration), AIDS, myelodysplastic syndromes, aplastic anemia, ischemic injury associated myocardial infarctions, stroke and reperfusion injury, arrhythmia, atherosclerosis, toxin-induced or alcohol induced liver diseases, hematological diseases (including, but not limited to, chronic anemia and aplastic anemia), degenerative diseases of the musculoskeletal system (including, but not limited to, osteoporosis and arthritis), aspirin-sensitive rhinosinusitis, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, kidney diseases, and cancer pain.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides the use of compounds of the invention for the treatment and/or prevention of immune response or immune-mediated responses and diseases, such as the prevention or treatment of rejection following transplantation of synthetic or organic grafting materials, cells, organs or tissue to replace all or part of the function of tissues, such as heart, kidney, liver, bone marrow, skin, cornea, vessels, lung, pancreas, intestine, limb, muscle, nerve tissue, duodenum, small-bowel, pancreatic-islet-cell, including xeno-transplants, etc.; to treat or prevent graft-versus-host disease, autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, type I diabetes uveitis, juvenile-onset or recent-onset diabetes mellitus, uveitis, Graves disease, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, vasculitis, auto-antibody mediated diseases, aplastic anemia, Evan's syndrome, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and the like; and further to treat infectious diseases causing aberrant immune response and/or activation, such as traumatic or pathogen induced immune disregulation, including for example, that which are caused by hepatitis B and C infections, HIV, \nstaphylococcus aureus \ninfection, viral encephalitis, sepsis, parasitic diseases wherein damage is induced by an inflammatory response (e.g., leprosy); and to prevent or treat circulatory diseases, such as arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa and myocarditis. In addition, the present invention may be used to prevent/suppress an immune response associated with a gene therapy treatment, such as the introduction of foreign genes into autologous cells and expression of the encoded product.

The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide.\n\n\nIn addition, the compositions may further comprise binders (e.g., acacia, cornstarch, gelatin, carbomer, ethyl cellulose, guar gum, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, povidone), disintegrating agents (e.g., cornstarch, potato starch, alginic acid, silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, guar gum, sodium starch glycolate, Primogel), buffers (e.g., tris-HCl., acetate, phosphate) of various pH and ionic strength, additives such as albumin or gelatin to prevent absorption to surfaces, detergents (e.g., Tween 20, Tween 80, Pluronic F68, bile acid salts), protease inhibitors, surfactants (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate), permeation enhancers, solubilizing agents (e.g., glycerol, polyethylene glycerol, cyclodextrins), a glidant (e.g., colloidal silicon dioxide), anti-oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite, butylated hydroxyanisole), stabilizers (e.g., hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), viscosity increasing agents (e.g., carbomer, colloidal silicon dioxide, ethyl cellulose, guar gum), sweeteners (e.g., sucrose, aspartame, citric acid), flavoring agents (e.g., peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring), preservatives (e.g., Thimerosal, benzyl alcohol, parabens), lubricants (e.g., stearic acid, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate), flow-aids (e.g., colloidal silicon dioxide), plasticizers (e.g., diethyl phthalate, triethyl citrate), emulsifiers (e.g., carbomer, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate), polymer coatings (e.g., poloxamers or poloxamines), coating and film forming agents (e.g., ethyl cellulose, acrylates, polymethacrylates) and/or adjuvants.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811.\n\n\nIt is especially advantageous to formulate oral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals.\n\n\nIn one preferred embodiment, the compound can be formulated in an aqueous solution for intravenous injection. In one embodiment, solubilizing agents can be suitably employed. A particularly preferred solubilizing agent includes cyclodextrins and modified cyclodextrins, such as sulfonic acid substituted β-cyclodextrin derivative or salt thereof. An example of such a solubilizing agent is sold under the trademark CAPTISOL® by CyDex, Inc. CAPTISOL is a polyanionic β-cyclodextrin derivative with a sodium sulfonate salt separated from the lipophilic cavity by a butyl ether spacer group, or sulfobutylether (SBE). The selection of the SBE7-β-CD as the cyclodextrin with the most desirable safety profile and drug carrier properties is based upon evaluations of the mono, tetra and hepta-substituted preparations (SBE1, SBE4, and SBE7). CAPTISOL is the trade name for CyDex's SBE7-β-CD PRODUCT.\n\n\nRelative to β-cyclodextrin, the preferred solubilizing agents, such as CAPTISOL®, provide superior water solubility in excess of 70, preferably 90 grams/100 ml.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the solubilizing agent is added to the aqueous solution in an amount of at least 15% weight/volume, preferably about 30% weight/volume. Additional optional excipients can include dextran in an amount of at least about 1% weight/volume, preferably about 5% weight/volume.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration.\n\n\nDaily administration may be repeated continuously for a period of several days to several years. Oral treatment may continue for between one week and the life of the patient. Preferably the administration may take place for five consecutive days after which time the patient can be evaluated to determine if further administration is required. The administration can be continuous or intermittent, e.g., treatment for a number of consecutive days followed by a rest period. The compounds of the present invention may be administered intravenously on the first day of treatment, with oral administration on the second day and all consecutive days thereafter.\n\n\nThe preparation of pharmaceutical compositions that contain an active component is well understood in the art, for example, by mixing, granulating, or tablet-forming processes. The active therapeutic ingredient is often mixed with excipients that are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient. For oral administration, the active agents are mixed with additives customary for this purpose, such as vehicles, stabilizers, or inert diluents, and converted by customary methods into suitable forms for administration, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard or soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions and the like as detailed above.\n\n\nThe amount of the compound administered to the patient is less than an amount that would cause toxicity in the patient. In certain embodiments, the amount of the compound that is administered to the patient is less than the amount that causes a concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma to equal or exceed the toxic level of the compound. Preferably, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 10 nM. In one embodiment, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 25 nM. In one embodiment, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 50 nM. In one embodiment, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 100 nM. In one embodiment, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 500 nM. In one embodiment, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 1000 nM. In one embodiment, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 2500 nM. In one embodiment, the concentration of the compound in the patient's plasma is maintained at about 5000 nM. The optimal amount of the compound that should be administered to the patient in the practice of the present invention will depend on the particular compound used and the type of cancer being treated.\n\n\nDefinitions\n\n\nListed below are definitions of various terms used to describe this invention.

Specifically, angiogenesis is a multi-step process in which endothelial cells focally degrade and invade through their own basement membrane, migrate through interstitial stroma toward an angiogenic stimulus, proliferate proximal to the migrating tip, organize into blood vessels, and reattach to newly synthesized basement membrane (see Folkman et al., Adv. Cancer Res., Vol. 43, pp. 175-203 (1985)). Anti-angiogenic agents interfere with this process. Examples of agents that interfere with several of these steps include thrombospondin-1, angiostatin, endostatin, interferon alpha and compounds such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors that block the actions of enzymes that clear and create paths for newly forming blood vessels to follow; compounds, such as .alpha.v.beta.3 inhibitors, that interfere with molecules that blood vessel cells use to bridge between a parent blood vessel and a tumor; agents, such as specific COX-2 inhibitors, that prevent the growth of cells that form new blood vessels; and protein-based compounds that simultaneously interfere with several of these targets.\n\n\nThe term “apoptosis” as used herein refers to programmed cell death as signaled by the nuclei in normally functioning human and animal cells when age or state of cell health and condition dictates. An “apoptosis inducing agent” triggers the process of programmed cell death.\n\n\nThe term “cancer” as used herein denotes a class of diseases or disorders characterized by uncontrolled division of cells and the ability of these cells to invade other tissues, either by direct growth into adjacent tissue through invasion or by implantation into distant sites by metastasis.\n\n\nThe term “devices” refers to any appliance, usually mechanical or electrical, designed to perform a particular function.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “dysplasia” refers to abnormal cell growth and typically refers to the earliest form of pre-cancerous lesion recognizable in a biopsy by a pathologist.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “effective amount of the subject compounds,” with respect to the subject method of treatment, refers to an amount of the subject compound which, when delivered as part of desired dose regimen, brings about, e.g. a change in the rate of cell proliferation and/or state of differentiation and/or rate of survival of a cell to clinically acceptable standards. This amount may further relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of a neoplasia disorder, including, but is not limited to: 1) reduction in the number of cancer cells; 2) reduction in tumor size; 3) inhibition (i.e., slowing to some extent, preferably stopping) of cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; 3) inhibition (i.e., slowing to some extent, preferably stopping) of tumor metastasis; 4) inhibition, to some extent, of tumor growth; 5) relieving or reducing to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the disorder; and/or 6) relieving or reducing the side effects associated with the administration of anticancer agents.\n\n\nThe term “hyperplasia,” as used herein, refers to excessive cell division or growth.\n\n\nThe phrase an “immunotherapeutic agent” refers to agents used to transfer the immunity of an immune donor, e.g., another person or an animal, to a host by inoculation.

Adoptive immunotherapy refers to the treatment of a disease by therapy or agents that include host inoculation of sensitized lymphocytes, transfer factor, immune RNA, or antibodies in serum or gamma globulin.\n\n\nThe term “inhibition,” in the context of neoplasia, tumor growth or tumor cell growth, may be assessed by delayed appearance of primary or secondary tumors, slowed development of primary or secondary tumors, decreased occurrence of primary or secondary tumors, slowed or decreased severity of secondary effects of disease, arrested tumor growth and regression of tumors, among others. In the extreme, complete inhibition, is referred to herein as prevention or chemoprevention.\n\n\nThe term “metastasis,” as used herein, refers to the migration of cancer cells from the original tumor site through the blood and lymph vessels to produce cancers in other tissues. Metastasis also is the term used for a secondary cancer growing at a distant site.\n\n\nThe term “neoplasm,” as used herein, refers to an abnormal mass of tissue that results from excessive cell division. Neoplasms may be benign (not cancerous), or malignant (cancerous) and may also be called a tumor. The term “neoplasia” is the pathological process that results in tumor formation.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “pre-cancerous” refers to a condition that is not malignant, but is likely to become malignant if left untreated.\n\n\nThe term “proliferation” refers to cells undergoing mitosis.\n\n\nThe phrase “EGFR-TK related disease or disorder” refers to a disease or disorder characterized by inappropriate EGFR-TK activity or over-activity of the EGFR-TK. Inappropriate activity refers to either; (i) EGFR-TK expression in cells which normally do not express EGFR-TKs; (ii) increased EGFR-TK expression leading to unwanted cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth; or, (iii) decreased EGFR-TK expression leading to unwanted reductions in cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth. Over-activity of EGFR-TKs refers to either amplification of the gene encoding a particular EGFR-TK or production of a level of EGFR-TK activity which can correlate with a cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth disorder (that is, as the level of the EGFR-TK increases, the severity of one or more of the symptoms of the cellular disorder increases). Over activity can also be the result of ligand independent or constitutive activation as a result of mutations such as deletions of a fragment of a EGFR-TK responsible for ligand binding.\n\n\nThe phrase a “radio therapeutic agent” refers to the use of electromagnetic or particulate radiation in the treatment of neoplasia.\n\n\nThe term “recurrence” as used herein refers to the return of cancer after a period of remission.

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge, et al. describes pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical \nSciences, \n66: 1-19 (1977). The salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention, or separately by reacting the free base function with a suitable organic acid or inorganic acid. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic acid addition salts include, but are not limited to, salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid lactobionic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange.

Suitable ester groups include, for example, those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable aliphatic carboxylic acids, particularly alkanoic, alkenoic, cycloalkanoic and alkanedioic acids, in which each alkyl or alkenyl moiety advantageously has not more than 6 carbon atoms. Examples of particular esters include, but are not limited to, formates, acetates, propionates, butyrates, acrylates and ethylsuccinates.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs” as used herein refers to those prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals with undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the present invention. “Prodrug”, as used herein means a compound which is convertible in vivo by metabolic means (e.g. by hydrolysis) to a compound of the invention. Various forms of prodrugs are known in the art, for example, as discussed in Bundgaard, (ed.), Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier (1985); Widder, et al. (ed.), Methods in Enzymology, vol. 4, Academic Press (1985); Krogsgaard-Larsen, et al., (ed). “Design and Application of Prodrugs, Textbook of Drug Design and Development, Chapter 5, 113-191 (1991); Bundgaard, et al., Journal of Drug Deliver Reviews, 8:1-38 (1992); Bundgaard, J. of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 77:285 et seq. (1988); Higuchi and Stella (eds.) Prodrugs as Novel Drug Delivery Systems, American Chemical Society (1975); and Bernard Testa & Joachim Mayer, “Hydrolysis In Drug And Prodrug Metabolism: Chemistry, Biochemistry And Enzymology,” John Wiley and Sons, Ltd. (2002). Examples of particularly preferred prodrugs include esters of the carboxylic acids of the invention. Preferred esters include aliphatic esters (e.g., alkyl, such as lower alkyl esters) and aromatic esters (such as phenyl esters). Other prodrugs include derivatives of the acid group that can be hydrolyzed in vivo.\n\n\nAs used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” is intended to include any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration, such as sterile pyrogen-free water. Suitable carriers are described in the most recent edition of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, a standard reference text in the field, which is incorporated herein by reference. Preferred examples of such carriers or diluents include, but are not limited to, water, saline, finger's solutions, dextrose solution, and 5% human serum albumin. Liposomes and non-aqueous vehicles such as fixed oils may also be used. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “pre-cancerous” refers to a condition that is not malignant, but is likely to become malignant if left untreated.\n\n\nThe term “subject” as used herein refers to an animal. Preferably the animal is a mammal. More preferably the mammal is a human. A subject also refers to, for example, dogs, cats, horses, cows, pigs, guinea pigs, fish, birds and the like.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention may be modified by appending appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and may include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion.\n\n\nThe synthesized compounds can be separated from a reaction mixture and further purified by a method such as column chromatography, high pressure liquid chromatography, or recrystallization. As can be appreciated by the skilled artisan, further methods of synthesizing the compounds of the formulae herein will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, the various synthetic steps may be performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the desired compounds. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing the compounds described herein are known in the art and include, for example, those such as described in R. Larock, \nComprehensive Organic Transformations\n, VCH Publishers (1989); T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, \nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis, \n2d. Ed., John Wiley and Sons (1991); L. Fieser and M. Fieser, \nFieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis\n, John Wiley and Sons (1994); and L. Paquette, ed., \nEncyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis\n, John Wiley and Sons (1995), and subsequent editions thereof.\n\n\nThe compounds described herein may contain one or more asymmetric centers and thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)— or (S)—, or as (D)- or (L)— for amino acids. The present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. Optical isomers may be prepared from their respective optically active precursors by the procedures described above, or by resolving the racemic mixtures. The resolution can be carried out in the presence of a resolving agent, by chromatography or by repeated crystallization or by some combination of these techniques which are known to those skilled in the art. Further details regarding resolutions can be found in Jacques, et al., \nEnantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions \n(John Wiley & Sons, 1981). When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, other unsaturation, or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers and/or cis- and trans-isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included. The configuration of any carbon-carbon double bond appearing herein is selected for convenience only and is not intended to designate a particular configuration unless the text so states; thus a carbon-carbon double bond or carbon-heteroatom double bond depicted arbitrarily herein as trans may be cis, trans, or a mixture of the two in any proportion.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient” means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; cyclodextrins such as alpha- (α), beta- (β) and gamma- (γ) cyclodextrins; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols such as propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as solubilizing agents, coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir, preferably by oral administration or administration by injection. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may contain any conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, adjuvants or vehicles. In some cases, the pH of the formulation may be adjusted with pharmaceutically acceptable acids, bases or buffers to enhance the stability of the formulated compound or its delivery form. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intraarterial, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.\n\n\nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.\n\n\nInjectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions, may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\nThe injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.\n\n\nIn order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution, which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.\n\n\nCompositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.\n\n\nSolid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or: a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.\n\n\nSolid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.\n\n\nThe solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.\n\n\nDosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nThe ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof.\n\n\nPowders and sprays can contain, in addition to the compounds of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons.\n\n\nTransdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.\n\n\nFor pulmonary delivery, a therapeutic composition of the invention is formulated and administered to the patient in solid or liquid particulate form by direct administration e.g., inhalation into the respiratory system. Solid or liquid particulate forms of the active compound prepared for practicing the present invention include particles of respirable size: that is, particles of a size sufficiently small to pass through the mouth and larynx upon inhalation and into the bronchi and alveoli of the lungs. Delivery of aerosolized therapeutics, particularly aerosolized antibiotics, is known in the art (see, for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,068 to VanDevanter et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,508,269 to Smith et al, and WO 98/43,650 by Montgomery, all of which are incorporated herein by reference). A discussion of pulmonary delivery of antibiotics is also found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,014,969, incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nBy a “therapeutically effective amount” of a compound of the invention is meant an amount of the compound which confers a therapeutic effect on the treated subject, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. The therapeutic effect may be objective (i.e., measurable by some test or marker) or subjective (i.e., subject gives an indication of or feels an effect). An effective amount of the compound described above may range from about 0.1 mg/Kg to about 500 mg/Kg, preferably from about 1 to about 50 mg/Kg. Effective doses will also vary depending on route of administration, as well as the possibility of co-usage with other agents. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or contemporaneously with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts.\n\n\nThe total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a human or other animal in single or in divided doses can be in amounts, for example, from 0.01 to 50 mg/kg body weight or more usually from 0.1 to 25 mg/kg body weight. Single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. In general, treatment regimens according to the present invention comprise administration to a patient in need of such treatment from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg of the compound(s) of this invention per day in single or multiple doses.\n\n\nThe compounds of the formulae described herein can, for example, be administered by injection, intravenously, intraarterially, subdermally, intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously; or orally, buccally, nasally, transmucosally, topically, in an ophthalmic preparation, or by inhalation, with a dosage ranging from about 0.1 to about 500 mg/kg of body weight, alternatively dosages between 1 mg and 1000 mg/dose, every 4 to 120 hours, or according to the requirements of the particular drug. The methods herein contemplate administration of an effective amount of compound or compound composition to achieve the desired or stated effect. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be administered from about 1 to about 6 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with pharmaceutically excipients or carriers to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. A typical preparation will contain from about 5% to about 95% active compound (w/w). Alternatively, such preparations may contain from about 20% to about 80% active compound.\n\n\nLower or higher doses than those recited above may be required. Specific dosage and treatment regimens for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health status, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity and course of the disease, condition or symptoms, the patient's disposition to the disease, condition or symptoms, and the judgment of the treating physician.\n\n\nUpon improvement of a patient's condition, a maintenance dose of a compound, composition or combination of this invention may be administered, if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved condition is retained when the symptoms have been alleviated to the desired level. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of disease symptoms.\n\n\nSynthetic Methods\n\n\nA quinazoline derivative of the formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, may be prepared by any process known to be applicable to the preparation of chemically-related compounds.

Allow wash to shake on a rotator for 5 minutes at room temperature. Repeat washing steps 4 more times after removing wash manually. Using a multi-channel pipettor, block cells/wells by adding 100 μl of LI-COR Odyssey Blocking Buffer to each well. Allow blocking for 90 minutes at RT with moderate shaking on a rotator. Add the two primary antibodies into a tube containing Odyssey Blocking Buffer. Mix the primary antibody solution well before addition to wells (Phospho-EGFR Tyr1045, (Rabbit; 1:100 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, 2237; Total EGFR, Mouse; 1:500 dilution; Biosource International, AHR5062). Remove blocking buffer from the blocking step and added 40 μl of the desired primary antibody or antibodies in Odyssey Blocking Buffer to cover the bottom of each well. Add 100 μl of Odyssey Blocking Buffer only to control wells. Incubate with primary antibody overnight with gentle shaking at RT. Wash the plate five times with 1×PBS+0.1% Tween-20 for 5 minutes at RT with gentle shaking, using a generous amount of buffer. Using a multi-channel pipettor add 200 μl of Tween Washing Solution. Allow wash to shake on a rotator for 5 minutes at RT. Repeat washing steps 4 more times. Dilute the fluorescently labeled secondary antibody in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (Goat anti-mouse IRDye™ 680 (1:200 dilution; LI-COR Cat. #926-32220) Goat anti-rabbit IRDye™ 800CW (1:800 dilution; LI-COR Cat. #926-32211). Mix the antibody solutions well and added 40 μl of the secondary antibody solution to each well. Incubate for 60 minutes with gentle shaking at RT. Protect plate from light during incubation. Wash the plate five times with 1×PBS+0.1% Tween-20 for 5 minutes at RT with gentle shaking, using a generous amount of buffer. Using a multi-channel pipettor add 200 μl of Tween Washing Solution. Allow wash to shake on a rotator for 5 minutes at RT. Repeat washing steps 4 more times. After final wash, remove wash solution completely from wells. Turned the plate upside down and tap or blot gently on paper towels to remove traces of wash buffer. Scan the plate with detection in both the 700 and 800 channels using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (700 nm detection for IRDye™ 680 antibody and 800 nm detection for IRDye™ 800CW antibody). Determine the ratio of total to phosphorylated protein (700/800) using Odyssey software and plot the results in Graphpad Prism (V4.0a). Data can be plotted using GraphPad Prism (v4.0a) and IC50's calculated using a sigmoidal dose response curve fitting algorithm.\n\n\n(c) An In Vitro Assay which Determines the Ability of a Test Compound to Inhibit HDAC Enzymatic Activity.\n\n\nHDAC inhibitors are screened using an HDAC fluorimetric assay kit (AK-500, Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, Pa.). Test compounds can be dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) to give a 20 mM working stock concentration. Fluorescence is measured on a WALLAC Victor 2 plate reader and reported as relative fluorescence units (RFU). Data are plotted using GraphPad Prism (v4.0a) and IC50's calculated using a sigmoidal dose response curve fitting algorithm. Each assay is setup as follows: Defrost all kit components and keep on ice until use. Dilute HeLa nuclear extract 1:29 in Assay Buffer (50 mM Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2). Prepare dilutions of Trichostatin A (TSA, positive control) and test compounds in assay buffer (5× of final concentration). Dilute Fluor de Lys™ Substrate in assay buffer to 100 uM (50 fold=2× final). Dilute Fluor de Lys™ developer concentrate 20-fold (e.g. 50 μl plus 950 μl Assay Buffer) in cold assay buffer. Second, dilute the 0.2 mM Trichostatin A 100-fold in the 1× Developer (e.g. 10 μl in 1 ml; final Trichostatin A concentration in the 1× Developer=2 μM; final concentration after addition to HDAC/Substrate reaction=1 μM). Add Assay buffer, diluted trichostatin A or test inhibitor to appropriate wells of the microtiter plate. Add diluted HeLa extract or other HDAC sample to all wells except for negative controls. Allow diluted Fluor de Lys™ Substrate and the samples in the microtiter plate to equilibrate to assay temperature (e.g. 25 or 37° C. Initiate HDAC reactions by adding diluted substrate (25 μl) to each well and mixing thoroughly. Allow HDAC reactions to proceed for 1 hour and then stopped them by addition of Fluor de Lys™ Developer (50 μ). Incubate plate at room temperature (25° C.) for 10-15 min. Read samples in a microtiter-plate reading fluorimeter capable of excitation at a wavelength in the range 350-380 nm and detection of emitted light in the range 440-460 nm.\n\n\nThe following compounds in TABLE B were screened in assays substantially as described above.

The cells are incubated with compounds for 72 hours in the presence of 0.5% of fetal bovine serum. Growth inhibition is accessed by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content assay using Perkin Elmer ATPlite kit. ATPlite is an ATP monitoring system based on firefly luciferase. Briefly, 25 μl of mammalian cell lysis solution is added to 50 μl of phenol red-free culture medium per well to lyse the cells and stabilize the ATP. 25 μl of substrate solution is then added to the well and subsequently the luminescence is measured.\n\n\nTumor cell lines that can be assayed include those listed in TABLES C and D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCell Line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBreast_MCF7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBreast_MDAMB468\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBreast_SkBr3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nColon_HCT116\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEpidermoid_A431\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLung_H1703\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLung_H1975\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLung_H2122\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLung_H292\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLung_H358\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLung_H460\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLung_HCC827\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPancreas_BxPC3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPancreas_Capan1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPancreas_CFPAC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPancreas_HPAC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPancreas_MiaPaCa2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPancreas_PANC1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nProstate_22RV1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nProstate_PC3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE D\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nModel\n \nCancer type\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA431\n \nEpidermoid\n \n \n \n \n \nH358\n \nNSCLC\n \n \n \n \n \nH292\n \nNSCLC\n \n \n \n \n \nBxPC3\n \nPancreatic\n \n \n \n \n \nPC3\n \nProstate\n \n \n \n \n \nHCT116\n \nColon\n \n \n \n \n \nHCC827\n \nNSCLC\n \n \n \n \n \n(apoptosis/\n \n \n \n \n \nanti-\n \n \n \n \n \nproliferation)\n \n \n \n \n \nBxPC3\n \nPancreatic\n \n \n \n \n \n(apoptosis/\n \n \n \n \n \nanti-\n \n \n \n \n \nproliferation)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA representative protocol for the in vivo experiment is as followed:\n\n\n\n1-10×10\n6 \nhuman cancer cells are implanted subcutaneously to the athymic (nu/nu) mice. When the tumors reach about 100 mm\n3 \nin volume, the mice are treated with the compound by tail vein infusion. Routinely 5 groups (8-12 mice per group) are needed for a typical efficacy study, including one negative control, one positive control, and three testing groups for 3 dose levels of the same compound. Usually a 7-7-5 (on-off-on) regimen is used for one typical study. The tumor size is measured with an electronic caliper and body weight measured with a scale twice weekly. The tumors are removed from euthanized mice at the end of the study. One half of each tumor is frozen in dry ice and stored at −80° C. for PK or Western blot analysis. The other half is fixed with formalin. The fixed tissues are processed, embedded in paraffin and sectioned for immunohistochemistry staining.\n\n\nThe patent and scientific literature referred to herein establishes the knowledge that is available to those with skill in the art.
