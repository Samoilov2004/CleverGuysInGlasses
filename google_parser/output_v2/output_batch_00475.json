Description\n\n\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Applications: 60/894,693 filed on Mar. 14, 2007 and 60/941,699 filed on Jun. 4, 2007.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to spiro (tetracarbon) substituted compounds, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredient, methods for the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis, such as cancers associated with protein tyrosine kinases, to their use as medicaments for use in the production of inhibition of tyrosine kinases reducing effects in warm-blooded animals such as humans.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nReceptor tyrosine kinases are large enzymes that span the cell membrane and possess an extracellular binding domain for growth factors, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular portion that functions as a kinase to phosphorylate a specific tyrosine residue in proteins and hence to influence cell proliferation. Tyrosine kinases may be classified as growth factor receptor (e.g. EGFR, PDGFR, FGFR and erbB2) or non-receptor (e.g. c-src and bcr-abl) kinases. Such kinases may be aberrantly expressed in common human cancers such as breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancers such as colon, rectal or stomach cancer, leukemia, and ovarian, bronchial or pancreatic cancer. Aberrant erbB2 activity has been implicated in breast, ovarian, non-small cell lung, pancreatic, gastric and colon cancers.\n\n\nNormal angiogenesis plays an important role in a variety of processes including embryonic development, wound healing and several components of female reproductive function. Undesirable or pathological angiogenesis has been associated with disease states including diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atheroma. Tumor angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels and their permeability is primarily regulated by (tumor-derived) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which acts via at least two different receptors: VEGF-R1 (Flt-1); and VEGF-R2 (KDR, Flk-1). The VEGF KDR receptor is highly specific for vascular endothelial cells (\nEndocr. Rev. \n1992, 13, 18\n; FASEB J. \n1999, 13, 9).\n\n\nA large number of human tumors, especially gliomas and carcinomas, express high levels of VEGF and its receptors. This has led to the hypothesis that the VEGF released by tumor cells stimulates the growth of blood capillaries and the proliferation of tumor endothelium in a paracrine manner and through the improved blood supply, accelerate tumor growth. Direct evidence of the role of VEGF as a tumor angiogenesis factor in vivo is shown in studies in which VEGF expression or VEGF activity was inhibited. This was achieved with anti-VEGF antibodies, with dominant-negative VEGFR-2 mutants which inhibited signal transduction, and with antisense-VEGF RNA techniques. All approaches led to a reduction in the growth of glioma cell lines or other tumor cell lines in vivo as a result of inhibited tumor angiogenesis.\n\n\nThree principal mechanisms play an important part in the activity of angiogenesis inhibitors against tumors: 1) Inhibition of the growth of vessels, especially capillaries, into vascular resting tumors, with the result that there is no net tumor growth owing to the balance that is achieved between cell death and proliferation; 2) Prevention of the migration of tumor cells owing to the absence of blood flow to and from tumors; and 3) Inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, thus avoiding the paracrine growth-stimulating effect exerted on the surrounding tissue by the endothelial cells which normally line the vessels.\n\n\nThe present invention is based on the discovery of compounds that surprisingly inhibit the effect of VEGF, a property of value in the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability such cancer, diabetes, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposi's, haemangioma, acute and chronic nephropathies, atheroma, arterial restenosis, autoimmune disease, acute inflammation, excessive scar formation and adhesions, lymphoedema, endometriosis, dysfunctional uterine bleeding and ocular diseases with retinal vessel proliferation.\n\n\nIt has now been found that spiro substituted compounds of formula I, described below, are a new class of compounds that have advantageous pharmacological properties and inhibit the activity of protein tyrosine kinases, such as VEGFr, EGFr, c-kit, PDGF, FGF, SRC etc. They may also be irreversible inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases.\n\n\nExamples of compounds that are similar in structure to those of the present invention are disclosed in the following literatures: WO9717329, WO9722596, WO0047212, WO2002032872, WO2004018430, WO2005073224, WO2005080377, WO2005097134, WO2005097137, WO2005114219, WO2005070891, WO05021553, WO2005063739.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to spiro substituted compounds of formula I\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nWherein\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA is selected from direct bond or —N(R′)—;\n\n\nB is selected from direct bond, O, —N(R′)—, —C(═X)— —C(═X)N(R′)—, lower alkylenyl-C(═X)— or lower alkylenyl-C(═X)N(R′)—;\n\n\nX is selected from O or S;\n\n\nR′ is selected from H, halogen, halogeno-lower alkyl, lower alkyl, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkoxyalkoxy, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, amino, alkylamino, alkoxyamino, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, lower aryl, heterocyclyl or lower heterocyclyl;\n\n\nR\n1\n, R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare each independently selected from H, halogen, halogeno-lower alkyl, lower alkyl, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkoxyalkoxy, lower alkenyl, or lower alkynyl;\n\n\nR\n4 \nand R\n5 \nare each independently selected from H, halogen, halogeno-lower alkyl, lower alkyl, hydroxy, lower alkoxy, lower alkoxyalkoxy, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, lower alkyl-OC(═O)—, aryl-OC(═O)—, aryl lower alkylenyl-OC(═O)—, lower alkyl-C(═O)—, aryl —C(═O)—, aryl lower alkylenyl-C(═O)—, lower alkyl-SO\n2\n—, aryl —SO\n2\n—, aryl lower alkylenyl-SO\n2\n—, lower alkyl-C(═O)—, aryl —C(═O)—aryl lower alkylenyl-C(═O)—, lower alkyl-N(R)C(═O)—, aryl —N(R)C(═O)—, or aryl lower alkylenyl-N(R)C(═O)—;

Long term therapy is equally possible as is adjuvant therapy in the context of other treatment strategies, as described above. Other possible treatments are therapy to maintain the patient's status after tumor regression, or even chemopreventive therapy, for example in patients at risk.\n\n\nA compound according to the invention is not only for management of humans, but also for the treatment of other warm-blooded animals, for example of commercially useful animals. Such a compound may also be used as a reference standard in the test systems described above to permit a comparison with other compounds.\n\n\nSalts are especially the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include those described in \nJ. Pharm. Sci., \n1977, 66, 1-19, such as acid addition salts formed with inorganic acid e.g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, nitric or phosphoric acid; and organic acids e.g. succinic, maleic, acetic, fumaric, citic, tartaric, benzoic, p-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic or naphthalenesulfonic acid. Other salts may be used, for example in the isolation or purification of compounds of formula (I) and are included within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention may be in crystalline or non-crystalline form, and, if crystalline, may optionally be hydrated or solvated. This invention includes within its scope stoichiometric hydrates as well as compounds containing variable amount of water.\n\n\nThe invention extents to all isomeric forms including stereoisomers and geometic isomers of the compounds of formula (I) including enantimers and mixtures thereof e.g. racemates.

Those skilled in the art will recognize a wide variety of non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable solvents that may be used to prepare solvates of the compounds of the invention, such as water, ethanol, mineral oil, vegetable oil, and dimethylsulfoxide.\n\n\nThe compounds of general Formula I may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation or spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. Oral administration in the form of a pill, capsule, elixir, syrup, lozenge, troche, or the like is particularly preferred. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intradermal, intravascular (e.g., intravenous), intramuscular, spinal, intrathecal injection or like injection or infusion techniques. In addition, there is provided a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of general Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. One or more compounds of general Formula I may be present in association with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents and/or adjuvants and if desired other active ingredients. The pharmaceutical compositions containing compounds of general Formula I may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsion, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs.\n\n\nCompositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients that are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monosterate or glyceryl distearate may be employed.\n\n\nFormulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.\n\n\nAqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydropropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.\n\n\nOily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredients in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide palatable oral preparations. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.\n\n\nDispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol, anhydrides, for example sorbitan monoleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monoleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.\n\n\nSyrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavoring and coloring agents.\n\n\nThe compounds may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal or vaginal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum or vagina to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parentally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention may also be administered transdermally using methods know to those skilled in the art (see, for example: Chien; “transdermal Controlled Systemic Medications”; Marcel Dekker, Inc.; 1987. Lipp et al. WO 94/04157 3 Mar. 1994).\n\n\nCompounds of general Formula I may be administered parenterally in a sterile medium. The drug, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as local anesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle.\n\n\nFor administration to non-human animals, the composition may also be added to the animal feed or drinking water. It will be convenient to formulate these animal feed and drinking water compositions so that the animal takes in an appropriate quantity of the composition along with its diet. It will also be convenient to present the composition as a premix for addition to the feed or drinking water.\n\n\nFor all regimens of use disclosed herein for compounds of formula I, the daily oral dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.01 to 200 mg/Kg of total body weight. The daily dosage for administration by injection, including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and parenteral injections, and use of infusion techniques will preferably be from 0.01 to 200 mg/Kg of total body weight. The daily rectal dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.01 to 200 mg/Kg of total body weight. The daily vaginal dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.01 to 200 mg/Kg of total body weight. The daily topical dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.01 to 200 mg administered between one to four times daily. The transdermal concentration will preferably be that required to maintain a daily dose of from 0.01 to 200 mg/Kg. The daily inhalation dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.01 to 200 mg/Kg of total body weight.\n\n\nIt will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing therapy.\n\n\nPreferred compounds of the invention will have certain pharmacological properties. Such properties include, but are not limited to oral bioavailability, low toxicity, low serum protein binding and desirable in vitro and in vivo half-lives.\n\n\nAssays may be used to predict these desirable pharmacological properties. Assays used to predict bioavailability include transport across human intestinal cell monolayers, including Caco-2 cell monolayers. Toxicity to cultured hepatocycles may be used to predict compound toxicity. Penetration of the blood brain barrier of a compound in humans may be predicted from the brain levels of the compound in laboratory animals given the compound intravenously.\n\n\nSerum protein binding may be predicted from albumin binding assays. Such assays are described in a review by Oravcova, et al.

Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application is a U.S. National Phase application under 35 U.S.C. §371 of PCT Application No. PCT/JP2008/066525, filed Sep. 12, 2008, which published as WO 2009/038021 A1 on Mar. 26, 2009, and claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §365(b) from Japanese patent application No. JP2007-244731, filed Sep. 21, 2007.\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\nThe present invention is useful in the medical field. More specifically, the 4-sulfonylpiperidine derivative of the invention is useful as a long chain fatty acyl elongase (hereinafter sometimes referred to as LCE) inhibitor for use as a remedy for various kinds of circulatory diseases, neurological diseases, metabolic diseases, reproductive system diseases, digestive diseases, neoplasms, infectious diseases, and the like, or as a herbicide.\n\n\nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\nObesity is a condition where the energy intake is continuously excessive relative to the energy consumption, thereby causing accumulation of neutral fat in fat cells, resulting in remarkably increased body weight over the standard body weight (Eiji Itagaki, \nSTEP Taisha/Naibunpitsu \n(STEP metabolism/endocrine), Kaibashobo, 1\nst\n. Ed., p. 105, 1998). It is known that excessive accumulation of fat causes, for example, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and the like, and that combination a plurality of these factors greatly increases the risk of the onset of atherosclerosis. Such a condition is called metabolic syndrome. Further, hypertriglyceridemia and obesity are known to increase the risk of pneumonia, hepatic dysfunction, cancers such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, and prostatic cancer, emmeniopathy, arthritis, gout, cholecystitis, gastroesophageal reflux, obesity hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome), sleep apnea syndrome, and the like. It is widely known that diabetes often leads to, onset of, for example, angina pectoris, cardiac insufficiency, stroke, claudication, retinopathy, visual loss, renal insufficiency, neuropathy, skin ulcer, infection, and the like [The Merck Manual of Medical Information, 2\nnd \nHome Edition, Merck & Co, 2003].\n\n\nLCE is an enzyme that exists in the endoplasmic reticulum in cells. In the group of enzymes that catalyze the carbon-chain elongation reaction of fatty acids of chain length C\n12 \nor longer, LCE is an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting condensation step. In the mammals, most of fatty acids newly synthesized in vivo have a chain length of C\n16 \nto C\n18\n. Such long chain fatty acids account for more than 90% of the total fatty acids existing in cells. They are important constituents of the membrane, and are also the basic components of the fatty tissue, the greatest energy conservation organ in animals. Synthesis of new fatty acids most likely takes place in the liver, and such synthesis converts excessive glucose in the body into fatty acids. Glucose is converted by glycolysis into pyruvate. Pyruvate is converted in the mitochondria into citrate, and conveyed to the cytosol. ATP citrate lyase in the cytosol produces fatty acids and acetyl-CoA, a precursor of cholesterol. Acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) to form malonyl-CoA. Fatty acid synthase (FAS), a multifunctional enzyme, elongates fatty acids by 2 carbons, using malonyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, and NADPH. The main final product of FAS in the rodents is palmitoyl-CoA having a chain length of C\n16\n, and LCE elongates the carbon chain of such palmitoyl-CoA by further 2 carbons [J. Biol. Chem., 276 (48), 45358-45366, (2001)]. Excessive acceleration of fatty acid synthesis in vivo is known to cause an increase in neutral fat and the like, which thus is responsible for the accumulation of fats. For example, WO 2005/005665 (Patent Document 1) shows a direct relation between LCE and obesity. Moreover, changes in the mouse FACE (LCE) expression level due to food intake have also been reported (Matsuzaka T. et al., J, Lipid Res., 43(6): 911-920 (2002); Nonpatent Document 1).\n\n\nLCE is known to exist also in protozoa and nematodes, and be involved in cell proliferation. For example, it has been disclosed that in trypanosomatid protozoa that cause the African trypanosomiasis (vernacular name: African sleeping sickness), long chain fatty acids are synthesized via the fatty acid elongation pathway involving LCE, and that inhibition of intracellular fatty acid elongation reaction affects the proliferation of trypanosomatid protozoa (Lee S. H. et al., Cell, 126: 691-699 (2006); Nonpatent Document 2).\n\n\nNo compound has been known to have LCE inhibitory effect. Meanwhile, the compound of the invention is a piperidine derivative having a sulfonyl group at the 4-position of piperidine (or piperazine), while no compound has been known with the piperidine (or piperazine) moiety forming a bicyclo ring, wherein an aryl group or the like is bound to the nitrogen atom of the piperidine (or piperazine) through a linker.\n\n\nPatent Document 1: WO 2005/005665 pamphlet\n\n\nNonpatent Document 1: J. Lipid Res., 43 (6), pp. 911-920 (2002)\n\n\nNonpatent Document 2: Cell, 126: pp. 691-699 (2006)\n\n\nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nProblems that the Invention is to Solve\n\n\nThe object of the invention is to provide a novel compound having LCE inhibitory effect.\n\n\nMeans for Solving the Problems\n\n\nAs a result of extensive research, the present inventors found that a specific piperidine (or piperazine) derivative having a sulfonyl group at the 4-position of the piperidine (or piperazine) skeleton has excellent LCE inhibitory effect, and thus accomplished the invention.\n\n\nSpecifically, the invention provides:\n\n\n(1) a compound represented by formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (hereinafter referred to as a “compound of the invention”):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein:\n\n\n\nR\n1 \nrepresents optionally substituted C\n1-6 \nalkyl, optionally substituted C\n3-8 \ncycloalkyl, optionally substituted aryl, or optionally substituted heteroaryl, wherein the C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n3-8 \ncycloalkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl optionally having a substituent selected from the group consisting of halogen, C\n1-6 \nalkyl, halo C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n1-6 \nalkyloxy, and halo C\n1-6 \nalkyloxy;\n\n\nR\n2 \nrepresents optionally substituted phenyl or optionally substituted heteroaryl, wherein the phenyl or heteroaryl optionally having a substituent selected from the group consisting of halogen, C\n1-6 \nalkyl, halo C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n3-8 \ncycloalkyl, C\n1-6 \nalkyloxy, phenyl, and nitrogen-containing heteroaryl;\n\n\nQ represents N or CH;\n\n\nM\n1 \nand M\n2 \neach independently represent a hydrogen atom or C\n1-6 \nalkyl optionally substituted with halogen, or M\n1 \nforms, together with M\n2 \nor M\n3\n, —CH\n2\n— or —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—;

The LCE enzyme activity inhibition test was carried out according to a modification of the method of Moon (J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 276, pp. 45358-45366 (2001)) et al. Specifically, the diluted test compound was added to a 96-well assay plate (Corning, 96-well assay block) at 1.0 μL per well, and then 50 μL of phosphate buffer solution (100 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.5)), 25 μL of substrate solution (100 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.5)), 4.0 μM rotenone, 80 μM fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, 160 μM palmitoyl-CoA 80 μM malonyl-CoA, and 3.5 μM [\n14\nC]-malonyl-CoA (1.92 GBq/mmol, manufactured by Amersham) were added to each well. Further, 25 μL of enzyme solution (100 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.5), 100 μg/mL human LCE) was added thereto. The plate was hermetically closed at the top with a seal, and then incubated with gentle agitation by shaking at 37° C. for 90 minutes. Subsequently, 100 μL of 5N HCl was added to each well, and the assay plate was agitated for 5 minutes at room temperature to stop the enzymatic reaction and also hydrolyze acyl-CoA. Subsequently, the enzymatic reaction solution of each well was adsorbed on each well of a 96-well GF/C filter plate (PerkinElmer, UniFilter 96 GF/C) that had been previously dipped in water. The wells were washed with water to remove unabsorbed malonyl-CoA, and the GF/C filter plate was dried at 50° C. for 60 minutes. Subsequently, 30 μL of scintillator (PerkinElmer, MicroScinti 0) was added to each well, and the plate was sealed at the top. Using a microplate scintillation counter (PerkinElmer, TopCount), the radiation activity of the fixed [\n14\nC] was measured and obtained as the enzyme activity. The human LCE enzyme inhibitory activity of a test compound was calculated based on the radio activity in the well containing test-compound-free DMSO as a control. Compounds of the invention were examined according to this assay. As a result, the compounds inhibited the activity of human LCE. The results are shown in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample No.\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n108\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n92\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n32\n\n\n127\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n33\n\n\n103\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n194\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n36\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n37\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n40\n\n\n125\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds of the invention may be administered orally or parenterally.

Description\n\n\n\n\nPRIORITY TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of European Patent Application No. 09159364.0, filed May 5, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is concerned with isoxazole-pyrazole derivatives having affinity and selectivity for GABA A α5 receptor, their manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as medicaments.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nReceptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA A receptors, which are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily and (2) GABA B receptors, which are members of the G-protein linked receptor family. The GABA A receptor complex which is a membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer is composed principally of α, β and γ subunits.\n\n\nPresently a total number of 21 subunits of the GABA A receptor have been cloned and sequenced. Three types of subunits (α, β and γ) are required for the construction of recombinant GABA A receptors which most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological functions of native GABA A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepine binding site lies between the α and γ subunits. Among the recombinant GABA A receptors, α1β2γ2 mimics many effects of the classical type-I BzR subtypes, whereas α2β2γ2, α3β2γ2 and α5β2γ2 ion channels are termed type-II BzR.\n\n\nIt has been shown by McNamara and Skelton in Psychobiology, 1993, 21:101-108 that the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist β-CCM enhance spatial learning in the Morris watermaze. However, β-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists are proconvulsant or convulsant which prevents their use as cognition enhancing agents in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective within the GABA A receptor subunits, whereas a GABA A α5 receptor partial or full inverse agonist which is relatively free of activity at GABA A α1 and/or α2 and/or α3 receptor can be used to provide a medicament which is useful for enhancing cognition with reduced or without proconvulsant activity. It is also possible to use GABA A α5 inverse agonists which are not free of activity at GABA A α1 and/or α2 and/or α3 receptor but which are functionally selective for α5 containing subunits. However, inverse agonists which are selective for GABA A α5 subunits and are relatively free of activity at GABA A α1, α2 and α3 receptor are preferred.\n\n\nLiterature has been published to establish the link between GABA A α5 subunits and the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of various diseases and disorders of the Central Nervous System, like Neuroscience Letts., 2005, 381,108-13, Neuropsychobiology, 2001, 43(3), 141-44, Amer.

Additional asymmetric centres can be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric centre will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds. The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations can be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry can be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric centre of known absolute configuration. If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds can be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography.\n\n\nSubstituents at a double bond or a ring can be present in cis (═Z—) or trans (=E-) form, unless the stereochemistry is explicitly depicted in the corresponding compound formula I.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutical composition” encompasses a product comprising specified ingredients in pre-determined amounts or proportions, as well as any product that results, directly or indirectly, from combining specified ingredients in specified amounts.

(50000 g; Sorvall, rotor: SM24=20000 rpm). The cell pellets were re-suspended in Krebs-tris buffer and homogenized by polytron for ca. 15 sec on ice. Protein was measured (Bradford method, Bio-Rad) and aliquots of 1 mL were prepared and stored at −80° C.\n\n\nRadioligand binding assays were carried out in a volume of 200 mL (96-well plates) which contained 100 mL of cell membranes, [\n3\nH]flumazenil at a concentration of 1 nM for α1, α2 and α3 subunits and 0.5 nM for α5 subunits and the test compound in the range of 10-10\n−3\n×10\n−6 \nM. Nonspecific binding was defined by 10\n−5 \nM diazepam and typically represented less than 5% of the total binding. Assays were incubated to equilibrium for 1 hour at 4° C. and harvested onto GF/C uni-filters (Packard) by filtration using a Packard harvester and washing with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris; pH 7.5). After drying, filter-retained radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting. Ki values were calculated using Excel-Fit (Microsoft) and are the means of two determinations.\n\n\nThe compounds of the accompanying examples were tested in the above described assay, and the preferred compounds were found to possess a Ki value for displacement of [\n3\nH]flumazenil from α5 subunits of the rat GABA A receptor of 100 nM or less. Most preferred are compounds with a Ki (nM)<35.
