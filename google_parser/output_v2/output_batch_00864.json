The U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention under grant number AG-022559 awarded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to novel bioactive compounds, methods of diagnostic imaging using radiolabeled compounds, and methods of making radiolabeled compounds.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, irreversible memory loss, disorientation, and language impairment. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease of the brain. It is a significant medical problem with a high prevalence in millions of elder people. Major neuropathology observations of postmortem AD brains depict the presence of senile plaques (containing β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregates) and neurofibrillary tangles (highly phosphorylated tau proteins). Currently, there is no definitive imaging method to diagnose AD, except by postmortem biopsy and staining of the brain tissue which demonstrates the senile plaques containing predominantly AB aggregates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral genomic factors have been linked to AD. Familial AD (or early onset AD) has been reported to have mutations in genes encoding β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) (Berezovska, O, A Lleo, L D Herl, et al. “Familial Alzheimer's \ndisease presenilin\n 1 mutations cause alterations in the conformation of presenilin and interactions with amyloid precursor protein.” \nJ Neurosci \n25:3009 (2005); Deng, Y, L Tarassishin, V Kallhoff, et al. “Deletion of \npresenilin\n 1 hydrophilic loop sequence leads to impaired gamma-secretase activity and exacerbated amyloid pathology.” \nJ Neurosci \n26:3845 (2006); Hardy, J, D J Selkoe “The amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease: progress and problems on the road to therapeutics.” \nScience \n297:353 (2002); Selkoe, D J “Alzheimer's disease: genes, proteins, and therapy.” \nPhysiol Rev \n81:741 (2001)). The exact mechanisms of these mutations which lead to the development of AD, are not fully understood; however, the formation of Aβ plaques in the brain is a pivotal event in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmyloidosis is a condition characterized by the accumulation of various insoluble, fibrillar proteins in the tissues of a patient. An amyloid deposit is formed by the aggregation of amyloid proteins, followed by the further combination of aggregates and/or amyloid proteins. Formation of soluble and diffusible Aβ and Aβ aggregates in the brain are now considered the critical events, which produce various toxic effects in neuronal cells leading to the formation of neuritic plaques (Catalano, S M, E C Dodson, D A Henze, et al. “The Role of Amyloid-Beta Derived Diffusible Ligands (ADDLs) in Alzheimer's Disease.” \nCurr Top Med Chem \n6:597 (2006); Hardy, (2002); Jicha, G A, J E Parisi, D W Dickson, et al. “Neuropathologic outcome of mild cognitive impairment following progression to clinical dementia.” \nArch Neurol \n63:674 (2006); Rosenberg, R N “Explaining the cause of the amyloid burden in Alzheimer disease.” \nArch Neurol \n59:1367 (2002); Thal, D R, E Capetillo-Zarate, K Del Tredici, et al. “The development of amyloid beta protein deposits in the aged brain.” \nSci Aging Knowledge Environ \n2006:re1, (2006)). Recent reports have suggested that β-amyloid aggregates, i.e. Aβ plaques, in the brain play a key role in a cascade of events leading to AD. Postmortem examination of AD brain sections reveals abundant senile plaques (SPs) composed of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and numerous neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by filaments of highly phosphorylated tau proteins (for recent reviews and additional citations see Ginsberg, S. D., et al., “Molecular Pathology of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders,” in \nCerebral Cortex: Neurodegenerative and Age\n-\nrelated Changes in Structure and Function of Cerebral Cortex\n, Kluwer Academic/Plenum, NY (1999), pp. 603-654; Vogelsberg-Ragaglia, V., et al., “Cell Biology of Tau and Cytoskeletal Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease,” \nAlzheimer's Disease\n, Lippincot, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa. (1999), pp. 359-372).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the exact mechanisms underlying AD are not fully understood, all pathogenic familial AD (FAD) mutations studied thus far increase production of the more amyloidogenic 42-43 amino-acid long form of the Aβ peptide. Thus, at least in FAD, dysregulation of Aβ production appears to be sufficient to induce a cascade of events leading to neurodegeneration. Indeed, the amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that formation of extracellular fibrillar Aβ aggregates in the brain may be a pivotal event in AD pathogenesis (Selkoe, D. J., “Biology of β-amyloid Precursor Protein and the Mechanism of Alzheimer's Disease,” \nAlzheimer's Disease\n, Lippincot Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa. (1999), pp. 293-310; Selkoe, D. J., \nJ. Am. Med. Assoc. \n283:1615-1617 (2000); Naslund, J., et al., \nJ. Am. Med. Assoc. \n283:1571-1577, (2000); Golde, T. E., et al., \nBiochimica et Biophysica Acta \n1502:172-187 (2000)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSignificant circumstantial evidence suggests that fibrillary Aβ plaques consisting predominately of aggregates of Aβ\n40 \nand Aβ\n42 \npeptides play a major role in AD pathogenesis -“Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis” (Armstrong, R A “Plaques and tangles and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.” \nFolia Neuropathol \n44:1 (2006); Golde, T E “The Abeta hypothesis: leading us to rationally-designed therapeutic strategies for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer disease.” \nBrain Pathol \n15:84 (2005); Hardy, J “Has the amyloid cascade hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease been proved?” \nCurr Alzheimer Res \n3:71 (2006); Hardy (2002); Marchesi, V T “An alternative interpretation of the amyloid Abeta hypothesis with regard to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.” \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n102:9093 (2005)). ApoE4 expression appears to increase the risk of AD (Fryer, J D, J W Taylor, R B DeMattos, et al. “Apolipoprotein E markedly facilitates age-dependent cerebral amyloid angiopathy and spontaneous hemorrhage in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice.” \nJ Neurosci \n23:7889 (2003)). It is likely that amyloid precursor protein (APP) is degraded by several proteases, among which the catabolism reactions of β- and γ-secretases on APP lead to the production of excess Aβ. The excessive burden of Aβ, produced by various normal or abnormal mechanisms, may represent the starting point of neurodegenerative events. The fibrillar aggregates of amyloid peptides, Aβ\n40 \nand Aβ\n42\n, are major metabolic peptides derived from amyloid precursor protein found in senile plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits in AD patients (Xia, W., et al., \nJ. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n97:9299-9304, (2000)). Prevention and reversal of Aβ plaque formation are being targeted as a treatment for this disease (Selkoe, D., J. JAMA 283:1615-1617 (2000); Wolfe, M. S., et al., J. Med. Chem. 41:6-9, 1998; Skovronsky, D. M., and Lee, V. M., \nTrends Pharmacol. Sci. \n21:161-163 (2000)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEarly appraisal of clinical symptoms for diagnosis of AD is often difficult and unreliable (Boss, M A “Diagnostic approaches to Alzheimer's disease.” \nBiochim Biophys Acta \n1502:188 (2000)). Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) imaging of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) for diagnosis and monitoring of patients with AD have been reported (Ishii, K, S Minoshima “PET is better than perfusion SPECT for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease—for.” \nEur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging \n32:1463 (2005); Mega, M S, ID Dinov, L Lee, et al. “Orbital and dorsolateral frontal perfusion defect associated with behavioral response to cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in Alzheimer's disease.” \nJ Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci \n12:209 (2000a); Mega, M S, L Lee, I D Dinov, et al. “Cerebral correlates of psychotic symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.” \nJ Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry \n69:167 (2000b); Tang, B N, S Minoshima, J George, et al. “Diagnosis of suspected Alzheimer's disease is improved by automated analysis of regional cerebral blood flow.” \nEur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging \n31:1487 (2004)). Diagnosis of AD based on regional glucose metabolism in the brain has been evaluated using PET imaging with [\n18\nF]2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG). The overall performance of FDG/PET is favorable for routine clinical evaluation of suspected AD (Frey, K A, S Minoshima, D E Kuhl “Neurochemical imaging of Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative Dementias.” \nQ J Nucl Med \n42:166 (1998); Hoffman, J M, K A Welsh-Bohmer, M Hanson, et al. “FDG PET imaging in patients with pathologically verified d41ementiaj.” \nJ Nucl Med \n41:1920 (2000); Minoshima, S “Imaging Alzheimer's disease: clinical applications.” \nNeuroimaging Clin N Am \n13:769 (2003); Minoshima, S, B Giordani, S Berent, et al. “Metabolic reduction in the posterior cingulate cortex in very early Alzheimer's disease.” \nAnn Neurol \n42:85 (1997); Phelps, M E “PET: the merging of biology and imaging into molecular imaging.” \nJ Nucl Med \n41:661 (2000); Silverman, D H S, M E Phelps “Invited Commentary: Evaluating Dementia Using PET: How Do We Put into Clinical Perspective What We Know to Date?” \nJ Nucl Med \n41:1929 (2000)). While imaging rCBF and glucose metabolism may have some use in AD patients, none of these modalities provide any information on the presence or quantity of Aβ aggregates in the brain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious approaches in trying to inhibit the production and reduce the accumulation of fibrillar Aβ in the brain are currently being evaluated as potential therapies for AD (Skovronsky, D. M. and Lee, V. M., \nTrends Pharmacol. Sci. \n21:161-163 (2000); Vassar, R., et al., \nScience \n286:735-741, 1999; Wolfe, M. S., et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n41:6-9, 1998; Moore, C. L., et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n43:3434-3442 (2000); Findeis, M. A., \nBiochimica et Biophysica Acta \n1502:76-84, 2000; Kuner, P., Bohrmann, et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n275:1673-1678 (2000)). It is therefore of interest to develop ligands that specifically bind fibrillar Aβ aggregates. Since extracellular SPs are accessible targets, these new ligands could be used as in vivo diagnostic tools and as probes to visualize the progressive deposition of Aβ in studies of AD amyloidogenesis in living patients. Development of Aβ plaque-specific imaging agents has been reported previously (for review see Blennow, K, H Zetterberg “Pinpointing plaques with PIB.” \nNat Med \n12:753 (2006b); Huddleston, D E, S A Small “Technology Insight: imaging amyloid plaques in the living brain with positron emission tomography and MRI.” \nNat Clin Pract Neurol \n1:96 (2005); Mathis, C A, Y Wang, W E Klunk “Imaging β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the aging human brain.” \nCurr Pharm Des \n10:1469 (2004); Nichols, L, V W Pike, L Cai, et al. “Imaging and in vivo quantitation of beta-amyloid: an exemplary biomarker for Alzheimer's disease?” \nBiol Psychiatry \n59:940 (2006); Schmidt, B, H A Braun, R Narlawar “Drug development and PET-diagnostics for Alzheimer's disease.” \nCurr Med Chem \n12:1677 (2005)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPotential ligands for detecting Aβ aggregates in the living brain must cross the intact blood-brain barrier. Thus brain uptake can be improved by using ligands with relatively smaller molecular size and increased lipophilicity. Highly conjugated thioflavins (S and T) are commonly used as dyes for staining the Aβ aggregates in the AD brain (Elhaddaoui, A., et al., \nBiospectroscopy \n1:351-356 (1995)). To this end, several interesting approaches for developing fibrillar Aβ aggregate-specific ligands have been reported (Ashburn, T. T., et al., \nChem. Biol. \n3:351-358 (1996); Han, G., et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n118:4506-4507 (1996); Klunk, W. E., et al., \nBiol. Psychiatry \n35:627 (1994); Klunk, W. E., et al., \nNeurobiol. Aging \n16:541-548 (1995); Klunk, W. E., et al., \nSociety for Neuroscience Abstract \n23:1638 (1997); Mathis, C. A., et al., \nProc. XIIth Intl. Symp. Radiopharm. Chem\n., Uppsala, Sweden: 94-95 (1997); Lorenzo, A. and Yankner, B. A., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n91:12243-12247 (1994); Zhen, W., et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n42:2805-2815 (1999); Klunk, W. E., et al., \nJ. Histochem. Cytochem. \n37:1273-1281 (1989)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe approach has been based on highly conjugated dyes, such as Congo Red and Chrysamine G (CG) (Dezutter, N A, R J Dom, T J de Groot, et al. “\n99m\nTc-MAMA-chrysamine G, a probe for beta-amyloid protein of Alzheimer's disease.” \nEur J Nucl Med \n26:1392 (1999); Klunk, W E, M L Debnath, A M Koros, et al. “Chrysamine-G, a lipophilic analogue of Congo red, inhibits Aβ-induced toxicity in PC12 cells.” \nLife Sci \n63:1807 (1998); Klunk, W E, M L Debnath, J W Pettegrew “Small-molecule beta-amyloid probes which distinguish homogenates of Alzheimer's and control brains.” \nBiol Psychiatry \n35:627 (1994)). Thioflavin S and T have also been used in fluorescent staining of plaques and tangles in postmortem AD brain sections (Elhaddaoui, A, E Pigorsch, A Delacourte, et al. “Competition of congo red and thioflavin S binding to amyloid sites in Alzheimer's diseased tissue.” \nBiospectroscopy \n1:351 (1995)). More abbreviated forms of Chrysamine G (CG), such as styrylbenzenes, have been reported as fluorescent dyes for staining amyloid aggregates (Link, C D, C J Johnson, V Fonte, et al. “Visualization of fibrillar amyloid deposits in living, transgenic \nCaenorhabditis elegans \nanimals using the sensitive amyloid dye, X-34.” \nNeurobiol Aging \n22:217 (2001); Styren, S D, R L Hamilton, G C Styren, et al. “X-34, a fluorescent derivative of Congo Red: a novel histochemical stain for Alzheimer's disease pathology.” \nJ Histochem Cytochem \n48:1223 (2000)). They are useful research tools but these charged and bulky agents do not cross intact blood-brain barrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA highly lipophilic tracer, [\n18\nF]FDDNP, for binding both tangles (mainly composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein) and plaques (containing Aβ protein aggregates) has been reported. (Shoghi-Jadid K, et al., \nAm J Geriatr Psychiatry. \n10:24-35 (2002); Barrio, J R, S-C Huang, G Cole, et al. “PET imaging of tangles and plaques in Alzheimer's disease with a highly hydrophobic probe.” \nJ Lab Compds Radiopharm \n42 Suppl. 1:S194, (1999a); Barrio, J R, S C Huang, G M Cole, et al. “PET imaging of tangles and plaques in Alzheimer's disease.” \nJ Nucl Med \n40:70 P, (1999b)). Preliminary studies in humans suggested that [\n18\nF]FDDNP showed a higher retention in regions of brain suspected of having tangles and plaques (Kepe, V, J R Barrio, S C Huang, et al. “Serotonin 1A receptors in the living brain of Alzheimer's disease patients.” \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n103:702 (2006); Shoghi-Jadid, K, J R Barrio, V Kepe, et al. “Exploring a mathematical model for the kinetics of beta-amyloid molecular imaging probes through a critical analysis of plaque pathology.” \nMol Imaging Biol \n8:151 (2006); Shoghi-Jadid, K, J R Barrio, V Kepe, et al. “Imaging beta-amyloid fibrils in Alzheimer's disease: a critical analysis through simulation of amyloid fibril polymerization.” \nNucl Med Biol \n32:337 (2005); Shoghi-Jadid, K, G W Small, E D Agdeppa, et al. “Localization of neurofibrillary tangles and beta-amyloid plaques in the brains of living patients with Alzheimer disease: Binding characteristics of radiofluorinated 6-dialkylamino-2-naphthylethylidene derivatives as positron emission tomography imaging probes for beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer disease.” \nAm J Geriatr Psychiatry \n10:24, (2002)). Using positron-emission tomography (PET), it was reported that this tracer specifically labeled deposits of plaques and tangles in nine AD patients and seven comparison subjects. (Nordberg A. \nLancet Neurol. \n3:519-27 (2004)). Using a novel pharmacokinetic analysis procedure called the relative residence time of the brain region of interest versus the pons, differences between AD patients and comparison subjects were demonstrated. The relative residence time was significantly higher in AD patients. This is further complicated by an intriguing finding that FDDNP competes with some NSAIDs for binding to Aβ fibrils in vitro and to Aβ plaques ex vivo (Agdeppa E D, et al. 2001; Agdeppa E D, et al., \nNeuroscience. \n2003; 117:723-30).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA neutral and lipophilic thioflavin derivative, [\n11\nC]6-OH-BTA-1 (PIB), showed excellent brain penetration and initial brain uptake, and displayed a high binding affinity to Aβ plaques (K\ni\n=2.8 nM) (Klunk, W E, Y Wang, G-f Huang, et al. “Uncharged thioflavin-T derivatives bind to amyloid-beta protein with high affinity and readily enter the brain.” \nLife Sci \n69:1471 (2001); Mathis, C A, B J Bacskai, STBMC Kajdasz, et al. “A lipophilic thioflavin-T derivative for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid in brain.” \nBioorg Med Chem Lett \n12:295 (2002a); Mathis, C A, Y Wang, W E Klunk “Imaging b-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the aging human brain.” \nCurr Pharm Des \n10:1469 (2004); (Mathis C A, et al., \nCurr Pharm Des. \n10:1469-92 (2004); Mathis C A, et al., \nArch. Neurol. \n62:196-200 (2005)). Contrary to that observed for [\n18\nF]FDDNP, [\n11\nC]6-OH-BTA-1 binds specifically to fibrillar Aβ in vivo. Patients with diagnosed mild AD showed marked retention of [\n11\nC]6-OH-BTA-1 in the cortex, known to contain large amounts of amyloid deposits in AD. In the AD patient group, [\n11\nC]6-OH-BTA-1 retention was increased most prominently in the frontal cortex. Large increases also were observed in parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices and in the striatum. [\n11\nC]6-OH-BTA-1 retention was equivalent in AD patients and comparison subjects in areas known to be relatively unaffected by amyloid deposition (such as subcortical white matter, pons, and cerebellum). Fluorinated PIB and related neutral thioflavin derivatives, such as BTA-1, have also been reported (Mathis, C A, DP Holt, Y Wang, et al. “\n18\nF-labeled thioflavin-T analogs for amyloid assessment.” \nJ Nucl Med \n43:166 P, (2002b)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the past few years, successful PET imaging study in AD patients with [\n11\nC]PIB has been reported (Klunk, W E, B J Lopresti, M D Ikonomovic, et al. “Binding of the positron emission tomography tracer Pittsburgh compound-B reflects the amount of amyloid-beta in Alzheimer's disease brain but not in transgenic mouse brain.” \nJ Neurosci \n25:10598, (2005); Lopresti, B J, W E Klunk, C A Mathis, et al. “Simplified Quantification of Pittsburgh Compound B Amyloid Imaging PET Studies: A Comparative Analysis.” \nJ Nucl Med \n46:1959 (2005); Mathis, C A, W E Klunk, J C Price, et al. “Imaging technology for neurodegenerative diseases: progress toward detection of specific pathologies.” \nArch Neurol \n62:196 (2005); Price, J C, W E Klunk, B J Lopresti, et al. “Kinetic modeling of amyloid binding in humans using PET imaging and Pittsburgh Compound-B.” \nJ Cereb Blood Flow Metab \n25:1528 (2005)). Recently, [\n11\nC]PIB has been used in testing a limited number of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Buckner, R L, A Z Snyder, B J Shannon, et al. “Molecular, structural, and functional characterization of Alzheimer's disease: evidence for a relationship between default activity, amyloid, and memory.” \nJ Neurosci \n25:7709 (2005); Nordberg, A “PET imaging of amyloid in Alzheimer's disease.” \nLancet Neurol \n3:519 (2004); Price, J C, W E Klunk, B J Lopresti, et al. “Kinetic modeling of amyloid binding in humans using PET imaging and Pittsburgh Compound-B.” \nJ Cereb Blood Flow Metab \n25:1528, (2005)). Using PIB/PET to study the relationship between Aβ plaque burden and AD neurological measurements, the results seem to suggest that there are some MCI cases that convert to AD, while those with lower PIB uptake in the cortex appear to have less propensity to convert to AD (Engler, H, A Forsberg, O Almkvist, et al. “Two-year follow-up of amyloid deposition in patients with Alzheimer's disease.” \nBrain \n(2006); Mintun, M A, G N Larossa, Y I Sheline, et al. “[\n11\nC]PIB in a nondemented population: potential antecedent marker of Alzheimer disease.” \nNeurology \n67:446 (2006); Price, J C, S K Ziolko, L A Weissfeld, et al. “[O-15] Water and PIB PET imaging in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.” \nJ Nucl Med:\n75p (abstract) (2006); Rentz, D M, J A Becker, E Moran, et al. “Amyloid imaging in AD, MCI, and highly intelligent older adults with Pittsburgh Compound-B (PIB).” \nJ Nucl Med:\n289p (abstract) (2006); Villemagne, V L, S Ng, S J Gong, et al. “\n11\nC-PIB PET imaging in the differential diagnosis of dementia.” \nJ Nucl Med:\n74p (abstract), (2006)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, another \n11\nC labeled Aβ plaque-targeting probe, a stilbene derivative, [\n11\nC]SB-13, has been studied. In vitro binding using the [\n3\nH]SB-13 suggests that the compound showed excellent binding affinity and binding can be clearly measured in the cortical gray matter, but not in the white matter of AD cases. (Kung M-P, et al., \nBrain Res. \n1025:98-105 (2004). There was a very low specific binding in cortical tissue homogenates of control brains. The K\nd \nvalues of [\n3\nH]SB-13 in AD cortical homogenates were 2.4±0.2 nM. High binding capacity and comparable values were observed (14-45 μmol/mg protein) (Id.). As expected, in AD patients [\n11\nC]SB-13 displayed a high accumulation in the frontal cortex (presumably an area containing a high density of Aβ plaques) in mild to moderate AD patients, but not in age-matched control subjects. (Verhoeff N P, et al., \nAm J Geriatr Psychiatry. \n12:584-95, (2004)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, there have been reports on using an in vivo multiphoton optical imaging technique for invasive imaging of senile plaques in transgenic mice (by opening the skull) (Bacskai, B J, S T Kajdasz, R H Christie, et al. “Imaging of amyloid-beta deposits in brains of living mice permits direct observation of clearance of plaques with immunotherapy.” \nNat Med \n7:369, (2001)). Additional improvements on developing near-infrared optical imaging agents have been reported (Bacskai, B J, G A Hickey, J Skoch, et al. “Four-dimensional multiphoton imaging of brain entry, amyloid binding, and clearance of an amyloid-beta ligand in transgenic mice.” \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n100:12462 (2003); Hintersteiner, M, A Enz, P Frey, et al. “In vivo detection of amyloid-beta deposits by near-infrared imaging using an oxazine-derivative probe.” \nNat Biotechnol \n23:577 (2005); Nesterov, E E, J Skoch, B T Hyman, et al. “In vivo optical imaging of amyloid aggregates in brain: design of fluorescent markers.” \nAngew Chem Int Ed Engl \n44:5452 (2005)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are several potential benefits of imaging Aβ aggregates in the brain. The imaging technique will improve diagnosis by identifying potential patients with excess Aβ plaques in the brain; therefore, they may be likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. It will also be useful to monitor the progression of the disease. When anti-plaque drug treatments become available, imaging Aβ plaques in the brain may provide an essential tool for monitoring treatment. Thus, a simple, noninvasive method for detecting and quantitating amyloid deposits in a patient has been eagerly sought. Presently, detection of amyloid deposits involves histological analysis of biopsy or autopsy materials. Both methods have drawbacks. For example, an autopsy can only be used for a postmortem diagnosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the role of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease, the presence of amyloid deposits has been shown in diseases such as Mediterranean fever, Muckle-Wells syndrome, idiopathetic myeloma, amyloid polyneuropathy, amyloid cardiomyopathy, systemic senile amyloidosis, amyloid polyneuropathy, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, Down's syndrome, Scrapie, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, Kuru, Gerstamnn-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, Isolated atrial amyloid, β\n2\n-microglobulin amyloid in dialysis patients, inclusion body myositis, β\n2\n-amyloid deposits in muscle wasting disease, and Islets of Langerhans diabetes Type II insulinoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe direct imaging of amyloid deposits in vivo is difficult, as the deposits have many of the same physical properties (e.g., density and water content) as normal tissues. Attempts to image amyloid deposits using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer-assisted tomography (CAT) have been disappointing and have detected amyloid deposits only under certain favorable conditions. In addition, efforts to label amyloid deposits with antibodies, serum amyloid P protein, or other probe molecules have provided some selectivity on the periphery of tissues, but have provided for poor imaging of tissue interiors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt would be useful to have a noninvasive technique for imaging and quantitating amyloid deposits in a patient. In addition, it would be useful to have compounds that inhibit the aggregation of amyloid proteins to form amyloid deposits and a method for determining a compound's ability to inhibit amyloid protein aggregation.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel compounds of Formulas I and II.

Many ligands are known in the art and are suitable for use as a labeling moiety for compounds of Formula II. Those of skill in the art will understand that such ligands provide a convenient way to label compounds and the invention is not limited to particular ligands, many of which are interchangeable. Preferably, this ligand is a tri- or tetradentate ligand, such as N\n3\n, N\n2\nS, NS\n2\n, N\n4 \nand those of the N\n2\nS\n2 \ntype, such as:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein, \n indicates a possible point(s) of attachment of the ligand to the backbone of the amyloid binding structure, j is 0, 1 or 2; and U is two adjacent carbons on the aromatic ring of the backbone or —C(R\n35\nR\n36\n)C(R\n37\nR\n38\n)—; wherein R\nh\n, in each instance, and R\n35\n, R\n36\n, R\n37 \nand R\n38 \nare independently hydrogen, hydroxy, amino, methylamino, dimethylamino, (C\n1-4\n)alkoxy, (C\n1-4\n)alkyl, and hydroxy(C\n1-4\nalkyl. The preferred values for these particular R groups are hydrogen and C\n1-4 \nalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above ligand can be substituted at other positions if available:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther potentially available positions are represented by R\n25\n, R\n26\n, R\n27\n, R\n28\n, R\n29\n, R\n30\n, R\n31\n, R\n32\n, R\n33 \nand R\n34\n. One or two of these R group(s) will not be available when the ligand is attached to the backbone at that particular position(s). When available, these R groups are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydroxy, amino, methylamino, dimethylamino, (C\n1-4\n)alkoxy, (C\n1-4\n)alkyl, and hydroxy(C\n1-4\n)alkyl. Preferably, the R groups are hydrogen or (C\n1-4\n)alkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth R\nP \ngroups can be hydrogen, or can be any of the variety of protecting groups available for sulfur, including methoxymethyl, methoxyethoxymethyl, p-methoxybenzyl or benzyl. Sulfur protecting groups are described in detail in, for example, Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M., \nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis, \n2nd Edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York (1991). Protecting group R\nP \ncan be removed by appropriate methods well known in the art of organic synthesis, such as trifluoroacetic acid, mercuric chloride or sodium in liquid ammonia. In the case of Lewis acid labile groups, including acetamidomethyl and benzamidomethyl, R\nP \ncan be left intact. Labeling of the ligand with technetium in this case will cleave the protecting group, rendering the protected diaminedithiol equivalent to the unprotected form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe metal ligand moiety is capable of complexing with a radiometal, such as \n99m\nTc, to form a metal chelate as exemplified by the following structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, other radiometals can be complexed with the ligand, such as rhenium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred values of R\n21 \ninclude hydroxy, C\n1-4 \nalkoxy, —NHCO(C\n1-4 \nalkyl) and NR′R″, wherein R′ and R″ are as described above.

Suzuki coupling of compound 8 with para-iodonitrobenzene in toluene followed by deprotection of TBS group with TBAF(1M in THF) gave compound 9 (Yield: 81.8%). The alkylation of the hydroxy group of compound 9 with either 1-chloro-2-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethane (30)\na \nor 2-(2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethoxy)ethanol was conducted using Biotage Initiated microwave system (180° C., 10 min, high absorption level) to obtain compound 10a (Yield: 89%) or 10b (Yield: 81%) respectively. The nitro group of 10a,b was reduced to amine with stannous chloride in ethanol to give 11a,b (Yield: 76%, 81%). The dimethylated derivative 12a was obtained by reacting 11a with paraformaldehyde at the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride in acetic acid at 96% yield. Monomethylation of 11a,b was achieved using paraformaldehyde, sodium methoxide and sodium borohydride to afford 13a,b (Yield: 72%, 88%). The hydroxy group of 13b was protected with TBS before protecting the monomethyl amino group with Boc. TBS was then removed by TBAF (1M in THF) to obtain compound 14b (Yield: 57% for three steps based on 13b), which was converted into mesylate using methansulfonyl chloride and triethyl amine in dichloromethane to give compound 14c (Yield: 90%), which was used as the labeling precursor for preparing [\n18\nF]12a.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBromonaphthalen-2-amine (15) was obtained by converting the hydroxy group of 6-bromonaphthalen-2-ol into amine. (Yield: 94%). Suzuki coupling of 15 with 4-hydroxyphenylboronic acid gave compound 16 (Yield: 71%), which was barely soluble in methanol and was purified by washing off organic impurities with methanol. The hydroxy group of 16 was then alkylated with either 1-chloro-2-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethane (30)\na \nor 2-(2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethoxy)ethanol under the same microwave condition for preparing of 10a,b to gave 17a,b (Yield: 72%, 73%, respectively). Same dimethylation and monomethylation approaches for making the dimethylamino and monomethylamino phenylnaphthalene derivatives were applied on 17a,b to give the corresponding dimethylamino-naphthalene-phen derivatives 18a,b (Yield: 48%, 50%) and monomethyl-naphthalene-phen derivatives 19a,b (Yield: 84%, 94%). To make the mesylate 20c, compound 19b was first converted into 20b (Yield: 66.4%) through a similar procedure used for preparing 14c: TBS protection of the hydroxyl group, Boc protection of the methyl amino group and then remove the TBS protection group with TBAF(1M)/THF solution. The free OH group of 20b was then reacted with methansulfonyl chloride to give 20c (Yield: 95%).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther Phen-Naphthalene or Naphthalene-Phen derivatives (23, 24, 25, 26, 28) were synthesized using Suzuki coupling in DME or a mix-solvent of toluene and ethanol with corresponding starting materials, which were either commercial available or prepared as showing in Scheme 3 (Yield: 34%-71%).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hydroxyl group of 6-bromo-2-hydroxy-quinolin was alkylated by 2-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethanol or by triethylene glycol with potassium tert-butoxide at 80° C. in acetonitrile to afford 31a (74%) or 31b (91%) respectively. Suzuki coupling of 31a or 31b was performed in DME at 70° C. with 4-dimethylamino-boronic acid, palladium tetrakistriphenylphosphine and sodium carbonate to give compound 32a (30%) or 32b (94%) respectively. Tosylation of 32b with tosyl chloride in pyridine was not successful, but using tosyl anhydride in dichloromethane at the presence of triethyl amine and catalytic amount of DMAP, 32b was successfully converted into 32c in a very good yield (83.4%). Suzuki coupling of 31a or 31b with 4-aminophenylboronic acid pinacolate, was conducted in toluene at the presence of palladium tetrakistriphenylphosphine, tetrabutyl ammonium bromide, and sodium carbonate to yield 33a (75%) or 33b (89%) respectively. Monomethylation of 33a, b using paraformaldehyde, sodium methoxide and sodiumborohydride obtained 34a, b (Yield: 72%, 91.5%). 34b was then converted into 35b through the following steps: TBS protection of the hydroxyl group, Boc protection of the methyl amino group and then remove the TBS protection group. The free hydroxy group of 35b was converted into tosylate by reacting with tosyl chloride in pyridine at room temperature to yield 35c (43%).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo make F-18 labeled Phen-Nap, Nap-Phen and Phen-Quinoline derivatives [\n18\nF]13a, [\n18\nF]19a, [\n18\nF]32a and [\n18\nF]34a, compound 14c, 20c, 32a and 35c were used as the corresponding precursors (Scheme 6). Each of the mesylate or tosylate 14c, 20c, 32c and 35c was mixed with [\n18\nF]/F\n−\n, Kryptofix[2.2.2], potassium carbonate in DMSO and applied for microwave irradiation at 50 Watts, maximum 100° C., for 60 sec. For making [\n18\nF]32a, the crude product was purified by semi-preparative HPLC immediately after the labeling reaction. For making [\n18\nF] 13a, [\n18\nF] 19a, [\n18\nF]34a, the crude product was added 10% HCl and irradiated with microwave at 50 Watts, maximum 100° C., for 60 sec to remove Boc protecting group and then neutralized with sodium hydroxide followed by semi-preparative HPLC purification. The preparation of [\n18\nF]13a, [\n18\nF]19a, [\n18\nF]32a and [\n18\nF]34a took about 50-70 min, the radiochemical yield was about 30% (decay corrected), radiochemical purity was >99% and the specific activity (SA) was estimated to be 500-2000 Ci/mmol at the end of synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is also directed at a method of imaging amyloid deposits. When the compounds of this invention are to be used as imaging agents, they must be labeled with suitable radioactive isotopes, such as radioactive halogens, radioactive metals and other detectable radioactive atoms such as \n11\nC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegarding radiohalogens, \n125\nI-isotopes are useful for laboratory testing, but they will generally not be useful for actual diagnostic purposes because of the relatively long half-life (60 days) and low gamma-emission (30-65 Key) of \n125\nI. The isotope \n123\nI has a half life of thirteen hours and gamma energy of 159 KeV, and it is therefore expected that labeling of ligands to be used for diagnostic purposes would be with this isotope or \n18\nF (half life of 2 hours). Other isotopes which may be used include \n131\nI. Suitable bromine isotopes include \n77\nBr and \n76\nBr.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can also contain a radioactive isotope of carbon as the radiolabel. This refers to a compound that comprises one or more radioactive carbon atoms, preferably \n11\nC, with a specific activity above that of the background level for that atom. It is well known, in this respect, that naturally occurring elements are present in the form of varying isotopes, some of which are radioactive isotopes. The radioactivity of the naturally occurring elements is a result of the natural distribution or abundance of these isotopes, and is commonly referred to as a background level. The carbon labeled compounds of the present invention have a specific activity that is higher than the natural abundance, and therefore above the background level. The composition claimed herein comprising a carbon-labeled compound(s) of the present invention will have an amount of the compound such that the composition can be used for tracing, imaging, radiotherapy, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable radioactive metals are disclosed herein. A particularly useful radioactive metal is Tc-99m. Tc-99m complexes can be prepared as follows. A small amount of non-radiolabeled compound (1-2 mg) is dissolved in 100 μL EtOH and mixed with 200 μL HCl (1 N) and 1 mL Sn-glucoheptonate solution (containing 8-32 μg SnCl\n2 \nand 80-320 μg Na-glucoheptonate, pH 6.67) and 50 μL EDTA solution (0.1 N). [\n99m\nTc]Pertechnetate (100-200 μL; ranging from 2-20 mCi) saline solution are then added. The reaction is heated for 30 min at 100° C., then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture is analyzed on TLC (EtOH:conc. NH\n3 \n9:1) for product formation and purity check. The mixture can be neutralized with phosphate buffer to pH 5.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further relates to a method of preparing a technetium-99m complex according to the present invention by reacting technetium-99m in the form of a pertechnetate in the presence of a reducing agent and optionally a suitable chelator with an appropriate Ch-containing compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reducing agent serves to reduce the Tc-99m pertechnetate which is eluted from a molybdenum-technetium generator in a physiological saline solution. Suitable reducing agents are, for example, dithionite, formamidine sulphinic acid, diaminoethane disulphinate or suitable metallic reducing agents such as Sn(II), Fe(II), Cu(I), Ti(III) or Sb(III). Sn(II) has proven to be particularly suitable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the above-mentioned complex-forming reaction, technetium-99m is reacted with an appropriate compound of the invention as a salt or in the form of technetium bound to comparatively weak chelators. In the latter case the desired technetium-99m complex is formed by ligand exchange. Examples of suitable chelators for the radionuclide are dicarboxylic acids, such as oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, orthophtalic acid, malic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, salicylic acid or derivatives of these acids; phosphorus compounds such as pyrophosphates; or enolates. Citric acid, tartaric acid, ascorbic acid, glucoheptonic acid or a derivative thereof are particularly suitable chelators for this purpose, because a chelate of technetium-99m with one of these chelators undergoes the desired ligand exchange particularly easily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most commonly used procedure for preparing [Tc\nv\nO]\n+3\nN\n2\nS\n2 \ncomplexes is based on stannous (II) chloride reduction of [\n99m\nTc]pertechnetate, the common starting material. The labeling procedure normally relies on a Tc-99m ligand exchange reaction between Tc-99m (Sn)-glucoheptonate and the N\n2\nS\n2 \nligand. Preparation of stannous (II) chloride and preserving it in a consistent stannous (II) form is critically important for the success of the labeling reaction. To stabilize the air-sensitive stannous ion it is a common practice in nuclear medicine to use a lyophilized kit, in which the stannous ion is in a lyophilized powder form mixed with an excess amount of glucoheptonate under an inert gas like nitrogen or argon. The preparation of the lyophilized stannous chloride/sodium glucoheptonate kits ensures that the labeling reaction is reproducible and predictable. The N\n2\nS\n2 \nligands are usually air-sensitive (thiols are easily oxidized by air) and there are subsequent reactions which lead to decomposition of the ligands. The most convenient and predictable method to preserve the ligands is to produce lyophilized kits containing 100-500 μg of the ligands under argon or nitrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe radiohalogenated compounds of this invention lend themselves easily to formation from materials which could be provided to users in kits. Kits for forming the imaging agents can contain, for example, a vial containing a physiologically suitable solution of an intermediate of Formula I or II in a concentration and at a pH suitable for optimal complexing conditions. The user would add to the vial an appropriate quantity of the radioisotope, e.g., Na\n123\nI, and an oxidant, such as hydrogen peroxide. The resulting labeled ligand may then be administered intravenously to a patient, and receptors in the brain imaged by means of measuring the gamma ray or photo emissions therefrom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the radiopharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can be prepared easily and simply, the preparation can be carried out readily by the user. Therefore, the present invention also relates to a kit, comprising:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) A non-radiolabeled compound of the invention, the compound optionally being in a dry condition; and also optionally having an inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or auxiliary substances added thereto; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) a reducing agent and optionally a chelator;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein ingredients (1) and (2) may optionally be combined; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \nfurther wherein instructions for use with a prescription for carrying out the above-described method by reacting ingredients (1) and (2) with technetium-99m in the form of a pertechnetate solution may be optionally included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable reducing agents and chelators for the above kit have been listed above. The pertechnetate solution can be obtained by the user from a molybdenum-technetium generator. Such generators are available in a number of institutions that perform radiodiagnostic procedures. As noted above the ingredients (1) and (2) may be combined, provided they are compatible. Such a monocomponent kit, in which the combined ingredients are preferably lyophilized, is excellently suitable to be reacted by the user with the pertechnetate solution in a simple manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen desired, the radioactive diagnostic agent may contain any additive such as pH controlling agents (e.g., acids, bases, buffers), stabilizers (e.g., ascorbic acid) or isotonizing agents (e.g., sodium chloride).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art are familiar with the various ways to detect labeled compounds for imaging purposes. For example, positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can be used to detect radiolabeled compounds. The label that is introduced into the compound can depend on the detection method desired. Those skilled in the art are familiar with PET detection of a positron-emitting atom, such as \n18\nF. However, the present invention is also directed to specific compounds described herein where the \n18\nF atom is replaced with a non-radiolabeled fluorine atom. Those skilled in the art are familiar with SPECT detection of a photon-emitting atom, such as \n123\nI or \n99m\nTc. However, the present invention is also directed to specific compounds described herein where the \n123\nI atom is replaced with a non-radiolabeled iodine atom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe radioactive diagnostic agent should have sufficient radioactivity and radioactivity concentration which can assure reliable diagnosis. The desired level of radioactivity can be attained by the methods provided herein for preparing compounds of Formula I, I′, II or II′. The imaging of amyloid deposits can also be carried out quantitatively so that the amount of amyloid deposits can be determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of the key prerequisites for an in vivo imaging agent of the brain is the ability to cross the intact blood-brain barrier after a bolus iv injection. In the first step of the present method of imaging, a labeled compound of Formula I, I′, II or II′ is introduced into a tissue or a patient in a detectable quantity. The compound is typically part of a pharmaceutical composition and is administered to the tissue or the patient by methods well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the compound can be administered either orally, rectally, parenterally (intravenous, by intramuscularly or subcutaneously), intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, intravesically, locally (powders, ointments or drops), or as a buccal or nasal spray.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment of the invention, the labeled compound is introduced into a patient in a detectable quantity and after sufficient time has passed for the compound to become associated with amyloid deposits, the labeled compound is detected noninvasively inside the patient. In another embodiment of the invention, a labeled compound of Formula I, I′, II or II′ is introduced into a patient, sufficient time is allowed for the compound to become associated with amyloid deposits, and then a sample of tissue from the patient is removed and the labeled compound in the tissue is detected apart from the patient. In a third embodiment of the invention, a tissue sample is removed from a patient and a labeled compound of Formula I is introduced into the tissue sample. After a sufficient amount of time for the compound to become bound to amyloid deposits, the compound is detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe administration of the labeled compound to a patient can be by a general or local administration route. For example, the labeled compound may be administered to the patient such that it is delivered throughout the body. Alternatively, the labeled compound can be administered to a specific organ or tissue of interest. For example, it is desirable to locate and quantitate amyloid deposits in the brain in order to diagnose or track the progress of Alzheimer's disease in a patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a method of inhibiting amyloid plaque aggregation. For example, a compound of the present invention is tested in an established in-vitro immunoblot assay for its ability to inhibit the formation of AB oligomers and fibrils (Yang F, Liim G P, Begum A N et al. Curcumin inhibits formation of amyloid β oligomers and fibrils, binds plaques, and reduces amyloid in-vivo. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n280:5892-5901, 2005). Curcumin, a natural molecule serves as positive control. Phen-napthalene and phen-quinoline compounds of the present invention are able to inhibit the aggregation of Aβ in a manner similar to Curcumin at concentrations of 1-100 μM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a method of inhibiting the aggregation of amyloid proteins to form amyloid deposits, by administering to a patient an amyloid inhibiting amount of a compound of Formula I, I′, II or II′.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention can be administered to a patient at dosage levels in the range of about 0.1 to about 1,000 mg per day. For a normal human adult having a body weight of about 70 kg, a dosage in the range of about 0.01 to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day is sufficient. The specific dosage used, however, can vary. For example, the dosage can depend on a number of factors including the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the pharmacological activity of the compound being used. The determination of optimum dosages for a particular patient is well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art are readily able to determine an amyloid inhibiting amount by simply administering a compound of Formula I or II to a patient in increasing amounts until the growth of amyloid deposits is decreased or stopped. The rate of growth can be assessed using imaging as described above or by taking a tissue sample from a patient and observing the amyloid deposits therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with one or more other drugs in the treatment, prevention, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of diseases or conditions for which the compounds of the present invention have utility, where the combination of the drugs together are safer or more effective than either drug alone. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with one or more other drugs that treat, prevent, control, ameliorate, or reduce the risk of side effects or toxicity of the compounds of the present invention. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefore, contemporaneously or sequentially with the compounds of the present invention. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to the compounds of the present invention. The combinations may be administered as part of a unit dosage form combination product, or as a kit or treatment protocol wherein one or more additional drugs are administered in separate dosage forms as part of a treatment regimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of combinations of the compounds of the present invention with other drugs in either unit dose or kit form include combinations with: anti-Alzheimer's agents, for example beta-secretase inhibitors or gamma-secretase inhibitors; HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors; NSAIDs including ibuprofen; vitamin E; anti-amyloid antibodies, including humanized monoclonal antibodies; CB-1 receptor antagonists or CB-1 receptor inverse agonists; antibiotics such as doxycycline and rifampin; N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, such as memantine; cholinesterase inhibitors such as galantamine, rivastigmine, donepezil and tacrine; growth hormone secretagogues such as ibutamoren, ibutamoren mesylate, and capromorelin; histamine H\n3 \nantagonists; AMPA agonists; PDE IV inhibitors; GABA\na \ninverse agonists; neuronal nicotinic agonists; or other drugs that affect receptors or enzymes that either increase the efficacy, safety, convenience, or reduce unwanted side effects or toxicity of the compounds of the present invention. The foregoing list of combinations is illustrative only and not intended to be limiting in any way.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” as used herein refers to those carboxylate salts or acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. The term “salts” refers to the relatively nontoxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. Also included are those salts derived from non-toxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids, for example acetic acid, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic and alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, and aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed. Further representative salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, nitrate, acetate, oxalate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, borate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, naphthylate mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactiobionate and laurylsulphonate salts, propionate, pivalate, cyclamate, isethionate, and the like.

The process by which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response is referred to as signal transduction. Over the past decades, cascades of signal transduction events have been elucidated and found to play a central role in a variety of biological responses. Defects in various components of signal transduction pathways have been found to account for a vast number of diseases, including numerous forms of cancer, inflammatory disorders, metabolic disorders, vascular and neuronal diseases (Gaestel et al. \nCurrent Medicinal Chemistry \n(2007) 14:2214-2234).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinases represent a class of important signaling molecules. Kinases can generally be classified into protein kinases and lipid kinases, and certain kinases exhibit dual specificities. Protein kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins and/or themselves (i.e., autophosphorylation). Protein kinases can be generally classified into three major groups based upon their substrate utilization: tyrosine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine residues (e.g., erb2, PDGF receptor, EGF receptor, VEGF receptor, src, abl), serine/threonine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on serine and/or threonine residues (e.g., mTorC1, mTorC2, ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Akt), and dual-specificity kinases which phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine, serine and/or threonine residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLipid kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids. These enzymes, and the resulting phosphorylated lipids and lipid-derived biologically active organic molecules, play a role in many different physiological processes, including cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and differentiation. Certain lipid kinases are membrane associated and they catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids contained in or associated with cell membranes. Examples of such enzymes include phosphoinositide(s) kinases (such as PI3-kinases, PI4-Kinases), diacylglycerol kinases, and sphingosine kinases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) signaling pathway is one of the most highly mutated systems in human cancers. PI3K signaling is also a key factor in many other diseases in humans. PI3K signaling is involved in many disease states including allergic contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, disorders related to diabetic complications, and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPI3Ks are members of a unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3′-OH group on phosphatidylinositols or phosphoinositides. The PI3K family comprises 15 kinases with distinct substrate specificities, expression patterns, and modes of regulation (Katso et al., 2001). The class I PI3Ks (p110α, p110β, p110δ, and p110γ) are typically activated by tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP\n3\n), which engages downstream effectors such as those in the Akt/PDK1 pathway, mTOR, the Tec family kinases, and the Rho family GTPases. The class II and III PI3-Ks play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P2. The PIKKs are protein kinases that control cell growth (mTORC1) or monitor genomic integrity (ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, and hSmg-1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe production of PIP\n3 \ninitiates potent growth and survival signals. In some epithelial cancers the PI3K pathway is activated by direct genetic mutation. As PI3K signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation and differentiation, inhibition of this pathway is believed to be beneficial in hyperproliferative diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDownstream mediators of the PI3K signal transduction pathway include Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Akt posseses a plckstrin homology (PH) domain that bind PIP3, leading to Akt kinase activation. Akt phosphorylates many substrates and is a central downstream effector of PI3K for diverse cellular responses. Full activation of Akt typically requires phosphorylation of T308 in the activation loop and S473 in a hydrophobic motif One important function of Akt is to augment the activity of mTOR, through phosphorylation of TSC2 and other mechanisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nmTOR is a serine-threonine kinase related to the lipid kinases of the PI3K family. mTOR has been implicated in a wide range of biological processes including cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility and survival. Disregulation of the mTOR pathway has been reported in various types of cancer. mTOR is a multifunctional kinase that integrates growth factor and nutrient signals to regulate protein translation, nutrient uptake, autophagy, and mitochondrial function.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nmTOR exists in two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 contains the raptor subunit and mTORC2 contains rictor. These complexes are differentially regulated, and have distinct substrate specificities and rapamycin sensitivity. For example, mTORC1 phosphorylates S6 kinase (S6K) and 4EBP1, promoting increased translation and ribosome biogenesis to facilitate cell growth and cell cycle progression. S6K also acts in a feedback pathway to attenuate PI3K/Akt activation. mTORC2 is generally insensitive to rapamycin. mTORC2 is though to modulate growth factor signaling by phosphorylating the C-terminal hydrophobic motif of some AGC kinases such as Akt. In many cellular contexts, mTORC2 is required for phosphorylation of the S473 site of Akt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOver the past decade, mTOR has drawn considerable attention due to its role in cell growth control and its involvement in human diseases. mTor has been implicated in a wide range of disorders including but not limited to cancer, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders. It has been shown that mTOR modulates many fundamental biological processes including transcription, translation, autophagy, actin organization and ribosome biogenesis by integrating intracellular and extracellular signals, such as signals mediated by growth factors, nutrients, energy levels and cellular stress.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs such, kinases particularly protein kinases such as mTor and Akt, as well as lipid kinases such as PI3Ks are prime targets for drug development. The present invention addresses this need in the art by providing a new class of kinase inhibitors.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect of the invention, compounds are

Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions may occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention. It is intended that the appended claims define the scope of the invention and that methods and structures within the scope of these claims and their equivalents be covered thereby\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All patents and publications referred to herein are incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used in the specification and claims, the singular form “a”, “an” and “the” include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” refers to that amount of a compound described herein that is sufficient to effect the intended application including but not limited to disease treatment, as defined below. The therapeutically effective amount may vary depending upon the intended application (in vitro or in vivo), or the subject and disease condition being treated, e.g., the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the disease condition, the manner of administration and the like, which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The term also applies to a dose that will induce a particular response in target cells, e.g. reduction of platelet adhesion and/or cell migration. The specific dose will vary depending on the particular compounds chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, whether it is administered in combination with other compounds, timing of administration, the tissue to which it is administered, and the physical delivery system in which it is carried.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “treatment” or “treating,” or “palliating” or “ameliorating” is used interchangeably. These terms refer to an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including but not limited to a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated. Also, a therapeutic benefit is achieved with the eradication or amelioration of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that an improvement is observed in the subject, notwithstanding that the subject may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For prophylactic benefit, the compositions may be administered to a subject at risk of developing a particular disease, or to a subject reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though a diagnosis of this disease may not have been made.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “therapeutic effect,” as that term is used herein, encompasses a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit as described above. A prophylactic effect includes delaying or eliminating the appearance of a disease or condition, delaying or eliminating the onset of symptoms of a disease or condition, slowing, halting, or reversing the progression of a disease or condition, or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “co-administration,” “administered in combination with,” and their grammatical equivalents, as used herein, encompass administration of two or more agents to an animal so that both agents and/or their metabolites are present in the subject at the same time. Co-administration includes simultaneous administration in separate compositions, administration at different times in separate compositions, or administration in a composition in which both agents are present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to salts derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art and include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like, when the molecule contains an acidic functionality; and when the molecule contains a basic functionality, salts of organic or inorganic acids, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, tartrate, mesylate (methane sulfonate), ethane sulfonate, acetate, maleate, oxalate, phosphate, and the like. In a compound with more than one basic moiety, more than one of the basic moieties may be converted to the salt form, including but not limited to a bis- or tris-salt. Alternatively, a compound having more than one basic moiety may form a salt at only one of the basic moieties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “antagonist” and “inhibitor” are used interchangeably, and they refer to a compound having the ability to inhibit a biological function of a target protein, whether by inhibiting the activity or expression of the target protein. Accordingly, the terms “antagonist” and “inhibitors” are defined in the context of the biological role of the target protein. While preferred antagonists herein specifically interact with (e.g. bind to) the target, compounds that inhibit a biological activity of the target protein by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target protein is a member are also specifically included within this definition. A preferred biological activity inhibited by an antagonist is associated with the development, growth, or spread of a tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “agonist” as used herein refers to a compound having the ability to initiate or enhance a biological function of a target protein, whether by inhibiting the activity or expression of the target protein. Accordingly, the term “agonist” is defined in the context of the biological role of the target polypeptide. While preferred agonists herein specifically interact with (e.g. bind to) the target, compounds that initiate or enhance a biological activity of the target polypeptide by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target polypeptide is a member are also specifically included within this definition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “agent” or “biologically active agent” refers to a biological, pharmaceutical, or chemical compound or other moiety. Non-limiting examples include a simple or complex organic or inorganic molecule, a peptide, a protein, an oligonucleotide, an antibody, an antibody derivative, antibody fragment, a vitamin derivative, a carbohydrate, a toxin, or a chemotherapeutic compound. Various compounds can be synthesized, for example, small molecules and oligomers (e.g., oligopeptides and oligonucleotides), and synthetic organic compounds based on various core structures. In addition, various natural sources can provide compounds for screening, such as plant or animal extracts, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Signal transduction” is a process during which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response. A modulator of a signal transduction pathway refers to a compound which modulates the activity of one or more cellular proteins mapped to the same specific signal transduction pathway. A modulator may augment (agonist) or suppress (antagonist) the activity of a signaling molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “anti-cancer agent”, “anti-tumor agent” or “chemotherapeutic agent” refers to any agent useful in the treatment of a neoplastic condition. One class of anti-cancer agents comprises chemotherapeutic agents. “Chemotherapy” means the administration of one or more chemotherapeutic drugs and/or other agents to a cancer patient by various methods, including intravenous, oral, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravesical, subcutaneous, transdermal, buccal, or inhalation or in the form of a suppository.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “cell proliferation” refers to a phenomenon by which the cell number has changed as a result of division. This term also encompasses cell growth by which the cell morphology has changed (e.g., increased in size) consistent with a proliferative signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “selective inhibition” or “selectively inhibit” refers to a biologically active agent refers to the agent's ability to preferentially reduce the target signaling activity as compared to off-target signaling activity, via direct or indirect interaction with the target.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“mTorC1 and/or mTorC2 activity” as applied to a biologically active agent refers to the agent's ability to modulate signal transduction mediated by mTorC1 and/or mTorC2. For example, modulation of mTorC1 and/or mTorC2 activity is evidenced by alteration in signaling output from the PI3K/Akt/mTor pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “B-ALL” as used herein refers to B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Subject” refers to an animal, such as a mammal, for example a human. The methods described herein can be useful in both human therapaeutics and veterinary applications. In some embodiments, the subject is a mammal, and in some embodiments, the subject is human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Radiation therapy” means exposing a subject, using routine methods and compositions known to the practitioner, to radiation emitters such as alpha-particle emitting radionuclides (e.g., actinium and thorium radionuclides), low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation emitters (i.e. beta emitters), conversion electron emitters (e.g. strontium-89 and samarium-153-EDTMP, or high-energy radiation, including without limitation x-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “anti-cancer agent”, “anti-tumor agent” or “chemotherapeutic agent” refers to any agent useful in the treatment of a neoplastic condition. One class of anti-cancer agents comprises chemotherapeutic agents. “Chemotherapy” means the administration of one or more chemotherapeutic drugs and/or other agents to a cancer patient by various methods, including intravenous, oral, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravesical, subcutaneous, transdermal, buccal, or inhalation or in the form of a suppository.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Prodrug” is meant to indicate a compound that may be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to a biologically active compound described herein. Thus, the term “prodrug” refers to a precursor of a biologically active compound that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, e.g., Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs (1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam). A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al., “Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,” A.C.S. Symposium Series, Vol. 14, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated in full by reference herein. The term “prodrug” is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of an active compound, as described herein, may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent active compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of a hydroxy functional group, or acetamide, formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “in vivo” refers to an event that takes place in a subject's body.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “in vitro” refers to an event that takes places outside of a subject's body. For example, an in vitro assay encompasses any assay run outside of a subject assay. In vitro assays encompass cell-based assays in which cells alive or dead are employed. In vitro assays also encompass a cell-free assay in which no intact cells are employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise stated, the connections of compound name moieties are at the rightmost recited moiety. That is, the substituent name starts with a terminal moiety, continues with any linking moieties, and ends with the linking moiety. For example, hetarylthio C\n1-4 \nalkyl has a heteroaryl group connected through a thio sulfur to a C\n1-4 \nalkyl radical that connects to the chemical species bearing the substituent. This condition does not apply where a formula such as, for example “-L-C\n1-10 \nalkyl-C\n3-8 \ncycloalkyl” is represented. In such case, the terminal group is a C\n3-8 \ncycloalkyl group attached to a linking C \n1-10 \nalkyl moiety which is attached to an element L, which is itself connected to the chemical species bearing the substituent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of a hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by \n13\nC- or \n14\nC-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (\n3\nH), iodine-125 (\n125\nI) or carbon-14 (\n14\nC). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, for example, “C\n1-4\nalkyl” is used to mean an alkyl having 1-4 carbons—that is, 1, 2, 3, or 4 carbons in a straight or branched configuration. In all embodiments of this invention, the term “alkyl” includes both branched and straight chain alkyl groups, or cyclic hydrocarbon groups, or a combination thereof. Alkyl groups are fully saturated, unsubstituted or substituted,and can include di- and multivalent radicals, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e. C\n1\n-C\n10 \nmeans one to ten carbons and C\n2\n-C\n10 \nmeans two to ten carbons). Typical alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, isooctyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, octadecyl, eicosyl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “halo” or “halogen” refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “haloalkyl” refers to an alkyl group substituted with one or more halo groups, for example chloromethyl, 2-bromoethyl, 3-iodopropyl, trifluoromethyl, perfluoropropyl, 8-chlorononyl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “acyl” refers to the structure —C(═O)—R, in which R is a general substituent variable such as, for example R\n1 \ndescribed above.

An acyl moiety is unsubstituted or is substituted on R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise specified, the term “cycloalkyl” refers to a 3-8 carbon cyclic aliphatic ring structure that is unsubstituted or substituted with, for example, alkyl, hydroxy, oxo, or halo, such as cyclopropyl, methylcyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, 2-hydroxycyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 4-chlorocyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “C\n1-10\nalkyl-C\n3-8\ncycloalkyl” is used to describe an alkyl group, branched or straight chain and containing 1 to 10 carbon atoms, attached to a linking cycloalkyl group which contains 3 to 8 carbons, such as for example, 2-methyl cyclopropyl, and the like. Either portion of the moiety is unsubstituted or substituted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “bicycloalkyl” refers to a structure consisting of two cycloalkyl moieties, unsubstituted or substituted, that have two or more atoms in common. If the cycloalkyl moieties have exactly two atoms in common they are said to be “fused”. Examples include, but are not limited to, bicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl, perhydronaphthyl, and the like. If the cycloalkyl moieties have more than two atoms in common they are said to be “bridged”. Examples include, but are not limited to, bicyclo[3.2.1]heptyl (“norbornyl”), bicyclo[2.2.2]octyl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “heteroatom” or “ring heteroatom” is meant to include oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), and silicon (Si).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroalkyl,” by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon radical, or combinations thereof, consisting of at least one carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, P, Si and S, and wherein the nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) O, N, P and S and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. The alkyl portion of the moiety is unsubstituted or substituted. Examples include, but are not limited to, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—O—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—N(CH\n3\n)—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—S—CH\n2\n—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n, —S(O)—CH\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—S(O)\n2\n—CH\n3\n, —CH═CH—O—CH\n3\n, —Si(CH\n3\n)\n3\n, —CH\n2\n—CH═N—OCH\n3\n, —CH═CH—N(CH\n3\n)—CH\n3\n, O—CH\n3\n, —O—CH\n2\n—CH\n3\n, and —CN. Up to two or three heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, —CH\n2\n—NH—OCH\n3 \nand —CH\n2\n—O—Si(CH\n3\n)\n3\n. Similarly, the term “heteroalkylene” by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified, but not limited by, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—S—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— and —CH\n2\n—S—CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—NH—CH\n2\n—. For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxo, alkylenedioxo, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula —C(O)OR′— represents both —C(O)OR′— and —R′OC(O)—. As described above, heteroalkyl groups, as used herein, include those groups that are attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom, such as —C(O)R′, —C(O)NR′, —NR′R″, —OR′, —SR′, and/or —SO\n2\nR′. Where “heteroalkyl” is recited, followed by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups, such as —NR′R″ or the like, it will be understood that the terms heteroalkyl and —NR′R″ are not redundant or mutually exclusive. Rather, the specific heteroalkyl groups are recited to add clarity. Thus, the term “heteroalkyl” should not be interpreted herein as excluding specific heteroalkyl groups, such as —NR′R″ or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroalkylaryl” refers to a heteroalkyl group as defined above which is attached to an aryl group, and may be attached at a terminal point or through a branched portion of the heteroalkyl, for example, an benzyloxymethyl moiety. Either portion of the moiety is unsubstituted or substituted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroalkylheteroaryl” refers likewise to a heteroalkyl group which is attached to a hetaryl moiety, for example, an ethoxymethylpyridyl group. Either portion of the moiety is unsubstituted or substituted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroalkyl-heterocyclyl ” refers to a heteroalkyl group as defined above, which is attached to a heterocyclic group, for example, 4(3-aminopropyl)-N-piperazinyl.

The lack of substantial cross-reactivity with other non-mTor protein kinases can be evidenced by, e.g., at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or higher kinase activity retained when the compound of the invention is applied to the protein kinase at a concentration of 1 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM or higher.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more compounds of the invention selectively inhibits both mTor activity with an IC50 value of about 100 nM, 50 nM, 10 nM, 5 nM, 100 pM, 10 pM or even 1 pM, or less as ascertained in an in vitro kinase assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more compounds of the invention inhibits phosphorylation of Akt (S473) and Akt (T308) more effectively than rapamycin when tested at a comparable molar concentration in an in vitro kinase assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more compounds of the invention competes with ATP for binding to ATP-binding site on mTorC1 and/or mTorC2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more compounds of the invention are capable of inhibiting and/or otherwise modulating cellular signal transduction via one or more protein kinases or lipid kianses disclosed herein. For example, one or more compounds of the invention are capable of inhibiting or modulating the output of a signal transduction pathway. Output of signaling transduction of a given pathway can be measured by the level of phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, fragmentation, reduction, oxidation of a signaling molecule in the pathway of interest. In another specific embodiment, the output of the pathway may be a cellular or phenotypic output (e.g. modulating/inhibition of cellular proliferation, cell death, apoptosis, autophagy, phagocytocis, cell cycle progression, metastases, cell invasion, angiogenesis, vascularization, ubiquitination, translation, transcription, protein trafficking, mitochondrial function, golgi function, enodplasmic reticular function, etc). In some embodiments, one or more compounds of the invention are capable of, by way of example, causing apoptosis, causing cell cycle arrest, inhibiting cellular proliferation, inhibiting tumor growth, inhibiting angiogenesis, inhibiting vascularization, inhibiting metastases, and/or inhibiting cell invasion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more compounds of the invention causes apoptosis of said cell or cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle can be arrested at the G0/G1 phase, S phase, and/or G2/M phase by the subject compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more compounds of the invention including but not limited to the compounds listed in Table 1 are capable of inhibiting cellular proliferation.

In some cases, the compounds of the invention may inhibit PC3 cell proliferation in vitro or in an in vivo model such as a xenograft mouse model. In some cases, in vitro cultured PC3 cell proliferation may be inhibited with an IC\n50 \nof less than 100 nM, 75 nM, 50 nM, 25 nM, 15 nM, 10 nM, 5 nM, 3 nM, 2 nM, 1 nM, 0.5 nM, 0.1 nM or less by one or more compounds of the invention listed in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, phosphorylation of AKT may be inhibited with an IC\n50 \nof less than 100 nM, 75 nM, 50 nM, 25 nM, 15 nM, 10 nM, 5 nM, 3 nM, 2 nM, 1 nM, 0.5 nM, 0.1 nM or less by one or more compounds of the invention listed in Table 1 Inhibition of phosphorylation of AKT may be a partially or completely blocked by the addition of human whole blood. In some cases, the one or more compounds of the invention listed in Table 1 exhibit specific binding and/or inhibition of mTOR as evidenced by a small (e.g. less than about 0.5-fold, 1-fold, 2-fold, or 3-fold) increase in IC\n50 \nfor inhibition of AKT phosphorylation of cells cultured in whole blood as compared to standard culture media (\ne.g. DMEM\n 10%FBS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some cases, proliferation of primary tumors derived from subjects (e.g. cancer patients) can be inhibited by a compound of the invention as shown by in vitro assays, or in vivo models (e.g. using the subjects' tumor cells for generating a xenograft mode).

The tumor cells that can be inhibited by the compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to pancreatic, renal (kidney), bone, nasopharyngeal, gastric, stomach, ovarian, oral, breast, blood, prostate, rectal, colon, colorectal, blial, neural, lung, and dermal cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the compounds of the invention are effective in blocking cell proliferation signals in cells deficient in PTEN activity but expressing PI3Ka. In some cases, cell proliferation signalling may be inhibited by one or more compounds of the invention including but not limited to those shown in Table 1 as evidenced by Western blot analysis of phosphorylation of proteins such as AKT (phosphorylation at T308 or S473), 4EBP1 (phosphorylation at S65), S6 (phosphorylation at S240/244), FOXO1 (phosphorylation at T24/3a T32), GSK3I3 (phosphorylation at S9), PRAS40 (phosphorylation at T246), or MAPK phosphorylation. In some cases, the compounds of the invention can inhibit phosphorylation of any one of these targets to a greater degree than rapamycin under the conditions tested. In other cases, the compounds of the invention can inhibit phosphorylation of signaling proteins and suppress proliferation of cells containing these signaling proteins but are resistant to existing chemotherapeutic agents including but not limited to rapamycin, Gleevec, dasatinib, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, anthracyclines, plant alkaloids, topoisomerase inhibitors and other antitumor agents disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the compounds of the invention including but not limited to those shown in Table 1, may inhibit tumor cells comprising a wide range of activating or tumor-causing mutations.

For example, in the treatment of adult humans, dosages from 0.01 to 1000 mg, from 0.5 to 100 mg, from 1 to 50 mg per day, and from 5 to 40 mg per day are examples of dosages that may be used. An exemplary dosage is 10 to 30 mg per day. The exact dosage will depend upon the route of administration, the form in which the compound is administered, the subject to be treated, the body weight of the subject to be treated, and the preference and experience of the attending physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA pharmaceutical composition of the invention typically contains an active ingredient (e.g., a compound) of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or coordination complex thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers, including but not limited to inert solid diluents and fillers, diluents, sterile aqueous solution and various organic solvents, permeation enhancers, solubilizers and adjuvants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDescribed below are non-limiting exemplary pharmaceutical compositions and methods for preparing the same.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration. In some embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration containing a compound of the invention, and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the invention provides a solid pharmaceutical composition for oral administration containing\n. \n(i) an effective amount of a compound of the invention; optionally (ii) an effective amount of a second agent; and (iii) a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments, the composition further contains: (iv) an effective amount of a third agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may be a liquid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral consumption. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules, a solution, or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier, which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient such as, but not limited to, a binder, a lubricant, an inert diluent, and/or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, water may be added (e.g., 5%) in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long- term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and/or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition may be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions may be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the compositions for an oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations (such as suspensions, solutions, and elixirs) or aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations, in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example, suitable carriers include powders, capsules, and tablets, with the solid oral preparations. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisintegrants may be used in the compositions of the invention to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant may produce tablets which may disintegrate in the bottle. Too little may be insufficient for disintegration to occur and may thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient(s) from the dosage form. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient(s) may be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used may vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration, and may be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant, may be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums or mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl laureate, agar, or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel, a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica, or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added, in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the active ingredient therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various combinations thereof\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, hydrophilic surfactants, lipophilic surfactants, and mixtures thereof. That is, a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants may be employed, a mixture of lipophilic surfactants may be employed, or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant may be employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable hydrophilic surfactant may generally have an HLB value of at least 10, while suitable lipophilic surfactants may generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non-ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (” HLB″ value). Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic, and have greater solubility in oils, while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic, and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10, as well as anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly, lipophilic (i.e., hydrophobic) surfactants are compounds having an HLB value equal to or less than about 10. However, HLB value of a surfactant is merely a rough guide generally used to enable formulation of industrial, pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHydrophilic surfactants may be either ionic or non-ionic.

This can be especially important for compositions for non- oral use, e.g., compositions for injection. A solubilizer may also be added to increase the solubility of the hydrophilic drug and/or other components, such as surfactants, or to maintain the composition as a stable or homogeneous solution or dispersion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of suitable solubilizers include, but are not limited to, the following: alcohols and polyols, such as ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, benzyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butanediols and isomers thereof, glycerol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, transcutol, dimethyl isosorbide, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyvinylalcohol, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and other cellulose derivatives, cyclodextrins and cyclodextrin derivatives; ethers of polyethylene glycols having an average molecular weight of about 200 to about 6000, such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol PEG ether (glycofurol) or methoxy PEG ; amides and other nitrogen-containing compounds such as 2-pyrrolidone, 2-piperidone, 8-caprolactam, N-alkylpyrrolidone, N-hydroxyalkylpyrrolidone, N-alkylpiperidone, N-alkylcaprolactam, dimethylacetamide and polyvinylpyrrolidone; esters such as ethyl propionate, tributylcitrate, acetyl triethylcitrate, acetyl tributyl citrate, triethylcitrate, ethyl oleate, ethyl caprylate, ethyl butyrate, triacetin, propylene glycol monoacetate, propylene glycol diacetate, ε-caprolactone and isomers thereof, 6-valerolactone and isomers thereof, ≢\n2\n-butyrolactone and isomers thereof; and other solubilizers known in the art, such as dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl isosorbide, N-methyl pyrrolidones, monooctanoin, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMixtures of solubilizers may also be used.

The amount of a given solubilizer may be limited to a bioacceptable amount, which may be readily determined by one of skill in the art. In some circumstances, it may be advantageous to include amounts of solubilizers far in excess of bioacceptable amounts, for example to maximize the concentration of the drug, with excess solubilizer removed prior to providing the composition to a subject using conventional techniques, such as distillation or evaporation. Thus, if present, the solubilizer can be in a weight ratio of 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%, or up to about 200% by weight, based on the combined weight of the drug, and other excipients. If desired, very small amounts of solubilizer may also be used, such as 5%, 2%, 1% or even less. Typically, the solubilizer may be present in an amount of about 1% to about 100%, more typically about 5% to about 25% by weight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe composition can further include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable additives and excipients. Such additives and excipients include, without limitation, detackifiers, anti-foaming agents, buffering agents, polymers, antioxidants, preservatives, chelating agents, viscomodulators, tonicifiers, flavorants, colorants, odorants, opacifiers, suspending agents, binders, fillers, plasticizers, lubricants, and mixtures thereof\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, an acid or a base may be incorporated into the composition to facilitate processing, to enhance stability, or for other reasons. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable bases include amino acids, amino acid esters, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium aluminum silicate, synthetic aluminum silicate, synthetic hydrocalcite, magnesium aluminum hydroxide, diisopropylethylamine, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, triethanolamine, triethylamine, triisopropanolamine, trimethylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) and the like.

Salts of polyprotic acids, such as sodium phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, and sodium dihydrogen phosphate can also be used. When the base is a salt, the cation can be any convenient and pharmaceutically acceptable cation, such as ammonium, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and the like. Example may include, but not limited to, sodium, potassium, lithium, magnesium, calcium and ammonium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable acids are pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic acids. Examples of suitable inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydriodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.

In some embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for injection containing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for injection. Components and amounts of agents in the compositions are as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration by injection include aqueous or oil suspensions, or emulsions, with sesame oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs, mannitol, dextrose, or a sterile aqueous solution, and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous solutions in saline are also conventionally used for injection. Ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like (and suitable mixtures thereof), cyclodextrin derivatives, and vegetable oils may also be employed. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, for the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the compound of the present invention in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients as enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, certain desirable methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for topical (e.g., transdermal) delivery. In some embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for transdermal delivery containing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for transdermal delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions of the present invention can be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, or liquid forms suitable for local or topical administration, such as gels, water soluble jellies, creams, lotions, suspensions, foams, powders, slurries, ointments, solutions, oils, pastes, suppositories, sprays, emulsions, saline solutions, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-based solutions. In general, carriers with higher densities are capable of providing an area with a prolonged exposure to the active ingredients. In contrast, a solution formulation may provide more immediate exposure of the active ingredient to the chosen area.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients, which are compounds that allow increased penetration of, or assist in the delivery of, therapeutic molecules across the stratum corneum permeability barrier of the skin. There are many of these penetration-enhancing molecules known to those trained in the art of topical formulation. Examples of such carriers and excipients include, but are not limited to, humectants (e.g., urea), glycols (e.g., propylene glycol), alcohols (e.g., ethanol), fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid), surfactants (e.g., isopropyl myristate and sodium lauryl sulfate), pyrrolidones, glycerol monolaurate, sulfoxides, terpenes (e.g., menthol), amines, amides, alkanes, alkanols, water, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother exemplary formulation for use in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices (“patches”). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of a compound of the present invention in controlled amounts, either with or without another agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,023,252, 4,992,445 and 5,001,139. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for inhalation. Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a face mask tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices that deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther pharmaceutical compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions may also be prepared from compositions described herein and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients suitable for sublingual, buccal, rectal, intraosseous, intraocular, intranasal, epidural, or intraspinal administration. Preparations for such pharmaceutical compositions are well-known in the art. See, e.g., See, e.g., Anderson, Philip O.; Knoben, James E.; Troutman, William G, eds., \nHandbook of Clinical Drug Data\n, Tenth Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2002; Pratt and Taylor, eds., \nPrinciples of Drug Action, \nThird Edition, Churchill Livingston, New York, 1990; Katzung, ed., \nBasic and Clinical Pharmacology, \nNinth Edition, McGraw Hill, 20037ybg; Goodman and Gilman, eds., \nThe Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics\n, Tenth Edition, McGraw Hill, 2001; \nRemingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n20th Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins., 2000; Martindale, \nThe Extra Pharmacopoeia, \nThirty-Second Edition (The Pharmaceutical Press, London, 1999); all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the compounds or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular, intraperitoneal or infusion), topical (e.g. transdermal application), rectal administration, via local delivery by catheter or stent or through inhalation. Compounds can also abe administered intraadiposally or intrathecally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of the compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to 7 g/day, preferably about 0.05 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, e.g. bydividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in a single dose. Typically, such administration will be by injection, e.g., intravenous injection, in order to introduce the agent quickly. However, other routes may be used as appropriate. A single dose of a compound of the invention may also be used for treatment of an acute condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in multiple doses. Dosing may be about once, twice, three times, four times, five times, six times, or more than six times per day. Dosing may be about once a month, once every two weeks, once a week, or once every other day. In another embodiment a compound of the invention and another agent are administered together about once per day to about 6 times per day. In another embodiment the administration of a compound of the invention and an agent continues for less than about 7 days. In yet another embodiment the administration continues for more than about 6, 10, 14, 28 days, two months, six months, or one year. In some cases, continuous dosing is achieved and maintained as long as necessary.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the compounds of the invention may continue as long as necessary. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered for more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, or 28 days. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered for less than 28, 14, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 day. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered chronically on an ongoing basis, e.g., for the treatment of chronic effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn effective amount of a compound of the invention may be administered in either single or multiple doses by any of the accepted modes of administration of agents having similar utilities, including rectal, buccal, intranasal and transdermal routes, by intra-arterial injection, intravenously, intraperitoneally, parenterally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, orally, topically, or as an inhalant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of the invention may also be delivered via an impregnated or coated device such as a stent, for example, or an artery-inserted cylindrical polymer. Such a method of administration may, for example, aid in the prevention or amelioration of restenosis following procedures such as balloon angioplasty. Without being bound by theory, compounds of the invention may slow or inhibit the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall which contribute to restenosis. A compound of the invention may be administered, for example, by local delivery from the struts of a stent, from a stent graft, from grafts, or from the cover or sheath of a stent. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is admixed with a matrix. Such a matrix may be a polymeric matrix, and may serve to bond the compound to the stent. Polymeric matrices suitable for such use, include, for eample, lactone-based polyesters or copolyesters such as polylactide, polycaprolactonglycolide, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides, polyaminoacids, polysaccharides, polyphosphazenes, poly (ether-ester) copolymers (e.g. PEO-PLLA); polydimethylsiloxane, poly(ethylene-vinylacetate), acrylate-based polymers or copolymers (e.g. polyhydroxyethyl methylmethacrylate, polyvinyl pyrrolidinone), fluorinated polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene and cellulose esters. Suitable matrices may be nondegrading or may degrade with time, releasing the compound or compounds. Compounds of the invention may be applied to the surface of the stent by various methods such as dip/spin coating, spray coating, dip-coating, and/or brush-coating. The compounds may be applied in a solvent and the solvent may be allowed to evaporate, thus forming a layer of compound onto the stent. Alternatively, the compound may be located in the body of the stent or graft, for example in microchannels or micropores. When implanted, the compound diffuses out of the body of the stent to contact the arterial wall. Such stents may be prepared by dipping a stent manufactured to contain such micropores or microchannels into a solution of the compound of the invention in a suitable solvent, followed by evaporation of the solvent. Excess drug on the surface of the stent may be removed via an additional brief solvent wash. In yet other embodiments, compounds of the invention may be covalently linked to a stent or graft. A covalent linker may be used which degrades in vivo, leading to the release of the compound of the invention. Any bio-labile linkage may be used for such a purpose, such as ester, amide or anhydride linkages. Compounds of the invention may additionally be administered intravascularly from a balloon used during angioplasty. Extravascular administration of the compounds via the pericard or via advential application of formulations of the invention may also be performed to decrease restenosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of stent devices which may be used as described are disclosed, for example, in the following references, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference: U.S. Pat.

Those molecules with two or more chiral centers, unless otherwise noted, exist as a racemic mixture of diastereomers. Single enantiomers/diastereomers may be obtained by methods known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \nExamples \n\n\nExample 1 \n\n\nExpression and Inhibition Assays of p110α/p85α, p110β/p85α, p110δ/p85α, and p110γ\n\n\n \n \n \nClass I PI3-Ks can be either purchased (p110α/p85α, p110β/p85α, p110δ/p85α from Upstate, and p110γ from Sigma) or expressed as previously described (Knight et al., 2004). IC50 values are measured using either a standard TLC assay for lipid kinase activity (described below) or a high-throughput membrane capture assay. Kinase reactions are performed by preparing a reaction mixture containing kinase, inhibitor (2% DMSO final concentration), buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2), and freshly sonicated phosphatidylinositol (100 μg/ml). Reactions are initiated by the addition of ATP containing 10 μCi of γ-32P-ATP to a \n \nfinal concentration\n \n 10 or 100\n1\n1M and allowed to proceed for 5 minutes at room temperature. For TLC analysis, reactions are then terminated by the addition of 105 μl 1N HCl followed by 160 μl CHCl3:MeOH (1:1). The biphasic mixture is vortexed, briefly centrifuged, and the organic phase is transferred to a new tube using a gel loading pipette tip precoated with CHCl\n3\n. This extract is spotted on TLC plates and developed for 3-4 hours in a 65:35 solution of n-propanol:1M acetic acid. The TLC plates are then dried, exposed to a phosphorimager screen (Storm, Amersham), and quantitated. For each compound, kinase activity is measured at 10-12 inhibitor concentrations representing two-fold dilutions from the highest concentration tested (typically, 200 μM). For compounds showing significant activity, IC50 determinations are repeated two to four times, and the reported value is the average of these independent measurements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther commercial kits or systems for assaying PI3-K activities are avaiable. The commercially available kits or systems can be used to screen for inhibitors and/or agonists of PI3-Ks including but not limited to PI 3-Kinase α, β, δ, and γ. An exemplary system is PI 3-Kinase (human) HTRF™ Assay from Upstate. The assay can be carried out according to the procedures suggested by the manufacturer. Briefly, the assay is a time resolved FRET assay that indirectly measures PIP3 product formed by the activity of a PI3-K.

The assay is performed in a 96 well microtiter plate using Alamar Blue reduction. Balb/c splenic B cells are purified over a Ficoll-Paque™ PLUS gradient followed by magnetic cell separation using a MACS B cell Isolation Kit (Miletenyi).

For example, stability of one or more compounds of the invention is established by an in vitro assay. In particular, an in vitro microsome stability assay is established that measures stability of one or more compounds of the invention when reacting with mouse, rat or human microsomes from liver. The microsome reaction with compounds is performed in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Each tube contains 0.1 μL of 10.0 mg/ml NADPH; 75 μL of 20.0 mg/ml mouse, rat or human liver microsome; 0.4 μL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer, and 425 μL of ddH\n2\nO. Negative control (without NADPH) tube contains 75 μL of 20.0 mg/ml mouse, rat or human liver microsome; 0.4 μL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer, and 525 μL of ddH\n2\nO. The reaction is started by adding 1.0 μL of 10.0 mM tested compound. The reaction tubes are incubated at 37° C. 100 μL sample is collected into new Eppendorf tube containing 300 μL cold Methanol at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes of reaction. Samples are centrifuged at 15,000 rpm to remove protein. Supernatant of centrifuged sample is transferred to new tube. Concentration of stable compound after reaction with microsome in the supernatant is measured by Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). The microsome stability of one or more compounds of the present invention when assayed under this condition have T1/2 (min) well within a range required for clinical development.\n\n\n \nExample 20 \n\n\nPlasma Stability Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe stability of one or more compounds of the invention in plasma is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. See, e.g., \nRapid Commun. Mass Spectrom., \n10: 1019-1026. The following procedure is an HPLC-MS/MS assay using human plasma; other species including monkey, dog, rat, and mouse are also available. Frozen, heparinized human plasma is thawed in a cold water bath and spun for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm at 4° C. prior to use. A compound of the invention is added from a 400 μM stock solution to an aliquot of pre-warmed plasma to give a final assay volume of 400 μL (or 800 μL for half-life determination), containing 5 μM test compound and 0.5% DMSO. Reactions are incubated, with shaking, for 0 minutes and 60 minutes at 37° C., or for 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes at 37 C for half life determination. Reactions are stopped by transferring 50 μL of the incubation mixture to 200 μL of ice-cold acetonitrile and mixed by shaking for 5 minutes. The samples are centrifuged at 6000×g for 15 minutes at 4° C. and 120 μL of supernatant removed into clean tubes. The samples are then evaporated to dryness and submitted for analysis by HPLC-MS/MS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere desired, one or more control or reference compounds (5 μM) are tested simultaneously with the test compounds: one compound, propoxycaine, with low plasma stability and another compound, propantheline, with intermediate plasma stability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples are reconstituted in acetonitrile/methanol/water (1/1/2, v/v/v) and analyzed via (RP)HPLC-MS/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The HPLC conditions consist of a binary LC pump with autosampler, a mixed-mode, Cl2, 2×20 mm column, and a gradient program. Peak areas corresponding to the analytes are recorded by HPLC-MS/MS. The ratio of the parent compound remaining after 60 minutes relative to the amount remaining at time zero, expressed as percent, is reported as plasma stability. In case of half-life determination, the half-life is estimated from the slope of the initial linear range of the logarithmic curve of compound remaining (%) vs. time, assuming first order kinetics.\n\n\n \nExample 21 \n\n\nChemical Stability\n\n\n \n \n \nThe chemical stability of one or more compounds of the invention is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. The following details an exemplary procedure for ascertaining chemical stability of a subject compound. The default buffer used for the chemical stability assay is phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4; other suitable buffers can be used. A compound of the invention is added from a 100 μM stock solution to an aliquot of PBS (in duplicate) to give a final assay volume of 400 μL, containing 5 μM test compound and 1% DMSO (for half-life determination a total sample volume of 700 μL is prepared). Reactions are incubated, with shaking, for 0 minutes and 24 hours at 37° C.; for half-life determination samples are incubated for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours. Reactions are stopped by adding immediately 100 μL of the incubation mixture to 100 μL of acetonitrile and vortexing for 5 minutes. The samples are then stored at −20° C. until analysis by HPLC-MS/MS. Where desired, a control compound or a reference compound such as chlorambucil (5 μM) is tested simultaneously with a compound of the invention of interest, as this compound is largely hydrolyzed over the course of 24 hours. Samples are analyzed via (RP)HPLC-MS/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The HPLC conditions consist of a binary LC pump with autosampler, a mixed-mode, Cl2, 2×20 mm column, and a gradient program. Peak areas corresponding to the analytes are recorded by HPLC-MS/MS. The ratio of the parent compound remaining after 24 hours relative to the amount remaining at time zero, expressed as percent, is reported as chemical stability. In case of half-life determination, the half-life is estimated from the slope of the initial linear range of the logarithmic curve of compound remaining (%) vs. time, assuming first order kinetics.\n\n\n \nExample 22 \n\n\nAkt Kinase Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nCells comprising components of the Akt/mTOR pathway, including but not limited to L6 myoblasts, B-ALL cells, B-cells, T-cells, leukemia cells, bone marrow cells, p190 transduced cells, philladelphia chromosome positive cells (Ph+), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, are typically grown in cell growth media such as DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum and/or antibiotics, and grown to confluency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to compare the effect of one or more compounds disclosed herein on Akt activation, the selected cells are serum starved overnight and incubated with one or more compounds disclosed herein or about 0.1% DMSO for approximately 1 minute to about 1 hour prior to stimulation with insulin (e.g. 100 nM) for about 1 minutes to about 1 hour. Cells are lysed by scraping into ice cold lysis buffer containing detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and protease inhibitors (e.g., PMSF). After contacting cells with lysis buffer, the solution is briefly sonicated, cleared by centrifugation, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF and immunoblotted using antibodies to phospho-Akt S473, phospho-Akt T308, Akt, and β-actin (Cell Signaling Technologies).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results demonstrate that one or more compounds of the invention inhibit insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at S473. Alternatively, some compounds of the invention additionally inhibit insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at T308. The class of compounds that can inhibit Akt signalling more effectively than rapamycin as shown herien include those (e.g., compounds shown in Table 1) that inhibit mTORC2 and \nmTORC\n 1.\n\n\n \nExample 23 \n\n\nKinase Signaling in Blood\n\n\n \n \n \nPI3K/Akt/mTor signaling is measured in blood cells using the phosflow method (Methods Enzymol. 2007;434:131-54). The advantage of this method is that it is by nature a single cell assay so that cellular heterogeneity can be detected rather than population averages. This allows concurrent dinstinction of signaling states in different populations defined by other markers. Phosflow is also highly quantitative. To test the effects of one or more compounds of the invention, unfractionated splenocytes, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated with anti-CD3 to initiate T-cell receptor signaling. The cells are then fixed and stained for surface markers and intracellular phosphoproteins. It is expected that inhibitors disclosed herein inhibit anti-CD3 mediated phosphorylation of Akt-S473 and S6, whereas rapamycin inhibits S6 phosphorylation and enhances Akt phosphorylation under the conditions tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, aliquots of whole blood are incubated for 15 minutes with vehicle (e.g. 0.1% DMSO) or kinase inhibitors at various concentrations, before addition of stimuli to crosslink the T cell receptor (TCR) (anti-CD3 with secondary antibody) or the B cell receptor (BCR) using anti-kappa light chain antibody (Fab′2 fragments). After approximately 5 and 15 minutes, samples are fixed (e.g. with cold 4% paraformaldehyde) and used for phosflow. Surface staining is used to distinguish T and B cells using antibodies directed to cell surface markers that are known to the art. The level of phosphrylation of kinase substrates such as Akt and S6 are then measured by incubating the fixed cells with labeled antibodies specific to the phosphorylated isoforms of these proteins. The population of cells is then analyzed by flow cytometery. The results are expected to show that one or more of the compounds of the invention can selectively inhibit signaling of one or more members of PI3K, mTOR, and Akt in blood cells under the conditions tested.\n\n\n \nExample 24 \n\n\nColony Formation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nMurine bone marrow cells freshly transformed with a p190 BCR-Abl retrovirus (herein referred to as p190 transduced cells) are plated in the presence of various drug combinations in M3630 methylcellulose media for about 7 days with recombinant human IL-7 in about 30% serum, and the number of colonies formed is counted by visual examination under a microscope. It is expected that compounds of the invention potentiate the effects of a half maximal concentration of known chemotherapeutic agents such as and without limitation imatinib, rapamycin, and dasatinib at the concentrations examined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are obtained from Philladelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) and negative (Ph−) subjects upon initial diagnosis or relapse. Live cells are isolated and enriched for CD19+ CD34+ B cell progenitors. After overnight liquid culture, cells are plated in methocult GF+H4435, Stem Cell Tehcnologies) suplemented with cytokines (IL-3, IL-6, IL-7, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CF, Flt3 ligand, and erythropoietin) and various concentrations of known chemotherapeutic agents in combination with either compounds of the invention. Colonies are counted by microscopy 12-14 days later. This method can be used to test for the additive or synergistic activity of various combination therapies utilizing the subject composition. It is expected that one or more the compounds of the present invention are potent and selective inhibitors of p190 transduced cell colony formation under the conditions tested.\n\n\n \nExample 25 \n\n\nIn Vivo Effect of Kinase Inhibitors on Leukemic Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nFemale recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a γ source in two doses about 4 hr apart, with approximately 5 Gy each. About lhr after the second radiation dose, mice are injected i.v. with about 1×10\n6 \nleukemic cells (e.g. Ph+ human or murine cells, or p190 transduced bone marrow cells). These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of about 5×10\n6 \nnormal bone marrow cells from 3-5 week old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs are harvested for analysis. Kinase inhibitor treatment begins about 10 days after leukemic cell injection and continues daily until the mice become sick or a maximum of approximately 35 days post-transplant Inhibitors are given by oral lavage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeripheral blood cells are collected approximately on day 10 (pre-treatment) and upon euthanization (post treatment), contacted with labled anti-hCD4 antibodies and counted by flow cytometry. This method can be used to demonstrate that the synergistic effect of one or more compounds of the invention alone or in combination with known chemotherapeutic agents significantly reduce leukemic blood cell counts as compared to treatment with known chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. Gleevec) alone under the conditions tested.\n\n\n \nExample 26 \n\n\nInhibition of Proliferation of Tumor Cells Deficient in PTEN Activity but Expressing PI3-kinases\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of one or more compounds of the invention to inhibit proliferation of tumor cells deficient in PTEN Activity but expressing PI3-kinases is tested according to the procedure detailed in example 17. As is shown in \nFIG. 7A\n, a compound of the present invention (e.g., a compound of Table 1) yields 50% inhibition of PC-3 cell proliferation at a concentration that is at least about two orders of magnitude less as compared to rapamycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWestern blot analysis revealed that the compound of the invention is capable of inhibiting phosphorylation of AKT (S473) and AKT (T308) as well as other downstream targets of the mTor signaling pathway to a greater degree than rapamycin. See \nFIG. 7B\n. In particular, PC-3 cells were plated at about 1×10\n5 \ncells/well in 24 well plates in a culture media containing 10% FBS. The cells were allowed to grow to about 80% confluent. Cells were treated for 2 hours at 37° C. in CO\n2 \nincubator with fresh cell culture media (10% FBS) with a compound of the present invention or rapamycin at indicated concentrations. After incubation, cells were lysed by adding 1× Cell Lysis Buffer (200 μl per well of 24-well plate of confluent cells). Proteins were separated via SDS-PAGE on 4-20% gradient gels and standard semi-dry blotting techniques are used to transfer the protein to nitrocellulose membranes. p-AKT(473), p-S6K, and p-4EBP1 were detected by using rabbit anti-human primary antibodies (Cell Signaling, Danvers, Mass.) followed by an HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, Mass.). The LumiGLO substrate (KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.) is used to detect the phospho-proteins on the Western blot.\n\n\n \nExample 27 \n\n\nTreatment of Lupus Disease Model Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nMice lacking the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb that opposes PI3K signaling in B cells develop lupus with high penetrance. FcγRIIb knockout mice (R2KO, Jackson Labs) are considered a valid model of the human disease as some lupus subjects show decreased expression or function of FcγRIIb (S. Bolland and J. V. Ravtech 2000. \nImmunity \n12:277-285).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe R2KO mice develop lupus-like disease with anti-nuclear antibodies, glomerulonephritis and proteinurea within about 4-6 months of age. For these experiments, the rapamycin analogue RAD001 (available from LC Laboratories) is used as a benchmark compound, and administered orally. This compound has been shown to ameliorate lupus symptoms in the B6.Sle1z.Sle3z model (T. Wu et al. \nJ. Clin Invest. \n117:2186-2196).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLupus disease model mice such as R2KO, BXSB or MLR/lpr are treated at about 2 months old, approximately for about two months. Mice are given doses of: vehicle, RAD001 at about 10 mg/kg, or compounds disclosed herein at approximately 10 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg. Blood and urine samples are obtained at approximately throughout the testing period, and tested for antinuclear antibodies (in dilutions of serum) or protein concentration (in urine). Serum is also tested for anti- ssDNA and anti-dsDNA antibodies by ELISA. Animals are euthanized at \nday\n 60 and tissues harvested for measuring spleen weight and kidney disease. Glomerulonephritis is assessed in kidney sections stained with H&E. Other animals are studied for about two months after cessation of treatment, using the same endpoints.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis model established in the art can be employed to test that the kinase inhibitors disclosed herein can suppress or delay the onset of lupus symptoms in lupus disease model mice.\n\n\n \nExample 28 \n\n\nMurine Bone Marrow Transplant Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nFemale recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a γ ray source. About lhr after the radiation dose, mice are injected with about 1×106 leukemic cells from early passage p190 transduced cultures (e.g. as described in \nCancer Genet Cytogenet. \n2005 August; 161(1):51-6) . These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of approximately 5×106 normal bone marrow cells from 3-5 wk old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs harvested for flow cytometry and/or magnetic enrichment. Treatment begins on approximately \nday\n 10 and continues daily until mice become sick, or after a maximum of about 35 days post-transplant. Drugs are given by oral gavage (p.o.). In a pilot experiment a dose of chemotherapeutic that is not curative but delays leukemia onset by about one week or less is identified; controls are vehicle-treated or treated with chemotherapeutic agent, previously shown to delay but not cure leukemogenesis in this model (e.g. imatinib at about 70 mg/kg twice daily). For the first phase p190 cells that express eGFP are used, and postmortem analysis is limited to enumeration of the percentage of leukemic cells in bone marrow, spleen and lymph node (LN) by flow cytometry. In the second phase, p190 cells that express a tailless form of human CD4 are used and the postmortem analysis includes magnetic sorting of hCD4+ cells from spleen followed by immunoblot analysis of key signaling endpoints: p Akt-T308 and S473; pS6 and p4EBP-1. As controls for immunoblot detection, sorted cells are incubated in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitors of the present disclosure inhibitors before lysis. Optionally, “phosflow” is used to detect p Akt-S473 and pS6-S235/236 in hCD4-gated cells without prior sorting. These signaling studies are particularly useful if, for example, drug-treated mice have not developed clinical leukemia at the 35 day time point. Kaplan-Meier plots of survival are generated and statistical analysis done according to methods known in the art. Results from p190 cells are analyzed separated as well as cumulatively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples of peripheral blood (100-200 μl) are obtained weekly from all mice, starting on \nday\n 10 immediately prior to commencing treatment.

Harvested plasma is frozen for pharmacokinetic detection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are expected to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic parameters such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity for the compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \nExample 30 \n\n\nCombination use of PI3Kδ Inhibitors and Agents that Inhibit IgE Production or Activity\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may present synergistic or additive efficacy when administered in combination with an inhibitors selective for one or more PI3-kinase, e.g., PI3Kδ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPI3Kδ inhibitors may be efficacious in treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders (AIID) for example rheumatoid arthritis. When a PI3Kδ inhibitor cause an undesired level of IgE production, one may choose to administer it in combination with an agent that inhibits IgE production or IgE activity such as an \nmTORC\n 1 and/or mTORC2 inhibitor disclosed herein. Additionally, the administration of PI3Kδ or PI3Kδ/γ inhibitors in combination with inhibitors of mTOR may also exhibit synergy through enhanced inhibition of the PI3K pathway. Various in vivo and in vitro models may be used to establish the effect of such combination treatment on AIID including but not limited to (a) in vitro B-cell antibody production assay, (b) in vivo TNP assay, and (c) rodent collagen induced arthritis model.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) B-Cell Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice are euthanized, and the spleens are removed and dispersed through a nylon mesh to generate a single-cell suspension. The splenocytes are washed (following removal of erythrocytes by osmotic shock) and incubated with anti-CD43 and anti-Mac-1 antibody-conjugated microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). The bead-bound cells are separated from unbound cells using a magnetic cell sorter. The magnetized column retains the unwanted cells and the resting B cells are collected in the flow-through. Purified B-cells are stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or an anti-CD40 antibody and \ninterleukin\n 4 Stimulated B-cells are treated with vehicle alone or with a PI3Kδ inhibitor with and without mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin, rapalogs, or mTORC1/C2 inhibitors disclosed herein. The results are expected to show that in the presence of mTOR inhibitors alone (e.g., rapamycin as well as the subject inhibitiors capable of inhibiting both \nmTORC\n 1 and mTORC2), there is little to no substantial effect on IgG and IgE response. However, in the presence of PI3Kδ and mTOR inhibitors, the B-cells are expected to exhibit a decreased IgG response as compared to the B-cells treated with vehicle alone, and the B-cells are expected to exhibit a decreased IgE response as compared to the response from B-cells treated with PI3Kδ inhibitors alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) TNP Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice are immunized with TNP-Ficoll or TNP-KHL and treated with: vehicle, a PI3Kδ inhibitor, an mTOR inhibitor, for example rapamycin, or a PI3Kδ inhibitor in combination with an mTOR inhibitor such as rapamycin. Antigen-specific serum IgE is measured by ELISA using TNP-BSA coated plates and isotype specific labeled antibodies. This assay can be used to test that mice treated with an mTOR inhibitor alone exhibit little or no substantial effect on antigen specific IgG3 response and no statistically significant elevation in IgE response as compared to the vehicle control. This assay can also be used to test that mice treated with both PI3Kδ inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor exhibit a reduction in antigen specific IgG3 response as compared to the mice treated with vehicle alone. Additionally, this assay can be employed to test that the mice treated with both PI3Kδ inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor exhibit a decrease in IgE response as compared to the mice treated with PI3Kδ inhibitor alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) Rat Collagen Induced Arthritis Model\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFemale Lewis rats are anesthetized and given collagen injections prepared and administered as described previously on \nday\n 0. On \nday\n 6, animals are anesthetized and given a second collagen injection. Caliper measurements of normal (pre-disease) right and left ankle joints are performed on \nday\n 9. On days 10-11, arthritis typically occurs and rats are randomized into treatment groups. Randomization is performed after ankle joint swelling is obviously established and there is good evidence of bilateral disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter an animal is selected for enrollment in the study, treatment is initiated. Animals are given vehicle, PI3Kδ inhibitor, or PI3Kδ inhibitor in combination with an mTOR inhibitor. Dosing is administered on days 1-6. Rats are weighed on days 1-7 following establishment of arthritis and caliper measurements of ankles taken every day. Final body weights are taken on \nday\n 7 and animals are euthanized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis assay can be uesed to test that the combination treatment using PI3Kδ inhibitor and an inhibitor of mTOR provides greater efficacy than treatment with PI3Kδ inhibitor alone.\n\n\n \nExample 31 \n\n\nInhibition of Tumor Growth In Vivo\n\n\n \n \n \nCell lines: Tumor cell lines such as A549, U87, ZR-75-1 and 786-0 are obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va.). Cells are proliferated and preserved cryogenically at early passage (e.g. passage 3). One aliquot is used for further proliferation to get enough cells for one TGI study (at about passage 9).\n\n\n \nAnimals\n\n\n \n \n \nFemale athymic nude mice are supplied by Harlan. Mice are received at 4 to 6 weeks of age. All mice are acclimated for about one day to two weeks prior to handling. The mice are housed in microisolator cages and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. The mice are fed with irradiated mouse chow and freely available autoclaved water is provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor Xenograft Model: Mice are inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with 0.01 to 0.5 ml of tumor cells such as those listed above (approximately 1.0×10\n5 \nto 1.0×10\n8 \ncells/mouse). Five to 10 days following inoculation, tumors are measured using calipers and tumor weight is calculated, for example using the animal study management software, such as Study Director V.1.6.70 (Study Log). Mice with tumor sizes of about 120 mg are pair-matched into desired groups using Study Director (Day 1). Body weights are recorded when the mice are pair-matched. Tumor volume and bodyweight measurements are taken one to four times weekly and gross observations are made at least once daily. On \nDay\n 1, compounds of the present invention and reference compounds as well as vehicle control are administered by oral gavage or iv as indicated. At the last day of the experiment, mice are sacrificed and their tumors are collected 1-4 hours after the final dose. The tumors are excised and cut into two sections. One third of the tumor is fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin blocks and the remaining two thirds of tumor is snap frozen and stored at −80° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nData and Statistical Analysis: Mean Tumor Growth Inhibition (TGI) is Calculated Utilizing the Following Formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumors that regress from the \nDay\n 1 starting size are removed from the calculations. Individual tumor shrinkage (TS) is calculated using the formula below for tumors that show regression relative to \nDay\n 1 tumor weight. The mean tumor shrinkage of each group is calculated and reported.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe model can be employed to show whether the compounds of the invention can inhibit tumor cell growth including but not limited to renal carcinomoa cell growth, breast cancer cell growth, lung cancer cell growth, or glioblastoma cell growth under the conditions tested.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTS\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nTumor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\nFinal\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nTumor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeight\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nDay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]\n\n\n\n\n×\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIGS. 3A-3B\n, a compound of the invention of Formula I′-A′ reduces tumor size in the U87 human glioblastoma xenograft mdoel in a dose dependent manner over a period of 14-day treatment. \nFIG. 3C\n shows that the compound has no substantial toxic effect on the animal as there was no significant weight loss during the treatment. Excised tumors (\nFIG. 3C\n) were further examined by Western blot analysis which revealed inhibition of mTOR/Akt signalling by the compound of the invention (\nFIGS. 4B and 10\n). In particular, inhibition of mTOR/Akt signalling was evidenced by a decrease in phosphorylated Akt at residues S473 and T308, pS6, p4EBP-1,and Cyclin D1. The compound of the invention is more potent in inhibiting mTOR/Akt signalling as compared to an inhibitor that is not selective for mTORs, such as one commonly referred to as PanPI3K/mTor inhibitor. The excised tumors were also subject to TUNEL staining (\nFIG. 12\n) which shows tumor cell death after the treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe same experiment was performed with several other tumor models including tumor cell A549 induced NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer), tumor cell ZR-75-1 induced breast cancer, and tumor cell 786-O induced RCC (renal cell carcinoma). \nFIGS. 11B-11D\n indicate that the efficacy of the compound of the invention in treating all of these tumors became detectable as early as one week after treatment. The effect of reduction in tumor size in all instances last at least 1 month."

Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nSubstance P is a naturally occurring undecapeptide belonging to the tachykinin family of peptides, the latter being so-named because of their prompt contractile action on extravascular smooth muscle tissue. The tachykinins are distinguished by a conserved carboxyl-terminal sequence. In addition to substance P, the known mammalian tachykinins include neurokinin A and neurokinin B. The current nomenclature designates the receptors for substance P, neurokinin A, and neurokinin B as neurokinin-1 (NK-1), neurokinin-2 (NK-2), and neurokinin-3 (NK-3), respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTachykinin, and in particular substance P, antagonists are useful in the treatment of clinical conditions which are characterized by the presence of an excess of tachykinin, in particular substance P, activity, including disorders of the central nervous system, nociception and pain, gastrointestinal disorders, disorders of bladder function and respiratory diseases.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is directed to certain hydroxymethyl ether hydroisoindoline compounds of Formula (I) which are useful as neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists, and inhibitors of tachykinin and in particular substance P. The invention is also concerned with pharmaceutical formulations comprising these compounds as active ingredients and the use of the compounds and their formulations in the treatment of certain

diastereomers thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds. Formula I shows the structure of the class of compounds without preferred stereochemistry. The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration. If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are several acceptable methods of naming the compounds discussed herein.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the above compound can be named either as “(3aR,4R,5S,7aR)tert-butyl-5-hydroxy-4-(2-methylphenyl)octahydro-2H-isoindole-2-carboxylate” or “tert-butyl (3aR,4R,5S,7aR)-5-hydroxy-4-phenyloctahydro-2H-isoindole-2-carboxylate”.

This activity can be demonstrated by the following assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReceptor Expression in COS: To express the cloned human neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) transiently in COS, the cDNA for the human NK1R was cloned into the expression vector pCDM9 which was derived from pCDM8 (INVITROGEN) by inserting the ampicillin resistance gene (nucleotide 1973 to 2964 from BLUESCRIPT SK+) into the Sac II site. Transfection of 20 ug of the plasmid DNA into 10 million COS cells was achieved by electroporation in 800 ul of transfection buffer (135 mM NaCl, 1.2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1.2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 2.4 mM K\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 0.6 mM KH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 10 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4) at 260 V and 950 uF using the IBI GENEZAPPER (IBI, New Haven, Conn.). The cells were incubated in 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 90% DMEM media (GIBCO, Grand Island, N.Y.) in 5% CO\n2 \nat 37° C. for three days before the binding assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStable Expression in CHO: To establish a stable cell line expressing the cloned human NK1R, the cDNA was subcloned into the vector pRcCMV (INVITROGEN). Transfection of 20 ug of the plasmid DNA into CHO cells was achieved by electroporation in 800 ul of transfection buffer supplemented with 0.625 mg/ml Herring sperm DNA at 300 V and 950 uF using the IBI GENEZAPPER (IBI). The transfected cells were incubated in CHO media [10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine, 1/500 hypoxanthine-thymidine (ATCC), 90% IMDM media (JRH BIOSCIENCES, Lenexa, Kans.), 0.7 mg/ml G418 (GIBCO)] in 5% CO\n2 \nat 37° C. until colonies were visible. Each colony was separated and propagated. The cell clone with the highest number of human NK1R was selected for subsequent applications such as drug screening.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssay Protocol using COS or CHO: The binding assay of human NK1R expressed in either COS or CHO cells is based on the use of \n125\nI-substance P (\n125\nI-SP, from DU PONT, Boston, Mass.) as a radioactively labeled ligand which competes with unlabeled substance P or any other ligand for binding to the human NK1R. Monolayer cell cultures of COS or CHO were dissociated by the non-enzymatic solution (SPECIALTY MEDIA, Lavallette, N.J.) and resuspended in appropriate volume of the binding buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl\n2\n, 150 mM NaCl, 0.04 mg/ml bacitracin, 0.004 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 0.01 mM phosphoramidon) such that 200 ul of the cell suspension would give rise to about 10,000 cpm of specific \n125\nI-SP binding (approximately 50,000 to 200,000 cells). In the binding assay, 200 ul of cells were added to a tube containing 20 ul of 1.5 to 2.5 nM of \n125\nI-SP and 20 ul of unlabeled substance P or any other test compound. The tubes were incubated at 4° C. or at room temperature for 1 hour with gentle shaking. The bound radioactivity was separated from unbound radioactivity by GF/C filter (BRANDEL, Gaithersburg, Md.) which was pre-wetted with 0.1% polyethylenimine. The filter was washed with 3 ml of wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MnCl\n2\n, 150 mM NaCl) three times and its radioactivity was determined by gamma counter. The activation of phospholipase C by NK1R may also be measured in CHO cells expressing the human NK1R by determining the accumulation of inositol monophosphate which is a degradation product of IP\n3\n. CHO cells are seeded in 12-well plate at 250,000 cells per well. After incubating in CHO media for 4 days, cells are loaded with 0.025 uCi/ml of \n3\nH-myoinositol by overnight incubation. The extracellular radioactivity is removed by washing with phosphate buffered saline. LiCl is added to the well at final concentration of 0.1 mM with or without the test compound, and incubation is continued at 37° C. for 15 mM. Substance P is added to the well at final concentration of 0.3 nM to activate the human NK1R. After 30 min of incubation at 37° C., the media is removed and 0.1 N HCl is added. Each well is sonicated at 4° C. and extracted with CHCl\n3\n/methanol (1:1). The aqueous phase is applied to a 1 ml Dowex AG 1X8 ion exchange column. The column is washed with 0.1 N formic acid followed by 0.025 M ammonium formate-0.1 N formic acid.

This term in relation to pharmaceutical compositions is intended to encompass a product comprising one or more active ingredients, and an optional carrier comprising inert ingredients, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. In general, pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active object compound is included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect upon the process or condition of diseases. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. By “pharmaceutically acceptable” it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. Compositions for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a suitable oil. Oil-in-water emulsions may also be employed. Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of the present compounds may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension.
