Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of Invention:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to certain carbazole derivatives, their stereoisomers, their salts, their preparation and medicines containing them.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nVarious central nervous system disorders such as anxiety, depression, motor disorders etc., are believed to involve a disturbance of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin. Serotonin is localized in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is known to affect many types of conditions including psychiatric disorders, motor activity, feeding behavior, sexual activity, and neuroendocrine regulation among others. 5-HT receptor subtypes regulate the various effects of serotonin. Known 5-HT receptor family includes the 5-HT\n1\n family (\ne\n.\ng\n. 5-HT\n1A\n), the 5-HT\n2\n family (e.g.5- HT\n2A\n), 5-HT\n3\n, 5-HT\n4\n, 5-HT\n5\n, 5-HT\n6\n and 5-HT\n7\n subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 5-HT\n6\n receptor subtype was first cloned from rat tissue in 1993 (\nMonsma, F. J.; Shen, Y.; Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327\n) and subsequently from human tissue (\nKohen, R.; Metcalf, M. A.; Khan, N.; Druck, T.; Huebner, K.; Sibley, D. R., Journal of Neurochemistry, 1996, 66, 47-56\n). The receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) positively coupled to adenylate cyclase (\nRuat, M.; Traiffort, E.; Arrang, J-M.; Tardivel-Lacombe, L.; Diaz, L.; Leurs, R.; Schwartz, J-C., Biochemical Biophysical Research Communications, 1993, 193, 268-276\n). The receptor is found almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS) areas both in rat and in human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nIn situ\n hybridization studies of the 5-HT\n6\n receptor in rat brain using mRNA indicate principal localization in the areas of 5-HT projection including striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and hippocampal formation (\nWard, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W.; Lachowicz, J. E.; Hoffinan, B. J.; Sibley, D. R.; Dorsa, D. M., Neuroscience, 1995, 64, 1105-1111\n). Highest levels of 5-HT\n6\n receptor mRNA has been observed in the olfactory tubercle, the striatum, nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus as well as CA\n1\n, CA\n2\n and CA\n3\n regions of the hippocampus. Lower levels of 5-HT\n6\n receptor mRNA were seen in the granular layer of the cerebellum, several diencephalic nuclei, amygdala and in the cortex. Northern blots have revealed that 5-HT\n6\n receptor mRNA appears to be exclusively present in the brain, with little evidence for its presence in peripheral tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe high affinity of a number of antipsychotic agents for the 5-HT\n6\n receptor, in addition to its mRNA localization in striatum, olfactory tubercle and nucleus accumbens suggests that some of the clinical actions of these compounds may be mediated through this receptor. Its ability to bind a wide range of therapeutic compounds used in psychiatry, coupled with its intriguing distribution in the brain has stimulated significant interest in new compounds which are capable of interacting with or affecting the said receptor. At present, there are no known fully selective agonists. Significant efforts are being made to understand the possible role of the 5-HT\n6\n receptor in psychiatry, cognitive dysfunction, motor function and control, memory, mood and the like. To that end, compounds which demonstrate a binding affinity for the 5-HT\n6\n receptor are earnestly sought both as an aid in the study of the 5-HT\n6\n receptor and as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of central nervous system disorders, for example see \nC. Reavill and D. C. Rogers, Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2001, 2(1):104-109, Pharma Press Ltd\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are many potential therapeutic uses for 5-HT\n6\n ligands in humans based on direct effects and on indications from available scientific studies. These studies include the localization of the receptor, the affinity of ligands with known in vivo activity, and various animal studies conducted so far. Preferably, antagonist compounds of 5-HT\n6\n receptors are sought after as therapeutic agents. One potential therapeutic use of modulators of 5-HT\n6\n receptor function is in the enhancement of cognition and memory in human diseases such as Alzheimer's. The high levels of receptor found in important structures in the forebrain, including the caudate/putamen, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and cortex suggest a role for the receptor in memory and cognition since these areas are known to play a vital role in memory (\nGerard, C.; Martres, M. -P.; Lefevre, K.; Miquel, M. C.; Verge, D.; Lanfumey, R.; Doucet, E.; Hamon, M.; EI Mestikawy, S., Brain Research, 1997, 746, 207-219\n). The ability of known 5-HT\n6\n receptor ligands to enhance cholinergic transmission also supported the potential cognition use (\nBentey, J. C.; Boursson, A. ; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies have found that a known 5-HT\n6\n selective antagonist significantly increased glutamate and aspartate levels in the frontal cortex without elevating levels of noradrenaline, dopamine, or 5-HT. This selective elevation of neurochemicals known to be involved in memory and cognition strongly suggests a role for 5-HT\n6\n ligands in cognition (\nDawson, L. A.; Nguyen, H. Q.; Li, P. British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 130 (1), 23-26\n). Animal studies of memory and learning with a known selective 5-HT\n6\n antagonist found some positive effects (\nRogers, D. C.; Hatcher, P. D.; Hagan, J. J. Society ofNeuroscience, Abstracts, 2000, 26, 680\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA related potential therapeutic use for 5-HT\n6\n ligands is the treatment of attention deficit disorders (ADD, also known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD) in both children and adults. Because 5-HT\n6\n antagonists appear to enhance the activity of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and because ADHD has been linked to abnormalities in the caudate (\nErnst, M; Zametkin, A. J.; Matochik, J. H.; Jons, P. A.; Cohen, R. M., Journal of Neuroscience, 1998, 18(15), 5901-5907\n), 5-HT\n6\n antagonists may attenuate attention deficit disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternational Patent Publication \n \nWO 03/066056 A1\n \n reports that antagonism of 5-HT\n6\n receptor could promote neuronal growth within the central nervous system of a mammal. Another International Patent Publication \n \nWO 03/065046 A2\n \n discloses new variant of human 5-HT\n6\n receptor, and proposes that human 5-HT\n6\n receptor is being associated with numerous other disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEarly studies examining the affinity of various CNS ligands with known therapeutic utility or a strong structural resemblance to known drugs suggests a role for 5-HT\n6\n ligands in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. For example, clozapine (an effective clinical antipsychotic) has high affinity for the 5-HT\n6\n receptor subtype. Also, several clinical antidepressants have high affinity for the receptor as well and act as antagonists at this site (\nBranchek, T. A.; Blackburn, T. P., Annual Reviews in Pharmacology and Toxicology, 2000, 40, 319-334\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, recent in vivo studies in rats indicate that 5-HT\n6\n modulators may be useful in the treatment of movement disorders including epilepsy (\nStean, T.; Routledge, C.; Upton, N., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 127 Proc. Supplement-131P\n; and \nRoutledge, C.; Bromidge, S. M.; Moss, S. F.; Price, G. W.; Hirst, W.; Newman, H.; Riley, G.; Gager, T.; Stean, T.; Upton, N.; Clarke, S. E.; Brown, A. M., British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 30 (7), 1606-1612\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together, the above studies strongly suggest that compounds which are 5-HT\n6\n receptor modulators, i.e. ligands, may be useful for therapeutic indications including: the treatment of diseases associated with a deficit in memory, cognition, and learning such as Alzheimer's and attention deficit disorder; the treatment of personality disorders such as schizophrenia; the treatment of behavioral disorders, e. g. anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorders; the treatment of motion or motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy; the treatment of diseases associated with neurodegeneration such as stroke or head trauma; or withdrawal from drug addiction including addiction to nicotine, alcohol, and other substances of abuse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder. See for example, \nB. L. Roth et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1994, 268, pages 1403-14120\n, \nD. R. Sibley et al., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327\n, \nA. J.

Sleight et al., Serotonin ID Research Alert, 1997, 2(3), 115-118\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the effect of 5-HT\n6\n antagonist and 5-HT\n6\n antisense oligonucleotides to reduce food intake in rats has been reported thus potentially in treatment of obesity. See for example, \nBentley et al., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, Suppl., 126, A64: 255\n; \nWooley et al., Neuropharmacology, 2001, 41: 210-129\n; and \n \nWO 02/098878\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternational Patent Publications \n \nWO 2004/055026 A1\n \n, \n \nWO 2004/048331 A1\n \n, \n \nWO 2004/048330 A1\n \n and \n \nWO 2004/048328 A2\n \n (all assigned to Suven Life Sciences Limited) describes related prior art.

Its ability to bind a wide range of therapeutic compounds used in psychiatry, coupled with its intriguing distribution in the brain has stimulated significant interest in new compounds which are capable of interacting with or affecting said receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly, it has now been found that carbazole derivatives of formula (I) demonstrate 5-HT\n6\n receptor affinity,\n\n \n \n\nincluding its stereoisomer or its salt with an inorganic or organic acid, wherein: '----' dashed line represents optional double bond; Ar represents any one group selected from phenyl, naphthyl, monocyclic or bicyclic heteroaryl, each of which may be further substituted by one or more independent substituents as defined by R\n1\n; Ar- for example may be,\n\n \n \n\nR\n1\n represents one or multiple substitutions on the benzene ring, and includes a hydrogen, halogen, cyano, (C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl, halo(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkoxy, halo(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkoxy, cyclo(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)alkyl or cyclo(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy; R represents either hydrogen or (C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl; and \"n\" represents integer either 1 or 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach group of compound (I) is explained below. Each term used herein is defined to have meanings described below in either case of a single or a joint use with other terms, unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"halogen\" as used herein and in the claims (unless the context indicates otherwise) means atom such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl\" as used herein and in the claims (unless the context indicates otherwise) means \nstraight and branched chain alkyl radicals containing from one to three carbon atoms and includes\n methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and iso-propyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkoxy\" as used herein and in the claims (unless the context indicates otherwise) means \nstraight and branched chain alkoxy radicals containing from one to three carbon atoms and includes\n methoxy, ethoxy, propyloxy and iso-propyloxy, which may be further substituted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"halo(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkyl\" as used herein and in the claims (unless the context indicates otherwise) means \nstraight and branched chain\n alkyl radicals containing from one to three carbon atoms and includes fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, trifluoroethyl, fluoroethyl, difluoroethyl and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"halo(C\n1\n-C\n3\n)alkoxy\" as used herein and in the claims (unless the context indicates otherwise) means \nstraight and branched chain alkoxy radicals containing from one to three carbon atoms and includes\n fluoromethoxy, difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, trifluoroethoxy, fluoroethoxy, difluoroethoxy and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"cyclo(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)alkyl\" as used herein and in the claims (unless the context indicates otherwise) means \ncyclic alkyl radicals containing from three to six carbon atoms and includes\n cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, the cycloalkyl group may be substituted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"cyclo(C\n3\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy\" as used herein and in the claims (unless the context indicates otherwise) means \ncyclic alkoxy radicals containing from three to six carbon atoms and includes\n cyclopropyloxy, cyclobutyloxy, cyclopentyloxy, cyclohexyloxy, the cycloalkoxy group may be substituted and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"heteroaryl\" is intended to mean a 5 or 6 membered monocyclic aromatic or a fused 8- 10 membered bicyclic aromatic ring containing 1 to 3 heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur. Suitable examples of such monocyclic aromatic rings include thienyl, furyl, pyrrolyl, triazolyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, thiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, isothiazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiadiazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyrimidyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl and pyridyl.

Heteroaryl groups, as described above, may be linked to the remainder of the molecule via a carbon atom or, when present, a suitable nitrogen atom except where otherwise indicated above. It will be appreciated that wherein the above mentioned aryl or heteroaryl groups have more than one substituent, said substituents may be linked to form a ring, for example a carboxyl and amine group may be linked to form an amide group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term 5-to 7-membered heterocyclic ring is intended to mean a non aromatic ring containing 1 to 3 heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur.

Suitable examples of 5-to 7-membered heterocyclic rings include piperidinyl, tetrahydropyridinyl, pyrrolidinyl, morpholinyl, azepanyl, diazepanyl and piperazinyl. A 5-to7- membered heterocyclic ring, as described above, may be linked to the remainder of the molecule via a carbon atom or a suitable nitrogen atom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds of formula (I) are capable of existing in stereoisomeric forms (e. g. diastereomers and enantiomers) and the invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated one from the other by the usual methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. The invention also extends to any tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"stereoisomers\" is a general term for all isomers of the individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. It includes mirror image isomers (enantiomers), geometric (cis-trans) isomers and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral centre that are not mirror images of one another (diastereomers).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stereoisomers as a rule are generally obtained as racemates that can be separated into the optically active isomers in a manner known per se. In the case of the compounds of general formula (I) having an asymmetric carbon atom the present invention relates to the D-form, the L-form and D,L- mixtures and in the case of a number of asymmetric carbon atoms, the diastereomeric forms and the invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. Those compounds of general formula (I) which have an asymmetric carbon and as a rule are obtained as racemates can be separated one from the other by the usual methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. However, it is also possible to employ an optically active compound from the start, a correspondingly optically active or diastereomeric compound then being obtained as the final compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stereoisomers of compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by one or more ways presented below:\n\n \n \n \ni) One or more of the reagents may be used in their optically active form.\n \nii) Optically pure catalyst or chiral ligands along with metal catalyst may be employed in the reduction process. The metal catalysts may be employed in the reduction process. The metal catalyst may be Rhodium, Ruthenium, Indium and the like. The chiral ligands may preferably be chiral phosphines (\nPrinciples of Asymmetric synthesis, J. E. Baldwin Ed., Tetrahedron series, 14, 311-316\n).\n \niii) The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as forming a diastereomeric salts with chiral acids or chiral amines, or chiral amino alcohols, chiral amino acids. The resulting mixture of diastereomers may then be separated by methods such as fractional crystallization, chromatography and the like, which is followed by an additional step of isolating the optically active product by hydrolyzing the derivative (\nJacques et. al., \"\nEnantiomers, Racemates and Resolution\n\", Wiley Interscience, 1981\n).\n \niv) The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as microbial resolution, resolving the diastereomeric salts formed with chiral acids or chiral bases.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nChiral acids that can be employed may be tartaric acid, mandelic acid, lactic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, amino acids and the like. Chiral bases that can be employed may be cinchona alkaloids, brucine or a basic amino group such as lysine, arginine and the like. In the case of the compounds of general formula (I) containing geometric isomerism the present invention relates to all of these geometric isomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts will be apparent to those skilled in the art and include those described in \nJ. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19\n, such as acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids e. g. hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric or phosphoric acid; and organic acids e. g. succinic, maleic, acetic, fumaric, citric, tartaric, benzoic, p-toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic or naphthalenesulfonic acid. The present invention includes within its scope all possible stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric forms. Solvents such as water, acetone, ether, THF, methanol, ethanol, t-butanol, dioxane, isopropanol, isopropyl ether or mixtures thereof may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the addition to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, other salts are included in the invention. They may serve as intermediates in the purification of the compounds, in the preparation of other salts, or in the identification and characterization of the compounds or intermediates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) may be prepared in crystalline or non-crystalline form, and, if crystalline, may optionally be solvated, eg. as the hydrate. This invention includes within its scope stoichiometric solvates (eg. hydrates) as well as compounds containing variable amounts of solvent (eg. water).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which comprises of contacting a compound of formula (a) wherein all the substitutents such as n, R\n1\n, R and Ar are as defined for the compound of formula (I) earlier, with a sulfone derivative of formula (b):\n\n \n \n\nwherein, Ar are as defmed for the compound of formula (I) earlier; and Lg represents as halogen atom (eg. fluoro, chloro or iodo); in presence of suitable base and inert solvent at suitable temperature to obtain a compound of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above reaction is preferably carried out in a solvent such as THF, toluene, DCM, acetone, water, DMF, DMSO, DME, and the like or a mixture thereof, and preferably using either acetone or DMF. The inert atmosphere may be maintained by using inert gases such as N\n2\n, Ar or He. The reaction may be affected in the presence of a base such as K\n2\nCO\n3\n, Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, NaH or mixtures thereof. The reaction temperature may range from 0 °C to 100 °C based on the choice of solvent and preferably at a temperature in the range from 0 °C to 50 °C. The duration of the reaction may range from 1 to 24 hours, preferably from 2 to 6 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds obtained by the above method of preparation of the present invention can be transferred to another compound of this invention by further chemical modifications of well-known reaction such as oxidation, reduction, protection, deprotection, rearrangement reaction, halogenation, hydroxylation, alkylation, alkylthiolation, demethylation, O-alkylation, O-acylation, N-alkylation, N-alkenylation, N-acylation, N-cyanation, N-sulfonylation, coupling reaction using transition metals and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf necessary, any one or more than one of the following steps can be carried out,\n\n \n \n \ni) converting a compound of the formula (I) into another compound of the formula (I)\n \nii) removing any protecting groups; or\n \niii) forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or a prodrug thereof.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn process (i), pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be prepared conventionally by reaction with the appropriate acid or acid derivative as described earlier in detail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn process (ii), examples of protecting groups and the means for their removal can be found in \nT. W. Greene '\nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\n' (J. Wiley and Sons, 1991\n). Suitable amine protecting groups include sulphonyl (e. g. tosyl), acyl (e. g. acetyl, 2', 2', 2'-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl) and arylalkyl (e. g. benzyl), which may be removed by hydrolysis (e. g. using an acid such as hydrochloric or trifluoroacetic acid) or reductively (e. g. hydrogenolysis of a benzyl group or reductive removal of a 2', 2', 2'-trichloroethoxycarbonyl group using zinc in acetic acid) as appropriate. Other suitable amine protecting groups include trifluoroacetyl(-COCF\n3\n) which may be removed by base catalysed hydrolysis or a solid phase resin bound benzyl group, such as a Merrifield resin bound 2,6-dimethoxybenzyl group(Ellman linker), which may be removed by acid catalysed hydrolysis, for example with trifluoroacetic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProcess (iii) may be performed using conventional interconversion procedures such as epimerisation, oxidation, reduction, alkylation, nucleophilic or electrophilic aromatic substitution, ester hydrolysis or amide bond formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to use the compounds of formula (I) in therapy, they will normally be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Thus, the active compounds of the invention may be formulated for oral, buccal, intranasal, parental (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous) or rectal administration or a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters or ethyl alcohol); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor buccal administration, the composition may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, including using conventional catheterization techniques or infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulating agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe active compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor intranasal administration or administration by inhalation, the active compounds of the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from a pressurized container or a nebulizer, or from a capsule using a inhaler or insufflator. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas and the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The medicament for pressurized container or nebulizer may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound while for a capsule it preferably should be in the form of powder. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAerosol formulations for treatment of the conditions referred to above (e.g., migraine) in the average adult human are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or \"puff\" of aerosol contains 20 µg to 1000 µg of the compound of the invention. The overall daily dose with an aerosol will be within the range 100 µg to 10 mg. Administration may be several times daily, for example 2, 3, 4 or 8 times, giving for example, 1, 2 or 3 doses each time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn effective amount of a compound of general formula (I), or their derivatives as defined above can be used to produce a medicament, along with conventional pharmaceutical auxiliaries, carriers and additives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch therapy includes multiple choices: for example, administering two compatible compounds simultaneously in a single dose form or administering each compound individually in a separate dosage; or if required at same time interval or separately in order to maximize the beneficial effect or minimize the potential side-effects of the drugs according to the known principles of pharmacology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and/or toxicologically, with the other ingredients comprising a formulation, and/or the mammal being treated therewith.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present compounds are useful as pharmaceuticals for the treatment of various conditions in which the use of a 5-HT\n6\n receptor antagonist is indicated, such as in the treatment of central nervous system disturbances such as psychosis, schizophrenia, manic depression, depression, neurological disturbances, memory disturbances. Parkinsonism, amylotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Huntington's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"schizophrenia\" means schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder and psychotic disorder wherein the term \"psychotic\" refers to delusions, prominent hallucinations, disorganized speech or disorganized or catatonic behavior. See \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, fourth edition, American Psychiatric Association, Washington, D.C\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"treating\", \"treat\", or \"treatment\" embrace all the meanings such as preventative, prophylactic and palliative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"\nTherapeutically effective amount\n\" is defined as 'an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition, or disorder, (ii) attenuates, ameliorates, or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder, or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder described herein'.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose of the active compounds can vary depending on factors such as the route of administration, age and weight of patient, nature and severity of the disease to be treated and similar factors. Therefore, any reference herein to a pharmacologically effective amount of the compounds of general formula (I) refers to the aforementioned factors. A proposed dose of the active compounds of this invention, for either oral, parenteral, nasal or buccal administration, to an average adult human, for the treatment of the conditions referred to above, is 0.1 to 200 mg of the active ingredient per unit dose which could be administered, for example, 1 to 4 times per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor illustrative purposes, the reaction scheme depicted herein provides potential routes for synthesizing the compounds of the present invention as well as key intermediates. For a more detailed description of the individual reaction steps, see the Examples section. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be used to synthesize the inventive compounds. Although specific starting materials and reagents are depicted in the schemes and discussed below, other starting materials and reagents can be easily substituted to provide a variety of derivatives and/or reaction conditions.

Male wistar rats (230 - 280 g) obtained from N. I. N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as an experimental animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour animals were housed in each cage. Animals were kept on 20 % food deprivation before one day and given water ad libitum throughout the experiment and maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle. Also the rats were habituated to individual arenas for 1 hour in absence of any objects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne group of 12 rats received vehicle (1 mL/Kg) orally and another set of animals received compound of the formula (I) either orally or i.p., before one hour of the familiar (T1) and choice trial (T2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experiment was carried out in a 50 x 50 x 50 cm open field made up of acrylic. In the familiarization phase, (T1), the rats were placed individually in the open field for 3 min., in which two identical objects (plastic bottles, 12.5 cm height x 5.5 cm diameter) covered in yellow masking tape alone (a1 and a2) were positioned in two adjacent corners, 10 cm. from the walls. After 24 hour of the (T1) trial for long-term memory test, the same rats were placed in the same arena as they were placed in T1 trial. Choice phase (T2) rats were allowed to explore the open field for 3 min. in presence of one familiar object (a3) and one novel object (b) (Amber color glass bottle, 12 cm high and 5 cm in diameter. Familiar objects presented similar textures, colors and sizes. During the T1 and T2 trial, exploration of each object (defined as sniffing, licking, chewing or having moving vibrissae whilst directing the nose towards the object at a distance of less than 1 cm) were recorded separately by stopwatch. Sitting on an object was not regarded as exploratory activity, however, it was rarely observed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nT1 is the total time spent exploring the familiar objects (a1 + a2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nT2 is the total time spent exploring the familiar object and novel object (a3 +b).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe object recognition test was performed as described by \nEnnaceur, A., Delacour, J., 1988, A new one-trial test for neurobiological studies of memory in rats- Behavioral data, Behav. Brain Res., 31, 47-59\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative compounds have shown positive effects indicating the increased novel object recognition viz; increased exploration time with novel object and higher discrimination index.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 51: Chewing/Yawning/Stretching induction by 5HT\n6\nR antagonists.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMale Wistar rats weighing 200-250 g were used. Rats were given vehicle injections and placed in individual, transparent chambers for 1 h each day for 2 days before the test day, to habituate them to the observation chambers and testing procedure. On the test day, rats were placed in the observation chambers immediately after drug administration and observed continuously for yawning, stretching, and chewing behaviors from 60 to 90 min after drug or vehicle injections. 60 minutes prior to the drug administration Physostigmine, 0.1 mg/kg i.p. was administered to all the animals. Average number of yawns, stretches, and vacuous chewing movements during the 30 min observation period were recorded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe representative examples demonstrated 40 - 60 % increase in the stretching, yawning and chewing behaviors in comparison with the vehicle treated groups, at 1 mg/Kg, 3 mg/Kg, 10 mg/Kg and 30 mg/Kg.

The 10 cm\n2\n perspex platform, lying 1 cm below the water surface, was placed in the centre of one of the four imaginary quadrants, which remained constant for all rats. The black Perspex used in the construction of the maze and platform offered no intramaze cues to guide escape behavior. By contrast, the training room offered several strong extramaze visual cues to aid the formation of the spatial map necessary for escape learning. An automated tracking system, [Videomot 2 (5.51), TSE systems, Germany] was employed. This program analyzes video images acquired via a digital camera and an image acquisition board that determined path length, swim speed and the number of entries and duration of swim time spent in each quadrant of the water maze.

The training apparatus consisted of a chamber 300 mm in length, 260 mm wide, and 270 mm in height, constructed to established designs. The front and top were transparent, allowing the experimenter to observe the behavior of the animal inside the apparatus. The chamber was divided into two compartments, separated by a central shutter that contained a small opening 50 mm wide and 75 mm high set close to the front of the chamber. The smaller of the compartments measured 9 mm in width and contained a low-power (6V) illumination source. The larger compartment measured 210 mm in width and was not illuminated. The floor of this dark compartment consisted of a grid of 16 horizontal stainless-steel bars that were 5mm in diameter and spaced 12.5 mm apart. A current generator supplied 0.75 mA to the grid floor, which was scrambled once every 0.5 s across the 16 bars. A resistance range of 40-60 microohms was calculated for a control group of rats and the apparatus was calibrated accordingly. An electronic circuit detecting the resistance of the animal ensured an accurate current delivery by automatic variation of the voltage with change in resistance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis experiment was carried out as described previously (Fox et al., 1995). Adult male Wistar rats weighing 200-230 g were used. Animals were brought to the laboratory 1 h before the experiment. On the day of training, animals were placed facing the rear of the light compartment of the apparatus. The timer was started once the animal has completely turned to face the front of the chamber. Latency to enter the dark chamber was recorded (usually < 20 s), and having completely entered the dark compartment an inescapable foot shock of 0.75 mA for 3 s was administered to the animal. Animals were then returned to their home cages. Between each training session, both compartments of the chamber were cleaned to remove any confounding olfactory cues. Recall of this inhibitory stimulus was evaluated 24 h, 72 h and on 7 day post-training by returning the animal into the light chamber and recording their latency to enter the dark chamber, a criterion time of 300 s was employed. Some of the compounds showed significant increase in latency to reach the dark zone, at 10 mg/Kg oral dose. Reference: (a) \nCallahan P. M., Ilch C. P., Rowe N.

Binding of an agonist to the human 5-HT\n6\n receptor will lead to an increase in adenyl cyclase activity. A compound that is an agonist will show an increase in cAMP production and a compound that is an antagonist will block the agonist effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman 5-HT\n6\n receptors were cloned and stably expressed in HEK-293 cells. These cells were plated in 6 well plates in DMEM/F 12 media with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 500 ug/mL G418 and incubated at 37° C. in a CO\n2\n incubator. The cells were allowed to grow to about 70 % confluence before initiation of the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the culture media was removed, and the cells were washed once with serum free medium (SFM). Two mL of SFM + IBMX media was added and incubated at 37° C. for 10 min. The media were removed and fresh SFM+IBMX media containing various compounds, and 1 uM serotonin (as antagonist) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 min. Following incubation, the media were removed and the cells were washed once with 1 mL of PBS (phosphate buffered saline). Each well was treated with 1 mL cold 95% ethanol and 5 mM EDTA (2:1) at 4° C. for 1 hour. The cells were then scraped and transferred into Eppendorf tubes. The tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 4° C., and the supernatants were stored at 4° C. until assayed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncAMP content was determined by EIA (enzyme-immunoassay) using the Amersham Biotrak cAMP EIA kit (Amersham RPN 225). The procedure used is as described for the kit. Briefly, cAMP is determined by the competition between unlabeled cAMP and a fixed quantity of peroxidase-labelled cAMP for the binding sites on anti-cAMP antibody. The antibody is immobilized onto polystyrene microtitre wells precoated with a second antibody. The reaction is started by adding 50 uL, peroxidase-labeled cAMP to the sample (100 uL) preincubated with the antiserum (100 uL) for 2 hours at 4° C. Following 1 hour incubation at 4° C., the unbound ligand is separated by a simple washing procedure. Then an enzyme substrate, trimethylbenzidine (1), is added and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The reaction is stopped by the addition of 100 uL 1.0 M sulphuric acid and the resultant color read by a microtitre plate spectrophotometer at 450 nM within 30 minutes. In the functional adenylyl cyclase assay, some of the compound of this invention was found to be a competitive antagonist with good selectivity over a number of other receptors including other serotonin receptors such as 5-HT\n1A\n and 5-HT\n7\n."

The\n\n\nSequence Listing is provided as a file entitled CORE0074WOSEQ.txt, created on June 23, 2008 which is 24 Kb in size. The information in the electronic format of the sequence listing is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention provides compositions comprising oligomeric compounds that modulate gene expression. In one embodiment, such modulation is via the RNA interference pathway. The modified oligomeric compounds of the invention comprise motifs that can enhance various physical properties and attributes compared to wild type nucleic acids. More particularly, the modification of the sense strand while maintaing a particular motif in the antisense strand enables enhancing the efficiency of the two strands for their particular roles in a selected pathway such as the RNAi pathway. The compositions of the present invention further include a fully modified antisense strand that has 2'-OCH\n3\n modified nucleosides that define a positional motif with 2'-F modified nucleosides in the remaining positions for essentially the entire length of the hybridizing region. The sense strand is a continuous sequence of nucleosides that define a motif. The compositions can include one or more 3 '-capping groups, 5 '-capping groups, 5'-phosphate moieties, 3'-linked conjugate groups, non hybridizing 3'-overhang regions and a non hybridizing 3'-overhang regions that are linked to a conjugate group. The compositions can further include varying numbers of phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages that enhance the in vivo activity. The compositions are useful in one aspect for targeting selected nucleic acid molecules and modulating the expression of one or more genes. In some embodiments, the compositions of the present invention hybridize to a portion of a target RNA resulting in loss of normal function of the target RNA. \n\n Background of the Invention\n\n\nIn many species, introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces potent and specific gene silencing. This phenomenon occurs in both plants and animals and has roles in viral defense and transposon silencing mechanisms. This phenomenon was originally described more than a decade ago by researchers working with the petunia flower. While trying to deepen the purple color of these flowers, Jorgensen et al. introduced a pigment-producing gene under the control of a powerful promoter. Instead of the expected deep purple color, many of the flowers appeared variegated or even white. Jorgensen named the observed phenomenon \"cosuppression\", since the expression of both the introduced gene and the homologous endogenous gene was suppressed (Napoli et al., Plant Cell, 1990, 2, 279-289; Jorgensen et al., Plant MoI. Biol., 1996, 31, 957-973).\n\n\nCosuppression has since been found to occur in many species of plants, fungi, and has been particularly well characterized in Neurospora crassa, where it is known as \"quelling\" (Cogoni et al., Genes Dev., 2000, 10, 638-643; Guru, Nature, 2000, 404, 804-808). The first evidence that dsRNA could lead to gene silencing in animals came from work in the nematode, C. elegans. In 1995, researchers Guo and Kemphues were attempting to use antisense RNA to shut down expression of the par-1 gene in order to assess its function. As expected, injection of the antisense RNA disrupted expression of par-1, but quizzically, injection of the sense-strand control also disrupted expression (Guo et al., Cell, 1995, 81, 611-620). This result was a puzzle until Fire et al. injected dsRNA (a mixture of both sense and antisense strands) into C. elegans. This injection resulted in much more efficient silencing than injection of either the sense or the antisense strands alone. Injection of just a few molecules of dsRNA per cell was sufficient to completely silence the homologous gene's expression. Furthermore, injection of dsRNA into the gut of the worm caused gene silencing not only throughout the worm, but also in first generation offspring (Fire et al., Nature, 1998, 391, 806-811).\n\n\nThe potency of this phenomenon led Timmons and Fire to explore the limits of the dsRNA effects by feeding nematodes bacteria that had been engineered to express dsRNA homologous to the C. elegans unc-22 gene. Surprisingly, these worms developed an unc-22 null- like phenotype (Timmons et al., Nature, 1998, 395, 854; Timmons et al., Gene, 2001, 263, 103- 112). Further work showed that soaking worms in dsRNA was also able to induce silencing (Tabara et al., Science, 1998, 282, 430-431). PCT publication WO 01/48183 discloses methods of inhibiting expression of a target gene in a nematode worm involving feeding to the worm a food organism which is capable of producing a double-stranded RNA structure having a \n\n nucleotide sequence substantially identical to a portion of the target gene following ingestion of the food organism by the nematode, or by introducing a DNA capable of producing the double- stranded RNA structure.\n\n\nThe posttranscriptional gene silencing defined in C. elegans resulting from exposure to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) has since been designated as RNA interference (RNAi). This term has come to generalize all forms of gene silencing involving dsRNA leading to the sequence-specific reduction of endogenous targeted mRNA levels; unlike co-suppression, in which transgenic DNA leads to silencing of both the transgene and the endogenous gene.\n\n\nIntroduction of exogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into C. elegans has been shown to specifically and potently disrupt the activity of genes containing homologous sequences. Montgomery et al. suggests that the primary interference effects of dsRNA are posttranscriptional; this conclusion being derived from examination of the primary DNA sequence after dsRNA-mediated interference a finding of no evidence of alterations followed by studies involving alteration of an upstream operon having no effect on the activity of its downstream gene. These results argue against an effect on initiation or elongation of transcription. Finally they observed by in situ hybridization, that dsRNA-mediated interference produced a substantial, although not complete, reduction in accumulation of nascent transcripts in the nucleus, while cytoplasmic accumulation of transcripts was virtually eliminated. These results indicate that the endogenous mRNA is the primary target for interference and suggest a mechanism that degrades the targeted mRNA before translation can occur. It was also found that this mechanism is not dependent on the SMG system, an mRNA surveillance system in C. elegans responsible for targeting and destroying aberrant messages. The authors further suggest a model of how dsRNA might function as a catalytic mechanism to target homologous mRNAs for degradation. (Montgomery et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A, 1998, 95, 15502-15507). The development of a cell-free system from syncytial blastoderm Drosophila embryos that recapitulates many of the features of RNAi has been reported. The interference observed in this reaction is sequence specific, is promoted by dsRNA but not single-stranded RNA, functions by specific mRNA degradation, and requires a minimum length of dsRNA. Furthermore, preincubation of dsRNA potentiates its activity demonstrating that RNAi can be mediated by sequence-specific processes in soluble reactions (Tuschl et al., Genes Dev., 1999, 13, 3191- 3197).\n\n\nIn subsequent experiments, Tuschl et al, using the Drosophila in vitro system, demonstrated that 21- and 22-nt RNA fragments are the sequence-specific mediators of RNAi. \n\n These fragments, which they termed short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were shown to be generated by an RNase Ill-like processing reaction from long dsRNA. They also showed that chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes with overhanging 3' ends mediate efficient target RNA cleavage in the Drosophila lysate, and that the cleavage site is located near the center of the region spanned by the guiding siRNA. In addition, they suggest that the direction of dsRNA processing determines whether sense or antisense target RNA can be cleaved by the siRNA- protein complex (Elbashir et al., Genes Dev., 2001, 15, 188-200). Further characterization of the suppression of expression of endogenous and heterologous genes caused by the 21-23 nucleotide siRNAs have been investigated in several mammalian cell lines, including human embryonic kidney (293) and HeLa cells (Elbashir et al., Nature, 2001, 411, 494-498).\n\n\nTijsterman et al. have shown that, in fact, single-stranded RNA oligomers of antisense polarity can be potent inducers of gene silencing. As is the case for co-suppression, they showed that antisense RNAs act independently of the RNAi genes rde-1 and rde-4 but require the mutator/RNAi gene mut-7 and a putative DEAD box RNA helicase, mut-14. According to the authors, their data favor the hypothesis that gene silencing is accomplished by RNA primer extension using the mRNA as template, leading to dsRNA that is subsequently degraded suggesting that single-stranded RNA oligomers are ultimately responsible for the RNAi phenomenon (Tijsterman et al., Science, 2002, 295, 694-697).\n\n\nSeveral other publications have described the structural requirements for the dsRNA trigger required for RNAi activity. Recent reports have indicated that ideal dsRNA sequences are 21nt in length containing 2 nt 3 '-end overhangs (Elbashir et al, EMBO (2001), 20, 6877- 6887, Sabine Brantl, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 2002, 1575, 15-25.) In this system, substitution of the 4 nucleosides from the 3 '-end with 2'-deoxynucleosides has been demonstrated to not affect activity. On the other hand, substitution with 2'-deoxynucleosides or 2'-OMe-nucleosides throughout the sequence (sense or antisense) was shown to be deleterious to RNAi activity.\n\n\nInvestigation of the structural requirements for RNA silencing in C. elegans has demonstrated modification of the internucleotide linkage (phosphorothioate) to not interfere with activity (Parrish et al., Molecular Cell, 2000, 6, 1077-1087.) It was also shown by Parrish et al., that chemical modification like 2'-amino or 5'-iodouridine are well tolerated in the sense strand but not the antisense strand of the dsRNA suggesting differing roles for the 2 strands in RNAi. Base modification such as guanine to inosine (where one hydrogen bond is lost) has been demonstrated to decrease RNAi activity independently of the position of the modification (sense \n\n or antisense). Same \"position independent\" loss of activity has been observed following the introduction of mismatches in the dsRNA trigger. Some types of modifications, for example introduction of sterically demanding bases such as 5-iodoU, have been shown to be deleterious to RNAi activity when positioned in the antisense strand, whereas modifications positioned in the sense strand were shown to be less detrimental to RNAi activity. As was the case for the 21 nt dsRNA sequences, RNA-DNA heteroduplexes did not serve as triggers for RNAi. However, dsRNA containing 2'-F-2'-deoxynucleosides appeared to be efficient in triggering RNAi response independent of the position (sense or antisense) of the 2'-F-2'-deoxynucleosides.\n\n\nIn one experiment the reduction of gene expression was studied using electroporated dsRNA and a 25mer morpholino in post implantation mouse embryos (Mellitzer et al.,\n\n\nMehanisms of Development, 2002, 118, 57-63). The morpholino oligomer did show activity but was not as effective as the dsRNA.\n\n\nA number of PCT applications have been published that relate to the RNAi phenomenon. These include: PCT publication WO 00/44895; PCT publication WO 00/49035; PCT publication WO 00/63364; PCT publication WO 01/36641 ; PCT publication WO\n\n\n01/36646; PCT publication WO 99/32619; PCT publication WO 00/44914; PCT publication WO 01/29058; and PCT publication WO 01/75164.\n\n\nU.S. patents 5,898,031 and 6,107,094 describe certain oligonucleotide having RNA like properties. When hybridized with RNA, these olibonucleotides serve as substrates for a dsRNase enzyme with resultant cleavage of the RNA by the enzyme.\n\n\nIn another published paper (Martinez et al., Cell, 2002, 110, 563-574) it was shown that double stranded as well as single stranded siRNA resides in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) together with elF2Cl and elf2C2 (human GERp950 Argonaute proteins. The activity of 5'-phosphorylated single stranded siRNA was comparable to the double stranded siRNA in the system studied. In a related study, the inclusion of a 5'-phosphate moiety was shown to enhance activity of siRNA's in vivo in Drosophila embryos (Boutla, et al., Curr. Biol., 2001, 11, 1776- 1780). In another study, it was reported that the 5'-phosphate was required for siRNA function in human HeLa cells (Schwarz et al., Molecular Cell, 2002, 10, 537-548).\n\n\nA wide variety of chemical modifications have been made to siRNA compositions to try to enhance properties including stability and potency relative to the unmodified compositions. Much of the early work looked at modification of one strand while keeping the other strand unmodified. More recent work has focused on modification of both strands. \n\n One group is working on modifying both strands of siRNA duplexes such that each strand has an alternating pattern wherein each nucleoside or a block of modified nucleosides is alternating with unmodified β-D-ribonucleosides. The chemical modification used in the modified portion is 2'-OCH\n3\n modified nucleosides (see European publication EP 1389637 Al, published on February 18, 2004 and PCT publication WO2004015107 published on February 19, 2004).\n\n\nAnother group has prepared a number of siRNA constructs with modifications in both strands (see PCT publication WO03/070918 published on August 28, 2003). The constructs disclosed generally have modified nucleosides dispersed in a pattern that is dictated by which strand is being modified and further by the positioning of the purines and pyrimidines in that strand. In general the purines are 2'-OCH\n3\n or 2'-H and pyrimidines are 2'-F in the antisense strand and the purines are 2'-H and the pyrimidines are 2'-OCH\n3\n or 2'-F in the sense strand. According to the definitions used in the present application these constructs would appear to be positionally modified as there is no set motif to the substitution pattern and positionally modified can describe a random substitution pattern.\n\n\nCertain nucleoside compounds having bicyclic sugar moieties are known as locked nucleic acids or LNA (Koshkin et al., Tetrahedron 1998, 54, 3607-3630). These compounds are also referred to in the literature as bicyclic nucleotide analogs (Imanishi et al, International Patent Application WO 98/39352), but this term is also applicable to a genus of compounds that includes other analogs in addition to LNAs. Such modified nucleosides mimic the 3'-endo sugar conformation of native ribonucleosides with the advantage of having enhanced binding affinity and increased resistance to nucleases.\n\n\nOne group recently reported that the incorporation of bicyclic nucleosides, each having a 4'-CH\n2\n-O-2' bridge (LNA) into siRNA duplexes dramatically improved the half life in serum via enhanced nuclease resistance and also increased the duplex stability due to the increased affinity. This effect is seen with a minimum number of LNA's located as specific positions within the siRNA duplex. The placement of LNA's at the 5 '-end of the sense strand was shown to reduce the loading of this strand which reduces off target effects (see Elmen et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 2005, 33(1), 439-447). Some LNAs have a 2'-hydroxyl group linked to the 4' carbon atom of the sugar ring thereby forming a bicyclic sugar moiety. The linkage may be a methylene (-CH\n2\n-)\nn\n group bridging the 2' oxygen atom and the 4' carbon atom wherein n is 1 or 2 (Singh et al., Chem. \n\n Commun., 1998, 4, 455-456; Kaneko et al, U.S. Patent Application Publication No.: US 2002/0147332, also see Japanese Patent Application HEI-11-33863, February 12, 1999). U. S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0068708 discloses a number of nucleosides having a variety of bicyclic sugar moieties with the various bridges creating the bicyclic sugar having a variety of configurations and chemical composition.\n\n\nBraash et al., Biochemistry 2003, 42, 7967-7975 report improved thermal stability of LNA modified siRNA without compromising the efficiency of the siRNA. Grunweller, et. al., Nucleic Acid Research, 2003, 31, 3185-3193 discloses the potency of certain LNA gapmers and siRNAs. One group has identified a 9 base sequence within an siRNA duplex that elicits a sequence-specific TLR7-dependent immune response in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The immunostimulation was reduced by incorporating 4 bicyclic nucleosides, each having a 4'-CH\n2\n- O-2' bridge (LNA) at the 3 '-end of the sense strand. They also made 5' and both 3' and 5' versions of sense and antisense for incorporation into siRNA duplexes where one strand had the modified nucleosides and the other strand was unmodified (see Hornung et al., 2005, 11(3)1, 263-270).\n\n\nOne group of researchers used expression profiling to perform a genome wide analysis of the efficacy and specificity of siRNA induced silencing of two genes involved in signal transduction (insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFlR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK 14 or p38α). A unique expression profile was produced for each of the 8 siRNAs targeted to MAPK 14 and 16 siRNA's targeted to IGFlR indicating that off target effects were highly dependent on the particular sequence. These expression patterns were reproducable for each individual siRNA. The group determined that off target effects were caused by both the antisense strand and the sense strand of siRNA duplexes. There is a need for siRNA's that are designed to preferentially load only the antisense strand thereby reducing the off target effects caused by the sense strand also being loaded into the RISC.\n\n\nA number of published applications that are commonly assigned with the present application disclose double strand compositions wherein one or both of the strands comprise a particular motif. The motifs include hemimer motifs, blockmer motifs, gapped motifs, fully modified motifs, positionally modified motifs and alternating motifs (see published PCT applications: WO 2004/044133 published May 27, 2004, 3'-endo motifs; WO 2004/113496 published December 29, 2004, 3'-endo motifs; WO 2004/044136 published May 27, 2004, alternating motifs; WO 2004/044140 published May 27, 2004, 2'-modified motifs; WO \n\n2004/043977 published May 27, 2004, 2'-F motifs; WO 2004/043978 published May 27, 2004, 2'-OCH\n3\n motifs; WO 2004/041889 published May 21, 2004, polycyclic sugar motifs; WO 2004/043979 published May 27, 2004, sugar surrogate motifs; and WO 2004/044138 published May 27, 2004, chimeric motifs; also see published US Application US20050080246 published April 14, 2005).\n\n\nLike the RNAse H pathway, the RNA interference pathway of antisense modulation of gene expression is an effective means for modulating the levels of specific gene products and may therefore prove to be uniquely useful in a number of therapeutic, diagnostic, and research applications involving gene silencing. The present invention therefore further provides compositions useful for modulating gene expression pathways, including those relying on an antisense mechanism of action such as RNA interference and dsRNA enzymes as well as non- antisense mechanisms. One having skill in the art, once armed with this disclosure will be able, without undue experimentation, to identify additional compositions for these uses.\n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\nIn certain embodiements, the present invention provides compositions having first and second oligomeric compounds wherein the first oligomeric compound comprises a positional/full motif that either symmetric or asymmetric and the second oligomeric compound comprises a continuous sequence of nucleosides that define a motif selected from an alternating motif, a hemimer motif, a blockmer motif, a gapped motif, a positional motif, a positional/full motif and a fully modified motif. The motifs derive from the positioning of sugar modified nucleosides relative to other modified or unmodified nucleosides in a strand and are independent of the sequence, type of nucleobases (purine, pyrimidine or other) or type of internucleoside linkage. Each of the first and second oligomeric compounds can be further modified with one or more groups selected from a 3'-capping group, a 5'-capping group, a 5'-phosphate moiety, a linked conjugate group, a non hybridizing 3 '-overhang region and a non hybridizing 3 '-overhang region that is linked to a conjugate group.\n\n\nIn certain embodiements, the first oligomeric compound comprises a hybridizing region that is essentially fully complementary to the second oligomeric compound and also to a nucleic acid target. In certain embodiements, the hybridizing region of the first olgomeric compound comprises a continuous sequence of linked nucleosides that define a positional/full motif having the formula:\n\n\n5'-(N\ni\n-L)\n2\n-(N\nm\n-L)\n3\n-(N\nn\n-L)\n2\n-(N\nm\n-L)\n2\n-(N\nn\n-L)\n2\n-(N\nm\n-L)\n5\n-(N\nn\n-L)\n3\n-3' \n\n wherein, each Nj is, independently, a 4'-thio modified nucleoside or a 2'-F modified nucleoside; each N\nm\n is a 2'-F modified nucleoside; each N\nn\n is a 2'-OCH\n3\n modified nucleoside and each L is an internucleoside linkage.\n\n\nIn certain embodiements, the present invention provides compositions comprising first and second oligomeric compounds wherein each oligomeric compound independently has a hybridizing region of 19 nucleosides wherein essentially each of the nucleosides of the second oligomeric compound are complementary to and hybridize to the first oligomeric compound. In certain embodiements, the second oliogmeric compound is fully complementary to the first oliogmeric compound. In certain embodiements,one or more mismatches, modified nucleosides (e.g. abasic, acyclic et al.,) or non nucleosides are also contemplated at one or more positions within one or both hybridizing regions.\n\n\nThe first oligomeric compound optionally further includes a 5 '-phosphate moiety and a non hybridizing 3'-overhang region comprising from 1 to about 2 2'-modified nucleosides. In a preferred embodiment at least one of these non hybridizing 2'-modified nucleosides has increased nuclease resistance relative to a β-D-2'-deoxyribonucleoside being located at the same position. In a more preferred embodiment all of the 2'-modified nucleosides located in the non hybridizing 3 '-overhang regions have increased nuclease resistance relative to a β-D-2'- deoxyribonucleoside being located at the same positions. Such 2'-modified nucleosides can be further modified such as for example 4'-S and/or 5'-modified. 2'-Modified nucleosides are meant to include 2'-substituted nucleosides as well as bicyclic nucleosides (wherein one point of attachment for the second ring is the 2'-position such as for example 4'-(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-O-2' where n is 1 or 2. In one embodiment the non hybridizing 3'-overhang region comprises 2'-modified nucleosides. In another embodiment the second oligomeric compound has a 5'-hydroxyl or 5'- protected hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment the first oligomeric compound includes a 5'-posphate group and a 3'-overhang region and the second oligomeric compound includes a 3'- overhang region and or a 3'-linked conjugate group.\n\n\nThe second oligomeric compound opitonally includes a 3 '-overhang region comprising from 1 to about 2 2'-modified nucleosides, a linked conjugate group or both wherein the conjugate group is linked to the 3'-overhang region. In a preferred embodiment at least one of these non hybridizing 2'-modified nucleosides, when present, has increased nuclease resistance relative to a β-D-2'-deoxyribonucleoside being located at the same position. In a more preferred embodiment all of the non hybridizing 2'-modified nucleosides have increased nuclease resistance relative to a β-D-2'-deoxyribonucleoside being located at the same positions. Such 2'- \n\n modified nucleosides can be further modified such as for example 4'-S and/or 5'-modified. 2'- Modified nucleosides are meant to include 2'-substituted nucleosides as well as bicyclic nucleosides (wherein one point of attachment for the second ring is the 2'-position such as for example 4'-(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-O-2' where n is 1 or 2. In one embodiment the non hybridizing 3'-overhang region comprises 2'-modified nucleosides. In another embodiment the second oligomeric compound does not comprise a non hybridizing 3 '-overhang region.\n\n\nThe second oligomeric compound optionally comprises a linked conjugate group. A large number of conjugate groups are known to the art skilled that would be amenable to the present invention. Attachment of conjugate groups is also well known in the art and any and all such linkages are envisioned by the present invention. In one embodiment the second oligomeric compound comprises a non hybridizing region, a phosphorothioate group, a linker and a conjugate group. In another embodiment the optional non hybridizing region is omitted. One representative formula for a linked conjugate is shown below for illustration and is not meant to be limiting:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe formula includes a C\n16\n lipophilic conjugate attached via a pyrrolidinyl linker to a phosphororthioate group. The phosphorothioate group can be attached directly to the 3'-end of the second oligomeric compound or can be attached to the 3'-terminal non hybridizing nucleoside. The second oligomeric compound (sense strand) comprises a continuous sequence of nucleosides that define a motif selected from an alternating motif, a hemimer motif, a blockmer motif, a gapped motif, a positional motif, a positional/full motif or a fully modified motif. The sense strand is useful in, for example, influencing the preferential loading of the opposite strand into the RISC (or cleavage) complex. In particular, the present invention provides oligomeric compounds that comprise chemical modifications in the sense strand to drive loading of the antisense strand (first oligomeric compound) into the RISC (or cleavage) complex. Such modifications can be used to increase potency of duplex constructs that have been modified to enhance stability. Examples of chemical 2'-sugar modifications that are especially efficient in motifs that enhance the loading of the antisense strand relative to the sense strand include, but are not limited to, F, MOE (2'-O(CH\n2\n)\n2\nOCH\n3\n), 2'-O-methyl, -ethyl, -propyl, -O-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-O- N(CH\n3\n)\n2\n , -O-CH\n2\n-C(=O)-N(H)(CH\n2\n)\n2\nN(CH\n3\n)\n2\n, -O-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-O-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-N(CH\n3\n)\n2;\n -N- \n\n methylacetamide and 4'-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-O-2' (n is 1 or 2). Such modifications can be used alone or in combination with sugar modifed nucleosides including but not limited to 2'-H, 2'-OH, 2'-F and others. Such modifications can be distributed throughout the strand to define an alternating, positional, positional/full, full or blockmer motif or placed at one or both of the 5' and/or 3' ends to make a gapmer or hemimer motif on the sense strand. The compositions are useful for targeting selected nucleic acid molecules and modulating the expression of one or more genes. In some embodiments, the compositions of the present invention hybridize to a portion of a target RNA resulting in loss of normal function of the target RNA. Detailed Description\n\n\nVarious compositions comprising the motif combinations of the present invention have been shown to have enhanced properties. The properties that can be enhanced include, but are not limited, to modulation of pharmacokinetic properties through modification of protein binding, protein off-rate, absorption and clearance; modulation of nuclease stability as well as chemical stability; modulation of the binding affinity and specificity of the oligomer (affinity and specificity for enzymes as well as for complementary sequences); and increasing efficacy of RNA cleavage.\n\n\nThe compositions of the present invention are useful for, for example, modulating gene expression. For example, a targeted cell, group of cells, a tissue or an animal is contacted with a composition of the invention to effect reduction of mRNA that can directly inhibit gene expression. In another embodiment, the reduction of mRNA can indirectly upregulate a non- targeted gene through a pathway that relates the targeted gene to a non-targeted gene. Numerous methods and models for the regulation of genes using compositions of the invention are illustrated in the art and in the example section below. The compositions of the invention modulate gene expression by hybridizing to a nucleic acid target resulting in loss of its normal function. As used herein, the term \"target nucleic acid\" or \"nucleic acid target\" is used for convenience to encompass any nucleic acid capable of being targeted including without limitation DNA, RNA (including pre-mRNA and mRNA or portions thereof) transcribed from such DNA, and also cDNA derived from such RNA. In some embodiments, the target nucleic acid is a messenger RNA. In another embodiment, the degradation of the targeted messenger RNA is facilitated by an activated RISC complex that is formed with compositions of the invention. In another embodiment, the degradation of the targeted messenger RNA is facilitated by a nuclease such as RNaseH. \n\n As used in the present invention the term \"gapped motif is meant to include a contiguous sequence of nucleosides that are divided into 3 regions, an internal region flanked by two external regions. The regions are differentiated from each other at least by having different sugar groups that comprise the nucleosides. The types of nucleosides that are used to differentiate the regions of a gapped oligomeric compound include β-D-ribonucleosides, 2'- modified nucleosides, 4'-thio modified nucleosides, 4'-thio-2'-modified nucleosides, and bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides. Each region is uniformly modified e.g. the sugar groups are identical. The internal region or the gap generally comprises β-D-ribonucleosides but can be a sequence of sugar modified nucleosides. The nucleosides located in the gap of a gapped oligomeric compound have different sugar groups than both of the wings.\n\n\nGapped oligomeric compounds are further defined as being either \"symmetric\" or \"asymmetric\". A gapmer having the same uniform sugar modification in each of the wings is termer a symmetric gapped oligomeric compound. A gapmer having different uniform modifications in each wing is termed an asymmetric gapped oligomeric compound. Gapped oligomeric compounds such as these can have for example both wings comprising 4'-thio modified nucleosides (symmetric gapmer) and a gap comprising β-D-ribonucleosides or modified nucleosides other than 4'-thio modified nucleosides. Asymmetric gapped oligomeric compounds for example can have one wing comprising 2'-OCH\n3\n modified nucleosides and the other wing comprising 4'-thio modified nucleosides with the internal region (gap) comprising β- D-ribonucleosides or sugar modified nucleosides that are other than 4'-thio or 2'-OCH\n3\n modified nucleosides.\n\n\nGapped oligomeric compounds as used in the present invention include wings that independently have from 1 to about 6 nucleosides. Suitable wings comprise from 1 to about 4 nucleosides and can comprise wings comprising from 1 to about 3 nucleosides. The number of nucleosides in each wing can be the same or different. The present invention therefore includes gapped oligomeric compounds wherein each wing independently comprises 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 sugar modified nucleosides.\n\n\nAs used in the present invention the term \"alternating motif is meant to include a contiguous sequence of nucleosides comprising two different nucleosides that alternate for essentially the entire sequence of the oligomeric compound. The pattern of alternation can be described by the formula: 5'-A(-L-B-L-A)n(-L-B)\nnn\n-3' where A and B are nucleosides differentiated by having at least different sugar groups, each L is an internucleoside linking group, nn is 0 or 1 and n is from about 7 to about 11. This permits alternating oligomeric \n\n compounds from about 17 to about 24 nucleosides in length. This length range is not meant to be limiting as longer and shorter oligomeric compounds are also amenable to the present invention. This formula also allows for even and odd lengths for alternating oligomeric compounds wherein the 3' and 5'-terminal nucleosides are the same (odd) or different (even). The \"A\" and \"B\" nucleosides comprising alternating oligomeric compounds of the present invention are differentiated from each other by having at least different sugar moieties. Each of the A and B nucleosides is selected from β-D-ribonucleosides, 2'-modified nucleosides, 4'-thio modified nucleosides, 4'-thio-2'-modified nucleosides, and bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides. The alternating motif includes the alternation of nucleosides having different sugar groups but is independent from the nucleobase sequence and the internucleoside linkages. The internucleoside linkage can vary at each or selected locations or can be uniform or alternating throughout the oligomeric compound.\n\n\nAlternating oligomeric compounds of the present invention can be designed to function as the sense or the antisense strand. Alternating 2'-OCH\n3\n/2'-F modified oligomeric compounds have been used as the antisense strand and have shown good activity with a variety of sense strands. One antisense oligomeric compound comprising an alternating motif is a 19mer wherein the A's are 2'-OCH\n3\n modified nucleosides and the B's are 2'-F modified nucleosides (nn is 0 and n is 9). The resulting alternating oligomeric compound will have a register wherein the 3' and 5'-ends are both 2'-OCH\n3\n modified nucleosides. Alternating oligomeric compounds have been designed to function as the sense strand also. The chemistry or register is generally different than for the oligomeric compounds designed for the antisense strand. When a alternating 2'-F/2'-OCH\n3\n modified 19mer was paired with the antisense strand in the previous paragraph the preferred orientation was determined to be an offset register wherein both the 3' and 5 '-ends of the sense strand were 2'-F modified nucleosides. In a matched register the sugar modifications match between hybridized nucleosides so all the terminal ends of a 19mer would have the same sugar modification. Another alternating motif that has been tested and works in the sense strand is β-D-ribonucleosides alternating with 2'-MOE modified nucleosides.\n\n\nAs used in the present invention the term \"fully modified motif or \"full motif is meant to include a contiguous sequence of sugar modified nucleosides wherein essentially each nucleoside is modified to have the same sugar modification. Suitable sugar modified nucleosides for fully modified strands of the invention include 2'-F, 4'-thio and 2'-OCH\n3\n with 2'- OCH\n3\n particularly suitable. In one aspect the 3' and 5'-terminal nucleosides are unmodified. \n\n As used in the present invention the term \"hemimer motif is meant to include a sequence of nucleosides that have uniform sugar moieties (identical sugars, modified or unmodified) and wherein one of the 5 '-end or the 3 '-end has a sequence of from 2 to 12 nucleosides that are sugar modified nucleosides that are different from the other nucleosides in the hemimer modified oligomeric compound. An example of a typical hemimer is an oligomeric compound comprising β-D-ribonucleosides that have a sequence of sugar modified nucleosides at one of the termini. In one embodiment the hemimer motif includes a sequence of β-D- ribonucleosides having from 2-12 sugar modified nucleosides located at one of the termini. In another embodiment the hemimer motif includes a sequence of β-D-ribonucleosides having from 2-6 sugar modified nucleosides located at one of the termini with from 2-4 sugar modified nucleosides being preferred.\n\n\nAs used in the present invention the term \"blockmer motif is meant to include a sequence of nucleosides that have uniform sugars (identical sugars, modified or unmodified) that is internally interrupted by a block of sugar modified nucleosides that are uniformly modified and wherein the modification is different from the other nucleosides. More generally, oligomeric compounds having a blockmer motif comprise a sequence of β-D-ribonucleosides having one internal block of from 2 to about 6, or from 2 to about 4 sugar modified nucleosides. The internal block region can be at any position within the oligomeric compound as long as it is not at one of the termini which would then make it a hemimer. The base sequence and internucleoside linkages can vary at any position within a blockmer motif.\n\n\nAs used in the present invention the term \"positionally modified motif is meant to include a sequence of β-D-ribonucleosides wherein the sequence is interrupted by two or more regions comprising from 1 to about 4 sugar modified nucleosides. The positionally modified motif includes internal regions of sugar modified nucleoside and can also include one or both termini. Each particular sugar modification within a region of sugar modified nucleosides is variable with uniform modification desired. The sugar modified regions can have the same sugar modification or can vary such that one region may have a different sugar modification than another region. Positionally modified strands comprise at least two sugar modified regions and at least three when both the 3' and 5 '-termini comprise sugar modified regions. Positionally modified oligomeric compounds are distinguished from gapped motifs, hemimer motifs, blockmer motifs and alternating motifs because the pattern of regional substitution defined by any positional motif is not defined by these other motifs. Positionally modified motifs are not determined by the nucleobase sequence or the location or types of internucleoside linkages. The \n\n term positionally modified oligomeric compound includes many different specific substitution patterns. A number of these substitution patterns have been prepared and tested in compositions. As used in the present invention the term \"positional/full motif is meant to include a sequence of uniformly sugar modified nucleosides wherein the sequence is interrupted by two or more regions comprising from 1 to about 4 sugar modified nucleosides or 2'- deoxyribonucleosides. The positional/full motif is identical to the positional motif except that the β-D-ribonucleosides are replaced with sugar modified nucleosides.\n\n\nThe terms symmetric and asymmetric as applied to a positional or a positional/full motif refer to the two or more regions of sugar modified nucleosides. When each sugar modified nucleoside in the the two or more regions of sugar modified nucleosides have the same sugar modification the positional motif is a symmetric positional or symmetric positional/full motif.\n\n\nWhen one or more of the sugar modified nucleosides in the two or more regions of sugar modified nucleosides have different sugar modifications then the positional motif is an asymmetric positional or an asymmetric positional/full motif. A list of substitution patterns corresponding to positionally modified oligomeric compounds illustrated in the examples are shown below. This list is meant to be instructive and not limiting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* indicates that more than one type of sugar modified nucleosides were used in the sugar modified regions.\n\n\nCertain sense strands amenable to the present invention includes but is not limited to the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll non-annotated nucleosides are β-D-ribonucleosides linked by phosphodiester internucleoside linkages. Phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages are indicated by underlining. Modified nucleosides are indicated by a subscripted letter following the capital letter indicating the nucleoside. In particular, subscript \"f\" indicates 2'-fluoro; subscript \"m\" indicates 2'-O-methyl; subscript \"1\" indicates LNA; subscript \"e\" indicates 2'-O-methoxyethyl (MOE); subscript \"p\" indicates 2'-O-propyl; and subscript \"t\" indicates 4'-thio. For example U\nm\n is a modified uridine having a 2'-OCH\n3\n group. A \"d\" preceding a nucleoside indicates a deoxynucleoside such as dT which is deoxythymidine. Some of the strands have a 5 '-phosphate group designated as \"P-\". Bolded and italicized \"C\" indicates a 5-methyl C ribonucleoside. Where noted next to the ISIS number of a compound, \"as\" designates the antisense strand, and \"s\" designates the sense strand of the duplex, with respect to the target sequence.\n\n\nThe specific sequences here and throughout the speicification are provided only as examples. Thus, while certain motifs are exemplified using certain sequences, it is to be understood that other sequences could easily be prepared using the same motif of modifications. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, for the purposes of defining a motif, each nucleoside in the sequences herein may be substituted with \"N\" which indicates any base.\n\n\nThe term \"sugar modified nucleosides\" as used in the present invention is intended to include all manner of sugar modifications known in the art. The sugar modified nucleosides can have any heterocyclic base moiety and internucleoside linkage and may include further groups independent from the sugar modification. One group of preferred sugar modified nucleosides includes 2'-modified nucleosides, 4'-thio modified nucleosides, 4'-thio-2'-modified nucleosides, and bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides.\n\n\nThe term \"2'-modified nucleoside\" as used in the present invention is intended to include all manner of nucleosides having a 2'-substituent group that is other than H and OH. Suitable 2'-substituent groups for 2'-modified nucleosides of the invention include, but are not limited to: halo, allyl, amino, azido, amino, SH, CN, OCN, CF\n3\n, OCF\n3\n, O-, S-, or N(R\nm\n)-alkyl; O-, S-, or N(R\nm\n)-alkenyl; O-, S- or N(R\nm\n)-alkynyl; O-alkylenyl-0-alkyl, alkynyl, alkaryl, aralkyl, O-alkaryl, O-aralkyl, O(CH\n2\n)\n2\nSCH\n3\n, 0-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-O-N(R\nm\n)(R\nn\n) or O-CH\n2\n-C(=O)- \n\nN(R\nm\n)(R\nn\n), where each R\nm\n and R\nn\n is, independently, H, an amino protecting group or substituted or unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl. These 2'-substituent groups can be further substituted with substituent groups selected from hydroxyl, amino, alkoxy, carboxy, benzyl, phenyl, nitro (NO\n2\n), thiol, thioalkoxy (S-alkyl), halogen, alkyl, aryl, alkenyl and alkynyl where each R\nm\n is, independently, H, an amino protecting group or substituted or unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl.\n\n\nA list of 2'-substituent groups includes F, -NH\n2\n, N\n3\n, OCF\n3,\n 0-CH\n3\n, O(CH\n2\n)\n3\nNH\n2\n), CH\n2\n- CH=CH\n2\n, -0-CH\n2\n-CH=CH\n2\n, OCH\n2\nCH\n2\nOCH\n3\n, 2'-O(CH\n2\n)\n2\nSCH\n3\n, O-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-O-N(R\nm\n)(R\nn\n), -O(CH\n2\n)\n2\nO(CH\n2\n)\n2\nN(CH\n3\n)\n2\n, and N-substituted acetamide (O-CH\n2\n-C(=O)-N(R\nm\n)(R\nn\n) where each R\nm\n and R\nn\n is, independently, H, an amino protecting group or substituted or unsubstituted C\n1\n -C\n10\n alkyl. Another list of 2'-substituent groups includes F, OCF\n3,\n 0-CH\n3\n, OCH\n2\nCH\n2\nOCH\n3\n, 2'- O(CH\n2\n)\n2\nSCH\n3\n, O-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-O-N(R\nm\n)(R\nn\n), -O(CH\n2\n)\n2\nO(CH\n2\n)\n2\nN(CH\n3\n)\n2\n, and N-substituted acetamides (O-CH\n2\n-C(=O)-N(R\nm\n)(R\nn\n) where each R\nm\n and R\nn\n is, independently, H, an amino protecting group or substituted or unsubstituted C\n1\n-C\n10\n alkyl.\n\n\nAlso amenable to the present invention is the manipulation of the stereochemistry of the basic furanose ring system which can be prepared in a number of different configurations. The attachment of the heterocyclic base to the l'-position can result in the α-anomer (down) or the β-anomer (up). The β-anomer is the anomer found in native DNA and RNA but both forms can be used to prepare oligomeric compounds. A further manipulation can be achieved through the substitution the native form of the furanose with the enantiomeric form e.g. replacement of a native D-furanose with its mirror image enantiomer, the L-furanose. Another way to manipulate the furanose ring system is to prepare stereoisomers such as for example substitution at the 2'- position to give either the ribofuranose (down) or the arabinofuranose (up) or substitution at the 3 '-position to give the xylofuranose or by altering the 2', and the 3 '-position simultaneously to give a xylofuranose. The use of stereoisomers of the same substituent can give rise to completely different conformational geometry such as for example 2'-F which is 3'-endo in the ribo configuration and 2'-endo in the arabino configuration. The use of different anomeric and stereoisomeric sugars in oligomeric compounds is known in the art and amenable to the present invention.\n\n\nThe term \"4'-thio modified nucleoside\" is intended to include β-D-ribonucleosides having the 4'-0 replaced with 4'-S. The term \"4'-thio-2'-modified nucleoside\" is intended to include 4'-thio modified nucleosides having the 2'-OH replaced with a 2'-substituent group. The preparation of 4'-thio modified nucleosides is disclosed in publications such as for example U.S. Patent 5,639,837 issued June 17, 1997 and PCT publication WO 2005/027962 published on \n\n March 31 , 2005. The preparation of 4'-thio-2'-modified nucleosides and their incorporation into oligonucleotides is disclosed in the PCT publication WO 2005/027962 published on March 31 , 2005.

Nucleosides can be modified at the 5'-position with substituent groups. Racemic as well as both R and S isomers can be prepared. Various 5'-modified nucleosides have been prepared and reported in the patent literature as well as in scientific literature, see for example: Mikhailov et al, Nucleosides and Nucleotides, 1991, 10, 393-343; Saha et al, J.

Such bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides can incorporate a number of different bridging groups that form the second ring and can be formed from different ring carbon atoms on the furanose ring. Bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides wherein the bridge links the 4' and the 2'-carbons and has the formula 4'- (CH\n2\n)\nn\n-O-2' wherein n is 1 or 2 are suitable. The synthesis of bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides is disclosed in US patents 6,268,490, 6,794,499 and published U.S. application 20020147332.\n\n\nThe synthesis and preparation of the bicyclic sugar modified nucleosides wherein the bridge is 4'-CH\n2\n-O-2' having nucleobases selected from adenine, cytosine, guanine, 5-methyl- cytosine, thymine and uracil, along with their oligomerization, and nucleic acid recognition properties have been described (Koshkin et al., Tetrahedron, 1998, 54, 3607-3630 and WO 98/39352 and WO 99/14226). The L isomer of this bicyclic sugar modified nucleoside has also been prepared (Frieden et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2003, 21, 6365-6372). The 4'-CH\n2\n-S-2' analog has also been prepared (Kumar et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1998, 8, 2219-2222), and 2'-amino-LNA (Singh et al., J. Org. Chem., 1998, 63, 10035-10039).\n\n\nOligomeric compounds of the present invention can also include one or more terminal phosphate moieties.

Further methods of synthesizing the compounds of the formulae herein will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, the various synthetic steps may be performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the desired compounds. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing the compounds described herein are known in the art and include, for example, those such as described in R. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers (1989); T. W. Greene and P. G. M. \n\n Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2d. Ed., John Wiley and Sons (1991); L. Fieser and M. Fieser, Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1994); and L. Paquette, ed., Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1995), and subsequent editions thereof. The compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-, or as (D)- or (L)- for amino acids. The present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. Optical isomers may be prepared from their respective optically active precursors by the procedures described above, or by resolving the racemic mixtures. The resolution can be carried out in the presence of a resolving agent, by chromatography or by repeated crystallization or by some combination of these techniques which are known to those skilled in the art. Further details regarding resolutions can be found in Jacques, et al., Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions (John Wiley & Sons, 1981). When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, other unsaturation, or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers or cis- and trans-isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included. The configuration of any carbon-carbon double bond appearing herein is selected for convenience only and is not intended to designate a particular configuration unless the text so states; thus a carbon-carbon double bond or carbon-heteroatom double bond depicted arbitrarily herein as trans may be cis, trans, or a mixture of the two in any proportion.\n\n\nThe term \"nucleoside,\" as used herein, refers to a base-sugar combination. The base portion of the nucleoside is normally a heterocyclic base moiety. The two most common classes of such heterocyclic bases are purines and pyrimidines. Nucleotides are nucleosides that further include a phosphate group covalently linked to the sugar portion of the nucleoside. For those nucleosides that include a pentofuranosyl sugar, the phosphate group can be linked to either the 2', 3 ' or 5' hydroxyl moiety of the sugar. The term nucleoside is intended to include both modified and unmodified nucleosides. Within the oligonucleotide structure, the phosphate groups are commonly referred to as forming the backbone of the oligomeric compound. In forming oligonucleotides, the phosphate groups covalently link adjacent nucleosides to one another to form a linear polymeric compound. The normal internucleoside linkage of RNA and DNA is a 3' to 5' phosphodiester linkage. \n\n In the context of this invention, the term \"oligonucleoside\" refers to a sequence of nucleosides that are joined by internucleoside linkages that do not have phosphorus atoms. Internucleoside linkages of this type are further described in the \"modified internucleoside linkage\" section below. The term \"oligonucleotide,\" as used herein, refers to an oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) composed of naturally occurring nucleobases, sugars and phosphodiester internucleoside linkages.\n\n\nThe terms \"oligomer\" and \"oligomeric compound,\" as used herein, refer to a plurality of naturally occurring and/or non-naturally occurring nucleosides, joined together with internucleoside linking groups in a specific sequence. At least some of the oligomeric compounds can be capable of hybridizing a region of a target nucleic acid. Included in the terms \"oligomer\" and \"oligomeric compound\" are oligonucleotides, oligonucleotide analogs, oligonucleotide mimetics, oligonucleosides and chimeric combinations of these. As such the term oligomeric compound is broader than the term \"oligonucleotide,\" including all oligomers having all manner of modifications including but not limited to those known in the art. Oligomeric compounds are typically structurally distinguishable from, yet functionally interchangeable with, naturally-occurring or synthetic wild-type oligonucleotides. Thus, oligomeric compounds include all such structures that function effectively to mimic the structure and/or function of a desired RNA or DNA strand, for example, by hybridizing to a target. Such non-naturally occurring oligonucleotides are often desired over the naturally occurring forms because they often have enhanced properties, such as for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for nucleic acid target and increased stability in the presence of nucleases.\n\n\nOligomeric compounds can include compositions comprising double-stranded constructs such as, for example, two oligomeric compounds forming a double stranded hybridized construct or a single strand with sufficient self complementarity to allow for hybridization and formation of a fully or partially double-stranded compound. In one embodiment of the invention, double-stranded oligomeric compounds encompass short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). As used herein, the term \"siRNA\" is defined as a double-stranded construct comprising a first and second strand and having a central complementary portion between the first and second strands and terminal portions that are optionally complementary between the first and second strands or with a target nucleic acid. Each strand in the complex may have a length or from about 12 to about 24 nucleosides and may further comprise a central complementary portion having one of these defined lengths. Each strand may further comprise a \n\n terminal unhybridized portion having from 1 to about 6 nucleobases in length. The siRNAs may also have no terminal portions (overhangs) which is referred to as being blunt ended. The two strands of an siRNA can be linked internally leaving free 3' or 5' termini or can be linked to form a continuous hairpin structure or loop. The hairpin structure may contain an overhang on either the 5' or 3' terminus producing an extension of single-stranded character.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, compositions comprising double-stranded constructs are canonical siRNAs. As used herein, the term \"canonical siRNA\" is defined as a double-stranded oligomeric compound having a first strand and a second strand each strand being 21 nucleobases in length with the strands being complementary over 19 nucleobases and having on each 3' termini of each strand a deoxy thymidine dimer (dTdT) which in the double- stranded compound acts as a 3' overhang. In another aspect compositions comprise double- stranded constructs having overhangs may be of varying lengths with overhangs of varying lengths and may include compositions wherein only one strand has an overhang.\n\n\nFurther modifications can be made to the double-stranded compositions including modification of selected nucleobase positions (e.g. 5-methyl cytosine), sugar positions or to one of the internucleoside linkages. Alternatively, the two strands can be linked via a non-nucleic acid moiety or linker group. When formed from only one strand, dsRNA can take the form of a self-complementary hairpin-type molecule that doubles back on itself to form a duplex. Thus, the dsRNAs can be fully or partially double-stranded. When formed from two strands, or a single strand that takes the form of a self-complementary hairpin-type molecule doubled back on itself to form a duplex, the two strands (or duplex-forming regions of a single strand) are complementary RNA strands that base pair in Watson-Crick fashion.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the oligomeric compounds of the invention are 19 to 30 nucleobases in length, or up to 30 nucleobases in length.

The term \"heterocyclic base moiety\" includes unmodified nucleobases such as the native purine bases adenine (A) and guanine (G), and the pyrimidine bases thymine (T), cytosine (C) and uracil (U). The term is also intended to include all manner of modified or substitute nucleobases including but not limited to synthetic and natural nucleobases such as xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2-aminopyridine and 2- pyridone, 5-methylcytosine (5-me-C), 5-hydroxymethylenyl cytosine, 2-amino and 2- fiuoroadenine, 2-propyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 2-thio cytosine, uracil, thymine, 3-deaza guanine and adenine, 4-thiouracil, 5-uracil (pseudouracil), 5-propynyl (- C≡C-CH\n3\n) uracil and cytosine and other alkynyl derivatives of pyrimidine bases, 5 -halo particularly 5-bromo, 5-trifluoromethyl and other 5-substituted uracils and cytosines, 6-methyl and other alkyl derivatives of adenine and guanine, 6-azo uracil, cytosine and thymine, 7-methyl adenine and guanine, 7-deaza adenine and guanine, 8-halo, 8-amino, 8-aza, 8-thio, 8-thioalkyl, 8- hydroxyl and other 8-substituted adenines and guanines, universal bases, hydrophobic bases, promiscuous bases, size-expanded bases, and fluorinated bases as defined herein.

The universal base need not contribute to hybridization, but should not significantly detract from hybridization and typically refers to a monomer in a first sequence that can pair with a naturally occuring base, i.e A, C, G, T or U at a corresponding position in a second sequence of a duplex in which one or more of the following is true: (1) there is essentially no pairing (hybridization) between the two; or (2) the pairing between them occurs non- discriminant with the universal base hybridizing one or more of the the naturally occurring bases and without significant destabilization of the duplex. Exemplary universal bases include, without limitation, inosine, 5-nitroindole and 4-nitrobenzimidazole. For further examples and descriptions of universal bases see Survey and summary: the applications of universal DNA base analogs. Loakes, Nucleic Acids Research, 2001, 29, 12, 2437-2447.\n\n\nThe term \"promiscuous base\" as used herein, refers to a monomer in a first sequence that can pair with a naturally occuring base, i.e A, C, G, T or U at a corresponding position in a second sequence of a duplex in which the promiscuous base can pair non-discriminantly with more than one of the naturally occurring bases, i.e. A, C, G, T, U.

When incorporated into oligonucleotides these base modifications hybridized with complementary guanine (the latter also hybridized with adenine) and enhanced helical thermal stability by extended stacking interactions (see U.S. Serial Number 10/013,295).\n\n\nOligomeric compounds of the invention may also contain one or more substituted sugar moieties such as the 2'-modifϊed sugars discussed. A more comprehensive but not limiting list of sugar substituent groups includes: OH; F; O-, S-, or N-alkyl; O-, S-, or N-alkenyl; O-, S- or N- alkynyl; or O-alkyl-0-alkyl, wherein the alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl may be substituted or unsubstituted C\n1\n to C\n10\n alkyl or C\n2\n to C\n10\n alkenyl and alkynyl.

One modification includes 2'-dimethylaminooxyethoxy, i.e., a O(CH\n2\n)\n2\nON(CH\n3\n)\n2\n group, also known as 2'-DMAOE, as described in examples hereinbelow, and 2'-dimethylaminoethoxyethoxy (also known in the art as 2'-O-dimethyl-amino-ethoxy-ethyl or 2'-DMAEOE), i.e., 2'-O-CH\n2\n-O-CH\n2\n-N(CH\n3\n)\n2\n.\n\n\nOther sugar substituent groups include methoxy (-0-CH\n3\n), aminopropoxy (-OCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nNH\n2\n), allyl (-CH\n2\n-CH=CH\n2\n), -O-allyl (-0-CH\n2\n-CH=CH\n2\n) and fluoro (F). 2'- Sugar substituent groups may be in the arabino (up) position or ribo (down) position. One 2'- \n\n arabino modification is 2'-F. Similar modifications may also be made at other positions on the oligomeric compound, particularly the 3' position of the sugar on the 3' terminal nucleoside or in 2 '-5' linked oligonucleotides and the 5' position of 5' terminal nucleotide. Oligomeric compounds may also have sugar mimetics such as cyclobutyl moieties in place of the pentofuranosyl sugar.

Representative dimethylaminoethyloxyethyl substituent groups are disclosed in\n\n\nInternational Patent Application PCT/US99/17895, entitled \"2'-O-Dimethylaminoethyloxyethyl- Oligomeric compounds\", filed August 6, 1999.\n\n\nThe terms \"modified internucleoside linkage\" and \"modified backbone,\" or simply \"modified linkage\" as used herein, refer to modifications or replacement of the naturally occurring phosphodiester internucleoside linkage connecting two adjacent nucleosides within an oligomeric compound. Such modified linkages include those that have a phosphorus atom and those that do not have a phosphorus atom.\n\n\nInternucleoside linkages containing a phosphorus atom therein include, for example, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3'-alkylene phosphonates, 5'-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3 '-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, selenophosphates and boranophosphates having normal 3 '-5' linkages, 2'-5' linked analogs of these, and those having inverted polarity wherein one or more internucleotide linkages is a 3' to 3', 5' to 5' or 2' to 2' linkage. Oligonucleotides having inverted polarity can comprise a single 3' to 3' linkage at the 3'-most internucleotide linkage i.e. a single inverted nucleoside residue which may be abasic (the nucleobase is missing or has a hydroxyl group in place thereof). Various salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also included. Representative U.S. patents that teach the preparation of the above phosphorus-containing linkages include, but are not limited to, U.S.: 3,687,808; 4,469,863; 4,476,301; 5,023,243; 5,177,196; 5,188,897; 5,264,423; 5,276,019; 5,278,302; 5,286,717; 5,321,131; 5,399,676; 5,405,939; 5,453,496; 5,455,233; 5,466,677; \n\n 5,476,925; 5,519,126; 5,536,821 ; 5,541,306; 5,550,111 ; 5,563,253; 5,571,799; 5,587,361 ; 5,194,599; 5,565,555; 5,527,899; 5,721,218; 5,672,697 and 5,625,050.\n\n\nIn the C. elegans system, modification of the internucleotide linkage (phosphorothioate in place of phosphodiester) did not significantly interfere with RNAi activity, indicating that oligomeric compounds of the invention can have one or more modified internucleoside linkages, and retain activity. Indeed, such modified internucleoside linkages are often desired over the naturally occurring phosphodiester linkage because of advantageous properties they can impart such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for nucleic acid target and increased stability in the presence of nucleases. Another phosphorus containing modified internucleoside linkage is the phosphono- monoester (see U.S. Patents 5,874,553 and 6,127,346). Phosphonomonoester nucleic acids have useful physical, biological and pharmacological properties in the areas of inhibiting gene expression (antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, sense oligonucleotides and triplex-forming oligonucleotides), as probes for the detection of nucleic acids and as auxiliaries for use in molecular biology.\n\n\nAs previously defined an oligonucleoside refers to a sequence of nucleosides that are joined by internucleoside linkages that do not have phosphorus atoms. Non-phosphorus containing internucleoside linkages include short chain alkyl, cycloalkyl, mixed heteroatom alkyl, mixed heteroatom cycloalkyl, one or more short chain heteroatomic and one or more short chain heterocyclic. These internucleoside linkages include but are not limited to siloxane, sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone, acetyl, formacetyl, thioformacetyl, methylene formacetyl, thioformacetyl, alkeneyl, sulfamate; methyleneimino, methylenehydrazino, sulfonate, sulfonamide, amide and others having mixed N, O, S and CH\n2\n component parts. Representative U.S. patents that teach the preparation of the above oligonucleosides include, but are not limited to, U.S.: 5,034,506; 5,166,315; 5,185,444; 5,214,134; 5,216,141 ; 5,235,033; 5,264,562; 5,264,564; 5,405,938; 5,434,257; 5,466,677; 5,470,967; 5,489,677; 5,541,307; 5,561,225; 5,596,086; 5,602,240; 5,610,289; 5,602,240; 5,608,046; 5,610,289; 5,618,704; 5,623,070; 5,663,312; 5,633,360; 5,677,437; 5,792,608; 5,646,269 and 5,677,439.\n\n\nSome additional examples of modified internucleoside linkages that do not contain a phosphorus atom therein include, -CH\n2\n-NH-O-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-N(CH\n3\n)-O-CH\n2\n- (known as a methylene (methylimino) or MMI backbone), -CH\n2\n-O-N(CH\n3\n)-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-N(CH\n3\n)-N(CH\n3\n)- CH\n2\n- and -O-N(CH\n3\n)-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n- (wherein the native phosphodiester internucleotide linkage is \n\n represented as -O-P(=O)(OH)-O-CH\n2\n-). The MMI type and amide internucleoside linkages are disclosed in the below referenced U.S. patents 5,489,677 and 5,602,240, respectively.\n\n\nAnother modification that can enhance the properties of an oligomeric compound or can be used to track the oligomeric compound or its metabolites is the attachment of one or more moieties or conjugates. Properties that are typically enhanced include without limitation activity, cellular distribution and cellular uptake. In one embodiment, such modified oligomeric compounds are prepared by covalently attaching conjugate groups to functional groups available on an oligomeric compound such as hydroxyl or amino functional groups. Conjugate groups of the invention include intercalators, reporter molecules, polyamines, polyamides, polyethylene glycols, polyethers, groups that enhance the pharmacodynamic properties of oligomers, and groups that enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of oligomers. Typical conjugate groups include cholesterols, lipids, phospholipids, biotin, phenazine, folate, phenanthridine, anthraquinone, acridine, fluoresceins, rhodamines, coumarins, and dyes. Groups that enhance the pharmacodynamic properties, in the context of this invention, include groups that improve properties including but not limited to oligomer uptake, enhance oligomer resistance to degradation, and/or strengthen sequence-specific hybridization with RNA. Groups that enhance the pharmacokinetic properties, in the context of this invention, include groups that improve properties including but not limited to oligomer uptake, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Representative conjugate groups are disclosed in International Patent Application PCT/US92/09196.\n\n\nConjugate groups include but are not limited to lipid moieties such as a cholesterol moiety (Letsinger et al., Proc.

Linking groups are useful for attachment of chemical functional groups, conjugate groups, reporter groups and other groups to selective sites in a parent compound such as for example an oligomeric compound. Linking moieties are also useful for covalently binding one or more groups to a support medium for oliogmer synthesis.\n\n\nGenerelly the linking moieties used for oligomer sythesis covalently bind the ultimate 3'- nucleoside (and thus the nascent oligonucleotide) to the solid support medium (or other medium) during synthesis, but which is cleaved under conditions orthogonal to the conditions under which the 5 '-protecting group, and if applicable any 2 '-protecting group, are removed.\n\n\nIn general a bifunctional linking moiety comprises a hydrocarbyl moiety having two functional groups. One of the functional groups is selected to bind to a parent molecule or compound of interest and the other is selected to bind essentially any selected group such as a chemical functional group or a conjugate group. In some embodiments, the linker comprises a chain structure or an oligomer of repeating units such as ethylene glyol or amino acid units. In other embodiments, the linker comprises a chain structure or an oligomer of repeating units such \n\n as ethylene glyol or amino acid units in combination with a alicyclic or heterocyclic ring system. Examples of functional groups that are routinely used in bifunctional linking moieties include, but are not limited to, electrophiles for reacting with nucleophilic groups and nucleophiles for reacting with electrophilic groups. In some embodiments, bifunctional linking moieties include amino, hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, thiol, unsaturations (e.g., double or triple bonds), and the like, alone or in combination with a heterocyclcic ring system.\n\n\nFurther linking moieties include, but are not limited to, C\n1\n-C\n1\n2 alkylene (e.g. methylene, ethylene (e.g. ethyl- 1,2-ene), propylene (e.g. propyl- 1,2-ene, propyl- 1, 3 -ene), butylene, (e.g. butyl- 1,4-ene, 2-methylpropyl-1,3-ene), pentylene, hexylene, heptylene, octylene, decylene, dodecylene), etc. Exemplary cycloalkylene groups include C\n3\n-C\n12\n cycloalkylene groups, such as cyclopropylene, cyclobutylene, cyclopentanyl-1,3-ene, cyclohexyl- 1,4-ene, etc. Exemplary arylene linking moietys include, but are not limited to, mono- or bicyclic arylene groups having from 6 to about 14 carbon atoms, e.g. phenyl- 1,2-ene, naphthyl-l,6-ene, napthyl- 2,7-ene, anthracenyl, etc. Exemplary heterocyclyl groups within the scope of the invention include mono- or bicyclic aryl groups having from about 4 to about 12 carbon atoms and about 1 to about 4 hetero atoms, such as N, O and S, where the cyclic moieties may be partially dehydrogenated. Some nonlimiting examples of bifunctional linking moieties include 8-amino- 3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (ADO), succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) and 6-aminohexanoic acid (AHEX or AHA). Other linking groups include, but are not limited to, substituted C\n1\n-C\n1 O\n alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C\n2\n-C\n10\n alkenyl or substituted or unsubstituted C\n2\n-C\n10\n alkynyl, wherein a nonlimiting list of preferred substituent groups includes hydroxyl, amino, alkoxy, carboxy, benzyl, phenyl, nitro, thiol, thioalkoxy, halogen, alkyl, aryl, alkenyl and alkynyl.\n\n\nOligomeric compounds used in the compositions of the present invention can also be modified to have one or more stabilizing groups that are generally attached to one or both termini of oligomeric compounds to enhance properties such as for example nuclease stability. Included in stabilizing groups are cap structures. The terms \"cap structure\" or \"terminal cap moiety,\" as used herein, refer to chemical modifications, which can be attached to one or both of the termini of an oligomeric compound. These terminal modifications protect the oligomeric compounds having terminal nucleic acid moieties from exonuclease degradation, and can help in delivery and/or localization within a cell. The cap can be present at the 5'-terminus (5'-cap) or at the 3'-terminus (3'-cap) or can be present on both termini. In non-limiting examples, the 5'-cap includes inverted abasic residue (moiety), 4',5 '-methylene nucleotide; l-(beta-D- \n\n erythrofuranosyl) nucleotide, 4'-thio nucleotide, carbocyclic nucleotide; 1 ,5-anhydrohexitol nucleotide; L-nucleotides; alpha-nucleotides; modified base nucleotide; phosphorodithioate linkage; threo-pentofuranosyl nucleotide; acyclic 3',4'-seco nucleotide; acyclic 3,4- dihydroxybutyl nucleotide; acyclic 3,5-dihydroxypentyl nucleotide, 3 '-3 '-inverted nucleotide moiety; 3 '-3 '-inverted abasic moiety; 3'-2'-inverted nucleotide moiety; 3'-2'-inverted abasic moiety; 1 ,4-butanediol phosphate; 3'-phosphoramidate; hexylphosphate; aminohexyl phosphate; 3'-phosphate; 3'-phosphorothioate; phosphorodithioate; or bridging or non-bridging methylphosphonate moiety (for more details see Wincott et al., International PCT publication No. WO 97/26270). Particularly suitable 3'-cap structures of the present invention include, for example 4',5'- methylene nucleotide; 1 -(beta-D-erythrofuranosyl) nucleotide; 4'-thio nucleotide, carbocyclic nucleotide; 5'-amino-alkyl phosphate; 1,3-diamino-2-propyl phosphate, 3-aminopropyl phosphate; 6-aminohexyl phosphate; 1 ,2-aminododecyl phosphate; hydroxypropyl phosphate; 1,5-anhydrohexitol nucleotide; L-nucleotide; alpha-nucleotide; modified base nucleotide; phosphorodithioate; threo-pentofuranosyl nucleotide; acyclic 3',4'-seco nucleotide; 3,4- dihydroxybutyl nucleotide; 3,5-dihydroxypentyl nucleotide, 5 '-5 '-inverted nucleotide moiety; 5'- 5'-inverted abasic moiety; 5'-phosphoramidate; 5'-phosphorothioate; 1 ,4-butanediol phosphate; 5'-amino; bridging and/or non-bridging 5'-phosphoramidate, phosphorothioate and/or phosphorodithioate, bridging or non bridging methylphosphonate and 5'-mercapto moieties (for more details see Beaucage and Tyer, 1993, Tetrahedron 49, 1925 and Published U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2005/0020525 published on January 27, 2005). Further 3' and 5 '-stabilizing groups that can be used to cap one or both ends of an oligomeric compound to impart nuclease stability include those disclosed in WO 03/004602.\n\n\nOligomerization of modified and unmodified nucleosides is performed according to literature procedures for DNA (Protocols for Oligonucleotides and Analogs, Ed. Agrawal (1993), Humana Press) and/or RNA (Scaringe, Methods (2001), 23, 206-217. Gait et al., Applications of Chemically synthesized RNA in RNA:Protein Interactions, Ed. Smith (1998), 1-36. Gallo et al., Tetrahedron (2001), 57, 5707-5713) synthesis as appropriate. In addition specific protocols for the synthesis of oligomeric compounds of the invention are illustrated in the examples below. Support bound oligonucleotide synthesis relies on sequential addition of nucleotides to one end of a growing chain. Typically, a first nucleoside (having protecting groups on any exocyclic amine functionalities present) is attached to an appropriate glass bead support and nucleotides bearing the appropriate activated phosphite moiety, i.e. an \"activated phosphorous \n\n group\" (typically nucleotide phosphoramidites, also bearing appropriate protecting groups) are added stepwise to elongate the growing oligonucleotide. Additional methods for solid-phase synthesis may be found in Caruthers U.S. Patents Nos. 4,415,732; 4,458,066; 4,500,707; 4,668,777; 4,973,679; and 5,132,418; and Koster U.S. Patents Nos. 4,725,677 and Re. 34,069. Oligonucleotides are generally prepared either in solution or on a support medium, e.g. a solid support medium. In general a first synthon (e.g. a monomer, such as a nucleoside) is first attached to a support medium, and the oligonucleotide is then synthesized by sequentially coupling monomers to the support-bound synthon. This iterative elongation eventually results in a final oligomeric compound or other polymer such as a polypeptide. Suitable support medium can be soluble or insoluble, or may possess variable solubility in different solvents to allow the growing support bound polymer to be either in or out of solution as desired. Traditional support medium such as solid support media are for the most part insoluble and are routinely placed in reaction vessels while reagents and solvents react with and/or wash the growing chain until the oligomer has reached the target length, after which it is cleaved from the support and, if necessary further worked up to produce the final polymeric compound. More recent approaches have introduced soluble supports including soluble polymer supports to allow precipitating and dissolving the iteratively synthesized product at desired points in the synthesis (Gravert et al., Chem. Rev., 1997, 97, 489-510).\n\n\nThe term support medium is intended to include all forms of support known to one of ordinary skill in the art for the synthesis of oligomeric compounds and related compounds such as peptides. Some representative support medium that are amenable to the methods of the present invention include but are not limited to the following: controlled pore glass (CPG); oxalyl-controlled pore glass (see, e.g., Alul, et al., Nucleic Acids Research 1991, 19, 1527); silica-containing particles, such as porous glass beads and silica gel such as that formed by the reaction of trichloro-[3-(4-chloromethyl)phenyl]propylsilane and porous glass beads (see Parr and Grohmann, Angew. Chem. Internal. Ed. 1972, 11, 314, sold under the trademark \"PORASIL E\" by Waters Associates, Framingham, Mass., USA); the mono ester of 1 ,4-dihydroxymethyl- enlybenzene and silica (see Bayer and Jung, Tetrahedron Lett., 1970, 4503, sold under the trademark \"BIOPAK\" by Waters Associates); TENTAGEL (see, e.g., Wright, et al., Tetrahedron Letters 1993, 34, 3373); cross-linked styrene/divinylbenzene copolymer beaded matrix or POROS, a copolymer of polystyrene/divinylbenzene (available from Perceptive Biosystems); soluble support medium, polyethylene glycol PEGs (see Bonora et al., Organic Process Research & Development, 2000, 4, 225-231). \n\n Certain heteroaryl groups that may be mentioned as being within the scope of the invention include: pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl (e.g. 2,5-piperidinyl, 3,5-piperidinyl), piperazinyl, tetrahydrothiophenyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydro quinolinyl, tetrahydro isoquinolinyl, tetrahydroquinazolinyl, tetrahydroquinoxalinyl, etc. Exemplary heteroarylene groups include mono- or bicyclic aryl groups having from about 4 to about 12 carbon atoms and about 1 to about 4 hetero atoms, such as N, O and S. Certain heteroaryl groups that may be mentioned as being within the scope of the invention include: pyridylene (e.g. pyridyl-2,5-ene, pyridyl-3,5- ene), pyrimidinyl, thiophenyl, furanyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, etc. Commercially available equipment routinely used for the support medium based synthesis of oligomeric compounds and related compounds is sold by several vendors including, for example, Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally or alternatively be employed. Suitable solid phase techniques, including automated synthesis techniques, are described in F. Eckstein (ed.), Oligonucleotides and Analogues, a Practical Approach, Oxford University Press, New York (1991). Although a lot of research has focused on the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides the main RNA synthesis strategies that are presently being used commercially include 5'-O-DMT-2\nr\n- O-t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), 5'-O-DMT-2'-O-[l (2-fluorophenyl)-4-methoxypiperidin-4-yl] (FPMP), 2'-O-[(triisopropylsilyl)oxy]methyl (2'-O-CH\n2\n-O-Si(iPr)\n3\n (TOM), and the 5'-0-silyl ether-2'-ACE (5'-O-bis(trimethylsiloxy)cyclododecyloxysilyl ether (DOD)-2'-O-bis(2- acetoxyethoxy)methyl (ACE). A current list of some of the major companies currently offering RNA products include Pierce Nucleic Acid Technologies, Dharmacon Research Inc., Ameri Biotechnologies Inc., and Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. One company, Princeton Separations, is marketing an RNA synthesis activator advertised to reduce coupling times especially with TOM and TBDMS chemistries. Such an activator would also be amenable to the present invention. The primary groups being used for commercial RNA synthesis are: TBDMS = 5'-O-DMT-2'-O-t-butyldimethylsilyl; TOM = 2'-O-[(triisopropylsilyl)oxy]methyl;\n\n\nDOD/ACE = 5'-O-bis(trimethylsiloxy)cyclododecyloxysilylether- 2'-O-bis(2-acetoxyethoxy)methyl; FPMP = 5'-O-DMT-2'-O-[l(2-fluorophenyl)-4-methoxypiperidin-4-yl].\n\n\nAll of the aforementioned RNA synthesis strategies are amenable to the present invention. Strategies that would be a hybrid of the above e.g. using a 5 '-protecting group from \n\n one strategy with a 2'-O-protecting from another strategy is also amenable to the present invention.\n\n\nThe terms \"antisense\" or \"antisense inhibition\" as used herein refer to the hybridization of an oligomeric compound or a portion thereof with a selected target nucleic acid. Multiple antisense mechanisms exist by which oligomeric compounds can be used to modulate gene expression in mammalian cells. Such antisense inhibition is typically based upon hydrogen bonding-based hybridization of complementary strands or segments such that at least one strand or segment is cleaved, degraded, or otherwise rendered inoperable. In this regard, it is presently suitable to target specific nucleic acid molecules and their functions for such antisense inhibition. The functions of DNA to be interfered with can include replication and transcription.\n\n\nReplication and transcription, for example, can be from an endogenous cellular template, a vector, a plasmid construct or otherwise. The functions of RNA to be interfered with can include functions such as translocation of the RNA to a site of protein translation, translocation of the RNA to sites within the cell which are distant from the site of RNA synthesis, translation of protein from the RNA, splicing of the RNA to yield one or more RNA species, and catalytic activity or complex formation involving the RNA which may be engaged in or facilitated by the RNA.\n\n\nA commonly exploited antisense mechanism is RNase H-dependent degradation of a targeted RNA. RNase H is a ubiquitously expressed endonuclease that recognizes antisense DNA-RNA heteroduplexes, hydrolyzing the RNA strand. A further antisense mechanism involves the utilization of enzymes that catalyze the cleavage of RNA-RNA duplexes. These reactions are catalyzed by a class of RNAse enzymes including but not limited to RNAse III and RNAse L. The antisense mechanism known as RNA interference (RNAi) is operative on RNA- RNA hybrids and the like. Both RNase H-based antisense (usually using single-stranded compounds) and RNA interference (usually using double-stranded compounds known as siRNAs) are antisense mechanisms, typically resulting in loss of target RNA function.\n\n\nOptimized siRNA and RNase H-dependent oligomeric compounds behave similarly in terms of potency, maximal effects, specificity and duration of action, and efficiency. Moreover it has been shown that in general, activity of dsRNA constructs correlated with the activity of RNase H-dependent single-stranded antisense oligomeric compounds targeted to the same site. One major exception is that RNase H-dependent antisense oligomeric compounds were generally active against target sites in pre-mRNA whereas siRNAs were not. \n\n These data suggest that, in general, sites on the target RNA that were not active with RNase H-dependent oligonucleotides were similarly not good sites for siRNA. Conversely, a significant degree of correlation between active RNase H oligomeric compounds and siRNA was found, suggesting that if a site is available for hybridization to an RNase H oligomeric compound, then it is also available for hybridization and cleavage by the siRNA complex. Consequetly, once suitable target sites have been determined by either antisense approach, these sites can be used to design constructs that operate by the alternative antisense mechanism (Vickers et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2003, 278, 7108). Moreover, once a site has been demonstrated as active for either an RNAi or an RNAse H oligomeric compound, a single-stranded RNAi oligomeric compound (ssRNAi or asRNA) can be designed.\n\n\nThe oligomeric compounds and methods of the present invention are also useful in the study, characterization, validation and modulation of small non-coding RNAs. These include, but are not limited to, microRNAs (miRNA), small nuclear RNAs (snRNA), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA), small temporal RNAs (stRNA) and tiny non-coding RNAs (tncRNA) or their precursors or processed transcripts or their association with other cellular components.\n\n\nSmall non-coding RNAs have been shown to function in various developmental and regulatory pathways in a wide range of organisms, including plants, nematodes and mammals. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that are processed from larger precursors by enzymatic cleavage and inhibit translation of mRNAs. stRNAs, while processed from precursors much like miRNAs, have been shown to be involved in developmental timing regulation. Other non- coding small RNAs are involved in events as diverse as cellular splicing of transcripts, translation, transport, and chromosome organization.\n\n\nAs modulators of small non-coding RNA function, the oligomeric compounds of the present invention find utility in the control and manipulation of cellular functions or processes such as regulation of splicing, chromosome packaging or methylation, control of developmental timing events, increase or decrease of target RNA expression levels depending on the timing of delivery into the specific biological pathway and translational or transcriptional control. In addition, the oligomeric compounds of the present invention can be modified in order to optimize their effects in certain cellular compartments, such as the cytoplasm, nucleus, nucleolus or mitochondria.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention can further be used to identify components of regulatory pathways of RNA processing or metabolism as well as in screening assays or devices. \n\n Targeting an oligomeric compound to a particular nucleic acid molecule, in the context of this invention, can be a multistep process. The process usually begins with the identification of a target nucleic acid whose function is to be modulated. The terms \"target nucleic acid\" and \"nucleic acid target\", as used herein, refer to any nucleic acid capable of being targeted including without limitation DNA (a cellular gene), RNA (including pre-mRNA and mRNA or portions thereof) transcribed from such DNA, and also cDNA derived from such RNA. In one embodiment the modulation of expression of a selected gene is associated with a particular disorder or disease state. In another embodiment the target nucleic acid is a nucleic acid molecule from an infectious agent. The targeting process usually also includes determination of at least one target region, segment, or site within the target nucleic acid for the antisense interaction to occur such that the desired effect, e.g., modulation of expression, will result. Within the context of the present invention as it is applied to a nucleic acid target, the term \"region\" is defined as a portion of the target nucleic acid having at least one identifiable structure, function, or characteristic. Within regions of target nucleic acids are segments. \"Segments\" are defined as smaller or sub-portions of regions within a target nucleic acid. \"Sites,\" as used in the present invention, are defined as positions within a target nucleic acid. The terms region, segment, and site can also be used to describe an oligomeric compound of the invention such as for example a gapped oligomeric compound having 3 separate regions or segments. Since, as is known in the art, the translation initiation codon is typically 5'-AUG (in transcribed mRNA molecules; 5'-ATG in the corresponding DNA molecule), the translation initiation codon is also referred to as the \"AUG codon,\" the \"start codon\" or the \"AUG start codon\". A minority of genes have a translation initiation codon having the RNA sequence 5'-GUG, 5'-UUG or 5'-CUG, and 5'-AUA, 5'-ACG and 5'-CUG have been shown to function in vivo. Thus, the terms \"translation initiation codon\" and \"start codon\" can encompass many codon sequences, even though the initiator amino acid in each instance is typically methionine (in eukaryotes) or formylmethionine (in prokaryotes). It is also known in the art that eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes may have two or more alternative start codons, any one of which may be preferentially utilized for translation initiation in a particular cell type or tissue, or under a particular set of conditions. In the context of the invention, \"start codon\" and \"translation initiation codon\" refer to the codon or codons that are used in vivo to initiate translation of an mRNA transcribed from a gene encoding a nucleic acid target, regardless of the sequence(s) of such codons. It is also known in the art that a translation termination codon (or \"stop codon\") of \n\n a gene may have one of three sequences, i.e., 5'-UAA, 5'-UAG and 5'-UGA (the corresponding DNA sequences are 5'-TAA, 5'-TAG and 5'-TGA, respectively).\n\n\nThe terms \"start codon region\" and \"translation initiation codon region\" refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5' or 3') from a translation initiation codon. Similarly, the terms \"stop codon region\" and \"translation termination codon region\" refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5' or 3') from a translation termination codon. Consequently, the \"start codon region\" (or \"translation initiation codon region\") and the \"stop codon region\" (or \"translation termination codon region\") are all regions which may be targeted effectively with the antisense oligomeric compounds of the present invention.\n\n\nThe open reading frame (ORF) or \"coding region,\" which is known in the art to refer to the region between the translation initiation codon and the translation termination codon, is also a region which may be targeted effectively. Within the context of the present invention, one region is the intragenic region encompassing the translation initiation or termination codon of the open reading frame (ORF) of a gene.\n\n\nOther target regions include the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 5' direction from the translation initiation codon, and thus including nucleotides between the 5' cap site and the translation initiation codon of an mRNA (or corresponding nucleotides on the gene), and the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 3' direction from the translation termination codon, and thus including nucleotides between the translation termination codon and 3' end of an mRNA (or corresponding nucleotides on the gene). The 5' cap site of an mRNA comprises an NT- methylated guanosine residue joined to the 5'-most residue of the mRNA via a 5'-5' triphosphate linkage. The 5' cap region of an mRNA is considered to include the 5' cap structure itself as well as the first 50 nucleotides adjacent to the cap site. It is also suitable to target the 5' cap region.\n\n\nAlthough some eukaryotic mRNA transcripts are directly translated, many contain one or more regions, known as \"introns,\" which are excised from a transcript before it is translated. The remaining (and therefore translated) regions are known as \"exons\" and are spliced together to form a continuous mRNA sequence. Targeting splice sites, i.e., intron-exon junctions or exon-intron junctions, may also be particularly useful in situations where aberrant splicing is implicated in disease, or where an overproduction of a particular splice product is implicated in disease. Aberrant fusion junctions due to rearrangements or deletions are also suitable target \n\n sites. mRNA transcripts produced via the process of splicing of two (or more) mRNAs from different gene sources are known as \"fusion transcripts\". It is also known that introns can be effectively targeted using antisense oligomeric compounds targeted to, for example, DNA or pre- mRNA. It is also known in the art that alternative RNA transcripts can be produced from the same genomic region of DNA. These alternative transcripts are generally known as \"variants\". More specifically, \"pre-mRNA variants\" are transcripts produced from the same genomic DNA that differ from other transcripts produced from the same genomic DNA in either their start or stop position and contain both intronic and exonic sequences. Upon excision of one or more exon or intron regions, or portions thereof during splicing, pre-mRNA variants produce smaller \"mRNA variants\". Consequently, mRNA variants are processed pre-mRNA variants and each unique pre-mRNA variant must always produce a unique mRNA variant as a result of splicing. These mRNA variants are also known as \"alternative splice variants\". If no splicing of the pre-mRNA variant occurs then the pre-mRNA variant is identical to the mRNA variant.\n\n\nIt is also known in the art that variants can be produced through the use of alternative signals to start or stop transcription and that pre-mRNAs and mRNAs can possess more that one start codon or stop codon. Variants that originate from a pre-mRNA or mRNA that use alternative start codons are known as \"alternative start variants\" of that pre-mRNA or mRNA. Those transcripts that use an alternative stop codon are known as \"alternative stop variants\" of that pre-mRNA or mRNA. One specific type of alternative stop variant is the \"polyA variant\" in which the multiple transcripts produced result from the alternative selection of one of the \"polyA stop signals\" by the transcription machinery, thereby producing transcripts that terminate at unique polyA sites. Within the context of the invention, the types of variants described herein are also suitable target nucleic acids.\n\n\nThe locations on the target nucleic acid to which the antisense oligomeric compounds hybridize are hereinbelow referred to as \"suitable target segments.\" As used herein the term \"suitable target segment\" is defined as at least an 8-nucleobase portion of a target region to which an active antisense oligomeric compound is targeted. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is presently believed that these target segments represent portions of the target nucleic acid which are accessible for hybridization.\n\n\nExemplary antisense oligomeric compounds include oligomeric compounds that comprise at least the 8 consecutive nucleobases from the 5 '-terminus of a targeted nucleic acid \n\n e.g. a cellular gene or mRNA transcribed from the gene (the remaining nucleobases being a consecutive stretch of the same oligonucleotide beginning immediately upstream of the 5'- terminus of the antisense oligomeric compound which is specifically hybridizable to the target nucleic acid and continuing until the oligonucleotide contains from about 8 to about 80 nucleobases). Similarly, antisense oligomeric compounds are represented by oligonucleotide sequences that comprise at least the 8 consecutive nucleobases from the 3 '-terminus of one of the illustrative antisense oligomeric compounds (the remaining nucleobases being a consecutive stretch of the same oligonucleotide beginning immediately downstream of the 3 '-terminus of the antisense oligomeric compound which is specifically hybridizable to the target nucleic acid and continuing until the oligonucleotide contains from about 8 to about 80 nucleobases). One having skill in the art armed with the antisense oligomeric compounds illustrated herein will be able, without undue experimentation, to identify further antisense oligomeric compounds.\n\n\nOnce one or more target regions, segments or sites have been identified, antisense oligomeric compounds are chosen which are sufficiently complementary to the target, i.e., hybridize sufficiently well and with sufficient specificity, to give the desired effect.\n\n\nIn accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a series of nucleic acid duplexes comprising the antisense oligomeric compounds of the present invention and their complements can be designed for a specific target or targets. The ends of the strands may be modified by the addition of one or more natural or modified nucleobases to form an overhang. The sense strand of the duplex is then designed and synthesized as the complement of the antisense strand and may also contain modifications or additions to either terminus. For example, in one embodiment, both strands of the duplex would be complementary over the central nucleobases, each having overhangs at one or both termini.\n\n\nRNA strands of the duplex can be synthesized by methods disclosed herein or purchased from various RNA synthesis companies such as for example Dharmacon Research Inc., (Lafayette, CO). Once synthesized, the complementary strands are annealed. The single strands are aliquoted and diluted to a concentration of 50 μM. Once diluted, 30 μL of each strand is combined with 15 μL of a 5X solution of annealing buffer. The final concentration of the buffer is 100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, and 2mM magnesium acetate. The final volume is 75 μL. This solution is incubated for 1 minute at 90°C and then centrifuged for 15 seconds. The tube is allowed to sit for 1 hour at 37°C at which time the dsRNA duplexes are used in experimentation. The final concentration of the dsRNA compound is 20 μM. This solution can be stored frozen (-20°C) and freeze-thawed up to 5 times. \n\n Once prepared, the desired synthetic duplexs are evaluated for their ability to modulate target expression. When cells reach 80% confluency, they are treated with synthetic duplexs comprising at least one oligomeric compound of the invention. For cells grown in 96-well plates, wells are washed once with 200 μL OPTI-MEM-I reduced-serum medium (Gibco BRL) and then treated with 130 μL of OPTI-MEM-I containing 12 μg/mL LIPOFECTIN (Gibco BRL) and the desired dsRNA compound at a final concentration of 200 nM. After 5 hours of treatment, the medium is replaced with fresh medium. Cells are harvested 16 hours after treatment, at which time RNA is isolated and target reduction measured by RT-PCR.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the \"suitable target segments\" identified herein may be employed in a screen for additional oligomeric compounds that modulate the expression of a target. \"Modulators\" are those oligomeric compounds that decrease or increase the expression of a nucleic acid molecule encoding a target and which comprise at least an 8-nucleobase portion which is complementary to a suitable target segment. The screening method comprises the steps of contacting a suitable target segment of a nucleic acid molecule encoding a target with one or more candidate modulators, and selecting for one or more candidate modulators which decrease or increase the expression of a nucleic acid molecule encoding a target. Once it is shown that the candidate modulator or modulators are capable of modulating (e.g. either decreasing or increasing) the expression of a nucleic acid molecule encoding a target, the modulator may then be employed in further investigative studies of the function of a target, or for use as a research, diagnostic, or therapeutic agent in accordance with the present invention.\n\n\nThe suitable target segments of the present invention may also be combined with their respective complementary antisense oligomeric compounds of the present invention to form stabilized double stranded (duplexed) oligonucleotides.\n\n\nIn the context of this invention, \"hybridization\" means hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between the heterocyclic base moieties of complementary nucleosides. For example, adenine and thymine are complementary nucleobases which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. \"Complementary,\" as used herein, refers to the capacity for precise pairing between two nucleotides. For example, if a nucleotide at a certain position of an oligonucleotide is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleotide at the same position of a DNA or RNA molecule, then the oligonucleotide and the DNA or RNA are considered to be complementary to each other at that position. The oligonucleotide and the DNA or RNA are complementary to each other when a sufficient number of corresponding positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleotides \n\n which can hydrogen bond with each other. Thus, \"specifically hybridizable\" and \"complementary\" are terms which are used to indicate a sufficient degree of complementarity or precise pairing such that stable and specific binding occurs between the oligonucleotide and the DNA or RNA target. It is understood in the art that the sequence of an antisense oligomeric compound need not be 100% complementary to that of its target nucleic acid to be specifically hybridizable. An antisense oligomeric compound is specifically hybridizable when binding of the compound to the target DNA or RNA molecule interferes with the normal function of the target DNA or RNA to cause a complete or partial loss of function, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the antisense oligomeric compound to non-target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of therapeutic treatment, or under conditions in which in vitro or in vivo assays are performed. Moreover, an oligonucleotide may hybridize over one or more segments such that intervening or adjacent segments are not involved in the hybridization event (e.g., a loop structure, mismatch or hairpin structure). The oligomeric compounds of the present invention comprise at least 70%, at least\n\n\n75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99%, or 100% sequence complementarity to a target region within the target nucleic acid sequence to which they are targeted. For example, an antisense oligomeric compound in which 18 of 20 nucleobases of the antisense oligomeric compound are complementary to a target region, and would therefore specifically hybridize, would represent 90 percent complementarity. In this example, the remaining noncomplementary nucleobases may be clustered or interspersed with complementary nucleobases and need not be contiguous to each other or to complementary nucleobases. As such, an antisense oligomeric compound which is 18 nucleobases in length having 4 (four) noncomplementary nucleobases which are flanked by two regions of complete complementarity with the target nucleic acid would have 77.8% overall complementarity with the target nucleic acid and would thus fall within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nPercent complementarity of an antisense oligomeric compound with a region of a target nucleic acid can be determined routinely using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search tools) and PowerBLAST programs known in the art (Altschul et al., J. MoI. Biol., 1990, 215, 403-410; Zhang and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649-656). Percent homology, sequence identity or complementarity, can be determined by, for example, the Gap program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, Madison WI), using default settings, which uses the algorithm of Smith and Waterman \n\n (Adv. Appl. Math., 1981, 2, 482-489). In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, between the oligomeric compound and the target is about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 92%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, or 100%. In some embodiments, \"suitable target segments\" may be employed in a screen for additional oligomeric compounds that modulate the expression of a selected protein. \"Modulators\" are those oligomeric compounds that decrease or increase the expression of a nucleic acid molecule encoding a protein and which comprise at least an 8-nucleobase portion which is complementary to a suitable target segment. The screening method comprises the steps of contacting a suitable target segment of a nucleic acid molecule encoding a protein with one or more candidate modulators, and selecting for one or more candidate modulators which decrease or increase the expression of a nucleic acid molecule encoding a protein. Once it is shown that the candidate modulator or modulators are capable of modulating (e.g. either decreasing or increasing) the expression of a nucleic acid molecule encoding a peptide, the modulator may then be employed in further investigative studies of the function of the peptide, or for use as a research, diagnostic, or therapeutic agent in accordance with the present invention.\n\n\nThe suitable target segments of the present invention may also be combined with their respective complementary antisense oligomeric compounds of the present invention to form stabilized double stranded (duplexed) oligonucleotides. Such double stranded oligonucleotide moieties have been shown in the art to modulate target expression and regulate translation as well as RNA processsing via an antisense mechanism. Moreover, the double stranded moieties may be subject to chemical modifications (Fire et al., Nature, 1998, 391, 806-811 ; Timmons and Fire, Nature 1998, 395, 854; Timmons et al., Gene, 2001, 263, 103-112; Tabara et al., Science, 1998, 282, 430-431 ; Montgomery et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1998, 95, 15502-15507; Tuschl et al., Genes Dev., 1999, 13, 3191-3197; Elbashir et al., Nature, 2001, 411, 494-498; Elbashir et al., Genes Dev. 2001, 15, 188-200). For example, such double stranded moieties have been shown to inhibit the target by the classical hybridization of antisense strand of the duplex to the target, thereby triggering enzymatic degradation of the target (Tijsterman et al., Science, 2002, 295, 694-697). The oligomeric compounds of the present invention can also be applied in the areas of drug discovery and target validation. The present invention comprehends the use of the oligomeric compounds and targets identified herein in drug discovery efforts to elucidate relationships that exist between proteins and a disease state, phenotype, or condition. These methods include detecting or modulating a target peptide comprising contacting a sample, \n\n tissue, cell, or organism with the oligomeric compounds of the present invention, measuring the nucleic acid or protein level of the target and/or a related phenotypic or chemical endpoint at some time after treatment, and optionally comparing the measured value to a non-treated sample or sample treated with a further oligomeric compound of the invention. These methods can also be performed in parallel or in combination with other experiments to determine the function of unknown genes for the process of target validation or to determine the validity of a particular gene product as a target for treatment or prevention of a particular disease, condition, or phenotype.\n\n\nEffect of nucleoside modifications on RNAi activity can be evaluated according to existing literature (Elbashir et al., Nature, 2001, 411, 494-498; Nishikura et al., Cell, 2001, 107, 415-416; and Bass et al., Cell, 2000, 101, 235-238.)\n\n\nThe oligomeric compounds of the present invention can be utilized for diagnostics, therapeutics, prophylaxis and as research reagents and kits. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides, which are able to inhibit gene expression with exquisite specificity, are often used by those of ordinary skill to elucidate the function of particular genes or to distinguish between functions of various members of a biological pathway. For use in kits and diagnostics, the oligomeric compounds of the present invention, either alone or in combination with other oligomeric compounds or therapeutics, can be used as tools in differential and/or combinatorial analyses to elucidate expression patterns of a portion or the entire complement of genes expressed within cells and tissues.\n\n\nAs one nonlimiting example, expression patterns within cells or tissues treated with one or more antisense oligomeric compounds are compared to control cells or tissues not treated with antisense oligomeric compounds and the patterns produced are analyzed for differential levels of gene expression as they pertain, for example, to disease association, signaling pathway, cellular localization, expression level, size, structure or function of the genes examined. These analyses can be performed on stimulated or unstimulated cells and in the presence or absence of other compounds and or oligomeric compounds which affect expression patterns.\n\n\nExamples of methods of gene expression analysis known in the art include DNA arrays or microarrays (Brazma and ViIo, FEBS Lett., 2000, 480, 17-24; Celis, et al., FEBS Lett., 2000, 480, 2-16), SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression)(Madden, et al., Drug Discov. Today, 2000, 5, 415-425), READS (restriction enzyme amplification of digested cDNAs) (Prashar and Weissman, Methods Enzymol., 1999, 303, 258-72), TOGA (total gene expression analysis) (Sutcliffe, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 2000, 97, 1976-81), protein arrays and \n\n proteomics (Celis, et al., FEBS Lett., 2000, 480, 2-16; Jungblut, et al., Electrophoresis, 1999, 20, 2100-10), expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing (Celis, et al., FEBS Lett., 2000, 480, 2-16; Larsson, et al., J. Biotechnol., 2000, 80, 143-57), subtractive RNA fingerprinting (SuRF) (Fuchs, et al., Anal. Biochem., 2000, 286, 91-98; Larson, et al., Cytometry, 2000, 41, 203-208), subtractive cloning, differential display (DD) (Jurecic and Belmont, Curr. Opin. Microbiol., 2000, 3, 316-21), comparative genomic hybridization (Carulli, et al., J. Cell Biochem. Suppl., 1998, 31, 286-96), FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) techniques (Going and Gusterson, Eur. J. Cancer, 1999, 35, 1895-904) and mass spectrometry methods (To, Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen, 2000, 3, 235-41). The oligomeric compounds of the invention are useful for research and diagnostics, in one aspect because they hybridize to nucleic acids encoding proteins. For example, oligonucleotides that are shown to hybridize with such efficiency and under such conditions as disclosed herein as to be effective protein inhibitors will also be effective primers or probes under conditions favoring gene amplification or detection, respectively. These primers and probes are useful in methods requiring the specific detection of nucleic acid molecules encoding proteins and in the amplification of the nucleic acid molecules for detection or for use in further studies. Hybridization of the antisense oligonucleotides, particularly the primers and probes, of the invention with a nucleic acid can be detected by means known in the art. Such means may include conjugation of an enzyme to the oligonucleotide, radiolabelling of the oligonucleotide or any other suitable detection means. Kits using such detection means for detecting the level of selected proteins in a sample may also be prepared.\n\n\nThe specificity and sensitivity of antisense is also harnessed by those of skill in the art for therapeutic uses. Antisense oligomeric compounds have been employed as therapeutic moieties in the treatment of disease states in animals, including humans. Antisense oligonucleotide drugs, including ribozymes, have been safely and effectively administered to humans and numerous clinical trials are presently underway. It is thus established that antisense oligomeric compounds can be useful therapeutic modalities that can be configured to be useful in treatment regimes for the treatment of cells, tissues and animals, especially humans.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"patient\" refers to a mammal that is afflicted with one or more disorders associated with expression or overexpression of one or more genes. It will be understood that the most suitable patient is a human. It is also understood that this invention relates specifically to the inhibition of mammalian expression or overexpression of one or more genes. \n\n It is recognized that one skilled in the art may affect the disorders associated with expression or overexpression of a gene by treating a patient presently afflicted with the disorders with an effective amount of one or more oligomeric compounds or compositions of the present invention. Thus, the terms \"treatment\" and \"treating\" are intended to refer to all processes wherein there may be a slowing, interrupting, arresting, controlling, or stopping of the progression of the disorders described herein, but does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all symptoms.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"effective amount\" or \"therapeutically effective amount\" of a compound of the present invention refers to an amount that is effective in treating or preventing the disorders described herein.\n\n\nFor therapeutics, a patient, such as a human, suspected of having a disease or disorder which can be treated by modulating the expression of a gene is treated by administering antisense oligomeric compounds in accordance with this invention. The compounds of the invention can be utilized in pharmaceutical compositions by adding an effective amount of an antisense oligomeric compound to a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. Use of the antisense oligomeric compounds and methods of the invention may also be useful prophylactically, e.g., to prevent or delay infection, inflammation or tumor formation, for example. In some embodiments, the patient being treated has been identified as being in need of treatment or has been previously diagnosed as such. The oligomeric compounds of the invention encompass any pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, or salts of such esters, or any other compound which, upon administration to an animal including a human, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) the biologically active metabolite or residue thereof. Accordingly, for example, the disclosure is also drawn to prodrugs and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such prodrugs, and other bioequivalents. For oligonucleotides, examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts and their uses are further described in U.S. Patent 6,287,860.\n\n\nThe compositions of the invention may also be admixed, encapsulated, conjugated or otherwise associated with other molecules, molecule structures or mixtures of compounds, as for example, liposomes, receptor-targeted molecules, oral, rectal, topical or other formulations, for assisting in uptake, distribution and/or absorption. Representative U.S. patents that teach the preparation of such uptake, distribution and/or absorption-assisting formulations include, but are not limited to, U.S.: 5,108,921; 5,354,844; 5,416,016; 5,459,127; 5,521,291; 5,543,158; \n\n 5,547,932; 5,583,020; 5,591,721 ; 4,426,330; 4,534,899; 5,013,556; 5,108,921 ; 5,213,804; 5,227,170; 5,264,221; 5,356,633; 5,395,619; 5,416,016; 5,417,978; 5,462,854; 5,469,854; 5,512,295; 5,527,528; 5,534,259; 5,543,152; 5,556,948; 5,580,575; and 5,595,756.\n\n\nThe present invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions and formulations which include the compositions of the invention. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in a number of ways depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including vaginal and rectal delivery), pulmonary, e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal and transdermal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. Oligonucleotides with at least one 2'-O-methoxyethyl modification are believed to be particularly useful for oral administration. Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, solutions, emulsions, foams and liposome-containing formulations. The pharmaceutical compositions and formulations of the present invention may comprise one or more penetration enhancers, carriers, excipients or other active or inactive ingredients.\n\n\nOne of skill in the art will recognize that formulations are routinely designed according to their intended use, i.e. route of administration. Suitable formulations for topical administration include those in which the oligonucleotides of the invention are in admixture with a topical delivery agent such as lipids, liposomes, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, steroids, chelating agents and surfactants. Suitable lipids and liposomes include neutral (e.g. dioleoylphosphatidyl DOPE ethanolamine, dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline DMPC, distearolyphosphatidyl choline) negative (e.g. dimyristoylphosphatidyl glycerol DMPG) and cationic (e.g. dioleoyltetramethylaminopropyl DOTAP and dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine DOTMA). Penetration enhancers and their uses are further described in U.S. Patent 6,287,860. Surfactants and their uses are further described in U.S. Patent 6,287,860. \n\n Compositions and formulations for oral administration include powders or granules, microparticulates, nanoparticulates, suspensions or solutions in water or non-aqueous media, capsules, gel capsules, sachets, tablets or minitablets. Thickeners, flavoring agents, diluents, emulsifϊers, dispersing aids or binders may be desirable. Suitable oral formulations are those in which oligonucleotides of the invention are administered in conjunction with one or more penetration enhancers surfactants and chelators. Suitable surfactants include fatty acids and/or esters or salts thereof, bile acids and/or salts thereof. Suitable bile acids/salts and fatty acids and their uses are further described in U.S. Patent 6,287,860. Also suitable are combinations of penetration enhancers, for example, fatty acids/salts in combination with bile acids/salts. A particularly suitable combination is the sodium salt of lauric acid, capric acid and UDCA.\n\n\nFurther penetration enhancers include polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether. Oligonucleotides of the invention may be delivered orally, in granular form including sprayed dried particles, or complexed to form micro or nanoparticles. Oligonucleotide complexing agents and their uses are further described in U.S. Patent 6,287,860. Oral formulations for oligonucleotides and their preparation are described in detail in U.S. applications 09/108,673 (filed July 1, 1998), 09/315,298 (filed May 20, 1999) and 10/071,822, filed February 8, 2002.\n\n\nIn another related embodiment, therapeutically effective combination therapies may comprise the use of two or more compositions of the invention wherein the multiple compositions are targeted to a single or multiple nucleic acid targets. Numerous examples of antisense oligomeric compounds are known in the art. Two or more combined compounds may be used together or sequentially.\n\n\nThe formulation of therapeutic compositions and their subsequent administration is believed to be within the skill of those in the art. Dosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the disease state to be treated, with the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of the disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient. Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies and repetition rates. Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of individual oligonucleotides, and can generally be estimated based on EC\n50\nS found to be effective in in vitro and in vivo animal models. In general, dosage is from 0.01 μg to 100 g per kg of body weight, and may be given once or more daily, weekly, monthly or yearly. Persons of ordinary skill in the art can easily estimate repetition rates for dosing based on \n\n measured residence times and concentrations of the drug in bodily fluids or tissues. Following successful treatment, it may be desirable to have the patient undergo maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the disease state, wherein the oligonucleotide is administered in maintenance doses, ranging from 0.01 μg to 100 g per kg of body weight, once or more daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. For double-stranded compounds, the dose must be calculated to account for the increased nucleic acid load of the second strand (as with compounds comprising two separate strands) or the additional nucleic acid length (as with self complementary single strands having double-stranded regions).\n\n\nWhile the present invention has been described with specificity in accordance with certain of its embodiments, the following examples serve only to illustrate the invention and are not intended to limit the same.\n\n\nExamples General The sequences listed in the examples have been annotated to indicate where there are modified nucleosides or internucleoside linkages. All non-annotated nucleosides are β-D- ribonucleosides linked by phosphodiester internucleoside linkages. Phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages are indicated by underlining. Modified nucleosides are indicated by a subscripted letter following the capital letter indicating the nucleoside. In particular, subscript \"f\" indicates 2'-fluoro; subscript \"m\" indicates 2'-O-methyl; subscript \"1\" indicates LNA; subscript \"e\" indicates 2'-O-methoxyethyl (MOE); subscript \"p\" indicates 2'-O-propyl; and subscript \"t\" indicates 4'-thio. For example U\nm\n is a modified uridine having a 2'-OCH\n3\n group. A \"d\" preceding a nucleoside indicates a deoxynucleoside such as dT which is deoxythymidine, while \"T\" indicates a thymidine base and a ribo sugar. Some of the strands have a 5'-phosphate group designated as \"P-\". Bolded and italicized \"C\" indicates a 5-methyl C ribonucleoside. Where noted next to the ISIS number of a compound, \"as\" designates the antisense strand, and \"s\" designates the sense strand of the duplex, with respect to the target sequence.\n\n\nThe specific sequences here and throughout the speicification are provided only as examples. Thus, while certain motifs are exemplified using certain sequences, it is to be understood that other sequences could easily be prepared using the same motif of modifications. \n\n Example 1: Synthesis of Nucleoside Phosphoramidites\n\n\nThe preparation of nucleoside phosphoramidites is performed following procedures that are extensively illustrated in the art such as but not limited to US Patent 6,426,220 and published PCT WO 02/36743.\n\n\nExample 2: Oligonucleotide and oligonucleotide synthesis\n\n\nThe oligomeric compounds used in accordance with this invention may be conveniently and routinely made through the well-known technique of solid phase synthesis. Equipment for such synthesis is sold by several vendors including, for example, Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally or alternatively be employed. It is well known to use similar techniques to prepare oligonucleotides such as the phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives.\n\n\nOligonucleotides: Unsubstituted and substituted phosphodiester (P=O) oligonucleotides are synthesized on an automated DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems model 394) using standard phosphoramidite chemistry with oxidation by iodine.\n\n\nPhosphorothioates (P=S) are synthesized similar to phosphodiester oligonucleotides with the following exceptions: thiation was effected by utilizing a 10% w/v solution of 3,H- 1,2- benzodithiole-3-one 1,1-dioxide in acetonitrile for the oxidation of the phosphite linkages. The thiation reaction step time was increased to 180 sec and preceded by the normal capping step. After cleavage from the CPG column and deblocking in concentrated ammonium hydroxide at 55 °C (12-16 hr), the oligonucleotides were recovered by precipitating with >3 volumes of ethanol from a 1 M NH\n4\nOAc solution. Phosphinate oligonucleotides are prepared as described in U.S. Patent 5,508,270.\n\n\nAlkyl phosphonate oligonucleotides are prepared as described in U.S. Patent 4,469,863. 3 '-Deoxy-3' -methylene phosphonate oligonucleotides are prepared as described in U.S.\n\n\nPatents 5,610,289 or 5,625,050.\n\n\nPhosphoramidite oligonucleotides are prepared as described in U.S. Patent, 5,256,775 or U.S. Patent 5,366,878.\n\n\nAlkylphosphonothioate oligonucleotides are prepared as described in published PCT applications PCT/US94/00902 and PCT/US93/06976 (published as WO 94/17093 and WO 94/02499, respectively).\n\n\n3 '-Deoxy-3 '-amino phosphoramidate oligonucleotides are prepared as described in U.S. Patent 5,476,925. \n\n Phosphotriester oligonucleotides are prepared as described in U.S. Patent 5,023,243.\n\n\nBorano phosphate oligonucleotides are prepared as described in U.S. Patents 5,130,302 and 5,177,198.\n\n\nOligonucleosides: Methylenemethylimino linked oligonucleosides, also identified as MMI linked oligonucleosides, methylenedimethylhydrazo linked oligonucleosides, also identified as MDH linked oligonucleosides, and methylenecarbonylamino linked oligonucleosides, also identified as amide-3 linked oligonucleosides, and methyleneaminocarbonyl linked oligonucleosides, also identified as amide-4 linked oligonucleosides, as well as mixed backbone oligomeric compounds having, for instance, alternating MMI and P=O or P=S linkages are prepared as described in U.S. Patents 5,378,825, 5,386,023, 5,489,677, 5,602,240 and 5,610,289.\n\n\nFormacetal and thioformacetal linked oligonucleosides are prepared as described in U.S. Patents 5,264,562 and 5,264,564.\n\n\nEthylene oxide linked oligonucleosides are prepared as described in U.S. Patent 5,223,618.\n\n\nExample 3: Oligonucleotide Isolation\n\n\nAfter cleavage from the controlled pore glass solid support and deblocking in concentrated ammonium hydroxide at 55°C for 12-16 hours, the oligonucleotides or oligonucleosides are recovered by precipitation out of 1 M NH\n4\nOAc with >3 volumes of ethanol. Synthesized oligonucleotides were analyzed by electrospray mass spectroscopy (molecular weight determination) and by capillary gel electrophoresis and judged to be at least 70% full length material. The relative amounts of phosphorothioate and phosphodiester linkages obtained in the synthesis was determined by the ratio of correct molecular weight relative to the -16 amu product (+/-32 +/-48). For some studies oligonucleotides were purified by HPLC, as described by Chiang et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1991, 266, 18162-18171. Results obtained with HPLC-purified material were similar to those obtained with non-HPLC purified material.\n\n\nExample 4: Oligonucleotide Synthesis - 96 Well Plate Format Oligonucleotides can be synthesized via solid phase P(III) phosphoramidite chemistry on an automated synthesizer capable of assembling 96 sequences simultaneously in a 96-well format. Phosphodiester internucleotide linkages are afforded by oxidation with aqueous iodine. Phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages are generated by sulfurization utilizing 3, H- 1,2 \n\n benzodithiole-3-one 1,1 dioxide (Beaucage Reagent) in anhydrous acetonitrile. Standard base- protected beta-cyanoethyl-diiso-propyl phosphoramidites are purchased from commercial vendors (e.g. PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, or Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ). Non- standard nucleosides are synthesized as per standard or patented methods. They are utilized as base protected beta-cyanoethyldiisopropyl phosphoramidites.\n\n\nOligonucleotides are cleaved from support and deprotected with concentrated NH\n4\nOH at elevated temperature (55-60°C) for 12-16 hours and the released product then dried in vacuo. The dried product is then re-suspended in sterile water to afford a master plate from which all analytical and test plate samples are then diluted utilizing robotic pipettors.\n\n\nExample 5: Oligonucleotide Analysis using 96-Well Plate Format\n\n\nThe concentration of oligonucleotide in each well is assessed by dilution of samples and UV absorption spectroscopy. The full-length integrity of the individual products is evaluated by capillary electrophoresis (CE) in either the 96-well format (Beckman P/ ACE™ MDQ) or, for individually prepared samples, on a commercial CE apparatus (e.g., Beckman P/ACE™ 5000, ABI 270). Base and backbone composition is confirmed by mass analysis of the oligomeric compounds utilizing electrospray-mass spectroscopy. All assay test plates are diluted from the master plate using single and multi-channel robotic pipettors. Plates are judged to be acceptable if at least 85% of the oligomeric compounds on the plate are at least 85% full length.\n\n\nExample 6: Cell culture and oligonucleotide treatment\n\n\nThe effect of oligomeric compounds on target nucleic acid expression can be tested in any of a variety of cell types provided that the target nucleic acid is present at measurable levels. This can be routinely determined using, for example, PCR or Northern blot analysis. Cell lines derived from multiple tissues and species can be obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA).\n\n\nThe following cell types are provided for illustrative purposes, but other cell types can be routinely used, provided that the target is expressed in the cell type chosen.

HeLa cells were routinely cultured in DMEM, high glucose (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were routinely passaged by trypsinization and dilution when they reached 90% confluence.

MH-S cells: The mouse alveolar macrophage cell line was obtained from American\n\n\nType Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MH-S cells were cultured in RPMI Medium 1640 with L-glutamine(Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1 OmM HEPES ( all supplements from Invitrogen Life \n\n Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were routinely passaged by trypsinization and dilution when they reached 70-80% confluence.

LIPOFECTIN™\n\n\nWhen cells reached 65-75% confluency, they were treated with oligonucleotide. Oligonucleotide was mixed with LIPOFECTIN™ Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) in Opti-MEM™-1 reduced serum medium (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to achieve the desired concentration of oligonucleotide and a LIPOFECTIN™ concentration of 2.5 or 3 μg/mL per 100 nM oligonucleotide. This transfection mixture was incubated at room temperature for approximately 0.5 hours. For cells grown in 96-well plates, wells were washed once with 100 μL OPTI-MEM™-1 and then treated with 130 μL of the transfection mixture. Cells grown in 24-well plates or other standard tissue culture plates are treated similarly, using appropriate volumes of medium and oligonucleotide. Cells are treated and data are obtained in duplicate or triplicate. After approximately 4-7 hours of treatment at 37°C, the medium containing the transfection mixture was replaced with fresh culture medium. Cells were harvested 16-24 hours after oligonucleotide treatment.\n\n\nOther suitable transfection reagents known in the art include, but are not limited to, CYTOFECTIN™, LIPOFECTAMINE™, OLIGOFECTAMINE™, and FUGENE™. Other suitable transfection methods known in the art include, but are not limited to, electroporation.\n\n\nThe concentration of oligonucleotide used varies from cell line to cell line. To determine the optimal oligonucleotide concentration for a particular cell line, the cells are treated with a positive control oligonucleotide at a range of concentrations. For human cells the positive \n\n control oligonucleotide is selected from either ISIS 13920\n\n\n(TeCeCeGTCATCGCTCeCeTeCeAeGeGeGe, SEQ ID NO: 1) which is targeted to human H-ras, or ISIS 18078, (GeTeGeCeGgCGCGAGCCCGeAeAeAeTeCe, SEQ ID NO: 2) which is targeted to human Jun-N-terminal kinase-2 (JNK2). Both controls are 2'-O-methoxyethyl gapmers with a phosphorothioate backbone. For mouse or rat cells the positive control oligonucleotide is ISIS 15770 (AeTeGeCeAeTTCTGCCCCCAeAeGeGeAe, SEQ ID NO: 3), a 2'-O-methoxyethyl gapmer with a phosphorothioate backbone which is targeted to both mouse and rat c-raf. The concentration of positive control oligonucleotide that results in 80% inhibition of c-H-ras (for ISIS 13920), JNK2 (for ISIS 18078) or c-raf (for ISIS 15770) mRNA is then utilized as the screening concentration for new oligonucleotides in subsequent experiments for that cell line. If 80% inhibition is not achieved, the lowest concentration of positive control oligonucleotide that results in 60% inhibition of c-H-ras, JNK2 or c-raf mRNA is then utilized as the oligonucleotide screening concentration in subsequent experiments for that cell line. If 60% inhibition is not achieved, that particular cell line is deemed as unsuitable for oligonucleotide transfection experiments.\n\n\nExample 7: Analysis of oligonucleotide inhibition of a target expression\n\n\nAntisense modulation of a target expression can be assayed in a variety of ways known in the art. For example, a target mRNA levels can be quantitated by, e.g., Northern blot analysis, competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or real-time PCR. Real-time quantitative PCR is presently desired. RNA analysis can be performed on total cellular RNA or poly(A)+ mRNA. One method of RNA analysis of the present invention is the use of total cellular RNA as described in other examples herein. Methods of RNA isolation are well known in the art. Northern blot analysis is also routine in the art. Real-time quantitative (PCR) can be conveniently accomplished using the commercially available ABI PRISM™ 7600, 7700, or 7900 Sequence Detection System, available from PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA and used according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\nProtein levels of a target can be quantitated in a variety of ways well known in the art, such as immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis (immunoblotting), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Antibodies directed to a target can be identified and obtained from a variety of sources, such as the MSRS catalog of antibodies (Aerie Corporation, Birmingham, MI), or can be prepared via conventional monoclonal or polyclonal antibody generation methods well known in the art. Methods for \n\n preparation of polyclonal antisera are taught in, for example, Ausubel, F. M. et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Volume 2, pp. 1 1.12.1-11.12.9, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1997. Preparation of monoclonal antibodies is taught in, for example, Ausubel, F. M. et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Volume 2, pp. 1 1.4.1-11.11.5, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1997. Immunoprecipitation methods are standard in the art and can be found at, for example,\n\n\nAusubel, F.M. et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Volume 2, pp. 10.16.1-10.16.11, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1998. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis is standard in the art and can be found at, for example, Ausubel, F.M. et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Volume 2, pp. 10.8.1-10.8.21, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1997. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are standard in the art and can be found at, for example, Ausubel, F.M. et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Volume 2, pp. 11.2.1-11.2.22, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1991.\n\n\nExample 8: Design of phenotypic assays and in vivo studies for the use of target inhibitors Phenotypic assays\n\n\nOnce target inhibitors have been identified by the methods disclosed herein, the oligomeric compounds are further investigated in one or more phenotypic assays, each having measurable endpoints predictive of efficacy in the treatment of a particular disease state or condition. Phenotypic assays, kits and reagents for their use are well known to those skilled in the art and are herein used to investigate the role and/or association of a target in health and disease. Representative phenotypic assays, which can be purchased from any one of several commercial vendors, include those for determining cell viability, cytotoxicity, proliferation or cell survival (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; PerkinElmer, Boston, MA), protein-based assays including enzymatic assays (Panvera, LLC, Madison, WI; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ; Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA), cell regulation, signal transduction, inflammation, oxidative processes and apoptosis (Assay Designs Inc., Ann Arbor, MI), triglyceride accumulation (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), angiogenesis assays, tube formation assays, cytokine and hormone assays and metabolic assays (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA; Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).\n\n\nIn one non-limiting example, cells determined to be appropriate for a particular phenotypic assay (i.e., MCF-7 cells selected for breast cancer studies; adipocytes for obesity studies) are treated with a target inhibitors identified from the in vitro studies as well as control \n\n compounds at optimal concentrations which are determined by the methods described above. At the end of the treatment period, treated and untreated cells are analyzed by one or more methods specific for the assay to determine phenotypic outcomes and endpoints.\n\n\nPhenotypic endpoints include changes in cell morphology over time or treatment dose as well as changes in levels of cellular components such as proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, hormones, saccharides or metals. Measurements of cellular status which include pH, stage of the cell cycle, intake or excretion of biological indicators by the cell, are also endpoints of interest.\n\n\nMeasurement of the expression of one or more of the genes of the cell after treatment is also used as an indicator of the efficacy or potency of the a target inhibitors. Hallmark genes, or those genes suspected to be associated with a specific disease state, condition, or phenotype, are measured in both treated and untreated cells. In vivo studies\n\n\nThe individual subjects of the in vivo studies described herein are warm-blooded vertebrate animals, which includes humans. A clinical trial is subjected to rigorous controls to ensure that individuals are not unnecessarily put at risk and that they are fully informed about their role in the study.\n\n\nTo account for the psychological effects of receiving treatments, volunteers are randomly given placebo or a target inhibitor. Furthermore, to prevent the doctors from being biased in treatments, they are not informed as to whether the medication they are administering is a a target inhibitor or a placebo. Using this randomization approach, each volunteer has the same chance of being given either the new treatment or the placebo.\n\n\nVolunteers receive either the a target inhibitor or placebo for eight week period with biological parameters associated with the indicated disease state or condition being measured at the beginning (baseline measurements before any treatment), end (after the final treatment), and at regular intervals during the study period. Such measurements include the levels of nucleic acid molecules encoding a target or a target protein levels in body fluids, tissues or organs compared to pre-treatment levels. Other measurements include, but are not limited to, indices of the disease state or condition being treated, body weight, blood pressure, serum titers of pharmacologic indicators of disease or toxicity as well as ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) measurements.\n\n\nInformation recorded for each patient includes age (years), gender, height (cm), family history of disease state or condition (yes/no), motivation rating (some/moderate/great) and number and type of previous treatment regimens for the indicated disease or condition. \n\n Volunteers taking part in this study are healthy adults (age 18 to 65 years) and roughly an equal number of males and females participate in the study. Volunteers with certain characteristics are equally distributed for placebo and a target inhibitor treatment. In general, the volunteers treated with placebo have little or no response to treatment, whereas the volunteers treated with the target inhibitor show positive trends in their disease state or condition index at the conclusion of the study.\n\n\nExample 9 : RNA Isolation\n\n\nPoIy(A)+ mRNA isolation PoIy(A)+ mRNA is isolated according to Miura et al., (Clin. Chem., 1996, 42, 1758-\n\n\n1764). Other methods for poly(A)+ mRNA isolation are routine in the art. Briefly, for cells grown on 96-well plates, growth medium was removed from the cells and each well was washed with 200 μL cold PBS. 60 μL lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 20 mM vanadyl-ribonucleoside complex) was added to each well, the plate was gently agitated and then incubated at room temperature for five minutes. 55 μL of lysate was transferred to Oligo d(T) coated 96-well plates (AGCT Inc., Irvine CA). Plates were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature, washed 3 times with 200 μL of wash buffer (10 mM Tris- HCl pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 M NaCl). After the final wash, the plate was blotted on paper towels to remove excess wash buffer and then air-dried for 5 minutes. 60 μL of elution buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6), preheated to 70°C, was added to each well, the plate was incubated on a 90°C hot plate for 5 minutes, and the eluate was then transferred to a fresh 96-well plate. Cells grown on 100 mm or other standard plates may be treated similarly, using appropriate volumes of all solutions. Total RNA Isolation Total RNA is isolated using an RNEASY 96™ kit and buffers purchased from Qiagen\n\n\nInc. (Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's recommended procedures. Briefly, for cells grown on 96-well plates, growth medium is removed from the cells and each well is washed with 200 μL cold PBS. 150 μL Buffer RLT is added to each well and the plate vigorously agitated for 20 seconds. 150 μL of 70% ethanol is then added to each well and the contents mixed by pipetting three times up and down. The samples are then transferred to the RNEASY 96™ well plate attached to a QIA V AC™ manifold fitted with a waste collection tray and attached to a vacuum source. Vacuum is applied for 1 minute. 500 μL of Buffer RWl is added to each well of the RNEASY 96™ plate and incubated for 15 minutes and the vacuum is again applied for 1 \n\n minute. An additional 500 μL of Buffer RWl is added to each well of the RNEASY 96™ plate and the vacuum is applied for 2 minutes. 1 mL of Buffer RPE is then added to each well of the RNEASY 96™ plate and the vacuum applied for a period of 90 seconds. The Buffer RPE wash is then repeated and the vacuum is applied for an additional 3 minutes. The plate is then removed from the QIAV AC™ manifold and blotted dry on paper towels. The plate is then reattached to the QIA VAC™ manifold fitted with a collection tube rack containing 1.2 mL collection tubes. RNA is then eluted by pipetting 140 μL of RNAse free water into each well, incubating 1 minute, and then applying the vacuum for 3 minutes.\n\n\nThe repetitive pipetting and elution steps may be automated using a QIAGEN Bio- Robot 9604 (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia CA). Essentially, after lysing of the cells on the culture plate, the plate is transferred to the robot deck where the pipetting, DNase treatment and elution steps are carried out.\n\n\nExample 10: Design and screening of duplexed antisense compounds In accordance with the present invention, a series of nucleic acid duplexes comprising the compounds of the present invention and their complements can be designed. The nucleobase sequence of the antisense strand of the duplex comprises at least a portion of an antisense oligonucleotide targeted to a target sequence as described herein. The ends of the strands may be modified by the addition of one or more natural or modified nucleobases to form an overhang. The sense strand of the dsRNA is then designed and synthesized as the complement of the antisense strand and may also contain modifications or additions to either terminus. For example, in one embodiment, both strands of the dsRNA duplex would be complementary over the central nucleobases, each having overhangs at one or both termini.\n\n\nFor example, a duplex comprising an antisense strand having the sequence CGAGAGGCGGACGGGACCG (SEQ ID NO: 20) and having a two-nucleobase overhang of deoxythymidine(dT) would have the following structure:\n\n\n \n\n In another embodiment, a duplex comprising an antisense strand having the same sequence CGAGAGGCGGACGGGACCG (SEQ ID NO: 20) may be prepared with blunt ends (no single stranded overhang) as shown: \n\n \n\n\nRNA strands of the duplex can be synthesized by methods disclosed herein or purchased from Dharmacon Research Inc., (Lafayette, CO). Once synthesized, the complementary strands are annealed. The single strands are aliquoted and diluted to a concentration of 50 μM. Once diluted, 30 μL of each strand is combined with 15μL of a 5X solution of annealing buffer. The final concentration of the buffer is 100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, and 2mM magnesium acetate. The final volume is 75 μL. This solution is incubated for 1 minute at 90°C and then centrifuged for 15 seconds. The tube is allowed to sit for 1 hour at 37°C at which time the dsRNA duplexes are used in experimentation. The final concentration of the dsRNA duplex is 20 μM.\n\n\nOnce prepared, the duplexed compounds are evaluated for their ability to modulate target mRNA levels When cells reach 80% confluency, they are treated with duplexed compounds of the invention. For cells grown in 96-well plates, wells are washed once with 200 μL OPTI-MEM- 1™ reduced-serum medium (Gibco BRL) and then treated with 130 μL of OPTI-MEM- 1™ containing 5 μg/mL LIPOFECT AMINE 2000™ (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and the duplex antisense compound at the desired final concentration. After about 4 hours of treatment, the medium is replaced with fresh medium. Cells are harvested 16 hours after treatment, at which time RNA is isolated and target reduction measured by quantitative real-time PCR as described herein.\n\n\nExample 11: Real-time Quantitative PCR Analysis of target mRNA Levels\n\n\nQuantitation of a target mRNA levels was accomplished by real-time quantitative PCR using the ABI PRISM™ 7600, 7700, or 7900 Sequence Detection System (PE-Applied\n\n\nBiosystems, Foster City, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. This is a closed-tube, non-gel-based, fluorescence detection system which allows high-throughput quantitation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products in real-time. As opposed to standard PCR in which amplification products are quantitated after the PCR is completed, products in real-time quantitative PCR are quantitated as they accumulate. This is accomplished by including in the PCR reaction an oligonucleotide probe that anneals specifically between the forward and reverse PCR primers, and contains two fluorescent dyes. A reporter dye (e.g., FAM or JOE, obtained from either PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, Operon Technologies Inc., Alameda, CA \n\n or Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, IA) is attached to the 5' end of the probe and a quencher dye (e.g., TAMRA, obtained from either PE-Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, Operon Technologies Inc., Alameda, CA or Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, IA) is attached to the 3' end of the probe. When the probe and dyes are intact, reporter dye emission is quenched by the proximity of the 3' quencher dye. During amplification, annealing of the probe to the target sequence creates a substrate that can be cleaved by the 5'-exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase. During the extension phase of the PCR amplification cycle, cleavage of the probe by Taq polymerase releases the reporter dye from the remainder of the probe (and hence from the quencher moiety) and a sequence-specific fluorescent signal is generated. With each cycle, additional reporter dye molecules are cleaved from their respective probes, and the fluorescence intensity is monitored at regular intervals by laser optics built into the ABI PRISM™ Sequence Detection System. In each assay, a series of parallel reactions containing serial dilutions of mRNA from untreated control samples generates a standard curve that is used to quantitate the percent inhibition after antisense oligonucleotide treatment of test samples. Prior to quantitative PCR analysis, primer-probe sets specific to the target gene being measured are evaluated for their ability to be \"multiplexed\" with a GAPDH amplification reaction. In multiplexing, both the target gene and the internal standard gene GAPDH are amplified concurrently in a single sample. In this analysis, mRNA isolated from untreated cells is serially diluted. Each dilution is amplified in the presence of primer-probe sets specific for GAPDH only, target gene only (\"single-plexing\"), or both (multiplexing). Following PCR amplification, standard curves of GAPDH and target mRNA signal as a function of dilution are generated from both the single-plexed and multiplexed samples. If both the slope and correlation coefficient of the GAPDH and target signals generated from the multiplexed samples fall within 10% of their corresponding values generated from the single-plexed samples, the primer-probe set specific for that target is deemed multiplexable. Other methods of PCR are also known in the art.\n\n\nRT and PCR reagents were obtained from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). RT, real-time PCR was carried out by adding 20 μL PCR cocktail (2.5x PCR buffer minus MgCl\n2\n, 6.6 mM MgCl\n2\n, 375 μM each of dATP, dCTP, dCTP and dGTP, 375 nM each of forward primer and reverse primer, 125 nM of probe, 4 Units RNAse inhibitor, 1.25 Units PLATINUM® Taq, 5 Units MuLV reverse transcriptase, and 2.5x ROX dye) to 96-well plates containing 30 μL total RNA solution (20-200 ng). The RT reaction was carried out by incubation for 30 minutes at 48°C. Following a 10 minute incubation at 95°C to activate the PLATINUM® Taq, 40 cycles of \n\n a two-step PCR protocol were carried out: 95°C for 15 seconds (denaturation) followed by 60°C for 1.5 minutes (annealing/extension).\n\n\nGene target quantities obtained by RT, real-time PCR are normalized using either the expression level of GAPDH, a gene whose expression is constant, or by quantifying total RNA using RIBOGREEN™ (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR). GAPDH expression is quantified by real time RT-PCR, by being run simultaneously with the target, multiplexing, or separately. Total RNA is quantified using RiboGreen™ RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR). Methods of RNA quantification by RIBOGREEN™ are taught in Jones, L. J., et al, (Analytical Biochemistry, 1998, 265, 368-374). In this assay, 170 μL of RIBOGREEN™ working reagent (RIBOGREEN™ reagent diluted 1 :350 in 1OmM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) is pipetted into a 96-well plate containing 30 μL purified, cellular RNA. The plate is read in a CytoFluor 4000 (PE Applied Biosystems) with excitation at 485nm and emission at 530nm.\n\n\nExample 12: Target-specific primers and probes\n\n\nProbes and primers may be designed to hybridize to a target sequence, using published sequence information.\n\n\nFor example, for human PTEN, the following primer-probe set was designed using published sequence information (GENBANK™ accession number U92436.1, SEQ ID NO: 4). Forward primer: AATGGCTAAGTGAAGATGACAATCAT (SEQ ID NO: 5)\n\n\nReverse primer: TGCACATATCATTACACCAGTTCGT (SEQ ID NO: 6) And the PCR probe:\n\n\nFAM-TTGCAGCAATTCACTGTAAAGCTGGAAAGG-TAMRA (SEQ ID NO: 7), where FAM is the fluorescent dye and TAMRA is the quencher dye. For example, for human survivin, the following primer-probe set was designed using published sequence information (GENBANK™ accession number NM_001168.1, SEQ ID NO: 8).\n\n\nForward primer: CACCACTTCCAGGGTTTATTCC (SEQ ID NO: 9)\n\n\nReverse primer: TGATCTCCTTTCCTAAGACATTGCT (SEQ ID NO: 10) And the PCR probe: FAM-ACCAGCCTTCCTGTGGGCCCCT-TAMRA (SEQ ID NO: 11), where FAM is the fluorescent dye and TAMRA is the quencher dye.\n\n\nFor example, for human eIF4E, the following primer-probe set was designed using published sequence information (GENBANK™ accession number Ml 5353.1, SEQ ID NO: 12). \n\n Forward primer: TGGCGACTGTCGAACCG (SEQ ID NO: 13)\n\n\nReverse primer: AGATTCCGTTTTCTCCTCTTCTGTAG (SEQ ID NO: 14)\n\n\nAnd the PCR probe:\n\n\nFAM-AAACCACCCCTACTCCTAATCCCCCG-TAMRA (SEQ ID NO: 15), where FAM is the fluorescent dye and TAMRA is the quencher dye.\n\n\nFor example, for mouse eIF4E, the following primer-probe set was designed using published sequence information (GENBANK™ accession number NM_007917.2, SEQ ID NO: 16). Forward primer: AGGACGGTGGCTGATCACA (SEQ ID NO: 17) Reverse primer: TCTCTAGCCAGAAGCGATCGA (SEQ ID NO: 18) And the PCR probe:\n\n\nFAM-TGAACAAGCAGCAGAGACGGAGTGA-TAMRA (SEQ ID NO: 19), where FAM is the fluorescent dye and TAMRA is the quencher dye.\n\n\nExample 13: Northern blot analysis of a target mRNA levels Eighteen hours after antisense treatment, cell monolayers were washed twice with cold\n\n\nPBS and lysed in 1 niL RNAZOL™ (TEL-TEST \"B\" Inc., Friendswood, TX). Total RNA was prepared following manufacturer's recommended protocols. Twenty micrograms of total RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis through 1.2% agarose gels containing 1.1% formaldehyde using a MOPS buffer system (AMRESCO, Inc. Solon, OH). RNA was transferred from the gel to HYB0ND™-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) by overnight capillary transfer using a Northern/Southern Transfer buffer system (TEL-TEST \"B\" Inc., Friendswood, TX). RNA transfer was confirmed by UV visualization. Membranes were fixed by UV cross-linking using a STRATALINKER™ UV Crosslinker 2400 (Stratagene, Inc, La Jolla, CA) and then probed using QUICKHYB™ hybridization solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using manufacturer's recommendations for stringent conditions.\n\n\nTo detect human a target, a human a target specific primer probe set is prepared by PCR. To normalize for variations in loading and transfer efficiency membranes are stripped and probed for human glyceraldehyde-3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) RNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Hybridized membranes were visualized and quantitated using a\n\n\nPHOSPHORIMAGER™ and IMAGEQUANT™ Software V3.3 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Data was normalized to GAPDH levels in untreated controls. \n\n Example 14: Western blot analysis of target protein levels\n\n\nWestern blot analysis (immunoblot analysis) is carried out using standard methods. Cells are harvested 16-20 h after oligonucleotide treatment, washed once with PBS, suspended in Laemmli buffer (100 μl/well), boiled for 5 minutes and loaded on a 16% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels are run for 1.5 hours at 150 V, and transferred to membrane for western blotting. Appropriate primary antibody directed to a target is used, with a radiolabeled or fluorescently labeled secondary antibody directed against the primary antibody species. Bands are visualized using a PHOSPHORIMAGER™ (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale CA).\n\n\nExample 15: In vitro assay of selected differentially modified siRNAs\n\n\nDifferentially modified siRNA duplexes designed to target human survivin using published sequence information were prepared and assayed as described below. The antisense strand was held constant as a 4'-thio gapped strand and 3 different sense strands were compared. The nucleosides are annotated as to chemical modification as per the legend at the beginning of the examples.\n\n\n \n\n The differentially modified siRNA duplexes were assayed for their ability to inhibit target mRNA levels in HeLa cells. Culture methods used for HeLa cells are available from the ATCC and may be found, for example, at www (dot)atcc.org. For cells grown in 96-well plates, wells were washed once with 200 μL OPTI-MEM-I reduced-serum medium and then treated with 130 μL of OPTI-MEM-I containing 12 μg/mL LIPOFECTIN™ (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and the dsRNA at the desired concentrations. After about 5 hours of treatment, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were harvested 16 hours after treatment, at which time RNA was isolated and target reduction measured by RT-PCR as \n\n previously described.

The compounds tested were 19 nucleotides in length having phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages throughout. HeLa cells were treated with the double stranded oligomeric compounds (siRNA constructs) shown below (antisense strand followed by the sense strand of the duplex) at concentrations of 0, 0.15, 1.5, 15, and 150 nM using methods described herein. The nucleosides are annotated as to chemical modification as per the legend at the beginning of the examples. Expression levels of human PTEN were determined by quantitative real-time PCR and normalized to RIBOGREEN™ as described in other examples herein.

The nucleosides are annotated as to chemical modification as per the legend at the beginning of the examples. Each treatment group was comprised of four animals. Animals were dosed via intraperitoneal injection twice per day for 4.5 days, for a total of 9 doses per animal. Saline-injected animals served as negative controls. Animals were sacrificed 6 hours after the last dose was administered, and plasma samples and tissues were harvested. Target reduction in liver was also measured at the conclusion of the study. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo different doses of each treatment were tested. Treatment with ISIS 116847, was administered at doses of 12.5 mg/kg twice daily or at 6.25 mg/kg twice daily.\n\n\nThe siRNA constructs described above (unmodified 341391/341401, 359995/359996 both strands modified) were administered at doses of 25 mg/kg twice daily or 6.25 mg/kg twice daily. Each siRNA is composed of an antisense strand and a complementary sense strand as per previous examples, with the antisense strand targeted to mouse PTEN. ISIS 116847 and all of the siRNAs of this experiment also have perfect complementarity with human PTEN.\n\n\nPTEN mPvNA levels in liver were measured at the end of the study using real-time PCR and RIBOGREEN™ RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR) as taught in previous examples above. Results are presented in the table below as the average % inhibition of mRNA expression for each treatment group, normalized to saline-injected control.\n\n\nTarget reduction by modified siRNAs targeted to PTEN in mouse liver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the Table above, all oligonucleotides targeted to PTEN caused a reduction in mRNA levels in liver as compared to saline-treated control. The mRNA levels measured for the ISIS 341391/341401 duplex are also suggestive of dose-dependent inhibition.\n\n\nThe effects of treatment with the RNA duplexes on plasma glucose levels were evaluated in the mice treated as described above. Glucose levels were measured using routine \n\n clinical analyzer instruments (eg. Ascencia Glucometer Elite XL, Bayer, Tarrytown, NY). Approximate average plasma glucose is presented in the Table below for each treatment group.\n\n\nEffects of modified siRNAs targeted to PTEN on plasma glucose levels in normal mice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo assess the physiological effects resulting from in vivo siRNA targeted to PTEN mRNA, the mice were evaluated at the end of the treatment period for plasma triglycerides, plasma cholesterol, and plasma transaminase levels. Routine clinical analyzer instruments (eg. Olympus Clinical Analyzer, Melville, NY) were used to measure plasma triglycerides, cholesterol, and transaminase levels. Plasma cholesterol levels from animals treated with either dose of ISIS 116847 were increased about 20% over levels measured for saline-treated animals. Conversely, the cholesterol levels measured for animals treated with either the 25 mg/kg or the 6.25 mg/kg doses of the ISIS 341391/341401 duplex were decreased about 12% as compared to saline-treated controls. The ISIS 359996/359995 duplex did not cause significant alterations in cholesterol levels. All of the treatment groups showed decreased plasma triglycerides as compared to saline-treated control, regardless of treatment dose.\n\n\nIncreases in the transaminases ALT and AST can indicate hepatotoxicity. The transaminase levels measured for mice treated with the siRNA duplexes were not elevated to a level indicative of hepatotoxicity with respect to saline treated control. Treatment with 12.5 mg/kg doses of ISIS 116847 caused approximately 7-fold and 3-fold increases in ALT and AST levels, respectively. Treatment with the lower doses (6.25 mg/kg) of ISIS 116847 caused approximately 4-fold and 2-fold increases in ALT and AST levels, respectively.\n\n\nAt the end of the study, liver, white adipose tissue (WAT), spleen, and kidney were harvested from animals treated with the oligomeric compounds and were weighed to assess gross organ alterations. Approximate average tissue weights for each treatment group are presented in the table below. \n\n Effects of chemically modified siRNAs targeted to PTEN on tissue weight in normal mice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides or siRNA duplexes targeted to PTEN did not substantially alter liver, WAT, spleen, or kidney weights in normal mice as compared to the organ weights of mice treated with saline alone.\n\n\nExample 43: Chemically modified siRNA targeted to PTEN: in vivo study\n\n\nSix- to seven- week old Balb/c mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were injected with compounds targeted to PTEN.

Saline-injected animals served as negative controls. Animals were sacrificed 6 hours after the last dose of oligonucleotide was administered, and plasma samples and tissues were harvested. Target reduction in liver was also measured at the conclusion of the study.\n\n\nTwo doses of each treatment were tested. Treatment with ISIS 116847 (5'- CTGCTAGCCTCTGGATTTGA-3', SEQ ID NO: 63), a 5-10-5 gapmer was administered at doses of 12.5 mg/kg twice daily or at 6.25 mg/kg twice daily. The siRNA compounds described below were administered at doses of 25 mg/kg twice daily or 6.25 mg/kg twice daily. Each siRNA is composed of an antisense and complement strand as described in previous examples, with the antisense strand targeted to mouse PTEN. ISIS 116847 and all of the siRNAs of this experiment also have perfect complementarity with human PTEN.\n\n\nAn siRNA duplex targeted to PTEN is comprised of antisense strand ISIS 341391 (5'- UUGUCUCUGGUCCUUACUU-3', SEQ ID NO: 26) and the sense strand ISIS 341401 (5'- AAGUAAGGACCAGAGACAA-S ', SEQ ID NO: 27). Both strands of the ISIS 341391/341401 duplex are comprised of ribonucleosides with phosphodiester internucleoside linkages. \n\n Another siRNA duplex targeted to human PTEN is comprised of antisense strand ISIS 342851 (5'-UUUGUCUCUGGUCCUUACUU-3 ', SEQ ID NO: 40) and the sense strand ISIS 308746 (5'-AAGUAAGGACCAGAGACAAA-3 ', SEQ ID NO: 39). The antisense strand, ISIS 342851, is comprised of a central RNA region with 4'-thioribose nucleosides at positions 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 18, 19, and 20, indicated in bold. The sense strand, ISIS 308746, is comprised of ribonucleosides, and both strands of the ISIS 342851/308746 duplex have phosphodiester internucleoside linkages throughout.\n\n\nPTEN mRNA levels in liver were measured at the end of the study using real-time PCR and RIBOGREEN™ RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR) as taught in previous examples above. PTEN mRNA levels were determined relative to total RNA or GAPDH expression, prior to normalization to saline-treated control. Results are presented in the following table as the average % inhibition of mRNA expression for each treatment group, normalized to saline-injected control.\n\n\nTarget reduction by chemically modified siRNAs targeted to PTEN in mouse liver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in the table, the oligonucleotides targeted to PTEN decreased mRNA levels relative to saline-treated controls. The mRNA levels measured for the ISIS 341391/341401 duplex are also suggestive of dose-dependent inhibition.\n\n\nThe effects of treatment with the RNA duplexes on plasma glucose levels were evaluated in the mice treated as described above. Glucose levels were measured using routine clinical analyzer instruments (eg. Ascencia Glucometer Elite XL, Bayer, Tarrytown, NY). Approximate average plasma glucose is presented in the following table for each treatment group. \n\n Effects of chemically modified siRNAs targeted to PTEN on plasma glucose levels in normal mice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo assess the physiological effects resulting from in vivo siRNA targeted to PTEN mRNA, the mice were evaluated at the end of the treatment period for plasma triglycerides, plasma cholesterol, and plasma transaminase levels.

The other treatments did not cause substantial alterations in cholesterol levels. All of the treatment groups showed decreased plasma triglycerides as compared to saline- treated control, regardless of treatment dose. Increases in the transaminases ALT and AST can indicate hepatotoxicity. The transaminase levels measured for mice treated with the siRNA duplexes were not elevated to a level indicative of hepatotoxicity with respect to saline treated control.

Biochem., 1996, 235, 36-43; Geary, Anal. Biochem., 1999, 274, 241-248. Heparin-treated mouse plasma, from 3-6 month old female Balb/c mice (Charles River Labs) was thawed from - 80 °C and diluted to 25% (v/v) with phosphate buffered saline (140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 niM potassium phosphate, 10 mM sodium phosphate). Approximately 10 nmol of pre-annealed siRNA, at a concentration of 100 μM, was added to the 25% plasma and incubated at 37 °C for 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, and 420 minutes. Aliquots were removed at the indicated time, treated with EDTA to a final concentration of 2 mM, and placed on ice at 0 °C until analyzed by capillary gel electrophoresis (Beckman P/ ACE MDQ-UV with eCap DNA Capillary tube). The area of the siRNA duplex peak was measured and used to calculate the percent of intact siRNA remaining. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was added at a concentration of 2.5 mM to each injection as an internal calibration standard. A zero time point was taken by diluting siRNA in phosphate buffered saline followed by capillary electrophoresis. Percent intact siRNA was plotted against time, allowing the calculation of a pseudo first-order half-life. Results are shown in the Table below. ISIS 338918 (UCUU AUCACCUUUAGCUCUA, SEQ ID NO: 54) and ISIS 338943 are unmodified RNA strand with phosphodiester linkages throughout. ISIS 351831 is annotated as UmCfUmUfAmUfCmAfCmCfUmUfUmAfG\nm\nCfUmCfUm (SEQ ID NO: 58) \n\n and ISIS 351832 as AfG\nm\nAfG\nm\nCfU\nm\nAfA\nm\nAfG\nm\nGfU\nm\nG\nf\nA\nm\nUfA\nm\nAfG\nm\nAf (SEQ ID NO: 59) in other examples herein.\n\n\nStability of alternating 2'-0-methyl/2'-fluoro siRNA constructs in mouse plasma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parent (unmodified) construct is approximately 50% degraded after 30 minutes and nearly gone after 4 hours (completely gone at 6 hours). In contrast, the alternating 2'-O- methyl/2'-fluoro construct remains relatively unchanged and 75% remains even after 6 hours.\n\n\nExample 45: In vivo inhibition of survivin expression in a human glioblastoma xenograft tumor model\n\n\nThe U-87MG human glioblastoma xenograft tumor model (Kiaris et al., 2000, May- Jun; 2(3):242-50) was used to demonstrate the antitumor activity of selected compositions of the present invention. A total of 8 CDl nu/nu (Charles River) mice were used for each group. For implantation, tumor cells were trypsinized, washed in PBS and resuspended in PBS at 4 X 10\n6\n cells/mL in DMEM. Just before implantation, animals were irradiated (450 TBI) and the cells were mixed in Matrigel (1 :1). A total of 4 X 10\n6\n tumor cells in a 0.2 mL volume were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) in the left rear flank of each mouse. Treatment with the selected double stranded compositions (dissolved in 0.9% NaCl, injection grade), or vehicle (0.9% NaCl) was started 4 days post tumor cell implantation. The compositions were administered intravenously (i.v.) in a 0.2 mL volume eight hours apart on day one and four hours apart on day two. Tissues (tumor, liver, kidney, serum) were collected two hours after the last dose. Tumors from eight animals from each group were homogenized for western evaluation. Survivin levels were determined and compared to saline controls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble stranded construct Activity\n\n\nAntisense Sense % Inhibition of Survivin\n\n\n343868 343867 none 355713 355714 60\n\n\n353537 343868 48\n\n\n352506 352514 44\n\n\nThe data demonstrate that modified chemistries can be used to stabilize the constructs resulting in activity not seen with the unmodified construct.\n\n\nExample 46: Chemically modified siRNA targeted to PTEN: in vivo study\n\n\nSix- to seven-week old Balb/c mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were treated with oligomeric compounds targeted to PTEN. Each treatment group was comprised of five animals. Animals were dosed via intraperitoneal injection daily for four days. Saline-injected animals served as negative controls. Animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the last dosing and liver and spleen samples were harvested. Target reduction in liver was also measured at the conclusion of the study.\n\n\nIncluded in the study were chemically modified siRNA duplexes, one unmodified siRNA duplex and a single strand 5-10-5 MOE gapmer (116847, SEQ ID NO: 67). The animals were dosed at 80 mg/kg (duplexes) and 40 mg/kg (single strand) daily. The siRNA duplexes were composed of an antisense strand targeted to mouse PTEN paired with a sense strand. The single strand 5-10-5 MOE gapmer (116847, SEQ ID NO: 67) and the antisense strands of the siRNA duplexes used in this experiment also have perfect complementarity with human PTEN.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sense strand (398249) has a C\n16\n lipophilic conjugate group attached at the 3'-end via a bivalent linking group (L) which is further attached to a phosphorothioate group. The structure of the entire group which is attached to the 3 '-carbon of the terminal nucleoside is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPTEN mRNA levels in liver were measured at the end of the study using real-time PCR and RIBOGREEN® RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR) according to standard protocols. PTEN mRNA levels were determined relative to total RNA (using Ribogreen), prior to normalization to saline-treated control. Results are presented in the table below as the average % inhibition of mRNA expression for each treatment group, normalized to saline-injected control.\n\n\nCompound (sense/antisense) Dose (mg/kg) % Inhibition 116847 40 79\n\n\n398249/398262 80 52\n\n\n398249/398256 80 39\n\n\n398239/398256 80 0\n\n\n341401/341391 80 0\n\n\nIn vivo activity was demonstrated for siRNA duplexes having a linked conjugate at the 3'- end of the sense strand and an overhang of 2 nuclease resistant 2'-modified nucleosides at the 3'- end of the antisense strand. The use of at least two phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages at the 3'-end of the antisense strand may also be important for in vivo activity. When the number of phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages at the 3 '-end of the antisense strand was increased \n\n from 2 (398249/398256) to 7 (398249/398262) a further increase in activity was observed. Removal of the conjugate group resulted in no measurable activity (398239/39825).\n\n\nIn addition to PTEN mRNA levels, liver transaminase levels, alanine aminotranferease (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), in serum were also measured relative to saline injected mice. The approximate liver transaminase levels are listed in the table below.\n\n\nCompound Dose (mε/kε) ALT (% change) AST (% change)\n\n\n116847 40 33 70\n\n\n398249/398262 80 -30 0 398249/398256 80 -33 23\n\n\n398239/398256 80 -23 30\n\n\n341401/341391 80 -28 -20\n\n\nThe measured transaminase levels for mice treated with the siRNA duplexes, 398249/398262, 398249/398256 and 341401/341391 were not elevated to a level indicative of hepatotoxicity.\n\n\nThe effects on liver and spleen weights were also determined. Significant changes in liver and spleen weight can indicate that a particular compound causes toxic effects. The data are expressed as percent change in body or organ weight (\"+\" indicates an increase, \"-\" indicates a decrease). The results are listed in the table below.\n\n\nCompound Dose (mε/kε) Liverweight Spleen weight\n\n\nSaline N/A 1.12 0.08\n\n\n116847 40 1.42 (+27%) 0.08 398249/398262 80 1.08 (-4%) 0.09 (+12%)\n\n\n398249/398256 80 1.20 (+7%) 0.10 (+25%)\n\n\n398239/398256 80 1.30 (+16%) 0.12 (+50%)\n\n\n341401/341391 80 1.10 (-2%) 0.08\n\n\nAs listed in the table, treatment with siRNA duplexes, 398249/398262 and\n\n\n398249/398256, did not alter spleen weights, within experimental error, in normal mice as compared to the organ weights of mice treated with saline alone to a level that would indicate a \n\n significant toxic effect. The changes in organ weight were within the normal range seen when animals are treated with oligonucleotides that are considered nontoxic.\n\n\nThe accumulation of siRNAs in liver was also determined histologically following routine procedures. Liver samples were procured, fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and processed for staining with hematoxylin and eosin, to visualize nuclei and cytoplasm, and with an anti-oligonucleotide rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin- ISIS 116847 conjugate in order to assess oligonucleotide staining patterns. Hematoxylin and eosin staining in most tissues exhibited no significant difference between saline- and oligonucleotide-treated animals. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies were recognized using an isospecific anti-IgG2 horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Zymed, San Francisco, CA) and immunostaining was developed with 3,3'-diaminobenzidene (DAKO, Carpenteria, CA). The results demonstrated that mice treated with the chemically modified siRNA 398249/398262, have significant increased liver accumulation of the siRNA as compared to the unmodified control, 341401/341391. 398249/398262 has also shown increased liver accumulation as compared to the other two chemically modified siRNAs, 398239/398256 and 398249/398256, and the MOE gapmer control 116847.\n\n\nThe PTEN protein levels were also determined for by Western blot analysis (immunoblot analysis) using standard methods. Liver samples from the treated mice were homogenized and diluted in Laemmli buffer (100 ul/well), boiled for 5 minutes and and equal amounts of protein were loaded on a 10-16% SDS-PAGE gel. Gels are run for 1-2 hours at 100-150 V, and transferred to membrane for western blotting. Appropriate primary antibody directed to PTEN (anti-rabbit IgG; HRP-conjugated from Upstate, cat # 07-016; lot # 26560) is used, and detected with an enzyme-linked secondary antibody (Goat anti-rabbit IgG; HRP-conjugted from Upstate, cat # 12-348; lot # 32628) directed against the primary antibody species. Bands are visualized/quantified using an Image Quank, version 5.2 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale Calif.).\n\n\nThe protein levels were decreased by 24-fold, 7-fold and 2.8-fold with treatment of 116847, 398249/398262 and 398239/398256 respectively. The mean values for the protein levels correlated with the measured mRNA levels. Various modifications of the invention, in addition to those described herein, will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description. Such modifications are also intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. Each reference (including, but not limited to, journal articles, U.S. and non-U.S. patents, patent application publications, \n\n international patent application publications, gene bank accession numbers, and the like) cited in the present application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety."

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to the derivatives of 3,6-disubstituted azabicyclo[3.1.0] hexanes. The compounds of this invention can function as muscarinic receptor antagonists, and can be used for the treatment of various diseases of the respiratory, urinary and gastrointestinal systems mediated through muscarinic receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds of the present invention and the methods of treating the diseases mediated through muscarinic receptors.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMuscarinic receptors as members of the G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are composed of a family of 5 receptor sub-types (M\n1\n, M\n2\n, M\n3\n, M\n4\n and M\n5\n) and are activated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. These receptors are widely distributed on multiple organs and tissues and are critical to the maintenance of central and peripheral cholinergic neurotransmission. The regional distribution of these receptor sub-types in the brain and other organs has been documented. For example, the M\n1\n subtype is located primarily in neuronal tissues such as cereberal cortex and autonomic ganglia, the M\n2\n subtype is present mainly in the heart where it mediates cholinergically induced bradycardia, and the M\n3\n subtype is located predominantly on smooth muscle and salivary glands (\nNature, 1986; 323: 411\n; \nScience, 1987; 237: 527\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA review in \nCurrent Opinions in Chemical Biology, 1999; 3: 426\n, as well as in \nTrends in Pharmacological Sciences, 2001; 22: 409 by Eglen et. al\n., describe the biological potentials of modulating muscarinic receptor subtypes by ligands in different disease conditions like Alzheimer's disease, pain, urinary disease condition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA review in \nJ. Med. Chem., 2000; 43: 4333 by Christian C. Felder et. al\n. describes therapeutic opportunities for muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system and elaborates on muscarinic receptor structure and function, pharmacology and their therapeutic uses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacological and medical aspects of the muscarinic class of acetylcholine agonists and antagonists are presented in a review in\n Molecules, 2001, 6: 142\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nN.J.M. Birdsall et. al. in Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 2001; 22: 215 \n have also summarized the recent developments on the role of different muscarinic receptor subtypes using different muscaranic receptors of knock out mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscarinic agonists such as muscarine and pilocarpine and antagonists such as atropine have been known for over a century, but little progress has been made in the discovery of receptor subtype-selective compounds making it difficult to assign specific functions to the individual receptors. Although classical muscarinic antagonists such as atropine are potent bronchodilators, their clinical utility is limited due to high incidence of both peripheral and central adverse effects such as tachycardia, blurred vision, dryness of mouth, constipation, dementia, etc. Subsequent development of the quarterly derivatives of atropine such as ipratropium bromide are better tolerated than parenterally administered options but most of them are not ideal anti-cholinergic bronchodilators due to lack of selectivity for muscarinic receptor sub-types. The existing compounds offer limited therapeutic benefit due to their lack of selectivity resulting in dose limiting side-effects such as thirst, nausea, mydriasis and those associated with the heart such as tachycardia mediated by the M\n2\n receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAnnual Review of Pharmacological Toxicol., 2001; 41: 691\n, describes the pharmacology of the lower urinary tract infections. Although anti muscarinic agents such as oxybutynin and tolterodine that act non-selectively on muscarinic receptors have been used for many years to treat bladder hyperactivity, the clinical effectiveness of these agents has been limited due to the side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision and constipation. Tolterodine is considered to be generally better tolerated than oxybutynin. (\nW.D.Steers et. al. in Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 2: 268\n, \nC.R.

The value of inhibition constant Ki was calculated from competitive binding studies by using Cheng & Prusoff equation \n(\n \nBiochem Pharmacol, 1973,22: 3099-3108\n \n),\n Ki = IC\n50\n /(1+L/Kd), where L is the concentration of [\n3\nH]NMS used in the particular experiment.\n\n\n \n\n\nFunctional Experiments using isolated rat bladder:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodology:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAnimals were euthanized by overdose of urethane and whole bladder was isolated and removed rapidly and placed in ice cold Tyrode buffer with the following composition (mMoI/L) NaCl 137; KCI 2.7; CaCl\n2\n 1.8; MgCl\n2\n 0.1; NaHCO\n3\n 11.9; NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n 0.4; Glucose 5.55 and continuously gassed with 95% O\n2\n and 5 % CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe bladder was cut into longitudinal strips (3mm wide and 5-6 mm long) and mounted in 10 ml organ baths at 30° C, with one end connected to the base of the tissue holder and the other end connected to a polygraph through a force displacement transducer. Each tissue was maintained at a constant basal tension of 2 g and allowed to equilibrate for 1 hour during which the PSS was changed every 15 min. At the end of equilibration period, the stabilization of the tissue contractile response was assessed with 1µMol/L of Carbachol consecutively for 2-3 times. Subsequently, a cumulative concentration response curve to carbachol (10\n-9\n mol/L to 3 X 10\n-5\n mol/L) was obtained. After several washes, once the baseline was achieved, cumulative concentration response curve was obtained in the presence of NCE (NCE added 20 min. prior to the second CRC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe contractile results were expressed as % of control E max. ED50 values were calculated by fitting a non-linear regression curve (Graph Pad Prism). pKB values were calculated by the formula pKB = - log [ (molar concentration of antagonist/(dose ratio-1))]\n\nwhere,\n\ndose ratio = ED50 in the presence of antagonist/ED50 in the absence of antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are listed in Tables II, III and IV.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIn -Vitro tests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nReceptor Binding Assay Ki (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctional Assay K\nB\n (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n3\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelectivity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound No.22\n\n\n2263\n\n\n94\n\n\n24.07\n\n\n27.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound No.41\n\n\n2944\n\n\n47\n\n\n62.64\n\n\n32.35\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound No.65\n\n\n1370\n\n\n33\n\n\n41.52\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound No.66\n\n\n237\n\n\n18.4\n\n\n12.88\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound No. 81\n\n\n564\n\n\n12.4\n\n\n45.48\n\n\n7.95\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound No. 82\n\n\n645.7\n\n\n11.74\n\n\n5\n\n\n9.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTolterodine\n\n\n6.91\n\n\n7.07\n\n\n0.98\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOxybutynin\n\n\n6.97\n\n\n0.95\n\n\n7.34\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtropine\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.83\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable III\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound No.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n3\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRat Bladder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nKi (nm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPki\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKi (nm)\n\n\n\n\n\n\npKi\n\n\n\n\n\n\npK\nB\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n94\n\n\n7.03\n\n\n2263\n\n\n5.65\n\n\n7.57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n530\n\n\n6.28\n\n\n> 1000\n\n\n< 6\n\n\n5.64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n490\n\n\n6.31\n\n\n> 1000\n\n\n< 6\n\n\n5.42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n1700\n\n\n5.77\n\n\n> 1000\n\n\n< 6\n\n\n6.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n150\n\n\n6.82\n\n\n> 1000\n\n\n< 6\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n97\n\n\n7.01\n\n\n> 1000\n\n\n< 6\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n833\n\n\n6.08\n\n\n> 0000\n\n\n<5\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n233\n\n\n6.63.\n\n\n1592\n\n\n5.8\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n429\n\n\n6.37\n\n\n1179\n\n\n< 6\n\n\n7.61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\n1560\n\n\n5.81\n\n\n> 1000\n\n\n< 6\n\n\n6.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n\n47\n\n\n7.33\n\n\n2944\n\n\n5.53\n\n\n7.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n55\n\n\n7.25\n\n\n2197\n\n\n5.66\n\n\n7.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n\n1000\n\n\n6.00\n\n\n> 1000\n\n\n< 6\n\n\n6.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n1200\n\n\n5.92\n\n\n> 1000\n\n\n< 6\n\n\n6.86\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\n370\n\n\n6.43\n\n\n> 1000\n\n\n< 6\n\n\n5.51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n\n380\n\n\n6.42\n\n\n> 1000\n\n\n< 6\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n57\n\n\n240\n\n\n6.62\n\n\n> 1000\n\n\n< 6\n\n\n5.73\n\n\n\n\n\n\n64\n\n\n68\n\n\n7.2\n\n\n2995\n\n\n5.6\n\n\n7.56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n65\n\n\n33\n\n\n7.53\n\n\n1370\n\n\n5.87\n\n\n8.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n66\n\n\n18.43\n\n\n7.81\n\n\n181.8\n\n\n6.94\n\n\n8.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n67\n\n\n39\n\n\n7.41\n\n\n1424\n\n\n5.85\n\n\n7.42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n\n108\n\n\n6.97\n\n\n> 1000\n\n\n< 6\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n\n1416\n\n\n5.85\n\n\n> 10000\n\n\n< 5\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n70\n\n\n750\n\n\n6.12\n\n\n> 10000\n\n\n< 5\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n72\n\n\n21\n\n\n7.68\n\n\n1531\n\n\n5.82\n\n\n7.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n81\n\n\n12.4\n\n\n7.94\n\n\n564\n\n\n6.28\n\n\n7.95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n82\n\n\n11.74\n\n\n7.93\n\n\n645.7\n\n\n6.19\n\n\n9.12\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTolterodine\n\n\n7.07\n\n\n8.15\n\n\n6.91\n\n\n8.16\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAltropine\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n9.6\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n9\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable IV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound No.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceptor Binding Assay (pKi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nM\n3\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n85\n\n\n<6\n\n\n<6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n86\n\n\n<6\n\n\n<6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n87\n\n\n<6\n\n\n<6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n88\n\n\n<6\n\n\n<6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n89\n\n\n<6\n\n\n<6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n90\n\n\n<6\n\n\n6.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n91\n\n\n4\n\n\n5.56\n\n\n\n\n\n\n92\n\n\n<5\n\n\n<5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n93\n\n\n<6\n\n\n<6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n94\n\n\n<6\n\n\n<6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n95\n\n\n<6\n\n\n<6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n96\n\n\n<6\n\n\n<6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n97\n\n\n<6\n\n\n<6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n98\n\n\n<6\n\n\n<6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTolterodine\n\n\n8.30\n\n\n8.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the present invention has been described in terms of its specific embodiments, certain modifications and equivalents will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention."
