Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel hepatitis C virus (\"HCV\") protease inhibitors, pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more such inhibitors, methods of preparing such inhibitors and methods of using such inhibitors to treat hepatitis C and related disorders. This invention additionally discloses novel compounds containing acylsulfonamide P1' moieties as inhibitors of the HCV NS3/NS4a serine protease. This application claims priority from \n \nU.S. provisional patent application Serial Number 60/605,234, filed August 27, 2004\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHepatitis C virus (HCV) is a (+)-sense single-stranded RNA virus that has been implicated as the major causative agent in non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH), particularly in blood-associated NANBH (BB-NANBH) (see, International Patent Application Publication No. \n \nWO 89/04669\n \n and European Patent Application Publication No. \n \nEP 381 216\n \n). NANBH is to be distinguished from other types of viral-induced liver disease, such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), delta hepatitis virus (HDV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), as well as from other forms of liver disease such as alcoholism and primary biliar cirrhosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, an HCV protease necessary for polypeptide processing and viral replication has been identified, cloned and expressed. (See, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,712,145\n \n). This approximately 3000 amino acid polyprotein contains, from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus, a nucleocapsid protein (C), envelope proteins (E1 and E2) and several non-structural proteins (NS1, 2, 3, 4a, 5a and 5b). NS3 is an approximately 68 kda protein, encoded by approximately 1893 nucleotides of the HCV genome, and has two distinct domains: (a) a serine protease domain consisting of approximately 200 of the N-terminal amino acids; and (b) an RNA-dependent ATPase domain at the C-terminus of the protein. The NS3 protease is considered a member of the chymotrypsin family because of similarities in protein sequence, overall three-dimensional structure and mechanism of catalysis. Other chymotrypsin-like enzymes are elastase, factor Xa, thrombin, trypsin, plasmin, urokinase, tPA and PSA. The HCV NS3 serine protease is responsible for proteolysis of the polypeptide (polyprotein) at the NS3/NS4a, NS4a/NS4b, NS4b/NS5a and NS5a/NS5b junctions and is thus responsible for generating four viral proteins during viral replication. This has made the HCV NS3 serine protease an attractive target for antiviral chemotherapy. The inventive compounds can inhibit such protease. They also can modulate the processing of hepatitis C virus (HCV) polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been determined that the NS4a protein, an approximately 6 kda polypeptide, is a co-factor for the serine protease activity of NS3. Autocleavage of the NS3/NS4a junction by the NS3/NS4a serine protease occurs intramolecularly (\ni.e\n., \ncis)\n while the other cleavage sites are processed intermolecularly (\ni.e\n., \ntrans).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis of the natural cleavage sites for HCV protease revealed the presence of cysteine at P1 and serine at P1' and that these residues are strictly conserved in the NS4a/NS4b, NS4b/NS5a and NS5a/NS5b junctions. The NS3/NS4a junction contains a threonine at P1 and a serine at P1'. The Cys→Thr substitution at NS3/NS4a is postulated to account for the requirement of \ncis\n rather than \ntrans\n processing at this junction. See, \ne.g.,\n \nPizzi et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci (USA) 91:888-892\n, \nFailla et al. (1996) Folding & Design 1:35-42\n. The NS3/NS4a cleavage site is also more tolerant of mutagenesis than the other sites. \nSee\n, \ne.g.\n, \nKollykhalov et al. (1994) J. Virol. 68:7525-7533\n \n.\n It has also been found that acidic residues in the region upstream of the cleavage site are required for efficient cleavage. See, \ne.g.\n, \nKomoda et al. (1994) J. Virol. 68:7351-7357\n \n.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibitors of HCV protease that have been reported include antioxidants (see, international Patent Application Publication No. \n \nWO 98/14181\n \n), certain peptides and peptide analogs (\nsee\n, International Patent Application Publication No. \n \nWO 98/17679\n \n, \nLandro et al.

Lett. 8:1713-1718\n), inhibitors based on the 70-amino acid polypeptide eglin c (\nMartin et al.

Hepat. 27:42-28\n). A ribozyme designed to selectively destroy hepatitis C virus RNA has recently been disclosed \n(see,\n \nBioWorld Today 9(217): 4 (November 10, 1998\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference is also made to the \n \nPCT Publications, No. WO 98/17679, published April 30, 1998\n \n (Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated); \n \nWO 98/22496, published May 28, 1998\n \n (F.

The prognosis for patients suffering from HCV infection is currently poor. HCV infection is more difficult to treat than other forms of hepatitis due to the lack of immunity or remission associated with HCV infection. Current data indicates a less than 50% survival rate at four years post cirrhosis diagnosis. Patients diagnosed with localized resectable hepatocellular carcinoma have a five-year survival rate of 10-30%, whereas those with localized unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma have a five-year survival rate of less than 1%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference is made to \n \nWO 00/59929\n \n (\n \nUS 6,608,027\n \n, Assignee: Boehringer Ingelheim (Canada) Ltd.; Published October 12, 2000) which discloses peptide derivatives of the formula:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference is made to \nA.

Greene et al, Protective Groups in organic Synthesis (1991), Wiley, New York\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen any variable (e.g., aryl, heterocycle, R\n2\n, etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent or in Formula I, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"composition\" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere used in naming the compounds of the present invention, the designations \"P1', P1, P2, P3, P4\" and the like, as used herein, map the relative positions of the amino acid residues of a protease inhibitor binding relative to the binding of the natural peptide cleavage substrate. Cleavage occurs in the natural substrate between P1 and P1' where the nonprime positions designate amino acids starting from the C-terminus end of the peptide natural cleavage site extending towards the N-terminus; whereas, the prime positions emanate from the N-terminus end of the cleavage site designation and extend towards the C-terminus. For example, P1' refers to the first position away from the right hand end of the C-terminus of the cleavage site (i.e., N-terminus first position); whereas P1 starts the numbering from the left hand side of the C-terminus cleavage site, P2: second position from the C-terminus, etc. See, \nA. Berger et al, Transactions of the Royal Society London Series, B250, 249-264 (1970\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrugs and solvates of the compounds of the invention are also contemplated herein. A discussion of prodrugs is provided in \nT. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems (1987) 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series\n, and in \nBioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, (1987) Edward B. Roche, ed., American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press\n. The term \"prodrug\" means a compound (e.g, a drug precursor) that is transformed \nin vivo\n to yield a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound. The transformation may occur by various mechanisms (e.g., by metabolic or chemical processes), such as, for example, through hydrolysis in blood. A discussion of the use of prodrugs is provided by \nT. Higuchi and W. Stella, \"\nPro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,\n\" Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series\n, and in \nBioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, if a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group, a prodrug can comprise an ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as, for example, (C\n1\n-C\n8\n)alkyl, (C\n2\n-C\n12\n)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-(alkanoyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkanoyloxy)-ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, 1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, N-(alkoxycarbonyl)aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, 1-(N-(alkoxycarbonyl)amino)ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, 3-phthalidyl, 4-crotonolactonyl, gamma-butyrolacton-4-yl, di-N,N-(C\n1\n-C\n2\n)alkylamino(C\n2\n-C\n3\n)alkyl (such as β-dimethylaminoethyl), carbamoyl-(C\n1\n-C\n2\n)alkyl, N,N-di (C\n1\n-C\n2\n)alkylcarbamoyl-(C1-C2)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidino- or morpholino(C\n2\n-C\n3\n)alkyl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, if a compound of Formula (I) contains an alcohol functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as, for example, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-((C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, 1-methyl-1-((C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl, N-(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl, succinoyl, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyl, α-amino(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkanyl, arylacyl and α-aminoacyl, or α-aminoacyl-α-aminoacyl, where each α-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH)\n2\n, -P(O)(O(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl)\n2\n or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate), and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a compound of Formula (I) incorporates an amine functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as, for example, R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl, NRR'-carbonyl where R and R' are each independently (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkyl, (C\n3\n-C\n7\n) cycloalkyl, benzyl, or R-carbonyl is a natural α-aminoacyl or natural α-aminoacyl, -C(OH)C(O)OY\n1\n wherein Y\n1\n is H, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl or benzyl, -C(OY\n2\n)Y\n3\n wherein Y\n2\n is (C\n1\n-C\n4\n) alkyl and Y\n3\n is (C\n1\n-C\n8\n)alkyl, carboxy (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, amino(C\n1\n-C\n4\n)alkyl or mono-N-or di-N,N-(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkylaminoalkyl, -C(Y\n4\n)Y\n5\n wherein Y\n4\n is H or methyl and Y\n5\n is mono-N- or di-N,N-(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkylamino morpholino, piperidin-1-yl or pyrrolidin-1-yl, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more compounds of the invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms. \"Solvate\" means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. \"Solvate\" encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. Non-limiting examples of suitable solvates include ethanolates, methanolates, and the like. \"Hydrate\" is a solvate wherein the solvent molecule is H\n2\nO.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne or more compounds of the invention may optionally be converted to a solvate. Preparation of solvates is generally known. Thus, for example, \nM. Caira et al, J. Pharmaceutical Sci., 93(3), 601-611 (2004\n) describe the preparation of the solvates of the antifungal fluconazole in ethyl acetate as well as from water. Similar preparations of solvates, hemisolvate, hydrates and the like are described by \nE. C. van Tonder et al, AAPS PharmSciTech., 5(1), article 12 (2004\n); and \nA. L. Bingham et al, Chem. Commun., 603-604 (2001\n). A typical, non-limiting, process involves dissolving the inventive compound in desired amounts of the desired solvent (organic or water or mixtures thereof) at a higher than ambient temperature, and cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals which are then isolated by standard methods. Analytical techniques such as, for example I. R. spectroscopy, show the presence of the solvent (or water) in the crystals as a solvate (or hydrate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Effective amount\" or \"therapeutically effective amount\" is meant to describe an amount of compound or a composition of the present invention effective in inhibiting the above-noted diseases and thus producing the desired therapeutic, ameliorative, inhibitory or preventative effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula I or II can form salts which are also within the scope of this invention. Reference to a compound of Formula I or II herein is understood to include reference to salts thereof, unless otherwise indicated. The term \"salt(s)\", as employed herein, denotes acidic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids, as well as basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic bases. In addition, when a compound of Formula I or II contains both a basic moiety, such as, but not limited to a pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety, such as, but not limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions (\"inner salts\") may be formed and are included within the term \"salt(s)\" as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful. Salts of the compounds of the Formula I or II may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of Formula I or II with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary acid addition salts include acetates, ascorbates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates, fumarates, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, hydroiodides, lactates, maleates, methanesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates, nitrates, oxalates, phosphates, propionates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates, tartarates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates (also known as tosylates,) and the like. Additionally, acids which are generally considered suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically useful salts from basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, for example, by \nP. Stahl et al, Camille G. (eds.) Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts. Properties, Selection and Use. (2002) Zurich: Wiley-VCH\n; \nS. Berge et al, Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences (1977) 66(1) 1-19\n; \nP. Gould, International J. of Pharmaceutics (1986) 33 201-217\n; \nAnderson et al, The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry (1996), Academic Press, New York\n; and in \nThe Orange Book (Food & Drug Administration, Washington, D.C\n. on their website). These disclosures are incorporated herein by reference thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases (for example, organic amines) such as dicyclohexylamines, t-butyl amines, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quartemized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g. methyl, ethyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g. dimethyl, diethyl, and dibutyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g. decyl, lauryl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g. benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll such acid salts and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable esters of the present compounds include the following groups: (1) carboxylic acid esters obtained by esterification of the hydroxy groups, in which the non-carbonyl moiety of the carboxylic acid portion of the ester grouping is selected from straight or branched chain alkyl (for example, acetyl, n-propyl, t-butyl, or n-butyl), alkoxyalkyl (for example, methoxymethyl), aralkyl (for example, benzyl), aryloxyalkyl (for example, phenoxymethyl), aryl (for example, phenyl optionally substituted with, for example, halogen, C\n1-4\nalkyl, or C\n1-4\nalkoxy or amino); (2) sulfonate esters, such as alkyl- or aralkylsulfonyl (for example, methanesulfonyl); (3) amino acid esters (for example, L-valyl or L-isoleucyl); (4) phosphonate esters and (5) mono-, di- or triphosphate esters. The phosphate esters may be further esterified by, for example, a C\n1-20\n alcohol or reactive derivative thereof, or by a 2,3-di (C\n6-24\n)acyl glycerol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of Formula I or II, and salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs thereof, may exist in their tautomeric form (for example, as an amide or imino ether). All such tautomeric forms are contemplated herein as part of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula I or II may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and, therefore, exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I or II as well as mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. In addition, the present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example, if a compound of Formula I or II incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of Formula I or II may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of chiral HPLC column.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible that the compounds of Formula I or II may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are included in the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll stereoisomers (for example, geometric isomers, optical isomers and the like) of the present compounds (including those of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs of the compounds as well as the salts, solvates and esters of the prodrugs), such as those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on various substituents, including enantiomeric forms (which may exist even in the absence of asymmetric carbons), rotameric forms, atropisomers, and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention, as are positional isomers (such as, for example, 4-pyridyl and 3-pyridyl). Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may, for example, be substantially free of other isomers, or may be admixed, for example, as racemates or with all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention can have the S or R configuration as defined by the \nIUPAC\n 1974 Recommendations. The use of the terms \"salt\", \"solvate\", \"ester\", \"prodrug\" and the like, is intended to equally apply to the salt, solvate, ester and prodrug of enantiomers, stereoisomers, rotamers, tautomers, positional isomers, racemates or prodrugs of the inventive compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also embraces isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n16\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, and \n36\nCl, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula (I) (e.g., those labeled with \n3\nH and \n14\nC) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., \n3\nH) and carbon-14 (i.e., \n14\nC) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of Formula (I) can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples hereinbelow, by substituting an appropriate isotopically labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymorphic forms of the compounds of Formula I or II, and of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs of the compounds of Formula I or II, are intended to be included in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds according to the invention have pharmacological properties; in particular, the compounds of Formulas I and II can be inhibitors of HCV protease, each compound by itself or one or more compounds of Formula I or II can be combined with one or more compounds selected from within Formula I or II. The compound(s) can be useful for treating diseases such as, for example, HCV, HIV, (AIDS, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), and related disorders, as well as for modulating the activity of hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease, preventing HCV, or ameliorating one or more symptoms of hepatitis C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula I and II may be used for the manufacture of a medicament to treat disorders associated with the HCV protease, for example, the method comprising bringing into intimate contact a compound of Formula I and II and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, this invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the inventive compound or compounds as an active ingredient. The pharmaceutical compositions generally additionally comprise at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier diluent, excipient or carrier (collectively referred to herein as carrier materials). Because of their HCV inhibitory activity, such pharmaceutical compositions possess utility in treating hepatitis C and related disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the present invention discloses methods for preparing pharmaceutical compositions comprising the inventive compounds as an active ingredient. In the pharmaceutical compositions and methods of the present invention, the active ingredients will typically be administered in admixture with suitable carrier materials suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, i.e. oral tablets, capsules (either solid-filled, semi-solid filled or liquid filled), powders for constitution, oral gels, elixirs, dispersible granules, syrups, suspensions, and the like, and consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices. For example, for oral administration in the form of tablets or capsules, the active drug component may be combined with any oral non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier, such as lactose, starch, sucrose, cellulose, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, talc, mannitol, ethyl alcohol (liquid forms) and the like. Moreover, when desired or needed, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents may also be incorporated in the mixture. Powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 95 percent inventive composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars, com sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol and waxes. Among the lubricants there may be mentioned for use in these dosage forms, boric acid, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrants include starch, methylcellulose, guar gum and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSweetening and flavoring agents and preservatives may also be included where appropriate. Some of the terms noted above, namely disintegrants, diluents, lubricants, binders and the like, are discussed in more detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the compositions of the present invention may be formulated in sustained release form to provide the rate controlled release of any one or more of the components or active ingredients to optimize the therapeutic effects, i.e. HCV inhibitory activity and the like. Suitable dosage forms for sustained release include layered tablets containing layers of varying disintegration rates or controlled release polymeric matrices impregnated with the active components and shaped in tablet form or capsules containing such impregnated or encapsulated porous polymeric matrices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. As an example may be mentioned water or water-propylene glycol solutions for parenteral injections or addition of sweeteners and pacifiers for oral solutions, suspensions and emulsions. Liquid form preparations may also include solutions for intranasal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAerosol preparations suitable for inhalation may include solutions and solids in powder form, which may be in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as inert compressed gas, e.g. nitrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor preparing suppositories, a low melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides such as cocoa butter is first melted, and the active ingredient is dispersed homogeneously therein by stirring or similar mixing. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby solidify.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for either oral or parenteral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions may take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered orally, intravenously, intranasally or subcutaneously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also comprise preparations which are in a unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active components, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe quantity of the inventive active composition in a unit dose of preparation may be generally varied or adjusted from about 1.0 milligram to about 1,000 milligrams, preferably from about 1.0 to about 950 milligrams, more preferably from about 1.0 to about 500 milligrams, and typically from about 1 to about 250 milligrams, according to the particular application. The actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the patient's age, sex, weight and severity of the condition being treated. Such techniques are well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the human oral dosage form containing the active ingredients can be administered 1 or 2 times per day. The amount and frequency of the administration will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician. A generally recommended daily dosage regimen for oral administration may range from about 1.0 milligram to about 1,000 milligrams per day, in single or divided doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome useful terms are described below:\n\n \n \n \nCapsule - refers to a special container or enclosure made of methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohols, or denatured gelatins or starch for holding or containing compositions comprising the active ingredients. Hard shell capsules are typically made of blends of relatively high gel strength bone and pork skin gelatins. The capsule itself may contain small amounts of dyes, opaquing agents, plasticizers and preservatives.\n \nTablet- refers to a compressed or molded solid dosage form containing the active ingredients with suitable diluents. The tablet can be prepared by compression of mixtures or granulations obtained by wet granulation, dry granulation or by compaction.\n \nOral gel- refers to the active ingredients dispersed or solubilized in a hydrophillic semi-solid matrix.\n \nPowder for constitution refers to powder blends containing the active ingredients and suitable diluents which can be suspended in water or juices.\n \nDiluent - refers to substances that usually make up the major portion of the composition or dosage form. Suitable diluents include sugars such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol and sorbitol; starches derived from wheat, com, rice and potato; and celluloses such as microcrystalline cellulose. The amount of diluent in the composition can range from about 10 to about 90% by weight of the total composition, preferably from about 25 to about 75%, more preferably from about 30 to about 60% by weight, even more preferably from about 12 to about 60%.\n \nDisintegrant - refers to materials added to the composition to help it break apart (disintegrate) and release the medicaments. Suitable disintegrants include starches; \"cold water soluble\" modified starches such as sodium carboxymethyl starch; natural and synthetic gums such as locust bean, karaya, guar, tragacanth and agar; cellulose derivatives such as methylcellulose and sodium carboxymethylcellulose; microcrystalline celluloses and cross-linked microcrystalline celluloses such as sodium croscarmellose; alginates such as alginic acid and sodium alginate; clays such as bentonites; and effervescent mixtures. The amount of disintegrant in the composition can range from about 2 to about 15% by weight of the composition, more preferably from about 4 to about 10% by weight.\n \nBinder - refers to substances that bind or \"glue\" powders together and make them cohesive by forming granules, thus serving as the \"adhesive\" in the formulation. Binders add cohesive strength already available in the diluent or bulking agent. Suitable binders include sugars such as sucrose; starches derived from wheat, corn rice and potato; natural gums such as acacia, gelatin and tragacanth; derivatives of seaweed such as alginic acid, sodium alginate and ammonium calcium alginate; cellulosic materials such as methylcellulose and sodium carboxymethylcellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose; polyvinylpyrrolidone; and inorganics such as magnesium aluminum silicate. The amount of binder in the composition can range from about 2 to about 20% by weight of the composition, more preferably from about 3 to about 10% by weight, even more preferably from about 3 to about 6% by weight.\n \nLubricant - refers to a substance added to the dosage form to enable the tablet, granules, etc. after it has been compressed, to release from the mold or die by reducing friction or wear. Suitable lubricants include metallic stearates such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate or potassium stearate; stearic acid; high melting point waxes; and water soluble lubricants such as sodium chloride, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium oleate, polyethylene glycols and d'I-leucine. Lubricants are usually added at the very last step before compression, since they must be present on the surfaces of the granules and in between them and the parts of the tablet press. The amount of lubricant in the composition can range from about 0.2 to about 5% by weight of the composition, preferably from about 0.5 to about 2%, more preferably from about 0.3 to about 1.5% by weight.\n \nGlident - material that prevents caking and improve the flow characteristics of granulations, so that flow is smooth and uniform. Suitable glidents include silicon dioxide and talc. The amount of glident in the composition can range from about 0.1 % to about 5% by weight of the total composition, preferably from about 0.5 to about 2% by weight.\n \nColoring agents - excipients that provide coloration to the composition or the dosage form. Such excipients can include food grade dyes and food grade dyes adsorbed onto a suitable adsorbent such as clay or aluminum oxide. The amount of the coloring agent can vary from about 0.1 to about 5% by weight of the composition, preferably from about 0.1 to about 1%.\n \nBioavailability - refers to the rate and extent to which the active drug ingredient or therapeutic moiety is absorbed into the systemic circulation from an administered dosage form as compared to a standard or control.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nConventional methods for preparing tablets are known. Such methods include dry methods such as direct compression and compression of granulation produced by compaction, or wet methods or other special procedures. Conventional methods for making other forms for administration such as, for example, capsules, suppositories and the like are also well known.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the invention discloses the use of the inventive compounds or pharmaceutical compositions disclosed above for treatment of diseases such as, for example, hepatitis C and the like. The method comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of the inventive compound or pharmaceutical composition to a patient having such a disease or diseases and in need of such a treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the compounds of the invention may be used for the treatment of HCV in humans in monotherapy mode or in a combination therapy (e.g., dual combination, triple combination etc.) mode such as, for example, in combination with antiviral and/or immunomodulatory agents. Examples of such antiviral and/or immunomodulatory agents include Ribavirin (from Schering-Plough Corporation, Madison, New Jersey) and Levovirin\n™\n (from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, California), VP 50406\n™\n. (from Viropharma, Incorporated, Exton, Pennsylvania), ISIS 14803\n™\n (from ISIS Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, California), Heptazyme\n™\n (from Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals, Boulder, Colorado), VX 497\n™\n (from Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts), Thymosin\n™\n (from SciClone Pharmaceuticals, San Mateo, California), Maxamine\n™\n (Maxim Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, California), mycophenolate mofetil (from Hoffman-LaRoche, Nutley, New Jersey), interferon (such as, for example, interferon-alpha, PEG-interferon alpha conjugates) and the like. \"PEG-interferon alpha conjugates\" are interferon alpha molecules covalently attached to a PEG molecule. Illustrative PEG-interferon alpha conjugates include interferon alpha-2a (Roferon\n™\n, from Hoffman La-Roche, Nutley, New Jersey) in the form of pegylated interferon alpha-2a (e.g., as sold under the trade name Pegasys\n™\n), interferon alpha-2b (intron\n™\n, from Schering-Plough Corporation) in the form of pegylated interferon alpha-2b (e.g., as sold under the trade name PEG-intron\n™\n), interferon alpha-2c (Berofor Alpha\n™\n, from Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany) or consensus interferon as defined by determination of a consensus sequence of naturally occurring interferon alphas (Infergen\n™\n, from Amgen, Thousand Oaks, Califomia).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen administering a combination therapy to a patient in need of such administration, the therapeutic agents in the combination, or a pharmaceutical composition or compositions comprising the therapeutic agents, may be administered in any order such as, for example, sequentially, concurrently, simultaneously and the like. The amounts of the various actives in such combination therapy may be different amounts (dosage amounts) or same amounts (dosage amounts).The term \"pharmaceutical composition\" is also intended to encompass both the bulk composition and individual dosage units comprised of more than one (e.g., two) pharmaceutically active agents such as, for example, a compound of the present invention and an additional agent selected from the lists of the additional agents described herein, along with any pharmaceutically inactive excipients. The bulk composition and each individual dosage unit can contain fixed amounts of the afore-said \"more than one pharmaceutically active agents\". The bulk composition is material that has not yet been formed into individual dosage units. An illustrative dosage unit is an oral dosage unit such as tablets, pills and the like. Similarly, the herein-described method of treating a patient by administering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is also intended to encompass the administration of the afore-said bulk composition and individual dosage units. Thus, for illustration purposes, a compound of Formula I and an antiviral agent may be present in fixed amounts (dosage amounts) in a single dosage unit (e.g., a capsule, a tablet and the like). A commercial example of such single dosage unit containing fixed amounts of two different active compounds is VYTORIN\n®\n (available from Merck Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals, Kenilworth, New Jersey).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs stated earlier, the invention includes tautomers, rotamers, enantiomers and other stereoisomers of the inventive compounds also. Thus, as one skilled in the art appreciates, some of the inventive compounds may exist in suitable isomeric forms. Such variations are contemplated to be within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother embodiment of the invention discloses a method of making the compounds disclosed herein. The compounds may be prepared by several techniques known in the art. Illustrative procedures are outlined in the following reaction schemes. The illustrations should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention which is defined in the appended claims. Alternative mechanistic pathways and analogous structures will be apparent to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is to be understood that while the following illustrative schemes describe the preparation of a few representative inventive compounds, suitable substitution of any of both the natural and unnatural amino acids will result in the formation of the desired compounds based on such substitution. Such variations are contemplated to be within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAbbreviations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAbbreviations which are used in the descriptions of the schemes, preparations and the examples that follow are:\n\n \n \n \nTHF: Tetrahydrofuran\n \nDMF: N,N-Dimethylformamide\n \nEtOAc: Ethyl acetate\n \nAcOH: Acetic acid\n \nHOOBt: 3-Hydroxy-1,2,3-benzotriazin-4(3H)-one\n \nEDCI: 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride\n \nNMM: N-Methylmorpholine\n \nADDP: 1,1'-(Azodicarbobyl)dipiperidine\n \nDEAD: Diethylazodicarboxylate\n \nMeOH: Methanol\n \nEtOH: Ethanol\n \nEt2O: Diethyl ether\n \nDMSO: Dimethylsulfoxide\n \nHOBt: N-Hydroxybenzotriazole\n \nPyBrOP: Bromo-tris-pyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate\n \nDCM: Dichloromethane\n \nDCC: 1,3-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide\n \nTEMPO: 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy\n \nPhg: Phenylglycine\n \nChg: Cyclohexylglycine\n \nBn: Benzyl\n \nBzl: Benzyl\n \nEt: Ethyl\n \nPh: Phenyl\n \niBoc: isobutoxycarbonyl\n \niPr: isopropyl\n \n \nt\nBu or Bu\nt\n: tert-Butyl\n \nBoc: tert-Butyloxycarbonyl\n \nCbz: Benzyloxycarbonyl\n \nCp: Cylcopentyldienyl\n \nTs: p-toluenesulfonyl\n \nMe: Methyl\n \nHATU: O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate\n \nDMAP: 4-N,N-Dimethylaminopyridine\n \nBOP : Benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethytamino)hexafluorophosphate\n \nPCC: Pyridiniumchlorochromate\n \nKHMDS: Potassium Hexamethyldisilazide or Potassium bis(trimethylsilylamide)\n \nNaHMDS: Sodium Hexamethyldisilazide or Sodium bis(trimethylsilylamide)\n \nLiHMDS: Lithium Hexamethyldisilazide or Lithium bis(trimethylsilylamide)\n \n10% Pd/C: 10% Palladium on carbon (by weight).\n \nTG: Thioglycerol\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation of Intermediate 1.01\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino ester \n1.01\n was prepared following the method of \nR.

This utility can be manifested in their ability to inhibit the HCV NS3/NS4a serine protease. A general procedure for such demonstration is illustrated by the following \nin vitro\n assay.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAssay for HCV Protease Inhibitory Activity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpectrophotometric Assay:\n Spectrophotometric assay for the HCV serine protease can be performed on the inventive compounds by following the procedure described by \nR. Zhang et al, Analytical Biochemistry, 270 (1999) 268-275\n, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The assay based on the proteolysis of chromogenic ester substrates is suitable for the continuous monitoring of HCV NS3 protease activity. The substrates are derived from the P side of the NS5A-NS5B junction sequence (Ac-DTEDWX(Nva), where X = A or P) whose C-terminal carboxyl groups are esterified with one of four different chromophoric alcohols (3- or 4-nitrophenol, 7-hydroxy-4-methyl-coumarin, or 4-phenylazophenol). Illustrated below are the synthesis, characterization and application of these novel spectrophotometric ester substrates to high throughput screening and detailed kinetic evaluation of HCV NS3 protease inhibitors.\n\n\n \n\n\nMaterials and Methods:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMaterials: Chemical reagents for assay related buffers are obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, Missouri). Reagents for peptide synthesis were from Aldrich Chemicals, Novabiochem (San Diego, California), Applied Biosystems (Foster City, California) and Perseptive Biosystems (Framingham, Massachusetts). Peptides are synthesized manually or on an automated ABI model 431 A synthesizer (from Applied Biosystems). UV/VIS Spectrometer model LAMBDA 12 was from Perkin Elmer (Norwalk, Connecticut) and 96-well UV plates were obtained from Coming (Coming, New York). The prewarming block can be from USA Scientific (Ocala, Florida) and the 96-well plate vortexer is from Labline Instruments (Melrose Park, Illinois). A Spectramax Plus microtiter plate reader with monochrometer is obtained from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, California).\n\n\nEnzyme Preparation:\n Recombinant heterodimeric HCV NS3/NS4A protease (strain 1 a) is prepared by using the procedures published previously (\nD. L. Sali et al, Biochemistry, 37 (1998) 3392-3401\n). Protein concentrations are determined by the Biorad dye method using recombinant HCV protease standards previously quantified by amino acid analysis. Prior to assay initiation, the enzyme storage buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% lauryl maltoside and 10 mM DTT) is exchanged for the assay buffer (25 mM MOPS pH 6.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% lauryl maltoside, 5 µM EDTA and 5 µM DTT) utilizing a Biorad Bio-Spin P-6 prepacked column.\n\n\nSubstrate Synthesis and Purification:\n The synthesis of the substrates is done as reported by R. Zhang \net al\n, (\nibid\n) and is initiated by anchoring Fmoc-Nva-OH to 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin using a standard protocol (\nK. Barlos et al, Int. J. Pept. Protein Res., 37 (1991), 513-520\n). The peptides are subsequently assembled, using Fmoc chemistry, either manually or on an automatic ABI model 431 peptide synthesizer. The N-acetylated and fully protected peptide fragments are cleaved from the resin either by 10% acetic acid (HOAc) and 10% trifluoroethanol (TFE) in dichloromethane (DCM) for 30 min, or by 2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in DCM for 10 min. The combined filtrate and DCM wash is evaporated azeotropically (or repeatedly extracted by aqueous Na\n2\nCO\n3\n solution) to remove the acid used in cleavage. The DCM phase is dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n and evaporated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ester substrates are assembled using standard acid-alcohol coupling procedures (\nK. Holmber et al, Acta Chem. Scand., B33 (1979) 410-412\n). Peptide fragments are dissolved in anhydrous pyridine (30-60 mg/ml) to which 10 molar equivalents of chromophore and a catalytic amount (0.1 eq.) of para-toluenesulfonic acid (pTSA) were added. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 3 eq.) is added to initiate the coupling reactions. Product formation is monitored by HPLC and can be found to be complete following 12-72 hour reaction at room temperature. Pyridine solvent is evaporated under vacuum and further removed by azeotropic evaporation with toluene. The peptide ester is deprotected with 95% TFA in DCM for two hours and extracted three times with anhydrous ethyl ether to remove excess chromophore. The deprotected substrate is purified by reversed phase HPLC on a C3 or C8 column with a 30% to 60% acetonitrile gradient (using six column volumes). The overall yield following HPLC purification can be approximately 20-30%. The molecular mass can be confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy. The substrates are stored in dry powder form under desiccation.\n\n\nSpectra of Substrates and Products\n: Spectra of substrates and the corresponding chromophore products are obtained in the pH 6.5 assay buffer. Extinction coefficients are determined at the optimal off-peak wavelength in 1-cm cuvettes (340 nm for 3-Np and HMC, 370 nm for PAP and 400 nm for 4-Np) using multiple dilutions. The optimal off-peak wavelength is defined as that wavelength yielding the maximum fractional difference in absorbance between substrate and product (product OD - substrate OD)/substrate OD). \nProtease Assay:\n HCV protease assays are performed at 30°C using a 200 µl reaction mix in a 96-well microtiter plate. Assay buffer conditions (25 mM MOPS pH 6.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% lauryl maltoside, 5 µM EDTA and 5 µM DTT) are optimized for the NS3/NS4A heterodimer (D. L. Sali \net al, ibid\n.)). Typically, 150 µl mixtures of buffer, substrate and inhibitor are placed in wells (final concentration of DMSO ≤ 4 % v/v) and allowed to preincubate at 30 °C for approximately 3 minutes. Fifty µls of prewarmed protease (12 nM, 30°C) in assay buffer, is then used to initiate the reaction (final volume 200 µl).The plates are monitored over the length of the assay (60 minutes) for change in absorbance at the appropriate wavelength (340 nm for 3-Np and HMC, 370 nm for PAP, and 400 nm for 4-Np) using a Spectromax Plus microtiter plate reader equipped with a monochrometer (acceptable results can be obtained with plate readers that utilize cutoff filters). Proteolytic cleavage of the ester linkage between the Nva and the chromophore is monitored at the appropriate wavelength against a no enzyme blank as a control for non-enzymatic hydrolysis. The evaluation of substrate kinetic parameters is performed over a 30-fold substrate concentration range (-6-200 µM). Initial velocities are determined using linear regression and kinetic constants are obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using non-linear regression analysis (Mac Curve Fit 1.1, K. Raner). Turnover numbers (\nk\n \ncat\n) are calculated assuming the enzyme is fully active. \nEvaluation of Inhibitors and Inactivators:\n The inhibition constants (K\ni\n) for the competitive inhibitors Ac-D-(D-Gla)-L-I-(Cha)-C-OH (27), Ac-DTEDWA(Nva)-OH and Ac-DTEDWP(Nva)-OH are determined experimentally at fixed concentrations of enzyme and substrate by plotting v\no\n/v\ni\n vs. inhibitor concentration ([I]\no\n) according to the rearranged Michaelis-Menten equation for competitive inhibition kinetics: v\no\n/v\ni\n =1 + [I]\no\n/(K\ni\n (1 + [S]\no\n/K\nm\n)), where v\no\n is the uninhibited initial velocity, v\ni\n is the initial velocity in the presence of inhibitor at any given inhibitor concentration ([I]\no\n) and [S]\no\n is the substrate concentration used. The resulting data are fitted using linear regression and the resulting slope, 1/(K\ni\n(1+[S]\no\n/K\nm\n), is used to calculate the K\ni\n value. The obtained Ki* values (in nanoMolar) for some of the inventive compounds are shown below in \n \nTable 2\n \n.\n\n \n \nTable 2\n \n \n \n \nCompound structure\n \nKi (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the present invention has been described with In conjunction with the specific embodiments set forth above, many alternatives, modifications and other variations thereof will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art."

Specifically, the compounds of this invention are also useful in the treatment of various CNS disorders, hematological disorders, eating disorders, diseases associated with pain, respiratory diseases, genito-urological disorders, cardiovascular diseases and cancer.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nVarious central nervous system disorders such as anxiety, depression, motor disorders etc., are believed to involve a disturbance of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin. Serotonin is localized in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is known to affect many types of conditions including psychiatric disorders, motor activity, feeding behavior, sexual activity and neuroendocrine regulation among others. 5-HT receptor subtypes regulate the various effects of serotonin. Known 5-HT receptor family includes the 5-HT\n1\n family (e.g. 5-HT\n1A\n), the 5-HT\n2\n family (e.g.5- HT\n2A\n)\n,\n 5-HT\n3\n, 5-HT\n4\n, 5-HT\n5\n, 5-HT\n6\n and 5-HT\n7\n subtypes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO 2007/020652\n \n discloses aminoaryl sulphonamide derivatives which are useful in the treatment of CNS disorders related to or affected by the 5-HTg receptor\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 5-HT\n6\n receptor subtype was first cloned from rat tissue in 1993 (\nMonsma, F. J.; Shen, Y.; Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W., Sibley, D.R., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327\n) and subsequently from human tissue (\nKohen, R.; Metcalf, M. A.; Khan, N.; Druck, T.; Huebner, K.; Sibley, D. R., Journal of Neurochemistry, 1996, 66, 47-56\n). The receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) positively coupled to adenylate cyclase (\nRuat, M.; Traiffort, E.; Arrang, J-M.; Tardivel-Lacombe, L.; Diaz, L.; Leurs, R.; Schwartz, J-C., Biochemical Biophysical Research Communications, 1993, 193, 268-276\n). The receptor is found almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS) areas both in rats as well as in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn situ hybridization studies of 5-HT\n6\n receptor in rat brain using mRNA indicate principal localization in the areas of 5-HT projection including striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and hippocampal formation (\nWard, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W.; Lachowicz, J. E.; Hoffman, B. J.; Sibley, D. R.; Dorsa, D. M., Neuroscience, 1995, 64, 1105-1111\n). Highest levels of 5-HT\n6\n receptor mRNA has been observed in the olfactory tubercle, the striatum, nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus as well as CA\n1\n, CA\n2\n and CA\n3\n regions of the hippocampus. Lower levels of 5-HT\n6\n receptor mRNA were seen in the granular layer of the cerebellum, several diencephalic nuclei, amygdala and in the cortex. Northern blots have revealed that 5-HT\n6\n receptor mRNA appears to be exclusively present in the brain, with little evidence for its presence in peripheral tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe high affinity of number of antipsychotic agents towards 5-HT\n6\n receptor, the localization of its mRNA in striatum, olfactory tubercle and nucleus accumbens suggests that some of the clinical actions of these compounds may be mediated through this receptor. Its ability to bind a wide range of therapeutic compounds used in psychiatry, coupled with its intriguing distribution in the brain has stimulated significant interest in new compounds which are capable of interacting with the said receptor (Ref: \nSleight, A.J. et al. (1997) 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors: molecular biology, functional correlates and possible therapeutic indications, Drug News Perspect. 10, 214-224\n). Significant efforts are being made to understand the possible role of the 5-HT\n6\n receptor in psychiatry, cognitive dysfunction, motor function and control, memory, mood and the like. The compounds which demonstrate a binding affinity for the 5-HT\n6\n receptor are earnestly sought both as an aid in the study of the 5-HT\n6\n receptor and as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of central nervous system disorders, for example see \nReavill C. and Rogers D. C., Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2001, 2(1): 104-109, Pharma Press Ltd.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonsma F.J. et al. (1993) and Kohen, R. et al. (2001) have shown that several tricyclic antidepressant compounds, such as amitriptyline and atypical antidepressant compounds, such as mianserin have high affinity for the 5-HT\n6\n receptor. These findings have led to the hypothesis that the 5-HT\n6\n receptor is involved in the pathogenesis and/or treatment of affective disorders. Rodent models of anxiety-related behavior yield conflicting results about the role of the 5-HT\n6\n receptor in anxiety. Treatment with 5-HT\n6\n receptor antagonists increases seizure threshold in a rat maximal electroconvulsive-shock test [\nStean, T. et al. (1999) Anticonvulsant properties of the selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist SB-271046 in the rat maximal electroshock seizure threshold test. Br. J. Pharmacol. 127, 131P\n; \nRoutledge, C. et al. (2000) Characterization of SB-271046: a potent, selective and orally active 5-HT6) receptor antagonist. Br. J. Pharmacol. 130, 1606-1612\n]. Although this indicates that 5-HT\n6\n receptors might regulate seizure threshold, the effect is not as pronounced as that of known anticonvulsant drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOur understanding of the roles of 5-HT\n6\n receptor ligands is most advanced in two therapeutic indications in which this receptor is likely to have a major role: learning and memory deficits and abnormal feeding behaviour. The exact role of the 5-HT\n6\n receptor is yet to be established in other CNS indications such as anxiety; although one 5-HT\n6\n agonist has reached Phase I clinical trials recently, the exact role of the receptor is still to be established and is the focus of significant investigation. There are many potential therapeutic uses for 5-HT\n6\n receptor ligands in humans based on direct effects and on indications from available scientific studies. These studies include the localization of the receptor, the affinity of ligands with known in-vivo activity and various animal studies conducted so far. Preferably, antagonist compounds of 5-HT\n6\n receptors are sought after as therapeutic agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne potential therapeutic use of modulators of 5-HT\n6\n receptor functions is in the enhancement of cognition and memory in human diseases such as Alzheimer's. The high levels of receptor found in structures such as the forebrain, including the caudate/putamen, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and cortex suggests a role for the receptor in memory and cognition since these areas are known to play a vital role in memory (\nGerard, C.; Martres, M.P.; Lefevre, K.; Miquel, M. C.; Verge, D.; Lanfumey, R.; Doucet, E.; Hamon, M.; EI Mestikawy, S., Brain Research, 1997, 746, 207-219\n). The ability of known 5-HT\n6\n receptor ligands to enhance cholinergic transmission also supports the potential cognition use (\nBentey, J. C.; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStudies have found that a known 5-HT\n6\n selective antagonist significantly increased glutamate and aspartate levels in the frontal cortex without elevating levels of noradrenaline, dopamine or 5-HT. This selective elevation of certain neurochemicals is noted during memory and cognition, strongly suggests a role for 5-HT\n6\n ligands in cognition (\nDawson, L. A.; Nguyen, H. Q.; Li, P. British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 130 (1), 23-26\n). Animal studies of memory and learning with a known selective 5-HT\n6\n antagonist has some positive effects (\nRogers, D. C.; Hatcher, P. D.; Hagan, J. J. Society of Neuroscience, Abstract, 2000, 26, 680\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA related potential therapeutic use for 5-HT\n6\n ligands is in the treatment of attention deficit disorders (ADD, also known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD) in children as well as adults. As 5-HT\n6\n antagonists appear to enhance the activity of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and ADHD has been linked to abnormalities in the caudate (\nErnst, M; Zametkin, A. J.; Matochik, J. H.; Jons, P. A.; Cohen, R. M., Journal of Neuroscience, 1998, 18(15), 5901-5907\n), 5-HT\n6\n antagonists may attenuate attention deficit disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt present, a few fully selective agonists are available. The Wyeth agonist WAY-181187 is currently in Phase I trials to target anxiety [\nCole, D.C. et al. (2005) Discovery of a potent, selective and orally active 5-HT6 receptor agonist, WAY-181187. 230th ACS Natl. Meet. (Aug 28-Sept 1, Washington DC), Abstract MEDI 17\n.]\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternational Patent Publication \n \nWO 03/066056 A1\n \n reports that antagonism of 5-HT\n6\n receptor could promote neuronal growth within the central nervous system of a mammal. Another International Patent Publication \n \nWO 03/065046 A2\n \n discloses new variant of human 5-HT\n6\n receptor and proposes that 5-HT\n6\n receptor is associated with numerous other disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEarly studies examining the affinity of various CNS ligands with known therapeutic utility or a strong structural resemblance to known drugs suggests a role for 5-HT\n6\n ligands in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. For example, clozapine (an effective clinical antipsychotic) has high affinity for the 5-HT\n6\n receptor subtype. Also, several clinical antidepressants have high affinity for the receptor as well and act as antagonists at this site (\nBranchek, T. A.; Blackburn, T. P., Annual Reviews in Pharmacology and Toxicology, 2000, 40,319-334\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, recent \nin-vivo\n studies in rats indicate that 5-HT\n6\n modulators may be useful in the treatment of movement disorders including epilepsy (\nStean, T.; Routledge, C.; Upton, N., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 127 Proc. Supplement-131P\n; and \nRoutledge, C.; Bromidge, S. M.; Moss, S. F.; Price, G. W.; Hirst, W.; Newman, H.; Riley, G.; Gager, T.; Stean, T.; Upton, N.; Clarke, S. E.; Brown, A. M., British Journal of Pharmacology, 2000, 30 (7), 1606-1612\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together, the above studies strongly suggest that compounds which are 5-HT\n6\n receptor modulators, i.e. ligands, may be useful for therapeutic indications including, the treatment of diseases associated with a deficit in memory, cognition and learning such as Alzheimer's and attention deficit disorder; the treatment of personality disorders such as schizophrenia; the treatment of behavioral disorders, e.g. anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorders; the treatment of motion or motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy; the treatment of diseases associated with neurodegeneration such as stroke or head trauma; or withdrawal from drug addiction including addiction to nicotine, alcohol and other substances of abuse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder. See for example, \nRoth, B. L.; et al., Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, 1994, 268, pages 1403-1412\n; \nSibley, D. R.; et al., Molecular Pharmacology, 1993, 43, 320-327\n, \nSleight, A. J.; et al., Neurotransmission, 1995, 11, 1-5\n; and \nSleight; A. J.; et al., Serotonin ID Research Alert, 1997, 2(3),115-118\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the effect of 5-HT\n6\n antagonist and 5-HT\n6\n antisense oligonucleotides to reduce food intake in rats has been reported, thus potentially in treatment of obesity. See for example, \nBentey, J. C.; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J., British Journal of Pharmacology, 1999, 126 (7), 1537-1542\n); \nWooley et al., Neuropharmacology, 2001, 41: 210-129\n; and \n \nWO 02/098878\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently a review by \nHolenz, Jo\"rg et.al., Drug Discovery Today, 11, 7/8, April 2006\n, Medicinal chemistry strategies to 5-HT\n6\n receptor ligands as potential cognitive enhancers and antiobesity agents, gives elaborate discussion on evolution of 5-HT\n6\n ligands. It had summarized pharmacological tools and preclinical candidates used in evaluation of 5-HT\n6\n receptor in illnesses such as schizophrenia, other dopamine-related disorders and depression and to profile the neurochemical and electrophysiological effects of either blockade or activation of 5-HT\n6\n receptors. Furthermore, they have been used to characterize the 5-HT\n6\n receptor and to investigate its distribution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSo far several clinical candidates form the part of indole-type structures and are closely related structurally to the endogenous ligand 5-HT, for example compounds by \nGlennon, R.A. et.al., 2-Substituted tryptamines: agents with selectivity for 5-HT6 serotonin receptors, J.

cyclobutyloxy, cyclopentyloxy or cyclohexyloxy.\n \n\"Cyclo alkyl (C\n3\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy\" means cyclopropylmethyloxy, cyclobutylmethyloxy, cyclopentylmethyloxy or cyclohexylmethyloxy and the like;\n \n\"Heterocyclyl\" means a non-aromatic saturated monocyclic or multicyclic ring system comprising about 3 to 10 ring atoms in which one or more of the atoms in the ring system is an element other than carbon, for example nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur, alone or in combination. Preferred heterocyclyls contain about 5 to 6 ring atoms. The prefix aza, oxa or thia before the heterocyclyl root name means that at least a nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur atom respectively is present as a ring atom. The heterocyclyl can be optionally substituted by replacing an available hydrogen on the ring by one or more substituents, which may be the same or different. The nitrogen or sulfur atom of the heterocyclyl can be optionally oxidized to the corresponding N-oxide, S-oxide or S,S-dioxide. Non- limiting examples of suitable monocyclic heterocyclyl rings include piperidyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperazinyl, pyranyl, tetrahydrothiophenyl, morpholinyl and the like\n \nThe term \"schizophrenia\" means schizophrenia, schizophreniform, disorder, schizoaffective disorder and psychotic disorder wherein the term \"psychotic\" refers to delusions, prominent hallucinations, disorganized speech or disorganized or catatonic behavior. See \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, fourth edition, American Psychiatric Association, Washington, D.C\n.\n \nThe phrase \"pharmaceutically acceptable\" indicates that the substance or composition must be compatible chemically and/or toxicologically, with the other ingredients comprising a formulation, the mammal being treated therewith.\n \n\"Therapeutically effective amount\" is defined as 'an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition or disorder (ii) attenuates, ameliorates or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition or disorder (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder described herein'.\n \nThe terms \"treating\", \"treat\" or \"treatment\" embrace all the meanings such as preventative, prophylactic and palliative.\n \nThe term \"stereoisomers\" is a general term for all isomers of the individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. It includes mirror image isomers (enantiomers), geometric (cis-trans) isomers and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral centre that are not mirror images of one another (diastereomers).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nCertain compounds of formula (I) are capable of existing in stereoisomeric forms (e. g. diastereomers and enantiomers) and the invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated from one another by the usual methods or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. The invention also extends to tautomeric forms and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stereoisomers as a rule are generally obtained as racemates that can be separated into the optically active isomers in a manner known per se. In the case of the compounds of general formula (I) having an asymmetric carbon atom the present invention relates to the D-form, the L-form and D,L- mixtures and in the case of a number of asymmetric carbon atoms, the diastereomeric forms and the invention extends to each of these stereo isomeric forms and to mixtures thereof including racemates. Those compounds of general formula (I) which have an asymmetric carbon and as a rule are obtained as racemates can be separated one from the other by the usual methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereo specific or asymmetric synthesis. However, it is also possible to employ an optically active compound from the start, a correspondingly optically active enantiomeric or diastereomeric compound then being obtained as the final compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stereoisomers of compounds of general formula (I) may be prepared by one or more ways presented below:\n\n \n \n \ni) One or more of the reagents may be used in their optically active form.\n \nii) Optically pure catalyst or chiral ligands along with metal catalyst may be employed in the reduction process. The metal catalyst may be Rhodium, Ruthenium, Indium and the like. The chiral ligands may preferably be chiral phosphines (\nPrinciples of Asymmetric synthesis, J. E. Baldwin Ed., Tetrahedron series, 14,311-316\n).\n \niii) The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as forming diastereomeric salts with chiral acids or chiral amines, or chiral amino alcohols, chiral amino acids. The resulting mixture of diastereomers may then be separated by methods such as fractional crystallization, chromatography and the like, which is followed by an additional step of isolating the optically active product by hydrolyzing the derivative (\nJacques et. al., \"\nEnantiomers, Racemates and Resolution\n\", Wiley Interscience, 1981\n).\n \niv) The mixture of stereoisomers may be resolved by conventional methods such as microbial resolution, resolving the diastereomeric salts formed with chiral acids or chiral bases.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nChiral acids that can be employed may be tartaric acid, mandelic acid, lactic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, amino acids and the like. Chiral bases that can be employed may be cinchona alkaloids, brucine or a basic amino acid such as lysine, arginine and the like.

Suitable amine protecting groups include sulphonyl (e.g. tosyl), acyl (e.g. acetyl, 2', 2', 2'-trichloroethoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl) and arylalkyl (eg. benzyl), which may be removed by hydrolysis (e. g. using an acid such as hydrochloric or trifluoroacetic acid) or reductively (e. g. hydrogenolysis of a benzyl group or reductive removal of a 2', 2', 2'-trichloroethoxycarbonyl group using zinc in acetic acid) as appropriate. Other suitable amine protecting groups include trifluoroacetyl, which may be removed by base catalysed hydrolysis or a solid phase resin bound benzyl group, such as a Merrifield resin bound 2,6-dimethoxybenzyl group (Ellman linker), which may be removed by acid catalyzed hydrolysis, for example with trifluoroacetic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn process (iii) halogenation, hydroxylation, alkylation and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be prepared conventionally by reaction with the appropriate acid or acid derivative as described earlier in detail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to use the compounds of formula (I) in therapy, they will normally be formulated into a pharmaceutical composition in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Thus, the active compounds of the invention may be formulated for oral, buccal, intranasal, parenteral (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous) or rectal administration or a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate).

N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as experimental animals. Four animals were housed in each cage. Animals were kept on 20 % food deprivation before one day and given water ad libitum throughout the experiment and maintained on a 12 hours light/dark cycle. Also the rats were habituated to individual arenas for 1 hour in the absence of any objects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne group of 12 rats received vehicle (1 mL/Kg) orally and another set of animals received compound of the formula (I) either orally or i.p., before one hour of the familiar (T1) and choice trial (T2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe experiment was carried out in a 50 x 50 x 50 cm open field made up of acrylic. In the familiarization phase, (T1), the rats were placed individually in the open field for 3 minutes, in which two identical objects (plastic bottles, 12.5 cm height x 5.5 cm diameter) covered in yellow masking tape alone (a1 and a2) were positioned in two adjacent corners, 10 cm. from the walls. After 24 hours of the (T1) trial for long-term memory test, the same rats were placed in the same arena as they were placed in T1 trial. Choice phase (T2) rats were allowed to explore the open field for 3 minutes in presence of one familiar object (a3) and one novel object (b) (Amber color glass bottle, 12 cm high and 5 cm in diameter). Familiar objects presented similar textures, colors and sizes. During the T1 and T2 trial, explorations of each object (defined as sniffing, licking, chewing or having moving vibrissae whilst directing the nose towards the object at a distance of less than 1 cm) were recorded separately by stopwatch. Sitting on an object was not regarded as exploratory activity, however, it was rarely observed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nT1 is the total time spent exploring the familiar objects (a1 + a2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nT2 is the total time spent exploring the familiar object and novel object (a3 +b).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe object recognition test was performed as described by \nEnnaceur, A., Delacour, J., 1988, A new one-trial test for neurobiological studies of memory in rats - Behavioral data, Behav. Brain Res., 31, 47-59\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome representative compounds have shown positive effects indicating the increased novel object recognition viz; increased exploration time with novel object and higher discrimination index.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 94: Chewing/Yawning/Stretching induction by 5-HT\n6\n R antagonists\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMale Wister rats weighing 200-250 grams were used. Rats were given vehicle injections and placed in individual, transparent chambers for 1 hour each day for 2 days before the test day, to habituate them to the observation chambers and testing procedure. On the test day, rats were placed in the observation chambers immediately after drug administration and observed continuously for yawning, stretching, and chewing behaviors from 60 to 90 minutes after drug or vehicle injections. 60 minutes prior to the drug administration Physostigmine, 0.1 mg/kg i.p, was administered to all the animals. Average number of yawns, stretches and vacuous chewing movements during the 30 minutes observation period were recorded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference: (A) \nKing M. V., Sleight A., J., Woolley M.

The 10 cm\n2\n perspex platform, lying 1 cm below the water surface, was placed in the centre of one of the four imaginary quadrants, which remained constant for all rats. The black Perspex used in the construction of the maze and platform offered no intramaze cues to guide escape behavior. By contrast, the training room offered several strong extramaze visual cues to aid the formation of the spatial map necessary for escape learning. An automated tracking system, [Videomot 2 (5.51), TSE systems, Germany] was employed. This program analyzes video images acquired via a digital camera and an image acquisition board that determined path length, swim speed and the number of entries and duration of swim time spent in each quadrant of the water maze.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference: (A) \nYamada N., Hattoria A., Hayashi T., Nishikawa T., Fukuda H. et.

The training apparatus consisted of a chamber 300 mm in length, 260 mm wide, and 270 mm in height, constructed to established designs. The front and top were transparent, allowing the experimenter to observe the behavior of the animal inside the apparatus. The chamber was divided into two compartments, separated by a central shutter that contained a small opening 50 mm wide and 75 mm high set close to the front of the chamber. The smaller of the compartments measured 9 mm in width and contained a low-power (6V) illumination source. The larger compartment measured 210 mm in width and was not illuminated. The floor of this dark compartment consisted of a grid of 16 horizontal stainless-steel bars that were 5 mm in diameter and spaced 12.5 mm apart. A current generator supplied 0.75 mA to the grid floor, which was scrambled once every 0.5 seconds across the 16 bars. A resistance range of 40-60 micro ohms was calculated for a control group of rats and the apparatus was calibrated accordingly. An electronic circuit detecting the resistance of the animal ensured an accurate current delivery by automatic variation of the voltage with change in resistance.\n\n\n \n\n\nExperimental procedure:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis was carried out as described previously. Adult male Wister rats weighing 200-230 grams were used. Animals were brought to the laboratory 1 hour before the experiment. On the day of training, animals were placed facing the rear of the light compartment of the apparatus. The timer was started once the animal has completely turned to face the front of the chamber. Latency to enter the dark chamber was recorded (usually < 20 seconds) and having completely entered the dark compartment an inescapable foot shock of 0.75 mA for 3 seconds was administered to the animal. Animals were then returned to their home cages. Between each training session, both compartments of the chamber were cleaned to remove any confounding olfactory cues. Recall of this inhibitory stimulus was evaluated 24 hours, 72 hours and on 7 day post-training by returning the animal into the light chamber and recording their latency to enter the dark chamber, a criterion time of 300 seconds was employed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReference: (A) \nCallahan P.

Binding of an agonist to the human 5-HT\n6\n receptor will lead to an increase in adenyl cyclase activity. A compound that is an agonist will show an increase in cAMP production and a compound that is an antagonist will block the agonist effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman 5-HT\n6\n receptors were cloned and stably expressed in HEK293 cells. These cells were plated in 6 well plates in DMEM/F12 media with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 500 µg/mL G418 and incubated at 37 °C in a CO\n2\n incubator. The cells were allowed to grow to about 70 % confluence before initiation of the experiment. On the day of the experiment, the culture media was removed and the cells were washed once with serum free medium (SFM). Two mL of SFM+IBMX media was added and incubated at 37 °C for 10 minutes. The media were removed and fresh SFM+IBMX media containing various compounds and 1 µM serotonin (as antagonist) were added to the appropriate wells and incubated for 30 minutes. Following incubation, the media were removed and the cells were washed once with 1 mL of PBS (phosphate buffered saline). Each well was treated with 1 mL cold 95% ethanol and 5 µM EDTA (2:1) at 4 °C for 1 hour. The cells were then scraped and transferred into Eppendorf tubes. The tubes were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 4 °C and the supernatants were stored at 4 °C until assayed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ncAMP content was determined by EIA (enzyme-immunoassay) using the Amersham Biotrak cAMP EIA kit (Amersham RPN 225). The procedure used is as described for the kit Briefly, cAMP is determined by the competition between unlabeled cAMP and fixed quantity of peroxidase-labelled cAMP for the binding sites on anti-cAMP antibody. The antibody is immobilized onto polystyrene microtitre wells precoated with a second antibody. The reaction is started by adding 50 µL, peroxidase-labeled cAMP to the sample (100 µL) pre-incubated with the antiserum (100 mL) for 2 hours at 4 °C. Following 1 hour incubation at 4 °C, the unbound ligand is separated by a simple washing procedure. Then an enzyme substrate, trimethylbenzidine (1), is added and incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. The reaction is stopped by the addition of 100 mL 1.0 M sulphuric acid and the resultant color read by a microtitre plate spectrophotometer at 450 nm within 30 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the functional adenylyl cyclase assay, some of the compound of this invention was found to be a competitive antagonist with good selectivity over a number of other receptors including other serotonin receptors such as 5-HT\n1A\n and 5-HT\n7\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 99: Rodent Pharmacokinetic Study\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMale wistar rats (230 - 280 grams) obtained from N.

NCE compounds were quantified in the calibration range of 2-2000 ng/ml in plasma and brain homogenate: Study samples were analyzed using calibration samples in the batch and quality control samples spread across the batch.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, Tmax, AUCt, AUCinf, half life, volume of distribution, clearance, mean residence time and thereby Cb/Cp, ratio of NCE in brain versus plasma were calculated by non-compartmental model using software WinNonlin version 4.1.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 101: Rodent Brain Micro dialysis Study for possible modulation of Neurotransmitters.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMale Wister rats (230-280 grams) obtained from N. I. N. (National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India) were used as an experimental animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroup allocation Group I: Vehicle (Water; 5 mL/kg; p.o.), Group 2: NCE (3 mg/kg; p.o.), Group 3: NCE (10 mg/kg; p.o.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurgical Procedure: Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and placed in Stereotaxic frame. Guide cannula (CMA/12) was placed at AP: -5.2 mm, ML: +5.0 mm relative from bregma and DV: -3.8 mm from the brain surface according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (1986). While the animal was still anesthetized, a micro dialysis probe (CMA/12, 4 mm, PC) was inserted through the guide cannula and secured in place. After surgery recovery period of 48 - 72 hours was maintained before subjecting the animal for study.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA day prior to study animals were transferred to home cages for acclimatization and implanted probe was perfused overnight with a modified Ringer's solution comprised of: 1.3 µM CaCl2 (Sigma), 1.0 µM MgCl\n2\n (Sigma), 3.0 µM KCl (Sigma), 147.0 µM NaCl (Sigma), 1.0 µM Na\n2\nHPo\n4\n.7H\n2\nO and 0.2 µM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n.2 H\n2\nO and and 0.3 µM neostigmine bromide (Sigma) (pH to 7.2) at a rate of 0.2 µL/minute set by a microinfusion pump (PicoPlus, Harward). On the day of experiment perfusion rate was changed to 1.2 µL/minutes and allowed for 3 hours stabilization. After stabilization period, four basals were collected at 20 minutes intervals before dosing. Dialysate samplers were collected in glass vials using CMA/170 refrigerated fraction collector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVehicle or NCE (3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) was administered by gavage after four fractions had been collected. The perfusate was collected until 6 hours after administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcetylcholine concentrations in dialysate samples were measured by LC-MS/MS (API 4000, MDS SCIEX) method. Acetylcholine is quantified in the calibration range of 0.250 to 8.004 ng/mL in dialysates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn completion of the microdialysis experiments, the animals were sacrificed and their brains were removed and stored in a 10% formalin solution. Each brain was sliced at 50 µ on a cryostat (Leica) stained and examined microscopically to confirm probe placement. Data from animals with incorrect probe placement were discarded.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicrodialysis data were expressed as percent changes (Mean ± S.E.M.) of baseline that was defined as the average absolute value (in fM/10 µL) of the four samples before drug administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffects of NCE (3 & 10 mg/kg) and Vehicle treatments were statistically evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison tests. In all statistical measures, a p < 0.05 was considered significant. The Graph Pad Prism program statistically evaluated the data."
