Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application is a Divisional of U.S. Ser. No. 11/923,760, filed Oct. 25, 2007 which claims priority to United States Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/854,908, filed Oct. 27, 2006, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to heterocyclic amide compounds useful for treating p38 kinase-associated conditions. The invention further pertains to pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound according to the invention useful for treating kinase-associated conditions, such as p38 kinase-associated conditions, and methods of inhibiting the activity of kinase in a mammal.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nA large number of cytokines participate in the inflammatory response, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α. Overproduction of cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-α are implicated in a wide variety of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, endotoxin shock, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, and congestive heart failure, among others [Henry et al., \nDrugs Fut., \n24:1345-1354 (1999); Salituro et al., \nCurr. Med. Chem., \n6:807-823 (1999)]. Evidence in human patients indicates that protein antagonists of cytokines are effective in treating chronic inflammatory diseases, such as, for example, monoclonal antibody to TNF-α (Enbrel) [Rankin et al., \nBr. J. Rheumatol., \n34:334-342 (1995)], and soluble TNF-α receptor-Fc fusion protein (Etanercept) [Moreland et al., \nAnn. Intern. Med., \n130:478-486 (1999)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biosynthesis of TNF-α occurs in many cell types in response to an external stimulus, such as, for example, a mitogen, an infectious organism, or trauma. Important mediators of TNF-α production are the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and in particular, p38 kinase. These kinases are activated in response to various stress stimuli, including, but not limited to, proinflammatory cytokines, endotoxin, ultraviolet light, and osmotic shock.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne important MAP kinase is p38 kinase, also known as cytokine suppressive anti-inflammatory drug binding protein (CSBP) or IK. Activation of p38 requires dual phosphorylation by upstream MAP kinase kinases (MKK3 and MKK6) on threonine and tyrosine within a Thr-Gly-Tyr motif characteristic of p38 isozymes. There are four known isoforms of p38, i.e., p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ. The α and β isoforms are expressed in inflammatory cells and are key mediators of TNF-α production. Inhibiting the p38α and β enzymes in cells results in reduced levels of TNF-α expression. Also, administering p38α and β inhibitors in animal models of inflammatory disease has proven that such inhibitors are effective in treating those diseases. Accordingly, the p38 enzymes serve an important role in inflammatory processes mediated by IL-1 and TNF-α. While the inhibition of p38α and β enzymes as both forms is noted, it is also of interest to obtain compounds whose inhibition of the p38α form is proportionally higher than the β form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds that reportedly inhibit p38 kinase and cytokines, such as IL-1 and TNF-α for use in treating inflammatory diseases, are disclosed in U.S. Pat.

(The term “heteroarylium” refers to a heteroaryl group bearing a quaternary nitrogen atom and thus a positive charge.) Additionally, one or more (preferably one) carbon ring atoms of the heterocyclo ring may, as valence allows, be replaced with carbonyl group, i.e., —C(═O)—.

The definition of compounds according to the invention embraces all the possible stereoisomers and their mixtures; it also embraces the racemic forms and the isolated optical isomers having the specified activity. The racemic forms can be resolved by physical methods, such as, for example, fractional crystallization, separation, or crystallization of diastereomeric derivatives or separation by chiral column chromatography. The individual optical isomers can be obtained from the racemates from the conventional methods, such as, for example, salt formation with an optically active acid followed by crystallization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the present invention may also have prodrug forms.

A particular example of R\n4 \nis cyclopropyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a more particular embodiment, a group of compounds having preferential activity against the p38α may be found. The alpha selectivity can be seen, for example, using the p38 Assays described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the instant invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound according to Formula I (including all of the subgroups and particular groups described above) and a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier or diluent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn still another embodiment, the present invention is for a method of treating an inflammatory disorder comprising administering to a patient in need of such treatment a pharmaceutical composition according to Formula I (including all of the subgroups and particular groups described above).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the present invention is for a method of inhibiting p38 kinase in a mammal comprising administering to the mammal in need of such treatment at least one compound according to Formula I (including all of the subgroups and particular groups described above).\n\n\n \nUtility\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are selective inhibitors of p38 kinase activity, and in particular, isoforms p38α and p38 μl. Accordingly, compounds of Formula I have utility in treating conditions associated with p38 kinase activity. Such conditions include diseases in which cytokine levels are modulated as a consequence of intracellular signaling via p38, and in particular, diseases that are associated with an overproduction of cytokines IL-1, IL-4, IL-8, and TNF-α. As used herein, the terms “treating” or “treatment” encompass either or both responsive and prophylaxis measures, e.g., measures designed to inhibit or delay the onset of the disease or disorder, achieve a full or partial reduction of the symptoms or disease state, and/or to alleviate, ameliorate, lessen, or cure the disease or disorder and/or its symptoms. When reference is made herein to inhibition of “p-38α/β kinase,” this means that either p38α and/or p38β kinase are inhibited. Thus, reference to an IC50 value for inhibiting p-38α/β kinase means that the compound has such effectiveness for inhibiting at least one of, or both of, p38α and p38β kinases. Additionally, certain compounds identified herein are selective for p38α, having, for example, at least 50-fold more active for p38α kinase as compared to p38β kinase. 100×≧200×\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of their activity as inhibitors of p-38α/β kinase, compounds of Formula I are useful in treating p-38 associated conditions including, but not limited to, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, destructive bone disorders, proliferative disorders, angiogenic disorders, infectious diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, the specific conditions or diseases that may be treated with the inventive compounds include, without limitation, pancreatitis (acute or chronic), asthma, allergies, adult respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, glomerulonephritis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosis, scleroderma, chronic thyroiditis, Graves' disease, autoimmune gastritis, diabetes, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, atopic dermatitis, chronic active hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, graft vs. host disease, inflammatory reaction induced by endotoxin, tuberculosis, atherosclerosis, muscle degeneration, cachexia, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, gout, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, acute synovitis, pancreatic β-cell disease; diseases characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration; rheumatoid spondylitis, gouty arthritis and other arthritic conditions, cerebral malaria, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, silicosis, pulmonary sarcoisosis, bone resorption disease, allograft rejections, fever and myalgias due to infection, cachexia secondary to infection, meloid formation, scar tissue formation, ulcerative colitis, pyresis, influenza, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and multiple myeloma-related bone disorder, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, metastatic melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, multiple myeloma, sepsis, septic shock, and Shigellosis; Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, cerebral ischemias or neurodegenerative disease caused by traumatic injury; angiogenic disorders including solid tumors, ocular neovasculization, and infantile haemangiomas; viral diseases including acute hepatitis infection (including hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C), HIV infection and CMV retinitis, AIDS, ARC or malignancy, and herpes; stroke, myocardial ischemia, ischemia in stroke heart attacks, organ hyposia, vascular hyperplasia, cardiac and renal reperfusion injury, thrombosis, cardiac hypertrophy, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, endotoxemia and/or toxic shock syndrome, and conditions associated with prostaglandin endoperoxidase syndase-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, p38 inhibitors of this invention inhibit the expression of inducible pro-inflammatory proteins such as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 (PGHS-2), also referred to as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Accordingly, additional p38-associated conditions include edema, analgesia, fever and pain, such as neuromuscular pain, headache, pain caused by cancer, dental pain and arthritis pain. The inventive compounds also may be used to treat veterinary viral infections, such as lentivirus infections, including, but not limited to equine infectious anemia virus; or retro virus infections, including feline immunodeficiency virus, bovine immunodeficiency virus, and canine immunodeficiency virus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the terms “p38 associated condition” or “p38 associated disease or disorder” are used herein, each is intended to encompass all of the conditions identified above as if repeated at length, as well as any other condition that is affected by p38 kinase activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticular examples of diseases that would benefit from p38 inhibitors are asthma, adult respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, osteoporosis, psoriasis, graft vs. host rejection, atherosclerosis, acute coronary disease, multiple myeloma, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, pain, myocardial ischemia and arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, gouty arthritis and osteoarthritis, and especially rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention thus provides methods for treating such conditions, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of at least one compound of Formula I or a salt thereof. The methods of treating p38 kinase-associated conditions may comprise administering compounds of Formula I alone or in combination with each other and/or other suitable therapeutic agents useful in treating such conditions. Exemplary of such other therapeutic agents include corticosteroids, rolipram, calphostin, CSAIDs, 4-substituted imidazo[1,2-A]quinoxalines as disclosed in U.S. Pat.

In the methods of the present invention, such other therapeutic agent(s) may be administered prior to, simultaneously with, or following the administration of the inventive compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions capable of treating p38-kinase associated conditions, including TNF-α, IL-1, and/or IL-8 mediated conditions, as described above. The inventive compositions may contain other therapeutic agents as described above and may be formulated, for example, by employing conventional solid or liquid vehicles or diluents, as well as pharmaceutical additives of a type appropriate to the mode of desired administration (e.g., excipients, binders, preservatives, stabilizers, flavors, etc.) according to techniques such as those well known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula I may be administered by any means suitable for the condition to be treated, which may depend on the need for site-specific treatment or quantity of drug to be delivered. Topical administration is generally preferred for skin-related diseases, and systematic treatment preferred for cancerous or pre-cancerous conditions, although other modes of delivery are contemplated. For example, the compounds may be delivered orally, such as in the form of tablets, capsules, granules, powders, or liquid formulations including syrups; topically, such as in the form of solutions, suspensions, gels or ointments; sublingually; bucally; parenterally, such as by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular or intrasternal injection or infusion techniques (e.g., as sterile injectable aq. or non-aq. solutions or suspensions); nasally such as by inhalation spray; topically, such as in the form of a cream or ointment; rectally such as in the form of suppositories; or liposomally. Dosage unit formulations containing non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles or diluents may be administered. The compounds may be administered in a form suitable for immediate release or extended release. Immediate release or extended release may be achieved with suitable pharmaceutical compositions or, particularly in the case of extended release, with devices such as subcutaneous implants or osmotic pumps.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary compositions for topical administration include a topical carrier such as PLASTIBASE® (mineral oil gelled with polyethylene).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary compositions for oral administration include suspensions which may contain, for example, microcrystalline cellulose for imparting bulk, alginic acid or sodium alginate as a suspending agent, methylcellulose as a viscosity enhancer, and sweeteners or flavoring agents such as those known in the art; and immediate release tablets which may contain, for example, microcrystalline cellulose, dicalcium phosphate, starch, magnesium stearate and/or lactose and/or other excipients, binders, extenders, disintegrants, diluents and lubricants such as those known in the art. The inventive compounds may also be orally delivered by sublingual and/or buccal administration, e.g., with molded, compressed, or freeze-dried tablets. Exemplary compositions may include fast-dissolving diluents such as mannitol, lactose, sucrose, and/or cyclodextrins. Also included in such formulations may be high molecular weight excipients such as celluloses (AVICEL®) or polyethylene glycols (PEG); an excipient to aid mucosal adhesion such as hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC), and/or maleic anhydride copolymer (e.g., GANTREZ®); and agents to control release such as polyacrylic copolymer (e.g., CARBOPOL 934®). Lubricants, glidants, flavors, coloring agents and stabilizers may also be added for ease of fabrication and use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary compositions for nasal aerosol or inhalation administration include solutions which may contain, for example, benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance absorption and/or bioavailability, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents such as those known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary compositions for parenteral administration include injectable solutions or suspensions which may contain, for example, suitable non-toxic, parenterally acceptable diluents or solvents, such as mannitol, 1,3-butanediol, water, Ringer's solution, an isotonic sodium chloride solution, or other suitable dispersing or wetting and suspending agents, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides, and fatty acids, including oleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary compositions for rectal administration include suppositories which may contain, for example, suitable non-irritating excipients, such as cocoa butter, synthetic glyceride esters or polyethylene glycols, which are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquefy and/or dissolve in the rectal cavity to release the drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effective amount of a compound of the present invention may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, and includes exemplary dosage amounts for a mammal of from about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg of body weight of active compound per day, which may be administered in a single dose or in the form of individual divided doses, such as from 1 to 4 times per day. It will be understood that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular subject may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the species, age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the subject, the mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and severity of the particular condition. Preferred subjects for treatment include animals, most preferably mammalian species such as humans, and domestic animals such as dogs, cats, horses, and the like. Thus, when the term “patient” is used herein, this term is intended to include all subjects, most preferably mammalian species, that are affected by mediation of p38 enzyme levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of Formula I, including the compounds described in the examples hereof, have been tested in one or more of the assays described below and have shown activity as inhibitors of p38α/β enzymes and TNF-α.\n\n\n \nBiological Assays\n\n\nGeneration of p38 Kinases\n\n\n \n \n \nFor this assay, cDNAs of human p38α, β, and γ isozymes were cloned by PCR. These cDNAs were subcloned in the pGEX expression vector (Pharmacia). GST-p38 fusion protein was expressed in \nE. Coli \nand purified from bacterial pellets by affinity chromatography using glutathione agarose. p38 fusion protein was activated by incubating with constitutively active MKK6. Active p38 was separated from MKK6 by affinity chromatography. Constitutively active MKK6 was generated according to Raingeaud et al. (\nMol. Cell. Biol., \n1247-1255 (1996)).\n\n\n \nTNF-α Production by LPS-Stimulated PBMC's\n\n\n \n \n \nHeparinized human whole blood was obtained from healthy volunteers. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified from human whole blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and resuspended at a concentration of 5×10\n6\n/ml in assay medium (RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum). 50 μl of cell suspension was incubated with 50 μl of test compound (4× concentration in assay medium containing 0.2% DMSO) in 96-well tissue culture plates for 5 minutes at RT. 100 μl of LPS (200 ng/ml stock) was then added to the cell suspension and the plate was incubated for 6 hours at 37° C. Following incubation, the culture medium was collected and stored at −20° C. TNF-α concentration in the medium was quantified using a standard ELISA kit (Pharmingen-San Diego, Calif.). Concentrations of TNF-α and IC\n50 \nvalues for test compounds (concentration of compound that inhibited LPS-stimulated TNF-α production by 50%) were calculated by linear regression analysis.\n\n\n \np38 Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe assays were performed in V-bottomed 96-well plates. The final assay volume was 60 μl prepared from three 20 μl additions of enzyme, substrates (MBP and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT). Bacterially expressed, activated p38 was pre-incubated with test compounds for 10 min. prior to initiation of reaction with substrates. The reaction was incubated at 25° C. for 45 min. and terminated by adding 5 μl of 0.5 M EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was aspirated onto a pre-wet filtermat using a Skatron Micro96 Cell Harvester (Skatron, Inc.), then washed with PBS. The filtermat was then dried in a microwave oven for 1 min., treated with MeltilLex A scintillation wax (Wallac), and counted on a Microbeta scintillation counter Model 1450 (Wallac) Inhibition data were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares regression using Prizm (GraphPadSoftware). The final concentration of reagents in the assays are ATP, 1 μM; [γ-\n33\nP]ATP, 3 nM; MBP (Sigma, #M1891), 2 μg/well; p38, 10 nM; and DMSO, 0.3%. One particular group of compounds of interest are those with both (1) an activity of <100 nm versus p38 alpha and (2) and a selectivity for alpha versus beta (for example, a 50-fold, 100-fold or 200-fold selectivity). The compounds in Examples 127-225 have at least a 50-fold alpha selectivity.\n\n\n \nTNF-α Production by LPS-Stimulated Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nMice (Balb/c female, 6-8 weeks of age, Harlan Labs; n=8/treatment group) were injected intraperitoneally with 50 μg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS; \nE coli \nstrain 0111:B4, Sigma) suspended in sterile saline. Ninety minutes later, mice were sedated by CO\n2\n:O\n2 \ninhalation and a blood sample was obtained. Serum was separated and analyzed for TNF-alpha concentrations by commercial ELISA assay per the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest compounds were administered orally at various times before LPS injection. The compounds were dosed either as suspensions or as solutions in various vehicles or solubilizing agents.\n\n\n \n \np38α Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assays were performed in U-bottom 384-well plates. The final assay volume was 30 ul prepared from 15 ul additions of enzyme and substrates (fluoresceinated peptide and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.015% Brij35 and 4 mM DTT). The reaction was initiated by the combination of activated p38alpha with substrates and test compounds. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. and terminated by adding 45 ul of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LabChip 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product. Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentration of reagents in the assays are ATP, 20 uM; FL-P38a peptide, 1.5 uM; p38alpha, 6 nM; and DMSO, 1.6%.\n\n\n \n \np38β Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assays were performed in U-bottom 384-well plates.

No. 60/812,077, filed 9 Jun. 2006.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n1. Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to sodium channel blockers possessing beta-adrenergic receptor agonist activity. The present invention also includes a variety of methods of treatment using these inventive sodium channel blockers/beta-adrenergic receptor agonists.\n\n\n2. Description of the Background\n\n\nThe mucosal surfaces at the interface between the environment and the body have evolved a number of “innate defenses”, i.e., protective mechanisms. A principal form of such an innate defense is to cleanse these surfaces with liquid. Typically, the quantity of the liquid layer on a mucosal surface reflects the balance between epithelial liquid secretion, often reflecting anion (Cl\n− \nand/or HCO\n3\n \n−\n) secretion coupled with water (and a cation counter-ion) and epithelial liquid absorption, often reflecting Na\n+ \nabsorption, coupled with water and counter anion (Cl\n− \nand/or HCO\n3\n \n−\n). Many diseases of mucosal surfaces are caused by too little protective liquid on those mucosal surfaces created by an imbalance between secretion (too little) and absorption (relatively too much). The defective salt transport processes that characterize these mucosal dysfunctions reside in the epithelial layer of the mucosal surface.\n\n\nOne approach to replenish the protective liquid layer on mucosal surfaces is to “re-balance” the system by blocking Na\n+ \nchannel and liquid absorption and simultaneously activating beta-adrenergic receptors thereby causing liquid secretion. The epithelial protein that mediates the rate-limiting step of Na\n+ \nand liquid absorption is the epithelial Na\n+ \nchannel (ENaC). ENaC and beta-adrenergic receptors are positioned on the apical surface of the epithelium, i.e. the mucosal surface-extermal environment interface. Therefore, to inhibit ENaC mediated Na\n+\n and liquid absorption, an ENaC blocker of the amiloride class (which blocks from the extracellular domain of ENaC) must be delivered to the mucosal surface and, importantly, be maintained at this site, to achieve therapeutic utility. The present invention describes diseases characterized by too little liquid on mucosal surfaces and “topical” sodium channel blockers containing beta-adrenergic receptor agonist activity designed to exhibit the increased potency, reduced mucosal absorption, and slow dissociation (“unbinding” or detachment) from ENaC and the beta-adrenergic receptor required for therapy of these diseases.\n\n\nChronic bronchitis (CB), including the most common lethal genetic form of chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis (CF), are diseases that reflect the body's failure to clear mucus normally from the lungs, which ultimately produces chronic airways infection. In the normal lung, the primary defense against chronic intrapulmonary airways infection (chronic bronchitis) is mediated by the continuous clearance of mucus from bronchial airway surfaces. This function in health subjects effectively removes from the lung potentially noxious toxins and pathogens. Recent data indicate that the initiating problem, i.e., the “basic defect,” in both CB and CF is the failure to clear mucus from airway surfaces. The failure to clear mucus reflects an imbalance between the amount of liquid and mucin on airway surfaces. This “airway surface liquid” (ASL) is primarily composed of salt and water in proportions similar to plasma (i.e., isotonic). Mucin macromolecules are organized into a well defined “mucus layer” which normally traps inhaled bacteria and are transported out of the lung via the actions of cilia which beat in a watery, low viscosity solution termed the “periciliary liquid” (PCL). In the disease state, there is an imbalance in the quantities of mucus and ASL on airway surfaces. This imbalance results in a relative reduction in ASL which leads to mucus concentration, a reduction in the lubricant activity of the PCL, and a failure to clear mucus via ciliary activity to the mouth. The reduction in mechanical clearance of mucus from the lung leads to chronic bacterial colonization of mucus adherent to airway surfaces. It is the chronic retention of bacteria, the failure of local antimicrobial substances to kill mucus-entrapped bacteria on a chronic basis, and the consequent chronic inflammatory responses of the body to this type of surface infection, that lead to the syndromes of CB and CF.\n\n\nThe current afflicted population in the U.S. is 12,000,000 patients with the acquired (primarily from cigarette smoke exposure) form of chronic bronchitis and approximately 30,000 patients with the genetic form, cystic fibrosis. Approximately equal numbers of both populations are present in Europe. In Asia, there is little CF but the incidence of CB is high and, like the rest of the world, is increasing.\n\n\nThere is currently a large, unmet medical need for products that specifically treat CB and CF at the level of the basic defect that cause these diseases. The current therapies for chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis focus on treating the symptoms and/or the late effects of these diseases. Thus, for chronic bronchitis, inhaled β-agonists, steroids, anti-cholinergic agents, and oral theophyllines and phosphodiesterase inhibitors are all in current use. However, none of these drugs alone effectively treat the fundamental problem of the failure to clear mucus from the lung. Similarly, in cystic fibrosis, the same spectrum of pharmacologic agents are used. These strategies have been complemented by more recent strategies designed to clear the CF lung of the DNA (“Pulmozyme”; Genentech) that has been deposited in the lung by neutrophils that have futilely attempted to kill the bacteria that grow in adherent mucus masses and through the use of inhaled antibiotics (e. “TOBI”) designed to augment the lungs' own killing mechanisms to rid the adherent mucus plaques of bacteria. A general principle of the body is that if the initiating lesion is not treated, in this case mucus retention/obstruction, bacterial infections become chronic and increasingly refractory to antimicrobial therapy. Thus, a major unmet therapeutic need for both CB and CF lung diseases is an effective means of re-hydrating airway mucus restoring/expanding the volume of the ASL) and promoting its clearance, with bacteria, from the lung.\n\n\nR. C. Boucher, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,264,975, describes the use of pyrazinoylguanidine sodium channel blockers for hydrating mucosal surfaces. These compounds, typified by the well-known diuretics amiloride, benzamil, and phenamil, are effective. However; these compounds suffer from the significant disadvantage that they are (1) relatively impotent, which is important because the mass of drug that can be inhaled by the lung is limited; (2) rapidly absorbed, which limits the half-life of the drug on the mucosal surface; and (3) are freely dissociable from ENaC. The sum of these disadvantages embodied in these well known diurectics produces compounds with insufficient potency and/or effective half-life on mucosal surfaces to have therapeutic benefit for hydrating mucosal surfaces.\n\n\nClearly, what is needed are drugs that are more effective at restoring the clearance of mucus from the lungs of patients with CB/CF. The value of these new therapies will be reflected in improvements in the quality and duration of life for both the CF and the CB populations.\n\n\nOther mucosal surfaces in and on the body exhibit subtle differences in the normal physiology of the protective surface liquids on their surfaces but the pathophysiology of disease reflects a common theme, i.e., too little protective surface liquid. For example, in xerostomia (dry mouth) the oral cavity is depleted of liquid due to a failure of the parotid sublingual and submandibular glands to secrete liquid despite continued Na\n+ \n(ENaC) transport mediated liquid absorption from the oral cavity. Similarly, keratoconjunctivitis sira (dry eye) is caused by failure of lacrimal glands to secrete liquid in the face of continued Na\n+\n dependent liquid absorption on conjunctional surfaces. In rhinosinusitis, there is an imbalance, as in CB, between mucin secretion and relative ASL depletion. Finally, in the gastrointestinal tract, failure to secrete Cl− (and liquid) in the proximal small intestine, combined with increased Na\n+\n (and liquid) absorption in the terminal ileum leads to the distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). In older patients, excessive Na\n+ \n(and volume) absorption in the descending colon produces chronic constipation and diverticulitis.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIt is an object of the present invention to provide compounds that have both sodium channel blocking activity and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist activity in the same molecule.\n\n\nIt is an object of the present invention to provide compounds that are more potent and/or absorbed less rapidly from mucosal surfaces, and/or are less reversible as compared to known compounds.\n\n\nIt is another aspect of the present invention to provide compounds that are more potent and/or absorbed less rapidly and/or exhibit less reversibility, as compared to compounds such as amilorde, benzamil, and phenamil. Therefore, the compounds will give a prolonged pharmacodynamic half-life on mucosal surfaces as compared to known compounds.\n\n\nIt is another object of the present invention to provide compounds which are (1) absorbed less rapidly from mucosal surfaces, especially airway surfaces, as compared to known compounds and; (2) when absorbed from musosal surfaces after administration to the mucosal surfaces, are converted in vivo into metabolic derivatives thereof which have reduced efficacy in blocking sodium channels and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist activity as compared to the administered parent compound.\n\n\nIt is another object of the present invention to provide compounds that are more potent and/or absorbed less rapidly and/or exhibit less reversibility, as compared to compounds such as amiloride, benzamil, and phenamil. Therefore, such compounds will give a prolonged pharmacodynamic half-life on mucosal surfaces as compared to previous compounds.\n\n\nIt is another object of the present invention to provide methods of treatment that take advantage of the pharmacological properties of the compounds described above.\n\n\nIn particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide methods of treatment which rely on rehydration of mucosal surfaces.\n\n\nAny of the compounds described herein can be a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and wherein the above compounds are inclusive of all racemates, enantiomers, diastereomers, tautomers, polymorphs and pseudopolymorphs thereof. Polymorphs are different physical forms—different crystal forms that have differing melting ranges, show differing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tracings and exhibit different X-Ray powder diffraction (XRPD) spectra. Pseudopolymorphs are different solvated physical forms—different crystal forms that have differing melting ranges as solvates, show differing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tracings as solvates and exhibit different X-Ray powder diffraction (XRPD) spectra as solvates.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions which contain a compound described

Therefore, the compounds of formula (I) have a longer half-life on mucosal surfaces as compared to these compounds.\n\n\nThe present invention is also based on the discovery that certain compounds embraced by formula (I) are converted in vivo into metabolic derivatives thereof that have reduced efficacy in blocking sodium channels and acting as beta-adrenergic receptor agonists as compared to the parent administered compound, after they are absorbed from mucosal surfaces after administration. This important property means that the compounds will have a lower tendency to cause undesired side-effects by blocking sodium channels and activating beta-receptors located at other untargeted locations in the body of the recipient, e.g., in the kidneys and heart.\n\n\nMono drug therapy leaves most major diseases such as chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis inadequately treated. It is therefore often necessary to discover and develop novel drugs or combination of drugs which treat and modulate multiple targets simultaneously (polypharmacology) with the goal of enhancing efficacy or improving safety relative to single target drugs. There are three possible ways to achieve this. 1) Combining therapeutic “cocktails” of two or more individual drugs; the benefits of this approach are often lessened by poor patient compliance. 2). A multiple component drug (“fixed combination” or multiple component drug) that contains two or more agents in a single tablet, liquid formulation, inhaler or dry powder device. This can sometimes improve patient compliance versus multiple component drugs but adds the complexity of carefully dosing so as to minimize multiple metabolic pathways. 3). A single molecular entity which can simultaneously modulate multiple drug targets (designed multiple ligands). The advantage of a multiple ligand over the first two approaches is that it improves compliance, enhances efficacy, it targets a known set of deficiencies in multiple systems with a single new chemical entity, it often lacks the unpredictable differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability between patients, it is often easier to formulate and potentially lowers the risk of drug-drug interactions compared to drug cocktails and multiple component drugs. It was therefore our goal to discover multiple ligands that have both sodium channel blocking activity as well as beta agonist activity.\n\n\nThe addition of beta-adrenergic receptor agonist activity to a sodium channel blocker will significantly increase the capacity to hydrate airway surfaces in subjects in need of hydration for therapeutic purposes. The mechanism by which beta-agonist activity adds to the hydration capacity of Na channel blockers alone, or beta-agonists alone, is described in the following diagrams that describe the electrochemical gradients for ion flows and the net secretion that results from these forces in airway epithelia.\n\n\nAs shown in \nFIG. 1\n, under baseline conditions human airway epithelia absorb NaCl and H\n2\nO. Active Na\n+ \nabsorption drives this process. Cl\n− \nis absorbed passively with Na\n+ \nto preserve electroneutrality. As there is no net driving force for Cl\n− \nto move across the apical cell membrane, Cl\n− \nis absorbed paracellularly in response to the transepithelial electric potential. Water moves cellularly and paracellularly in response to the osmotic gradients generated by NaCl absorption.\n\n\nApplication of a Na\n+ \nchannel blocker (as an example amiloride is shown) inhibits the entry of Na\n+ \ninto the cell which: (1) abolishes Na\n+ \nabsorption and (2) hyperpolarizes the apical cell membrane (Va). The hyperpolarization of Va generates an electrochemical driving force favoring Cl\n− \nsecretion Na\n+ \nnow follows in the secretory direction via the paracellular path). The rate of Cl\n− \nsecretion is proportional to the activity of the apical membrane Cl\n− \nchannels which are typically 30-50% maximally active under basal conditions. In summary, application of a Na\n+ \nchannel blocker inhibits Na\n+ \nabsorption and triggers a modest amount of secretion. Note again that water will follow transcellularly in response to the secreted NaCl.\n\n\nIn contrast, as depicted in \nFIG. 2\n, addition of a beta-agonist (as an example isoproterenol is shown) alone to human airway epithelia produces no changes in Na\n+ \nabsorption or Cl\n− \nsecretion. The reason for this absence of effect is that there is no electrochemical driving force for to move across the cell (See the following references: Intracellular Cl− activity and cellular Cl− pathways in cultured human airway epithelium. Am J. Physiol. 1989 May; 256 (5 Pt 1):C1033-44. Willumsen N J, Davis C W, Boucher R C Cellular Cl− transport in cultured cystic fibrosis airway epithelium. Am J. Physiol. 1989 May; 256 (5 Pt 1):C1045-53. Willumsen N J, Davis C W, Boucher R C Activation of an apical Cl− conductance by Ca2+ ionophores in cystic fibrosis airway epithelia. Am J. Physiol. 1989 February; 256 (2 Pt 1):C226-33. Willumsen N J, Boucher R C). Thus, a beta-agonist mediated activation of an apical membrane Cl\n− \nchannel, usually CFTR via changes in cAMP, produces no change in the rate of movement of Cl\n− \nacross the barrier and, hence, no change in transepithelial sodium chloride or water secretion.\n\n\nHowever, when a Na channel blocker is administered with a beta-agonist, additivity between these two classes of compounds is achieved with the result being accelerated Cl\n− \n(and Na\n+\n, H\n2\nO) secretion. The mechanism underlying the additivity is shown in \nFIG. 3\n. In the presence of a Na channel blocker, an electrochemical gradient for CF secretion is generated (also see \nFIG. 1\n). Now when a beta-agonist is present, it converts the apical membrane CFTR from ˜30% basal activity to ˜100% activity via beta-agonist induced increase in cAMP that ultimately activates CFTR via PKA (protein kinase A). Because there is an electrochemical driving force favoring Cl\n− \nsecretion as a result of ENaC blockade, the increase in Cl\n− \nchannel activity translates into increasing Cl\n− \n(and Na\n+\n, H\n2\nO) secretion. Thus, the hydration capacity of the epithelia is greatly enhanced by the presence of both Na\n+ \nchannel blocker and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist activities in the environment bathing the human airway epithelia as compared to just Na\n+ \nchannel blocker or beta-adrenergic receptor agonist by themselves. A discovery of this invention is that administration of both activities contained within the same molecule to the epithelium is at least as effective as sequential administration of a Na channel blocker followed by a beta-agonist and therefore has the advantages cited earlier.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula I exist primarily as a combination of the three tautomers shown \nFIG. 4\n, \nFIG. 4\n shows the three tautomers represented in formula I that exist in solution. Previous studies by Smith et al. have shown that the free base exists primarily as the acylimino tautomer, whereas the physiologically active species exists as the protonated form of the acylamino tautomer (\nFIG. 1\n, ref R L Smith et. Al. Journal of the American Chemical Society, 1979, 101, 191-201). These structural representations have been used to represent amiloride and its analogs in both the patent and scientific literature. We use both the acylamino and acylimino representations for convenience throughout this patent with the understanding that the structures are in reality a hybrid of the three forms with the actual amount of each dependent on the pH, the cite of action and the nature of the substituents.\n\n\nIn the compounds represented by formula (I), X may be hydrogen, halogen, trifluoromethyl, lower alkyl, lower cycloalkyl, unsubstituted or substituted phenyl, lower alkyl-thio, phenyl-lower alkyl-thio, lower alkyl-sulfonyl, or phenyl-lower alkyl-sulfonyl.

This range includes all specific values of carbon atoms and subranges there between, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 carbon atoms. The term “alkyl” embraces all types of such groups, e.g., linear, branched, and cyclic alkyl groups. This description is applicable to the term “lower alkyl” as used throughout the present disclosure.

The variables o and p may each be an integer from 0 to 10, subject to the proviso that the sum of o and p in the chain is from 1 to 10. Thus, o and p may each be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. Accordingly, the sum of o and p can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10, or any subrange therebetween. Preferably, the sum of o and p is from 2 to 6.

Alternatively, the compounds may be prepared and used as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are salts that retain or enhance the desired biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological effects. Examples of such salts are (a) acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and the like; (b) salts formed with organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, citric acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, tannic acid, palmitic acid, alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acid, polygalacturonic acid, malonic acid, sulfosalicylic acid, glycolic acid, 2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate, pamoate, salicylic acid, stearic acid, phthalic acid, mandelic acid, lactic acid and the like; and (c) salts formed from elemental anions for example, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.\n\n\nIt is to be noted that all enantiomers, diastereomers, tautomers and racemic mixtures of compounds within the scope of formula (I) are embraced by the present invention. All mixtures of such enantiomers and diastereomers are within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nWithout being limited to any particular theory, it is believed that the compounds of formula (I) function in vivo as sodium channel blockers and as beta receptor agonists. By blocking epithelial sodium channels as well as activating beta-receptors present in mucosal surfaces the compounds of formula (I) reduce the absorption of water by the mucosal surfaces. This effect increases the volume of protective liquids on mucosal surfaces, rebalances the system, and thus treats disease.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides methods of treatment that take advantage of the properties of the compounds of formula (I) discussed above. Thus, subjects that may be treated by the methods of the present invention include, but are not limited to, patients afflicted with cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive airway disease, artificially ventilated patients, patients with acute pneumonia, etc. The present invention may be used to obtain a sputum sample from a patient by administering the active compounds to at least one lung of a patient, and then inducing or collecting a sputum sample from that patient. Typically, the invention will be administered to respiratory mucosal surfaces via aerosol (liquid or dry powders) or lavage.\n\n\nSubjects that may be treated by the method of the present invention also include patients being administered supplemental oxygen nasally (a regimen that tends to dry the airway surfaces); patients afflicted with an allergic disease or response (e.g., an allergic response to pollen, dust, animal hair or particles, insects or insect particles, etc.) that affects nasal airway surfaces; patients afflicted with a bacterial infection e.g., \nstaphylococcus \ninfections such as \nStaphylococcus aureus \ninfections, \nHemophilus influenza \ninfections, \nStreptococcus pneumoniae \ninfections, \nPseudomonas aeuriginosa \ninfections, etc.) of the nasal airway surfaces; patients afflicted with an inflammatory disease that affects nasal airway surfaces; or patients afflicted with sinusitis (wherein the active agent or agents are administered to promote drainage of congested mucous secretions in the sinuses by administering an amount effective to promote drainage of congested fluid in the sinuses), or combined, Rhinosinusitis. The invention may be administered to rhino-sinal surfaces by topical delivery, including aerosols and drops.\n\n\nThe present invention may be used to hydrate mucosal surfaces other than airway surfaces. Such other mucosal surfaces include gastrointestinal surfaces, oral surfaces, genito-urethral (vaginal) surfaces, ocular surfaces or surfaces of the eye, the inner ear and the middle ear. For example, the active compounds of the present invention may be administered by any suitable means, including locally/topically, orally, or rectally, in an effective amount.\n\n\nThe present invention is concerned primarily with the treatment of human subjects, but may also be employed for the treatment of other mammalian subjects, such as dogs and cats, for veterinary purposes.\n\n\nAs discussed above, the compounds used to prepare the compositions of the present invention may be in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable free base. Because the free base of the compound is generally less soluble in aqueous solutions than the salt, free base compositions are employed to provide more sustained release of active agent to the lungs. An active agent present in the lungs in particulate form which has not dissolved into solution yet serves as a depot of drug which gradually becomes bioavailable as it slowly dissolves into solution.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition, comprising a compound of formula (I) in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (e.g., an aqueous carrier solution). In general, the compound of formula (I) is included in the composition in an amount effective to inhibit the reabsorption of water by mucosal surfaces.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may also be used in conjunction with a P2Y2 receptor agonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (also sometimes referred to as an “active agent” herein). The composition may further comprise a P2Y2 receptor agonist or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (also sometimes referred to as an “active agent” herein). The P2Y2 receptor agonist is typically included in an amount effective to stimulate chloride and water secretion by airway surfaces, particularly nasal airway surfaces. Suitable P2Y2 receptor agonists are described in columns 9-10 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,264,975, U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,256, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,292,498, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nBronchodilators can also be used in combination with compounds of the present invention. These bronchodilators include, hut are not limited to, anticholinergic agents including but not limited to ipratropium bromide, as well as compounds such as theophylline and aminophylline. These compounds may be administered in accordance with known techniques, either prior to or concurrently with the active compounds described herein.\n\n\nIonic and organic osmolytes can also be used in combination with compounds of the present invention. Ionic osmolytes useful include any salt consisting of a pharmaceutically acceptable anion and a pharmaceutical cation. Organic osmolytes include, but are not limited to, sugars, sugar alcohols and organic osmolytes. Detailed examples of ionic and non-ionic osmolytes are given in U.S. Pat. No. 6,926,911 incorporated herein by reference. A particularly useful ionic osmolyte is hypertonic sodium chloride or sodium nitrite. A particularly useful organic osmolyte is the reduced sugar mannitol.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention is a pharmaceutical formulation, comprising an active compound as described above in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (e.g., an aqueous carrier solution). In general, the active compound is included in the composition in an amount effective to treat mucosal surfaces, such as inhibiting the reabsorption of water by mucosal surfaces, including airway and other surfaces.\n\n\nThe active compounds disclosed herein may be administered to mucosal surfaces by any suitable means, including topically, orally, rectally, vaginally, ocularly and dermally, etc. For example, for the treatment of constipation, the active compounds may be administered orally or rectally to the gastrointestinal mucosal surface. The active compound may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in any suitable form, such as sterile physiological or dilute saline or topical solution, as a droplet, tablet or the like for oral administration, as a suppository for rectal or genito-urethral administration, etc. Excipients may be included in the formulation to enhance the solubility of the active compounds, as desired.\n\n\nThe active compounds disclosed herein may be administered to the airway surfaces of a patient by any suitable means, including as a spray, mist, or droplets of the active compounds in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as physiological or dilute saline solutions or distilled water. For example, the active compounds may be prepared as formulations and administered as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,391 to Jacobus, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\nSolid or liquid particulate active agents prepared for practicing the present invention could, as noted above, include particles of respirable or non-respirable size; that is, for respirable particles, particles of a size sufficiently small to pass through the mouth and larynx upon inhalation and into the bronchi and alveoli of the lungs, and for non-respirable particles, particles sufficiently large to be retained in the nasal airway passages rather than pass through the larynx and into the bronchi and alveoli of the lungs. In general, particles ranging from about 1 to 5 microns in size (more particularly, less than about 4.7 microns in size) are respirable. Particles of non-respirable size are greater than about 5 microns in size, up to the size of visible droplets. Thus, for nasal administration, a particle size in the range of 10-500 may be used to ensure retention in the nasal cavity.\n\n\nIn the manufacture of a formulation according to the invention, active agents or the physiologically acceptable salts or free bases thereof are typically admixed with, inter cilia, an acceptable carrier. Of course, the carrier must be compatible with any other ingredients in the formulation and must not be deleterious to the patient. The carrier must be solid or liquid, or both, and is preferably formulated with the compound as a unit-dose formulation, for example, a capsule, that may contain 0.5% to 99% by weight of the active compound. One or more active compounds may be incorporated in the formulations of the invention, which formulations may be prepared by any of the well-known techniques of pharmacy consisting essentially of admixing the components.\n\n\nCompositions containing respirable or non-respirable dry particles of micronized active agent may be prepared by grinding the dry active agent with a mortar and pestle, and then passing the micronized composition through a 400 mesh screen to break up or separate out large agglomerates.\n\n\nThe particulate active agent composition may optionally contain a dispersant which serves to facilitate the formulation of an aerosol. A suitable dispersant is lactose, which may be blended with the active agent in any suitable ratio (e.g., a 1 to 1 ratio by weight).\n\n\nActive compounds disclosed herein may be administered to airway surfaces including the nasal passages, sinuses and lungs of a subject by a suitable means know in the art, such as by nose drops, mists, etc. In one embodiment of the invention, the active compounds of the present invention and administered by transbronchoscopic lavage. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the active compounds of the present invention are deposited on lung airway surfaces by administering an aerosol suspension of respirable particles comprised of the active compound, which the subject inhales. The respirable particles may be liquid or solid. Numerous inhalers for administering aerosol particles to the lungs of a subject are known.\n\n\nInhalers such as those developed by Nolctar Therapeutic Systems, Palo Alto, Calif., USA, may be employed, including but not limited to those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,740,794; 5,654,007; 5,458,135; 5,775,320; and 5,785,049, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. The Applicant specifically intends that the disclosures of all patent references cited herein be incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Inhalers such as those developed by Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego, Calif., USA, may also be employed, including but not limited to those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,622,166; 5,577,497; 5,645,051; and 5,492,112, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, inhalers such as those developed by Aradigm Corp., Hayward, Calif., USA, may be employed, including but not limited to those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,826,570; 5,813,397; 5,819,726; and 5,655,516, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. These apparatuses are particularly suitable as dry particle inhalers.\n\n\nAerosols of liquid particles comprising the active compound may be produced by any suitable means, such as with a pressure-driven aerosol nebulizer or an ultrasonic nebulizer. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,501,729, which is incorporated herein by reference. Nebulizers are commercially available devices which transform solutions or suspensions of the active ingredient into a therapeutic aerosol mist either by means of acceleration of compressed gas, typically air or oxygen, through a narrow venturi orifice or by means of ultrasonic agitation. Suitable formulations for use in nebulizers consist of the active ingredient in a liquid carrier, the active ingredient comprising up to 40% w/w of the formulation, but preferably less than 20% w/w. The carrier is typically water (and most preferably sterile, pyrogen-free water) or dilute aqueous alcoholic solution. Perfluorocarbon carriers may also be used. Optional additives include preservatives if the formulation is not made sterile, for example, methyl hydroxybenzoate, antioxidants, flavoring agents, volatile oils, buffering agents and surfactants.\n\n\nAerosols of solid particles comprising the active compound may likewise be produced with any solid particulate medicament aerosol generator. Aerosol generators for administering solid particulate medicaments to a subject produce particles which are respirable, as explained above, and generate a volume of aerosol containing predetermined metered dose of medicament at a rate suitable for human administration. One illustrative type of solid particulate aerosol generator is an insufflator. Suitable formulations for administration by insufflation include finely comminuted powders which may be delivered by means of an insufflator or taken into the nasal cavity in the manner of a snuff. In the insufflator, the powder (e.g., a metered dose thereof effective to carry out the treatments described herein) is contained in capsules or cartridges, typically made of gelatin or plastic, which are either pierced or opened in situ and the powder delivered by air drawn through the device upon inhalation or by means of a manually-operated pump. The powder employed in the insufflator consists either solely of the active ingredient or of powder blend comprising the active ingredient, a suitable powder diluent, such as lactose, and an optional surfactant. The active ingredient typically comprises of 0.1 to 100% w/w of the formulation. A second type of illustrative aerosol generator comprises a metered dose inhaler. Metered dose inhalers are pressurized aerosol dispensers, typically containing a suspension or solution formulation of active ingredient in a liquified propellant. During use, these devices discharge the formulation through a valve adapted to deliver a metered volume, typically from 10 to 150 μl, to produce a fine particle spray containing the active ingredient. Suitable propellants include certain chlorofluorocarbon compounds, for example, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane and mixtures thereof. The formulation may additionally contain one of more co-solvents, for example, ethanol, surfactants, such as oleic acid or sorbitan trioleate, antioxidants and suitable flavoring agents.\n\n\nThe aerosol, whether formed from solid or liquid particles, may be produced by the aerosol generator at a rate of from about 10 to 150 liters per minute, more preferable from 30 to 150 liters per minute, and most preferably about 60 liters per minute. Aerosols containing greater amounts of medicament may be administered more rapidly.\n\n\nThe dosage of the active compounds disclosed herein will vary depending on the condition being treated and the state of the subject, but generally may be from about 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.1 to 1, 5, 10 or 20 mg of the pharmaceutic agent, deposited on the airway surfaces. The daily dose may be divided among one or multiple unit dose administrations. The goal is to achieve a concentration of the pharmaceutic agents on lung airway surfaces of between 10\n−9\n-10\n4 \nM.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, they are administered by administering an aerosol suspension of respirable or non-respirable particles (preferably non-respirable particles) comprised of active compound, which the subject inhales through the nose. The respirable or non respirable particles may be liquid or solid. The quantity of active agent included may b an amount of sufficient to achieve dissolved concentrations of active agent on the airway surfaces of the subject of from about 10\n−9\n, 10\n−8\n, or 10\n−7 \nto about 10\n−3\n, 10\n−2\n, 10\n−1 \nmoles/liter, and more preferably from about 10\n−9 \nto about 10\n−4 \nmoles/liter.\n\n\nThe dosage of active compound will vary depending on the condition being treated and the state of the subject, but generally may be an amount sufficient to achieve dissolved concentrations of active compound on the nasal airway surfaces of the subject from about 10\n−9\n, 10\n−8\n, 10\n−7 \nto about 10\n−3\n, 10\n−2\n, or 10\n−1 \nmoles/liter, and more preferably from about 10\n−7 \nto about 10\n−4 \nmoles/liter. Depending upon the solubility of the particular formulation of active compound administered, the daily dose may be divided among one or several unit dose administrations. The daily dose by weight may range from about 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.5 or 1.0 to 10 or 20 milligrams of active agent particles for a human subject, depending upon the age and condition of the subject. A currently preferred unit dose is about 0.5 milligrams of active agent given at a regimen of 2-10 administrations per day. The dosage may be provided as a prepackaged unit by any suitable means (e.g., encapsulating a gelatin capsule).\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention, the particulate active agent composition may contain both a free base of active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt to provide both early release and sustained release of active agent for dissolution into the mucus secretions of the nose. Such a composition serves to provide both early relief to the patient, and sustained relief over time. Sustained relief, by decreasing the number of daily administrations required, is expected to increase patient compliance with the course of active agent treatments.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations suitable for airway administration include formulations of solutions, emulsions, suspensions and extracts. See generally, J. Nairn, Solutions, Emulsions, Suspensions and Extracts, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, chap. 86 (19\nth \ned. 1995), incorporated herein by reference. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for nasal administration may be prepared as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,389,393 to Schor, 5,707,644 to Illum; 4,294,829 to Suzuki; and 4,835,142 to Suzuki, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.\n\n\nMists or aerosols of liquid particles comprising the active compound may be produced by any suitable means, such as by a simple nasal spray with the active agent in an aqueous pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as a sterile saline solution or sterile water. Administration may be with a pressure-driven aerosol nebulizer or an ultrasonic nebulizer. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,501,729 and 5,656,256, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Suitable formulations for use in a nasal droplet or spray bottle or in nebulizers consist of the active ingredient in a liquid carrier, the active ingredient comprising up to 40% v/v of the formulation, but preferably less than 20% w/w. Typically the carrier is water (and most preferably sterile, pyrogen-free water) or dilute aqueous alcoholic solution, preferably made in a 0.12% to 0.8% solution of sodium chloride. Optional additives include preservatives if the formulation is not made sterile, for example, methyl hydroxybenzoate antioxidants, flavoring agents, volatile oils, buffering agents, osmotically active agents (e.g. mannitol, xylitol, erythritol) and surfactants.\n\n\nCompositions containing respirable or non-respirable dry particles of micronized active agent may be prepared by grinding the dry active agent with a mortar and pestle, and then passing the micronized composition through a 400 mesh screen to break up or separate out large agglomerates.\n\n\nThe particulate composition may optionally contain a dispersant which serves to facilitate the formation of an aerosol. A suitable dispersant is lactose, which may be blended with the active agent in any suitable ratio (e.g., a 1 to 1 ratio by weight).\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) may be synthesized according to procedures known in the art. A representative synthetic procedure is shown in the scheme below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese procedures are described in, for example, E. J. Cragoe, “The Synthesis of Amiloride and Its Analogs” (Chapter 3) in \nAmiloride and Its Analogs\n, pp. 25-36, incorporated herein by reference.

Representative assays are described below.\n\n\n1. In Vitro Measure of Epithelial Sodium Channel Block and Beta Agonist Activity\n\n\nTo assess the potency of epithelial sodium channel block and beta agonist activity each compound was tested using two separate experimental procedures with similar methodology.\n\n\nTo assess epithelial sodium channel blocker potency the compounds of the present invention involves the determination of lumenal drug inhibition of airway epithelial sodium currents measured under short circuit current (I\nSC\n) using airway epithelial monolayers mounted in Ussing chambers. Cells obtained from freshly excised human, or dog airways are seeded onto porous 0.4 micrometer Transwell® Permeable Supports (Corning Inc. Acton, Mass.), cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions in hormonally defined media, and assayed for sodium transport activity (I\nSC\n) while bathed in Krebs Bicarbonate Ringer (KBR) in Ussing chambers. All test drug additions are to the lumenal bath with approximately half-log dose additions (from 1×10\n−11 \nM to 6×10\n−5 \nM), and the cumulative change in I\nSC \n(decreases) recorded. All drugs are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide as stock solutions at a concentration of approximately 1×10\n−2 \nand stored at −20° C. Six preparations are typically run in parallel; one preparation per run incorporates 552-02 as a positive control. Before the start of the concentration-effect relationship propranolol, a non-selective beta agonist blocker, was applied to the lumenal bath (10 μM) to inhibit the beta agonist component of the designer multiple ligand (DML). All data from the voltage clamps are collected via a computer face and analyzed off-line.\n\n\nConcentration-effect relationships for all compounds are considered and analyzed Using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego Calif. USA. IC\n50 \nvalues, maximal effective concentrations, are calculated and compared to the 552-02 potency as a positive control.\n\n\nTo assess beta agonist activity the compounds of the present invention involves the determination of lumenal drug addition to promote airway epithelial anion currents measured under short circuit current (I\nSC\n) using airway epithelial monolayers mounted in Ussing chambers. Cells obtained from freshly excised human, dog, or sheep airways are seeded onto porous 0.4 micron Transwell® Permeable Supports (Corning), cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions in hormonally defined media, and assayed for anion secretion (I\nSC\n) while bathed in Krebs Bicarbonate Ringer (KBR) in Ussing chambers. All test drug additions are to the lumenal bath with approximately half-log dose additions (from 8×10\n−10 \nM to 6.5×10\n−5 \nM), and the cumulative change in I\nSC \n(excitation) recorded. All drugs are prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide as stock solutions at a concentration from 1×10\n−1 \nto 1×10\n−2 \nM and stored at −20° C. Six preparations are typically run in parallel; one preparation per run incorporates either formoterol, salmeterol, or another well recognized beta agonists as a positive control depending on the analog incorporated in the compound being tested. Before the start of the concentration-effect relationship 552-02 a potent sodium channel blocker was applied to the apical surface (1 μM) to eliminate changes in Isc caused by sodium absorption. All data from the voltage clamps are collected via a computer interface and analyzed off-line.\n\n\nConcentration-effect relationships for all compounds are considered and analyzed Using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego Calif. USA. EC\n50 \nvalues, maximal effective concentrations, are calculated and compared to either formoterol or salbutamol as the positive control.\n\n\n2. In Vitro Assay of Compound Absorption and Biotransformation by Airway Epithelia\n\n\nAirway epithelial cells have the capacity to metabolize drugs during the process of transepithelial absorption. Further, although less likely, it is possible that drugs can be metabolized on airway epithelial surfaces by specific ectoenzyme activities. Perhaps more likely as an ecto-surface event, compounds may be metabolized by the infected secretions that occupy the airway lumens of patients with lung disease, e.g. cystic fibrosis. Thus, a series of assays are performed to characterize any compound biotransformation (metabolism or conjugation) that results from the interaction of test compounds with human airway epithelia and/or human airway epithelial lumenal products.\n\n\nIn the first series of assays, the interaction of test compounds in KBR as an “ASL” stimulant are applied to the apical surface of human airway epithelial cells grown in the Transwell® Permeable Supports (Corning), insert system. For most compounds, metabolism or conjugation (generation of new species) is tested for using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to resolve chemical species and the endogenous fluorescence properties of these compounds to estimate the relative quantities of test compound and novel metabolites. For a typical assay, a test solution (1 mL KBR, containing 100 μM test compound) is placed on the epithelial lumenal surface. Sequential 5 to 600 μl samples are obtained from the lumenal and serosal compartments respectively for HPLC analysis of (1) the mass of test compound permeating from the lumenal to serosal bath and (2) the potential formation of metabolites from the parent compound. From the HPLC data, the rate of and/or formation of novel metabolite compounds on the lumenal surface and the appearance of test compound and/or novel metabolite in the basolateral solution is quantitated based on internal standards. The data relating the chromatographic mobility of potential novel metabolites with reference to the parent compound are also quantitated.\n\n\nTo analyze the potential metabolism of test compounds by CF sputum, a “representative” mixture of expectorated CF sputum obtained from 10 CF patients (under IRB approval) has been collected. The sputum has been be solubilized in a 1:5 mixture of KBR solution with vigorous vortexing, following which the mixture was split into a “neat” sputum aliquot and an aliquot subjected to ultracentrifugation so that a “supernatant” aliquot was obtained (neat=cellular; supernatant=liquid phase). Typical studies of compound metabolism by CF sputum involve the addition of known masses of test compound to “neat” CF sputum and aliquots of CF sputum “supernatant” incubated at 37° C., followed by sequential sampling of aliquots from each sputum type for characterization of compound stability/metabolism by HPLC analysis as described above. As above, analysis of compound disappearance, rates of formation of novel metabolites, and HPLC mobilities of novel metabolites are then performed.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nHaving generally described this invention, a further understanding can be obtained by reference to certain specific examples which are provided herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified.\n\n\nPreparation of Sodium Channel Blockers with Beta Agonist Activity\n\n\nMaterials and Methods.

The heads of the animals were immobilized, and local anesthesia of the nasal passage was provided (2% lidocaine) prior to nasal intubation (7.5 mm-I.D. endotracheal tube (ETT) (Mallinckrodt Medical, St. Louis, Mo.). The cuff of the ETT was placed just below the vocal cords. After intubation, the animals were allowed to equilibrate for approximately 20 min before MCC measurements began.\n\n\nSheep MCC in vivo Measurement: Aerosols of sulfur colloid radiolabeled with technetium (\n99m\nTc—SC 3.1 mg/mL, ˜10-15 mCi) were generated by a Raindrop Nebulizer (Nellcor Puritan Bennett, Pleasanton, Calif.) which produces a median aerodynamic droplet diameter of 3.6 μm. The nebulizer was connected to a dosimeter system consisting of a solenoid valve and a source of compressed air (20 psi). The output of the nebulizer was directed into a T piece, with one end attached to a respirator (Harvard apparatus, South Natick, Mass.). The system was activated for 1 second at the onset of the respirator's inspiratory cycle. The tidal volume was set at 300 mL, with an inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio of 1:1, and a rate of 20 breaths/min, to maximize central airway deposition. The sheep breathed the \n99m\nTc—SC aerosol for up to 5 min. Following tracer deposition, a gamma camera was used to measure the clearance of \n99m\nTc—SC from the airways. The camera was positioned above the animal's back with the sheep in its natural upright position in the harness. The field of the image was perpendicular to the animal's spinal cord. External radiolabeled markers were placed on the sheep to facilitate proper alignment of the gamma camera. A region of interest was traced over the image corresponding to the right lung of the sheep and counts were recorded. The counts were corrected for decay and expressed as a percentage of radioactivity present in the baseline image. The left lung was excluded from the analysis because the outline of the lung was superimposed over the stomach and counts could be affected by swallowed \n99m\nTc—SC-labeled mucus. Alt deposition images were stored on a computer interfaced to the gamma camera. The protocol included a baseline deposition image obtained immediately post radio-aerosol administration. After acquisition of baseline images, either 4 mL of H\n2\nO (vehicle), formoterol (3 mM), or novel chemical entity (3 mM) were aerosolized using the Pari LC JetPlus nebulizer to free-breathing sheep using two separate protocols. Protocol 1, acquired data immediately after dosing (time 0 to 1 hour), and indicated the immediate physiological response ‘short-term efficacy’ protocol 2, acquired data 4 hours post dosing indicated compound durability and ‘long-term efficacy’. The nebulizer had a flow rate of 8 L/min and the time to deliver the solution was 10-12 min. On the completion of compound administration, the animal was immediately extubated to prevent false elevations in counts due to aspiration of excess \n99m\nTc—SC-labeled mucus from the ETT. Serial measurements of \n99m\nTc—SC retained in the lung were obtained over a 1 hour period at 5 min intervals. A washout period of at least 7 days (half life of \n99m\nTC=6 h) separated studies with the different agents.\n\n\nStatistical Analysis: Data from the in vivo sheep MCC assays were analyzed using a two way ANOVA with repeated measures, followed by slope analysis of the linear regression of the retention vs time plot using an ANOCOVA to compare slopes, and if needed a multiple comparison test (Newman-Keuls). The percent activity retained (post 4 hours was calculated by dividing the slope value from protocol 2 by the slope value obtained in protocol 1 and multiplying by 100%.\n\n\nAnimal Preparation: Adult ewes (ranging in weight from 25 to 35 kg) were restrained in an upright position in a specialized body harness adapted to a modified shopping cart. The animals' heads were immobilized and local anesthesia of the nasal passage was induced with 2% lidocaine. The animals were then nasally intubated with a 7.5 mm internal diameter endotracheal tube (ETT). The cuff of the ETT was placed just below the vocal cords and its position was verified with a flexible bronchoscope. After intubation the animals were allowed to equilibrate for approximately 20 minutes prior to initiating measurements of mucociliary clearance.\n\n\nAdministration of Radio-aerosol: Aerosols of \n99m\nTc-Human serum albumin (3.1 mg/ml; containing approximately 20 mCi) were generated using a Raindrop Nebulizer which produces a droplet with a median aerodynamic diameter of 3.6 μm. The nebulizer was connected to a dosimetry system consisting of a solenoid valve and a source of compressed air (20 psi). The output of the nebulizer was directed into a plastic T connector; one end of which was connected to the endotracheal tube, the other was connected to a piston respirator. The system was activated for one second at the onset of the respirator's inspiratory cycle. The respirator was set at a tidal volume of 500 mL, an inspiratory to expiratory ratio of 1:1, and at a rate of 20 breaths per minute to maximize the central airway deposition. The sheep breathed the radio-labeled aerosol for 5 minutes. A gamma camera was used to measure the clearance of \n99m\nTc-Human serum albumin from the airways. The camera was positioned above the animal=s back with the sheep in a natural upright position supported in a cart so that the field of image was perpendicular to the animal=s spinal cord. External radio-labeled markers were placed on the sheep to ensure proper alignment under the gamma camera. All images were stored in a computer integrated with the gamma camera. A region of interest was traced over the image corresponding to the right lung of the sheep and the counts were recorded. The counts were corrected for decay and expressed as percentage of radioactivity present in the initial baseline image. The left lung was excluded from the analysis because its outlines are superimposed over the stomach and counts can be swallowed and enter the stomach as radio-labeled mucus.\n\n\nTreatment Protocol (Assessment of activity at t-zero): A baseline deposition image was obtained immediately after radio-aerosol administration. At time zero, after acquisition of the baseline image, vehicle control (distilled water), positive control (amiloride), or experimental compounds were aerosolized from a 4 ml volume using a Pari LC JetPlus nebulizer to free-breathing animals. The nebulizer was driven by compressed air with a flow of 8 liters per minute. The time to deliver the solution was 10 to 12 minutes. Animals were extubated immediately following delivery of the total dose in order to prevent false elevations in counts caused by aspiration of excess radio-tracer from the ETT. Serial images of the lung were obtained at 15-minute intervals during the first 2 hours after dosing and hourly for the next 6 hours after dosing for a total observation period of 8 hours. A washout period of at least 7 days separated dosing sessions with different experimental agents.\n\n\nTreatment Protocol (Assessment of Activity at t-4 hours): The following variation of the standard protocol was used to assess the durability of response following a single exposure to vehicle control (distilled water), positive control compounds (amiloride or benzamil), or investigational agents. At time zero, vehicle control (distilled water), positive control (amiloride), or investigational compounds were aerosolized from a 4 ml volume using a Pari LC JetPlus nebulizer to free-breathing animals. The nebulizer was driven by compressed air with a flow of 8 liters per minute. The time to deliver the solution was 10 to 12 minutes. Animals were restrained in an upright position in a specialized body harness for 4 hours. At the end of the 4-hour period animals received a single dose of aerosolized \n99m\nTc-Human serum albumin (3.1 mg/ml; containing approximately 20 mCi) from a Raindrop Nebulizer. Animals were extubated immediately following delivery of the total dose of radio-tracer. A baseline deposition image was obtained immediately after radio-aerosol administration. Serial images of the lung were obtained at 15-minute intervals during the first 2 hours after administration of the radio-tracer (representing hours 4 through 6 after drug administration) and hourly for the next 2 hours after dosing for a total observation period of 4 hours. A washout period of at least 7 days separated dosing sessions with different experimental agents.\n\n\nStatistics: Data were analyzed using SYSTAT for Windows, version 5. Data were analyzed using a two-way repeated ANOVA to assess overall effects), followed by a paired t-test to identify differences between specific pairs. Significance was accepted when P was less than or equal to 0.05. Slope values (calculated from data collected during the initial 45 minutes after dosing in the t-zero assessment) for mean MCC curves were calculated using linear least square regression to assess differences in the initial rates during the rapid clearance phase.\n\n\n\nObviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein."

Description\n\n\n\n\nThe present invention relates to novel heteroaryl substituted benzothiazole derivatives and therapeutic uses for such compounds. Furthermore, the invention relates to novel heteroaryl substituted benzothiazole derivatives that are suitable for imaging amyloid deposits in living patients, their compositions, methods of use and processes to make such compounds. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method of imaging amyloid deposits in brain in vivo to allow antemortem diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease as well as measuring clinical efficacy of Alzheimer's disease therapeutic agents.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nAmyloidosis is a progressive, incurable metabolic disease of unknown cause characterized by abnormal deposits of protein in one or more organs or body systems. Amyloid proteins are manufactured, for example, by malfunctioning bone marrow. Amyloidosis, which occurs when accumulated amyloid deposits impair normal body function, can cause organ failure or death. It is a rare disease, occurring in about eight of every 1,000,000 people. It affects males and females equally and usually develops after the age of 40. At least 15 types of amyloidosis have been identified. Each one is associated with deposits of a different kind of protein.\n\n\nThe major forms of amyloidosis are primary systemic, secondary, and familial or hereditary amyloidosis. There is also another form of amyloidosis associated with Alzheimer's disease. Primary systemic amyloidosis usually develops between the ages of 50 and 60. With about 2,000 new cases diagnosed annually, primary systemic amyloidosis is the most common form of this disease in the United States. Also known as light-chain-related amyloidosis, it may also occur in association with multiple myeloma (bone marrow cancer). Secondary amyloidosis is a result of chronic infection or inflammatory disease. It is often associated with Familial Mediterranean fever (a bacterial infection characterized by chills, weakness, headache, and recurring fever), Granulomatous ileitis (inflammation of the small intestine), Hodgkin's disease, Leprosy, Osteomyelitis and Rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nFamilial or hereditary amyloidosis is the only inherited form of the disease. It occurs in members of most ethnic groups, and each family has a distinctive pattern of symptoms and organ involvement. Hereditary amyloidosis is though to be autosomal dominant, which means that only one copy of the defective gene is necessary to cause the disease. A child of a parent with familial amyloidosis has a 50-50 risk of developing the disease.\n\n\nAmyloidosis can involve any organ or system in the body. The heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal system, and nervous system are affected most often. Other common sites of amyloid accumulation include the brain, joints, liver, spleen, pancreas, respiratory system, and skin.\n\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, a neurologic disease characterized by loss of mental ability severe enough to interfere with normal activities of daily living, lasting at least six months, and not present from birth. AD usually occurs in old age, and is marked by a decline in cognitive functions such as remembering, reasoning, and planning.\n\n\nBetween two and four million Americans have AD; that number is expected to grow to as many as 14 million by the middle of the 21st century as the population as a whole ages. While a small number of people in their 40 s and 50 s develop the disease, AD predominantly affects the elderly. AD affects about 3% of all people between ages 65 and 74, about 20% of those between 75 and 84, and about 50% of those over 85. Slightly more women than men are affected with AD, even when considering women tend to live longer, and so there is a higher proportion of women in the most affected age groups.\n\n\nThe accumulation of amyloid Aβ-peptide in the brain is a pathological hallmark of all forms of AD. It is generally accepted that deposition of cerebral amyloid Aβ-peptide is the primary influence driving AD pathogenesis. (Hardy J and Selkoe D. J., Science. 297: 353-356, 2002).\n\n\nImaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), are effective in monitoring the accumulation of amyloid deposits in the brain and correlating it to the progression of AD (Shoghi-Jadid et al. The American journal of geriatric psychiatry 2002, 10, 24; Miller, Science, 2006, 313, 1376; Coimbra et al. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2006, 6, 629; Nordberg, Lancet Neurol. 2004, 3, 519). The application of these techniques requires the development of radioligands that readily enter the brain and selectively bind to amyloid deposits in vivo.\n\n\nA need exists for amyloid binding compounds that are non-toxic and can cross the blood-brain barrier, and consequently, can be used in diagnostics. Furthermore, it is important to be able to monitor the efficacy of the treatment given to AD patients, by measuring the effect of said treatment by measuring changes of AD plaque level.\n\n\nProperties of particular interest of a detectable amyloid binding compound, besides high affinity for amyloid deposits in vivo and high and rapid brain entrance, include low unspecific binding to normal tissue and rapid clearance from the same. These properties are commonly dependant on the lipophilicity of the compound (Coimbra et al. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2006, 6, 629). Based partly on the relatively higher clearance from normal brain tissue as compared to related analogues, [\n11\nC]PIB was selected from amongst these for further evaluations in human subjects (Mathis et al. J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46, 2740). Subsequently, a study on the use of [\n11\nC]PIB for the detection of amyloid deposits in-vivo in the human by the PET-technique was conducted (Klunk et al. Ann Neurol. 2004, 55, 306). In this study, significant higher retention of [\n11\nC]PIB in relevant regions of the brain, was observed in subjects with diagnosed AD as compared to healthy controls. Related methods and derivatives are described in WO 2002/16333 and WO 2004/083195.\n\n\nThere is a need for improved compounds in order to obtain a signal-to-noise ratio high enough to allow detailed detection of amyloid deposits throughout all brain regions, and providing improved reliability in quantiative studies on amyloid plaque load in relation to drug treatments.\n\n\nThe present invention provides heteroaryl substituted benzothiazole derivatives that carry such unexpected improvements over known benzothiazole derivatives providing inter alia advantageously associated low unspecific binding and rapid brain clearance.\n\n\nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides methods for measuring effects of amyloid binding compounds, by measuring changes of AD plaque

For example “C\n1-6 \nalkyl” denotes alkyl having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbon atoms. When the specific number denoting the alkyl-group is the integer 0 (zero), a hydrogen-atom is intended as the substituent at the position of the alkyl-group. For example, “N(C\n0 \nalkyl)\n2\n” is equivalent to “NH\n2\n” (amino). When the specific number denoting the alkylenyl or alkylene-group is the integer 0 (zero), a bond is intended to link the groups onto which the alkylenyl or alkylene-group is substituted. For example, “NH(C\n0 \nalkylene)NH\n2\n” is equivalent to “NHNH\n2\n” (hydrazino). As used herein, the groups linked by an alkylene or alkylenyl-group are intended to be attached to the first and to the last carbon of the alkylene or alkylenyl-group. In the case of methylene, the first and the last carbon is the same. For example, “N(C\n4 \nalkylene)”, “N(C\n5 \nalkylene)” and “N(C\n2 \nalkylene)\n2\nNH” is equivalent to pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl and piperazinyl, respectively.\n\n\nExamples of alkyl include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, pentyl, and hexyl.\n\n\nExamples of alkylene or alkylenyl include, but are not limited to, methylene, ethylene, propylene, and butylene.\n\n\nAs used herein, “alkoxy” or “alkyloxy” represents an alkyl group as defined above with the indicated number of carbon atoms attached through an oxygen bridge. Examples of alkoxy include, but are not limited to, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, isobutoxy, t-butoxy, n-pentoxy, isopentoxy, cyclopropylmethoxy, allyloxy and propargyloxy. Similarly, “alkylthio” or “thioalkoxy” represent an alkyl group as defined above with the indicated number of carbon atoms attached through a sulphur bridge.\n\n\nAs used herein, “fluoroalkyl”, “fluoroallklene” and “fluoroalkoxy”, used alone or as a suffix or prefix, refers to groups in which one, two, or three of the hydrogen(s) attached to the carbon(s) of the corresponding alkyl, alkylene and alkoxy-groups are replaced by fluoro. Examples of fluoroalkyl include, but are not limited to, trifluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, fluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 2-fluoroethyl and 3-fluoropropyl.\n\n\nExamples of fluoroalkylene include, but are not limited to, difluoromethylene, fluoromethylene, 2,2-difluorobutylene and 2,2,3-trifluorobutylene.\n\n\nExamples of fluoroalkoxy include, but are not limited to, trifluoromethoxy, 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy, 3,3,3-trifluoropropoxy and 2,2-difluoropropoxy.\n\n\nAs used herein, “aromatic” refers to hydrocarbonyl groups having one or more unsaturated carbon ring(s) having aromatic characters, (e.g. 4n+2 delocalized electrons) and comprising up to about 14 carbon atoms. In addition “heteroaromatic” refers to groups having one or more unsaturated rings containing carbon and one or more heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur having aromatic character (e.g. 4n+2 delocalized electrons).\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “aryl” refers to an aromatic ring structure made up of from 5 to 14 carbon atoms. Ring structures containing 5, 6, 7 and 8 carbon atoms would be single-ring aromatic groups, for example, phenyl. Ring structures containing 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 would be polycyclic, for example naphthyl. The aromatic ring can be substituted at one or more ring positions with such substituents as described above. The term “aryl” also includes polycyclic ring systems having two or more cyclic rings in which two or more carbons are common to two adjoining rings (the rings are “fused rings”) wherein at least one of the rings is aromatic, for example, the other cyclic rings can be cycloalkyls, cycloalkenyls, cycloalkynyls, aryls and/or heterocyclyls. The terms ortho, meta and para apply to 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-disubstituted benzenes, respectively. For example, the \nnames\n 1,2-dimethylbenzene and ortho-dimethylbenzene are synonymous.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “cycloalkyl” is intended to include saturated ring groups, having the specified number of carbon atoms. These may include fused or bridged polycyclic systems. Preferred cycloalkyls have from 3 to 10 carbon atoms in their ring structure, and more preferably have 3, 4, 5, and 6 carbons in the ring structure. For example, “C\n3-6 \ncycloalkyl” denotes such groups as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, or cyclohexyl.\n\n\nAs used herein, “halo” or “halogen” refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo. “Counterion” is used, for example, to represent a small, negatively charged species such as chloride, bromide, hydroxide, acetate, sulfate, tosylate, benezensulfonate, and the like.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “heterocyclyl” or “heterocyclic” or “heterocycle” refers to a saturated, unsaturated or partially saturated, monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic ring (unless otherwise stated) containing 3 to 20 atoms of which 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 ring atoms are chosen from nitrogen, sulphur or oxygen, which may, unless otherwise specified, be carbon or nitrogen linked, wherein a —CH\n2\n— group is optionally be replaced by a —C(O)—; and where unless stated to the contrary a ring nitrogen or sulphur atom is optionally oxidised to form the N-oxide or S-oxide(s) or a ring nitrogen is optionally quarternized; wherein a ring —NH is optionally substituted by acetyl, formyl, methyl or mesyl; and a ring is optionally substituted by one or more halo. It is understood that when the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocyclyl exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. If the said heterocyclyl group is bi- or tricyclic then at least one of the rings may optionally be a heteroaromatic or aromatic ring provided that at least one of the rings is non-heteroaromatic. If the said heterocyclyl group is monocyclic then it must not be aromatic. Examples of heterocyclyls include, but are not limited to, piperidinyl, N-acetylpiperidinyl, N-methylpiperidinyl, N-formylpiperazinyl, N-mesylpiperazinyl, homopiperazinyl, piperazinyl, azetidinyl, oxetanyl, morpholinyl, tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, tetrahydroquinolinyl, indolinyl, tetrahydropyranyl, dihydro-2H-pyranyl, tetrahydrofuranyl and 2,5-dioxoimidazolidinyl.\n\n\nAs used herein, “heteroaryl” refers to a heteroaromatic heterocycle having at least one heteroatom ring member such as sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen. Heteroaryl groups include monocyclic and polycyclic (e.g., having 2, 3 or 4 fused rings) systems. Examples of heteroaryl groups include without limitation, pyridyl (i.e., pyridinyl), pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, triazinyl, furyl (i.e. furanyl), quinolyl, isoquinolyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, indolyl, pyrryl, oxazolyl, benzofuryl, benzothienyl, benzthiazolyl, isoxazolyl, pyrazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, indazolyl, 1,2,4-thiadiazolyl, isothiazolyl, benzothienyl, purinyl, carbazolyl, benzimidazolyl, indolinyl, and the like. In some embodiments, the heteroaryl group has from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, and in further embodiments from about 3 to about 20 carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the heteroaryl group contains 3 to about 14, 4 to about 14, 3 to about 7, or 5 to 6 ring-forming atoms. In some embodiments, the heteroaryl group has 1 to about 4, 1 to about 3, or 1 to 2 heteroatoms. In some embodiments, the heteroaryl group has 1 heteroatom.\n\n\nAs used herein, the phrase “protecting group” or “protective group” means temporary substituents which protect a potentially reactive functional group from undesired chemical transformations. Examples of such protecting groups include esters of carboxylic acids, silyl ethers of alcohols, and acetals and ketals of aldehydes and ketones respectively. A sub-group of protecting groups are those which protect a nucleophilic hydroxy group against alkylation and thus permit selective N-alkylation of an amino-group present in the same molecule under basic conditions. Examples of such protecting groups include, but is not limited to, methyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl, alkoxymethyl and t-butyldimethylsilyl.\n\n\nAs used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, phosphoric, and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as lactic, maleic, citric, benzoic, methanesulfonic, and the like.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are used.\n\n\nAs used herein, “in vivo hydrolysable precursors” means an in vivo hydrolysable (or cleavable) ester of a compound of formula I that contains a carboxy or a hydroxy group. For example amino acid esters, C\n1-6 \nalkoxymethyl esters like methoxymethyl; C\n1-6\nalkanoyloxymethyl esters like pivaloyloxymethyl; C\n3-8\ncycloalkoxycarbonyloxy C\n1-6\nalkyl esters like 1-cyclohexylcarbonyloxyethyl, acetoxymethoxy, or phosphoramidic cyclic esters.\n\n\nAs used herein, “tautomer” means other structural isomers that exist in equilibrium resulting from the migration of a hydrogen atom. For example, keto-enol tautomerism where the resulting compound has the properties of both a ketone and an unsaturated alcohol.\n\n\nAs used herein “stable compound” and “stable structure” are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic or diagnostic agent.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention further include hydrates and solvates.\n\n\nThe present invention includes isotopically labeled compounds of the invention. An “isotopically-labeled”, “radio-labeled”, “labeled”, “detectable” or “detectable amyloid binding” compound, or a “radioligand” is a compound of the invention where one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature (i.e., naturally occurring). Suitable radionuclides (i.e. “detectable isotopes”) that may be incorporated in compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to \n2\nH (also written as D for deuterium), \n3\nH (also written as T for tritium), \n11\nC, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n13\nN, \n15\nN, \n15\nO, \n17\nO, \n18\nO, \n18\nF, \n35\nS, \n36\nCl, \n82\nBr, \n75\nBr, \n76\nBr, \n77\nBr, \n123\nI, \n124\nI, \n125\nI and \n131\nI. It is to be understood that an isotopically labeled compound of the invention need only to be enriched with a detectable isotop to, or above, the degree which allows detection with a technique suitable for the particular application, e.g. in a detectable compound of the invention labeled with \n11\nC, the carbon-atom of the labeled group of the labeled compound may be constituted by \n12\nC or other carbon-isotopes in a fraction of the molecules. The radionuclide that is incorporated in the instant radiolabeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that radiolabeled compound. For example, for in vitro plaque or receptor labeling and competition assays, compounds that incorporate \n3\nH, \n14\nC, or \n125\nI will generally be most useful. For in vivo imaging applications \n11\nC, \n13\nC, \n18\nF, \n19\nF, \n120\nI, \n123\nI, \n131\nI, \n75\nBr, or \n76\nBr will generally be most useful.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the invention the radionuclides are represented by \n3\nH, \n18\nF, \n19\nF, \n11\nC, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n75\nBr, \n76\nBr, \n120\nI, \n123\nI, \n125\nI or \n131\nI.\n\n\nExamples of an “effective amount” include amounts that enable imaging of amyloid deposit(s) in vivo, that yield acceptable toxicity and bioavailability levels for pharmaceutical use, and/or prevent cell degeneration and toxicity associated with fibril formation.\n\n\nThis invention provides radiolabeled heteroaryl substituted benzothiazoles as amyloid imaging agents and synthetic precursor compounds from which such are prepared.\n\n\nIt is believed that the compounds of the present invention may be used for the treatment of Alzheimer disease. Hence, compounds of the present invention and their salts are expected to be active against age-related diseases such as Alzheimer, as well as other AD related pathologies such as Downs syndrome and β-amyloid angiopathy. It is expected that the compounds of the present invention would most likely be used as single agents but could also be used in combination with a broad range of cognition deficit enhancement agents.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition or formulation comprising a compound of formula (I) is administered concurrently, simultaneously, sequentially or separately with another pharmaceutically active compound or compounds used in Alzheimer's therapies including for example donepezil, memantine, tacrine and equivalents and pharmaceutically active isomer(s) and metabolite(s) thereof.\n\n\nMethods of Use\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may be used to determine the presence, location and/or amount of one or more amyloid deposit(s) in an organ or body area, including the brain, of an animal. Amyloid deposit(s) include, without limitation, deposit(s) of Aβ. In allowing the temporal sequence of amyloid deposition to be followed, the inventive compounds may further be used to correlate amyloid deposition with the onset of clinical symptoms associated with a disease, disorder or condition. The inventive compounds may ultimately be used to treat, and to diagnose a disease, disorder or condition characterized by amyloid deposition, such as AD, familial AD, Down's syndrome, amyloidosis and homozygotes for the apolipoprotein E4 allele.\n\n\nThe method of this invention determines the presence and location of amyloid deposits in an organ or body area, preferably brain, of a patient. The present method comprises administration of a detectable quantity of a pharmaceutical composition containing an amyloid-binding compound of the present invention called a “detectable compound,” or a pharmaceutically acceptable water-soluble salt thereof, to a patient. A “detectable quantity” means that the amount of the detectable compound that is administered is sufficient to enable detection of binding of the compound to amyloid. An “imaging effective quantity” means that the amount of the detectable compound that is administered is sufficient to enable imaging of binding of the compound to amyloid.\n\n\nThe invention employs amyloid probes which, in conjunction with non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) or imaging (MINI), or gamma imaging such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), are used to quantify amyloid deposition in vivo. The term “in vivo imaging” refers to any method which permits the detection of a labeled heteroaryl substituted benzothiazole derivative as described herein. For gamma imaging, the radiation emitted from the organ or area being examined is measured and expressed either as total binding or as a ratio in which total binding in one tissue is normalized to (for example, divided by) the total binding in another tissue of the same subject during the same in vivo imaging procedure. Total binding in vivo is defined as the entire signal detected in a tissue by an in vivo imaging technique without the need for correction by a second injection of an identical quantity of labeled compound along with a large excess of unlabeled, but otherwise chemically identical compound. A “subject” is a mammal, preferably a human, and most preferably a human suspected of having dementia.\n\n\nFor purposes of in vivo imaging, the type of detection instrument available is a major factor in selecting a given label. For instance, radioactive isotopes and \n19\nF are particularly suitable for in vivo imaging in the methods of the present invention. The type of instrument used will guide the selection of the radionuclide or stable isotope. For instance, the radionuclide chosen must have a type of decay detectable by a given type of instrument.\n\n\nAnother consideration relates to the half-life of the radionuclide. The half-life should be long enough so that it is still detectable at the time of maximum uptake by the target, but short enough so that the host does not sustain deleterious radiation. The radiolabeled compounds of the invention can be detected using gamma imaging wherein emitted gamma irradiation of the appropriate wavelength is detected. Methods of gamma imaging include, but are not limited to, SPECT and PET. Preferably, for SPECT detection, the chosen radiolabel will lack a particulate emission, but will produce a large number of photons in a 140-200 keV range.\n\n\nFor PET detection, the radiolabel will be a positron-emitting radionuclide such as \n18\nF which will annihilate to form two 511 keV gamma rays which will be detected by the PET camera.\n\n\nIn the present invention, amyloid binding compounds/probes are made which are useful for in vivo imaging and quantification of amyloid deposition. These compounds are to be used in conjunction with non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) or imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In accordance with this invention, the heteroaryl substituted benzothiazole derivatives may be labeled with \n19\nF or \n13\nC for MRS/MRI by general organic chemistry techniques known in the art. The compounds may also be radiolabeled with \n18\nF, \n11\nC, \n75\nBr, \n76\nBr, or \n120\nI for PET by techniques well known in the art and are described by Fowler, J. and Wolf, A. in POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY AND AUTORADIOGRAPHY 391-450 (Raven Press, 1986). The compounds also may be radiolabeled with \n123\nI and \n131\nI for SPECT by any of several techniques known to the art. See, e.g., Kulkarni, Int. J. Rad. Appl. & Inst. (Part B) 18: 647 (1991). The compounds may also be radiolabeled with known metal radiolabels, such as Technetium-99m (\n99m\nTc). Modification of the substituents to introduce ligands that bind such metal ions can be effected without undue experimentation by one of ordinary skill in the radiolabeling art. The metal radiolabeled compound can then be used to detect amyloid deposits. Preparing radiolabeled derivatives of Tc-99m is well known in the art. See, for example, Zhuang et al. Nuclear Medicine & Biology 26(2):217-24, (1999); Oya et al. Nuclear Medicine & Biology 25(2):135-40, (1998), and Hom et al. Nuclear Medicine & Biology 24(6):485-98, (1997). In addition, the compounds may be labeled with \n3\nH, \n14\nC and 125, by methods well known to the one skilled in the art, for detection of amyloid plaque in in vitro and post mortem samples.\n\n\nThe methods of the present invention may use isotopes detectable by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for purposes of in vivo imaging and spectroscopy. Elements particularly useful in magnetic resonance spectroscopy include \n19\nF and \n13\nC.\n\n\nSuitable radioisotopes for purposes of this invention include beta-emitters, gamma-emitters, positron-emitters, and x-ray emitters. These radioisotopes include \n120\nI, \n123\nI, \n131\nI, \n125\nI, \n18\nF, \n11\nC, \n75\nBr, and \n76\nBr. Suitable stable isotopes for use in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Spectroscopy (MRS), according to this invention, include \n19\nF and \n13\nC. Suitable radioisotopes for in vitro quantification of amyloid in homogenates of biopsy or post-mortem tissue include \n125\nI, \n14\nC, and \n3\nH. The preferred radiolabels are \n11\nC or \n18\nF for use in PET in vivo imaging, \n123\nI for use in SPECT imaging, \n19\nF for MRS/MRI, and \n3\nH or \n14\nC for in vitro studies. However, any conventional method for visualizing diagnostic probes can be utilized in accordance with this invention.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may be administered by any means known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, administration to the animal may be local or systemic and accomplished orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally, or via an implanted reservoir. The term “parenteral” as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intrasternal, intracranial, and intraosseous injection and infusion techniques.\n\n\nThe exact administration protocol will vary depending upon various factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the determination of specific administration procedures would be routine to an one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\nDose levels on the order of about 0.001 μg/kg/day to about 10,000 mg/kg/day of an is inventive compound are useful for the inventive methods. In one embodiment, the dose level is about 0.001 μg/kg/day to about 10 g/kg/day. In another embodiment, the dose level is about 0.01 μg/kg/day to about 1.0 g/kg/day. In yet another embodiment, the dose level is about 0.1 mg/kg/day to about 100 mg/kg/day.\n\n\nThe specific dose level for any particular patient will vary depending upon various factors, including the activity and the possible toxicity of the specific compound employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration; the rate of excretion; the drug combination; and the form of administration. Typically, in vitro dosage-effect results provide useful guidance on the proper doses for patient administration. Studies in animal models are also helpful. The considerations for determining the proper dose levels are well known in the art and within the skills of an ordinary physician.\n\n\nAny known administration regimen for regulating the timing and sequence of drug delivery may be used and repeated as necessary to effect treatment in the inventive methods.\n\n\nThe regimen may include pretreatment and/or co-administration with additional therapeutic agent(s).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the inventive compounds are administered to a mammal, including man, that is suspected of having or that is at risk of developing a disease, disorder or condition characterized by amyloid deposition. For example, the animal may be an elderly human.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, compounds and methods for their preparation, useful as precursors, are provided. Such precursors may be used as synthetic starting materials for the incorporation of labeled molecular fragments leading to radiolabeled heteroaryl substituted benzothiazoles as amyloid imaging agents.\n\n\nMethod for Detecting Amyloid Deposits In Vitro\n\n\nThis invention further provides a method for detecting amyloid deposit(s) in vitro comprising: (i) contacting a bodily tissue with an effective amount of an inventive compound, wherein the compound would bind any amyloid deposit(s) in the tissue; and (ii) detecting binding of the compound to amyloid deposit(s) in the tissue.\n\n\nThe binding may be detected by any means known in the art. Examples of detection means include, without limitation, microscopic techniques, such as bright-field, fluorescence, laser-confocal and cross-polarization microscopy.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nThis invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising: (i) an effective amount of at least one inventive compound; and (ii) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\nThe composition may comprise one or more additional pharmaceutically acceptable ingredient(s), including without limitation one or more wetting agent(s), buffering agent(s), suspending agent(s), lubricating agent(s), emulsifier(s), disintegrant(s), absorbent(s), preservative(s), surfactant(s), colorant(s), flavorant(s), sweetener(s) and therapeutic agent(s).\n\n\nThe composition may be formulated into solid, liquid, gel or suspension form for: (1) oral administration as, for example, a drench (aqueous or non-aqueous solution or suspension), tablet (for example, targeted for buccal, sublingual or systemic absorption), bolus, powder, granule, paste for application to the tongue, hard gelatin capsule, soft gelatin capsule, mouth spray, emulsion and microemulsion; (2) parenteral administration by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or epidural injection as, for example, a sterile solution, suspension or sustained-release formulation; (3) topical application as, for example, a cream, ointment, controlled-release patch or spray applied to the skin; (4) intravaginal or intrarectal administration as, for example, a pessary, cream or foam; (5) sublingual administration; (6) ocular administration; (7) transdermal administration; or (8) nasal administration.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the composition is formulated for intravenous administration and the carrier includes a fluid and/or a nutrient replenisher. In another embodiment, the composition is capable of binding specifically to amyloid in vivo, is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, is non-toxic at appropriate dose levels and/or has a satisfactory duration of effect. In yet another embodiment, the composition comprises about 10 mg of human serum albumin and from about 0.0005 to 500 mg of a compound of the present invention per mL of phosphate buffer containing NaCl.\n\n\nThe present invention further provides compositions comprising a compound of formula I, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient.\n\n\nThe present invention further provides methods of treating or preventing an AD-related pathology in a patient, comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I.\n\n\nThe present invention further provides a compound of formula I for use as a medicament.\n\n\nThe present invention further provides a compound of formula I for the manufacture of a medicament.\n\n\nSome compounds of formula I may have stereogenic centres and/or geometric isomeric centres (E- and Z-isomers), and it is to be understood that the invention encompasses all such optical isomers, enantiomers, diastereoisomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers.\n\n\nThe present invention relates to the use of compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined as well as to the salts thereof. Salts for use in pharmaceutical compositions will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, but other salts may be useful in the production of the compounds of formula I.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention can be used as medicaments. In some embodiments, the present invention provides compounds of formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, tautomers or in vivo-hydrolysable precursors thereof, for use as medicaments.

Throughout the following description of such processes it is to be understood that, where appropriate, suitable protecting groups will be added to, and subsequently removed from, the various reactants and intermediates in a manner that will be readily understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Conventional procedures for using such protecting groups as well as is examples of suitable protecting groups are described, for example, in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, T. W. Green, P. G. M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience, New York, (1999). It is also to be understood that a transformation of a group or substituent into another group or substituent by chemical manipulation can be conducted on any intermediate or final product on the synthetic path toward the final product, in which the possible type of transformation is limited only by inherent incompatibility of other functionalities carried by the molecule at that stage to the conditions or reagents employed in the transformation. Such inherent incompatibilities, and ways to circumvent them by carrying out appropriate transformations and synthetic steps in a suitable order, will be readily understood to the one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Examples of transformations are given below, and it is to be understood that the described transformations are not limited only to the generic groups or substituents for which the transformations are exemplified. References and descriptions on other suitable transformations are given in “Comprehensive Organic Transformations—A Guide to Functional Group Preparations” R. C. Larock, VHC Publishers, Inc. (1989). References and descriptions of other suitable reactions are described in textbooks of organic chemistry, for example, “Advanced Organic Chemistry”, March 4th ed. McGraw Hill (1992) or, “Organic Synthesis”, Smith, McGraw Hill, (1994). Techniques for purification of intermediates and final products include for example, straight and reversed phase chromatography on column or rotating plate, recrystallisation, distillation and liquid-liquid or solid-liquid extraction, which will be readily understood by the one skilled in the art. The definitions of substituents and groups are as in formula I except where defined differently. The terms “room temperature” and “ambient temperature” shall mean, unless otherwise specified, a temperature between 16 and 25° C. The term “reflux” shall mean, unless otherwise stated, in reference to an employed solvent using a temperature at or slightly above the boiling point of the named solvent. It is understood that microwaves can be used for the heating of reaction mixtures. The terms “flash chromatography” or “flash column chromatography” shall mean preparative chromatography on silica using an organic solvent, or mixtures thereof, as mobile phase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbbreviations\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \natm\n \natmosphere;\n \n \n \naq.\n \naqueous;\n \n \n \n \n \nBINAP\n \n \n \n2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphtyl\n \n \n \nDBA\n \ndibenzylideneacetone;\n \n \n \nDCM\n \ndichloromethane;\n \n \n \n \nDME\n \n \n1,2-dimethoxyethane;\n \n \n \nDMF\n \ndimethylformamide;\n \n \n \nDMSO\n \ndimethyl sulfoxide;\n \n \n \ndppf\n \n1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene;\n \n \n \nEA\n \nethyl acetate;\n \n \n \nEtOAc \n \nethyl acetate;\n \n \n \nEtOH\n \nethanol;\n \n \n \nh\n \nhour;\n \n \n \nhep\n \nheptane;\n \n \n \nhex\n \nhexane(s);\n \n \n \nLAH\n \nlithium aluminumhydride;\n \n \n \nMeCN\n \nacetonitrile;\n \n \n \nMeOH\n \nmethanol;\n \n \n \nmin\n \nminutes;\n \n \n \nNaHMDS\n \nsodium hexamethyl disilazide;\n \n \n \no.n. or on \n \nover night;\n \n \n \nPd(dppf)Cl\n2 \n* DCM \n \n(1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene)palladium\n \n \n \nor Pd(dppf)Cl\n2 \n* CH\n2\nCl\n2\n:\n \n(II) chloride dichloromethane adduct;\n \n \n \nprep.

Compounds of formula II-VI are either commercially available, or can be prepared from either commercially available, or in the literature described compounds.

Compounds of formula VII are useful precursors for preparation of [\n11\nC]methyl labeled compounds of formula I.\n\n\nPreparation of Intermediates Useful for the Preparation of Precursors VII\n\n\nCompounds of formula VIII, IX, X, XI, XII and XIII are useful intermediates in the preparation of precursors of formula VII. R4, R5 and X\n1 \nto X\n4 \nare defined as in formula VII. Compounds of formula VIII-XIII are either commercially available, or can be prepared from commercially available samples, or non-limiting methods for their preparation are described herein, or in the literature. For example, compounds in which one or more of Y\n3\n, Y\n4\n, Y\n5\n, Y\n6\n, R4 or R5 does not correspond to the definitions of formula VIII-XIII, can be used for the preparation of compounds of formula VIII-XIII by transformations or introduction of substituents or groups. Such examples are given below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1) Preparation of compounds of formula VIII:\n\n\na) Palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling of aryl halides, or pseudo-halides, of intermediates of formula II (R1 or R2=OH) and X (e.g. Y\n5\n, Y\n6\n=chloride, bromide, iodide or triflates) with boronic acids or esters of formula X or II (R1 or R2=OH, Y\n5\n, Y\n6\n═B(OH)\n2 \nor B(Oalkyl)\n2\n), respectively, according to the procedure described for the preparation of compounds I. When R1 or R2 of formula II is a protected hydroxy-group, and the protective group employed is not stable under standard aqueous basic Suzuki conditions, as in the case of for example t-butyldimethylsilyl protected hydroxy-groups, it will normally be cleaved of during the reaction to generate a product in which the former protected hydroxy-group is found as the free hydroxy.\n\n\nb) Palladium-catalyzed Stille coupling of aryl halides, or pseudo-halides, of intermediates of formula II (R1 or R2=OH) and X (e.g. Y\n5\n, Y\n6\n=chloride, bromide, iodide or triflates) with aryl stannanes of formula X or II (R1 or R2=OH, Y\n5\n, Y\n6\n=e.g. Sn(n-Bu)\n3\n), respectively, according to the procedure described in the preparation of compounds I.\n\n\nc) By employment of compounds X\n1 \nand XII as starting materials in analogy to the methods described for the preparation of compounds I starting from IV and V.\n\n\nd) Starting from intermediates XIII in analogy to the synthesis of I from VI.\n\n\n2) Preparation of IX and X, in which Y\n5 \nand Y\n6 \nis an halide, a triflate, B(Oalkyl)\n2\n, B(OH)\n2\n, Sn(n-Bu)\n3 \nor MgX, may be done by the same procedures as described for the preparation of the corresponding compounds II, in which R1 or R2 is O—R4, where R4 is a suitable protective group compatible with the respective reaction conditions employed as well known to the one skilled in the art.\n\n\n3) Compounds XI and XIII may be prepared according to the synthesis of intermediates IV and VI.\n\n\nMethods of Preparation of Precursors of Formula VII\n\n\nIn the synthesis of precursors VII, the protective group R4 may be introduced either on a benzothiazole derivative before coupling of the hence produced intermediates IX with intermediates X, or after the fusion of benzothiazole derivatives with heterocycles X, i.e. on structures VIII. All protective groups that represent R4 may be introduced by conventional procedures. Non-limiting examples of methods for the preparation of precursors of formula VII are given below:\n\n\n1) Reacting intermediates VIII with a silylating agent, such as t-butyldimethylsilylchloride, in the presence of a base, such as imidazole or triethylamine, in a solvent, such as DMF or DCM, at a temperature from 0° C. to rt.\n\n\n2) Intermediates VIII may be treated with 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethylchloride and a base, for example (i-Pr)\n2\nNEt, NaH or Et\n3\nN in the presence of DMAP, in a solvent, such as DCM, DMF or benzene, at rt or elevated temperature.\n\n\n3) By treatment of VIII with p-methoxybenzylbromide and a base such as (i-Pr)\n2\nNEt in DCM at ambient temperature.\n\n\n4) Transition metal-catalyzed cross couplings of intermediates IX and X:\n\n\nPrecursors VII may be prepared from intermediates IX and X by the metal-catalyzed cross coupling reactions described for the preparation of compounds I by coupling II (R1 or R2=OH) and III provided that the R4-moiety is stable under the conditions employed.\n\n\n5) Preparation of precursors of formula VII may be done through intermolecular reactions between intermediates XI and XII, or alternatively, through intramolecular reactions of XIII, in accordance to methods 1c and 1d, respectively, as described for the syntheses of VIII.\n\n\nMethods of Preparation of Labeled Compounds of Formula I\n\n\nIn general, the same synthetic reactions used for the assembly of non-labeled compounds of formula I from non-labeled reagents or intermediates, can be employed for the analogous incorporation of a detectable isotope by use of the corresponding labeled reagents or intermediates.\n\n\nIt is preferred to introduce the label at a late stage of the synthesis toward compounds of formula I, especially if the label is an isotope with relatively short half-life, such as \n11\nC. Most preferred is to do this introduction as the last synthetic step.\n\n\nSeveral useful reagents, synthons or intermediates labeled with long-lived or non-radioactive isotopes, including for example [\n2/3\nH]H\n2\n, [\n2/3\nH]CH\n3\nI, [\n13/14\nC]CH\n3\nI, [\n13/14\nC]CN\n−\n, [\n13/14\nC]CO\n2 \nare commercially available and can, if needed, be further synthetically transformed by conventional synthetic methods. Reagents labeled with more short-lived isotopes, such as \n11\nC and \n18\nF, are generated by a cyclotron, followed by suitable trapping and optionally further synthetic manipulations to provide the desired reagent. The generation and the synthetic manipulations of labeled reagents and intermediates, and the use and chemistries of these precursors for the synthesis of more complex labeled is molecules, is well known to the one skilled in the art of radio-synthesis and labeling and reviewed in the literature (Långström et al. Acta Chem. Scand. 1999, 53, 651). For additional references see for example: Ali et al. Synthesis 1996, 423 for labeling with halogens; Antoni G., Kihlberg T., and Långström B. (2003) Handbook of nuclear chemistry, edited by Vertes A., Nagy S., and Klenscar Z., Vol. 4, 119-165 for labeling for PET-applications; Saljoughian et al. Synthesis 2002, 1781 for labeling with \n3\nH; McCarthy et al. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000, 6, 1057 for labeling with \n14\nC.\n\n\nDetectable isotopes, useful for the labeling of compounds of formula I as defined herein include, for use in PET: \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n75\nBr, \n76\nBr and \n120\nI, for use in SPECT: 123I and \n131\nI, for MRI-applications: \n19\nF and \n13\nC, for detection in in-vitro and post-mortem samples: \n3\nH, \n14\nC and \n125\nI. The most useful isotopes for labeling are \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n123\nI, \n19\nF, \n3\nH and \n14\nC.\n\n\nBelow follow non-limiting descriptions on processes for the preparation of labeled compounds of formula I:\n\n\nCompounds of formula I, in which either R1, R2, or R3 is hydroxy, amino or aminoalkyl are useful precursors for O- and N-alkylation, respectively, with a labeled alkylating agent, such as [\n11\nC]methyl iodide or triflate, as described in for example Solbach et al. Applied Radiation and Isotopes 2005, 62, 591 and Mathis et al. J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46, 2740, [\n3\nH]-methyl iodide, or [\n14\nC]-methyl iodide.\n\n\nFor example, the compounds of formula I in which R1 or R2 is hydroxy (the other is hydrogen), X1 or X2 is nitrogen (the other is carbon), X3 and X4 is carbon, and R3 is amino or aminomethyl, constitute suitable precursors for labeling. Treatment of an excess of either of these precursors with \n11\nC-methyl triflate, in a solvent such as acetone without added base, results in selective N-alkylation and thus in the formation of the corresponding \n11\nC labelled compounds of formula I in which R3 is transformed into NH[\n11\nC]CH\n3 \n(from amino) and NCH\n3\n[\n11\nC]CH\n3 \n(from aminomethyl), respectively. When the same before mentioned precursors, however, is treated with [\n11\nC]methyl iodide under basic condition, such as in the presence of potassium carbonate, in a solvent such as DMSO, selective O-alkylation occurs because of relatively higher reactivity of the oxygen-atom after deprotonation, and thus in the formation of compounds of formula I in which the OH-group (R1 or R2) is transformed into the O[\n11\nC]CH\n3\n-group.\n\n\nThe most suitable and preferred precursors for labeling by selective introduction of a \n11\nC-methyl group by N-alkylation, are compounds in which the reactivity to alkylation, of a present competing nucleophilic functional group, such as hydroxy, is lowered or blocked by a suitable protective group. The function of the protective group is in this context to protect the nucleophilic functional group against alkylation and should preferrably be stable under non-aqueous basic conditions, under which the desired N-alkylation is facilitated, but readily removed by other means after fulfillment of its duty. Such protective groups, and methods for their introduction and removal, are well known to the one skilled in the art. Examples of protective groups useful for protection of aromatic hydroxy-groups against competing alkylation include, but is not limited to, methyl, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl, alkoxymethyl and t-butyldimethylsilyl. Removal of such a protective group after the alkylation is well known to the one skilled in the art and include, in the case of silyl-based protective groups such as t-butyldimethylsilyl, for example treatment with a fluoride ion source, such as TBAF, or treatment with water under basic conditions in a suitable solvent, such as DMSO in the presence of KOH at rt.\n\n\nCompounds of formula I, in which either R1, R2, or R3 is amino, are useful precursor for labeling by initial diazotation, when appropriate followed by conversion into the corresponding triazine derivative, before subsequent treatment with labeled nucleophilic reagents according to standard reactions. Detectable isotopes that may be introduced this way include, but is not limited to \n18\nF, \n75\nBr, \n123\nI, \n125\nI and \n131\nI as described in for example Zhu et al. J. Org. Chem. 2002, 67, 943; Maeda et al. J. Label Compd Radiopharm 1985, 22, 487; Berridge et al. J. Label Compd Radiopharm 1985, 22, 687; Suchiro et al. J. Label Compd Radiopharm 1987, 24, 1143; Strouphauer et al. Int. J. Appl. Radiat. Isot. 1984, 35, 787; Kortylevicz et al. J. Label Compd Radiopharm 1994, 34, 1129; Khalaj et al. J. Label Compd Radiopharm 2001, 44, 235 and Rzeczotarski et al. J. Med. Chem. 1984, 27, 156. In compounds of formula I, where R1, R2, or R3 is a trialkyltin-group, halogenation with labeled reagents results in displacement of the trialkyltin-group as described in for example Staelens et al. J. Label Compd Radiopharm 2005, 48, 101; Hocke et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2004, 14, 3963; Zhuang et al. J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46, 237; Füchtner et al. Appl. Rad. Isot. 2003, 58, 575 and Kao et al. J. Label Compd Radiopharm 2001, 44, 889. The same precursors are also useful for palladium-catalyzed conversion into the corresponding \n11\nC-labeled ketones and methyl-derivatives as described in for example Lidström et al. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 1997, 2701 and Tarkiainen et al. J. Label Compd Radiopharm 2001, 44, 1013. The trialkyltin substituted compounds, in turn, are preferably prepared from the corresponding halides or pseudo-halides, such as the triflates, by well known methods employing palladium as catalyst in reaction with the corresponding distannane. When this methodology is used, the trialkyltin-group is preferably trimethyltin or tributyltin.\n\n\nWhen R1, R2, or R3, in a compound of formula I, is a leaving group suitable for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, a labeled nucleophile, such as a halogenide or cyanide, can be introduced by such a displacement, resulting in a labeled compound of formula I as described in for example Zhang et al. Appl. Rad. Isot. 2002, 57, 145. The aromatic ring on which the displacement takes place is preferably relatively electron-poor for a facile reaction, and might therefore need to be substituted with an electron-withdrawing activating group such as cyano, carbaldehyde or nitro. Useful reactions, closely related to nucleophilic aromatic substitutions and well known to the one skilled in the art, include the employment of stoichiometric amounts of copper-salts for the introduction of a labeled iodo-atom, and the use of palladium-catalysis for the introduction of a \n11\nC-labelled cyano-group, as described in for example Musacio et al. J. Label Compd Radiopharm 1997, 34, 39 and Andersson et al. J. Label Compd Radiopharm 1998, 41, 567 respectively.\n\n\nIf the aromatic ring onto which the leaving group is positioned is more electron-deficient as compared to benzene, such as Q of formula I as defined herein, it is generally not needed to employ activating groups for electrophilic aromatic substitution to take place. Compounds of formula I, where R3 is either of the leaving-groups fluoro, chloro, bromo, iodo, or a sulphonate ester, and either or both of X2 and X4 is nitrogen, are suitable precursors for labeling via nucleophilic aromatic substitution of R3. It is furthermore generally preferable to use a leaving group that is chemically diverse from the group introduced by the reaction with the labeled nucleophile, in order to facilitate chromatographic separation of the labeled reaction product from the unconsumed precursor.\n\n\nAdditional useful methods, well known to the one skilled in the art, for preparation of labeled compounds of formula I by functional group transformations of suitable precursors include N-acylation of amines with [\n11\nC], [\n14\nC], or [\n3\nH]acyl chlorides, palladium-catalyzed [\n11\nC] or [\n14\nC] cyanation of aromatic chlorides, bromides or iodides, transition-metal catalyzed substitution of suitable halides for \n3\nH in the presence of [\n3\nH]H\n2\n, and palladium-catalyzed carbonylations with [\n11/14\nC]CO (Perry et al. Organometallics 1994, 13, 3346).\n\n\nCOMPOUND EXAMPLES\n\n\nBelow follows a number of non-limiting examples of compounds of the invention. All of the below examplified compounds under the paragraph “compound examples”, or their corresponding non-labeled analogs, display an IC\n50 \nof less than 20 μM in the competition binding assay described herein.\n\n\nGeneral Methods\n\n\nAll solvents used were analytical grade and commercially available anhydrous solvents were routinely used for reactions.

The residual solvent signal was used as reference. The following reference signals were used: the middle line of DMSO-d\n6 \nδ 2.50; the middle line of CD\n3\nOD δ 3.31; CDCl\n3 \nδ 7.26. In those instances where spectra were run in a mixture of CDCl\n3 \nand CD\n3\nOD, the reference was set to 3.31 ppm. All chemical shifts are in ppm on the delta-scale (6) and the fine splitting of the signals as appearing in the recordings (s: singlet, br. s: broad singlet, d: doublet, t: triplet, q: quartet, m: multiplet).\n\n\n \n3\nH spectra were recorded on a \nBruker DRX\n 600 NMR Spectrometer, operating at 640 MHz for tritium and at 600 MHz for proton, equipped with a 5 mm \n3\nH/\n1\nH SEX probehead with Z-gradients. \n1\nH decoupled \n3\nH spectra were recorded on samples dissolved in CD\n3\nOD. For \n3\nH NMR spectra referencing, a ghost reference frequency was used, as calculated by multiplying the frequency of internal TMS in a \n1\nH spectrum with the Larmor frequency ratio between \n3\nH and \n1\nH (1.06663975), according to the description in Al-Rawi et al J.

The corresponding non-labeled analogs display an IC\n50 \nof less than 20 μM in the competition binding assay described herein.\n\n\n \n11\nC-Example 1\n\n\n[N-Methyl-\n11\nC]-2-(6-Methylamino-pyridin-3-yl)-benzothiazol-6-ol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlabeled 2-[6-(methylamino)pyridin-3-yl]-1,3-benzothiazol-6-ol, prepared as described herein, was used as analytical reference and standard. Other chemicals and reagents used were obtained from commercial sources and were of analytical grade. [\n11\nC]methane was obtained via the \n14\nN(p,α)\n11\nC reaction on nitrogen with 10% hydrogen, with 18 MeV protons using a GEMS PET trace cyclotron. The [\n11\nC]methane was passed through a heated column containing 12 to produce [\n11\nC]methyl iodide (Larsen et al. Appl. Radiat. Isot. 1997, 48, 153 and Sandell et al J. Labelled Compd Radiopharm. 2000, 43, 331). The generated [\n11\nC]MeI was trapped at rt in a vessel containing 5-(6-{[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxy}-1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)pyridin-2-amine (2.5 mg), DMSO (300 μl) and KOH (10 mg). The reaction mixture was then heated at 125° C. for 5 min., followed by removal of the TBDMS-group by treatment with water (200 μl) at rt for 2 min. The crude material thus obtained was purified by reversed phase HPLC, using a Waters μ-Bondapak C-18 column (300×7.8 mm, 10 mm) equipped with a UV-detector (λ=254 nm) and GM tube for radiation detection, employing CH\n3\nCN—aq. HCO\n2\nNH\n4 \n(0.1M) 30:70 v/v as the mobile phase at a flowrate of 6 ml/min. Analysis of the obtained title compound revealed an incorporation yield of [\n11\nC]MeI of about 50%, a radiochemical purity of >99%, and a specific radioactivity of 3861 Ci/mmol.\n\n\nBIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES\n\n\n[N-Methyl-3H\n3\n]-2-(6-Methylamino-pyridin-3-yl)-benzothiazol-6-ol (Example 32) and [N-methyl-\n11\nC]-2-(6-methylamino-pyridin-3-yl)-benzothiazol-6-ol (\n11\nC-Example 1), both compounds of the present invention, are referred to below either by these names or by “[\n3\nH]AZAD” and “[\n11\nC]AZAD”, respectively. The following compounds were used as comparative compounds and are referred to in the text below by their indicated corresponding names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention were tested in one or several of the following assays/experiments/studies:\n\n\nCompetition Binding Assay\n\n\nCompetition binding was performed in 384-well FB filter plates using synthetic Aβ 1-40 in 2.7 nM of [\n3\nH]PIB (or another \n3\nH-labeled radioligand when so mentioned) in phosphate buffer at pH 7.5, by adding various concentrations of non-radioactive compounds originally dissolved in DMSO. The binding mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature, followed by vacuum filtration, and subsequentially by washing twice with 1% Triton-X100. Scintillation fluid was thereafter added to the collected Aβ 1-40 on the filter plate, and the activity of the bound remaining radioligand ([\n3\nH]PIB or another \n3\nH-labeled radioligand) was measured using 1450 Microbeta from PerkinElmer.\n\n\nDissociation Experiments\n\n\nDissociation experiments were performed in 96-well polypropylene deep well plates. 2 μM human synthetic Aβ 1-40 fibrils in phosphate buffer pH 7.5, or buffer alone as control, was incubated with 9 nM of a \n3\nH-labeled radioligand of the present invention for 4 h at room temperature. Dissociation was started at different time points, by the addition of an equal volume of a non-labeled compound of the present invention, or a reference compound (10 μM), in 4% DMSO in phosphate buffer at pH 7.5. The radioactivity still bound to the Aβ 1-40 fibrils at the end of the incubation was detected on FB filters after filtration in a Brandel apparatus using a wash buffer containing 0.1% Triton-X100.\n\n\nIn Vivo Rat Brain Entry Studies\n\n\nBrain exposure after i.v administration was determined in rat brains using cassette dosing. Four different compounds were dosed followed by plasma and brain sampling at 2 and 30 minutes after the dosing. 2 to 30 min brain concentration ratios, and percentage of total of injected dose after 2 mins found in brain, were calculated. The compound concentrations were determined by analysis of protein precipitated plasma samples by reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to a electrospray tandem mass spectrometer.\n\n\nBinding to Amyloid Plagues in Post-Mortem Human AD Brains and Transgenic Mice Brains\n\n\nSlide-mounted brain sections (10 μm) from APP/PS1 transgenic mice were collected at the level of the lateral septum (bregma+0.98 mm; see Paxinos and Franklin, 2001). Human cortical sections (7 μm) from two AD patients and 1 control subject were obtained from a Dutch tissue bank.\n\n\nSections were preincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature in 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4) in the presence or absence of 1 μM PIB. Sections were transferred to buffer containing tritium-labeled compound (1 nM) with or without PIB (1 μM) and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Incubation was terminated by 3 consecutive 10 minute rinses in buffer (1° C.) followed by a rapid rinse in distilled water (1° C.). Sections were air dried in front of a fan. Dried sections and plastic tritium standards (Amersham microscales-3H) were apposed to phosphoimage plates (Fuji) in a cassette and exposed overnight. The following morning, the image plates were processed with a Fuji phosphoimager (BAS 2500) using BAS Reader software. The resulting image was converted to TIF format using Aida software, optimized with Adobe Photoshop (v 8.0) and quantified using Image-J (NIH). Data were statistically analyzed using Excel.\n\n\nBinding in APP/PS1 Mouse Brain After Compound Administration In-Vivo\n\n\nNaïve, awake mice were restrained and intravenously infused via the tail vein with either a tritium labeled compound of the present invention, or a tritium labeled reference compound via the tail vein. In one type of experiment, the animals were rapidly anesthetized with isofluorane and decapitated twenty minutes after compound administration (1 mCi). In another type of experiment, mice were given 1 mCi of a compound and were anesthetized and decapitated at a timepoint of 20, 40 or 80 minutes after administration. Brains were removed and frozen with powdered dry ice. Brains were sectioned (10 μm) in the coronal plane at the level of the striatum with a cryostat, thaw-mounted onto superfrost microscope slides and air-dried.\n\n\nMethods designed to optimize the imaging of bound ligand after in vivo administration were thereafter employed. To selectively reduce unbound radioactivity levels, one-half of the sections were rinsed (3×10 minutes) in cold (1° C.) Tris buffer (50 mM, pH7.4) followed by a rapid rinse in cold (1° C.) deionized water. Sections were then air dried in front of a fan. Rinsed as well as unrinsed sections and tritium standards were exposed to phosphoimage plates (Fuji). Phosphoimage plates were processed with a Fujifilm BAS-2500 phosphoimager using BAS Reader software.\n\n\nPET Studies in Non-Human Primates\n\n\nThe monkey PET study aimed to assess and compare a [\n11\nC]-labelled compound of this invention to [\n11\nC]PIB regarding measures of brain availability, non-specific binding in the brain, whole body biodistribution, elimination and exploration of regional differences in uptake. Five brain PET measurements were performed in three monkeys under anesthesia. In each PET-measurement a sterile physiological phosphate buffer (pH=7.4) solution containing 52-55 MBq of either a [\n11\nC]-labelled compound of this invention, or [\n11\nC]PIB, was injected as a bolus into a sural vein over a period of 5 seconds with simultaneous start of PET-data acquisition. Radioactivity in brain was measured continuously for 93 minutes. Only [\n11\nC]PIB measurement was performed in the first monkey. In the other two monkeys a [\n11\nC]-labelled compound of the present invention was measured first and [\n11\nC]PIB was administered in a subsequent measurement. The time between radioligand injections was approx. 2 h. PET measurements were evaluated with respect to the time-activity curve for the whole brain expressed as percent injected radioactivity dose.\n\n\nWhole body PET-measurement was performed in one monkey. A sterile physiological phosphate buffer pH=7.4) solution containing 51 MBq of [\n11\nC]PIB in the first measurement, and 57 MBq of a [\n11\nC]-labelled compound of the present invention in the second measurement, was injected as a bolus into a sural vein over a period of 5 seconds with simultaneous start of PET-data acquisition that lasted for 87 min. The time between radioligand injections was 2 h. PET measurements were assessed visually by creating planar maximum intensity projection images of decay uncorrected data and also converting decay corrected images to ones containing parts-per-million (ppm) values of the total injected radioactivity.\n\n\nBiological Example 1\n\n\nCharacterization of Specific Binding of Novel Heteroaryl Substituted Benzothiazole Derivatives to Aβ Amyloid Fibrils In Vitro\n\n\nSpecific binding was determined according to the competition binding assay described herein. The determined IC\n50\n's in the completion binding assays (using [\n3\nH]PIB as radioligand) of 5 compounds of the present invention are shown in Table 1. Results (activity of remaining [\n3\nH]PIB versus increasing concentration of non-labeled compounds) from typical completion assay experiments are exemplified in \nFIG. 1\n. In a similar way, competition studies with \n3\nH-labeled heteroaryl substituted benzthiazole derivates of the present invention were also conducted. Such results, from a typical competition study, are examplified in \nFIG. 2\n. PIB and 2-[6-(methylamino)pyridin-3-yl]-1,3-benzothiazol-6-ol (a novel compound of the present invention) both displaced [N-methyl-3H\n3\n]-2-(6-methylamino-pyridin-3-yl)-benzothiazol-6-ol (a \n3\nH-labeled compound of the present invention). The binding of [N-methyl-3H\n3\n]-2-(6-methylamino-pyridin-3-yl)-benzothiazol-6-ol (example 32) to Aβ1-40 fibrils, was reversible as evident from the dissociation experiment exemplified in \nFIG. 3\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC\n50\n's obtained of 5 exemplified compounds of the present\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninvention when run in the competion binding assay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNAME\n\n\nEXAMPLE\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5-(6-Methoxy-1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)-N-\n\n\n25\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmethylpyridin-2-amine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-[6-(Methylamino)pyridin-3-yl]-1,3-\n\n\n27\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbenzothiazol-6-ol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-(6-Methoxypyridin-3-yl)-1,3-\n\n\n9\n\n\n170\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbenzothiazole-6-carboxamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-[6-(4-Methylpiperazin-1-yl)pyridin-3-yl]-\n\n\n6\n\n\n176\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1,3-benzothiazol-6-ol Acetate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN-{2-[6-(4-Methylpiperazin-1-yl)pyridin-3-yl]-\n\n\n15\n\n\n186\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1,3-benzothiazol-6-yl}acetamide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiological Example 2\n\n\nIn Vivo Rat Brain Entry Study\n\n\nWith reference to \nFIG. 4\n, it can be seen that 2-[6-(methylamino)pyridin-3-yl]-1,3-benzothiazol-6-ol (example 27), a compound of the present invention, enters the rat brain quickly with an uptake value of 1% of the injected dose at the 2 min time point, and clears rapidly from rat brain tissue with a 2 minute to 30 minute brain concentration ratio of >15. The results from the corresponding experiment, run under the same settings but with PIB instead of 2-[6-(methylamino)pyridin-3-yl]-1,3-benzothiazol-6-ol, is included for comparison (\nFIG. 4\n).\n\n\nBiological Example 3\n\n\nBinding to Amyloid Plaques in Post-Mortem Human AD Brains and Transgenic Mice\n\n\nPostmortem brain tissue sections from AD brain and aged APP/PS1 transgenic mice were stained with [N-methyl-\n3\nH\n3\n]-2-(6-methylamino-pyridin-3-yl)-benzothiazol-6-ol (example 32). The APP/PS1 mouse is a double transgenic model combining two human gene mutations known to cause AD. In APP/PS1 mouse brain sections and in human cortical sections, [N-methyl-3H\n3\n]-2-(6-methylamino-pyridin-3-yl)-benzothiazol-6-ol and [\n3\nH]PIB labeled dense core plaques. In both tissues, binding was attenuated by 1 μM PIB. In superficial gray matter regions of human cortical sections, dense core plaque labeling in gray matter was visible against a background of diffuse labeling. The diffuse labeling was confined to gray matter regions whereas dense core plaque labeling could be seen outside of the superficial gray regions.\n\n\n[N-Methyl-\n3\nH\n3\n]-2-(6-methylamino-pyridin-3-yl)-benzothiazol-6-ol and [\n3\nH]PIB labeling were quantified in gray and white matter regions of human cortical sections. Specific binding was determined by subtracting binding in tissues co-exposed to 1 μM PIB. Analysis of these data showed that specific [N-methyl-\n3\nH\n3\n]-2-(6-methylamino-pyridin-3-yl)-benzothiazol-6-ol binding levels in superficial gray layers of human cortex was approximately 40% greater than binding observed with [\n3\nH]PIB (p=0.0033, t=4.13; Student's t-test). This difference was attributed to the substantially reduced levels of nonspecific binding observed in [N-methyl-\n3\nH\n3\n]-2-(6-methylamino-pyridin-3-yl)-benzothiazol-6-ol labeled tissues compared to those exposed to [\n3\nH]PIB. Further analysis of labeling in superficial cortical layers of tissue treated with or without PIB revealed large differences between [N-methyl-\n3\nH\n3\n]-2-(6-methylamino-pyridin-3-yl)-benzothiazol-6-ol and [\n3\nH]PIB in the ratio of total binding compared to nonspecific binding ([N-methyl-\n3\nH\n3\n]-2-(6-methylamino-pyridin-3-yl)-benzothiazol-6-ol; 10.78:1 vs PIB; 2.48:1). A representative example of [N-methyl-\n3\nH\n3\n]-2-(6-methylamino-pyridin-3-yl)-benzothiazol-6-ol (right hand pictures) and [\n3\nH]PIB (left hand pictures) binding of amyloid plaques in human AD brain (upper pictures), and of APP/PS1 transgenic mice brain (lower pictures), is shown in \nFIG. 5\n.\n\n\nBiological Example 4\n\n\nBinding of [\n3\nH]AZAD in APP/PS1 Mouse Brain After Compound Administration In Vivo\n\n\nThe in vivo binding properties of [\n3\nH]AZAD, a compound of the present invention (example 32), was explored in this example with special relevance to PET imaging methods in a transgenic mouse model (APP/PS1) engineered to overproduce human amyloid-β.\n\n\nIn one experiment the in vivo properties of [\n3\nH]AZAD were directly compared with those of [\n3\nH]PIB: After administration, followed by \ndecapitation\n 20 minutes thereafter, both [\n3\nH]AZAD and [\n3\nH]PIB labeled cortical structures (\nFIG. 6\n), which based on their size and distribution resemble the appearance of amyloid plaques labeled immunohistochemically with amyloid-D antibodies (Klunk et al. J. Neurosci. 2005, 25, 10598). Background binding levels (quantified in \nFIG. 7\n), especially in white matter tracts such as the corpus callosum and anterior commissure, but also in regions composed primarily of gray matter such as the striatum were more heavily labeled with [\n3\nH]PIB than with [\n3\nH]AZAD in rinsed as well as in unrinsed tissue. In brain areas rich in gray matter such as the striatum, nonspecific binding was generally lower than in white matter regions for both compounds, and in unrinsed tissue, did not differ significantly between the compounds. However, while nonspecific binding was not significantly reduced in rinsed tissues from mice given [\n3\nH]PIB in brain areas rich in gray matter (striatum), the in vitro rinse procedure did reduce nonspecific [\n3\nH]AZAD binding by 78.5% (Ligand×Rinse interaction: p<0.0001; df=1.6; F=72.72). In white matter regions, exemplified by the corpus callosum, nonspecific [\n3\nH]PIB binding was higher than that of [\n3\nH]AZAD regardless of rinse condition. Furthermore, while the in vitro rinse was only marginally effective in corpus callosum from mice given [\n3\nH]PIB, it dramatically reduced [\n3\nH]AZAD levels in corpus callosum (ligand×rinse interaction: p<0.0001; df=1.6; F=107.8). The ratio of the cortical plaque labeling divided by the area of cortex measured for both [\n3\nH]PIB and [\n3\nH]AZAD on rinsed brain sections are shown in \nFIG. 8\n.\n\n\nA second experiment focused on the timecourse of the uptake and clearance of [\n3\nH]AZAD at timepoints relevant to [\n11\nC]-PET imaging. Autoradiograms illustrating [\n3\nH]AZAD binding in APP/PS1 transgenic \n \n \nmouse brain sections\n \n \n 20, 40 and 80 minutes after administration are shown in \nFIG. 9\n. One-way ANOVA of cortical plaque labeling in rinsed tissue at different exposure intervals (\nFIG. 10\n) showed that [\n3\nH]AZAD binding was highest at 20 minutes and declined such that levels were barely detectable after 80 minutes (p=0.0424; df=2.5; F=10.84). In addition to [\n3\nH]AZAD cortical plaque labeling, total radioactivity levels in plaque free regions were compared to provide a measure of nonspecific labeling (\nFIG. 11\n). Two-way ANOVA of total radioactivity levels at is different exposure intervals showed that levels decreased significantly as the duration of exposure increased (main effect of exposure duration, p=0.0063; df=2.6; F=13.26)\n\n\nBiological Example 5\n\n\nPET Studies in Monkey\n\n\nThe time course of total brain radioactivity reflects the availability of the ligand in the target organ. For reference radioligands, e.g. [\n11\nC]raclopride, the fraction of the total injected radioactivity present in the brain during the first 5-10 min is usually above 1-2%. [\n11\nC]AZAD rapidly entered brain and the exposure was about 1-3% of total injected radioactivity (\nFIG. 12\n). Brain uptake of [\n11\nC]AZAD peaked in the first minute after injection surpassing that of [\n11\nC]PIB at this early time point. Brain concentration of [\n11\nC]AZAD thereafter declined rapidly with lower concentrations as compared to [\n11\nC]PIB at all time points. Because of lack of specific binding sites, i.e. amyloid plaques, in the studied monkeys in this example, no comparison could be made between [\n11\nC]AZAD and [\n11\nC]PIB with regard to their in vivo binding characteristics to such plaques. The brain uptake in this experiment is, however, illustrative of and reflects unspecific binding (FIG. \n13\n). Taken together, these findings support that [\n11\nC]AZAD enters brain tissue in primates and has significantly lower unspecific binding as compared to [\n11\nC]PIB at time points of relevance for PET-detection of amyloid plaques. Whole body PET measurements were performed to investigate and compare the peripheral distribution and elimination routes of [\n11\nC]AZAD and [\n11\nC]PIB. As can be seen in \nFIGS. 14 and 15\n, the two ligands have similar elimination routes consisting of urinary excretion and hepatobiliary secretion. 1 hour post administration, most of the radioactivity was localized in the bladder and gastroenteral tract. Accumulation in other organs, e.g. lungs or bone marrow, was very low. [\n11\nC]AZAD had faster elimination and lower non-eliminatory (e.g. lung) disposition as compared to [\n11\nC]PIB. These results indicate a favourable radiation safety of [\n11\nC]AZAD.\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n.
