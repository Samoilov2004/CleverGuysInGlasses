Description\n\n\n\n\n BENZENE SULFONAMIDE THIAZOLE AND OXAZOLE COMPOUNDS\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to benzene sulfonamide thiazole and oxazole compounds, compositions containing the same, as well as processes for the preparation and methods of using such compounds and compositions.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nBoth receptor tyrosine kinases and serine/threonine kinases have been implicated in cellular signaling pathways that control cell function, division, growth, differentiation, and death (apoptosis) through reversible phosphorylation of the hydroxyl groups of tyrosine or serine and threonine residues, respectively, in proteins. In signal transduction, for example, extracellular signals are transduced via membrane receptor activation, with amplification and propagation using a complex choreography of cascades of protein phosphorylation, and protein dephosphorylation events to avoid uncontrolled signaling. These signaling pathways are highly regulated, often by complex and intermeshed kinase pathways where each kinase may itself be regulated by one or more other kinases and protein phosphatases. The biological importance of these finely tuned systems is such that a variety of cell proliferative disorders have been linked to defects in one or more of the various cell signaling pathways mediated by tyrosine or serine/threonine kinases.\n\n\nReceptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) catalyze phosphorylation of certain tyrosyl amino acid residues in various proteins, including themselves, which govern cell growth, proliferation and differentiation.\n\n\nDownstream of the several RTKs lie several signaling pathways, among them is the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK kinase pathway. It is currently understood that activation of Ras GTPase proteins in response to growth factors, hormones, cytokines, etc. stimulates phosphorylation and activation of Raf kinases. These kinases then phosphorylate and activate the intracellular protein kinases MEK1 and MEK2, which in turn phosphorylate and activate other protein kinases, ERK1 and 2. This signaling pathway, also known as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway or cytoplasmic cascade, mediates cellular responses to growth signals. The ultimate function of this is to link receptor \n\n activity at the cell membrane with modification of cytoplasmic or nuclear targets that govern cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in various Ras GTPases and the B-Raf kinase have been identified that can lead to sustained and constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, ultimately resulting in increased cell division and survival. As a consequence of this, these mutations have been strongly linked with the establishment, development, and progression of a wide range of human cancers. The biological role of the Raf kinases, and specifically that of B-Raf, in signal transduction is described in Davies, H., et al., Nature (2002) 9:1-6; Garnett, MJ. & Marais, R., Cancer Cell (2004) 6:313-319; Zebisch, A. & Troppmair, J., Cell.

The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) include conventional salts formed from pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic) inorganic or organic acids or bases as well as quaternary ammonium salts. Representative salts include the following: acetate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate, bromide, calcium edetate, camsylate, carbonate, chloride, clavulanate, citrate, dihydrochloride, edetate, edisylate, estolate, esylate, ethanol amine, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glutamate, glycollylarsanilate, hexylresorcinate, hydrabamine, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroxynaphthoate, iodide, isethionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate (methanesulfonate), methylbromide, methylnitrate, methylsulfate, monopotassium maleate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate, N-methylglucamine, oxalate, pamoate (embonate), palmitate, pantothenate, phosphate/diphosphate, polygalacturonate, potassium, salicylate, sodium, stearate, subacetate, succinate, tannate, tartrate, teoclate, tosylate (methylbenzenesulfonate), triethiodide, trimethylammonium and valerate. Other salts, such as oxalic and trifluoroacetic, which are not themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be useful in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining compounds of this invention and these form a \n\n further aspect of the invention. In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is in the form of the free base. In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is in the form of the mesylate salt. In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is in the form of the sulfate salt. In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is in the form of the hydrochloride salt. In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is in the form of the sodium salt. Certain salt versions of the compounds may be solvates, particularly hydrates. In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is in the form of a mono-, di-, tri- or hemi- hydrate.\n\n\nProcesses for preparing pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds such as the compounds of formula (I) are conventional in the art. See, e.g., Burger's Medicinal Chemistry And Drug Discovery 5th Edition, VoI 1 : Principles And Practice. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, in the processes described below for the preparation of compounds of formula (I), certain intermediates, may be in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound. Processes for preparing pharmaceutically acceptable salts of intermediates are known in the art and are analogous to the processes for preparing pharmaceutically acceptable salts of other compounds such as the compounds of formula (I).\n\n\nCompounds of the invention are believed to inhibit of one or more kinases and in particular one or more Raf family kinases (\"Raf inhibitor\"). Compounds of the invention may also inhibit one or more other kinases, and particularly tyrosine kinases. Certain compounds of the invention may inhibit B-Raf (\"B-Raf inhibitor\"). It is well documented that Raf inhibitors, including B-Raf inhibitors, are believed to be useful as anticancer and antitumor agents. See, e.g., Davies (2002) supra, Garnett (2004) supra, and Zebisch (2006) supra. The anticancer and antitumor effects of these kinase inhibitors is currently believed to result from inhibition of one or more Raf family kinases, and the effect of such inhibition on cell lines whose growth and/or viability is dependent on the kinase activity of Raf family kinases.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention may be Raf inhibitors and optionally also inhibit one or more ErbB family kinases (i.e., EGFR, ErbB2 and ErbB4). Certain compounds of the invention may inhibit B-Raf and also inhibit one or more ErbB family kinases (i.e., EGFR, ErbB2 and ErB4). \n\n Some compounds of the invention may be selective inhibitors of Raf family kinases (\"selective Raf inhibitor\"), meaning that preferential inhibition of one or more Raf family kinases is significantly greater than that of any number of other kinases, for example by a factor of 5-fold or more.\n\n\nHowever, the present invention is not limited to compounds which are selective inhibitors of one or more Raf family kinases rather, the present invention expressly contemplates that certain compounds of the invention may possess activity against multiple kinases, including kinases other than Raf family kinases. For example, particular compounds of the invention may possess activity against multiple other kinases, including but not limited to EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB4, IGF-1 R, IR, IRR, Src, VEGFR, PDGFR, Met, Lyn, Lck, Alk5, Aurora A and B, JNK, Syk, p38, BTK, FAK, AbI, CK1. cKit, Epherin receptors (for example EphB4), FGFR, Fit, Fyn, Hck, JAK, MLK, PKCμ, Ret, Yes, and BRK, as well. Particular compounds of the invention may be deemed to be unselective or nonselective, meaning that they are not considered by one skilled in the art to be selective for any particular kinase over others.\n\n\nAs used herein, a Raf inhibitor is a compound that exhibits a plC\n50\n of greater than about 6 against at least one Raf family kinase in the Raf inhibition enzyme assay described below and/or an IC\n50\n of not greater than about 5 μM potency against at least one cell line that expresses mutated B-Raf kinase (e.g., A375P, Colo205, HT-29, SK-MEL-3, SK- MEL-28) in the methylene blue and/or the CellTiter-Glo cellular proliferation assays described below. In a particular embodiment, a Raf inhibitor refers to a compound of the invention that exhibits a plC\n50\n of greater than about 6.5 against at least one Raf family kinase in the Raf inhibition enzyme assay described below and an IC\n50\n of not greater than about 50OnM potency against at least one cell line that expresses mutated B-Raf kinase in the methylene blue and/or the CellTiter-Glo cellular proliferation assays described below.\n\n\nA \"B-Raf inhibitor\" refers to a compound of the invention that exhibits a plCso of greater than about 6.5 against B-Raf (including B-Raf mutants) in the Raf inhibition enzyme assay described below and an IC50 of not greater than about 50OnM potency against at \n\n least one cell line that expresses mutated B-Raf kinase in the methylene blue and/or the CellTiter-Glo cellular proliferation assay described below.\n\n\nThe present invention provides compounds for use in medical therapy in a mammal, e.g., a human, in need thereof. The present invention provides methods for the treatment of several conditions in a mammal, in need thereof, all of which comprise the step of administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. All methods described herein are applicable to mammals, and particularly to humans.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"treatment\" or \"treating\" in the context of therapeutic methods, refers to alleviating the specified condition, eliminating or reducing the symptoms of the condition, slowing or eliminating the progression, invasion, or metastatic spread of the condition and preventing or delaying the reoccurrence of the condition in a previously afflicted subject. The present invention further provides use of the compounds of the invention for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of several conditions in a mammal (e.g., human) in need thereof.\n\n\nMore particularly, the present invention provides compounds for use in the treatment of a condition mediated by at least one Raf family kinases (e.g., B-Raf) in a mammal in need thereof. The present invention provides a method for treating a condition mediated by at least one Raf family kinase (e.g., B-Raf) in a mammal (e.g., a human) in need thereof, which method comprises administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of the invention.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the invention provides compounds for use in regulating, modulating, binding or inhibiting one or more Raf family kinases (e.g., B-Raf) in a mammal. The invention also provides methods of regulating, modulating, binding, or inhibiting at least one Raf family kinase (e.g., B-Raf) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. \"Regulating, modulating, binding or inhibiting at least one Raf family kinase\" refers to regulating, modulating, binding or inhibiting the activity of at least one Raf family kinase, as well as regulating, modulating, binding or inhibiting overexpression of an upstream regulator of at least one Raf family kinase in order to inhibit the cellular potency of its signaling ability. \n\n In a particular embodiment, the invention provides compounds for use in the treatment of a condition mediated by inappropriate activity of one or more Raf family kinases (e.g., B- Raf), or an upstream activator of one or more Raf family kinases in a mammal. The invention further provides methods for the treatment of a condition mediated by inappropriate activity of one or more Raf family kinases (particularly B-Raf), in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administering to the mammal, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. In an additional aspect, the present invention provides the use of a compound of the invention for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a condition mediated by inappropriate activity of one or more Raf family kinases (particularly B-Raf), in a mammal. One example of a condition mediated by inappropriate activity of one or more Raf family kinases includes neoplasms.\n\n\nBy \"inappropriate activity\" is meant Raf family kinase activity that deviates from the expected activity for that kinase or for an upstream activator of that kinase in a particular mammal. The inappropriate activity of a Raf family kinase may arise from one or more of A-Raf, B-Raf or c-Raf or an upstream activator of a Raf family kinase. Inappropriate Raf family kinase activity may take the form of, for instance, an abnormal increase in activity, or an aberration in the timing and/or control of Raf family kinase activity. Such inappropriate activity may result, for example, from overexpression or mutation of the kinase, upstream activator, receptor or ligand leading to inappropriate or uncontrolled activation of the corresponding kinase or receptor. Furthermore, it is also contemplated that unwanted Raf family kinase activity may reside in an abnormal source, such as a neoplasm. Thus, the level of Raf family kinase activity does not need to be abnormal to be considered inappropriate in the case where the activity derives from an abnormal source including, but not limited to, upstream activators (e.g., activated mutant Ras GTPases) or neoplasm. In one example of inappropriate Raf family kinase activity not resulting from mutation or overexpression of a Raf family kinase, inappropriate activity of a Ras GTPase may result from mutation or overexpression of Ras GTPase, for example the G13D mutation in KRas2, and may lead to overactivation of the MAPK pathway mediated by Raf family kinase activity.\n\n\nThus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides compounds for use in the treatment of a condition which directly or indirectly results from a mutation of a Raf family kinase or overexpression of a Raf family kinase, or a mutation of an upstream activator \n\n of a Raf family kinase or overexpression of an upstream activator of a Raf family kinase in a mammal in need thereof. The present invention provides methods for the treatment of a condition which directly or indirectly results from mutation of a Raf family kinase or overexpression of a Raf family kinase, or a mutation of an upstream activator of a Raf family kinase or overexpression of an upstream activator of a Raf family kinase in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administering to the mammal, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. In an additional aspect, the present invention provides the use of a compound of the invention for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a condition which directly or indirectly results from mutation of a Raf family kinase or overexpression of a Raf family kinase, or a mutation of an upstream activator of a Raf family kinase or overexpression of an upstream activator of a Raf family kinase in a mammal. Conditions which are mediated by at least one Raf family kinase, and particularly conditions mediated by inappropriate activity of one or more Raf family kinases, including those which directly or indirectly result from mutation of a Raf family kinase, overexpression of a Raf family kinase, or mutation of an upstream activator of a Raf family kinase or overexpression of an upstream activator of a Raf family kinase are known in the art and include but are not limited to neoplasms.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention may also be used in the treatment of conditions attenuated by inhibition of a Raf family kinase (particularly B-Raf). Further provided are methods for treating a condition attenuated by inhibition of a Raf family kinase (particularly B-Raf) in a mammal in need thereof, comprising administering to the mammal, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Also provided is the use of a compound of the invention for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a condition attenuated by inhibition of a Raf family kinase (particularly B-Raf) in a mammal. Conditions attenuated by inhibition of a Raf family kinase (including B-Raf) include but are not limited to neoplasms.\n\n\nAccordingly, compounds of the invention may be used in the treatment of a neoplasm, particularly a susceptible neoplasm (a cancer or tumor) in a mammal. The present invention also provides a method for treating a neoplasm, particularly a susceptible neoplasm in a mammal in need thereof, which method comprises administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of the invention. The invention also provides the use of a compound of the invention for the preparation of a \n\n medicament for the treatment of neoplasm, particularly a susceptible neoplasm, in a mammal.\n\n\n\"Susceptible neoplasm\" as used herein refers to neoplasms which are susceptible to treatment by a kinase inhibitor and particularly neoplasms that are susceptible to treatment by a Raf inhibitor. Neoplasms which have been associated with inappropriate activity of one or more Raf family kinases and particularly neoplasms which are exhibit mutation of a Raf family kinase, overexpression of a Raf family kinase, or mutation of an upstream activator of a Raf family kinase or overexpression of an upstream activator of a Raf family kinase, and are therefore susceptible to treatment with an Raf inhibitor are known in the art, and include both primary and metastatic tumors and cancers. See,\n\n\nCatalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), the Wellcome Trust Sanger\n\n\nInstitute, http:/^ and those references cited in the background.\n\n\nSpecific examples of susceptible neoplasms within the scope of the invention include, but are not limited to:\n\n\nBarret's adenocarcinoma; billiary tract carcinomas; breast cancer; cervical cancer; cholangiocarcinoma; central nervous system tumors including primary CNS tumors such as glioblastomas, astrocytomas (including glioblastoma multiforme) and ependymomas, and secondary CNS tumors (i.e., metastases to the central nervous system of tumors originating outside of the central nervous system), colorectal cancer, including large intestinal colon carcinoma; gastric cancer; carcinoma of the head and neck including squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck; hematologic cancers including leukemias and lymphomas such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelogenous leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, megakaryoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma and erythroleukemia; \n\n hepatocellular carcinoma; lung cancer including small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer; ovarian cancer; endometrial cancer; pancreatic cancer; pituitary adenoma; prostate cancer; renal cancer; sarcoma; skin cancers including melanomas; and thyroid cancers.\n\n\nThe foregoing list is intended to disclose each of the recited neoplasms individually.

In particular, metastases to the central nervous system (i.e., secondary CNS tumors), and particularly the brain (i.e., brain metastases), are well documented for tumors and cancers, such as breast, lung, melanoma, renal and colorectal. As used herein, reference to uses or methods for treatment or treatments for a \"neoplasm,\" \"tumor\" or \"cancer\" in a subject includes use for and treatment of the primary neoplasm, tumor or cancer, and where appropriate, also the use for and treatment of metastases (i.e., metastatic tumor growth) as well.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the susceptible neoplasm is colorectal cancer and the invention provides compounds for use in the treatment of colorectal cancer in a mammal (e.g., human) and the use of such compounds for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of colorectal cancer in a mammal (e.g., human).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the susceptible neoplasm is melanoma, and the invention provides compounds for use in the treatment of melanoma in a mammal (e.g., human) \n\n and the use of such compounds for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of melanoma in a mammal (e.g., human).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the susceptible neoplasm is cholangiocarcinoma, and the invention provides compounds for use in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma in a mammal (e.g., human) and the use of such compounds for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma in a mammal (e.g., human).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the susceptible neoplasm is thyroid cancer, and the invention provides compounds for use in the treatment of thyroid cancer in a mammal (e.g., human) and the use of such compounds for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of thyroid cancer in a mammal (e.g., human).\n\n\nIn one particular embodiment, the susceptible neoplasm is breast cancer and the invention provides compounds for use in the treatment of breast cancer in a mammal (e.g., human) and the use of such compounds for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of breast cancer in a mammal (e.g., human).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the susceptible neoplasm is ovarian cancer and the invention provides compounds for use in the treatment of ovarian cancer in a mammal (e.g., human) and the use of such compounds for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of ovarian cancer in a mammal (e.g., human).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the susceptible neoplasm is non-small cell lung cancer, and the invention provides compounds for use in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in a mammal (e.g., human) and the use of such compounds for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in a mammal (e.g., human).\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention can be used alone in the treatment of each of the foregoing conditions or can be used to provide additive or potentially synergistic effects with certain existing chemotherapies, radiation, biological or immunotherapeutics\n\n\n(including monoclonal antibodies) and vaccines. The compounds of the invention may be useful for restoring effectiveness of certain existing chemotherapies and radiation and or increasing sensitivity to certain existing chemotherapies and/or radiation. \n\n In addition to the treatment of susceptible neoplasms, the compounds of the invention may also be used in the treatment of other conditions attenuated by inhibition of a Raf family kinase, such as cardio-facio cutaneous syndrome and polycystic kidney disease.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating a susceptible neoplasm in a mammal in need thereof comprising the steps of:\n\n\n(a) analyzing a sample from said neoplasm to determine whether an activating mutation is present in the coding sequence for B-Raf in cells of said neoplasm;\n\n\n(b) selecting a mammal having a neoplasm with an activating mutation in the coding sequence for B-Raf; and\n\n\n(c) administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention to the mammal selected in step (b).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the activating mutation present in the coding sequence for BRAF results in a BRAF having an amino acid substitution selected from the group consisting of R462I, I463S, G464V, G464E, G466A, G466E, G466V, G469A, G469E,\n\n\nD594V, F595L, G596R, L597V, L597R, T599I, V600E, V600D, V600K, V600R, T1 19S, and K601 E. See, for example, Figure 2 of Halilovic and Solvit (2008) Current Opinion in\n\n\nPharmacology 8:419-26.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for treating a susceptible neoplasm in a mammal in need thereof comprising the steps of:\n\n\n(a) analyzing a sample from said neoplasm to determine whether a mutation encoding a V600E amino acid substitution is present in the coding sequence for B-Raf in cells of said neoplasm;\n\n\n(b) selecting a mammal having a neoplasm with a mutation encoding the V600E amino acid substitution in B-Raf; and\n\n\n(c) administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention to the mammal selected in step (b).\n\n\nThe V600E amino acid substitution in B-Raf is described, for example, in Kumar et al. (2004) J Invest Dermatol. 122(2):342-8. This mutation commonly results from a T1799A mutation in the coding sequence for human B-Raf. Accordingly, in one embodiment of the present invention, the step of analyzing a sample from said neoplasm to determine \n\n whether a mutation encoding a V600E amino acid substitution is present in the coding sequence for B-Raf is performed by determining whether the coding sequence for B-Raf in cells of the neoplasm contains the T1799A mutation.\n\n\nThe neoplasm may be selected from Barret's adenocarcinoma; billiary tract carcinomas; breast cancer; cervical cancer; cholangiocarcinoma; central nervous system tumors including primary CNS tumors such as glioblastomas, astrocytomas (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme) and ependymomas, and secondary CNS tumors (i.e., metastases to the central nervous system of tumors originating outside of the central nervous system); colorectal cancer including large intestinal colon carcinoma; gastric cancer; carcinoma of the head and neck including squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck; hematologic cancers including leukemias and lymphomas such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelogenous leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, megakaryoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma and erythroleukemia; hepatocellular carcinoma; lung cancer including small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer; ovarian cancer; endometrial cancer; pancreatic cancer; pituitary adenoma; prostate cancer; renal cancer; sarcoma; skin cancers including melanomas; and thyroid cancers.\n\n\nIn particular embodiments, the neoplasm is selected from breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and thyroid cancer. In one preferred embodiment, the neoplasm is melanoma.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the mammal is a human.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the compound of the invention is ,N-{3-[5-(2-amino-4-pyrimidinyl)-2- (1 ,1-dimethylethyl)-1 ,3-thiazol-4-yl]-2-fluorophenyl}-2,6-difluorobenzenesulfonamide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In a particular embodiment, the compound of the invention is N-{3-[5-(2-amino-4-pyrimidinyl)-2-(1 ,1-dimethylethyl)-1 ,3-thiazol-4-yl]-2- fluorophenyl}-2,6-difluorobenzenesulfonamide mesylate. In an alternate embodiment, the compound of the invention is N-{3-[5-(2-amino-4-pyrimidinyl)-2-(1 ,1-dimethylethyl)- 1 ,3-thiazol-4-yl]-2-fluorophenyl}-2,6-difluorobenzenesulfonamide \n\n The sample of the neoplasm to be analyzed for the presence of B-raf activating mutations can be derived from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, single cells, a collection of cells, tissue, cell culture, bone marrow, blood, or other bodily fluids. The tissue or cell source may include a tissue biopsy sample, a cell sorted population, cell culture, or a single cell. In selecting a sample, the percentage of the sample that constitutes neoplastic cells should be considered. In some embodiments, the sample from the neoplasm is fixed using a preservative prior to analyzing for the presence of an activating mutation.\n\n\nThe step of analyzing a sample from the neoplasm to determine whether an activating mutation is present in the coding sequence for B-Raf in cells of said neoplasm may be performed using any method known in the art. For example, the coding sequence for B- raf in cells of the sample may be analyzed to determine if it contains a mutation which results in the expression of activated B-Raf. Methods for detecting such mutations are well known in the art. See, for example, Whitcombe et al. (1999) Nature Biotechnology 17:804-7, Gibson (2006) Clinica Chimica Acta 363: 32-47, Kim and Misra (2007) Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering 9:289-320, and U.S. Patent Nos. 6,326,145 and 6,270,967). Alternatively, activating mutations in B-Raf may be identified by directly detecting the activated B-raf protein using an agent (e.g. an antibody) that selectively binds activated B-raf.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"therapeutically effective amount\" means an amount of a compound of the invention which is sufficient, in the subject to which it is administered, to elicit a biological or medical response of a cell culture, tissue, system, mammal (including human) that is being sought, for instance, by a researcher or clinician. The term also includes within its scope amounts effective to enhance normal physiological function. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention for the treatment of a condition mediated by at least one Raf family kinase is an amount sufficient to treat the condition in the particular subject. Similarly, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention for the treatment of a susceptible neoplasm is an amount sufficient to treat the particular susceptible neoplasm in the subject. In one embodiment of the present invention, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention is an amount sufficient to regulate, modulate, bind or inhibit at least one Raf family kinase. More particularly, in such embodiment, the \n\n therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention is an amount sufficient to regulate, modulate, bind or inhibit B-Raf.\n\n\nThe precise therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of the invention will depend on a number of factors. There are variables inherent to the compounds including, but not limited to, the following: molecular weight, inhibitory activity at the target kinase, absorption, bioavailability, distribution in the body, tissue penetration, half- life, metabolism, protein binding, and excretion. These variables determine what dose of compound needs to be administered in order to inhibit the target kinase by a sufficient percentage and for a sufficient amount of time to have the desired effect on the condition being treated (e.g., neoplasm). In general, the goal will be to inhibit the target kinase by 50% or more for as long as possible. The duration of drug exposure will be limited only by the compound half-life, and side effects from treatment requiring cessation of dosing. The amount of compound administered will also depend on factors related to patients and disease including, but not limited to, the following: the age, weight, concomitant medications and medical condition of the subject being treated, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, the nature of the formulation, and the route of administration. Ultimately the dose will be at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. Typically, the compound of the invention will be given for treatment in the range of 0.01 to 30 mg/kg body weight of recipient (mammal) per day or per dose or per cycle of treatment and more usually in the range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg body weight per day or per dose or per cycle of treatment. Thus, for a 70kg adult human being treated for a condition mediated by or correlated to at least one Raf family kinase, the actual amount per day or per dose or per cycle of treatment would usually be from 1 to 2000 mg and this amount may be given in a single or multiple doses per day or per dose or per cycle of treatment. Dosing regimens may vary significantly and will be determined and altered based on clinical experience with the compound. The full spectrum of dosing regimens may be employed ranging from continuous dosing (with daily doses) to intermittent dosing. A therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula (I) may be determined as a proportion of the therapeutically effective amount of the compound of formula (I) as the free base. It is envisaged that similar dosages would be appropriate for treatment of the susceptible neoplasms described above. \n\n While it is possible that, for use in therapy, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention may be administered as the raw chemical, it is typically presented as the active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition or formulation. Accordingly, the invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention. The pharmaceutical composition may further comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, and/or excipients. The carrier(s), diluent(s) and/or excipient(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is also provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation including admixing a compound of the invention with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents and/or excipients.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations may be presented in unit dose forms containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient per unit dose. Such a unit may contain, for example, 0.5 mg to 1 g, preferably 1 mg to 700 mg, more preferably 5 mg to 100 mg of a compound of the invention (as a free-base, solvate (including hydrate) or salt, in any form), depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration, and the age, weight and condition of the patient. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose, weekly dose, monthly dose, a sub-dose or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient. Furthermore, such pharmaceutical formulations may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the pharmacy art.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations may be adapted for administration by any appropriate route, for example by the oral (including capsules, tablets, liquid-filled capsules, disintegrating tablets, immediate, delayed and controlled release tablets, oral strips, solutions, syrups, buccal and sublingual), rectal, nasal, inhalation, topical (including transdermal), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intradermal) route. Such formulations may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for example by bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier(s), excipient(s) or diluent. Generally, the carrier, excipient or diluent employed in the pharmaceutical formulation is \"non-toxic,\" meaning that it/they is/are deemed safe for consumption in the amount delivered in the pharmaceutical composition, and \"inert\" \n\n meaning that it/they does/do not appreciably react with or result in an undesired effect on the therapeutic activity of the active ingredient.\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as liquid-filled or solid capsules; immediate, delayed or controlled release tablets; powders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or nonaqueous liquids; edible foams or whips; oil-in-water liquid emulsions, water-in-oil liquid emulsions or oral strips, such as impregnated gel strips.\n\n\nFor instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Powders are prepared by comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing with a similarly comminuted pharmaceutical carrier such as an edible carbohydrate, as, for example, starch or mannitol. Flavoring, preservative, dispersing and coloring agent can also be present.\n\n\nSolid capsules are made by preparing a powder mixture, as described above, and filling formed gelatin sheaths. Glidants and lubricants such as colloidal silica, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate or solid polyethylene glycol can be added to the powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrating or solubilizing agent such as agar- agar, calcium carbonate or sodium carbonate can also be added to improve the availability of the medicament when the capsule is ingested.\n\n\nMoreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like. Tablets are formulated, for example, by preparing a powder mixture, granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and disintegrant and pressing into tablets. A powder mixture is prepared by mixing the compound, suitably comminuted, with a diluent or \n\n base as described above, and optionally, with a binder such as carboxymethylcellulose, an alginate, gelatin, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a solution retardant such as paraffin, a resorption accelerator such as a quaternary salt and/or an absorption agent such as bentonite, kaolin or dicalcium phosphate. The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials and forcing through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powder mixture can be run through the tablet machine and the result is imperfectly formed slugs broken into granules. The granules can be lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. The compounds of the present invention can also be combined with a free flowing inert carrier and compressed into tablets directly without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A clear or opaque protective coating consisting of a sealing coat of shellac, a coating of sugar or polymeric material and a polish coating of wax can be provided. Dyestuffs can be added to these coatings to distinguish different unit dosages.\n\n\nOral fluids such as solutions, syrups and elixirs can be prepared in dosage unit form so that a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of the compound. Solutions and syrups can be prepared by dissolving the compound in a suitably flavored aqueous solution, while elixirs are prepared through the use of a pharmaceutically acceptable alcoholic vehicle.

Appropriate doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art. The appropriate dose of the compound(s) of the invention and the other therapeutically active agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect, and are within the expertise and discretion of the attendant clinician.\n\n\nTypically, any chemotherapeutic agent that has activity against a susceptible neoplasm being treated may be utilized in combination with the compounds of the invention, provided that the particular agent is clinically compatible with therapy employing a compound of the invention. Typical anti-neoplastic agents useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to: alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, antitumor antibiotics, antimitotic agents, topoisomerase I and Il inhibitors, hormones and hormonal analogues; retinoids, signal transduction pathway inhibitors including inhibitors of cell growth or growth factor function, angiogenesis inhibitors, and serine/threonine or other \n\n kinase inhibitors; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors; antisense therapies and immunotherapeutic agents, including monoclonals, vaccines or other biological agents.\n\n\nAlkylating agents are non-phase specific anti-neoplastic agents and strong electrophiles.

The end result of discontinuing S phase is cell death. Antimetabolite neoplastic agents may be employed in combination with the compounds of the invention in the compositions and methods described above. Examples of antimetabolite anti-neoplastic agents include but are not limited to purine and pyrimidine analogues and anti-folate compounds, and more specifically, hydroxyurea, cytosine, arabinoside, ralitrexed, tegafur, fluorouracil (e.g., 5FU), methotrexate, cytarabine, mecaptopurine and thioguanine.\n\n\nAntitumor antibiotic agents are non-phase specific agents, which bind to or intercalate with DNA. Typically, such action disrupts ordinary function of the nucleic acids, leading to cell death. Antitumor antibiotics may be employed in combination with the compounds of the invention in the compositions and methods described above. Examples of antitumor antibiotic agents include, but are not limited to, actinomycins such as dactinomycin; anthracyclines such as daunorubicin, doxorubicin, idarubicin, epirubicin and mitoxantrone; , mitomycin C and bleomycins.\n\n\nAntimicrotubule or antimitotic agents are phase specific agents active against the microtubules of tumor cells during M or the mitosis phase of the cell cycle.

Examples of camptothecins include, but are not limited to amsacrine, irinotecan, topotecan, and the various optical forms of 7-(4-methylpiperazino-methylene)-10,11-ethylenedioxy-20- camptothecin. Topoisomerase inhibitors may be employed in combination with the compounds of the invention in the compositions and methods described above.\n\n\nHormones and hormonal analogues are useful compounds for treating cancers in which there is a relationship between the hormone(s) and growth and/or lack of growth of the cancer. Antitumor hormones and hormonal analogues may be employed in combination with the compounds of the invention in the compositions and methods described above. Examples of hormones and hormonal analogues believed to be useful in the treatment of neoplasms include, but are not limited to antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen, toremifene, raloxifene, fulvestrant, iodoxyfene and droloxifene; anti-androgens; such as flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide and cyproterone acetate; adrenocorticosteroids such as prednisone and prednisolone; aminoglutethimide and other aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole, letrazole, vorazole, and exemestane; progestrins such as megestrol acetate; 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride; and gonadotropin- releasing hormones (GnRH) and analogues thereof, such as Leutinizing Hormone- releasing Hormone (LHRH) agonists and antagonists such as goserelin luprolide, leuprorelin and buserelin. \n\n Retinoid(s) are compounds that bind to and activate at least one retinoic acid receptor selected from RARα, RARβ, and RARy and/or compounds that bind to and activate at least one of RARα, RARβ, and RARy and also at least one retinoic X receptor (RXR), including RXRα, RXRβ, and RXRy. Retinoids for use in the present invention typically have affinity for RAR, and particularly for RARα and/or RARβ. However, certain synthetic retinoids, such as 9-cis-retinoic acid also have affinity for both RAR and RXR. In one embodiment, the retinoid has affinity for RARα (and RARα agonist).

Non-receptor kinases and agents, which inhibit non-receptor tyrosine kinase function, are described in Sinha, S. and Corey, SJ. , (1999) J. Hematother. Stem Cell Res. 8:465-80; and Bolen, J. B. and Brugge, J. S., (1997) Λnnu. Rev. of Immunol. 15:371-404.\n\n\nSH2/SH3 domain blockers are agents that disrupt SH2 or SH3 domain binding in a variety of enzymes or adaptor proteins including, but not limited to, PI3-K p85 subunit, Src family kinases, adaptor molecules (She, Crk, Nek, Grb2) and Ras-GAP.

Such inhibitors include, but are not limited to, inhibitors of farnesyltransferase, geranyl-geranyl transferase, and CAAX proteases as well as anti- sense oligonucleotides, ribozymes and immunotherapy. Such inhibitors have been shown to block Ras activation in cells containing mutant Ras, thereby acting as antiproliferative agents.\n\n\nInhibitors of kinases involved in the IGF-1 R signaling axis may also be useful in combination with the compounds of the present invention. Such inhibitors include but are not limited to inhibitors of JNK1/2/3, PI3K, AKT and MEK, and 14.3.3 signaling inhibitors.

One particular AKT inhibitor disclosed therein is \n\n 4-(2-(4-amino-1 ,2,5-oxadiazol-3-yl)-1-ethyl-7-{[(3S)-3-piperidinylmethyl]oxy}-1 H- imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-4-yl)-2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol.\n\n\nCell cycle signaling inhibitors, including inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) are also useful in combination with the compounds of the invention in the compositions and methods described above. Examples of cyclin dependent kinases, including CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 and inhibitors for the same are described in, for instance, Rosania G. R., et al., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents (2000) 10:215-230.\n\n\nReceptor kinase angiogenesis inhibitors may also find use in the present invention.\n\n\nInhibitors of angiogenesis related to VEGFR and TIE-2 are discussed above in regard to signal transduction inhibitors (both are receptor tyrosine kinases). Other inhibitors may be used in combination with the compounds of the invention. For example, anti-VEGF antibodies, which do not recognize VEGFR (the receptor tyrosine kinase), but bind to the ligand; small molecule inhibitors of integrin (alpha\nv\n betas) that inhibit angiogenesis; endostatin and angiostatin (non-RTK) may also prove useful in combination with the compounds of the invention. One example of a VEGFR antibody is bevacizumab (AVASTI N®).\n\n\nInhibitors of phosphatidyl inositol-3-OH kinase family members including blockers of PI3- kinase, ATM, DNA-PK, and Ku may also be useful in combination with the present invention.\n\n\nAlso of potential use in combination with the compounds of the invention are myo- inositol signaling inhibitors such as phospholipase C blockers and myoinositol analogues.\n\n\nsiRNA, RNAi, locked nucleic acid polynucleotides, and antisense therapies may also be used in combination with the compounds of the invention.

Immunotherapeutic regimens include ex-vivo and in-vivo approaches to increasing immunogenicity of patient tumor cells such \n\n as transfection with cytokines (eg. IL-2, IL-4, GMCFS and MCFS), approaches to increase T-cell activity, approaches with transfected immune cells and approaches with anti-idiotypic antibodies. Another potentially useful immunotherapeutic regimen is monoclonal antibodies with wild-type Fc receptors that may illicit an immune response in the host (e.g., IGF-1 R monoclonal antibodies).\n\n\nAgents used in proapoptotic regimens (e.g., Bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides) may also be used in combination with the compounds of the invention. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins block apoptosis. Upregulation of Bcl-2 has therefore been linked to chemoresistance. Studies have shown that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (i.e., mcl-1 ). Therefore, strategies designed to downregulate the expression of Bcl-2 in tumors have demonstrated clinical benefit and are now in Phase ll/lll trials, namely Genta's G3139 bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide. Such proapoptotic strategies using the antisense oligonucleotide strategy for Bcl-2 are discussed in Water, J. S., et al., J. CHn. Oncol. (2000) 18:1812- 1823; and Kitada, S., et al., Antisense Res. Dev. (1994) 4:71-79.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention may be prepared using the processes described below.

For example a compound of formula (I) wherein R\n4\n is -R\n5\n-SO\n2\nR\n6\n, Or -R\n5\nNR\n6\nR\n7\n may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (I\n2\n) wherein R4 is alkenyl with a thiol or amine, respectively. Reaction conditions for such transformations are known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nCompounds of formula (I) wherein R\n4\n is -OR\n6\n, are prepared by reacting a compound of formula (VIII) with a suitable alcohol.\n\n\n \n\n wherein all variables are as defined above.\n\n\nSpecific examples of suitable alcohols include but not limited to methanol, ethanol, n- propanol or n-butanol.

When R\n10\n is halo (preferably chloro), the reaction is generally performed in a solvent or neat. Suitable solvents include but are not limited to isopropanol, methanol, 1 ,4-dioxane, ethanol, dimethylacetamide, triflouroethanol, and N,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction is typically carried out at a temperature of from about 30 to about 12O\n0\nC, or optionally in a microwave apparatus.

The reaction is typically carried out without the addition of other solvents and at temperatures of about 60 \n0\nC to about 120 \n0\nC, in a sealed reaction vessel or optionally in a microwave apparatus. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art of organic chemistry, it may also be desirable to install appropriate protecting groups prior to reacting the compound of formula (VIII) with the compound of formula (IX). For example, in the embodiment, wherein R\n4\n is a group containing a pendant primary or secondary amine, the addition is preferably carried out when the pendant amine is protected as, for example, its corresponding t-butyl carbamate or trifluoracetamide. The choice, installation and removal of appropriate protecting groups for reactions such as this is conventional in the art. Compounds of formula (IX) are commercially available or may be synthesized using techniques conventional in the art.\n\n\nWhen R\n10\n is thiomethyl, the thiomethyl may first be converted to a more suitable leaving group, for example sulfoxide, sulfone, or chloride. The thiomethyl can be converted into a sulfoxide or sulfone by oxidation with an appropriate oxidizing agent, for example oxone, sodium periodate, or mefa-chloroperbenzoic acid, in an appropriate solvent, for example dichloromethane, methanol, or water. Those skilled in the art will recognize that this will produce an analogue of the compound of formula (VIII) in which R\n10\n is a sulfoxide or sulfone. The oxidized product can then be reacted with the compound of formula (IX) to prepare a compound of formula (I).\n\n\nThese reactions are generally performed in a suitable solvent, for example 2-propanol, dimethylacetamide, or dioxane, optionally with the addition of acid, for example hydrochloric acid, and at a temperature of 25-1 1O\n0\nC, preferably 70-90\n0\nC, or in a microwave reactor at a temperature of 90-220\n0\nC, preferably 160-190\n0\nC. \n\n Alternately, the pyrimidinyl sulfoxide or sulfone can be converted to the corresponding hydroxyl pyrimidine by reaction with an appropriate aqueous acid, for example hydrochloric acid or acetic acid, at a temperature of 25-11 O\n0\nC, preferably 70-90\n0\nC. The hydroxyl pyrimidine can then be converted to a chloride using an appropriate chlorinating reagent, for example phosphorous oxychloride or thionyl chloride, optionally in a solvent, for example dichloromethane, at a temperature of 25-12O\n0\nC, preferably 60-80\n0\nC. Those skilled in the art will recognize that this process will produce a compound of formula (VIII) wherein R\n10\n is chloro, which can be reacted with a compound of formula (IX) as described above.\n\n\nCompounds of formula (VIII) may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula (Xl) with a suitable brominating reagent, particularly bromine or NBS, followed by reacting with one of: 1 ) a thiourea, 2) a formamide 3) an amide 4) a thioamide or 5) a urea depending upon whether the thiazole or oxazole and which particular substituents R\n3\n, are desired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein all variables are as defined above.\n\n\nIn this and subsequent Schemes, reference to thiourea, formamide, amide, thioamide or urea in connection with this type of reaction refers to unsubstituted thiourea, formamide, amide, thioamide or urea and substituted analogs thereof. In particular, the thiourea, formamide, amide, thioamide or urea may be substituted with the desired group R\n3\n. Suitably substituted analogs of thiourea, formamide, amide, thioamide or urea are commercially available or may be prepared using conventional techniques.\n\n\nWhen an aminothiazole (i.e., the compound of formula (VIII) wherein W is S and R\n3\n is -NR\n6\nR\n7\n or Het is desired, the reaction can be accomplished by the initial bromination of a compound of formula (Xl) using an appropriate brominating reagent, for example bromine in solvent such as acetic acid or NBS. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe reaction is typically carried out in an appropriate solvent, for example dichloromethane, N,N-dimethylformamide, or N,N-dimethylacetamide, and at a temperature of 25-5O\n0\nC, particularly 25\n0\nC. The brominated analog (i.e., a compound of formula (Xl-A)) is then reacted with an appropriately substituted thiourea.\n\n\n \n\n wherein W is S, R\n3a\n is -NR\n6\nR\n7\n or Het and all other variables are as defined above.\n\n\nThe reaction is typically carried out in an appropriate solvent, for example, N, N- dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, or acetonitrile, optionally in the presence of a suitable base, for example magnesium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate, and at a temperature of 25-9O\n0\nC, particularly 25-5O\n0\nC. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the thiourea can be unsubstituted, thus resulting in a compound of formula (VIII) wherein R\n3\n is NH\n2\n; or the thiourea may bear one or more additional substituents on one of the nitrogen atoms.\n\n\nIn this and subsequent reactions, a compound, such as a compound of formula (VIII), wherein R\n3\n is an amino group (i.e., -NR\n6\nR\n7\n), may be further converted to a corresponding compound wherein R\n3\n is other than amino (or substituted amino) using the techniques described herein and those conventional in the art.\n\n\nFor example, the aminothiazole compound of formula (VIII-A) wherein R\n3\n is an amino group, may be converted to an unsubstituted thiazole (i.e., a compound of formula (VIII) wherein R\n3\n is H) using methods familiar to those of skill in the art. For example, the thiazole may be prepared by reacting the aminothiazole with an appropriate reagent, for example f-butyl nitrite, in an appropriate solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran, and at a temperature of 35-75\n0\nC, particularly 40-60\n0\nC. \n\n When a substituted thiazole is desired, an aminothiazole of formula (VIII) may be modified according to methods that will be familiar to those skilled in the art. For example, the aminothiazole compound of formula (VIII-A) may be converted to a compound of formula (VIII-B) by reaction with reagents capable of replacing the amino group with a halide, preferably a bromide.\n\n\n \n\n wherein Hal is halo, preferably Br; and all other variables are as defined above.\n\n\nThe conversion to a halo-thiazole of formula (VIII-B) may be carried out by reaction with for example, f-butyl nitrite and copper (II) bromide in a suitable solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile, and at a temperature from -1O\n0\nC to 5O\n0\nC, preferably O\n0\nC to 25\n0\nC. The halo-thiazole of formula (VIII-B), may then be reacted under a variety of conditions known to those in the art to produce different thiazole compounds of formula (VIII-C) wherein R\n3\n can be a variety of substituents consistent with the definition of R\n3\n in reference to compounds of Formula (I).\n\n\nOne example of such a reaction is similar to the method of J. Tsuji \"Palladium Reagents and Catalysts: Innovations in Organic Synthesis\", Wiley, Chichester, UK, 1995, involving reaction of the halo-thiazole of formula (VIII-B) with a reagent capable of undergoing palladium-based coupling to prepare compounds of formula (VIII-C) wherein R\n3c\n is alkyl, haloalkyl, or alkenyl.\n\n\n \n\n wherein Hal is halogen;\n\n\nR\n3c\n is alkyl, haloalkyl or alkyl-OH; and all other variables are as defined above. \n\n For example the halo-thiazole of formula (VIII-B) may be reacted with a boronic acid, boronate ester, alkyl tin, alkyl zinc or Grignard reagent, in an appropriate solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, or dimethylformamide, in the presence of a catalyst capable of inducing such a transformation, particularly a palladium catalyst, for example palladiumdicholorobistriphenylphosphine, and at a temperature of 25-15O\n0\nC, preferably 25-6O\n0\nC. Those skilled in the art will recognize that these coupling reactions will often require the addition of a suitable base, such as aqueous sodium carbonate, cesium carbonate, or triethylamine and/or the addition of a suitable ligand for the palladium species, for example a trialkylphosphine or a triarylphosphine, for example triphenylphosphine.\n\n\nAnother example of such a reaction involves the reaction of the halo-thiazole of formula (V-B) with a reagent capable of displacing the bromide, for example an amine, such as piperidine, methylamine, or methyl piperazine.\n\n\n \n\n wherein Hal is halogen;\n\n\nR\n3d\n is -NR\n6\nR\n7\n; and all other variables are as defined above.\n\n\nIn the case of reacting a halo-thiazole of formula (VIII-B) with an amine or substituted amine (e.g., dimethylamine) the reaction is generally performed by reacting the compound of formula (V-B) with the amine or substituted amine optionally in a suitable solvent, such as 2-propanol, dioxane, or dimethylformamide, at a temperature of 25\n0\nC to 15O\n0\nC, preferably 50-90\n0\nC, optionally in the presence of a suitable acid, for example hydrochloric acid.\n\n\nAccording to another process of producing a substituted thiazole of formula (VIII), a compound of formula (Xl-A) is reacted with a thioamide, for example thioacetamide, to prepare a compound of formula (VIII-D) wherein R\n3d\n is alkyl. \n\n \n\n\n wherein all variables are as defined above.\n\n\nAlkyl substituted thioamides for use in this process are commercially available or may be prepared using conventional techniques. Typically, the reaction is carried out in an appropriate solvent, for example, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, or acetonitrile, particularly dimethylformamide or N, N- dimethylacetamide, optionally in the presence of a suitable base, for example magnesium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate, and at a temperature of 35-100\n0\nC, preferably 50-80\n0\nC.\n\n\nIn the embodiment wherein an oxazole of formula (VIII) is desired wherein R is H, the reaction can be accomplished by reacting the compound of formula (Xl-A) with formamide in the presence of an acid, such as sulfuric acid, and at a temperature of 60- 15O\n0\nC, preferably 90-130\n0\nC.\n\n\n \n\n wherein all variables are as defined above.\n\n\nA substituted oxazole of formula (VIII-F) may be prepared from the compound of formula (Xl-A).\n\n\n \n\n wherein R\n3e\n is Het or -NR\n6\nR\n7\n and all other variables are as defined above. \n\n The reaction may be carried out by reacting the compound of formula (Xl-A) with urea or substituted urea in an appropriate solvent, for example, Λ/,Λ/-dimethylformamide, N, N- dimethylacetamide dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, or acetonitrile, optionally in the presence of a suitable base, for example magnesium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate, and at a temperature of 25-17O\n0\nC, particularly 60-150\n0\nC or in a microwave reactor at a temperature of 100-190\n0\nC, particularly 120-160\n0\nC. Those skilled in the art will envision substituted ureas that may be employed in the foregoing method to prepare compounds of formula (VIII-F) wherein R\n3e\n is as defined above. One example of a substituted urea for use in this method is 1-pyrrolidinecarboxamide. Suitable substituted ureas are commercially available or can be made using techniques known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nA substituted oxazole of formula (VIII-G), may also be prepared from a compound of formula (Xl-A).\n\n\n \n\n wherein R\n3f\n is alkyl or haloalkyl and all other variables are as defined above.\n\n\nTypically, the reaction may be carried out by reacting the compound of formula (Xl-A) with an amide (i.e., a compound of formula R\n3f\n-C(O)NH\n2\n), for example acetamide, in an appropriate solvent, for example, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, or acetonitrile, particularly dimethylformamide or neat, optionally in the presence of a suitable base, for example magnesium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate, and at a temperature of 35-17O\n0\nC, preferably 60-150\n0\nC or in a microwave reactor at a temperature of 100-19O\n0\nC, particularly 130-17O\n0\nC.

B-Raf Enzyme Assay:\n\n\nCompounds of the present invention were tested for B-Raf protein serine kinase inhibitory activity in a B-Raf Accelerated MEK ATPase assay (BRAMA). Baculovirus- expressed His6-tagged BRAFV600E full-length (amino acids 2-766) was used in the \n\n BRAMA assay. The BRAMA assay is a high sensitivity assay which measures an intrinsic MEK-mediated ATP hydrolysis uncoupled from downstream ERK phosphorylation by coupling the formation of ADP to NADH oxidation through the enzymes pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. When ADP production is initiated by addition of catalytic amounts of an activated Raf enzyme and non-phosphorylated MEK, one observes robust ADP production concomitant with Raf-mediated phosphorylation of MEK.

Dose dependent tumor inhibition using compound of Example 58a A375P F1 1s were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Penicillin-streptomycin and 1% sodium pyruvate. Tumor cells (2 x10\n6\n A375P F11 s) were implanted subcutaneously into the right flank of athymic mice on Day 1. To facilitate theirgrowth, A375P F11 s cells were suspended in Matrigel diluted 1 :1 in phosphate-buffered saline before implantation. When tumors had reached approximately 200 mm\n3\n in volume (Day 19-22), tumor-bearing mice were randomized into study groups (n=7 or 8). Animals were dosed orally once or twice daily for a 14-day period. The compound of Example 58a was dosed in a 0.5% HPMC/0.2% Tween 80 pH 7-8 vehicle. Tumor growth was measured twice a week using calipers for the duration of the study. Tumor volumes were calculated as a product of (length x width x width)/2 and \n\n median values were used to compare groups. Complete regressions (CR) were defined as three consecutive tumor measurements of ≤ 13.5 mm\n3\n. Partial regressions were defined as three consecutive measurements of < 50% of starting tumor volume. Tumor growth delay was defined as the difference in time taken for treated and control groups to reach 1000 mm\n3\n (T-C1000).\n\n\nIn the following table:\n\n\n\"-\" indicates no response\n\n\n\"+\" indicates growth delay (1-2x doubling)\n\n\n\"++\" indicates growth delay (>2x doubling)\n\n\n\"+++\" indicates stable disease\n\n\n\"++++\" indicates partial regression\n\n\n\"+++++\" indicates complete regression\n\n\nTable 5 - In vivo Evaluation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Pharmacodynamic effect of various compounds\n\n\nActivity of select exemplified compounds was tested in vivo against A375PF11 s (melanoma cell line encoding a B-Raf V600E mutation) xenograft mouse model. The A375P F1 1s cell line, encoding a mutation for BRAF\nV600E\n, was subcloned from the A375P human melanoma cell line (obtained from ATCC, Cat # CRL-1619) by limiting dilution and selected based on high (90%) sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor, SB-590885 (commercially available), in 3-day proliferation assays. The selected clone (A375P F11 s) was isolated and mutation in B-Raf (T 1799A) encoding the V600E amino acid change was reconfirmed. \n\n Female CD-1 nu/nu mice of 8-10 weeks in age were used in these studies; all mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, DE). Animals were housed in pathogen free conditions and handled with aseptic technique. A375P F1 1s were harvested from culture flasks by exposure to 0.25% trypsin/EDTA for 5 min at 37°C. Detached cells were collected, centrifuged (1500 rpm, 5 min, 4°C) and rinsed to remove the trypsin solution. Cells were resuspended in PBS without magnesium or calcium and counted. Cells were spun as previously to remove PBS and a single cell suspension was created either in 50% Matrigel: 50% PBS (v:v) or 100% PBS so that a 100 μL subcutaneous injection would deliver the required number of cells per mouse. The A375P F1 1s melanoma line was injected with Matrigel at 4 million cells per mouse. Tumors were established (-150-300 mm\n3\n) for all cell lines within 2-4 weeks post- injection.\n\n\nCompounds of examples 24, 25, 26, 57, 58, 59, 64, 65, 66, and 156 were prepared in formulations of either 0.5% HPMC/0.2% TWEEN 80 ph 7-8 or 20% encapsin/1%DMSO. The preparations were administered orally to the mice as a single oral dose of 100mg/kg.\n\n\nAt 2h following oral administration of compound mice were euthanized using carbon dioxide. Tumors were carefully excised, homogenized using Medimachine (BD\n\n\nBioscience) with 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 2 mM EGTA (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 % SDS, 50 mM Na-B-PO4, 2 mM NaVO4, 4 mM Na-Pyr-PO4, 2x phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. Crude homogenate was transferred to a 12 ml polypropylene tube containing 1.5 ml of lysis buffer and kept on ice. Following homogenization of all samples, 1 ml of homogenate was transferred to an eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. Five hundred microliter of clarified lysate was transferred to a new tube, flash frozen and processed for quantitation of pERK and tERK using western blot or Elisa (MSD) assays. Before the ratio of pERK/tERK was determined and to ensure linear range, a BSA standard curve was made by performing serial /4-fold dilution to reach concentrations of 20, 13.3, 8.9, 5.9, 3.9, 2.6, 1.7, 1.2, 0.8, 0.5, 0 μg/μl. BioRad dye was added to BSA dilutions and diluted test lysates. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and read on the SpectraMax plate reader at 595 nM. Comparison to the standard curve provides a relative measurement of protein concentration. For determination of pERK/tERK ratio by \n\n western blot analysis 50 μg microgram of tumor lysates were electrophoresed on Invitrogen 4-12% bis-Tris HCI SDS-PAGE. The gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using the iBlot transfer apparatus, which were then blocked and incubated with different primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Western blots dually probed against pERK and tERK were scanned using LI-COR Odyssey® reader. A ratio of the immunofluorescent density obtained for pERK/tERK is calculated and expressed as a ratio (in percentage) to control untreated samples. For determination of pERK/tERK ratio by ELISA, MesoScale Discovery (MSD) (cat# K15107) plate were used according to manufacturer's instructions. In brief, MSD plates were block with 150 μl /well of blocking buffer for 1 hr before being washed 4 times with 200 μl of washing buffer. Thirty microliter (30 μl) of serially diluted samples was added to wells and plates were incubated overnight at 4°C under slow agitation (-500 rpm). Plates were washed 4 times in 200 μl 1X Tris wash buffer and 25 μl detection antibody solution was added to all wells and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr (-500 rpm). Plates were washed 4 times in 200 μl wash buffer and 150μl of read buffer was added to all wells. Plates were read on MSD.SI6000. In this assay vehicle and compound treated samples were tested at 4 different dilutions to allow linear range coverage of the assay. From pERK and tERK signal, background (BSA signal) was subtracted and ratio of pERK/tERK determined and normalized to untreated vehicle samples, arbitrarily set at 100%.\n\n\nInhibition of pERK by B-Raf inhibitors is a good pharmacodynamic marker (PD marker) for BRAF inhibition. The compounds of examples 24, 25, 26, 57, 58, 59, 64, 65, 66, and 156 exhibited inhibition of pERK (pERK/tERK) of equal to or greater than 30%.\n\n\n3. Efficacy in vivo study in mouse.\n\n\nOf the 10 compounds tested for inhibition of pERK, in C.2 above, eight of the compounds (compounds described in example numbers 24, 26, 58, 59, 64, 65, 66, and 156) were tested in an efficacy study similar to study D.1 above. The results demonstrate that six of the eight tested compounds caused tumor regression (mean tumor volume smaller after 14 day treatment than initial tumor volume) or stable disease (mean tumor volume similar after 14day treatment to initial mean tumor volume) compared to vehicle treated animals. \n\n Pharmaceutical Formulation Example --Preparation of Capsules Containing a Compound of the Invention (freebase): ■ Contents in each capsule:\n\n\n=60 mg Active Pharmaceutical ingredient (API) + 60 mg Avicel + 13 mg SSG. ■ 133 mg total powder in a size 0 hard gelatin capsule.

The diffraction patterns of Figures 1 , 3 and 5 were obtained with a PANalytical diffractometer system utilizing copper K X-radiation and equipped with automated divergent slits, nickel filter, and a real time multiple strip detector. The powder sample used to generate the X-ray powder diffraction data was mounted on a silicon zero background plate. In Figures 1, 3 and 5, 2 theta angles in degrees (x-axis) is plotted against peak intensity (y-axis). The XRD pattern for each form of Example No. 58, 64 and 65 is unique to the particular form; \n\n exhibiting a unique set of diffraction peaks which can be expressed in 2 theta angles (), d-spacings (A) and/or relative peak intensities.\n\n\nSince some margin of error is possible in the assignment of 2 theta angles and d- spacings, the preferred method of comparing XRD patterns in order to identify a particular form of a sample is to overlay the XRD pattern of the unknown sample over the XRD pattern of a known form. For example, one skilled in the art can overlay an XRD pattern of an unknown sample of Example No. 58, obtained using the methods described herein, over Figure 1 and, using expertise and knowledge in the art, readily determine whether the XRD pattern of the unknown sample is substantially the same as the XRD pattern of Form 1 of Example No. 58. If the XRD pattern is substantially the same as Figure 1, the previously unknown form can be readily and accurately identified as Form 1 of Example No. 58. The same method may be used to compare a sample of an unknown form of Example Nos. 64 and 65 with Figures 3 and 5.\n\n\nAlthough 2 theta angles or d-spacings are the primary method of identifying a particular crystalline form, it may be desirable to also compare relative peak intensities. As noted above, relative peak intensities may vary depending upon the specific diffractometer employed and the analyst's sample preparation technique. The peak intensities are reported as intensities relative to the peak intensity of the strongest peak. The intensity units on the XRD are counts/sec. The absolute counts = counts/time x count time = counts/sec x 10 sec.\n\n\nDifferential Scanning Calorimetry of Form 1 of Example Nos. 58, 64 and 65. Differential scanning calorimetry was carried out on TA Instruments DSC Q100 DSC system. Heating rate of 10\n0\nC per minute. Sample size 0.4-1.5 mg. The thermograms are provided at Figures 2, 4, and 6, respectively.\n\n\nAs an additional aspects, the present invention provides a particular solid state form, identified as \"Form 1\" of N-{3-[5-(2-amino-4-pyrimidinyl)-2-(1 ,1-dimethylethyl)-1 ,3-thiazol- 4-yl]-2-fluorophenyl}-2,6-difluorobenzenesulfonamide; a particular solid state form identified as \"Form 1\" of N-{3-[5-(2-amino-4-pyrimidinyl)-2-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)- 1 ,3-thiazol-4-yl]-2-fluorophenyl}-2,6-difluorobenzenesulfonamide; and a particular solid state form identified as \"Form 1 \" of N-{3-[2-(1 ,1-dimethylethyl)-5-(2-methyl-4-pyrimidinyl)- 1 ,3-thiazol-4-yl]-2-fluorophenyl}-2,5-difluorobenzenesulfonamide."
