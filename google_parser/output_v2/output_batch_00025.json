Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is concerned with macrocylic compounds having inhibitory activity on the replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It further concerns compositions comprising these compounds as active ingredients as well as processes for preparing these compounds and compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHepatitis C virus is the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide and has become a focus of considerable medical research. HCV is a member of the \nFlaviviridae\n family of viruses in the \nhepacivirus\n genus, and is closely related to the \nflavivirus\n genus, which includes a number of viruses implicated in human disease, such as dengue virus and yellow fever virus, and to the animal \npestivirus\n family, which includes bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). HCV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, with a genome of around 9,600 bases. The genome comprises both 5' and 3' untranslated regions which adopt RNA secondary structures, and a central open reading frame that encodes a single polyprotein of around 3,010-3,030 amino acids. The polyprotein encodes ten gene products which are generated from the precursor polyprotein by an orchestrated series of co- and posttranslational endoproteolytic cleavages mediated by both host and viral proteases. The viral structural proteins include the core nucleocapsid protein, and two envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2. The non-structural (NS) proteins encode some essential viral enzymatic functions (helicase, polymerase, protease), as well as proteins of unknown function. Replication of the viral genome is mediated by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, encoded by non-structural protein 5b (NS5B). In addition to the polymerase, the viral helicase and protease functions, both encoded in the bifunctional NS3 protein, have been shown to be essential for replication of HCV RNA. In addition to the NS3 serine protease, HCV also encodes a metalloproteinase in the NS2 region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing the initial acute infection, a majority of infected individuals develop chronic hepatitis because HCV replicates preferentially in hepatocytes but is not directly cytopathic. In particular, the lack of a vigorous T-lymphocyte response and the high propensity of the virus to mutate appear to promote a high rate of chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis can progress to liver fibrosis leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma), making it the leading cause of liver transplantations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are 6 major HCV genotypes and more than 50 subtypes, which are differently distributed geographically. HCV type 1 is the predominant genotype in Europe and the US. The extensive genetic heterogeneity of HCV has important diagnostic and clinical implications, perhaps explaining difficulties in vaccine development and the lack of response to therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransmission of HCV can occur through contact with contaminated blood or blood products, for example following blood transfusion or intravenous drug use. The introduction of diagnostic tests used in blood screening has led to a downward trend in post-transfusion HCV incidence. However, given the slow progression to the end-stage liver disease, the existing infections will continue to present a serious medical and economic burden for decades.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCurrent HCV therapies are based on (pegylated) interferon-alpha (IFN-α) in combination with ribavirin. This combination therapy yields a sustained virologic response in more than 40% of patients infected by genotype 1 viruses and about 80% of those infected by genotypes 2 and 3. Beside the limited efficacy on HCV type 1, this combination therapy has significant side effects and is poorly tolerated in many patients. Major side effects include influenza-like symptoms, hematologic abnormalities, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Hence there is a need for more effective, convenient and better tolerated treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, two peptidomimetic HCV protease inhibitors have gained attention as clinical candidates, namely BILN-2061 disclosed in \n \nWO00/59929\n \n and VX-950 disclosed in \n \nWO03/87092\n \n. A number of similar HCV protease inhibitors have also been disclosed in the academic and patent literature. It has already become apparent that the sustained administration of BILN-2061 or VX-950 selects HCV mutants which are resistant to the respective drug, so called drug escape mutants. These drug escape mutants have characteristic mutations in the HCV protease genome, notably D168V, D168A and/or A156S. Accordingly, additional drugs with different resistance patterns are required to provide failing patients with treatment options, and combination therapy with multiple drugs is likely to be the norm in the future, even for first line treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExperience with HIV drugs, and HIV protease inhibitors in particular, has further emphasized that sub-optimal pharmacokinetics and complex dosage regimes quickly result in inadvertent compliance failures. This in turn means that the 24 hour trough concentration (minimum plasma concentration) for the respective drugs in an HIV regime frequently falls below the IC\n90\n or ED\n90\n threshold for large parts of the day. It is considered that a 24 hour trough level of at least the IC\n50\n, and more realistically, the IC\n90\n or ED\n90\n, is essential to slow down the development of drug escape mutants. Achieving the necessary pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism to allow such trough levels provides a stringent challenge to drug design. The strong peptidomimetic nature of prior art HCV protease inhibitors, with multiple peptide bonds poses pharmacokinetic hurdles to effective dosage regimes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is a need for HCV inhibitors which may overcome the disadvantages of current HCV therapy such as side effects, limited efficacy, the emerging of resistance, and compliance failures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention concerns HCV inhibitors which are superior in one or more of the following pharmacological related properties, i.e. potency, decreased cytotoxicity, improved pharmacokinetics, improved resistance profile, acceptable dosage and pill burden.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention concerns inhibitors of HCV replication, which can be represented by formula (\nI\n):\n\n \n \n\nand the \nN\n-oxides, salts, and stereoisomers thereof, wherein\n\nthe dashed line represents an optional double bond between atoms C7 and C8;\n\n\nR\n1\n \n is hydrogen or C\n1-6\nalkyl;\n\n\nR\n2\n \n is hydrogen or C\n1-6\nalkyl; and\n\n\nn\n is 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention concerns two subgroups of inhibitors of HCV replication, which can be represented by formula (I-a) and (I-b):\n\n \n \n\nand the \nN\n-oxides, salts, and stereoisomers thereof, wherein\n\n\nR\n1\n, R\n2\n \n and \nn\n are as defined herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further relates to methods for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I), the \nN\n-oxides, addition salts, and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, its intermediates, and the use of the intermediates in the preparation of the compounds of formula (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention relates to the compounds of formula (I) \nper se,\n the \nN\n-oxides, addition salts, and stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, for use as a medicament. The invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a carrier and an anti-virally effective amount of a compound of formula (I) as specified herein. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise combinations of the aforementioned compounds with other anti-HCV agents. The invention further relates to the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions for administration to a subject suffering from HCV infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to the use of a compound of formula (I), or a \nN\n-oxide, addition salt, or stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament for inhibiting HCV. replication. Or the disclosure relates to a method of inhibiting HCV replication in a warm-blooded animal said method comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of formula (I), or a \nN\n-oxide, addition salt, quaternary amine, metal complex, or stereochemically isomeric forms thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used in the foregoing and hereinafter, the following definitions apply unless otherwise noted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein \"C\n1-6\nalkyl\" as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as for example methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, 1-butyl, 2-butyl, 2-methyl-1-propyl, 1-pentyl, 2-pentyl, 3-pentyl, 1-hexyl, 2-hexyl, 2-methyl-1-butyl, 2-methyl-1-pentyl, 2-ethyl-1-butyl, 3-methyl-2-pentyl, and the like. Of interest amongst C\n1-6\nalkyl is C\n1-4\nalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhenever used hereinafter, the term \"compounds of formula (I)\", or \"the present compounds\" or similar terms, it is meant to include the compounds of formula (I), each and any of the subgroups thereof, their \nN\n-oxides, addition salts, and stereochemically isomeric forms. One embodiment comprises the compounds of formula (I) or any subgroup of compounds of formula (I) specified herein, as well as the \nN\n-oxides, salts, as the possible stereoisomeric forms thereof. Another embodiment comprises the compounds of formula (I) or any subgroup of compounds of formula (I) specified herein, as well as the salts as the possible stereoisomeric forms thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) have several centers of chirality and exist as stereochemically isomeric forms. The term \"stereochemically isomeric forms\" as used herein defines all the possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded by the same sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not interchangeable, which the compounds of formula (I) may possess.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith reference to the instances where (\nR\n) or (\nS\n) is used to designate the absolute configuration of a chiral atom within a substituent, the designation is done taking into consideration the whole compound and not the substituent in isolation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound encompasses the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, which said compound may possess. Said mixture may contain all diastereomers and/or enantiomers of the basic molecular structure of said compound. All stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of the present invention both in pure form or mixed with each other are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates as mentioned herein are defined as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the same basic molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates. In particular, the term \"stereoisomerically pure\" concerns compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of at least 80% (i.e. minimum 90% of one isomer and maximum 10% of the other possible isomers) up to a stereoisomeric excess of 100% (i.e. 100% of one isomer and none of the other), more in particular, compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of 90% up to 100%, even more in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 94% up to 100% and most in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 97% up to 100%. The terms \"enantiomerically pure\" and \"diastereomerically pure\" should be understood in a similar way, but then having regard to the enantiomeric excess, and the diastereomeric excess, respectively, of the mixture in question.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates of this invention may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For instance, enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids or bases. Examples thereof are tartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, ditoluoyltartaric acid and camphosulfonic acid. Alternatively, enantiomers may be separated by chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably, if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diastereomeric racemates of the compounds of formula (I) can be obtained separately by conventional methods. Appropriate physical separation methods that may advantageously be employed are, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some of the compounds of formula (I), their \nN\n-oxides, salts, solvates, and the intermediates used in the preparation thereof, the absolute stereochemical configuration was not experimentally determined. A person skilled in the art is able to determine the absolute configuration of such compounds using art-known methods such as, for example, X-ray diffraction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention is also intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring on the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Isotopes of carbon include C-13 and C-14.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"prodrug\" as used throughout this text means the pharmacologically acceptable derivatives such as esters, amides and phosphates, such that the resulting \nin vivo\n biotransformation product of the derivative is the active drug as defmed in the compounds of formula (I). The reference by \nGoodman and Gilman (The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 8th ed, McGraw-Hill, Int. Ed. 1992, \"\nBiotransformation of Drugs\n\", p 13-15\n) describing prodrugs generally is hereby incorporated. Prodrugs preferably have excellent aqueous solubility, increased bioavailability and are readily metabolized into the active inhibitors \nin vivo.\n Prodrugs of a compound of the present invention may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either by routine manipulation or \nin vivo,\n to the parent compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred are pharmaceutically acceptable ester prodrugs that are hydrolysable \nin vivo\n and are derived from those compounds of formula (I) having a hydroxy or a carboxyl group.

Examples of α-acyloxyalkyl ethers include acetoxy-methoxy and 2,2-dimethylpropionyloxy-methoxy. A selection of \nin vivo\n hydrolysable ester forming groups for hydroxy include alkanoyl, benzoyl, phenylacetyl and substituted benzoyl and phenylacetyl, alkoxycarbonyl (to give alkyl carbonate esters), dialkylcarbamoyl and N-(dialkylaminoethyl)-N-alkylcarbamoyl (to give carbamates), dialkylaminoacetyl and carboxyacetyl. Examples of substituents on benzoyl include morpholino and piperazino linked from a ring nitrogen atom via a methylene group to the 3- or 4-position of the benzoyl ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the counter-ion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases which are non-pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutically acceptable acid and base addition salts as mentioned hereinabove are meant to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid and base addition salt forms which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form.

Appropriate base salt forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkali and earth alkaline metal salts, e.g. the lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium salts and the like, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, \nN\n-methyl-D-glucamine, hydrabamine salts, and salts with amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term addition salt as used hereinabove also comprises the solvates which the compounds of formula (I) as well as the salts thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are for example hydrates, alcoholates and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"quaternary amine\" as used hereinbefore defines the quaternary ammonium salts which the compounds of formula (I) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (I) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted alkyl halide, aryl halide or arylalkyl halide, e.g. methyl iodide or benzyl iodide.

Such metalated derivatives of the compounds of formula (I) are intended to be included within the scope of the present disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the compounds of formula (I) may also exist in their tautomeric form. Such forms although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, the compounds of formula (I) have several asymmetric centers. In order to more efficiently refer to each of these asymmetric centers, the numbering system as indicated in the following structural formula will be used.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAsymmetric centers are present at positions 1, 4 and 6 of the macrocycle as well as at the carbon atom 3' in the pyrrolidine ring. Each of these asymmetric centers can occur in their R or S configuration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe stereochemistry at position 1 preferably corresponds to that of an L-amino acid configuration, i.e. that of L-proline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) include a cyclopropyl group as represented in the structural fragment below:\n\n \n \n\nwherein C\n7\n represents the carbon at position 7 and carbons at position 4 and 6 are asymmetric carbon atoms of the cyclopropane ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNotwithstanding other possible asymmetric centers at other segments of the compounds of the invention, the presence of these two asymmetric centers means that the compounds can exist as mixtures of diastereomers, such as the diastereomers of compounds of formula (I) wherein the carbon at position 7 is configured either syn to the carbonyl or syn to the amide as shown below.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne embodiment concerns compounds of formula (I) wherein the carbon at position 7 is configured syn to the carbonyl.

Preferred are the compounds of formula (I) wherein the substituent at the 1 (or 5') position and the substituent at position 3' are in a trans configuration. Of particular interest are the compounds of formula (I) wherein position 1 has the configuration corresponding to L-proline and the substituent at position 3' is in a trans configuration in respect of position 1. Preferably the compounds of formula (I) have the stereochemistry as indicated in the structure of formula (I-c) below:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferably, the dashed line is a double bond between carbon atoms 7 and 8 in the compounds of formula (I), (I-c) or in any subgroup of compounds of formula (I).

One of the steps involves a cyclization whereby the macrocycle is formed.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis procedures described hereinafter are meant to be applicable for as well the racemates, stereochemically pure intermediates or end products, as any stereoisomeric mixtures. The racemates or stereochemical mixtures may be separated into stereoisomeric forms at any stage of the synthesis procedures. In one embodiment, the intermediates and end products have the stereochemistry specified above in the compounds of formula (I-c).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, compounds (I) are prepared by first forming the amide bonds and subsequent forming the double bond linkage between P3 and P1 with concomitant cyclization to the macrocycle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, compounds (I) wherein the bond between C\n7\n and C\n8\n is a double bond, which are compounds of formula (I-a), as defined above, may be prepared by as outlined in the following reaction scheme:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormation of the macrocycle can be carried out via an olefin metathesis reaction in the presence of a suitable metal catalyst such as e.g. the Ru-based catalyst reported by \nMiller, S.J., Blackwell, H.E., Grubbs, R.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118, (1996), 9606-9614\n; \nKingsbury, J. S., Harrity, J. P. A., Bonitatebus, P. J., Hoveyda, A. H., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, (1999), 791-799\n; and \nHuang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, (1999), 2674-2678\n; for example a Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAir-stable ruthenium catalysts such as bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)-3-phenyl-1H-inden-1-ylidene ruthenium chloride (Neolyst M1\n®\n) or bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)-[(phenylthio)methylene]ruthenium (IV) dichloride can be used Other catalysts that can be used are Grubbs first and second generation catalysts, i.e. Benzylidene-bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)dichlororuthenium and (1,3-bis-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2-imidazolidinylidene)dichloro(phenylmethylene)-(tricyclohexylphosphine)ruthenium, respectively. Of particular interest are the Hoveyda-Grubbs first and second generation catalysts, which are dichloro(o-isopropoxyphenylmethylene)(tricyclohexylphosphine)-ruthenium(II) and 1,3-bis-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2-imidazolidinylidene)dichloro(\no-\nisopropoxyphenylmethylene)ruthenium respectively. Also other catalysts containing other transition metals such as Mo can be used for this reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe metathesis reactions may be conducted in a suitable solvent such as for example ethers, e.g. THF, dioxane; halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichoromethane, CHCl\n3\n, 1,2-dichloroethane and the like. In a preferred embodiment, the metathesis reaction is conducted in toluene. These reactions are conducted at increased temperatures under nitrogen atmosphere.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (I) wherein the link between C7 and C8 in the macrocycle is a single bond, i.e. compounds of formula (I-b), can be prepared from the compounds of formula (I-a) by a reduction of the C7-C8 double bond in the compounds of formula (I-a). This reduction may be conducted by catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence of a noble metal catalyst such as, for example, Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru or Raney nickel. Of interest is Rh on alumina. The hydrogenation reaction preferably is conducted in a solvent such as, e.g. an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, or an ether such as THF, or mixtures thereof Water can also be added to these solvents or solvent mixtures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tail P1' can be connected to the P1 building block at any stage of the synthesis, i.e. before or after the cyclization, or before or after the cyclization and reduction as explained herein above. P1' can be linked to P1 by forming an amide bond between both moieties. In one embodiment, the P1' group is introduced in the last step of the synthesis of the compounds (I) as outlined in the following reaction scheme wherein G represents a group:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this procedure, a cyclopropylsulfonamide (IV) is reacted with an intermediate (III) via an amide forming reaction such as any of the procedures for the formation of an amide bond described hereinafter. In particular, (III) may be treated with a coupling agent, for example \nN\n,\nN\n'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), EEDQ, IIDQ, EDCI or benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (commercially available as PyBOP®), in a solvent like THF, followed by reaction with the desired cyclopropylsulfonamide (IV) in the presence of a base for example a trialkylamine such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, or 1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) or diisopropylethylamine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activation of the carboxylic acid in (III) as described in the above reactions may lead to an internal cyclization reaction to an azalactone intermediate of formula\n\n \n \n\nwherein R\n1\n and n are as specified above and wherein the stereogenic centers may have the stereochemical configuration as specified above, in particular as in (I-c). The intermediates (III-a) can be isolated from the reaction mixture, using conventional methodology, and the isolated intermediate (III-a) is then reacted with (IV), or the reaction mixture containing (III-a) can be reacted further with (IV) without isolation of (III-a). In one embodiment, where the reaction with the coupling agent is conducted in a water-immiscible solvent, the reaction mixture containing (III-a) may be washed with water or with slightly basic water in order to remove all water-soluble side products. The thus obtained washed solution may then be reacted with (IV) without additional purification steps. The isolation of intermediates (III-a) on the other hand may provide certain advantages in that the isolated product, after optional further purification, may be reacted with (IV), giving rise to less side products and an easier work-up of the reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) can also be prepared by etherifying an intermediate (V) with a quinoline of formula (VI) as outlined in the following reaction scheme:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nX in (VI) represents hydroxy or a leaving group such as a halide, e.g. bromide or chloride, or an arylsulfonyl group, e.g. mesylate, triflate or tosylate and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the reaction of (V) with (VI) is an O-arylation reaction and X represents a leaving group. This reaction can be conducted following the procedures described by \nE. M. Smith et al. (J. Med. Chem. (1988), 31, 875-885\n). In particular, this reaction is conducted in the presence of a base, preferably a strong base, in a reaction-inert solvent, e.g. one of the solvents mentioned for the formation of an amide bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, starting material (V) is reacted with quinoline (VI) in the presence of a base which is strong enough to detract a hydrogen from the hydroxy group, for example an alkali of alkaline metal hydride such as LiH or sodium hydride, or alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium or potassium methoxide or ethoxide, potassium \ntert-\nbutoxide, in a reaction inert solvent like a dipolar aprotic solvent, e.g. DMA, DMF and the like. The resulting alcoholate is reacted with the arylating agent (VII), wherein X is a suitable leaving group as mentioned above. The conversion of (V) to (I) using an O-arylation reaction does not change the stereochemical configuration at the carbon bearing the hydroxy or -O-quinoline group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the reaction of (V) with (VI) can also be conducted via a Mitsunobu reaction (\nMitsunobu, 1981, Synthesis, January, 1-28\n; \nRano et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 22, 3779-3792\n; \nKrchnak et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 5, 6193-6196\n; \nRichter et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1994, 35, 27, 4705-4706\n). This reaction comprises treatment of intermediate (V) with quinoline (VI) wherein X is hydroxyl, in the presence of triphenylphosphine and an activating agent such as a dialkyl azocarboxylate, e.g. diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD), diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (DIAD) or the like. The Mitsunobu reaction changes the stereochemical configuration at the carbon bearing the hydroxy or -O-quinoline group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) wherein R\n1\n is hydrogen, said compounds being represented by (I-d) can also be prepared from a corresponding nitrogen-protected intermediate (VII) wherein PG represents a nitrogen protecting group. Suitable N-protecting groups are described hereinafter. In one embodiment, PG in (VII) is benzyl or substituted benzyl, in particular 4-methoxybenzyl.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe starting materials (VII) in the above reaction can be prepared following the procedures described for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I), but using intermediates wherein the group R\n1\n is PG.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, in order to prepare the compounds of formula (I), first an amide bond between building blocks P2 and P1 is formed, followed by coupling of the P3 building block to the P1 moiety in P1-P2, and a subsequent amide bond formation between P3 and the P2 moiety in P2-P1-P3 with concomitant ring closure. Yet again, the tail P1' can be bonded to the P1 building block at any stage of the synthesis of the compounds of formula (I), for example before or after coupling the building blocks P2 and P1; before or after coupling the P3 building block to P1; or before or after coupling building blocks P3 and P2 and the concomitant ring closure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another alternative synthetic methodology is the formation of an amide bond between building blocks P2 and P3, followed by the coupling of building block P1 to P3, and a last amide bond formation between P1 and P2 with concomitant ring closure. Yet again, the tail P1' can be bonded to the P1 building block at any stage of the synthesis of the compounds of formula (I), i.e. in the present case, before or after coupling the building blocks P2 and P3; before or after coupling the building blocks P1 and P3; before or after coupling P1 and P2 with concomitant ring closure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBuilding blocks P1 and P3 can be linked via double bond formation at carbons 7 and 8, if desired, followed by a reduction of the C7-C8 double bond. The thus formed P1-P3 block can be coupled to building block P2 and subsequently cyclized, by forming amide bonds. In a preferred embodiment, building block P1-P3 is not reduced and coupled as such with P2 and cyclized, yielding compounds (I-1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBuilding blocks P1 and P3 in any of the previous approaches can be linked via double bond formation, e.g. by the olefin metathesis reaction described hereinafter, or a Wittig type reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be noted that in compounds of formula (I), the amide bond formation between blocks P2 and P3 may be accomplished at two different positions of the urea moiety. A first amide bond formation encompasses reacting the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine ring with the adjacent activated carbonyl (marked with an asterisk) being part of the P3 building block. An alternative second amide bond formation involves the reaction of the asterisked activated carbonyl being part of the P2 building block with an NHRR\n1\n group, wherein R\n1\n is as defined for the compounds of formula (I) or a subgroup thereof, and wherein R\n1\n may further be a nitrogen-protecting group; and R is the P3 alkyl moiety. The activated asterisked carbonyl can be introduced by reacting the pyrrolidine or amine NHRR\n1\n with phosgene or a phosgene derivative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe individual building blocks can first be prepared and subsequently coupled together or alternatively, precursors of the building blocks can be coupled together and modified at a later stage to the desired molecular composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe functionalities in each of the building blocks may be protected to avoid side reactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formation of amide bonds can be carried out using standard procedures such as those used for coupling amino acids in peptide synthesis. The latter involves the dehydrative coupling of a carboxyl group of one reactant with an amino group of the other reactant to form a linking amide bond. The amide bond formation may be performed by reacting the starting materials in the presence of a coupling agent or by converting the carboxyl functionality into an active form such as an active ester, mixed anhydride or a carboxyl acid chloride or bromide. General descriptions of such coupling reactions and the reagents used therein can be found in general textbooks on peptide chemistry, for example, \nM. Bodanszky, \"\nPeptide Chemistry\n\", 2nd rev. ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, (1993\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of coupling reactions with amide bond formation include the azide method, mixed carbonic-carboxylic acid anhydride (isobutyl chloroformate) method, the carbodiimide (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or water-soluble carbodiimide such as \nN\n-ethyl-\nN\n'-[(3-dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide) method, the active ester (\np\n-nitrophenyl ester, \nN\n-hydroxysuccinic imido ester) method, the Woodward reagent K-method, the 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI or N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole) method, the phosphorus reagents or oxidation-reduction methods. Some of these methods can be enhanced by adding suitable catalysts, e.g. in the carbodiimide method by adding 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene), or 4-DMAP. Further coupling agents are (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)-tris-(dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, either by itself or in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or 4-DMAP; or 2-(1\nH\n-benzotriazol-1-yl)-\nN\n,\nN\n,\nN\n',\nN\n'-tetra-methyluronium tetrafluoroborate, or O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-\nN\n,\nN\n,\nN\n',\nN\n'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate. These coupling reactions can be performed in either solution (liquid phase) or solid phase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred amide bond formation is performed employing N-ethyloxycarbonyl-2-ethyloxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) or N-isobutyloxy-carbonyl-2-isobutyloxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (IIDQ). Unlike the classical anhydride procedure, EEDQ and IIDQ do not require base nor low reaction temperatures. Typically, the procedure involves reacting equimolar amounts of the carboxyl and amine components in an organic solvent (a wide variety of solvents can be used). Then EEDQ or IIDQ is added in excess and the mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe coupling reactions preferably are conducted in an inert solvent, such as halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, chloroform, dipolar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, DMSO, HMPT, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn many instances the coupling reactions are done in the presence of a suitable base such as a tertiary amine, e.g. triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), \nN\n-methylmorpholine, \nN\n-methylpyrrolidine, 4-DMAP or 1,8-diazabicycle[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). The reaction temperature may range between 0 °C and 50 °C and the reaction time may range between 15 min and 24 h.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe functional groups in the building blocks that are linked together may be protected to avoid formation of undesired bonds. Appropriate protecting groups that can be used are listed for example in \nGreene, \"\nProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\n\", John Wiley & Sons, New York (1999\n) and \"\nThe Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology\", Vol. 9, Academic Press, New York (1987\n), hereafter referred to simply as Greene. Carboxyl groups can be protected as an ester that can be cleaved off to give the carboxylic acid. Protecting groups that can be used include 1) alkyl esters such as methyl, trimethylsilyl and \ntert\n-butyl; 2) arylalkyl esters such as benzyl and substituted benzyl; or 3) esters that can be cleaved by a mild base or mild reductive means such as trichloroethyl and phenacyl esters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino groups can be protected by a variety ofN-protecting groups, such as:\n\n \n \n \n1) acyl groups such as formyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, and \np\n-toluenesulfonyl;\n \n2) aromatic carbamate groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyls, and 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc);\n \n3) aliphatic carbamate groups such as \ntert\n-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), ethoxycarbonyl, diisopropylmethoxy-carbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl;\n \n4) cyclic alkyl carbamate groups such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl and adamantyloxycarbonyl;\n \n5) alkyl groups such as triphenylmethyl, benzyl or substituted benzyl such as 4-methoxybenzyl;\n \n6) trialkylsilyl such as trimethylsilyl or t.Bu dimethylsilyl; and\n \n7) thiol containing groups such as phenylthiocarbonyl and dithiasuccinoyl. Interesting amino protecting groups are Boc and Fmoc.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nPreferably the amino protecting group is cleaved off prior to the next coupling step. Removal of N-protecting groups can be done following art-known procedures. When the Boc group is used, the methods of choice are trifluoroacetic acid, neat or in dichloromethane, or HCl in dioxane or in ethyl acetate. The resulting ammonium salt is then neutralized either prior to the coupling or in situ with basic solutions such as aqueous buffers, or tertiary amines in dichloromethane or acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. When the Fmoc group is used, the reagents of choice are piperidine or substituted piperidine in dimethylformamide, but any secondary amine can be used. The deprotection is carried out at a temperature between 0 °C and room temperature, usually around 15-25 °C, or 20-22 °C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther functional groups that can interfere in the coupling reactions of the building blocks may also be protected. For example hydroxyl groups may be protected as benzyl or substituted benzyl ethers, e.g. 4-methoxybenzyl ether, benzoyl or substituted benzoyl esters, e.g. 4-nitrobenzoyl ester, or with trialkylsilyl goups (e.g. trimethylsilyl or \ntert\n-butyldimethylsilyl).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther amino groups may be protected by protecting groups that can be cleaved off selectively. For example, when Boc is used as the α-amino protecting group, the following side chain protecting groups are suitable: p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) moieties can be used to protect further amino groups; benzyl (Bn) ethers can be used to protect hydroxy groups; and benzyl esters can be used to protect further carboxyl groups. Or when Fmoc is chosen for the α-amino protection, usually \ntert\n-butyl based protecting groups are acceptable. For instance, Boc can be used for further amino groups; \ntert-\nbutyl ethers for hydroxyl groups; and \ntert\n-butyl esters for further carboxyl groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the protecting groups may be removed at any stage of the synthesis procedure but preferably, the protecting groups of any of the functionalities not involved in the reaction steps are removed after completion of the build-up of the macrocycle. Removal of the protecting groups can be done in whatever manner is dictated by the choice of protecting groups, which manners are well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intermediates of formula (II) may be prepared by reacting an intermediate (VIII) with an alkenamine (IX) in the presence of a carbonyl introducing agent as outlined in the following reaction scheme.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nL represents an O-protecting group PG\n1\n or a group\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe O-protecting group can be any of the groups mentioned herein and in particular is a benzoyl or substituted benzoyl group such as 4-nitrobenzoyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarbonyl (CO) introducing agents include phosgene, or phosgene derivatives such as carbonyl diimidazole (CDI), and the like. In one embodiment (VIII) is reacted with the CO introducing agent in the presence of a suitable base and a solvent, which can be the bases and solvents used in the amide forming reactions as described above. In a particular embodiment, the base is a hydrogencarbonate, e.g. NaHCO\n3\n or a tertiary amine such as triethylamine and the like, and the solvent is an ether or halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. THF, CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, CHCl\n3\n, and the like. Thereafter, the amine (IX) is added thereby obtaining intermediates (XII) or (XII-a) as in the above scheme. An alternative route using similar reaction conditions involves first reacting the CO introducing agent with the amine (IX) and then reacting the thus formed intermediate with (VIII).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere L is PG\n1\n the reaction of (VIII) with (IX) yields intermediates (II-a). These can be deprotected, for example where PG\n1\n is benzoyl or substituted benzoyl by reaction with a an alkali metal hydroxide (LiOH, NaOH, KOH), in particular where PG\n1\n is 4-nitrobenzoyl, with LiOH, in an aqueous medium comprising water and a water-soluble organic solvent such as an alkanol (methanol, ethanol) and THF. The resulting alcohol (i.e. an intermediate (II-a) wherein L is hydrogen), is reacted with an intermediate (VI) as described above for the reaction of (V) with (VI) and this reaction results in intermediates (II).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intermediates of formula (III) may be prepared by first cyclizing an ester intermediate (X) to a macrocyclic ester (XI), which in turn is converted to the corresponding macrocyclic carboxylic acid (III) as follows:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nL is as specified above and PG\n2\n is a carboxyl protecting group, e.g. one of the carboxyl protecting groups mentioned above, in particular a C\n1-4\nalkyl or benzyl ester, e.g. a methyl, ethyl or t.butyl ester. The PG\n1\n group mat be removed using art-known methodologies, e.g. methyl or ethyl esters by treatment with an alkali metal hydroxide in an aqueous medium, t.butyl esters with weak acid and benzyl esters with strong acid or by catalytic hydrogenation. Where L is a radical (a) this reaction sequence yields intermediates (III). These can also prepared by removing L being an O-protecting group and etherifying the thus formed alcohol with intermediate (VI) as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intermediates of formula (VII) may be prepared by cyclizing an intermediate (XII) wherein PG is a nitrogen-protecting group as specified above to intermediates (VII) with a double bond in the macrocycle (VII-a), which can be reduced to the corresponding intermediates (VII) with a single bond at that location in the macrocycle (VII-b):\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nL is as specified above. Where L is a radical (a) this reaction sequence yields intermediates (VII-a) or (VII-b). These can also prepared by removing L being an O-protecting group and etherifying the thus formed alcohol with intermediate (VI) as described above. The sulfonylamide group in the above sequence may be an ester (i.e. an -OPG\n2\n group as specified above) which may be removed and condensed with a cyclopropylamide (IV) following the procedures mentioned earlier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cyclopropylsulfonamide group can be introduced at any stage of the synthesis, either as the last step as described above, or earlier, before the macrocycle formation as shown in the following scheme.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nL is as defined above, PG\n2\n represents a carboxyl protecting group, as specified above, and L\n1\n is a nitrogen-protecting group (PG, as defined above), or L\n1\n is a group\n\n \n \n\n(b), wherein R\n1\n and n are as defined above, or wherein R\n1\n may also represent a nitrogen-protecting group (a group PG, as specified above). Obviously, when R\n1\n represents a nitrogen-protecting group, such may be removed at the desired stage of the synthetic route. The intermediates (XIV) wherein L\n1\n represents a group (b) correspond to the intermediates (II) or (II-a) and may be processed further as specified above.\n\n\n \n\n\nCoupling of P1 and P2 building blocks\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe P1 and P2 building blocks are linked using an amide forming reaction following the procedures described above. The P1 building block may have a carboxyl protecting group PG2 (as in (XVI-a)) or may already be linked to P1' group (as in (XVI-b)). L\n2\n is hydrogen or a group L as specified above.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the procedure of the above scheme, a cyclopropyl amino acid (XVI-a) or (XVI-b) is coupled to the acid function of the P2 building block using an amide forming reaction such as the standard peptide coupling conditions described above. Removal of the acid protection group in (XIII), using the appropriate conditions for the protecting group used, followed by coupling with a cyclopropylsulfonamide (IV) as described above, again yields intermediate (XIV).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, L\n1\n is a group (b) and these reactions involve coupling P1 to P2-P3, which results in the intermediates (X) or (II) mentioned above. In another embodiment, L\n1\n is a N-protecting group PG, which is as specified above, and the coupling reaction results in an intermediate (XV-a) from which the group PG can be removed to intermediates (XIII-a), using reaction conditions also mentioned above:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, PG in this reaction is a BOC group. Where additionally L\n3\n is hydrogen, the starting material is Boc-L-hydroxyproline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe group L\n2\n can be an O-protecting group PG\n1\n which is introduced on the starting material (XV), wherein L\n2\n is hydrogen and which is selectively cleavable towards group PG.\n\n\n \n\n\nCoppling of P3 and P2 building blocks\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe P3 and P2 building blocks are linked using a urea forming reaction following the procedures described above for the coupling of (VII) with (IX). A general procedure is represented in the following reaction scheme wherein L is as specified above and L\n3\n is a group -O-PG\n2\n, or a group\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn (XVIII) R\n1\n is as specified above, but may further be a nitrogen-protecting group, which may be removed with a nitrogen deprotecting agent at the desired stage of the synthetis route. Where L\n3\n in (XVIII) is a group -OPG\n2\n, the PG\n2\n group may be removed and the resulting acid coupled with cyclopropyl amino acids (XVI-a) or (XVI-b), yielding intermediates (XIII) or (XIV) wherein L\n1\n is a radical (b).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe building blocks P1, P1', P2 and P3 for compounds of formula (I) can be prepared starting from art-known intermediates. A number of such syntheses are described hereafter in more detail.\n\n\n \n\n\nSynthesis of P2 building blocks\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBuilding blocks P2 can be prepared by an O-arylation reaction, e.g. following the procedures described above, as depicted in the scheme below, wherein L\n1\n is as specified above and in particular is a N-protecting group PG, X is as defined above and L\n4\n is hydroxy, a group -OPG\n2\n, with PG\n2\n being a carboxyl protecting group, such as any of the carboxyl protecting groups mentioned above; or L\n4\n is a P1 group such as a group (c) or (d) as defined above.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nStarting material (XIX) is reacted with reagent (VI) as described above for the synthesis of (I-d) starting from (V) and (VI). Similarly as described above, this reaction can be done with retention (arylation with X being a leaving group) or inversion (Mitsunobu reaction) of the stereochemistry at the hydroxy bearing carbon atom. In the arylation with X being a leaving group, L\n4\n may also be hydroxy, in the Mitsunobu reaction L\n4\n is a group -OPG\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the group L\n1\n is PG, which is Boc and the starting material (VIII) is commercially available Boc-L-hydroxyproline, or any other stereoisomeric form thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere L\n4\n in (XX) is -OPG\n2\n, the carboxyl protecting group PG\n2\n may be removed following procedures described above to hydroxyproline derivatives (XVII). In one embodiment PG\n1\n is Boc and PG\n2\n is a lower alkyl ester, in particular a methyl or ethyl ester. Hydrolysis of the latter ester to the acid can be done by standard procedures, e.g. acid hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid in methanol or ethanol, or by a metal hydroxide such as sodium or preferably lithium hydroxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intermediates (VI) can be prepared following art-known methods using known starting materials. They may be prepared as shown below:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFriedel-Craft acylation of a 3-methoxyaniline (XXII), available either commercially or via art-known procedures, using an acylating agent such as acetyl chloride or the like in the presence of one or more Lewis acids such as boron trichloride and aluminium trichloride in a solvent like dichloromethane provides (XXIII). Coupling of (XXIII) with 4-isopropyl-thiazole-2-carboxylic acid (XXIV), preferably under basic conditions, such as in pyridine, in the presence of an activating agent for the carboxylate group, for instance POCl\n3\n, followed by ring closure and dehydration under basic conditions like potassium \ntert\n-butoxide in \ntert\n-butanol yields quinoline derivative (VI-a). The latter can be converted to (VI-b) wherein LG is a leaving group, e.g. by reaction of (XII) with a halogenating agent, for example phosphoryl chloride or the like, or with an arylsulfonyl chloride, e.g. with tosyl chloride.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2-carboxy-4-isopropyl-thiazole (XXIV) is synthesized following art-known procedures, in particular as follows:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nEthyl thiooxamate (XXVI) is reacted with the β-bromoketone (XXVII) to form the thiazolyl carboxylic acid ester (XXVIII) which is hydrolyzed to the corresponding acid (XXIV). The ethyl ester in these intermediates may be replaced by other carboxyl protecting groups PG\n2\n, as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntermediate (XXIII) may also be prepared as described by \nBrown et al. J. Med. Chem. 1989, 32, 807- 826\n, or as outlined in the following scheme.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nStarting materials ethylacetyl acetate and ethoxymethylene malononitrile, which are commercially available, are reacted in the presence of a suitable base, such as sodium ethoxide, and a solvent, such as ethanol and the like. This reaction affords intermediate (XXIX). The latter is hydrolyzed, e.g. with a base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, e.g. NaOH or LiOH, in a suitable solvent such as ethanol/water to produce (XXX). Decarboxylation of intermediate (XXX) into intermediate (XXXI) is performed at increased temperature until effervescence ceases, preferably in the presence of a basic solvent such as quinoline. Methylation of intermediate (XXXI), in particular with a methylating agent such as MeI in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. K\n2\nCO\n3\n) in a suitable solvent (such as DMF and the like) yields (XXXII). The latter is reacted with a Grignard reagent such as MeMgBr in the presence of a suitable solvent (e.g. THF), followed by hydrolysis, for instance with aqueous HCl, affording intermediate (XXIII).\n\n\n \n\n\nSynthesis of P1 building blocks\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cyclopropane amino acid used in the preparation of the P1 fragment is commercially available or can be prepared using art-known procedures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino-vinyl-cyclopropyl ethyl ester (XVI-a) may be obtained according to the procedure described in \n \nWO 00/09543\n \n or as illustrated in the following scheme, wherein PG\n2\n is a carboxyl protecting group as specified above:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment of commercially available or easily obtainable imine (XXXIII) with 1,4-dihalobutene in presence of a base produces (XXXIV), which after hydrolysis yields cyclopropyl amino acid (XVI-a), having the allyl substituent \nsyn\n to the carboxyl group. Resolution of the enantiomeric mixture (XVI-a) results in (XVI-a-1). The resolution is performed using art-known procedures such as enzymatic separation; crystallization with a chiral acid; or chemical derivatization; or by chiral column chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sulfonamide derivative (XVI-b) can be obtained as outlined in the following reaction scheme, wherein R\n2\n and PG are as specified above.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction of (XVI-c) with sulfonamide (IV) is an amide forming procedure, which can be performed following the procedures described above. This reaction yields intermediates (XVI-d) from which the amino protecting group is removed by standard methods such as those described above. This in turn results in the desired intermediate (XVI-b). Starting materials (XVI-c) may be prepared from intermediates (XVI-a) by first introducing a N-protecting group PG and subsequent removal of the group PG\n2\n.\n\n\n \n\n\nSynthesis of the P3 building blocks\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe P3 building blocks (IX) can be prepared according to methodologies known in the art. One of these methodologies is shown in the scheme below and starts from protected amines (XXXVI), in particular from monoacylated amines, such as trifluoroacetamide, or from a Boc-protected amine.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this scheme, LG is a N-protecting group as specified above and in particular is BOC or trifluoroacetyl; R\n1\n and n are as defined above, and wherein R\n1\n may also be a further nitrogen-protecting group which can be cleaved off selectively towards the group PG. LG is a leaving group as specified above, in particular LG is chloro or bromo. Where R\n1\n represents a nitrogen-protecting group, it may be removed with a nitrogen deprotecting agent at the desired stage of the synthetic route.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoacylated amines (XXXVI) are treated with a strong base such as sodium hydride and are subsequently reacted with a haloC\n3-8\nalkenyl (XXXVII) to the corresponding protected amine (XXXVIII). Deprotection of (XXXVIII) affords (IX). Deprotection will depend on the group PG, thus if PG is Boc, deprotection can be accomplished with a relatively weak acid, e.g. trifluoroacetic acid, or when PG is trifluoroacetyl, removal is accomplished with a base, e.g. sodium hydroxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntermediates (IX) wherein R\n1\n is hydrogen can also be prepared via a Gabriel synthesis of an alkenylamine, which can be carried out by the treatment of a phthalimide (XXXIX) with a base, such as potassium hydroxide, and (XXXX), followed by the hydrolysis to generate an alkenylamine (IX-a).\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above scheme is LG halogen, n is as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) may be converted to the corresponding \nN\n-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its \nN\n-oxide form. Said \nN\n-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzene-carboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. tert-butyl hydro-peroxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alcohols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. Diastereomers may be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e.g., counter-current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) may be obtained as racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I), which are sufficiently basic or acidic, may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid, respectively chiral base. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali or acid. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound may be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods may advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the present invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) as specified herein, or a compound of any of the subgroups of compounds of formula (I) as specified herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A therapeutically effective amount in this context is an amount sufficient to prophylactically act against, to stabilize or to reduce viral infection, and in particular HCV viral infection, in infected subjects or subjects being at risk of being infected. In still a further aspect, this invention relates to a process of preparing a pharmaceutical composition as specified herein, which comprises intimately mixing a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier with a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), as specified herein, or of a compound of any of the subgroups of compounds of formula (I) as specified herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, the compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form or metal complex, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also be administered via oral inhalation or insufflation by means of methods and formulations employed in the art for administration via this way. Thus, in general the compounds of the present invention may be administered to the lungs in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry powder, a solution being preferred. Any system developed for the delivery of solutions, suspensions or dry powders via oral inhalation or insufflation are suitable for the administration of the present compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition adapted for administration by inhalation or insufflation through the mouth comprising a compound of formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compounds of the present invention may be administered via inhalation of a solution in nebulized or aerosolized doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, suppositories, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) show antiviral properties. Viral infections and their associated diseases treatable using the compounds and methods of the present invention include those infections brought on by HCV and other pathogenic flaviviruses such as Yellow fever, Dengue fever (types 1-4), St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Murray valley encephalitis, West Nile virus and Kunjin virus. The diseases associated with HCV include progressive liver fibrosis, inflammation and necrosis leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and HCC; and for the other pathogenic flaviviruses the diseases include yellow fever, dengue fever, hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis. A number of the compounds of this invention moreover are active against mutated strains of HCV. Additionally, many of the compounds of this invention show a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and have attractive properties in terms ofbioavailability, including an acceptable half-life, AUC (area under the curve) and peak values and lacking unfavorable phenomena such as insufficient quick onset and tissue retention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nin vitro\n antiviral activity against HCV of the compounds of formula (I) was tested in a cellular HCV replicon system based on \nLohmann et al. (1999) Science 285:110-113\n, with the further modifications described by \nKrieger et al. (2001), Journal of Virology 75: 4614-4624\n, which is further exemplified in the examples section. This model, while not a complete infection model for HCV, is widely accepted as the most robust and efficient model of autonomous HCV RNA replication currently available. Compounds exhibiting anti-HCV activity in this cellular model are considered as candidates for further development in the treatment of HCV infections in mammals. It will be appreciated that it is important to distinguish between compounds that specifically interfere with HCV functions from those that exert cytotoxic or cytostatic effects in the HCV replicon model, and as a consequence cause a decrease in HCV RNA or linked reporter enzyme concentration. Assays are known in the field for the evaluation of cellular cytotoxicity based for example on the activity of mitochondrial enzymes using fluorogenic redox dyes such as resazurin. Furthermore, cellular counter screens exist for the evaluation of non-selective inhibition of linked reporter gene activity, such as firefly luciferase. Appropriate cell types can be equipped by stable transfection with a luciferase reporter gene whose expression is dependent on a constitutively active gene promoter, and such cells can be used as a counter-screen to eliminate non-selective inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDue to their antiviral properties, particularly their anti-HCV properties, the compounds of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof, their \nN\n-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines, metal complexes and stereochemically isomeric forms, are useful in the treatment of individuals experiencing a viral infection, particularly a HCV infection, and for the prophylaxis of these infections. In general, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of warm-blooded animals infected with viruses, in particular flaviviruses such as HCV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may therefore be used as medicines. Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises the systemic administration to viral infected subjects or to subjects susceptible to viral infections of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with the viral infection, in particular the HCV infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to the use of the present compounds or any subgroup thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or the prevention of viral infections, particularly HCV infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure furthermore relates to a method of treating a warm-blooded animal infected by a virus, or being at risk of infection by a virus, in particular by HCV, said method comprising the administration of an anti-virally effective amount of a compound of formula (I), as specified herein, or of a compound of any of the subgroups of compounds of formula (I), as specified herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the combination of previously known anti-HCV compound, such as, for instance, interferon-α (IFN-α), pegylated interferon-α and/or ribavirin, and a compound of formula (I) can be used as a medicine in a combination therapy. The term \"combination therapy\" relates to a product containing mandatory (a) a compound of formula (I), and (b) optionally another anti-HCV compound, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in treatment of HCV infections, in particular, in the treatment of infections with HCV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-HCV compounds encompass agents selected from an HCV polymerase inhibitor, an HCV protease inhibitor, an inhibitor of another target in the HCV life cycle, and immunomodulatory agent, an antiviral agent, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHCV polymerase inhibitors include, but are not limited to, NM283 (valopicitabine), R803, JTK-109, JTK-003, HCV-371, HCV-086, HCV-796 and R-1479.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibitors of HCV proteases (NS2-NS3 inhibitors and NS3-NS4A inhibitors) include, but are not limited to, the compounds of \n \nWO02/18369\n \n (see, e.g., page 273, lines 9-22 and page 274, line 4 to page 276, line 11); BILN-2061, VX-950, GS-9132 (ACH-806), SCH-503034, and SCH-6.

The latter preferably are those HIV inhibitors that have a positive effect on drug metabolism and/or pharmacokinetics that improve bioavailabilty. An example of such an HIV inhibitor is ritonavir.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs such, the present invention further provides a combination comprising (a) an HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and (b) ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound ritonavir, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and methods for its preparation are described in \n \nWO94/14436\n \n. For preferred dosage forms of ritonavir, see \n \nUS6,037, 157\n \n, and the documents cited therein: \n \nUS5,484, 801\n \n, \n \nUS08/402,690\n \n, and \n \nWO95/07696\n \n and \n \nWO95/09614\n \n. Ritonavir has the following formula:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, the combination comprising (a) an HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and (b) ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; further comprises an additional anti-HCV compound selected from the compounds as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a combination as described herein, comprising the step of combining an HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. An alternative embodiment of this invention provides a process wherein the combination comprises one or more additional agent as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combinations of the present invention may be used as medicaments. Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises the systemic administration to HCV-infected subjects of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with HCV and other pathogenic flavi- and pestiviruses.

Bioavailability is defined as the fraction of administered dose reaching systemic circulation. t\n1/2\n represents the half life or time taken for the plasma concentration to fall to half its original value. C\nss\n is the steady state concentration, i.e. the concentration at which the rate of input of drug equals the rate of elimination. C\nmin\n is defined as the lowest (minimum) concentration measured during the dosing interval. C\nmax\n, represents the highest (maximum) concentration measured during the dosing interval. AUC is defined as the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for a defined period of time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combinations of this invention can be administered to humans in dosage ranges specific for each component comprised in said combinations. The components comprised in said combinations can be administered together or separately. The NS3/4a protease inhibitors of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof, and ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, may have dosage levels of the order of 0.02 to 5.0 grams-per-day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) and ritonavir are administered in combination, the weight ratio of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) \nto\n ritonavir is suitably in the range of from about 40:1 to about 1:15, or from about 30:1 to about 1:15, or from about 15: 1 to about 1: 15, typically from about 10: 1 to about 1:10, and more typically from about 8:1 to about 1:8. Also useful are weight ratios of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors of formula (I) \nto\n ritonavir ranging from about 6:1 to about 1:6, or from about 4:1 to about 1:4, or from about 3:1 to about 1:3, or from about 2:1 to about 1:2, or from about 1.5:1 to about 1:1.5. In one aspect, the amount by weight of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors of formula (I) is equal to or greater than that of ritonavir, wherein the weight ratio of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) to ritonavir is suitably in the range of from about 1: 1 to about 15: 1, typically from about 1: 1 to about 10: 1, and more typically from about 1: 1 to about 8: 1. Also useful are weight ratios of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) \nto\n ritonavir ranging from about 1: 1 to about 6: 1, or from about 1: 1 to about 5: 1, or from about 1: 1 to about 4:1, or from about 3:2 to about 3:1, or from about 1:1 to about 2:1 or from about 1:1 to about 1.5:1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"therapeutically effective amount\" as used herein means that amount of active compound or component or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought, in the light of the present invention, by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease being treated. Since the instant invention refers to combinations comprising two or more agents, the \"therapeutically effective amount\" is that amount of the agents taken together so that the combined effect elicits the desired biological or medicinal response. For example, the therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising (a) the compound of formula (I) and (b) ritonavir, would be the amount of the compound of formula (I) and the amount of ritonavir that when taken together have a combined effect that is therapeutically effective.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general it is contemplated that an antiviral effective daily amount would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg body weight, more preferably from 0.1 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as one, two, three, four or more (sub-)doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said (sub-)doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 1 to 1000 mg, and in particular 5 to 200 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight, sex, extent of disorder and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention. The effective daily amount ranges mentioned hereinabove are therefore only guidelines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to one embodiment, the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) and ritonavir may be co-administered once or twice a day, preferably orally, wherein the amount of the compounds of formula (I) per dose is from about 1 to about 2500 mg, and the amount of ritonavir per dose is from 1 to about 2500 mg.

The assay demonstrated that the compounds of formula (I) exhibited activity against HCV replicons functional in a cell culture. The cellular assay was based on a bicistronic expression construct, as described by \nLohmann et al. (1999) Science vol. 285 pp. 110-113\n with modifications described by \nKrieger et al. (2001) Journal of Virology 75: 4614-4624\n, in a multi-target screening strategy. In essence, the method was as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay utilized the stably transfected cell line Huh-7 luc/neo (hereafter referred to as Huh-Luc). This cell line harbors an RNA encoding a bicistronic expression construct comprising the wild type NS3-NS5B regions of HCV type 1b translated from an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), preceded by a reporter portion (FfL-luciferase), and a selectable marker portion (neo\nR\n, neomycine phosphotransferase). The construct is bordered by 5' and 3' NTRs (non-translated regions) from HCV type 1b. Continued culture of the replicon cells in the presence of G418 (neo\nR\n) is dependent on the replication of the HCV RNA. The stably transfected replicon cells that express HCV RNA, which replicates autonomously and to high levels, encoding \ninter alia\n luciferase, are used for screening the antiviral compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe replicon cells were plated in 384 well plates in the presence of the test and control compounds which were added in various concentrations. Following an incubation of three days, HCV replication was measured by assaying luciferase activity (using standard luciferase assay substrates and reagents and a Perkin Elmer ViewLux\n™\n ultraHTS microplate imager). Replicon cells in the control cultures have high luciferase expression in the absence of any inhibitor. The inhibitory activity of the compound on luciferase activity was monitored on the Huh-Luc cells, enabling a dose-response curve for each test compound. EC\n50\n values were then calculated, which value represents the amount of the compound required to decrease by 50% the level of detected luciferase activity, or more specifically, the ability of the genetically linked HCV replicon RNA to replicate.\n\n\n \n\n\nInhibition assay\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe aim of this \nin vitro\n assay was to measure the inhibition of HCV NS3/4A protease complexes by the compounds of the present invention. This assay provides an indication of how effective compounds of the present invention would be in inhibiting HCV NS3/4A proteolytic activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibition of full-length hepatitis C NS3 protease enzyme was measured essentially as described in Poliakov, 2002 Prot Expression & Purification 25 363 371. Briefly, the hydrolysis of a depsipeptide substrate, Ac-DED(Edans)EEAbuψ[COO]ASK(Dabcyl)-NH\n2\n (AnaSpec, San José, USA), was measured spectrofluorometrically in the presence of a peptide cofactor, KKGSVVIVGRIVLSGK (Åke Engström, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, Sweden). [\nLandro, 1997 #Biochem 36 9340-9348\n]. The enzyme (1 nM) was incubated in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5,10 mM DTT, 40% glycerol, 0.1% n-octyl-D-glucoside, with 25 µM NS4A cofactor and inhibitor at 30 °C for 10 min, whereupon the reaction was initiated by addition of 0.5 µM substrate. Inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO, sonicated for 30 sec. and vortexed. The solutions were stored at - 20°C between measurements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe final concentration of DMSO in the assay sample was adjusted to 3.3%. The rate of hydrolysis was corrected for inner filter effects according to published procedures. [\nLiu, 1999 Analytical Biochemistry 267331-335\n]. Ki values were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis (GraFit, Erithacus Software, Staines, MX, UK), using a model for competitive inhibition and a fixed value for Km (0.15 µM). A minimum of two replicates was performed for all measurements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following Table 1 lists compounds that were prepared according to any one of the above examples.

The basolateral and the apical wells contained 1.5 mL and 0.4 mL of transport buffer (TB), respectively, and the standard concentration of the tested substances was 10 µM. Furthermore all test solutions and buffers contained 1% DMSO. Prior to the experiment the transport plates were pre-coated with culture medium containing 10% serum for 30 minutes to avoid nonspecific binding to plastic material.

After being equilibrated to the buffer system the Transepithelial electrical resistance value (TEER) was measured in each well by an EVOM chop stick instrument. The TEER values were usually between 400 and 1000 Ω per well (depending on the passage number used).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe transport buffer (TB, pH 6.5) was removed from the apical side and the insert was transferred to the 30 minutes row (No. 2) and fresh 425 µL TB (pH 6.5), including the test substance was added to the apical (donor) well. The plates were incubated in a polymix shaker at 37°C with a low shaking velocity of approximately 150 to 300 rpm. After 30 minutes incubation in row 2 the inserts were moved to new pre-warmed basolateral (receiver) wells every 30 minutes; row 3 (60 minutes), 4 (90 minutes) and 5 (120 minutes). 25 µL samples were taken from the apical solution after ~2 minutes and at the end of the experiment. These samples represented donor samples from the start and the end of the experiment. 300 µL were taken from the basolateral (receiver) wells at each scheduled time point and the post value of TEER was measured at the end of the experiment. To all collected samples acetonitrile was added to a final concentration of 50% in the samples.

The transport plate comprised 3 rows of 4 wells. Row 1 was denoted \"wash\" and row 3 was the \"experimental row\". The transport plate had previously been prepared with 1.5 mL TB (pH 7.4) in wash row No. 1 and with 1.55 mL TB (pH 7.4), including the test substance, in experimental row No. 3 (donor side).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n0.5 mL transport buffer (HBSS, 25 mM MES, pH 6.5) was added to the inserts in row No. 1 and the cell monolayers were equilibrated in the transport buffer system for 30 minutes, 37°C in a polymix shaker. After being equilibrated to the buffer system the TEER value was measured in each well by an EVOM chop stick instrument.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe transport buffer (TB, pH 6.5) was removed from the apical side and the insert was transferred to row 3 and 400 µL fresh TB, pH 6.5 was added to the inserts. After 30 minutes 250 µL was withdrawn from the apical (receiver) well and replaced by fresh transport buffer. Thereafter 250 µL samples were withdrawn and replaced by fresh transport buffer every 30 minutes until the end of the experiment at 120 minutes, and finally a post value of TEER was measured at the end of the experiment. A 25 µL sample was taken from the basolateral (donor) compartment after ∼2 minutes and at the end of the experiment. These samples represented donor samples from the start and the end of the experiment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo all collected samples acetonitrile was added to a final concentration of 50% in the samples.

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is concerned with macrocyclic compounds having inhibitory activity on the replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It further concerns compositions comprising these compounds as active ingredients as well as processes for preparing these compounds and compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHepatitis C virus is the leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide and has become a focus of considerable medical research. HCV is a member of the \nFlaviviridae\n family of viruses in the \nhepacivirus\n genus, and is closely related to the \nflavivirus\n genus, which includes a number of viruses implicated in human disease, such as dengue virus and yellow fever virus, and to the animal \npestivirus\n family, which includes bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). HCV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, with a genome of around 9,600 bases. The genome comprises both 5' and 3' untranslated regions which adopt RNA secondary structures, and a central open reading frame that encodes a single polyprotein of around 3,010-3,030 amino acids. The polyprotein encodes ten gene products which are generated from the precursor polyprotein by an orchestrated series of co- and posttranslational endoproteolytic cleavages mediated by both host and viral proteases. The viral structural proteins include the core nucleocapsid protein, and two envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2. The non-structural (NS) proteins encode some essential viral enzymatic functions (helicase, polymerase, protease), as well as proteins of unknown function. Replication of the viral genome is mediated by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, encoded by non-structural protein 5b (NS5B). In addition to the polymerase, the viral helicase and protease functions, both encoded in the bifunctional NS3 protein, have been shown to be essential for replication of HCV RNA. In addition to the NS3 serine protease, HCV also encodes a metalloproteinase in the NS2 region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing the initial acute infection, a majority of infected individuals develop chronic hepatitis because HCV replicates preferentially in hepatocytes but is not directly cytopathic. In particular, the lack of a vigorous T-lymphocyte response and the high propensity of the virus to mutate appear to promote a high rate of chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis can progress to liver fibrosis leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma), making it the leading cause of liver transplantations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are 6 major HCV genotypes and more than 50 subtypes, which are differently distributed geographically. HCV type 1 is the predominant genotype in Europe and the US. The extensive genetic heterogeneity of HCV has important diagnostic and clinical implications, perhaps explaining difficulties in vaccine development and the lack of response to therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransmission of HCV can occur through contact with contaminated blood or blood products, for example following blood transfusion or intravenous drug use. The introduction of diagnostic tests used in blood screening has led to a downward trend in post-transfusion HCV incidence. However, given the slow progression to the end-stage liver disease, the existing infections will continue to present a serious medical and economic burden for decades.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCurrent HCV therapies are based on (pegylated) interferon-alpha (IFN-α) in combination with ribavirin. This combination therapy yields a sustained virologic response in more than 40% of patients infected by genotype 1 viruses and about 80% of those infected by genotypes 2 and 3. Beside the limited efficacy on HCV type 1, this combination therapy has significant side effects and is poorly tolerated in many patients. Major side effects include influenza-like symptoms, hematologic abnormalities, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Hence there is a need for more effective, convenient and better tolerated treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecently, two peptidomimetic HCV protease inhibitors have gained attention as clinical candidates, namely BILN-2061 disclosed in \n \nWO00/59929\n \n and VX-950 disclosed in \n \nWO03/87092\n \n. A number of similar HCV protease inhibitors have also been disclosed in the academic and patent literature. It has already become apparent that the sustained administration of BILN-2061 or VX-950 selects HCV mutants which are resistant to the respective drug, so called drug escape mutants. These drug escape mutants have characteristic mutations in the HCV protease genome, notably D168V, D168A and/or A156S. Accordingly, additional drugs with different resistance patterns are required to provide failing patients with treatment options, and combination therapy with multiple drugs is likely to be the norm in the future, even for first line treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExperience with HIV drugs, and HIV protease inhibitors in particular, has further emphasized that sub-optimal pharmacokinetics and complex dosage regimes quickly result in inadvertent compliance failures. This in turn means that the 24 hour trough concentration (minimum plasma concentration) for the respective drugs in an HIV regime frequently falls below the IC\n90\n or ED\n90\n threshold for large parts of the day. It is considered that a 24 hour trough level of at least the IC\n50\n, and more realistically, the IC\n90\n or ED\n90\n, is essential to slow down the development of drug escape mutants. Achieving the necessary pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism to allow such trough levels provides a stringent challenge to drug design.

One embodiment comprises the compounds of formula (I) or any subgroup of compounds of formula (I) specified herein, as well as the \nN-\noxides, salts, as the possible stereoisomeric forms thereof.

The term \"stereochemically isomeric forms\" as used herein defines all the possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded by the same sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not interchangeable, which the compounds of formula (I) may possess.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith reference to the instances where (\nR\n) or \n(S)\n is used to designate the absolute configuration of a chiral atom within a substituent, the designation is done taking into consideration the whole compound and not the substituent in isolation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound encompasses the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, which said compound may possess. Said mixture may contain all diastereomers and/or enantiomers of the basic molecular structure of said compound. All stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of the present invention both in pure form or mixed with each other are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates as mentioned herein are defined as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the same basic molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates.

For instance, enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids or bases. Examples thereof are tartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, ditoluoyltartaric acid and camphosulfonic acid. Alternatively, enantiomers may be separated by chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably, if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe diastereomeric racemates of the compounds of formula (I) can be obtained separately by conventional methods. Appropriate physical separation methods that may advantageously be employed are, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor some of the compounds of formula (I), their \nN-\noxides, salts, solvates, and the intermediates used in the preparation thereof, the absolute stereochemical configuration was not experimentally determined.

The linking of blocks P1 and P3 involves double bond formation. The linking of building blocks P1, P2 and P3 to prepare compounds (I-i) or (I-j) can be done in any given sequence.

J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118, (1996), 9606-9614\n; \nKingsbury, J.S., Harrity, J. P. A., Bonitatebus, P. J., Hoveyda, A. H., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, (1999), 791-799\n; and \nHuang et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, (1999), 2674-2678\n; for example a Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAir-stable ruthenium catalysts such as bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)-3-phenyl-1H-inden-1-ylidene ruthenium chloride (Neolyst M1\n®\n) or bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)-[(phenylthio)methylene]ruthenium (IV) dichloride can be used. Other catalysts that can be used are Grubbs first and second generation catalysts, i.e. Benzylidene-bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)dichlororuthenium and (1,3-bis-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2-imidazolidinylidene)dichloro(phenylmethylene)-(tricyclohexylphosphine)ruthenium, respectively. Of particular interest are the Hoveyda-Grubbs first and second generation catalysts, which are dichloro(\no\n-isopropoxyphenylmethylene)(tricyclohexylphosphine)-ruthenium(II) and 1,3-bis-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2-imidazolidinylidene)dichloro(\no-\nisopropoxyphenylmethylene)ruthenium respectively. Also other catalysts containing other transition metals such as Mo can be used for this reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe metathesis reactions may be conducted in a suitable solvent such as for example ethers, e.g. THF, dioxane; halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichoromethane, CHCl\n3\n, 1,2-dichloroethane and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene. In a preferred embodiment, the metathesis reaction is conducted in toluene. These reactions are conducted at increased temperatures under nitrogen atmosphere.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (I) wherein the link between C7 and C8 in the macrocycle is a single bond, i.e. compounds of formula (I-j), can be prepared from the compounds of formula (I-i) by a reduction of the C7-C8 double bond in the compounds of formula (I-i). This reduction may be conducted by catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen in the presence of a noble metal catalyst such as, for example, Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru or Raney nickel. Of interest is Rh on alumina. The hydrogenation reaction preferably is conducted in a solvent such as, e.g. an alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, or an ether such as THF, or mixtures thereof. Water can also be added to these solvents or solvent mixtures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe R\n1\n group can be connected to the P1 building block at any stage of the synthesis, i.e. before or after the cyclization, or before or after the cyclization and reduction as descibed herein above. The compounds of formula (I) wherein R\n1\n represents -NHSO\n2\nR\n7\n, said compounds being represented by formula (I-k-1), can be prepared by linking the R\n1\n group to P1 by forming an amide bond between both moieties. Similarly, the compounds of formula (I) wherein R\n1\n represents -OR\n6\n, i.e. compounds (I-k-2), can be prepared by linking the R\n1\n group to P1 by forming an ester bond. In one embodiment, the -OR\n6\n groups are introduced in the last step of the synthesis of the compounds (I) as outlined in the following reaction schemes wherein G represents a group:\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntermediate (2a) can be coupled with the amine (2b) by an amide forming reaction such as any of the procedures for the formation of an amide bond described hereinafter. In particular, (2a) may be treated with a coupling agent, for example \nN,N'\n-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), EEDQ, IIDQ, EDCI or benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (commercially available as PyBOP®), in a solvent such as an ether, e.g. THF, or a halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. dichloromethane, chlorophorm, dichloroethane, and reacted with the desired sulfonamide (2b), preferably after reacting (2a) with the coupling agent. The reactions of (2a) with (2b) preferably are conducted in the presence of a base, for example a trialkylamine such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, or 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). Intermediate (2a) can also be converted into an activated form, e.g. an activated form of general formula G-CO-Z, wherein Z represents halo, or the rest of an active ester, e.g. Z is an aryloxy group such as phenoxy, p.nitrophenoxy, pentafluorophenoxy, trichlorophenoxy, pentachlorophenoxy and the like; or Z can be the rest of a mixed anhydride. In one embodiment, G-CO-Z is an acid chloride (G-CO-Cl) or a mixed acid anhydride (G-CO-O-CO-R or G-CO-O-CO-OR, R in the latter being e.g. C\n1-4\nalkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, i.propyl, butyl, t.butyl, i.butyl, or benzyl). The activated form G-CO-Z is reacted with the sulfonamide (2b).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe activation of the carboxylic acid in (2a) as described in the above reactions may lead to an internal cyclization reaction to an azalactone intermediate of formula\n\n \n \n\nwherein X, W, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n R\n5\n, n are as specified above and wherein the stereogenic centers may have the stereochemical configuration as specified above, for example as in (I-a) or (I-b). The intermediates (2a-1) can be isolated from the reaction mixture, using conventional methodology, and the isolated intermediate (2a-1) is then reacted with (2b), or the reaction mixture containing (2a-1) can be reacted further with (2b) without isolation of (2a-1). In one embodiment, where the reaction with the coupling agent is conducted in a water-immiscible solvent, the reaction mixture containing (2a-1) may be washed with water or with slightly basic water in order to remove all water-soluble side products. The thus obtained washed solution may then be reacted with (2b) without additional purification steps. The isolation of intermediates (2a-1) on the other hand may provide certain advantages in that the isolated product, after optional further purification, may be reacted with (2b), giving rise to less side products and an easier work-up of the reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntermediate (2a) can be coupled with the alcohol (2c) by an ester forming reaction. For example, (2a) and (2c) are reacted together with removal of water either physically, e.g. by azeotropical water removal, or chemically by using a dehydrating agent. Intermediate (2a) can also be converted into an activated form G-CO-Z, such as the activated forms mentioned above, and subsequently reacted with the alcohol (2c). The ester forming reactions preferably are conducted in the presence of a base such as an alkali metal carbonate or hydrogen carbonate, e.g. sodium or potassium hydrogen carbonate, or a tertairy amine such as the amines mentioned herein in relation to the amide forming reactions, in particular a trialkylamine, e.g. triethylamine. Solvents that can be used in the ester forming recations comprise ethers such as THF; halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichoromethane, CH\n2\nCl\n2\n; hydrocarbons such as toluene; polar aprotic solvents such as DMF, DMSO, DMA; and the like solvents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) wherein R\n3\n is hydrogen, said compounds being represented by (I-1), can also be prepared by removal of a protecting group PG, from a corresponding nitrogen-protected intermediate (3a), as in the following reaction scheme. The protecting group PG in particular is any of the nitrogen protecting groups mentioned hereinafter and can be removed using procedures also mentioned hereinafter:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe starting materials (3a) in the above reaction can be prepared following the procedures for the preparation of compounds of formula (I), but using intermediates wherein the group R\n3\n is PG.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) can also be prepared by reacting an intermediate (4a) with an aniline (4b) in the presence of a carbamate forming reagent as outlined in the following reaction scheme wherein the various radicals have the meanings specified above:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction of intermediates (4a) with the carbamate forming reagent is conducted in the same solvents and bases as those used for the amide bond formation as described hereinafter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarbamate forming reactions may be conducted using a variety of methods, in particular by reaction of amines with alkyl chloroformates; by reaction of alcohols with carbamoyl chlorides or isocyanates; via reactions involving metal complexes or acyl transfer agents. See for example, \nGreene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M., \"\nProtective Groups in Organic Synthesis\n\"; 1999; Wiley and Sons, p. 309-348\n. Carbon monoxide and certain metal catalysts can be used to synthesize carbamates from several starting compounds, including amines. Metals such as palladium, iridium, uranium, and platinum may be used as catalysts. Methods using carbon dioxide for synthesis of carbamates that have been also been reported, can also be used (see for example, \nYoshida, Y., et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan 1989, 62, 1534\n; and \nAresta, M., et al., Tetrahedron, 1991, 47, 9489\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne approach for the preparation of carbamates involves the use of intermediates\n\n \n \n\nwherein Q is leaving group such as halo, in particular chloro and bromo, or a group used in active esters for amide bond formation, such as those mentioned above, for example phenoxy or substituted phenoxy such as p.chloro and p.nitrophenoxy, trichlorophenoxy, pentachlorophenoxy, N-hydroxy-succinimidyl, and the like. Intermediates (4b) can be derived from alcohols (4a) and phosgene, thus forming a chloroformate, or by transferring the chloro in the latter to intermediates (5a) which are intermediates of formula (5) wherein Q is Q\n1\n. In this and the following reaction procedures, Q\n1\n represents any of the active ester moieties such as those mentioned above. Intermediates (4b) are reacted with (4a), obtaining compounds (I).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntermediates (4b-1), which are intermediates (4b) wherein Q is Q\n1\n, can also be prepared by reacting the alcohol (4a) with carbonates Q\n1\n-CO-Q\n1\n such as e.g. bisphenol, bis-(substituted phenol) or bis N-hydroxy-succinimidyl carbonates:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reagents (5a) may also be prepared from chloroformates C1-CO-Q\n1\n as follows:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above reactions to prepare reagents (4b-1) may be conducted in the presence of the bases and solvents mentioned hereinafter for the synthesis of amide bonds, in particular triethylamine and dichloromethane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, in order to prepare the compounds of formula (I), first an amide bond between building blocks P2 and P1 is formed, followed by coupling of the P3 building block to the P1 moiety in P1-P2, and a subsequent carbamate or ester bond formation between P3 and the P2 moiety in P2-P1-P3 with concomitant ring closure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another alternative synthetic methodology is the formation of an amide bond between building blocks P2 and P3, followed by the coupling of building block P1 to the P3 moiety in P3-P2, and a last amide bond formation between P1 and P2 in P1-P3-P2 with concomitant ring closure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBuilding blocks P1 and P3 can be linked to a P1-P3 sequence. If desired, the double bond linking P1 and P3 may be reduced. The thus formed P1-P3 sequence, either reduced or not, can be coupled to building block P2 and the thus forming sequence P1-P3-P2 subsequently cyclized, by forming an amide bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBuilding blocks P1 and P3 in any of the previous approaches can be linked via double bond formation, e.g. by the olefin metathesis reaction described hereinafter, or a Wittig type reaction. If desired, the thus formed double bond can be reduced, similarly as described above for the conversion of (I-i) to (I-j). The double bond can also be reduced at a later stage, i.e. after addition of a third building block, or after formation of the macrocycle. Building blocks P2 and P1 are linked by amide bond formation and P3 and P2 are linked by carbamate or ester formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tail P1' can be bonded to the P1 building block at any stage of the synthesis of the compounds of formula (I), for example before or after coupling the building blocks P2 and P1; before or after coupling the P3 building block to P1; or before or after ring closure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe individual building blocks can first be prepared and subsequently coupled together or alternatively, precursors of the building blocks can be coupled together and modified at a later stage to the desired molecular composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formation of amide bonds can be carried out using standard procedures such as those used for coupling amino acids in peptide synthesis. The latter involves the dehydrative coupling of a carboxyl group of one reactant with an amino group of the other reactant to form a linking amide bond. The amide bond formation may be performed by reacting the starting materials in the presence of a coupling agent or by converting the carboxyl functionality into an active form such as an active ester, mixed anhydride or a carboxyl acid chloride or bromide. General descriptions of such coupling reactions and the reagents used therein can be found in general textbooks on peptide chemistry, for example, \nM. Bodanszky, \"\nPeptide Chemistry\n\", 2nd rev. ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, (1993\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of coupling reactions with amide bond formation include the azide method, mixed carbonic-carboxylic acid anhydride (isobutyl chloroformate) method, the carbodiimide (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbodiimide, or water-soluble carbodiimide such as \nN-\nethyl-\nN'\n-[(3-dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide) method, the active ester method (e.g. \np\n-nitrophenyl, \np\n-chlorophenyl, trichlorophenyl, pentachloro-phenyl, pentafluorophenyl, \nN-\nhydroxysuccinic imido and the like esters), the Woodward reagent K-method, the 1,1 -carbonyldiimidazole (CDI or N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole) method, the phosphorus reagents or oxidation-reduction methods. Some of these methods can be enhanced by adding suitable catalysts, e.g. in the carbodiimide method by adding 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene), or 4-DMAP. Further coupling agents are (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris-(dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, either by itself or in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or 4-DMAP; or 2-(1\nH\n-benzotriazol-1-yl)-\nN,N,N',N'\n-tetra-methyluronium tetrafluoroborate, or O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-\nN,N,N',N'\n-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate. These coupling reactions can be performed in either solution (liquid phase) or solid phase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred amide bond formation is performed employing N-ethyloxycarbonyl-2-ethyloxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) or N-isobutyloxy-carbonyl-2-isobutyloxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (IIDQ). Unlike the classical anhydride procedure, EEDQ and IIDQ do not require base nor low reaction temperatures. Typically, the procedure involves reacting equimolar amounts of the carboxyl and amine components in an organic solvent (a wide variety of solvents can be used). Then EEDQ or IIDQ is added in excess and the mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe coupling reactions preferably are conducted in an inert solvent, such as halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, chloroform, dipolar aprotic solvents such as acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, DMSO, HMPT, ethers such as tetrahydrofuran (THF).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn many instances the coupling reactions are done in the presence of a suitable base such as a tertiary amine, e.g. triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), \nN-\nmethylmorpholine, \nN-\nmethylpyrrolidine, 4-DMAP or 1,8-diazabicycle[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). The reaction temperature may range between 0 °C and 50 °C and the reaction time may range between 15 min and 24 h.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe functional groups in the building blocks that are linked together may be protected to avoid formation of undesired bonds. Appropriate protecting groups that can be used are listed for example in \nGreene, \"\nProtective Groups in Organic Chemistry\n\", John Wiley & Sons, New York (1999\n) and \"\nThe Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology\", Vol. 3, Academic Press, New York (1987\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarboxyl groups can be protected as an ester that can be cleaved off to give the carboxylic acid. Protecting groups that can be used include 1) alkyl esters such as methyl, trimethylsilyl and \ntert\n-butyl; 2) arylalkyl esters such as benzyl and substituted benzyl; or 3) esters that can be cleaved by a mild base or mild reductive means such as trichloroethyl and phenacyl esters.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino groups can be protected by a variety of N-protecting groups, such as:\n\n \n \n \n1) acyl groups such as formyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, and \np-\ntoluenesulfonyl;\n \n2) aromatic carbamate groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyls, and 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc);\n \n3) aliphatic carbamate groups such as \ntert\n-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), ethoxycarbonyl, diisopropylmethoxy-carbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl;\n \n4) cyclic alkyl carbamate groups such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl and adamantyloxycarbonyl;\n \n5) alkyl groups such as triphenylmethyl, benzyl or substituted benzyl such as 4-methoxybenzyl;\n \n6) trialkylsilyl such as trimethylsilyl or t.Bu dimethylsilyl; and\n \n7) thiol containing groups such as phenylthiocarbonyl and dithiasuccinoyl. Interesting amino protecting groups are Boc and Fmoc.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nPreferably the amino protecting group is cleaved off prior to the next coupling step. Removal of N-protecting groups can be done following art-known procedures. When the Boc group is used, the methods of choice are trifluoroacetic acid, neat or in dichloromethane, or HCl in dioxane or in ethyl acetate. The resulting ammonium salt is then neutralized either prior to the coupling or in situ with basic solutions such as aqueous buffers, or tertiary amines in dichloromethane or acetonitrile or dimethylformamide. When the Fmoc group is used, the reagents of choice are piperidine or substituted piperidine in dimethylformamide, but any secondary amine can be used. The deprotection is carried out at a temperature between 0 °C and room temperature, usually around 15-25 °C, or 20-22 °C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther functional groups that can interfere in the coupling reactions of the building blocks may also be protected. For example hydroxyl groups may be protected as benzyl or substituted benzyl ethers, e.g. 4-methoxybenzyl ether, benzoyl or substituted benzoyl esters, e.g. 4-nitrobenzoyl ester, or with trialkylsilyl goups (e.g. trimethylsilyl or \ntert\n-butyldimethylsilyl).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther amino groups may be protected by protecting groups that can be cleaved off selectively. For example, when Boc is used as the α-amino protecting group, the following side chain protecting groups are suitable: p-toluenesulfonyl (tosyl) moieties can be used to protect further amino groups; benzyl (Bn) ethers can be used to protect hydroxy groups; and benzyl esters can be used to protect further carboxyl groups. Or when Fmoc is chosen for the α-amino protection, usually \ntert\n-butyl based protecting groups are acceptable. For instance, Boc can be used for further amino groups; \ntert-\nbutyl ethers for hydroxyl groups; and \ntert\n-butyl esters for further carboxyl groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the protecting groups may be removed at any stage of the synthesis procedure but preferably, the protecting groups of any of the functionalities not involved in the reaction steps are removed after completion of the build-up of the macrocycle. Removal of the protecting groups can be done in whatever manner is dictated by the choice of protecting groups, which manners are well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intermediates of formula (1a) wherein X is N, said intermediates being represented by formula (1a-1), may be prepared using an urea forming reaction, starting from intermediates (5a) which are reacted with an alkenamine (5b) in the presence of a carbonyl introducing agent as outlined in the following reaction scheme.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarbonyl (CO) introducing agents include phosgene, or phosgene derivatives such as carbonyl diimidazole (CDI), and the like. In one embodiment (5a) is reacted with the CO introducing agent in the presence of a suitable base and a solvent, which can be the bases and solvents used in the amide forming reactions as described above. Thereafter, the amine (5b) is added thereby obtaining intermediates (1a-1) as in the above scheme. In a particular embodiment, the base is a hydrogencarbonate, e.g. NaHCO\n3\n, or a tertiary amine such as triethylamine and the like, and the solvent is an ether or halogenated hydrocarbon, e.g. THF, CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, CHCl\n3\n, and the like. An alternative route using similar reaction conditions involves first reacting the CO introducing agent with the amine (5b) and then reacting the thus formed intermediate with (5a).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intermediates (1a-1) can alternatively be prepared as follows:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nPG\n1\n is an O-protecting group, which can be any of the groups mentioned herein and in particular is a benzoyl or substituted benzoyl group such as 4-nitrobenzoyl. In the latter instance this group can be removed by reaction with a an alkali metal hydroxide (LiOH, NaOH, KOH), in particular where PG\n1\n is 4-nitrobenzoyl, with LiOH, in an aqueous medium comprising water and a water-soluble organic solvent such as an alkanol (methanol, ethanol) and THF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntermediates (6a) are reacted with (5b) in the presence of a carbonyl introducing agent, similar as described above, and this reaction yields intermediates (6c). These are deprotected, in particular using the reaction conditions mentioned above. The resulting alcohol (6d) is reacted with intermediates (4b) in a carbamate forming reaction, as described above for the reaction of (4a) with (4b), and this reaction results in intermediates (1a-1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intermediates of formula (1a) wherein X is C, said intermediates being represented by formula (1a-2), may be prepared by an amide forming reaction starting from intermediates (7a) which are reacted with an alkenamine (5b) as shown in the following reaction scheme, using reaction conditions for preparing amides such as those described above.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intermediates (1a-1) can alternatively be prepared as follows:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nPG\n1\n is an O-protecting group as described above. The same reaction conditions as described above may be used: amide formation as described above, removal of PG\n1\n as in the description of the protecting groups and introduction of R\n8\n as in the reactions of (4a) with the anilines (4b).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intermediates of formula (2a) may be prepared by first cyclizing an open amide (9a) to a macrocyclic ester (9b), which in turn is converted to an intermediate (2a) as follows:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nPG\n2\n is a carboxyl protecting group, e.g. one of the carboxyl protecting groups mentioned above, in particular a C\n1-4\nalkyl or benzyl ester, e.g. a methyl, ethyl or t.butyl ester. The reaction of (9a) to (9b) is a metathesis reaction and is conducted as described above. Removal of PG\n2\n as described above, yields intermediates (2a). Where PG\n1\n is a C\n1-4\nalkyl ester, it is removed by alkaline hydrolysis, e.g. with NaOH or preferably LiOH, in an aqueous solvent, e.g. a C\n1-4\nalkanol/water mixture, such as methanol/water or ethanol/water. A benzyl group can be removed by catalytic hydrogenation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative synthesis, intermediates (2a) can be prepared as follows:\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe PG\n1\n group is selected such that it is selectively cleavable towards PG\n2\n. PG\n2\n may be e.g. methyl or ethyl esters, which can be removed by treatment with an alkali metal hydroxide in an aqueous medium, in which case PG\n1\n e.g. is t.butyl or benzyl. Or alternatively, PG\n2\n may be t.butyl esters removable under weakly acidic conditions or PG\n1\n may be benzyl esters removable with strong acid or by catalytic hydrogenation, in the latter two cases PG\n1\n e.g. is a benzoic ester such as a 4-nitrobenzoic ester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFirst, intermediates (10a) are cyclized to the macrocyclic esters (10b), the latter are deprotected by removal of the PG\n1\n group to intermediates (10c), which are reacted with anilines (4b), followed by removal of the carboxyl protecting group PG\n2\n. The cyclization, deprotection of PG\n1\n and PG\n2\n, and the coupling with (4b) are as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe R\n1\n groups can be introduced at any stage of the synthesis, either as the last step as described above, or earlier, before the macrocycle formation, as illustrated in the following scheme:\n\n \n \n\nIn the above scheme, R\n2\n, R\n6\n, R\n7\n, R\n8\n, X and PG\n2\n are as defined above and L\n1\n is a P3 group\n\n \n \n\nwherein n and R\n3\n are as defined above and where X is N, L\n1\n may also be a nitrogen-protecting group (PG, as defined above) and where X is C, L\n1\n may also be a group -COOPG\n2a\n, wherein the group PG\n2a\n is a carboxyl protecting group similar as PG\n2\n, but wherein PG\n2a\n is selectively cleavable towards PG\n2\n. In one embodiment PG\n2a\n is t.butyl and PG\n2\n is methyl or ethyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intermediates (11c) and (11d) wherein L\n1\n represents a group (b) correspond to the intermediates (1a) and may be processed further as specified above.\n\n\n \n\n\nCoupling of P1 and P2 building blocks\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe P1 and P2 building blocks are linked using an amide forming reaction following the procedures described above. The P1 building block may have a carboxyl protecting group PG\n2\n (as in (12b)) or may already be linked to P1' group (as in (12c)). L\n2\n is a N-protecting group (PG), or a group (b), as specified above. L\n3\n is hydroxy, -OPG\n1\n or a group -O-R\n8\n as specified above. Where in any of the following reaction schemes L\n3\n is hydroxy, prior to each reaction step, it may be protected as a group -OPG\n1\n and, if desired, subsequently deprotected back to a free hydroxy function. Similarly as described above, the hydroxy function may be converted to a group -O-R\n8\n.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the procedure of the above scheme, a cyclopropyl amino acid (12b) or (12c) is coupled to the acid function of the P2 building block (12a) with the formation of an amide linkage, following the procedures described above. Intermediates (12d) or (12e) are obtained. Where in the latter L\n2\n is a group (b), the resulting products are P3-P2-P1 sequences encompassing some of the intermediates (11c) or (11d) in the previous reaction scheme. Removal of the acid protecting group in (12d), using the appropriate conditions for the protecting group used, followed by coupling with an amine H\n2\nN-SO\n2\nR\n7\n (2b) or with HOR\n6\n (2c) as described above, again yields the intermediates (12e), wherein -COR\n1\n are amide or ester groups. Where L\n2\n is a N-protecting group, it can be removed yielding intermediates (5a) or (6a). In one embodiment, PG in this reaction is a BOC group and PG\n2\n is methyl or ethyl. Where additionally L\n3\n is hydroxy, the starting material (12a) is Boc-L-hydroxyproline. In a particular embodiment, PG is BOC, PG\n2\n is methyl or ethyl and L\n3\n is -O-R\n8\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, L\n2\n is a group (b) and these reactions involve coupling P1 to P2-P3, which results in the intermediates (1a-1) or (1a) mentioned above. In another embodiment, L\n2\n is a N-protecting group PG, which is as specified above, and the coupling reaction results in intermediates (12d-1) or (12e-1), from which the group PG can be removed, using reaction conditions mentioned above, obtaining intermediates (12-f) or respectively (12g), which encompass intermediates (5a) and (6a) as specified above:\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the group L\n3\n in the above schemes represents a group -O-PG\n1\n which can be introduced on a starting material (12a) wherein L\n3\n is hydroxy. In this instance PG\n1\n is chosen such that it is selectively cleavable towards group L\n2\n being PG.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a similar way, P2 building blocks wherein X is C, which are cyclopentane or cyclopentene derivatives, can be linked to P1 building blocks as outlined in the following scheme wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, L\n3\n, PG\n2\n and PG\n2a\n are carboxyl protecting groups. PG\n2a\n typically is chosen such that it is selectively cleavable towards group PG\n2\n. Removal of the PG\n2a\n group in (13c) yields intermediates (7a) or (8a), which can be reacted with (5b) as described above.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one particular embodiment, where X is C, R\n2\n is H, and where X and the carbon bearing R\n2\n are linked by a single bond (P2 being a cyclopentane moiety), PG\n2a\n and L\n3\n taken together form a bond and the P2 building block is represented by formula:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nBicyclic acid (14a) is reacted with (12b) or (12c) similar as described above to (14b) and (14c) respectively, wherein the lactone is opened to give intermediates (14c) and (14e). The lactone can be opened using ester hydrolysis procedures, for example using the reaction conditions described above for the alkaline removal of a PG\n1\n group in (9b), in particular using basic conditions such as an alkali metal hydroxide, e.g. NaOH, KOH, in particular LiOH.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntermediates (14c) and (14e) can be processed further as described hereinafter.\n\n\n \n\n\nCoupling of P3 and P2 building blocks\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFor P2 building blocks that have a pyrrolidine moiety, the P3 and P2 or P3 and P2-P1 building blocks are linked using an urea forming reaction following the procedures described above for the coupling of (5a) with (5b). A general procedure for coupling P2 blocks having a pyrrolidine moiety is represented in the following reaction scheme wherein L\n3\n is as specified above and L\n4\n is a group -O-PG\n2\n, a group\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment L\n4\n in (15a) is a group -OPG\n2\n, the PG\n2\n group may be removed and the resulting acid coupled with cyclopropyl amino acids (12a) or (12b), yielding intermediates (12d) or (12e) wherein L\n2\n is a radical (d) or (e).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA general procedure for coupling P3 blocks with a P2 block or a with a P2-P1 block wherein the P2 is a cyclopentane or cyclopentene is shown in the following scheme. L\n3\n and L\n4\n are as specified above.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment L\n3\n and L\n4\n taken together may form a lactone bridge as in (14a), and the coupling of a P3 block with a P2 block is as follows:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nBicyclic lactone (14a) is reacted with (5b) in an amide forming reaction to amide (16c) in which the lactone bridge is opened to (16d). The reaction conditions for the amide forming and lactone opening reactions are as described above or hereinafter. Intermediate (16d) in turn can be coupled to a P1 group as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reactions in the above two schemes are conducted using the same procedures as described above for the reactions of (5a), (7a) or (8a) with (5b) and in particular the above reactions wherein L\n4\n is a group (d) or (e) correspond to the reactions of (5a), (7a) or (8a) with (5b), as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe building blocks P1, P1', P2 and P3 used in the preparation of the compounds of formula (I) can be prepared starting from art-known intermediates. A number of such syntheses are described hereafter in more detail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe individual building blocks can first be prepared and subsequently coupled together or alternatively, precursors of the building blocks can be coupled together and modified at a later stage to the desired molecular composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe functionalities in each of the building blocks may be protected to avoid side reactions.\n\n\n \n\n\nSynthesis of P2 building blocks\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe P2 building blocks contain either a pyrrolidine, a cyclopentane, or a cyclopentene moiety substituted with a group -O-R\n8\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nP2 building blocks containing a pyrrolidine moiety can be derived from commercially available hydroxy proline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation of P2 building blocks that contain a cylopentane ring may be performed as shown in the scheme below.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe bicyclic acid (17b) can be prepared, for example, from 3,4-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-cyclopentanone (17a), as described by\n Rosenquist et al. in Acta Chem. Scand. 46 (1992) 1127-1129\n. A first step in this procedure involves the reduction of the keto group with a reducing agent like sodium borohydride in a solvent such as methanol, followed by hydrolysis of the esters and finally ring closure to the bicyclic lactone (17b) using lactone forming procedures, in particular by using acetic anhydride in the presence of a weak base such as pyridine. The carboxylic acid functionality in (17b) can then be protected by introducing an appropriate carboxyl protecting group, such as a group PG\n2\n, which is as specified above, thus providing bicyclic ester (17c). The group PG\n2\n in particular is acid-labile such as a t.butyl group and is introduced e.g. by treatment with isobutene in the presence of a Lewis acid or with di-\ntert\n-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of a base such as a tertiary amine like dimethylaminopyridine or triethylamine in a solvent like dichloromethane. Lactone opening of (17c) using reaction conditions described above, in particular with lithium hydroxide, yields the acid (17d), which can be used further in coupling reactions with P 1 building blocks. The free acid in (17d) may also be protected, preferably with an acid protecting group PG\n2a\n that is selectively cleavable towards PG\n2\n, and the hydroxy function may be converted to a group -OPG\n1\n or to a group -O-R\n8\n. The products obtained upon removal of the group PG\n2\n are intermediates (17g) and (17i) which correspond to intermediates (13a) or (16a) specified above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntermediates with specific stereochemistry may be prepared by resolving the intermediates in the above reaction sequence. For example, (17b) may be resolved following art-known procedures, e.g. by salt form action with an optically active base or by chiral chromatography, and the resulting stereoisomers may be processed further as described above. The OH and COOH groups in (17d) are in cis position. Trans analogs can be prepared by inverting the stereochemistry at the carbon bearing the OH function by using specific reagents in the reactions introducing OPG\n1\n or O-R\n8\n that invert the stereochemistry, such as, e.g. by applying a Mitsunobu reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the intermediates (17d) are coupled to P1 blocks (12b) or (12c), which coupling reactions correspond to the coupling of (13a) or (16a) with the same P1 blocks, using the same conditions. Subsequent introduction of a -O-R\n8\n-substituent as described above followed by removal of the acid protection group PG\n2\n yields intermediates (8a-1), which are a subclass of the intermediates (7a), or part of the intermediates (16a). The reaction products of the PG\n2\n removal can be further coupled to a P3 building block. In one embodiment PG\n2\n in (17d) is t.butyl which can be removed under acidic conditions, e.g. with trifluoroacetic acid.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn unsaturated P2 building block, i.e. a cyclopentene ring, may be prepared as illustrated in the scheme below.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nA bromination-elimination reaction of 3,4-bis(methoxycarbonyl)cyclopentanone (17a) as described by\n Dolby et al. in J. Org. Chem. 36 (1971) 1277-1285\n followed by reduction of the keto functionality with a reducting agent like sodium borohydride provides the cyclopentenol (19a). Selective ester hydrolysis using for example lithium hydroxide in a solvent like a mixture of dioxane and water, provides the hydroxy substituted monoester cyclopentenol (19b).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn unsaturated P2 building block wherein R\n2\n can also be other than hydrogen, may be prepared as shown in the scheme below.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nOxidation of commercially available 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol (20a), in particular by an oxidizing agent like pyridinium chlorochromate, yields (20b), which is converted to the corresponding methyl ester, e.g. by treatment with acetyl chloride in methanol, followed by a bromination reaction with bromine yielding the α-bromo ester (20c). The latter can then be condensed with the alkenyl ester (20e), obtained from (20d) by an ester forming reaction. The ester in (20e) preferably is a t.butyl ester which can be prepared from the corresponding commercially available acid (20d), e.g. by treatment with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of a base like dimethylaminopyridine. Intermediate (20e) is treated with a base such as lithium diisopropyl amide in a solvent like tetrahydrofuran, and reacted with (20c) to give the alkenyl diester (20f). Cyclisation of (20f) by an olefin metathesis reaction, performed as described above, provides cyclopentene derivative (20g). Stereoselective epoxidation of (20g) can be carried out using the Jacobsen asymmetric epoxidation method to obtain epoxide (20h). Finally, an epoxide opening reaction under basic conditions, e.g. by addition of a base, in particular DBN (1,5-diazabicyclo-[4.3.0]non-5-ene), yields the alcohol (20i). Optionally, the double bond in intermediate (20i) can be reduced, for example by catalytic hydrogenation using a catalyst like palladium on carbon, yielding the corresponding cyclopentane compound. The t.butyl ester may be removed to the corresponding acid, which subsequently is coupled to a P1 building block.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe -O-R\n8\n group can be introduced on the pyrrolidine, cyclopentane or cyclopentene rings at any convenient stage of the synthesis of the compounds according to the present invention. One approach is to first introduce the -O-R\n8\n group to the said rings and subsequently add the other desired building blocks, i.e. P1 (optionally with the P1' tail) and P3, followed by the macrocycle formation. Another approach is to couple the building blocks P2, bearing no -O-R\n8\n substituent, with each P1 and P3, and to add the -O-R\n8\n group either before or after the macrocycle formation. In the latter procedure, the P2 moieties have a hydroxy group, which may be protected by a hydroxy protecting group PG\n1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n8\n groups can be introduced on building blocks P2 by reacting hydroxy substituted intermediates (21a) or (21b) with intermediates (4b) similar as described above for the synthesis of (I) starting from (4a). These reactions are represented in the schemes below, wherein L\n2\n is as specified above and L\n5\n and L\n5a\n independently from one another, represent hydroxy, a carboxyl protecting group -OPG\n2\n or -OPG\n2a\n, or L\n5\n may also represent a P1 group such as a group (d) or (e) as specified above, or L\n5a\n may also represent a P3 group such as a group (b) as specified above The groups PG\n2\n and PG\n2a\n are as specified above. Where the groups L\n5\n and L\n5a\n are PG\n2\n or PG\n2a\n, they are chosen such that each group is selectively cleavable towards the other. For example, one of L\n5\n and L\n5a\n may be a methyl or ethyl group and the other a benzyl or t.butyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment in (21a), L\n2\n is PG and L\n5\n is -OPG\n2\n, or in (21d), L\n5a\n is -OPG\n2\n and L\n5\n is -OPG\n2\n and the PG\n2\n groups are removed as described above.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the group L\n2\n is BOC, L\n5\n is hydroxy and the starting material (21a) is commercially available BOC-hydroxyproline, or any other stereoisomeric form thereof, e.g. BOC-L-hydroxyproline, in particular the trans isomer of the latter. Where L\n5\n in (21b) is a carboxyl-protecting group, it may be removed following procedures described above to (21c). In still another embodiment PG in (21b-1) is Boc and PG\n2\n is a lower alkyl ester, in particular a methyl or ethyl ester. Hydrolysis of the latter ester to the acid can be done by standard procedures, e.g. acid hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid in methanol or with an alkali metal hydroxide such as NaOH, in particular with LiOH. In another embodiment, hydroxy substituted cyclopentane or cyclopentene analogs (2 1 d) are converted to (2 1 e), which, where L\n5\n and L\n5a\n are -OPG\n2\n or -OPG\n2a\n, may be converted to the corresponding acids (21f) by removal of the group PG\n2\n. Removal of PG\n2a\n in (21e-1) leads to similar intermediates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntermediates (4b), which are aniline derivatives, can be prepared using art-known procedures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anilines described herein, either as such or incorporated onto the pyrrolidine, cyclopentane or cyclopentene moieties in the group -OR\n8\n in the compounds of formula (I) or in any of the intermediates mentioned herein, can be further functionalized. Halo groups can be substituted by C\n1-6\nalkoxy or heteroaryl groups. A preferred halo for these reactions is fluoro. Usually this type of aromatic substition reaction is conducted in the presence of a base, e.g. an alkali metal alkyl or alkoxide (e.g. butyl lithium, sodium methoxide or ethoxide) or, in a reaction inert solvent, such as dipolar aprotic solvents (DMA, DMF, DMSO, HMPT and the like), halogenated hydrocarbons (dichloromethane, chlorophorm, dichloroethane) or ethers (THF, dioxan), and in some cases alcohols such as methanol and ethanol. Nitro groups can be reduced to amino groups using standard procedures. Heterocyclyl substituted anilines can also be prepared by building up the heterocycle, for example from anilines or the precursor nitro analogs that are further substituted with an amide or thioamide group. The latter can be converted to a thiazole moiety by condensation with α-bromoketones.\n\n\n \n\n\nSynthesis of P1 building blocks\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cyclopropane amino acid used in the preparation of the P1 fragment is commercially available or can be prepared using art-known procedures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular the amino-vinyl-cyclopropyl ethyl ester (12b) may be obtained according to the procedure described in \n \nWO 00/09543\n \n or as illustrated in the following scheme, wherein PG\n2\n is a carboxyl protecting group as specified above:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nTreatment of commercially available or easily obtainable imine (31a) with 1,4-dihalo-butene in presence of a base produces (31b), which after hydrolysis yields cyclopropyl amino acid (12b), having the allyl substituent syn to the carboxyl group. Resolution of the enantiomeric mixture (12b) results in (12b-1). The resolution is performed using art-known procedures such as enzymatic separation; crystallization with a chiral acid; or chemical derivatization; or by chiral column chromatography. Intermediates (12b) or (12b-1) may be coupled to the appropriate P2 derivatives as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nP1 building blocks for the preparation of compounds according to general formula (I) wherein R\n1\n is -OR\n6\n or -NH-SO\n2\nR\n7\n can be prepared by reacting amino acids (32a) with the appropriate alcohol or amine respectively under standard conditions for ester or amide formation. Cyclopropyl amino acids (32a) are prepared by introducing a N-protecting group PG, and removal of PG\n2\n and the amino acids (32a) are converted to the amides (12c-1) or esters (12c-2), which are subgroups of the intermediates (12c), as outlined in the following reaction scheme, wherein PG is as specified above.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction of (32a) with amine (2b) is an amide forming procedure. The similar reaction with (2c) is an ester forming reaction. Both can be performed following the procedures described above. This reaction yields intermediates (32b) or (32c) from which the amino protecting group is removed by standard methods such as those described above. This in turn results in the desired intermediate (12c-1). Starting materials (32a) may be prepared from the above mentioned intermediates (12b) by first introducing a N-protecting group PG and subsequent removal of the group PG\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the reaction of (32a) with (2b) is done by treatment of the amino acid with a coupling agent, for example N,N'-carbonyl-diimidazole (CDI) or the like, in a solvent like THF followed by reaction with (2b) in the presence of a base such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU). Alternatively the amino acid can be treated with (2b) in the presence of a base like diisopropylethylamine followed by treatment with a coupling agent such as benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (commercially available as PyBOP®) to effect the introduction of the sulfonamide group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntermediates (12c-1) or (12c-2) in turn may be coupled to the appropriate proline, cyclopentane or cyclopentene derivatives as described above.\n\n\n \n\n\nSynthesis of the P3 building blocks\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe P3 building blocks are available commercially or can be prepared according to methodologies known to the skilled in the art. One of these methodologies is shown in the scheme below and uses monoacylated amines, such as trifluoroacetamide or a Boc-protected amine.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above scheme, R together with the CO group forms a N-protecting group, in particular R is t-butoxy, trifluoromethyl; R\n3\n and n are as defined above and LG is a leaving group, in particular halogen, e.g. chloro or bromo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoacylated amines (33a) are treated with a strong base such as sodium hydride and are subsequently reacted with a reagent LG-C\n5-8\nalkenyl (33b), in particular haloC\n5-8\nalkenyl, to form the corresponding protected amines (33c). Deprotection of (33c) affords (5b), which are building blocks P3. Deprotection will depend on the functional group R, thus if R is t-butoxy, deprotection of the corresponding Boc-protected amine can be accomplished with an acidic treatment, e.g. trifluoroacetic acid. Alternatively, when R is for instance trifluoromethyl, removal of the R group is accomplished with a base, e.g. sodium hydroxide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following scheme illustrates yet another method for preparing a P3 building block, namely a Gabriel synthesis of primary C\n5-8\nalkenylamines, which can be carried out by the treatment of a phthalimide (34a) with a base, such as NaOH or KOH, and with (33b), which is as specified above, followed by hydrolysis of the intermediate N-alkenyl imide to generate a primary C\n5-8\nalkenylamine (5b-1).\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the above scheme, n is as defined above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula (I) may be converted into each other following art-known functional group transformation reactions. For example, amino groups may be N-alkylated, nitro groups reduced to amino groups, a halo atom may be exchanged for another halo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) may be converted to the corresponding N-oxide forms following art-known procedures for converting a trivalent nitrogen into its N-oxide form. Said N-oxidation reaction may generally be carried out by reacting the starting material of formula (I) with an appropriate organic or inorganic peroxide. Appropriate inorganic peroxides comprise, for example, hydrogen peroxide, alkali metal or earth alkaline metal peroxides, e.g. sodium peroxide, potassium peroxide; appropriate organic peroxides may comprise peroxy acids such as, for example, benzenecarboperoxoic acid or halo substituted benzenecarboperoxoic acid, e.g. 3-chlorobenzene-carboperoxoic acid, peroxoalkanoic acids, e.g. peroxoacetic acid, alkylhydroperoxides, e.g. tert-butyl hydro-peroxide. Suitable solvents are, for example, water, lower alcohols, e.g. ethanol and the like, hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene, ketones, e.g. 2-butanone, halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, and mixtures of such solvents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPure stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. Diastereomers may be separated by physical methods such as selective crystallization and chromatographic techniques, e.g., counter-current distribution, liquid chromatography and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) may be obtained as racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of formula (I), which are sufficiently basic or acidic may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid, respectively chiral base. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali or acid. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound may be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods may advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the present invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) as specified herein, or a compound of any of the subgroups of compounds of formula (I) as specified herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A therapeutically effective amount in this context is an amount sufficient to prophylactically act against, to stabilize or to reduce viral infection, and in particular HCV viral infection, in infected subjects or subjects being at risk of being infected. In still a further aspect, this invention relates to a process of preparing a pharmaceutical composition as specified herein, which comprises intimately mixing a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier with a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), as specified herein, or of a compound of any of the subgroups of compounds of formula (I) as specified herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, the compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form or metal complex, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also be administered via oral inhalation or insufflation by means of methods and formulations employed in the art for administration via this way. Thus, in general the compounds of the present invention may be administered to the lungs in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry powder, a solution being preferred. Any system developed for the delivery of solutions, suspensions or dry powders via oral inhalation or insufflation are suitable for the administration of the present compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, the present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition adapted for administration by inhalation or insufflation through the mouth comprising a compound of formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably, the compounds of the present invention are administered via inhalation of a solution in nebulized or aerosolized doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, suppositories, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) show antiviral properties. Viral infections and their associated diseases treatable using the compounds and methods of the present invention include those infections brought on by HCV and other pathogenic flaviviruses such as Yellow fever, Dengue fever (types 1-4), St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, Murray valley encephalitis, West Nile virus and Kunjin virus. The diseases associated with HCV include progressive liver fibrosis, inflammation and necrosis leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and HCC; and for the other pathogenic flaviviruses the diseases include yellow fever, dengue fever, hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis. A number of the compounds of this invention moreover are active against mutated strains of HCV. Additionally, many of the compounds of this invention show a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and have attractive properties in terms ofbioavailabilty, including an acceptable half-life, AUC (area under the curve) and peak values and lacking unfavorable phenomena such as insufficient quick onset and tissue retention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nin vitro\n antiviral activity against HCV of the compounds of formula (I) was tested in a cellular HCV replicon system based on\n Lohmann et al. (1999) Science 285:110-113\n, with the further modifications described by \nKrieger et al. (2001) Journal of Virology 75: 4614-4624\n, which is further exemplified in the examples section. This model, while not a complete infection model for HCV, is widely accepted as the most robust and efficient model of autonomous HCV RNA replication currently available. Compounds exhibiting anti-HCV activity in this cellular model are considered as candidates for further development in the treatment of HCV infections in mammals. It will be appreciated that it is important to distinguish between compounds that specifically interfere with HCV functions from those that exert cytotoxic or cytostatic effects in the HCV replicon model, and as a consequence cause a decrease in HCV RNA or linked reporter enzyme concentration. Assays are known in the field for the evaluation of cellular cytotoxicity based for example on the activity of mitochondrial enzymes using fluorogenic redox dyes such as resazurin. Furthermore, cellular counter screens exist for the evaluation of non-selective inhibition of linked reporter gene activity, such as firefly luciferase. Appropriate cell types can be equipped by stable transfection with a luciferase reporter gene whose expression is dependent on a constitutively active gene promoter, and such cells can be used as a counter-screen to eliminate non-selective inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDue to their antiviral properties, particularly their anti-HCV properties, the compounds of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof, their prodrugs, N-oxides, addition salts, quaternary amines, metal complexes and stereochemically isomeric forms, are useful in the treatment of individuals experiencing a viral infection, particularly a HCV infection, and for the prophylaxis of these infections. In general, the compounds of the present invention may be useful in the treatment of warm-blooded animals infected with viruses, in particular flaviviruses such as HCV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may therefore be used as medicines. Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises the systemic administration to viral infected subjects or to subjects susceptible to viral infections of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with the viral infection, in particular the HCV infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to the use of the present compounds or any subgroup thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or the prevention of viral infections, particularly HCV infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure furthermore relates to a method of treating a warm-blooded animal infected by a virus, or being at risk of infection by a virus, in particular by HCV, said method comprising the administration of an anti-virally effective amount of a compound of formula (I), as specified herein, or of a compound of any of the subgroups of compounds of formula (I), as specified herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, the combination of previously known anti-HCV compound, such as, for instance, interferon-α (IFN-α), pegylated interferon-α and/or ribavirin, and a compound of formula (I) can be used as a medicine in a combination therapy. The term \"combination therapy\" relates to a product containing mandatory (a) a compound of formula (I), and (b) optionally another anti-HCV compound, as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in treatment of HCV infections, in particular, in the treatment of infections with HCV.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-HCV compounds encompass agents selected from an HCV polymerase inhibitor, an HCV protease inhibitor, an inhibitor of another target in the HCV life cycle, and immunomodulatory agent, an antiviral agent, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHCV polymerase inhibitors include, but are not limited to, NM283 (valopicitabine), R803, JTK-109, JTK-003, HCV-371, HCV-086, HCV-796 and R-1479.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibitors of HCV proteases (NS2-NS3 inhibitors and NS3-NS4A inhibitors) include, but are not limited to, the compounds of \n \nWO02/18369\n \n (see, e.g., page 273, lines 9-22 and page 274, line 4 to page 276, line 11); BILN-2061, VX-950, GS-9132 (ACH-806), SCH-503034, and SCH-6.

The latter preferably are those HIV inhibitors that have a positive effect on drug metabolism and/or pharmacokinetics that improve bioavailabilty. An example of such an HIV inhibitor is ritonavir.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs such, the present invention further provides a combination comprising (a) an HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and (b) ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound ritonavir, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and methods for its preparation are described in \n \nWO94/14436\n \n. For preferred dosage forms of ritonavir, see \n \nUS6,037, 157\n \n, and the documents cited therein: \n \nUS5,484, 801\n \n, \n \nUS08/402,690\n \n, and \n \nWO95/07696\n \n and \n \nWO95/09614\n \n. Ritonavir has the following formula:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, the combination comprising (a) an HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and (b) ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; further comprises an additional anti-HCV compound selected from the compounds as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a process for preparing a combination as described herein, comprising the step of combining an HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. An alternative embodiment of this invention provides a process wherein the combination comprises one or more additional agent as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combinations of the present invention may be used as medicaments. Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises the systemic administration to HCV-infected subjects of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with HCV and other pathogenic flavi- and pestiviruses. Consequently, the combinations of the present invention can be used in the manufacture of a medicament useful for treating, preventing or combating infection or disease associated with HCV infection in a mammal, in particular for treating conditions associated with HCV and other pathogenic flavi- and pestiviruses.\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a combination according to any one of the embodiments described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.

Bioavailability is defined as the fraction of administered dose reaching systemic circulation. t\n½\n represents the half life or time taken for the plasma concentration to fall to half its original value. C\nss\n is the steady state concentration, i.e. the concentration at which the rate of input of drug equals the rate of elimination. C\nmin\n is defined as the lowest (minimum) concentration measured during the dosing interval. C\nmax\n, represents the highest (maximum) concentration measured during the dosing interval. AUC is defined as the area under the plasma concentration-time curve for a defined period of time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe combinations of this invention can be administered to humans in dosage ranges specific for each component comprised in said combinations. The components comprised in said combinations can be administered together or separately. The NS3/4a protease inhibitors of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof, and ritonavir or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, may have dosage levels of the order of 0.02 to 5.0 grams-per-day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) and ritonavir are administered in combination, the weight ratio of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) \nto\n ritonavir is suitably in the range of from about 40:1 to about 1:15, or from about 30:1 to about 1:15, or from about 15: 1 to about 1: 15, typically from about 10: 1 to about 1:10, and more typically from about 8:1 to about 1:8. Also useful are weight ratios of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors of formula (I) to ritonavir ranging from about 6:1 to about 1:6, or from about 4:1 to about 1:4, or from about 3:1 to about 1:3, or from about 2:1 to about 1:2, or from about 1.5:1 to about 1:1.5. In one aspect, the amount by weight of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors of formula (I) is equal to or greater than that of ritonavir, wherein the weight ratio of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) to ritonavir is suitably in the range of from about 1: 1 to about 15: 1, typically from about 1: 1 to about 10: 1, and more typically from about 1: 1 to about 8: 1. Also useful are weight ratios of the HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitor of formula (I) \nto\n ritonavir ranging from about 1: 1 to about 6: 1, or from about 1: 1 to about 5: 1, or from about 1: 1 to about 4:1, or from about 3:2 to about 3:1, or from about 1:1 to about 2:1 or from about 1:1 to about 1.5:1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term ''therapeutically effective amount\" as used herein means that amount of active compound or component or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought, in the light of the present invention, by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the instant invention refers to combinations comprising two or more agents, the \"therapeutically effective amount\" is that amount of the agents taken together so that the combined effect elicits the desired biological or medicinal response. For example, the therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising (a) the compound of formula (I) and (b) ritonavir, would be the amount of the compound of formula (I) and the amount of ritonavir that when taken together have a combined effect that is therapeutically effective.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general it is contemplated that an antiviral effective daily amount would be from 0.01 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg body weight, more preferably from 0.1 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as one, two, three, four or more (sub-)doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said (sub-)doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing 1 to 1000 mg, and in particular 5 to 200 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe exact dosage and frequency of administration depends on the particular compound of formula (I) used, the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight, sex, extent of disorder and general physical condition of the particular patient as well as other medication the individual may be taking, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore, it is evident that said effective daily amount may be lowered or increased depending on the response of the treated subject and/or depending on the evaluation of the physician prescribing the compounds of the instant invention.

The organic layer was washed with saturated NaHCO\n3\n (3 x 200 ml) and brine (1 x 150 ml), then dried with sodium sulfite, filtered and the residue was evaporated to an oily residue. Upon addition of hexane to the residue, the product precipitated. Addition of more hexane and heating to reflux gave a clear solution from which the product crystallized. The crystals were collected by filtration and were washed with hexane (rt), then air-dried for 72 h giving colourless needles (12.45 g, 58.7 mmol, 66%).\n\n\n \n \nExample 98:\n Activity of compounds of formula (I)\n\n\nReplicon assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) were examined for activity in the inhibition of HCV RNA replication in a cellular assay. The assay demonstrated that the compounds of formula (I) exhibited activity against HCV replicons functional in a cell culture. The cellular assay was based on a bicistronic expression construct, as described by \nLohmann et al. (1999) Science vol. 285 pp. 110-113\n with modifications described by \nKrieger et al. (2001) Journal of Virology 75: 4614-4624\n, in a multi-target screening strategy. In essence, the method was as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay utilized the stably transfected cell line Huh-7 luc/neo (hereafter referred to as Huh-Luc). This cell line harbors an RNA encoding a bicistronic expression construct comprising the wild type NS3-NS5B regions of HCV type 1b translated from an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), preceded by a reporter portion (FfL-luciferase), and a selectable marker portion (neo\nR\n, neomycine phosphotransferase). The construct is bordered by 5' and 3' NTRs (non-translated regions) from HCV type 1b. Continued culture of the replicon cells in the presence of G418 (neo\nR\n) is dependent on the replication of the HCV RNA. The stably transfected replicon cells that express HCV RNA, which replicates autonomously and to high levels, encoding \ninter alia\n luciferase, are used for screening the antiviral compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe replicon cells were plated in 384 well plates in the presence of the test and control compounds which were added in various concentrations. Following an incubation of three days, HCV replication was measured by assaying luciferase activity (using standard luciferase assay substrates and reagents and a Perkin Elmer ViewLux\nTm\n ultraHTS microplate imager). Replicon cells in the control cultures have high luciferase expression in the absence of any inhibitor. The inhibitory activity of the compound on luciferase activity was monitored on the Huh-Luc cells, enabling a dose-response curve for each test compound. EC50 values were then calculated, which value represents the amount of the compound required to decrease by 50% the level of detected luciferase activity, or more specifically, the ability of the genetically linked HCV replicon RNA to replicate.\n\n\n \nInhibition assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe aim of this \nin vitro\n assay was to measure the inhibition of HCV NS3/4A protease complexes by the compounds of the present invention. This assay provides an indication of how effective compounds of the present invention would be in inhibiting HCV NS3/4A proteolytic activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibition of full-length hepatitis C NS3 protease enzyme was measured essentially as described in Poliakov, 2002 Prot Expression & Purification 25 363 371. Briefly, the hydrolysis of a depsipeptide substrate, Ac-DED(Edans)EEAbuψ[COO]ASK(Dabcyl)-NH\n2\n (AnaSpec, San José, USA), was measured spectrofluorometrically in the presence of a peptide cofactor, KKGSVVIVGRIVLSGK (Åke Engström, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, Sweden). [Landro, 1997 #Biochem 36 9340-9348]. The enzyme (1 nM) was incubated in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mM DTT, 40% glycerol, 0.1 % n-octyl-D-glucoside, with 25 µM NS4A cofactor and inhibitor at 30°C for 10 min, whereupon the reaction was initiated by addition of 0.5 µM substrate. Inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO, sonicated for 30 sec. and vortexed. The solutions were stored at - 20°C between measurements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe final concentration of DMSO in the assay sample was adjusted to 3.3%. The rate of hydrolysis was corrected for inner filter effects according to published procedures [\nLiu, Analytical Biochemistry, 1999, vol. 267, pp. 331-335\n]. Ki values were estimated by non-linear regression analysis (GraFit, Erithacus Software, Staines, MX, UK), using a model for competitive inhibition and a fixed value for Km (0.15 µM). A minimum of two replicates was performed for all measurements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following Table 1 and Table 2 lists compounds that were prepared according to any one of the above examples.
