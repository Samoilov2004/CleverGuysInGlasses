Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel pharmacologically active benzimidazolone derivatives and their addicton salts which bind the serotonine and dopamine receptors, to their preparation and their use for therapeutic purposes. These compounds, owing to their pharmacological activity, are useful in the treatment of CNS disorders.\n\n\n \n\n\nBackground of the invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSerotonine (5-HT) recognises several well defined cell surface receptors. Among these, 5-HT\n1A\n and 5-HT\n2A\n at which serotonine have high affinity, are known to be implicated in many Central Nervous System disorders such as sexual disorders, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, Parkinson and neurodegenerative diseases (\n \nEP 0 526 434 B1\n \n; \n \nWO 01/21593 A1\n \n; \n \nWO 02/24661 A2\n \n; \n \nWO 02/24662 A1\n \n; \n \nWO 03/014079 A1\n \n; \n \nWO 03/013539 A1\n \n; \n \nWO 03/035072 A1\n \n; \n \nWO 05/102343 A1\n \n; \n \nWO 06/019715 A1\n \n; \n \nWO 06/010574 A1\n \n; \n \nWO 06/024471 A1\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the previous art, several classes of compounds able to interfere with the neurotransmission at serotonine or dopamine receptor subtypes are known. Particularly, derivatives based on the core structure of the arylpiperazine and benzimidazolone have been described (e.g. \n \nGB 2023594\n \n, \n \nU.S. Pat. 3,472,854\n \n, \n \nU.S. Pat. 4,954,503\n \n and \n \nWO 98/33784\n \n), and targeted both to generic serotonine or dopamine receptors and to a specific receptor subtype. In another patent (\n \nUS 5,576,318\n \n) compounds based both on the benzimidazolone and phenyl piperazine structures are described: in this latter case the described amenities are limited to 5-HT\n1A\n and 5-HT\n2A\n receptor subtypes. Further compounds with affinity to 5-HT recptors and their synthesis have been disclosed in \n \nWO 01/21593 A1\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\nDetailed description of the invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHere we describe, and this is one object of the present invention, new sulfate esters based on the benzimidazolone phenyl piperazine structure. Surprisingly it was discovered that the compounds according to this invention possess an interesting affinity profile at the said serotonine receptor subtypes: indeed, some of them have a high and preferential affinity at a given site (e.g. 5-HT\n1A\n or 5-HT\n2A\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOwing to their peculiar profile, the present compounds may play a role in the regulation of neurotransmission at the serotonine sites and thus may be of value in the treatment of those diseases where an altered functioning of neurosignal transmission is present. Examples of these CNS disorders include depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson, anxiety, sleep disturbances, sexual and mental disorders and age associated memory impairment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the present invention, we provide compounds of general formula (I)\n\n \n \n\nwherein\n\nR\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, and R\n4\n denote hydrogen or sulfate monoester with the proviso that R\n1\n, R\n2\n,\n\nR\n3\n, and R\n4\n cannot simultaneously represent hydrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred compounds according to the invention are those of general formula (I) wherein two or three of the four radicals R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, and R\n4\n denote hydrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso preferred are compounds of general formula (I) wherein one of the radicals R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, and R\n4\n denotes sulfate, whilst the other radicals represent hydrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf particular interest are compounds selected from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n \n \n(I.a)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(I.b)\n \n \n \n(I.c)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(I.d)\n \n \n \n(I.e)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(I.f)\n \n \n \n(I.g)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(I.h)\n \n \n \n(I.i)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(I.j)\n \n \n \n(I.k)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(I.l)\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is understood that the compounds represented by formula (I) may exist also as the corresponding zwitter ion form and that while both forms are included within the meaning of the structural formula, for simplicity sake, only the free acid form is shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the pharmaceutical use the compounds of general formula (I) may be used also in the form of pharmacologically acceptable salts. As used herein, \" acceptable salts\" refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic base salts of acidic residues such as sulfuric acid monoester and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, gluconic, isethionic, glycinic, mucoic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isothionic, and the like. Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non-toxic salts and examples are the lithium, sodium, potassium, aluminium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, ethylamine, diethylamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine, choline, arginine, glycine, procaine, tromethamine, benzathine, lysine and meglumine salts (also see Pharmaceutical salts, \nBerge, S.M. et al., J. Pharm. Sci., (1977), 66, 1-19\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacologically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase \"pharmacologically acceptable\" is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the light of the pharmaceutical efficacy of the compounds of formula (I), the present invention furthermore relates to the use of those compounds as a medicament.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further aspect of the present invention relates to the use of compounds of formula (I), optionally in form of the pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof for preparing a pharmaceutical composition for treating diseases in which the use of compounds displaying affinity for the 5-HT\n1A\n and 5-HT\n2\n-receptor may have a therapeutic benefit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to the use of the one or more compounds of formula (I) selected from the group consisting of compound (I.a), (I.b), (I.c), (I.d), (I.e), (I.f), (I.g), (I.h), (I.i), (I.j), (I.k) and (I.l), most preferably the use of the compound of formula (I.b), optionally in form of the pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof for the preparation of a medicament for treating diseases in which the use of compounds displaying affinity for the 5-HT\n1A\n and 5-HT\n2\n-receptor may have a therapeutic benefit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment the present invention relates to the use of one or more of the compounds of formula (I), more preferably to the use of one or more compounds of formula (I.a), (l.b), (I.c), (I.d), (I.e), (I.f), (I.g), (l.h), (I.i), (I.j), (I.k) and (I.l), most preferably the use of the compound of formula (I.b), optionally in form of the pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of sexual disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe generic term \"Sexual disorders\" includes Sexual Desire Disorders (i.e. Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, Sexual Aversion Disorder), Sexual Arousal Disorders (i.e. Female Sexual Arousal Disorder, Male Erectile Disorder), Orgasmic Disorders (i.e. Female Orgasmic Disorder, Male Orgasmic Disorder, Premature Ejaculation) Sexual Pain Disorders (i.e. Dyspareunia, Vaginismus), Sexual Dysfunction due to a General Medical Condition, Substance-Induced Sexual Dysfunction, and Sexual Dysfunction not otherwise specified (\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision.

The tablets may also comprise several layers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCoated tablets may be prepared accordingly by coating cores produced analogously to the tablets with substances normally used for tablet coatings, for example collidone or shellac, gum arabic, talc, titanium dioxide or sugar. To achieve delayed release or prevent incompatibilities the core may also consist of a number of layers. Similarly the tablet coating may consist of a number or layers to achieve delayed release, possibly using the excipients mentioned above for the tablets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSyrups or elixirs containing the active substances or combinations thereof according to the invention may additionally contain a sweetener such as saccharine, cyclamate, glycerol or sugar and a flavour enhancer, e.g. a flavouring such as vanilline or orange extract. They may also contain suspension adjuvants or thickeners such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, wetting agents such as, for example, condensation products of fatty alcohols with ethylene oxide, or preservatives such as p-hydroxybenzoates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolutions for injection are prepared in the usual way, e.g. with the addition of preservatives such as p-hydroxybenzoates, or stabilisers such as alkali metal salts of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, and transferred into injection vials or ampoules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCapsules containing one or more active substances or combinations of active substances may for example be prepared by mixing the active substances with inert carriers such as lactose or sorbitol and packing them into gelatine capsules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable suppositories may be made for example by mixing with carriers provided for this purpose, such as neutral fats or polyethyleneglycol or the derivatives thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of general formula (I) can be conveniently prepared by a variety of synthetic routes known to those skilled in the art. According to a further object of the present invention, processes for the preparation of compounds of general formula (I) are provided, in which:\n\n\n \na) a compound of general formula (II)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n and R\n4\n denote hydroxy or hydrogen and at least one among R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n and R\n4\n is hydroxy, is reacted with a sulfation reagent such as sulfuric acid, sulfur trioxide, sulfur trioxide in the presence of organic bases or amides or tetrabutyl ammonium hydrogensulfate in combination with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The synthesis of the compounds according to formula (II) has been described in \n \nWO 01/21593 A1\n \n, page 7 line 17 to page 14, line 34.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred reagents are sulfur trioxide in the presence of tertiary amines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine or pyridine, or sulfur trioxide in the presence of dimethylformamide and combinations thereof. Particularly preferred reagent is sulfur trioxide complexed with dimethylformamide in the presence of pyridine.\n\nThe reaction can be conveniently carried out at temperature ranging from 10 to 50°C under stirring, preferably between 20 and 50°C, most preferably at 40°C, or\n\n\n \nb) a compound of general formula (III)\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n and R\n4\n denote protected sulfate monoester or hydrogen and at least one among R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n and R\n4\n is a protected sulfate monoester, is reacted with a cleavage reagent to restore the free acid moiety (see: \nGunnarson GT et al. Biorganic and Medicinal Chemistry, 13 (2005) 1783-1789\n; \nSimpson LS, Journal of the American Chemical Society 128 (2006) 1605-1610\n). Protecting groups for sulfates are represented by alkyl and halogenated alkyls, preferably isobutyl, neopentyl and 2,2,2-trichloroethyl. In case the protecting group is alkyl, the protected sulfates can be cleaved with nucleophiles in polar aprotic solvents. Examples of nucleophiles are azide, cyanide, iodide and thiocianate; as solvents dimethylformamide and acetone can be conveniently used. The reaction can be conveniently carried out in warm solvents, preferably between 50 and 70°C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtected sulfates of general formula (III) can be conveniently prepared by reacting a compound of general formula (II), wherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n and R\n4\n denote hydroxy or hydrogen and at least one among R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n and R\n4\n is hydroxy, with suitable alkylchlorosulfates or halogenated alkylchlorosulfates in the presence of a base in an aprotic solvent. Examples of alkylchorosulfates are isobutylchlorosulfate and neopentylchlorosulfate, example of halogenated alkylchlorosulfate is 2,2,2-trichloroethyl chorosulfate. As bases, organic or inorganic bases can be used: non limitative examples are: dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine, DBU, sodium hydride, sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, etc. As solvent, tetrahydrofurane can be conveniently used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized by enzymatic processes using S9 fractions from human or animal livers as the source of sulfotransferases and adenosine-3'-phosphate-5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS) as the sulphate donor (\nFoldes A, Meek JL, Biochem. Biophys. Acta 327:365-374, 1973\n; \nHonma W et al., drug Metabolism and Disposition 30: 944-949, 2002\n; \nWang Q et al. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol.-Animal 41: 97-103, 2005\n). A typical incubation mixture consists of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 10 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM PAPS, human or animal (rat, dog, monkey) liver S9 fraction (commercially available) adjusted to a final protein concentration of 1 mg/mL and of 10 - 100 µM of a compound of general formula (II) as the substrate. The reaction is initiated by the addition of PAPS and terminated by the addition of 4 times the volume of ice-cold acetonitrile after incubation at 37°C for 2 to 8 hours depending on the substrate molecule. The mixture is centrifuged to sediment the precipitated protein. The supernatant containing the compound sulphate is concentrated under a stream of nitrogen, re-suspended in water and purified by liquid chromatography using a C18 separating column (100x4.6 mm ID, ProC18, YMC, Schermbeck, Germany) protected by a guard column (15x4 mm ID, Purosphere E, C18, Merck, Germany) and a flow rate of 1 mL/min. A linear gradient (mobile phase A: 0.1 % HCOOH and 10 % ACN in water, mobile phase B: 0.1 % HCOOH and 75 % ACN in water) where ACN concentration increases from 10 to 75 % within 25 minutes can be used to separate the sulphate from impurities. The identity of the purified sulphate can be verified by HPLC (mobile phase: 0.1 % ammonium formiate, pH 3.3 and 70 % acetonitrile in water, 0.3 mUmin flow rate) interfaced to an electrospray (positive) ionization tandem mass spectrometry (API 365, Perkin-Elmer-Sciex, Canada) using a pneumatically assisted electrospray ionisation source. The structure is verified by fragmentation of the [M+H]+ ion (m/z 583). The consecutive loss of 2 SO3 moieties (-80 amu, respectively) leads to the key fragment C (m/z 423). At higher collision energies fragment m/z 177 (hydroxylated benzimidazolone sturucture) is also observed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned before, the compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention, surprisingly show interesting pharmacological properties owing to their different profile at the serotonine or dopamine receptor subtypes, such as 5-HT\n1A\n and 5-HT\n2A\n. The biochemical profile of the compounds was assessed by evaluating their affinity for the 5-HT\n1A\n and 5-HT\n2A\n receptors, according to the methods described below.\n\n\n \n\n\nReceptor Binding studies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nBinding studies can be carried out to determine the affinity of the compounds for 5-HT\n1A\n and 5-HT\n2A\n receptors\n\n\n \n\n\n5-HT\n\n\n\n\n1A\n\n\n\n\nreceptor\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman recombinant CHO-K1 cells are used.

It should be understood that the invention is not limited to the given examples of chemical methods and processes for the preparation of the substances, as other conventional methods well known to those skilled in the art, are suitable too.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{2-oxo-3-{2-[4-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-ethyl}-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl}\nmono\n sulfuric acid ester\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n6-Hydroxy-1-{2-[4-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1,3-dihydro-benzimidazol-2-one (2.0g; 4.9 mmol) is dissolved in pyridine (10 ml) in a round bottom flask under stirring. Sulfur trioxide dimethylformamide complex (3.8 g, 24.2 mmol) dissolved in pyridine (4 ml) is added at room temperature; then the mixture is warmed to 40°C until a suspension is formed\n\nThe reaction mixture is evaporated under vacuum to remove most of the liquid. The almost solid residue is taken up in 1:1 mixture of ethylether and ethylacetate, then triturated and filtered through fritted glass. The residual solid is repeatedly washed with water and finally with ethyl ether. Upon drying, the title compound is obtained as solid, 1.48g;\n\nm.p. 262-264 °C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe other sulfates can be prepared by the outlined procedure from the corresponding hydroxy derivatives described in \n \nWO 01/21593 A1\n \n on page 2 line 13 to 29.

The mixture is evaporated to dryness under vacuum and the residue is taken up with water and ethylacetate. The organic phase is separated and washed twice with water. After drying over magnesium sulfate, evaporation of the solvent leaves a residue which is triturated with ethylether.\n\n\n \nii) 2-Amino-4-methoxy-N-{2-[4-(4-methoxy-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)piperazin-1-yl]-ethyl}-aniline\n\n\n \n \n \nN-(4-Methoxy-2-nitro-phenyl)-2-[4-(4-methoxy-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]acetamide (6.1g; 11 mmol) iss dissolved in 70 ml tetrahydrofurane. Borane-tetrahydrofurane complex (90 ml of 1M THF solution) is added at 10°C and the mixture is warmed to 55°C for 4 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent is evaporated under vacuum and the residue is taken with ethanol and acidified with hydrochloric acid. Heating to 50 °C takes place for 60 min. Upon overnight cooling, the unreacted compound is separated by filtration. The liquid phase is dried under vacuum, taken up with water and, after removal of the undissolved solid, saturated sodium hydrogencarbonate solution is added. The aqueous phase is extracted with ethylacetate and the organic layer is dessicated prior to evaporation. The residue is purified by silicagel chromatography (methylene chloride/methanol/32% aqueous ammonia 95:5:0.5).

The mixture is left at room temperature under stirring for 24h. After evaporation to dryness, the residue is purified by silicagel chromatography (methylene chloride/methanol/32% aqueous ammonia 95:5:0.5). The crude title compound is triturated with ethylether.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1-{2-[4-(2-Methoxy-5-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-ethtl}-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazol-2-one\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n1-(2-methoxy-5-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazine hydrochloride (1.2g; 4.0 mmol) and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-1,3-dihydro-benzimidazo)-2-one (0.81g; 4.2 mmol) are dissolved in 10 ml dimethylformamide in the presence of 0.56g potassium carbonate. The mixture is heated to 100 °C for 8 hours. After cooling, it is partitioned between 50 ml water and 30 ml ethylacetate; the aqueous phase is extracyed once more with ethylacetate. The organic layer is washed with 5% hydrochloric acid and with water. The organic layer is dried and evaporated under vacuum. The residue is triturated with ethylacetate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe deprotection of the hydroxy groups of the compounds described in Example 2) and 3) can easily carried out by conventional known procedures e.g. as described in \n \nWO 01/21593 A1\n \n. For example, the deprotection can be achieved by treatment with strong aqueous acids such as 48% hydrobromic acid at high temperatures or alternatively by treatment with boron derivatives such as BBr\n3\n, at low temperatures in chlorurated solvents such as methylene chloride. The resulting deprotected hydroxy-derivatives can be easily converted to the corresponding disulfate ester as described in Example 1.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExamples of pharmaceutical formulations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA)\n\n\nTablets\n\n\nper tablet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncompound (I.a)\n\n\n100 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nlactose\n\n\n240 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ncorn starch\n\n\n340 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\npolyvinylpyrrolidone\n\n\n45 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmagnesium stearate\n\n\n15 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n740 mg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe finely ground active substance, lactose and some of the corn starch are mixed together.
