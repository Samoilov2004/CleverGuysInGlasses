invention relates to a novel kind of dihydroindene amide compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, their preparation methods, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds, the methods for their use in the prevention or treatment of the diseases associated with the abnormal activities of protein kinases, especially for the diseases associated with the abnormal activities of Abl, Bcr-Abl, c-Kit and PDGFR, and their use for manufacturing of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of the said diseases.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein kinases are the enzymes which transfer a phosphate group from a nucleoside triphosphate to certain serine, threonine or tyrosine residues. Protein phosphorylation causes the activation of signal transduction pathways, which play crucial roles in various biological processes, including cell growth, metabolism, differentiation and death. It is known that abnormal signals caused by abnormal or improper activities of protein kinases, are related to a number of diseases, including cancer, inflammation, autoimmune disease, metabolic disease, infection, central nervous system disease, cardiovascular disease and so on. Thus, protein kinases are attractive targets for drug development (\nCohen, Not Rev. Drug Discovery 2002,1,309\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nabl\n gene and the \nbcr\n gene are normal genes located on chromosome 9 and 22, respectively. Two fusion genes are created by the reciprocal translocation between these two genes: the \nbcr-obl\n gene located on chromosome 22q- and the abl-bcr gene located on chromosome 9q+, The protein of 210kD (p210Bcr-Abl) is encoded by the \nbcr-abl\n gene on the Philadelphia chromosome. The Abl part of the Bcr-Abl protein comprising the Abl tyrosine kinases is strictly regulated in the prototype c-Abl but continuously activated in the Bcr-Abl fusion protein, which results in cell growth disorder. The Bcr-Abi protein can be found in 95% of the patients with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) and in 10-25% of the patients with Acute Lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Imatinib, brand-named as Gleevec, is a Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor and has been clinically prove to be an effective formulation for the treatment of CML. (\nDruker et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006, 355, 2408\n). However, despite continuous treatment using Imatinib, some patients with CMLs are recurrent at the terminal phase or the blast crisis phase due to drug resistance. The molecular basis of drug resistance is that imatinib-resistant mutants arise in the kinase domain of the Bcr-Abl protein. To date, more than 22 mutants have been reported and the most common ones are M244V, G250E, Q252H, Y253H, E255K, E255V, P311L, T351l, F317L, F359V, V3791, L387M, H396P, H396R and etc. (\nNardi, et al. Curr, Opin, Hemotol. 2004, 11, 35\n),\n\n\n \n \n \n \nc-Kit (CD117, stem cell factor receptor), encoded by the c-kit proto-oncogene, is a kind of growth factor receptor with tyrosine kinase activity. It can be activated upon binding to stem cell factor (SCF). Mutations in c-kit result in continuous activation of the function of c-Kit tyrosine kinase, which further causes the activity of tyrosine kinase independent on ligands, the autophosphorylation of c-Kit, and the deregulation of cell proliferation. Overexpression and mutations of c-Kit are found in most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are a series of mesenchymal tumors which arise from the precursors of gastrointestinal tract tissue cells. They mainly occur in the middle-aged and the old population, About 70% of the tumors occur in the stomach, 20-30% of the tumors occur in the small intestine and less than 10% of the tumors: occur in the esophagus, colon and rectum. As known to all, gastrointestinal stromal tumors are resistant to classical chemotherapy but can be treated effectively by inhibiting c-Kit using Imatinib, which suggests that c-Kit plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of these diseases (\nJoensuu et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001, 344, 1052\n). c-Kit is overexpose and mutates in other various human cancers as well, including mast cell tumor, neuroblastoma, germ cell tumor, melanoma, small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, oophoroma and acute myeloid leukaemia (see \nEdling et al. Int J. Biochem, Cell Biol. 2007, 39, 1995\n; \nLennartsson et al. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets, 2006, 6, 65\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the role in cancers, SCF/c-Kit also related to autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. SCF is expressed by various structural and inflammatory cells in the breathing passage, A number of pathways are activated by the combination of SCF and c-Kit, including the pathways involving Phosphoinositide-3 (PI3) kinase, phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma, Src protein kinase, Janus kinase (JAK) / signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Suppression of the SCF / c-Kit pathway can dramatically lower the level of histamine, reduce the penetration of mast cells and eosinophilic granulocytes, and decrease the release of interleukin (IL)-4 and the over-reactivity of the breathing passages. SCF/c-Kit is therefore a potential treatment target, which can control the number of mast cells and eosinophilic granulocytes, and can control the activation of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, including scytitis, rheumatoid arthritis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and Crohn disease (see \nReber et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2006, 533, 327\n; \nPaniagua et al. Nat. Clin. Prac. Rheum. 2007, 3, 190\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlatelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR), such as PDGFR-α and PDGFR-β, are transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors, whose ligands are formed by two A chains (PDGF-A), or two B chains (PDGF-B), or a heterodimer of one A chain and one B chain (PDGF-AB), Platelet-derived growth factor receptors are dimerized upon ligands binding, followed by activation of its tyrosine kinase and signaling to downstream, In vivo animal studies on PDGFs and PDGFRs reveal that PDGFR-α signaling plays a role in the development of gastrulation, cranial and cardiac neutral crest, gonad, lung, intestine, skin, central nervous system and bone, Similarly, the role of PDGFR-β signaling in angiogenesis and early hematopoiesis has been revealed as well. Plate let-derived growth factor signaling is associated with a number of diseases. Autocrine activation of growth factor signaling pathway relates to some gliomatosis cerebri, myeloproliferative disease, tumor, multiple myeloma, and sarcoma including dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. Paracrine growth factor signaling is usually found in epithelial cancer,. It initiates the inhalation of matrix therein, and may participate in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and thus affect tumor's development, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. Platelet-derived growth factors drive organic pathological changes of vascular disease, such as atheromatosis, arteriostenosis, pulmonary hypertension, retinal disease, and hepatofibrosis including pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, hepatocirrhosis, scleriasis, glomerulosclerosis and myocardial fibrosis (see \nAndrae et al Gene Dev. 2008, 22,1276\n). Therefore, the suppression of PDGFR can prevent and treat the above-mentioned diseases, Additionally, the suppression of PDGFR can also treat a variety of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases including diabetes, particularly Type-1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn disease and etc. (\nPaniagua et al. Nat Clin, Prac Rheum. 2007. 3,190\n; \nLouvet et al. Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. USA, 2008, 105, 18895\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention provides a novel kind of dihydroindene amide derivatives, which can inhibit the activity of protein kinases, especially one or more protein kinases described above. These compounds will therefore be useful to prevent or treat the diseases associated with the abnormality or disorder in the activity of protein kinases, especially the diseases associated with abnormality in the activity of Abl, Bcr-Abl, c-Kit and PDGFR protein kinases,\n\n\n \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides the compounds of Formula I:\n\n \n \n\nor pharmaceutical acceptable salts or prodrug thereof, wherein:\n\n \n \n \nR\n1\n is a saturated cyclic amino-group; which can be optionally substituted by 1, 2, 3 or 4 R\n1a\n;\n \nR\n1a\n is H, halogen, cyano-group, C\n1-6\n alkyl, C\n1-6\n hydroxyalkyl, C\n1-6\n haloalkyl, C\n1-6\n cy3noalkyl, OR\na\n, SR\na\n, NR\nb\nR\nc\n, NR\nb\nC(O)R\nd\n, NR\nb\nS(O)\n2\nR\nc\n, C(O)NR\nb\nR\nc\n, C(O)R\nd\n, C(O)OR\na\n, S(O)\n2\nR\nd\n, C\n2-6\n alkenyl, C\n2-6\n alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, or heterocycloalkyl, wherein the said C\n1-6\n alkyl, C\n2-6\n alkenyl, C\n2-6\n alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl can be optionally substituted by 1, 2 or 3 groups independently selected from cyane-group, halogen, OR\na\n, SR\na\n, NR\nb\nR\nc\n, NR\nb\n(CO)R\nd\n, NR\nb\nS(O)\n2\nR\nd\n, C(O)NR\nb\nR\nc\n, S(O)\n2\nNR\nb\nR\nc\n, C(O)R\nd\n, C(O)OR\na\n, S(O)\n2\nR\nd\n, C\n1-6\nhaloalkyl, C\n1-6\n hydroxyalkyl, C\nx-ii\n cyanoalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, and heterocycloalkyl; Alternatively, two R\n1a\n groups taken together with the atoms attached to them can form a cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl of 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7-membered ring, and can be optionally substituted by 1, 2 or 3 groups independently selected from cyano-group, halogen, OR\na\n, SR\na\n, NR\nb\nR\nc\n, NR\nb\n(CO)R\nc\n, NR\nb\nS(O)\n2\nR\nd\n, C(O)NR\nb\nR\nc\n, S(O)\n2\nNR\nb\nR\nc\n, C(O)R\nd\n, C(O)OR\na\n, S(O)\n2\nR\nd\n, C\n1-6\n haloalkyl, C\n1-6\n hydroxyalkyl, C\n1-6\n cyanoalkyl, C\n2-6\n alkenyl, C\n2-6\n alkynyl; aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, and heterocycloalkyl;\n \nR\n2\n is H, halogen, cyano-group, OR\na\n, SR\na\n, NR\nb\nR\nc\n, C\n1-6\n alkyl, C\n1-6\n hydroxyalkyl, C\n1-6\n haloalkyl, C\n1-6\n cyanoalkyl, C\n2-6\n alkenyl, C\n2-6\n alkynyl; Alternatively, two R\n2\n groups taken together with the atoms attached to them can form a cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl of 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7-membered ring, and can be optionally substituted by 1, 2 or 3 groups independently selected from cyano-group, halogen, OR\na\n, SR\na\n, NR\nb\nR\nc\n, NR\nb\n(CO)R\nd\n, NR\nb\nS(O)\n2\nR\nd\n, C(O)NR\nb\nR\nc\n, S(O)\n2\nNR\nb\nR\nc\n, C(O)R\nd\n C(O)OR\na\n, S(O)\n2\nR\nb\n, C\n1-6\n haloalkyl, C\n1-6\n hydroxyalkyl, C\n1-6\n cyanoalkyl, C\n2\n-\n6\n alkenyl, and C\n2-6\nalkynyl;\n \nR\n3\n is H, halogen, cyano-group, OR\na\n, SR\na\n, NR\nb\nR\nc\n, C\n1-6\n alkyl, C\n1-6\n hydroxyalkyl, C\n1-6\n haloalkyl, C\n1-6\n cyanoalkyl, C\n2-6\n alkenyl, C\n2-6\n alkynyl, cycloalkyl, or heterocycloalkyl.

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts Include, but are not limited to the inorganic or organic acid salts of basic group such as amidocyanogen. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt herein can be synthesized from its parent compound, i.e. the basic group in the parent compound reacts with 1-4 equivalent of acid in solvent systems, The suitable salts were enumerated in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical sciences, 17th ed, Mark Publishing Company, Easton, Pa, 1985, p. 1418\n and \nJournal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66, 2 (1977\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be prepared from inorganic or organic acids. The acid addition salts can be derived from the inorganic acids including hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric add, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and etc. The acid addition salts can be derived from the organic acids including acetic acid, propionic add, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric add, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnarnic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic add, ethyl sulfonic acid, toluene-p-sulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"pharmaceutically acceptable carriers\" include any and all solvents, dispersive media, coats, anti-bacterial or anti-fungal agents, isotonic agents or absorption retardants and so on. Such media and agents used in pharmaceutically active substances are well known in the art. The uses of them in therapeutic compositions are predictable, unless any common media or agents are incompatible with the active substances. Additional active ingredients can be incorporated into the compositions as well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions herein are preferably prepared in unit dosage form. The term \"unlit dosage form\" refers to physically discrete unit of a single dose which is suitable to be administrated to human or other mammal subjects, As to achieve required effective treatment, based on collocation, each unit contains predetermined quantity of active substances, as well as relevant suitable pharmaceutical excipients (such as tablet, capsule, ampoule). The compounds of Formula I are effective in a broad dose range and are usually administrated in effective amount. Preferably, with regard to oral administration, each dose unit contains 10 mg to 2 g of the compounds of Formula 1, more preferably 10mg to 700 mg; while with regard to parenteral administration, each dose unit contains preferably 10 mg to 700 mg of the compounds of Formula 1, more preferably 50 mg to 200 mg. However, it should be appreciated that the actual administration amount of the compounds of Formula I is determined by physicians based on the relevant condition, including the disease to be treated, the administration route to be selected, the actual compound and its relative activity to be given, as well as the age, body weight, response and the severity of symptoms of the patient, and etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo prepare solid composition such as tablets, the main active components are mixed with the pharmaceutical excipients (or carriers) to form solid pre-prepared composition, wherein the homogeneous mixture of the compounds of the present invention is contained. When these pre-prepared compositions are called as homogeneous mixture, it means that the active components are evenly dispersed in the whole composition, which allows the composition to be easily divided into unit dosage form with the same efficacy, such as tablet, pill or capsule,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tablet or pill of this invention may be coated or compounded in other patterns so as to provide a dosage form which has an advantage to prolong the efficacy, or to protect the tablet or pill against the acidic environment in the stomach. For example, a tablet or pill may comprise internal dose and external dose components, wherein the latter exists in the form of coating on the top of the former. These two kinds of components can be separated by an enteric layer, which is to prevent the breakup in the stomach and to allow the internal component to enter the duodenum wholly or to be released slowly, A variety of materials can be used as the enteric layer or coating and the said materials include polymeric acids as well as the mixtures of the polymeric acids and the following materials, such as shellac, hexadecanol and cellulose acetate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions used in inhalation or insufflation include pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous or organic solvents, or the solutions and suspensions of the mixture, as well as pulvis. Liquid or solid compositions can comprise the suitable pharmaceutical excipients as mentioned above, Preferably, these compositions are administrated via oral route or nasal respiration so as to get partial or systemic effects. The compositions in the preferred pharmaceutically acceptable solvents can be atomized by using inert gases: the atomized solution may be sucked directly into an atomization device, or alternatively the atomization device may be connected to a face tent or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. The compositions of solutions, suspensions, or pulvis can be administrated by a device in a suitable route, preferably oral or nasal route, of delivering dosage forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this invention, the compounds and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof also include the forms of solvates or hydrates. Generally, the forms of solvates or hydrates are equal to the forms of non-solvates or non-hydrates, and covered in the scope of the invention. Some compounds in the present invention can probably exist in the form of polycrystal or amorphism. In short, all of the physical forms possess the equal uses and are covered in the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention also includes the prodrugs of the compounds. Prodrug is a pharmacological substance, derived from the parent drug, and will be metabolized into the parent drug once entering the body. The prodrug can be prepared by substituting one or more functional groups in the parent drug, which will be released once the substituted groups are degraded in vino, The preparation and the usage of prodrugs can be found in \nT.

The compounds in this invention can be prepared by the following methods and procedures.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe intermediate formula 1-5 can be prepared as shown in Scheme 1. 5-Bromo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-one and CuCN may be refluxed in DMF to obtain the cyano intermediate 1-1. Intermediate 1-1 may be reduced to the alcoholic intermediate 1-2 by treating with a reductant such as sodium borohydride in a solvent system such as methanol Intermediate 1-2 can react with thionyl chloride to get a chlorine group which will be replaced with a cyclic amino-group in the presence of triethylamine or potassium carbonate to obtain intermediate 1-4. The cyano-group in intermediate 1-4 may be hydrolyzed to obtain a carboxylic, acid, which will subsequently be treated with methanol and thionyl chloride to obtain compound 1-5. The two enantiomers of compound 1-4 or compound 1-5 can be separated by choral high performance liquid chromatography or by crystallization using camphorsulfonic acid.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the R\n1\n-subsituted 2,3-dihydroindene carboxylic acid (or its ester) can be prepared by the method depicted in Scheme 2. 5-Bromo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-one may be reduced to the alcoholic intermediate 2-1 by treating with a reductant such as sodium borobydride in a solvent system such as methanol. After the hydroxyl group of intermediate 2-1 is converted into chlorine by thionyl chloride, the chloride 2-2 can be replaced with a cyclic amino-group by using triethylamine or potassium carbonate as a base to obtain intermediate 2-3. Intermediate 2-3 can react with CO utilizing palladium, such as palladium diacetate / 1,3-bis-(phenylphosphine) propane (dppp) or bis-(triphenylphosphine) palladium dichloride (II)[(PPh\n3\n)\n2\nPdCl\n2\n] as catalysts to obtain the intermediate of formula 2-4 as a mixture of two enantiomers. When R of compound 2-4 is H, compound 2-4 can be obtained by treating compound 2-3 with butyllithium followed by quenching the reaction with carbon dioxide. The compound 2-3 and the two enantiomers of compound 2-4 can be separated by chiral high performance liquid chromatography or using chiral acids, such as by crystallization using camphorsulfonic acid.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinal compounds of formula 3-4 can be prepared as shown in Scheme 3, The carboxylic ester of intermediate 3-1 can be hydrolyzed by an alkali such as sodium hydroxide into carboxylic acid 3-2, which can be then condensed with an aniline derivative to obtain final compounds of formula 3-4 using coupling agents such as benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) or O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'- tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU). Addtionally, carboxylic acid 3-2 may be treated with thionyl chloride to form an acid chloride 3-3, which can then react with an aniline derivative to obtain compounds of formula 3-4. Final compounds of formula 3-4 may also be obtained via the reaction between the ester 3-1 and an aniline derivative utilizing trialkylaluminium such as trimethylaluminium or triethylaluminium as the coupling agent,\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPreparation of 1-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-N-(4-methyl-3-[(4-pyridin-3-ylpyrimidin-2-yl)amino] phenyl)-2,3-dihydro-1\nH\n-inden-5-carboxamide.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \nStep A: 1-Oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-5-carbonitrile\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5-Bromo-2,3-dihydro-1\nH\n-inden-1-one (21.1 g, 100 mmol) and cupric cyanide (17.9 g, 200 mmol) were mixed in 200 ml of dimethylformamide and stirred overnight at 140 °C After the solution was cooled down to room temperature, 500 ml of ethyl acetate was added and the precipitate was removed by filteration using kieselguhr.
