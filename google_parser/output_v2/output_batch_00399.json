Also provided are methods of their use for the treatment of an HCV infection in a host in need thereof\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nHepatitis C virus (HCV) is known to cause at least 80% of posttransfusion hepatitis and a substantial proportion of sporadic acute hepatitis (Kuo et al., \nScience \n1989, 244, 362-364; Thomas, \nCurr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. \n2000, 25-41). Preliminary evidence also implicates HCV in many cases of “idiopathic” chronic hepatitis, “cryptogenic” cirrhosis, and probably hepatocellular carcinoma unrelated to other hepatitis viruses, such as hepatitis B virus (Di Besceglie et al., \nScientific American, \n1999, October, 80-85; Boyer et al., \nJ. Hepatol. \n2000, 32, 98-112).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHCV is an enveloped virus containing a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 9.4 kb (Kato et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n1990, 87, 9524-9528; Kato, \nActa Medica Okayama, \n2001, 55, 133-159). The viral genome consists of a 5′ untranslated region (UTR), a long open reading frame encoding a polyprotein precursor of approximately 3011 amino acids, and a short 3′ UTR. The 5′ UTR is the most highly conserved part of the HCV genome and is important for the initiation and control of polyprotein translation. Translation of the HCV genome is initiated by a cap-independent mechanism known as an internal ribosome entry. This mechanism involves the binding of ribosomes to an RNA sequence known as the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). An RNA pseudoknot structure has recently been determined to be an essential structural element of the ICV IRES. Viral structural proteins include a nucleocapsid core protein (C) and two envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2. HCV also encodes two proteinases, a zinc-dependent metalloproteinase encoded by the NS2-NS3 region and a serine proteinase encoded in the NS3 region. These proteinases are required for cleavage of specific regions of the precursor polyprotein into mature peptides. The carboxyl half of nonstructural protein 5, NS5B, contains the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The function of the remaining nonstructural proteins, NS4A and NS4B, and that of NS5A (the amino-terminal half of nonstructural protein 5) remain unknown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPresently, the most effective HCV therapy employs a combination of alpha-interferon and ribavirin, leading to sustained efficacy in about 40% of patients (Poynard et al., \nLancet \n1998, 352, 1426-1432). Recent clinical results demonstrate that pegylated alpha-interferon is superior to unmodified alpha-interferon as monotherapy. However, even with experimental therapeutic regimens involving combinations of pegylated alpha-interferon and ribavirin, a substantial fraction of patients do not have a sustained reduction in viral load (Maims et al, \nLancet \n2001, 358, 958-965; Fried et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n2002, 347, 975-982; Hadziyannis et al., \nAnn. Intern. Med. \n2004, 140, 346-355). Thus, there is a clear and unmet need to develop effective therapeutics for treatment of HCV infection.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE\n\n\n \n \n \nProvided herein are macrocyclic serine protease inhibitor compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, and processes of preparation thereof.

In certain embodiments, an “isotopic variant” of a compound contains unnatural proportions of deuterium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “solvate” refers to a complex or aggregate formed by one or more molecules of a solute, e.g., a compound provided herein, and one or more molecules of a solvent, which present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount. Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, water, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, and acetic acid. In certain embodiments, the solvent is pharmaceutically acceptable. In one embodiment, the complex or aggregate is in a crystalline form. In another embodiment, the complex or aggregate is in a noncrystalline form. Where the solvent is water, the solvate is a hydrate. Examples of hydrates include, but are not limited to, a hemihydrate, monohydrate, dihydrate, trihydrate, tetrahydrate, and pentahydrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase “a single enantiomer, a racemic mixture, a mixture of diastereomers, or an isotopic variant thereof; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or prodrug thereof” has the same meaning as the phrase “a single enantiomer, a racemic mixture, a mixture of diastereomers, or an isotopic variant of the compound referenced therein; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or prodrug of the compound referenced therein, or a single enantiomer, a racemic mixture, a mixture of diastereomers, or an isotopic variant of the compound referenced therein.”\n\n\n \nCompounds\n\n\n \n \n \nHCV has a single positive-stranded RNA genome having about 9.6 kb in length that encodes a large polyprotein having about 3010 amino acids. This precursor polyprotein is then processed into a range of structural proteins, including core protein, C, and envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2; and non-structural proteins, including NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B, by host signal peptidases and two viral proteases, NS2-3 and NS3. The NS3 protein contains a trypsin-like serine protease domain at its N-terminus, while its C-terminal domain has helicase activity. Because of its vital role in viral replication, HCV NS3 serine protease has been actively pursued as a drug target for developing a new anti-HCV therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibitors of HCV NS3 protease that have been reported include linear and cyclic peptides and peptide mimetics, and non-peptide molecules (Llinas-Brunet et al., \nBioorg.

Where the compound provided herein contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, the compound may exist as one or a mixture of geometric cis/trans (or Z/E) isomers. Where structural isomers are interconvertible, the compound may exist as a single tautomer or a mixture of tautomers. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in the compound that contains, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group; or so-called valence tautomerism in the compound that contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the heterocyclic moiety that is fused with the macrocyclic ring in the compounds provided herein, including the compounds of Formulae Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb, IIIa, IIIb, IVa, IVb, Va, Vb, VIa, VIb, VIIa, VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, IXa, IXb, Xa, Xb, XIa, XIb, XIIa, XIIb, XIIIa, XIIIb, XIVa, XIVb, XVa, XVb, XVIa, XVIb, XIIa, XIIb, XIIIa, XIIIb, XIVa, and XIVb, contain three chiral centers as indicated by star symbols. As result, the heterocyclic moiety may exist in eight different stereoisomeric forms as shown below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heterocyclic moiety of a particular configuration can readily be introduced by selecting a chiral starting material that will yield the desired chirality.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds provided herein may be enantiomerically pure, such as a single enantiomer or a single diastereomer, or be stereoisomeric mixtures, such as a mixture of enantiomers, e.g., a racemic mixture of two enantiomers; or a mixture of two or more diastereomers. As such, one of skill in the art will recognize that administration of a compound in its (R) form is equivalent, for compounds that undergo epimerization in vivo, to administration of the compound in its (S) form. Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor, asymmetric synthesis from achiral starting materials, or resolution of an enantiomeric mixture, for example, chiral chromatography, recrystallization, resolution, diastereomeric salt formation, or derivatization into diastereomeric adducts followed by separation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compound provided herein contains an acidic or basic moiety, it may also be provided as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.

Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent compound. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent compound is not. The prodrug may also have enhanced solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent compound. A prodrug may be converted into the parent drug by various mechanisms, including enzymatic processes and metabolic hydrolysis.

For an example, a compound of Formula I can be prepared as shown in Scheme 1.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of R\n6\n-L groups can be introduced at the hydroxyl position compound 1a using various chemistries, such as coupling reactions to form ester, carbonate, or carbamate with the hydroxyl group, or nucleophilic substitution reactions to form ether, amine, or thioether. A nucleophilic substitution reaction to form an ether linkage is illustrated in Scheme 1. Compound 1a with a desired stereochemistry reacts with R\n6\n-L-V, where V is hydrogen or a metal ion or complex, with inversion of the stereochemistry at the position of the hydroxyl group to produce compound 1b. In the case of L is heteroatom, the reaction may be run under the Mitsunobu condition where V is hydrogen. Where L is a carbon atom moiety, the hydroxyl in compound 1a may be derivatized as a leaving group and reacted with R\n6\n-L-V, where V is a metal ion or complex. The carboxyl protecting group P\n1 \nis then selectively removed to produce a free acid 1c, which is coupled with compound 1d in the presence of a coupling reagent to form compound 1e. The carboxyl protecting group P\n2 \nis removed to form a free acid 1f, which is coupled with compound 1g in the presence of a coupling reagent to compound 1h. Compound 1h is cyclized in the presence of a metathesis catalyst to form macrocyclic compound 1. Suitable examples of metathesis catalysts can also be found, e.g., in U.S. Pat. Provisional Pat. Appl. Ser. Nos. 61/149,662, filed Feb. 3, 2009; and 61/231,408, filed Aug. 5, 2009; the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe starting materials used in the synthesis of the compounds provided herein are either commercially available or can be readily prepared.

No. 12/365,127, filed Feb. 3, 2009; and U.S. Provisional Pat. Appl. Ser. Nos. 61/167,847, filed Apr. 8, 2009, and 61/231,600, filed Aug. 5, 2009; the disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nProvided herein are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound provided herein, e.g., a compound of Formula Ia or Ib, as an active ingredient, including an enantiomer, a mixture of enantiomers, a mixture of two or more diastereomers, a tautomer, a mixture of two or more tautomers, or an isotopic variant thereof; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, or prodrug; in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, carrier, diluent, or excipient, or a mixture thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable excipients are well known to those skilled in the art, and non-limiting examples of suitable excipients are provided herein. Whether a particular excipient is suitable for incorporation into a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form depends on a variety of factors well known in the art, including, but not limited to, the method of administration. For example, oral dosage forms such as tablets may contain excipients not suited for use in parenteral dosage forms. The suitability of a particular excipient may also depend on the specific active ingredients in the dosage form. For example, the decomposition of some active ingredients may be accelerated by some excipients such as lactose, or when exposed to water. Active ingredients that comprise primary or secondary amines are particularly susceptible to such accelerated decomposition. Consequently, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that contain little, if any, lactose other mono- or di-saccharides. As used herein, the term “lactose-free” means that the amount of lactose present, if any, is insufficient to substantially increase the degradation rate of an active ingredient. In one embodiment, lactose-free compositions comprise an active ingredient provided herein, a binder/filler, and a lubricant. In another embodiment, lactose-free dosage founts comprise an active ingredient, microcrystalline cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, and magnesium stearate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound provided herein may be administered alone, or in combination with one or more other compounds provided herein.

Each unit-dose contains a predetermined quantity of an active ingredient(s) sufficient to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carriers or excipients. Examples of a unit-dosage form include an ampoule, syringe, and individually packaged tablet and capsule. For example, a 100 mg unit dose contains about 100 mg of an active ingredient in a packaged tablet or capsule. A unit-dosage form may be administered in fractions or multiples thereof. A multiple-dosage form is a plurality of identical unit-dosage forms packaged in a single container to be administered in segregated unit-dosage form. Examples of a multiple-dosage form include a vial, bottle of tablets or capsules, or bottle of pints or gallons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions provided herein can be administered at once, or multiple times at intervals of time.

Matrix Controlled Release Devices\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using a matrix controlled release device known to those skilled in the art. See, Takada et al. in \nEncyclopedia of Controlled Drug Delivery; \nMathiowitz Ed.; Wiley: 1999; Vol 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form is formulated using an erodible matrix device, which is water-swellable, erodible, or soluble polymers, including, but not limited to, synthetic polymers, and naturally occurring polymers and derivatives, such as polysaccharides and proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaterials useful in forming an erodible matrix include, but are not limited to, chitin, chitosan, dextran, and pullulan; gum agar, gum arabic, gum karaya, locust bean gum, gum tragacanth, carrageenans, gum ghatti, guar gum, xanthan gum, and scleroglucan; starches, such as dextrin and maltodextrin; hydrophilic colloids, such as pectin; phosphatides, such as lecithin; alginates; propylene glycol alginate; gelatin; collagen; cellulosics, such as ethyl cellulose (EC), methylethyl cellulose (MEC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), CMEC, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose propionate (CP), cellulose butyrate (CB), cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CAP, CAT, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), HPMCP, HPMCAS, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate trimellitate (HPMCAT), and ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose (EHEC); polyvinyl pyrrolidone; polyvinyl alcohol; polyvinyl acetate; glycerol fatty acid esters; polyacrylamide; polyacrylic acid; copolymers of ethacrylic acid or methacrylic acid (EUDRAGIT®, Rohm America, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.); poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate); polylactides; copolymers of L-glutamic acid and ethyl-L-glutamate; degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers; poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid; and other acrylic acid derivatives, such as homopolymers and copolymers of butylmethacrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, ethylacrylate, (2-dimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate, and (trimethylaminoethyl)methacrylate chloride.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are formulated with a non-erodible matrix device. The active ingredient(s) is dissolved or dispersed in an inert matrix and is released primarily by diffusion through the inert matrix once administered. Materials suitable for use as a non-erodible matrix device include, but are not limited to, insoluble plastics, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polymethylmethacrylate, polybutylmethacrylate, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, methyl acrylate-methyl methacrylate copolymers, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, vinyl chloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubbers, epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, ethylene/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, polyvinyl chloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized polyethylene terephthalate, natural rubber, silicone rubbers, polydimethylsiloxanes, and silicone carbonate copolymers; hydrophilic polymers, such as ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, crospovidone, and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate; and fatty compounds, such as carnauba wax, microcrystalline wax, and triglycerides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a matrix controlled release system, the desired release kinetics can be controlled, for example, via the polymer type employed, the polymer viscosity, the particle sizes of the polymer and/or the active ingredient(s), the ratio of the active ingredient(s) versus the polymer, and other excipients or carriers in the compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art, including direct compression, dry or wet granulation followed by compression, and melt-granulation followed by compression.\n\n\n \n2. Osmotic Controlled Release Devices\n\n\n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using an osmotic controlled release device, including, but not limited to, one-chamber system, two-chamber system, asymmetric membrane technology (AMT), and extruding core system (ECS). In general, such devices have at least two components: (a) a core which contains an active ingredient; and (b) a semipermeable membrane with at least one delivery port, which encapsulates the core. The semipermeable membrane controls the influx of water to the core from an aqueous environment of use so as to cause drug release by extrusion through the delivery port(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the active ingredient(s), the core of the osmotic device optionally includes an osmotic agent, which creates a driving force for transport of water from the environment of use into the core of the device. One class of osmotic agents is water-swellable hydrophilic polymers, which are also referred to as “osmopolymers” and “hydrogels.” Suitable water-swellable hydrophilic polymers as osmotic agents include, but are not limited to, hydrophilic vinyl and acrylic polymers, polysaccharides such as calcium alginate, polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic) acid, poly(methacrylic) acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), crosslinked PVP, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA/PVP copolymers, PVA/PVP copolymers with hydrophobic monomers such as methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, hydrophilic polyurethanes containing large PEO blocks, sodium croscarmellose, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carboxyethyl, cellulose (CEC), sodium alginate, polycarbophil, gelatin, xanthan gum, and sodium starch glycolate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe other class of osmotic agents is osmogens, which are capable of imbibing water to affect an osmotic pressure gradient across the barrier of the surrounding coating. Suitable osmogens include, but are not limited to, inorganic salts, such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium phosphates, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, lithium sulfate, potassium chloride, and sodium sulfate; sugars, such as dextrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, lactose, maltose, mannitol, raffinose, sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and xylitol; organic acids, such as ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, sebacic acid, sorbic acid, adipic acid, edetic acid, glutamic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid; urea; and mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOsmotic agents of different dissolution rates can be employed to influence how rapidly the active ingredient(s) is initially delivered from the dosage form. For example, amorphous sugars, such as MANNOGEM™ EZ (SPI Pharma. Lewes, Del.) can be used to provide faster delivery during the first couple of hours to promptly produce the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of the remaining amount to maintain the desired level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In this case, the active ingredient(s) is released at such a rate to replace the amount of the active ingredient metabolized and excreted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe core can also include a wide variety of other excipients and carriers as described herein to enhance the performance of the dosage form or to promote stability or processing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaterials useful in forming the semipermeable membrane include various grades of acrylics, vinyls, ethers, polyamides, polyesters, and cellulosic derivatives that are water-permeable and water-insoluble at physiologically relevant pHs, or are susceptible to being rendered water-insoluble by chemical alteration, such as crosslinking. Examples of suitable polymers useful in forming the coating, include plasticized, unplasticized, and reinforced cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, CA propionate, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CA ethyl carbamate, CAP, CA methyl carbamate, CA succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), CA dimethylaminoacetate, CA ethyl carbonate, CA chloroacetate, CA ethyl oxalate, CA methyl sulfonate, CA butyl sulfonate, CA p-toluene sulfonate, agar acetate, amylose triacetate, beta glucan acetate, beta glucan triacetate, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetate, triacetate of locust bean gum, hydroxylated ethylene-vinylacetate, EC, PEG, PPG, PEG/PPG copolymers, PVP, HEC, HPC, CMC, CMEC, HPMC, HPMCP, HPMCAS, HPMCAT, poly(acrylic) acids and esters and poly-(methacrylic) acids and esters and copolymers thereof, starch, dextran, dextrin, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, polyalkenes, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSemipermeable membrane can also be a hydrophobic microporous membrane, wherein the pores are substantially filled with a gas and are not wetted by the aqueous medium but are permeable to water vapor, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,119. Such hydrophobic but water-vapor permeable membrane are typically composed of hydrophobic polymers such as polyalkenes, polyethylene, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyacrylic acid derivatives, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe delivery port(s) on the semipermeable membrane can be formed post-coating by mechanical or laser drilling. Delivery port(s) can also be formed in situ by erosion of a plug of water-soluble material or by rupture of a thinner portion of the membrane over an indentation in the core. In addition, delivery ports can be formed during coating process, as in the case of asymmetric membrane coatings of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,612,059 and 5,698,220.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe total amount of the active ingredient(s) released and the release rate can substantially by modulated via the thickness and porosity of the semipermeable membrane, the composition of the core, and the number, size, and position of the delivery ports.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions in an osmotic controlled-release dosage foam can further comprise additional conventional excipients or carriers as described herein to promote performance or processing of the formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe osmotic controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art. See, \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \nsupra; Santus and Baker, \nJ.

Such multiparticulates can be made by the processes known to those skilled in the art, including wet-and dry-granulation, extrusion/spheronization, roller-compaction, melt-congealing, and by spray-coating seed cores. See, for example, \nMultiparticulate Oral Drug Delivery; \nGhebre-Sellassie Ed.; Marcel Dekker: 1994; and \nPharmaceutical Pelletization Technology; \nGhebre-Sellassie Ed.; Marcel Dekker: 1989.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther excipients or carriers as described herein can be blended with the pharmaceutical compositions to aid in processing and forming the multiparticulates. The resulting particles can themselves constitute the multiparticulate device or can be coated by various film-forming materials, such as enteric polymers, water-swellable, and water-soluble polymers.

The dose or sub-doses can be administered in the form of dosage units containing from about 0.1 to about 1,000 milligram, from about 0.1 to about 500 milligrams, or from 0.5 about to about 100 milligram active ingredient(s) per dosage unit, and if the condition of the patient requires, the dose can, by way of alternative, be administered as a continuous infusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, an appropriate dosage level is about 0.01 to about 100 mg per kg patient body weight per day (mg/kg per day), about 0.01 to about 50 mg/kg per day, about 0.01 to about 25 mg/kg per day, or about 0.05 to about 10 mg/kg per day, which may be administered in single or multiple doses.

Within this range the dosage may be about 0.01 to about 0.1, about 0.1 to about 1.0, about 1.0 to about 10, or about 10 to about 50 mg/kg per day.\n\n\n \nCombination Therapy\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds provided herein may also be combined or used in combination with other therapeutic agents useful in the treatment and/or prevention of an HCV infection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “in combination” includes the use of more than one therapy (e.g., one or more prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents). However, the use of the term “in combination” does not restrict the order in which therapies (e.g., prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents) are administered to a subject with a disease or disorder. A first therapy (e.g., a prophylactic or therapeutic agent such as a compound provided herein) can be administered prior to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks before), concomitantly with, or subsequent to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks after) the administration of a second therapy (e.g., a prophylactic or therapeutic agent) to the subject. Triple therapy is also contemplated herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “synergistic” includes a combination of a compound provided herein and another therapy (e.g., a prophylactic or therapeutic agent) which has been or is currently being used to prevent, treat, or manage a condition, disorder, or disease, which is more effective than the additive effects of the therapies. A synergistic effect of a combination of therapies (e.g., a combination of prophylactic or therapeutic agents) permits the use of lower dosages of one or more of the therapies and/or less frequent administration of said therapies to a subject with a condition, disorder, or disease. The ability to utilize lower dosages of a therapy (e.g., a prophylactic or therapeutic agent) and/or to administer said therapy less frequently reduces the toxicity associated with the administration of said therapy to a subject without reducing the efficacy of said therapy in the prevention, treatment, or management of a condition, disorder, or disease). In addition, a synergistic effect can result in improved efficacy of agents in the prevention, treatment, or management of a condition, disorder, or disease. Finally, a synergistic effect of a combination of therapies (e.g., a combination of prophylactic or therapeutic agents) may avoid or reduce adverse or unwanted side effects associated with the use of either therapy alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound provided herein can be administered in combination or alternation with another therapeutic agent, such as an anti-HCV agent. In combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more agents are administered together, whereas in alternation or sequential-step therapy, an effective dosage of each agent is administered serially or sequentially. The dosages given will depend on absorption, inactivation, and excretion rates of the drug as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. It is to be noted that dosage values will also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens and schedules should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been recognized that drug-resistant variants of HCV can emerge after prolonged treatment with an antiviral agent. Drug resistance most typically occurs due to the mutation of a gene that encodes for an enzyme used in viral replication. The efficacy of a drug against the viral infection can be prolonged, augmented, or restored by administering the compound in combination or alternation with a second, and perhaps third, antiviral compound that induces a different mutation from that caused by the principle drug. Alternatively, the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, or other parameters of the drug can be altered by such combination or alternation therapy. In general, combination therapy is typically preferred over alternation therapy because it induces multiple simultaneous stresses on the virus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein further comprise a second antiviral agent as described herein. In certain embodiments, the compound provided herein is combined with one or more agents selected from the group consisting of an interferon, ribavirin, amantadine, an interleukin, a NS3 protease inhibitor, a cysteine protease inhibitor, a phenanthrenequinone, a thiazolidine, a benzanilide, a helicase inhibitor, a polymerase inhibitor, a nucleotide analogue, a gliotoxin, a cerulenin, an antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide, an inhibitor of IRES-dependent translation, and a ribozyme.

In all cases, Huh-7 cells lacking the HCV replicon served as negative control. To assess luciferase expression, the media/compound was removed from the plates and ONE-glo Luciferase assay reagent (Promega) was added to each well. The assay plates were shaken for 3 minutes at room temperature and luciferase activity for each well was measured with a 1 sec read time on the Victor\n3\nV multilabel counter using a 700 nm cut-off filter (Perkin Elmer).

The mutant replicons bear a specific single-site mutation in NS3 that is known to confer resistance to protease inhibitors currently in development. The inhibition of HCV replication was measured by quantification of luciferase protein expression. This assay has been validated using a panel of replicons bearing known protease inhibitor resistance mutations and their respective reference compounds. Briefly, subconfluent cured GS4.1 cells in OptiBuffer (ThermoElectron Corp.) were electroporated with 40 μg of wild-type or mutant luciferase-bearing HCV replicon RNA. The cells were then seeded in 96-well opaque white plates at 2.4×10\n4 \ncells/well in 150 μL/well and incubated for 4 hours at 37° C./5% CO\n2\n. Ten 1:5 dilutions of each compound were made in Huh-7 media (DMEM containing glucose, L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM GlutaMAX, and 1× MEM non-essential amino acids [Mediatech, Inc. and Invitrogen Corp.]) at concentrations that were 4× higher than the final concentrations to be tested and 50 μL/well was added to the transfected cells. Untreated, mock-transfected cells served as a negative control of luciferase expression. The plates were incubated at 37° C./5% CO\n2 \nfor 4 days whereupon the media was removed and 50 μL of ONE-glo luciferase substrate (Promega) was added to each well. The plates were agitated on a rotating platform at room temperature for 3 minutes and read in a Victor\n3\nV microplate reader (Perkin-Elmer) using a 700 nm cut-off filter with a 1 second read time. EC\n50 \nvalues were calculated from dose response curves from the resulting best-fit equations determined by Microsoft Excel and XLfit 4.1 software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe table below presents data for compound 51.

The JFH-1 DNA template was derived synthetically using sequence information derived from NCBI Accession #AB047639 (Wakita, et al., \nNat. Med. \n2005, 11:791-796). Source: DNA2.0, Menlo Park, Calif.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cDNA for the JFH-1 HCV clone was synthesized by DNA2.0 and contains a T7 promoter to drive the transcription of the JFH-1 genomic RNA. This plasmid was amplified using the Hi-Speed Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThirty micrograms of purified DNA was digested overnight at 37° C. with 300 U XbaI. The digested DNA served as a template for the in vitro transcription of the JFH-1 genomic RNA using the MEGAScript T7 kit (Ambion) as instructed by the manufacturer. The JFH-1 RNA product was resuspended to 1 μg/μL in RNA storage solution (Ambion). The quality of the JFH-1 RNA was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (1.2% E-gel) prior to electroporation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComplete growth media for Huh-7 and HPC cells (Huh-7 media) was prepared as follows: DMEM (containing glucose, L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate), 10% FBS, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 1% MEM non-essential amino acids. Subconfluent HPC cells were treated with trypsin-EDTA, collected with Huh-7 media, and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 mM at 4° C. in an Allegra 6R centrifuge (Beckman Coulter) in a 50 mL conical tube. The cells were then rinsed twice by resuspending the cells in 50 mL of PBS and centrifuging at 1,500 rpm for 5 mM at 4° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nJFH-1 RNA was electroporated into HPC cells using a Thermo Scientific Hybaid OptiBuffer kit (containing buffer A, solution B and compounds C and D). After washing, the HPC cells were resuspended in OptiBuffer buffer A at 1×10\n7 \ncells/mL, and 400 μL (4×10\n6 \ncells) was transferred to a 1.5 mL RNase-free microfuge tube and gently centrifuged at 2,000 rpm in a Microfuge 18 (Beckman Coulter) centrifuge at room temperature for 5 minutes. During this centrifugation step, the electroporation medium was prepared by mixing 2.5 mL of OptiBuffer solution B with 1 vial of OptiBuffer compound C (5.5 mg of ATP), 1 vial of OptiBuffer compound D (7.7 mg of glutathione) and 2.5 mL of autoclaved water. After aspirating the supernatant, the cell pellet was resuspended in 400 μL of electroporation medium. JFH-1 RNA (8 μg) was added to the resuspended cells, whereupon they were transferred to a 0.4 cm cuvette and electroporated in a Bio-Rad GenePulser XCell electroporation module with a single pulse at 960 μf, 270 V and maximum resistance. A mock transfection, without RNA, was electroporated as a negative control. Growth media (600 μL) was immediately added to the cuvette. Cells were then transferred into a 15 mL conical tube containing 3.4 mL of Huh-7 media. Approximately 1.2×10\n5 \ncells were seeded into each well of a Corning Costar 6-well plate and incubated at 37° C. with 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen confluent, the transfected HPC cells were trypsinized and split 1:5 into new 6-well plates. At day 5 and 14 post transfection, conditioned media was collected from the cultures, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min in a table-top centrifuge (Beckman Coulter Allegra 6R with GH3.8 rotor) and media was filtered through a 0.2 μm syringe-top filter. The transfected cells were also fixed for immunohistochemistry and lysed for immunoblotting analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recombinant JFH-1 HCV virus was amplified in a manner described by (Zhong, et al., \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. \n2005, 102:9294-9299). HPC cells were split to 10% confluency in 225 cm\n2 \nflasks and infected with 1 mL of the transfected cell culture media (described above) at 5 hrs post seeding. At 5 days post infection (p.i.), the cultures were split 1:2 into new 225 cm\n2 \nflasks. One half the initial culture media was carried over into the split cultures to facilitate virus amplification. At 10 day p.i., conditioned media was collected from the 225 cm\n2 \nflasks, centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min in a table-top centrifuge and filtered through a MF75 sterilization filter (0.45 μm) bottle-top unit. Two milliliter aliquots of this virus stock were stored at −80° C. for future use.\n\n\n \nExample 7 \n\n\nHCV In Vitro Infection Core ELISA Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe HCV in vitro infection core ELISA assay measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit replication of an infectious HCV (strain JFH-1; genotype 2a) in cell culture. Recently, an in vitro infection model identified by Wakita et al. (\nNat. Med. \n2005, 11:791-796) was found to replicate in retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-deficient or cluster of differentiation (CD)-81-positive Huh-7 hepatoma cell lines. We have developed this model for deteiinining the efficacy of antiviral compounds against an infectious virus in vitro using HCV producing cells (HPC), a proprietary Huh-7-derived cell sublineage capable of propagating the JFH-1 HCV virus. The readout of the assay is quantification of HCV core protein by ELISA 5 days post infection with JFH-1 virus and treatment with a test compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNinety-six-well Corning Costar plates were seeded with HPC cells at a density of 3.0×10\n3 \ncells per well in 50 μL of Huh-7 media. Compound stock solutions were made up freshly in Huh-7 media (DMEM (containing glucose, L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate), 10% FBS, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM G1utaMAX, 1% MEM non-essential amino acids) as 2× stock. Seven additional 3-fold drug dilutions were prepared from the 2× stocks in Huh-7 media. At least 4 hours after HPC cells were seeded, the media in the 96-well culture plates was aspirated and 50 μL of each drug dilution and 50 μL of JFH-1 HCV was added to each well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt 16 hrs post treatment and infection, the virus inoculum was removed by aspiration. The cultures were treated at the same final concentrations of drug diluted to 1× in Huh-7 media to a final volume of 200 μL. Cells were incubated in the presence of drug for 4 additional days at 37° C./5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMedia was removed from the plates by aspiration. Cells were fixed with 250 μL, 1:1 acetone:methanol for 90 seconds, washed once in PBS and then three times with 1×KPL wash solution. The assay plates were then blocked with 150 μL/well 10% FBS-TNE (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5; Sigma), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA with 10% FBS) for 1 hr at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with 1×KPL wash solution and incubated with 100 μL/well anti-hepatitis C core mAb (1 mg/mL stock diluted 1:500 in 10% FBS-TNE) for 2 hours at 37° C. Cells were washed three times with 1×KPL wash solution and incubated with 100 μL/well HRP-goat anti-mouse antibody (diluted 1:2,500 in 10% PBS-TNE) for 1 hr at 37° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOPD solution was prepared using 1 OPD tablet+12 mL citrate/phosphate buffer (16 mM citric acid, 27 mM Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n) plus 5 μL 30% H\n2\nO\n2 \nper plate. Cells were washed three times with 1×KPL wash solution and developed with 100 μL/well OPD solution for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 100 μL/well of 2N H\n2\nSO\n4\n, and absorbance measured at A\n490 \nnm in a Victor\n3 \nV 1420 multilabel counter (Perkin Elmer). The EC\n50 \nvalues for each compound were calculated from dose response curves from the resulting best-fit equations determined by Microsoft Excel and XLfit 4.1 software. The negative control for inhibition of virus replication was untreated HPC cells infected with the JFH-1 HCV virus strain. The negative ELISA control was untreated, uninfected HPC cells. The positive ELISA control was untreated HPC cells infected the JFH-1 HCV virus strain.\n\n\n \nExample 8 \n\n\nMTS Cytotoxicity Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cytotoxicity assay measures the viability of cells after treatment with a test compound for 5 days. The assay readout is the bioreduction of the yellow MTS tetrazolium compound to a purple formazan product. This conversion is mediated by NADPH or NADH and is directly proportional to the number of live cells in a culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNinety-six-well Corning Costar plates were seeded with HPC cells at a density of 3.0×10\n3 \ncells per well in 50 μL of Huh-7 media. Compound stock solutions were made up freshly in Huh-7 media as 2× stocks. Seven additional 3-fold drug dilutions were prepared from the 2× stocks in Huh-7 media for a total of 8 dilutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt least 4 hours after HPC cells were seeded, 50 μL of each drug dilution was added to the cultures. At 16 hrs post treatment, the existing media was removed by aspiration. Cultures were treated at the same final concentrations of drug diluted to 1× in Huh-7 medium to a final volume of 100 μL. Cells were incubated for 4 additional days at 37° C./5% CO\n2 \nin the presence of drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter 5 days of treatment, the CellTiter 96® Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay was performed by adding 20 μL of MTS solution to each well. The plates were then incubated at 37° C./5% CO\n2 \nfor 3 hours. Plates were read at A\n490 \nnm in a Victor\n3 \nV 1420 multilabel counter (Perkin Elmer) and CC\n50 \nconcentrations were determined using Microsoft Excel and XLfit 4.1 software. The positive control for cell death: culture wells containing only Huh-7 medium. The negative control for cell death: culture wells containing untreated, uninfected HPC cells.\n\n\n \nExample 9 \n\n\nHCV In Vitro Infection Western Blotting Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit replication of the JFH-1 HCV strain in cell culture. The readout of the assay is the quantification of HCV NS3 or core protein by western blotting 5 days post infection with JFH-1 virus and drug treatment. Negative controls: untreated, uninfected HPC cells. Positive controls: untreated HPC cells infected the JFH-1 HCV virus strain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwenty-four-well Coming Costar plates were seeded with HPC cells at a density of 1.5×10\n4 \ncells per well in 0.8 mL of Huh-7 media (DMEM (containing glucose, L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate), 10% FBS, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 2 mM GlutaMAX, 1% MEM non-essential amino acids). Compound stock solutions were made up freshly in Huh-7 media as 10× stocks. Four additional 5-fold drug dilutions were prepared from the 10× stocks in Huh-7 media for a total of 5 dilutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt least 3 hrs after HPC cells were seeded, 100 tL of each drug dilution and 100 μL of JFH-1 HCV was added to each well. At 16 hrs post treatment and infection, the virus inoculum was removed by aspiration. The cultures were treated at the same final concentrations of drug diluted to 1× in Huh-7 media to a final volume of 1 mL. Cells were incubated in the presence of drug for 4 additional days at 37° C./5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMedia was removed from the plates by aspiration and the cells washed with 1 mL of PBS. After removing the PBS, 100 μL/well of SDS sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 2% ultrapure SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 0.1 M DTT) was added. The samples were collected into RNase-free microfuge tubes, incubated at 95° C. for 5-10 minutes and centrifuged at maximum speed for 2 min in an Eppendorf 5415D centrifuge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo prepare the Western Blot, fifteen microliters of each sample was loaded into each lane of a 4-20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel in an XCell II Blot Module (Invitrogen); 6 μL of the SeeBluePlus2 prestained protein standard was also loaded into one lane. Each gel was run at 125 V for 1.5 hrs in Novex SDS (1× Tris/glycine/SDS) running buffer (Invitrogen). Each gel was transferred onto an iBlot nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot apparatus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The membrane was rinsed in PBST (Sigma) and then blocked with 6 mL of blocking buffer (5% (w/v) nonfat milk in PBST solution) at room temperature for 1 hour with rocking. Each blot was incubated in 6 mL of blocking buffer containing HCV NS3 murine mAb (1:500; ViroGen Corp.) and anti-GAPDH murine IgG Ab (1:1,000,000; Calbiotech) or anti-core mAb (1:500; Affinity BioReagents) overnight at 4° C. with rocking. After 3 ten minute washes in PBST at room temperature with rocking each blot was incubated with 6 mL of blocking buffer (5% (w/v) nonfat milk in PBST solution) containing HRP conjugated donkey anti-mouse Ab (1:5,000) for 1 hour at room temperature with rocking. Each blot was washed as described above and then exposed to 5 mL of substrate from the SuperSignal West Dura substrate kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The blots were then exposed using the Florochem 5,500 imager (Alpha Innotech).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVirus replication was quantified by determining the band densities of NS3 and core proteins using ImageQuant 5.2 software. Background (the density determined within the NS3 or core region with mock-transfected cells) was subtracted from NS3, core, and GAPDH band densities. Each corrected NS3 or core value was then normalized to the corresponding corrected GAPDH value for the same sample. The EC\n50 \nvalue, which is the concentration of a test compound that reduced NS3 or core protein production by 50%, was determined for each compound using Microsoft Excel and XLfit 4.1 software. Each EC\n50 \nvalue determination was performed in duplicate.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nPreparation of N-methyl-ω-alkenyl-1-amine tosylate salts 31\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe syntheses of N-methyl-ω-alkenyl-1-amine tosylate salts 31 are shown in Scheme 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStep A: Preparation of 2,2,2-trifluoro-N-(hex-5-enyl)-N-methylacetamide 31A.

Field of the Invention\n\n\nThe present invention relates to compounds and methods of synthetic preparation in the fields of chemistry and medicine. More specifically, the present invention relates to compounds and procedures for making compounds useful in the treatment of cancer and the treatment of fungal infections.\n\n\n2. Brief Description of the Related Art\n\n\nIt is thought that a single, universal cellular mechanism controls the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle process. See, e.g., Hartwell, L. H. et al., Science (1989), 246: 629-34. It is also known that when an abnormality arises in the control mechanism of the cell cycle, cancer or an immune disorder may occur. Accordingly, as is also known, antitumor agents and immune suppressors may be among the substances that regulate the cell cycle. Thus, new methods for producing eukaryotic cell cycle inhibitors are needed as antitumor and immune-enhancing compounds, and should be useful in the treatment of human cancer as chemotherapeutic, anti-tumor agents. See, e.g., Roberge, M. et al., Cancer Res. (1994), 54, 6115-21.\n\n\nFungi, especially pathogenic fungi and related infections, represent an increasing clinical challenge. Existing antifungal agents are of limited efficacy and toxicity, and the development and/or discovery of strains of pathogenic fungi that are resistant to drugs currently available or under development. By way of example, fungi that are pathogenic in humans include among others \nCandida \nspp. including \nC. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. kefyr, C. krusei \nand \nC. glabrata; Aspergillus \nspp. including \nA. fumigatus \nand \nA. flavus; Cryptococcus neoformans; Blastomyces \nspp. including \nBlastomyces dermatitidis; Pneumocystis carinii; Coccidioides immitis; Basidiobolus ranarum; Conidiobolus \nspp.; \nHistoplasma capsulatum; Rhizopus \nspp. including \nR. oryzae \nand \nR. microsporus; Cunninghamella \nspp.; \nRhizomucor \nspp.; \nParacoccidioides brasiliensis; Pseudallescheria boydii; Rhinosporidium seeberi\n; and \nSporothrix schenckii \n(Kwon-Chung, K. J. & Bennett, J. E. 1992 Medical Mycology, Lea and Febiger, Malvern, Pa.).\n\n\nRecently, it has been reported that tryprostatins A and B (which are diketopiperazines consisting of proline and isoprenylated tryptophan residues), and five other structurally-related diketopiperazines, inhibited cell cycle progression in the M phase, see Cui, C. et al., 1996 \nJ Antibiotics \n49:527-33; Cui, C. et al. 1996 \nJ Antibiotics \n49:534-40, and that these compounds also affect the microtubule assembly, see Usui, T. et al. 1998 \nBiochem J \n333:543-48; Kondon, M. et al. 1998 \nJ Antibiotics \n51:801-04. Furthermore, natural and synthetic compounds have been reported to inhibit mitosis, thus inhibit the eukaryotic cell cycle, by binding to the colchicine binding-site (CLC-site) on tubulin, which is a macromolecule that consists of two 50 kDa subunits (α- and β-tubulin) and is the major constituent of microtubules. See, e.g., Iwasaki, S., 1993 \nMed Res Rev \n13:183-198; Hamel, E. 1996 \nMed Res Rev \n16:207-31; Weisenberg, R. C. et al., 1969 \nBiochemistry \n7:4466-79. Microtubules are thought to be involved in several essential cell functions, such as axonal transport, cell motility and determination of cell morphology. Therefore, inhibitors of microtubule function may have broad biological activity, and be applicable to medicinal and agrochemical purposes. It is also possible that colchicine (CLC)-site ligands such as CLC, steganacin, see Kupchan, S. M. et al., 1973 \nJ Am Chem Soc \n95:1335-36, podophyllotoxin, see Sackett, D. L., 1993 \nPharmacol Ther \n59:163-228, and combretastatins, see Pettit, G. R. et al., 1995 \nJ Med Chem \n38:166-67, may prove to be valuable as eukaryotic cell cycle inhibitors and, thus, may be useful as chemotherapeutic agents.\n\n\nAlthough diketopiperazine-type metabolites have been isolated from various fungi as mycotoxins, see Horak R. M. et al., 1981 \nJCS Chem Comm \n1265-67; Ali M. et al., 1898 Toxicology Letters 48:235-41, or as secondary metabolites, see Smedsgaard J. et al., 1996 \nJ Microbiol Meth \n25:5-17, little is known about the specific structure of the diketopiperazine-type metabolites or their derivatives and their antitumor activity, particularly in vivo. Not only have these compounds been isolated as mycotoxins, the chemical synthesis of one type of diketopiperazine-type metabolite, phenylahistin, has been described by Hayashi et al. in \nJ. Org. Chem. \n(2000) 65, page 8402. In the art, one such diketopiperazine-type metabolite derivative, dehydrophenylahistin, has been prepared by enzymatic dehydrogenation of its parent phenylahistin. With the incidences of cancer on the rise, there exists a particular need for chemically producing a class of substantially purified diketopiperazine-type metabolite-derivatives having animal cell-specific proliferation-inhibiting activity and high antitumor activity and selectivity. There is therefore a particular need for an efficient method of synthetically producing substantially purified, and structurally and biologically characterized diketopiperazine-type metabolite-derivatives.\n\n\nAlso, PCT Publication WO/0153290 (Jul. 26, 2001) describes a non-synthetic method of producing dehydrophenylahistin by exposing phenylahistin or a particular phenylahistin analog to a dehydrogenase obtained from \nStreptomyces albulus. \n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nCompounds, and methods for the synthetic manufacture of compounds, are disclosed for a class of compounds having the structure of Formula (I):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disclosed compounds have the structure of Formula (I) wherein:\n\n\nR\n1\n, R\n4\n, and R\n6\n, are each separately selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, and saturated C\n1\n-C\n24 \nalkyl, unsaturated C\n1\n-C\n24 \nalkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, alkoxy, cycloalkoxy, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, amino, substituted amino, nitro, azido, substituted nitro, phenyl, and substituted phenyl groups, hydroxy, carboxy, cyano, alkylthio, halogenated alkyl including polyhalogenated alkyl, halogenated carbonyl, and carbonyl —CCO—R\n7\n, wherein R\n7 \nis selected from a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, and saturated C\n1\n-C\n24 \nalkyl, unsaturated C\n1\n-C\n24 \nalkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, alkoxy, cycloalkoxy, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, amino, substituted amino, nitro, azido, substituted nitro, phenyl, and substituted phenyl groups;\n\n\nR\n1\n′ and R\n1\n″ are independently selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, and saturated C\n1\n-C\n24 \nalkyl, unsaturated C\n1\n-C\n24 \nalkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, alkoxy, cycloalkoxy, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, amino, substituted amino, nitro, azido, substituted nitro, phenyl, and substituted phenyl groups, hydroxy, carboxy, cyano, alkylthio, halogenated alkyl including polyhalogenated alkyl, halogenated carbonyl, and carbonyl —CCO—R\n7\n, wherein R\n7 \nis selected from a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, and saturated C\n1\n-C\n24 \nalkyl, unsaturated C\n1\n-C\n24 \nalkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, alkoxy, cycloalkoxy, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, amino, substituted amino, nitro, azido, substituted nitro, phenyl, and substituted phenyl groups;\n\n\nR\n2\n, R\n3\n, and R\n5 \nare each separately selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, and saturated C\n1\n-C\n12 \nalkyl, unsaturated C\n1\n-C\n12 \nalkenyl, acyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, cycloalkoxy, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, substituted heteroaryl, amino, substituted amino, nitro, and substituted nitro groups, sulfonyl and substituted sulfonyl groups;\n\n\nX\n1 \nand X\n2 \nare separately selected from the group consisting of an oxygen atom, a nitrogen atom, and a sulfur atom, each either unsubstituted or substituted with a R\n5 \ngroup, as defined above;\n\n\nY is selected from the group consisting of a nitrogen atom, a substituted nitrogen atom with a R\n5 \ngroup from above, an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, a oxidized sulfur atom, a methylene group and a substituted methylene group;\n\n\nn is an integer equal to zero, one or two;\n\n\nZ, for each separate n, if non-zero, and Z\n1\n, Z\n2\n, Z\n3 \nand Z\n4 \nare each separately selected from a carbon atom, a sulfur atom, a nitrogen atom or an oxygen atom;

The inert atmosphere circumvents the probable oxidation of activated α-carbon atoms of the diketopiperazine ring during the treatment with cesium carbonate (see below) as reported, for example, by Watanabe et al., 18\nth \n \nInternational Congress of Heterocyclic Chemistry in Yokohama, Japan \n(30 Jul. 2001), Abstract, \npage\n 225.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther embodiments of the synthetic method involve modifications to the compounds used in or otherwise involved in the synthesis of compounds represented by Formula (I). Such derivatives may include modifications to the phenyl ring, introduction of other aromatic ring systems, position of the aromatic ring, alterations to the imidazole ring system and/or further modifications to the 5-position on the imidazole ring. Examples of such modifications are discussed, for example, in Example 4. The result of such modifications include increased nitrogen content of the phenyl ring and/or the compound which may increase compound solubility. Other modifications may incorporate derivatives of known tubulin inhibitors, thereby mimicking the activity of the tubulin inhibitors.

When administered orally, it can be administered in capsule, tablet, granule, spray, syrup, or other such form. When administered non-orally, it can be administered as an aqueous suspension, an oily preparation or the like or as a drip, suppository, salve, ointment or the like, when administered via injection or infusion, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously, intramuscularly, or the like. Similarly, it may be administered topically, rectally, or vaginally, as deemed appropriate by those of skill in the art for bringing the compound into optimal contact with a tumor, thus inhibiting the growth of the tumor. Local administration at the site of the tumor is also contemplated, either before or after tumor resection, as are controlled release formulations, depot formulations, and infusion pump delivery.\n\n\nMethods of Administration\n\n\nThe present invention also encompasses methods for making and for administering the disclosed chemical compounds and the disclosed pharmaceutical compositions. Such disclosed methods include, among others, (a) administration though oral pathways, which administration includes administration in capsule, tablet, granule, spray, syrup, or other such forms; (b) administration through non-oral pathways, which administration includes administration as an aqueous suspension, an oily preparation or the like or as a drip, suppository, salve, ointment or the like; administration via injection or infusion, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously, intramuscularly, intradermally, or the like; as well as (c) administration topically, (d) administration rectally, or (e) administration vaginally, as deemed appropriate by those of skill in the art for bringing the compound into contact with living tissue; and (f) administration via controlled released formulations, depot formulations, and infusion pump delivery. As further examples of such modes of administration and as further disclosure of modes of administration, disclosed herein are various methods for administration of the disclosed chemical compounds and pharmaceutical compositions including modes of administration through intraocular, intranasal, and intraauricular pathways.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutically effective amount of the dehydrophenylahistin or dehydrophenylahistin analog composition required as a dose will depend on the route of administration, the type of animal, including human, being treated, and the physical characteristics of the specific animal under consideration. The dose can be tailored to achieve a desired effect, but will depend on such factors as weight, diet, concurrent medication and other factors which those skilled in the medical arts will recognize.\n\n\nIn practicing the methods, the products or compositions can be used alone or in combination with one another, or in combination with other therapeutic or diagnostic agents. For example, as disclosed herein, the compounds disclosed herein are effective in the treatment of cancer when used in combination with other actives, specifically other chemotherapeutics, for example biologics and the specific chemotherapeutics CPT-11, Taxotene (docataxel) and pacitaxel. The compounds disclosed herein are also effective in the treatment of cancer when used in combination with other actives, including anti-vascular agents, anti-angiogenic agents, such as Erbitux (Imclone/bristol-Myers) and Iressa (AstraZeneca), other VEGF inhibitors and biologics, more specifically, at least one anti-VEGF antibodies, especially monoclonal antibodies to the VEGF receptor, including DC101, a rat monoclonal antibody, which blocks the mouse VEGF receptor 2 (flk-1). Such combinations may be utilized in vivo, ordinarily in a mammal, preferably in a human, or in vitro. In employing them in vivo, the disclosed compounds, alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutics or other biologic products, may be administered to the mammal in a variety of ways, including parenterally, intravenously, via infusion or injection, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, colonically, rectally, vaginally, nasally or intraperitoneally, employing a variety of dosage forms. Such methods may also be applied to testing chemical activity in vivo.\n\n\nAs will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, the useful in vivo dosage to be administered and the particular mode of administration will vary depending upon the age, weight and mammalian species treated, the particular compounds employed, and the specific use for which these compounds are employed. The determination of effective dosage levels, that is the dosage levels necessary to achieve the desired result, can be accomplished by one skilled in the art using routine pharmacological methods. Typically, human clinical applications of products are commenced at lower dosage levels, with dosage level being increased until the desired effect is achieved. Alternatively, acceptable in vitro studies can be used to establish useful doses and routes of administration of the compositions identified by the present methods using established pharmacological methods.\n\n\nIn non-human animal studies, applications of potential products are commenced at higher dosage levels, with dosage being decreased until the desired effect is no longer achieved or adverse side effects disappear. The dosage may range broadly, depending upon the desired affects and the therapeutic indication. Typically, dosages may be between about 10 microgram/kg and 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably between about 100 microgram/kg and 10 mg/kg body weight. Alternatively dosages may be based and calculated upon the surface area of the patient, as understood by those of skill in the art. Administration may be oral on an every third day, every other day, daily, twice daily, or thrice daily basis.\n\n\nThe exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. See for example, Fingl et al., in The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 1975. It should be noted that the attending physician would know how to and when to terminate, interrupt, or adjust administration due to toxicity, or to organ dysfunctions. Conversely, the attending physician would also know to adjust treatment to higher levels if the clinical response were not adequate (precluding toxicity). The magnitude of an administrated dose in the management of the disorder of interest will vary with the severity of the condition to be treated and to the route of administration. The severity of the condition may, for example, be evaluated, in part, by standard prognostic evaluation methods. Further, the dose and perhaps dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, body weight, and response of the individual patient. A program comparable to that discussed above may be used in veterinary medicine.\n\n\nDepending on the specific conditions being treated, such agents may be formulated and administered systemically or locally. A variety of techniques for formulation and administration may be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (1990). Suitable administration routes may include oral, rectal, transdermal, vaginal, transmucosal, or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, via infusion, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections.\n\n\nFor injection or infusion, the agents may be formulated in aqueous solutions, for example, in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks' solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For such transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. Use of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to formulate the compounds herein disclosed for the practice of the invention into dosages suitable for systemic administration is within the scope of the invention. With proper choice of carrier and suitable manufacturing practice, the compositions disclosed herein, in particular, those formulated as solutions, may be administered parenterally, such as by intravenous injection or infusion. The compounds can be formulated readily using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art into dosages suitable for oral administration. Such carriers enable the compounds to be formulated as tablets, pills, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated.\n\n\nAgents intended to be administered intracellularly may be administered using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, such agents may be encapsulated into liposomes, then administered as described above. All molecules present in an aqueous solution at the time of liposome formation are incorporated into the aqueous interior. The liposomal contents are both protected from the external micro-environment and, because liposomes fuse with cell membranes, are efficiently delivered into the cell cytoplasm. Additionally, due to their hydrophobicity, small organic molecules may be directly administered intracellularly.\n\n\nDetermination of the effective amounts is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein. In addition to the active ingredients, these pharmaceutical compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. The preparations formulated for oral administration may be in the form of tablets, dragees, capsules, or solutions. The pharmaceutical compositions may be manufactured in a manner that is itself known, for example, by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levitating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilizing processes.\n\n\nCompounds disclosed herein can be evaluated for efficacy and toxicity using known methods. For example, the toxicology of a particular compound, or of a subset of the compounds, sharing certain chemical moieties, may be established by determining in vitro toxicity towards a cell line, such as a mammalian, and preferably human, cell line. The results of such studies are often predictive of toxicity in animals, such as mammals, or more specifically, humans. Alternatively, the toxicity of particular compounds in an animal model, such as mice, rats, rabbits, or monkeys, may be determined using known methods. The efficacy of a particular compound may be established using several art recognized methods, such as in vitro methods, animal models, or human clinical trials. Art-recognized in vitro models exist for nearly every class of condition, including the conditions abated by the compounds disclosed herein, including cancer, cardiovascular disease and various fungal infections. Similarly, acceptable animal models may be used to establish efficacy of chemicals to treat such conditions. When selecting a model to determine efficacy, the skilled artisan can be guided by the state of the art to choose an appropriate model, dose, and route of administration, and regime. Of course, human clinical trials can also be used to determine the efficacy of a compound in humans.\n\n\nWhen used as an anti-cancer agent, or a tumor-growth-inhibiting compound, the compounds disclosed herein may be administered by either oral or a non-oral pathways. When administered orally, it can be administered in capsule, tablet, granule, spray, syrup, or other such form. When administered non-orally, it can be administered as an aqueous suspension, an oily preparation or the like or as a drip, suppository, salve, ointment or the like, when administered via injection or infusion, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously, intramuscularly, intradermally, or the like. Similarly, it may be administered topically, rectally, or vaginally, as deemed appropriate by those of skill in the art for bringing the compound into optimal contact with a tumor, thus inhibiting the growth of the tumor. Local administration at the site of the tumor or other disease condition is also contemplated, either before or after tumor resection, or as part of an art-recognized treatment of the disease condition. Controlled release formulations, depot formulations, and infusion pump delivery are similarly contemplated.\n\n\nWhen used as an anti-cancer agent or an anti-tumor agent, may be orally or non-orally administered to a human patient in the amount of about 0.0007 mg/day to about 7,000 mg/day of the active ingredient, and more preferably about 0.07 mg/day to about 70 mg/day of the active ingredient at, preferably, one time per day or, less preferably, over two to about ten times per day. Alternatively and also preferably, the compound may preferably be administered in the stated amounts continuously by, for example, an intravenous drip. Thus, for a patient weighing 70 kilograms, the preferred daily dose of the active anti-tumor ingredient would be about 0.0007 mg/kg/day to about 35 mg/kg/day including 1.0 mg/kg/day and 0.5 mg/kg/day, and more preferable, from 0.007 mg/kg/day to about 0.050 mg/kg/day, including 0.035 mg/kg/day. Nonetheless, as will be understood by those of skill in the art, in certain situations it may be necessary to administer the anti-tumor compound in amounts that excess, or even far exceed, the above-stated, preferred dosage range to effectively and aggressively treat particularly advanced or lethal tumors.\n\n\nWhen used as an antifungal agent the preferable amount of the dehydrophenylahistin or its analog effective in the treatment or prevention of a particular fungal pathogen will depend in part on the characteristics of the fungus and the extent of infection, and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In vitro or in vivo assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro analysis or preferably from animal models. The precise dosage level should be determined by the attending physician or other health care provider and will depend upon well known factors, including route of administration, and the age, body weight, sex and general health of the individual; the nature, severity and clinical stage of the infection; the use (or not) of concomitant therapies.\n\n\nThe effective dose of the dehydrophenylahistin or its analog will typically be in the range of about 0.01 to about 50 mg/kg, preferably about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg of mammalian body weight per day, administered in single or multiple doses. Generally, the compound may be administered to patients in need of such treatment in a daily dose range of about 1 to about 2000 mg per patient.\n\n\nTo formulate the dosage including the compounds disclosed herein as a tumor-growth-inhibiting compound, known surface active agents, excipients, smoothing agents, suspension agents and pharmaceutically acceptable film-forming substances and coating assistants, and the like may be used. Preferably alcohols, esters, sulfated aliphatic alcohols, and the like may be used as surface active agents; sucrose, glucose, lactose, starch, crystallized cellulose, mannitol, light anhydrous silicate, magnesium aluminate, magnesium methasilicate aluminate, synthetic aluminum silicate, calcium carbonate, sodium acid carbonate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, and the like may be used as excipients; magnesium stearate, talc, hardened oil and the like may be used as smoothing agents; coconut oil, olive oil, sesame oil, peanut oil, soya may be used as suspension agents or lubricants; cellulose acetate phthalate as a derivative of a carbohydrate such as cellulose or sugar, or methylacetate-methacrylate copolymer as a derivative of polyvinyl may be used as suspension agents; and plasticizers such as ester phthalates and the like may be used as suspension agents. In addition to the foregoing preferred ingredients, sweeteners, fragrances, colorants, preservatives and the like may be added to the administered formulation of the compound, particularly when the compound is to be administered orally.\n\n\nThe compositions disclosed herein in a pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions may be prepared for storage and for subsequent administration. Acceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985). For example, such compositions may be formulated and used as tablets, capsules or solutions for oral administration; suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration; sterile solutions or suspensions for injectable administration. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection or infusion, or as emulsions. Suitable excipients include, but are not limited to, saline, dextrose, mannitol, lactose, lecithin, albumin, sodium glutamate, cysteine hydrochloride, and the like. In addition, if desired, the injectable pharmaceutical compositions may contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting agents, pH buffering agents, and the like. If desired, absorption enhancing preparations (for example, liposomes), may be utilized.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutically effective amount of the composition required as a dose will depend on the route of administration, the type of animal being treated, and the physical characteristics of the specific animal under consideration. The dose can be tailored to achieve a desired effect, but will depend on such factors as weight, diet, concurrent medication and other factors which those skilled in the medical arts will recognize.\n\n\nThe products or compositions, as described above, may be used alone or in combination with one another, or in combination with other therapeutic or diagnostic agents. Specifically, the disclosed compounds products may be used alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutics or bioloigics, including antibodies, for the treatment of cancer, or in combination with other antiinfective for the treatment of fungal infection. These products or composition can be utilized in vivo or in vitro. The useful dosages and the most useful modes of administration will vary depending upon the age, weight and animal treated, the particular compounds employed, and the specific use for which these composition or compositions are employed. The magnitude of a dose in the management or treatment for a particular disorder will vary with the severity of the condition to be treated and to the route of administration, and depending on the disease conditions and their severity, the compositions may be formulated and administered either systemically or locally. A variety of techniques for formulation and administration may be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (1990).\n\n\nTo formulate the compounds of Formula (I), preferably synthetically produced according to the methods disclosed herein, as a cell cycle inhibitor, a tumor-growth-inhibiting, or an antifungal compound, known surface active agents, excipients, smoothing agents, suspension agents and pharmaceutically acceptable film-forming substances and coating assistants, and the like may be used. Preferably alcohols, esters, sulfated aliphatic alcohols, and the like may be used as surface active agents; sucrose, glucose, lactose, starch, crystallized cellulose, mannitol, light anhydrous silicate, magnesium aluminate, magnesium methasilicate aluminate, synthetic aluminum silicate, calcium carbonate, sodium acid carbonate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, and the like may be used as excipients; magnesium stearate, talc, hardened oil and the like may be used as smoothing agents; coconut oil, olive oil, sesame oil, peanut oil, soya may be used as suspension agents or lubricants; cellulose acetate phthalate as a derivative of a carbohydrate such as cellulose or sugar, or methylacetate-methacrylate copolymer as a derivative of polyvinyl may be used as suspension agents; and plasticizers such as ester phthalates and the like may be used as suspension agents. In addition to the foregoing preferred ingredients, sweeteners, fragrances, colorants, preservatives and the like may be added to the administered formulation of the compound produced by the method, particularly when the compound is to be administered orally.\n\n\nThe cell cycle inhibitors, the antitumor agents, and the antifungal agents that may be produced by the method may be orally or non-orally administered to a human patient in the amount of about 0.001 mg/kg/day to about 10,000 mg/kg/day of the active ingredient, and more preferably about 0.1 mg/kg/day to about 100 mg/kg/day of the active ingredient at, preferably, once every three days on a cyclic basis, once every other day, one time per day, twice per day, or less preferably, over two to about ten times per day. Alternatively and also preferably, the compound produced by the method may preferably be administered in the stated amounts continuously by, for example, an intravenous drip. Thus, for the example of a patient weighing 70 kilograms, the preferred daily dose of the active anti-tumor ingredient would be about 0.07 mg/day to about 700 grams/day, and more preferable, 7 mg/day to about 7 grams/day. Nonetheless, as will be understood by those of skill in the art, in certain situations it may be necessary to administer the anti-tumor compound produced by the method in amounts that excess, or even far exceed, the above-stated, preferred dosage range to effectively and aggressively treat particularly advanced or lethal tumors.\n\n\nIn the case of using the cell cycle inhibitor produced by methods as a biochemical test reagent, the compound produced by methods of the invention inhibits the progression of the cell cycle when it is dissolved in an organic solvent or hydrous organic solvent and it is directly applied to any of various cultured cell systems. Usable organic solvents include, for example, methanol, methylsulfoxide, and the like. The formulation can, for example, be a powder, granular or other solid inhibitor, or a liquid inhibitor prepared using an organic solvent or a hydrous organic solvent. While a preferred concentration of the compound produced by the method of the invention for use as a cell cycle inhibitor is generally in the range of about 1 to about 100 μg/ml, the most appropriate use amount varies depending on the type of cultured cell system and the purpose of use, as will be appreciated by persons of ordinary skill in the art. Also, in certain applications it may be necessary or preferred to persons of ordinary skill in the art to use an amount outside the foregoing range.\n\n\nFrom a pharmaceutical perspective, certain embodiments provide methods for preventing or treating fungal infections and/or a pathogenic fungus in a subject, involve administering to the subject a composition including a dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, for example, administering the dehydrophenylahistin or its analog in an amount and manner which provides the intended antifungal effect.\n\n\nOther embodiments include the treatment or prevention of infection in a patient by a pathogenic fungus such as those listed above or referred to below.\n\n\nAnother embodiment relates to the treatment or prevention of infection in a patient by a pathogenic fungus which is resistant to one or more other antifungal agents, especially an agent other than dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, including e.g. amphotericin B or analogs or derivatives thereof (including 14(s)-hydroxyamphotericin B methyl ester, the hydrazide of amphotericin B with 1-amino-4-methylpiperazine, and other derivatives) or other polyene macrolide antibiotics, including, e.g., nystatin, candicidin, pimaricin and natamycin; flucytosine; griseofulvin; echinocandins or aureobasidins, including naturally occurring and semi-synthetic analogs; dihydrobenzo[a]napthacenequinones; nucleoside peptide antifungals including the polyoxins and nikkomycins; allylamines such as naftifine and other squalene epoxidease inhibitors; and azoles, imidazoles and triazoles such as, e.g., clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole, econazole, butoconazole, oxiconazole, terconazole, itraconazole or fluconazole and the like. For additional conventional antifungal agents and new agents under development, see e.g. Turner and Rodriguez, 1996 \nCurrent Pharmaceutical Design, \n2:209-224. Another embodiment involves the treatment or prevention of infection in a patient by a pathogenic fungus in cases in which the patient is allergic to, otherwise intolerant of, or nonresponsive to one or more other antifungal agents or in whom the use of other antifungal agents is otherwise contra-indicated. Those other antifungal agents include, among others, those antifungal agents disclosed above and elsewhere herein.\n\n\nIn the foregoing methods for treatment or prevention, a dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, is administered to the subject in an effective antifungal amount.\n\n\nOther embodiments relate to the treatment or prevention of infection by a pathogenic fungus in a patient by administration of a dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, in conjunction with the administration of one or more other antifungal agents, including for example, any of the previously mentioned agents or types of agents (e.g. in combination with treatment with amphotericin B, preferably in a lipid or liposome formulation; an azole or triazole such as fluconazole, for example; an aureobasidin; dihydrobenzo[a]napthacenequinone; or an echinocardin) as well as with a different dehydrophenylahistin or its analog.\n\n\nThe dehydrophenylahistin or its analog may be administered before, after or at the same time the other antifungal agent is administered. In certain embodiments, the combination therapy will permit the use of reduced amounts of one or both antifungal components, relative to the amount used if used alone.\n\n\nStill other embodiments relate to administration of a dehydrophenylahistin or its analog to a subject for the treatment or prevention of infection by a pathogenic fungus, where the subject is immunosuppressed or immunocompromised, e.g. as the result of genetic disorder, disease such as diabetes or HIV or other infection, chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer or other disease, or drug- or otherwise induced immunosuppression in connection with tissue or organ transplantation or the treatment of an autoimmune disorder. Where the patient is being or will be treated with an immunosuppressive agent, e.g., in connection with a tissue or organ transplantation, a dehydrophenylahistin or its analog may be co-administered with the immunosuppressive agent(s) to treat or prevent a pathogenic fungal infection.\n\n\nAnother aspect of this invention is the treatment or prevention of infection by a pathogenic fungus in a patient infected, or suspected of being infected, with HIV, by administration of an antifungal dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, in conjunction with the administration of one or more anti-HIV therapeutics (including e.g. HIV protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors or anti-viral agents). The dehydrophenylahistin or its analog may be administered before, after or at the same time as administration of the anti-HIV agent(s).\n\n\nAnother aspect of this invention is the treatment or prevention of infection by a pathogenic fungus in a patient by administration of an antifungal dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, in conjunction with the administration of one or more other antibiotic compounds, especially one or more antibacterial agents, preferably in an effective amount and regiment to treat or prevent bacterial infection. Again, the dehydrophenylahistin or its analog may be administered before, after or at the same time as administration of the other agent(s).\n\n\nPathogenic fungal infections which may be treated or prevented by the disclosed methods include, among others, Aspergillosis, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis; Blastomycosis, including profound or rapidly progressive infections and blastomycosis in the central nervous system; Candidiasis, including retrograde candidiasis of the urinary tract, e.g. in patients with kidney stones, urinary tract obstruction, renal transplantation or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus; Coccidioidomycosis, including chronic disease which does not respond well to other chemotherapy; Cryptococcosis; Histopolasmosis; Mucormycosis, including e.g. craniofacial mucormycosis and pulmonary mucormycosis; Paracoccidioidomycosis; and Sporotrichosis. It should be noted that administration of a composition comprising an antifungal amount of one or more dehydrophenylahistin or its analogs may be particularly useful for treating or preventing a pathogenic fungal infection in a mammalian subject where the fungus is resistant to one or more other antifungal therapies, or where the use of one or more other antifungal therapies is contraindicated, e.g., as mentioned above.\n\n\nAntifungal pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one antifungal dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, are also provided for use in practicing the disclosed methods. Those pharmaceutical compositions may be packaged together with an appropriate package insert containing, inter alia, directions and information relating to their antifungal use. Pharmaceutical compositions are also provided which contain one or more dehydrophenylahistin or its analog together with a second antifungal agent.\n\n\nMethods of Treating Fungal Infections\n\n\nCertain embodiments disclosed herein relate to methods for treating or preventing a pathogenic fungal infection, including for example Aspergillosis, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis; Blastomycosis, including profound or rapidly progressive infections and blastomycosis in the central nervous system; Candidiasis, including retrograde candidiasis of the urinary tract, e.g. in patients with kidney stones, urinary tract obstruction, renal transplantation or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus; Coccidioidomycosis, including chronic disease which does not respond well to other chemotherapy; Cryptococcosis; Histopolasmosis; Mucormycosis, including e.g. craniofacial mucormycosis and pulmonary mucormycosis; Paracoccidioidomycosis; and Sporotrichosis. The methods may involve administering at least one antifungal dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, as described above, to a human subject such that the fungal infection is treated or prevented. In certain embodiments the dehydrophenylahistin or its analog may be administered in conjunction with administration of one or more non-dehydrophenylahistin or its analog antifungal agents such as amphotericin B, or an imidazole or triazole agent such as those mentioned previously.\n\n\nThe pathogenic fungal infection may be topical, e.g., caused by, among other organisms, species of \nCandida, Trichophyton, Microsporum \nor \nEpidermophyton \nor mucosal, e.g., caused by \nCandida albicans \n(e.g. thrush and vaginal candidiasis). The infection may be systemic, e.g., caused by \nCandida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Coccidiodes, Paracocciciodes, Histoplasma \nor \nBlastomyces \nspp. The infection may also involve eumycotic mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis, cryptococcal meningitis or phycomycosis.\n\n\nFurther embodiments relate to methods for treating or preventing a pathogenic fungal infection selected from the group consisting of \nCandida \nspp. including \nC. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. kefyr, C. krusei \nand \nC. glabrata; Aspergillus \nspp. including \nA. fumigatus \nand \nA. flavus; Cryptococcus neoformans; Blastomyces \nspp. including \nBlastomyces dermatitidis; Pneumocystis carinii; Coccidioides immitis; Basidiobolus ranarum; Conidiobolus \nspp.; \nHistoplasma capsulatum; Rhizopus \nspp. including \nR. oryzae \nand \nR. microsporus; Cunninghamella \nspp.; \nRhizomucor \nspp.; \nParacoccidioides brasiliensis; Pseudallescheria boydii; Rhinosporidium seeberi; \nand \nSporothrix schenckii\n.

The methods may involve administering to the patient one or more antifungal dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, in an amount and dosing regimen such that a fungal infection resistant to another antifungal therapy in the subject is treated or prevented.\n\n\nFurther embodiments relate to methods for treating or preventing a pathogenic fungal infection in a patient who is allergic to, intolerant of or not responsive to another antifungal therapy or in whom the use of other antifungal agents is otherwise contra-indicated, including one or more other antifungal agents mentioned elsewhere herein such as amphotericin B, flucytosine, one of the imidazoles or triazoles (including e.g. fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole and the other previously mentioned examples). The methods may involve administering to such patient one or more antifungal dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, in an amount such that a fungal infection is treated or prevented.\n\n\nPackaged Dehydrophenylahistin or its Analogs\n\n\nCertain embodiments relate to packaged dehydrophenylahistin or its analogs, preferably packaged nonimmunosuppressive antifungal dehydrophenylahistin or its analogs, which term is intended to include at least one dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, as described above, packaged with instructions for administering the dehydrophenylahistin or its analog(s) as an antifungal agent without causing a untoward immunosuppressive effects within a human subject. In some embodiments, the non-immunosuppressive antifungal dehydrophenylahistin or its analog is a member of one of the preferred subsets of compounds described above. The dehydrophenylahistin or its analog can be packaged alone with the instructions or can be packaged with another dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, rapamycin or another ingredient or additive, e.g., one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions. The package can contain one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions. Optionally associated with such container(s) can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceutical or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.\n\n\nThe following non-limiting examples are meant to describe the preferred methods using certain preferred embodiments. Variations in the details of the particular methods employed and in the precise chemical compositions obtained will undoubtedly be appreciated by those of skill in the art.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\nA. Synthesis of Dehydrophenylahistin\n\n\nDehydrophenylahistin was synthesized by condensation according to the following basic reaction scheme, as shown in \nFIG. 1\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN,N′-diacetyl-2,5-piperazinedione\n\n\n25.0 g of global 2,5-piperazinedione 1 [2,5-piperazinedione (Aldrich G640-6), 25.0 g, 0.218 mol) in 100 mL of acetic anhydride (Ac\n2\nO) was mixed with sodium acetate (NaOAc) (17.96 g, 0.0218 mol). The mixture was heated at 110° C. for 8 h using a double coiled condenser under an Ar atmosphere. After Ac\n2\nO was removed by evaporation, the residue was dissolved in AcOEt, washed with 10% citric acid, 10% NaHCO\n3 \nand saturated NaCl (three times each), dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4\n, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was triturated with ether to form a solid. This solid was recrystallized from EtOAc with ether-hexane to afford 26.4 g (61%) of N,N′-diacetyl-2,5-\npiperazinedione\n 1.\n\n\n1-Acetyl-3-{(Z)-1-[5-(1,1-dimethyl-2-propenyl)-1H-4-imidazolyl]methylidene}]-2,5-\npiperazinedione\n 2\n\n\nTo a solution of 5-(1,1-dimethyl-2-propenyl)imidazole-4-carboxaldehyde (100 mg, 0.609 mmol) in DMF (2 mL) was added compound 1 (241 mg, 1.22 mmol) and the solution was repeatedly evacuated in a short time to remove oxygen and flushed with Ar, followed by the addition of Cs\n2\nCO\n3 \n(198 mg, 0.609 mmol) and the evacuation-flushing process was repeated again.

The resultant mixture was heated for 2.5 h at 80° C. (The temperature must be increased slowly. Rapid heating increases the production of E-isomer at the benzylidene moiety.) After the solvent was removed by evaporation, the residue was dissolved in EtOAc, washed with water for two times and saturated NaCl for three times, dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4 \nand concentrated in vacuo. On TLC using CHCl\n3\n-MeOH (10:1), you can observe a spot with bright green-yellow luminescence at 365 nm UV. The purity of this crude product was more than 75% from HPLC analysis. The resulting residue was dissolved in 90% MeOH aq and applied to reverse-phase HPLC column (YMC-Pack, ODS-AM, 20×250 mm) and eluted using a linear gradient from 70 to 74% MeOH in water over 16 min at a flow rate of 12 mL/min, and the desired fraction was collected and concentrated by evaporation to give a 19.7 mg (60%) of yellow colored dehydrophenylahistin. The HPLC profile of the synthetic crude dehydrophenylahistin is depicted in \nFIG. 2\n.\n\n\nIn the purification of dehydrophenylahistin, as shown in \nFIG. 4\n, a major peak was the desired Z-form compound of dehydrophenylahistin. The formation of an E-isomer was observed as a minor component (about 10%), which was eluted as a more polar peak than Z-isomer. As other minor peaks, the reduced Z- and E-compounds, in which the dimethylallyl part of dehydrophenylahistin was reduced, was also observed. The formation of these reduced compounds was due to the \naldehyde\n 2 with a reduced impurity, which was generated during the reduction of with DIBAL-H and was not separated in the subsequent process.\n\n\nThese minor compounds could be removed by preparative HPLC purification, afforded dehydrophenylahistin with the Z-configuration at the benzylidene part in a 60% yield (20% yield in two steps) with more than 95% purity. The compounds with E-configuration at the imidazole side of the diketopiperazine ring was not observed in this HPLC chart, suggesting that the first reaction from \ncompound\n 1 to 3 in \nFIG. 1\n is Z-selective.\n\n\nB.

In the synthesis of the additional tBu-dehydrophenylahistin derivatives, modifications to the \nbenzaldehyde compound\n 4 were made.\n\n\n \nFIG. 4\n illustrates the similarities of the HPLC profiles (Column: YMC-Pack ODS-AM (20×250 mm); Gradient: 65% to 75% in a methanol-water system for 20 min, then 10 min in a 100% methanol system; Flow rate: 12 mL/min; O.D. 230 nm) from the synthesized dehydrophenylahistin of Example 1 (\nFIG. 2\n) and the above exemplified tBu-dehydrophenylahistin compound produced by Route A.\n\n\nThe sequence of introduction of the aldehydes is a relevant to the yield and is therefore aspect of the synthesis. An analogue of dehydrophenylahistin was synthesized, as a control or model, wherein the dimethylallyl group was changed to the tert-butyl group with a similar steric hindrance at the 5-position of the imidazole ring.\n\n\nThe synthesis of this “tert-butyl (tBu)-dehydrophenylahistin” using “Route A” was as shown above: Particularly, the sequence of introduction of the aldehyde exactly follows the dehydrophenylahistin synthesis, and exhibited a total yield of 16.5% tBu-dehydrophenylahistin. This yield was similar to that of dehydrophenylahistin (20%). Using “Route B”, where the sequence of introduction of the aldehydes is opposite that of Route “A” for the dehydrophenylahistin synthesis, only a trace amount of the desired tBu-dehydroPLH was obtained with a total yield of 0.9%, although in the introduction of \nfirst benzaldehyde\n 4 gave a 76% yield of the \nintermediate compound\n 17. This result indicated that it may be difficult to introduce the highly bulky imidazole-4-\ncarboxaldehydes\n 15 with a substituting group having a quaternary-carbon on the adjacent 5-position at the imidazole ring into the \nintermediate compound\n 17, suggesting that the sequence for introduction of aldehydes is an important aspect for obtaining a high yield of dehydrophenylahistin or an analog of dehydrophenylahistin employing the synthesis disclosed herein.\n\n\nFrom the HPLC analysis of the final crude products, as shown in \nFIG. 4\n, a very high content of tBu-dehydrophenylahistin and small amount of by-product formations were observed in the crude sample of Route A (left). However, a relatively smaller amount of the desired tBu-dehydrophenylahistin and several other by-products were observed in the sample obtained using Route B (right).\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\nAlternative, Larger-Scale Synthesis of Dehydrophenylahistin and Analogs\n\n\nSynthesis of 3-Z-Benzylidene-6-[5″-(1,1-dimethylallyl)-1H-imidazol-4″-Z-ylmethylene]-piperazine-2,5-dione [Dehydrophenylahistin] (1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3-Hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-butyric acid methyl ester\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA solution of LDA in heptane/THF/ethylbenzene (2 M, 196 ml, 0.39 mol) was added under argon to a solution of methyl isobutyrate (45 ml, 0.39 mol) in THF (270 ml) at −60° and the resultant mixture was stirred for 30 min.

The removal of oxygen is preferred because such removal is believed to decrease oxidation of alpha-carbon at the position 6 of the diketopiperazine ring. The resultant mixture was stirred for 5 h at room temperature. After the solvent was removed by evaporation, the residue was dissolved in the mixture of EtOAc and 10% Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, and the organic phase was washed with 10% Na\n2\nCO\n3 \nagain and saturated NaCl for three times, dried over Na\n2\nCO\n3 \nand concentrated in vacuo. The residual oil was purified by column chromatography on silica using CHCl\n3\n-MeOH (100:0 to 50:1) as an eluant to give 60 mg (33%) of a pale yellow solid 2.\n\n\nDehydrophenylahistin\n\n\nTo a solution of 2 (30 mg, 0.099 mmol) in DMF (0.8 mL) was added benzaldehyde (51 μL, 0.496 mmol, 5 eq) and the solution was repeatedly evacuated in a short time to remove oxygen and flushed with Ar, followed by the addition of Cs\n2\nCO\n3 \n(53 mg, 0.149 mmol, 1.5 eq) and the evacuation-flushing process was repeated again. The resultant mixture was heated for 2.5 h at 80° C. (The temperature must be increased slowly. Rapid heating increases the production of E-isomer at the benzylidene moiety.) After the solvent was removed by evaporation, the residue was dissolved in EtOAc, washed with water for two times and saturated NaCl for three times, dried over Na\n2\nSO\n4 \nand concentrated in vacuo. On TLC using CHCl\n3\n-MeOH (10:1), you can observe a spot with bright green-yellow luminescence at 365 nm UV. The purity of this crude product was more than 75% from HPLC analysis. The resulting residue was dissolved in 90% MeOH aq and applied to reverse-phase HPLC column (YMC-Pack, ODS-AM, 20×250 mm) and eluted using a linear gradient from 70 to 74% MeOH in water over 16 min at a flow rate of 12 mL/min, and the desired fraction was collected and concentrated by evaporation to give a 19.7 mg (60%), although the yields are not optimized for each step, of yellow colored dehydrophenylahistin.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\nBiological Characteristics of Dehydrophenylahistin and Dehydrophenylahistin Analogs\n\n\nA. Biological Evaluation\n\n\nThe biological characteristics of synthesized tBu-dehydrophenylahistin and dehydrophenylahistin were evaluated in both HT29 human colon cells, and PC-3 prostatic adenocarcinoma cells.\n\n\nHT-29 (ATCC HTB-38) a human colorectal adenocarcinoma was maintained in McCoy's complete medium (McCoy's 5A medium with L-glutamine and 25 mM HEPES supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM Na pyruvate, 1×NEAA, 2 mM L-glutamine, and Pen/Strep at 100 IU/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively). PC-3 (ATCC CRL-1435), a human prostate adenocarcinoma, was maintained in F12K complete medium (F12K medium supplemented with 10% FBS; 2 mM Glutamine; 1% HEPES; and Pen/Strep at 100 IU/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively). Cell lines were cultured at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nin a 95% humidified incubator.\n\n\nFor tumor cytotoxicity assays HT-29 or PC-3 cells were seeded at 5,000 cells/well in 90 μl complete media into a Corning 3904 black-walled, clear-bottom tissue culture plate and the plate were incubated overnight to allow cells to establish and enter log phase growth. 20 mM stock solutions of dehydrophenylahistin and tBu-dehydrophenylahistin were prepared in 100% DMSO and stored at −20° C. 10× concentrated serial dilutions of the two compounds were prepared in appropriate culture medium for final concentrations ranging from 20×10\n−5 \nM to 20×10\n−10 \nM. Ten μl volumes of the 10× serial dilutions were added to the test wells in triplicate and the plates returned to the incubator for 48 hours. The final concentration of DMSO was 0.25% in all samples.\n\n\nFollowing 48 hours of \ndrug exposure\n 10 μl of 0.2 mg/ml resazurin (obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) in Mg\n2+\n, Ca\n2+\n free PBS was added to each well and the plates were returned to the incubator for 3-4 hours. The plates were removed and resazurin fluorescence was measured using 530 nm excitation and 590 nm emission filters in a Fusion fluorimeter (Packard Instruments). Resazurin dye without cells was used to determine the background, which was subtracted from the data for all experimental wells. The data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad Software). The data were normalized to the average of the cells treated with media only (100% cell growth) and EC\n50 \nvalues were determined using a standard sigmoidal dose response curve fitting algorithm.\n\n\nAs indicated in Table 1 below, tBu-dehydrophenylahistin demonstrates about a 4-times greater cytotoxic activity in comparison with dehydrophenylahistin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCytotoxic Effect of dehydrophenylahistin and derivative.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEC\n50 \n(nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncell\n \nΔPLH\n \ntBu-ΔPLH\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHT29\n \n48\n \n13\n \n \n \nPC-3\n \n5.4\n \n1.0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nB.

Evaluation of Dehydrophenylahistin Derivatives\n\n\nEvaluation of derivatives described above are assessed according to the methods described in Example 3. Additional evaluation of the derivatives are extended to specific activities such as determining the inhibiting effect on cell proliferation, the effects on a specific cellular mechanism (i.e. microtubule function), effects on cell cycle progression, evaluating in vitro anti-tumor activity against cancer cell lines, etc. Some evaluation method protocols are given below.\n\n\n1) Cell Proliferation Inhibiting Effect of Dehydrophenylahistin And Its Analogs\n\n\nInto each well of a 96-well microtiter plate, 100 μl of A-549 cells derived from human lung cancer prepared to 10\n5 \ncells/ml in a culture medium obtained by adding 10% bovine fetus serum to EMEM culture medium (Nissui Seiyaku Co., Ltd.) having antitumor effect against A-549 cells derived from human lung cancer are placed. Methanol solution of the derivative obtained by the above-listed examples are added to the wells of the uppermost row, specimens are diluted by the half-log dilution method and added, and the plate is incubated in a carbon dioxide gas incubator at 37° C. for 48 hours. The result is added in lots of 10 μl with MTT reagent (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazole)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetra bromide)(1 mg/ml•PBS), followed by incubation in a carbon dioxide gas incubator at 37° C. for 6 hours. The culture medium is discarded and the crystal of produced in the cells are dissolved in 100 μl/well of dimethylsulfoxide. Absorption of 595 nm light is then measured with a microplate reader. By comparing the light absorptions of the untreated cells to that of cells treated with a specimen of a known concentration, the specimen concentration that inhibited \ncell proliferation\n 50% (IC\n50\n) is calculated.\n\n\n2) Cell Cycle Inhibiting Activity of Dehydrophenylahistin And Its Analogs\n\n\nCell strain A431 is derived from human lung cancer. EMEM culture medium containing 10% bovine fetal serum and 1% MEM nonessential amino acid solution (SIGMA M2025) is used to incubate A431 cells at 37° C. in an incubator saturated with 5% carbon dioxide gas and water vapor. The refined specimen of dehydrophenylahistin obtained in by the methods above are added to the cells in the log-growth phase and progression of the cell cycle is analyzed by flow cytometer and microscopic observation.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 6\n\n\nStructure-Activity Relationship of Synthesized Dehydrophenylahistin (DehydroPLH) Derivatives\n\n\n1) Overview in Derivative Syntheses\n\n\nMany, but not all, of the derivatives of dehydroPLH disclosed herein include one, two, or three modifications at the phenyl ring (\nFIG. 5\n below). The derivatives were synthesized by the methods described above. As shown in Table 5, certain compounds showed more potent cytotoxic activity than dehydroPLH and tBu-dehydroPLH. The most potent compound exhibiting an EC\n50 \nvalue of 3 nM was KPU-90. This value was 16-times and 4-times higher than that of dehydroPLH and tBu-dehydroPLH, respectively. These derivatives have mono-substitution at the o- or m-position of the phenyl ring with the halogen atoms such as fluorine and chlorine atoms or the methyl, vinyl or methoxy group. Derivatives with substitutions to heteroaryl structures such as the npahthalene, thiophene and furan rings also elicited a potent activity. KPU-35, 42, 69, 80 and 81 also showed higher activity than tBu-dehydroPLH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthetic potent dehydroPLH derivatives\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nStructure\n\n\nEC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntBu-ΔPLH (KPU-2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-81\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDehydroPL H(KPU-1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Introduction of the Methoxy Groups to the Phenyl Ring\n\n\nColchicine recognizes the same binding site on 13-tubulin as PLH.

Nonetheless, it is appreciated that persons of skill in the art may interpret the results presented herein to suggest that a relatively smaller functional group, affecting less steric hindrance, may be preferred to elicit more potent activity, and slightly large groups such as the ethoxy group (when compared to the methoxy group) or the Br atom (when compared to the Cl atom) may affect steric hindrance unfavorable to interaction with, for example, the tubulin binding site. Moreover, because the electrical property of these substituents did not affect the activity, it is suggested that these relatively small substituents do not directly interact with the binding site of 13-tubulin, but restrict the conformation of dehydroPLH suitable for the binding. Or, as another possible hypothesis, the hydrophobic property may be a more important factor at the binding site for o- or m-position on β-tubulin, since introduction of the hydrophilic hydroxyl group, which can form the hydrogen bonding as a hydrogen-donor, drastically decreased the activity.\n\n\nAs shown in Table 9, the effect of the substituents in the cytotoxic activity at the o-position may be ordered, as in the case of m-position, as shown in Table 10. The compounds having effective functional groups, which showed higher activity than tBu-dehydroPLH, may also be further modified. And since the migration of the stereochemistry from Z to E under the visible light irradiation was observed, substituents that decrease the electron density in the conjugated double bonds may contribute to the reduction of Z to E migration by the light, results in more physicochemically stable structures. Temperature can also effect this migration.\n\n\nModification at two parts of the ring can be preferred for the development of potent but also biologically stable compounds. The phenyl ring of phenylahistin is oxidized by cytochrome P-450. Double modification that reduce the electron density of the phenyl ring may therefore be effective to avoid P-450 oxidation. Thus, the combination of the small electron withdrawing group such as the fluorine atom to the element that can increase the activity such as —OMe, -Me, —Cl, —F and Br, may result in more potent and biologically stable drug compounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of modification at the o-position\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nStructure\n\n\nEC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>20 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of modification at the m-position\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nStructure\n\n\nEC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n617\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4) Substitution of the Phenyl Ring to Aryl-Heterocycles\n\n\nThe phenyl ring may also be replaced by heteroaryl groups. The result of such replacements in terms of the cytotoxic activity are shown in Table 11. Since the arylic nitrogen atoms can form a hydrogen bonding with a NH group of the diketopiperazine ring and restrict the conformation of the molecule between pyridine and diketopiperazine rings to an uniplanar structure, the active conformation of dehydroPLH would be required a certain level of dihedral angle formed by the steric repulsion between an amide hydrogen atom of the diketopiperazine ring and an o-hydrogen atom of the phenyl ring (\nFIG. 6\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of the replacement with the heteroaryl ring on proliferation of HT-29 cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nStructure\n\n\nEC\n50 \n(nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>20 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n544\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>20 μM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-60\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n184\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2790\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKPU-63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n105\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplacing the phenyl ring with a smaller furan or thiophene ring, for example, KPU-29 or -42, exhibited activity. The phenyl ring can be changed to other aromatic structure while maintaining the potent activity.\n\n\n5) Metabolism of Phenylahistin\n\n\nIn the recent his study, (±)-phenylahistin was treated with rat hepatic microsome or human hepatic P450s. In human case at least seven metabolites were detected, and two of them, i.e., P1 and P3, were major metabolites, represented more than 60% of the recovered metabolites.\n\n\nSince there is no exo-olefin structure in tBu-dehydroPLH, present synthesized derivatives have no oxidization like P1 and P4. However, oxidizations such as P3 and P5 are formed during the hepatic metabolism. Various derivatives, which prevent such metabolism, are effective to avoid P450 oxidization at the phenyl ring. The imidazole ring can also be modified to avoid the unfavorable oxidation.\n\n\n6) Physicochemical Stability of dehydroPLH\n\n\nThe physicochemical stability is one of the unfavorable problems of dehydroPLH. In phenylahistin, since there is no additional olefin structure at the benzyl part, there is no such problem. However, in dehydroPLH, the benzylidene moiety can be easily activated, probably with the visible light, and the Z to E migration frequently occurs due to the existence of longer conjugation of the double bond. This migration occurred even under normal room light. In the cytotoxic assay, some of the compounds migrate to E-form during the incubation, although this migration probably equilibrates at the 1:1 ratio in the case of dehydroPLH. This migration can be controlled. The Z to E migration is also known in combretastatin A4, a same type of tubulin inhibitor, and a few studies for improving this problem were reported.\n\n\n7) Prodrug Synthesis\n\n\nThe E-form may also be used as a prodrug of dehydroPLH or of one or more of its analogs, including those analogs described herein. One of the undesired properties of anti-tubulin drugs involves its low selectivity between tumor and intact tissues, although these drugs belong to one of the molecular target therapies. This causes undesired side effects. However, if the compounds functions selectively only in tumor tissues, negative side effects of anti-microtubule drugs can be reduced. Since the dehydroPLH (Z-form) can be produced from its E-isomer by visible light irradiation, the E-form is administered and photo irradiation is performed only at the tumor site, then only the tumor is damaged by photo-produced Z-form and the adverse effect to the intact tissues is reduced.\n\n\nThe E-form can be protected chemically by the addition of a bulky but biodegradable acyl group, which is introduced into the diketopiperazine ring as a prodrug. This acyl group can be cleaved by the protease in the body. Therefore, the acylated-E-compound is maintained before administration, then after administration it is changed to the real E-form, which can migrate to the bioactive Z-form by the local photo irradiation.\n\n\nThe synthetic scheme of this acyl-E-form of tBu-dehydroPLH is summarized in \nFIG. 9\n.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 7\n\n\nPharmaceutical Formulations of the Synthesized Dehydrophenylahistins\n\n\n1) Formulations Administered Intravenously, by Drip, Injection, Infusion or The Like\n\n\nVials containing 5 g of powdered glucose are each added aseptically with 10 mg of a compound synthesized by the method and sealed. After being charged with nitrogen, helium or other inert gas, the vials are stored in a cool, dark place. Before use, the contents are dissolved in ethanol and added to 100 ml of a 0.85% physiological salt water solution. The resultant solution is administered as a method of inhibiting the growth of a cancerous tumor in a human diagnosed as having such a tumor at between approximately 10 ml/day to approximately 1000 ml/day, intravenously, by drip, or via a subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection, as deemed appropriate by those of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n2) Formulation to be Administered Orally Or The Like\n\n\nA mixture obtained by thoroughly blending 1 g of a compound synthesized by the method, 98 g of lactose and 1 g of hydroxypropyl cellulose is formed into granules by any conventional method. The granules are thoroughly dried and sifted to obtain a granule preparation suitable for packaging in bottles or by heat sealing. The resultant granule preparations are orally administered at between approximately 100 ml/day to approximately 1000 ml/day, depending on the symptoms, as deemed appropriate by those of ordinary skill in the art of treating cancerous tumors in humans.\n\n\n3) Formulation to be Administered Topically\n\n\nAdministration to an individual of an effective amount of the compound can also be accomplished topically by administering the compound(s) directly to the affected area of the skin of the individual. For this purpose, the compound administered or applied is in the form of a composition including a pharmacologically acceptable topical carrier, such as a gel, an ointment, a lotion, or a cream, which includes, without limitation, such carriers as water, glycerol, alcohol, propylene glycol, fatty alcohols, triglycerides, fatty acid esters, or mineral oils. Other topical carriers include liquid petroleum, isopropyl palmitate, polyethylene glycol, ethanol (95%), polyoxyethylene monolaurate (5%) in water, or sodium lauryl sulfate (5%) in water. Other materials such as anti-oxidants, humectants, viscosity stabilizers, and similar agents may be added as necessary. Percutaneous penetration enhancers such as Azone may also be included. In addition, in certain instances, it is expected that the compound may be disposed within devices placed upon, in, or under the skin. Such devices include patches, implants, and injections which release the compound into the skin, by either passive or active release mechanisms.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 8\n\n\nIn vitro Pharmacology of KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl phenylahistin\n\n\nThe in vitro efficacy studies performed with KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl phenylahistin included: A) a panel of six tumor cell lines, B) studies in multidrug-resistant tumor cells, and C) studies to determine the mechanism of action.\n\n\nA). Study of KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl Phenylahistin in a Panel of Six Tumor Cell Lines\n\n\nThe following cell lines (source in parentheses) were used: HT29 (human colon tumor; ATCC; HTB-38), PC3 (human prostate tumor; ATCC; CRL-1435), MDA-MB-231 (human breast tumor; ATCC; HTB-26), NCI-H292 (human non-small cell lung tumor; ATCC; CRL-1848), OVCAR-3 (human ovarian tumor; ATCC; HTB-161), B16-F10 (murine melanoma; ATCC; CRL-6475) and CCD-27sk (normal human fibroblast; ATCC; CRL-1475). Cells were maintained at subconfluent densities in their respective culture media.\n\n\nCytotoxicity assays were performed as described above in Example 4, using Resazurin fluorescence as an indicator of cell viability.\n\n\nThe disclosed compounds are effective agents against a variety of different and distinct tumor cell lines. Specifically, for example, KPU-2 and KPU-35 were most effective on the HT-29 tumor cell line, both in terms of potency (active in the low nanomolar range) and efficacy (most responsive in terms of the maximum cytotoxic effect); t-butyl-phenylahistin exhibited its greatest potency against the PC-3 tumor cell line, although the greatest efficacy was displayed against the HT-29 cell line; KPU-2 and KPU-35 were generally 10-40 fold more potent than t-butyl-phenylahistin whereas the efficacy was similar for all three compounds in the different tumor cell lines; the HT-29, PC-3, MDA-MB-231 and NCI-H292 tumor cell lines all responded similarly to the NPI compounds, whereas the B16-F10 appeared to be somewhat less sensitive. t-butyl-phenylahistin displayed a marked differential between normal fibroblasts and the tumor cell lines, with a ratio ranging from >20->100, except for the OVCAR-3 cell line.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 12\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nActivity of KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl phenylahistin in the Tumor Panel Screen\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKPU-2\n \nKPU-35\n \nt-butyl-phenylahistin\n \n \n \n \n \nCell Line\n \nMean\n \nSD\n \nn\n \nMean\n \nSD\n \nn\n \nMean\n \nSD\n \nn\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHT-29 Colon\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIC50 nM\n \n9.8\n \n2.4\n \n4\n \n8.2\n \n2.0\n \n4\n \n420\n \n473\n \n3\n \n \n \n% Cytotoxicity\n \n82.5\n \n5.3\n \n4\n \n81.3\n \n4.0\n \n4\n \n88\n \n0.2\n \n3\n \n \n \nPC-3 Prostate\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIC50 nM\n \n13.4\n \n0.7\n \n4\n \n13.2\n \n2.5\n \n4\n \n174\n \n—\n \n2\n \n \n \n% Cytotoxicity\n \n60.3\n \n2.1\n \n4\n \n56.8\n \n1.0\n \n4\n \n59.5\n \n—\n \n2\n \n \n \nMDA-MB-231\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBreast\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIC50 nM\n \n13.8\n \n1.9\n \n3\n \n9.7\n \n4.2\n \n4\n \n387\n \n—\n \n2\n \n \n \n% Cytotoxicity\n \n56.7\n \n7.2\n \n3\n \n59.3\n \n5.6\n \n4\n \n65.5\n \n—\n \n2\n \n \n \nNCI-H292 Lung\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIC50 nM\n \n17.5\n \n1.1\n \n4\n \n15.9\n \n1.1\n \n4\n \n384\n \n194\n \n3\n \n \n \n% Cytotoxicity\n \n70.5\n \n2.9\n \n4\n \n68.5\n \n2.9\n \n4\n \n65\n \n5\n \n3\n \n \n \nOVCAR-3 Ovary\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIC50 nM\n \n>20,000\n \n—\n \n4\n \n>20,000\n \n—\n \n4\n \n>20,000\n \n—\n \n2\n \n \n \n% Cytotoxicity\n \n45.8\n \n3.0\n \n4\n \n39\n \n2.2\n \n4\n \n37\n \n—\n \n2\n \n \n \nB16-F10 Melanoma\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIC50 nM\n \n37.1\n \n26.3\n \n4\n \n32.3\n \n19.9\n \n4\n \n736\n \n650\n \n3\n \n \n \n% Cytotoxicity\n \n71.8\n \n2.5\n \n4\n \n72.0\n \n2.2\n \n4\n \n74\n \n2\n \n3\n \n \n \nCCD-27sk\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFibroblast\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIC50 nM\n \n9.2\n \n2.9\n \n4\n \n7.4\n \n2.6\n \n4\n \n>20,000\n \n—\n \n2\n \n \n \n% Cytotoxicity\n \n64.3\n \n2.4\n \n4\n \n60.8\n \n1.9\n \n4\n \n45\n \n—\n \n2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nB). Studies in Drug Resistant Cell Lines\n\n\n\nOne of the major challenges in the use of chemotherapeutic agents in clinical oncology is the development of resistance to the drug effect by the tumor cells. There are several mechanisms for the development of resistance, each of which will have differential effects on chemotherapeutic drugs. These mechanisms include increased expression of ATP-dependent efflux pumps such as the P-glycoprotein encoded by MDR1 or the multidrug-resistance associated \nprotein\n 1 encoded by MRP1. Reduced drug uptake, alteration of the drug's target, increasing repair of drug-induced DNA damage, alteration of the apoptotic pathway and the activation of cytochrome P450 enzymes are other examples of mechanisms by which cancer cells become resistant to anticancer drugs. The selected compounds were studied in three different cell lines that exhibit two different mechanisms of resistance; the overexpression of the P-glycoprotein and altered topoisomerase II activity.\n\n\n1) Human Uterine Sarcoma Tumor Cell Line Pair: MES-SA (Taxol Sensitive) and MES-SA DX (Taxol Resistant).\n\n\nThis cell line expresses elevated mdr-1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein (an extrusion pump mechanism). Pretreatment with cyclosporin-A (CsA) blocks P-glycoprotein and reinstates activity in the resistant cell line for those compounds for which the resistance is due to elevated P-glycoprotein.\n\n\nAs can be seen from Table 13, KPU-2, and KPU-35 have the same potency in the resistant cell line as in the sensitive line and the potency of t-butyl-phenylahistin was only slightly reduced. Cyclosporin A (CsA) pretreatment did not alter the potency of the selected compounds. In contrast, taxol was virtually inactive in the MES-SA DX resistant cell line, whereas this compound was very potent in the sensitive cell line. CsA treatment restored the sensitivity to taxol of the MES-SA DX cell line. The MES-SA DX cell line also showed reduced susceptibility to etoposide (60 fold), doxorubicin (34 fold) and mitoxantrone (20 fold).\n\n\nThese data indicate that the effects of KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin are not susceptible to the taxol-related resistance mechanism (p-glycoprotein) in this cell line, and that cross-resistance from taxol does not occur to these selected compounds in this model.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 13\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nActivity of KPU-2, KPU-35, t-butyl-phenylahistin and Taxol in MES-SA\n \n \n \nTaxol Sensitive and MES-SA DX Taxol Resistant Human Uterine Sarcoma\n \n \n \nTumor Cell Lines\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMES-SA Sensitive\n \nMES-SA DX Resistant\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNo CsA\n \nCsA Pretreat\n \nNo CsA\n \nCsA Pretreat\n \n \n \n \n \nCompound\n \nIC50\n \nIC50\n \nRatio No\n \nIC50\n \nRatio\n \nIC50\n \nRatio No\n \n \n \nStudy\n \nnM\n \nnM\n \nCsA\n \nnM\n \nMES-SA\n \nnM\n \nCsA\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKPU-2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStudy I\n \n8.5\n \n—\n \n—\n \n10.5\n \n1.2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n \n \nStudy II\n \n19.4\n \n27.4\n \n1.4\n \n21.7\n \n1.1\n \n37.8\n \n1.74\n \n \n \nKPU-35\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStudy I\n \n6.6\n \n—\n \n \n \n5.2\n \n0.8\n \n—\n \n—\n \n \n \nStudy III\n \n3.9\n \n2.0\n \n0.5\n \n2.5\n \n0.6\n \n6.7\n \n2.7\n \n \n \nt-butyl-\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nphenylahistin\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStudy I\n \n144\n \n—\n \n—\n \n825\n \n5.7\n \n—\n \n—\n \n \n \nStudy III\n \n122\n \n162\n \n1.3\n \n694\n \n4.3\n \n622\n \n0.9\n \n \n \nTaxol\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStudy I\n \n4.4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n>20,000\n \n>455\n \n—\n \n—\n \n \n \nStudy II\n \n13.3\n \n7.6\n \n0.6\n \n>>100\n \n>>8\n \n40\n \n<<0.25\n \n \n \nStudy III\n \n7.3\n \n2.8\n \n0.4\n \n>24,000\n \n>3000\n \n2.0\n \n<<0.001\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n2) Human Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Cell Line Pair: HL-60 (Mitoxantrone-Sensitive) and HL-60/MX-2 (Mitoxantrone-Resistant)\n\n\n\nThis cell line is considered to have atypical drug resistance properties with altered topoisomerase II catalytic activity without overexpression of P-glycoprotein.\n\n\nAs can be seen in Table 14, these results indicate that the potencies of the selected novel compounds are very similar in the sensitive and resistant HL-60 cell lines. In contrast, Mitoxantrone loses efficacy by a factor of 24-fold in the resistant HL-60/MX-2 cell line.\n\n\nThus, KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin are not susceptible to the same resistance mechanisms as Mitoxantrone in this cell line, and there is no cross-resistance from Mitoxantrone to these selected novel compounds in this model.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 14\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nActivity of KPU-2, KPU-35, t-butyl-phenylahistin and Mitoxantrone\n \n \n \nin the HL-60 Human Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia Tumor\n \n \n \nSensitive and Resistant Cell Line Pair\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHL-60 Resistant\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHL-60 Sensitive\n \n \n \nRatio\n \n \n \nCompound\n \nIC50 nM\n \nIC50 nM\n \nto Sensitive\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKPU-2\n \n6.4\n \n8.17\n \n1.28\n \n \n \nKPU-35\n \n9.2\n \n7.3\n \n0.79\n \n \n \nt-butyl-phenylahistin\n \n255\n \n175\n \n0.69\n \n \n \nMitoxantrone\n \n202\n \n4870\n \n24.1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3). Human Breast Carcinoma Cell Line Pair: MCF-7 (Taxol Sensitive) and MCF-7/ADR (Taxol Resistant)\n\n\n\nThis study involved KPU-2 in comparison to taxol. KPU-2 demonstrated similar potencies in both the sensitive and resistant members of this cell line pair. In contrast, taxol was virtually inactive in the resistant cell line whereas there was low nanomolar potency in the sensitive cell line (Table 15).\n\n\nThese studies confirm in a different human tumor cell line that taxol resistance does not transfer to KPU-2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 15\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nActivity of KPU-2 and Taxol in the MCF-7 Human Breast\n \n \n \nCarcinoma Sensitive and Resistant Cell Line Pair\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMCF-7/ADR Resistant\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMCF-7 Sensitive\n \n \n \nRatio\n \n \n \n \n \nCompound\n \n \nIC50 nM\n \n \nIC\n \n 50 nM\n \nto Sensitive\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKPU-2\n \n39.6\n \n27.4\n \n0.69\n \n \n \n \n \nTaxol\n \n2.6\n \n>>100\n \n>>38\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nC) Studies of the Mechanism of Action\n\n\n1). Action on Microtubule Function\n\n\n\nHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HuVEC from Cambrex) were used in this study, for evaluating the effects of KPU-2 and t-butyl-phenylahistin in comparison to colchicine and taxol on tubulin by staining for α-tubulin.\n\n\nThirty minutes exposure to KPU-2, t-butyl-phenylahistin or colchicine (all at 2 μM) induced microtubule depolymerization as was indicated by the lack of intact microtubule structure in contrast to that observed in the DMSO Control and cell membrane blebbing (a clear indication of apoptosis) in the HuVEC cells, whereas taxol did not induce microtubule depolymerization under these conditions. Colchicine is a known microtubule depolymerizing agent whereas taxol is a tubulin stabilizing agent. Similar results were obtained when CCD-27sk cells were exposed to KPU-2 or colchicine.\n\n\n2). Induction of Apoptosis\n\n\nApoptosis and its dysregulation play an important role in oncology; the selective induction of the programmed cell death cycle in tumor cells is the goal of many chemotherapeutic drug discovery programs. This induction of apoptosis can be demonstrated by different methods including the characteristic cell membrane blebbing, DNA fragmentation, hyperphosphorylation of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2, activation of the caspase cascade and cleavage of poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP).\n\n\nThe characteristic signs of apoptotic cell death include cell membrane blebbing, disruption of nuclei, cell shrinkage and condensation and finally cell death, very distinctive from necrotic cell death. KPU-2 induced the typical morphological changes associated with early stages of apoptosis in human prostate tumor cells. A similar finding was also clear in the treatment of HuVEC cells with KPU-2.\n\n\n3). DNA Fragmentation\n\n\nA late stage characteristic of apoptosis is internucleosomal DNA cleavage that results in a distinctive ladder pattern that can be visualized by gel electrophoresis. This approach was used to study the effect of KPU-2 on DNA laddering in Jurkat cells (human T cell leukemia line) in comparison to halimide and dehydrophenylahistin (KPU-1). KPU-2 induced DNA laddering at the 1 nM concentration whereas halimide and KPU-1 were much less potent.\n\n\n4). Activation of the Caspase Cascade\n\n\nSeveral enzymes in the caspase cascade are activated during apoptosis, including Caspase-3, -8 and -9. The activity of Caspase-3 was monitored in Jurkat cells following treatment with KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin.\n\n\nThe results indicate that caspase-3 was activated in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with all three compounds in a manner similar to halimide. The caspase-3 activation occurred over a similar concentration range as for the IC50s for cytotoxicity in the Jurkat cell line (Table 16).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 16\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCytotoxicity of KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin in Jurkat Cells\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCytotoxicity\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPotency\n \nEfficacy\n \n \n \n \n \nNPI Compound\n \nIC50 nM\n \n% Cell Death\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKPU-2\n \n11\n \n94\n \n \n \n \n \nKPU-35\n \n5\n \n93\n \n \n \n \n \nt-butyl-phenylahistin\n \n165\n \n93\n \n \n \n \n \nMitoxantrone\n \n41\n \n99\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5). Cleavage of Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) in Jurkat Cells\n\n\n\nIn order to assess the ability of these compounds to induce apoptosis in Jurkat cells, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was monitored. PARP is a 116 kDa nuclear protein that is one of the main intracellular targets of Caspase-3. The cleavage of PARP generates a stable 89 kDa product, and this process can be easily monitored by western blotting. Cleavage of PARP by caspases is one of the hallmarks of apoptosis, and as such serves as an excellent marker for this process. KPU-2 at 100 nM induced cleavage of PARP in \nJurkat cells\n 10 hours after exposure of the cells to the compound. KPU-2 appeared to be more active than either halimide or KPU-1.\n\n\n6). Enhanced Vascular Permeability in HuVEC Cells\n\n\nCompounds that depolymerize microtubules (e.g. combretastatin A-4-phosphate, ZD6126) have been shown to induce vascular collapse in tumors in vivo. This vascular collapse is preceded by a rapid induction of vascular cell permeability initially to electrolytes and soon after to large molecules. The enhanced permeability of HuVEC cells to a fluorescent-labeled dextran is used as a proxy assay for vascular collapse.\n\n\nKPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin all rapidly (within 1 hour) induced significant HuVEC monolayer permeability, to an extent similar to colchicine. The microtubule stabilizing agent taxol was inactive in this assay (\nFIG. 12\n).\n\n\n7). Profile in A Broad Kinase Screen\n\n\nKPU-2 was initially screened at a concentration of 10 μM in a panel of 60 different kinases; the ATP concentration was 10 μM. Four kinases were inhibited by greater than 50% in the primary screen and the IC50′s determined in secondary screening are presented in Table 17. All of the IC50 values are in the low micromolar range, which indicates that inhibition of these kinases is not related to the low nanomolar activities observed for tumor cell cytotoxicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity of KPU-2 against Selected Kinases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKinase\n\n\nIC50 (μM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCDK1/Cyclin B (human)\n\n\n10.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nc-RAF (human)\n\n\n8.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJNK3 (rat)\n\n\n6.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLyn (mouse)\n\n\n11.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 9\n\n\nIn Vivo Pharmacology\n\n\nPreliminary studies with KPU-2 were performed using the MX-1 (breast) and HT-29 (colon) xenograft models and the P-388 murine leukemia tumor model, in the mouse. Other tumor models selected on the basis of activity in the in vitro tumor panel were the DU-145 (prostate), MCF-7 (breast), and the A549 (lung) cell lines. The human pancreatic tumor (MiaPaCa-2) was also included. The novel compounds were studied as monotherapy and in combination with a clinically-used chemotherapeutic agent. The doses of the selected novel compounds were determined from the acute tolerability testing (Maximally Tolerated Dose, MTD) and were adjusted if necessary during each study. The doses of the clinically-used chemotherapeutic agents were selected on the basis of historical studies.\n\n\nKPU-2 was the first compound to be studied in these five tumor models. Following the initial results from this study, all three compounds were compared in the HT-29 human colon tumor, the DU-145 human prostate and the MCF-7 human breast tumor xenograft models.\n\n\nThe above models all use the subcutaneous xenograft implantation technique and are potentially subject to selective effects of a compound on the subcutaneous vasculature producing a magnified (or apparent) antitumor activity. In order to circumvent this possibility, two other tumor models have been incorporated in the research. One of these is the observation of lung metastases following the intravenous injection of B16-F10 mouse melanoma tumor cells. The other model is the implantation of MDA-231 human breast tumor cells in the mouse mammary fat pad. While this latter model is a xenograft model, the subcutaneous vasculature does not play a role.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n1). Xenograft Models\n\n\nAnimals used were (exceptions are indicated for individual studies): female nude mice (nu/nu) between 5 and 6 weeks of age (˜20 g, Harlan); group size was 9-10 mice per group unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\nCell lines used for tumor implantation were: HT-29 human colon tumor; MCF-7 human breast tumor; A549 human non small cell lung tumor; MiaPaCa-2 human pancreas tumor; DU-145 human prostate tumor.\n\n\nSelected novel compounds were administered as monotherapy via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route at the doses indicated for the individual study; for the combination studies the selected reference chemotherapy agents were injected 15-30 min prior to the compound.\n\n\nVehicles used in these studies were: 12.5% DMSO, 5% Cremaphor and 82.5% peanut oil for the selected novel compounds; (1:3) Polysorbate 80:13% ethanol for taxotere; (1:1) Cremaphor:ethanol for paclitaxel; for CPT-11 each mL of solution contained 20 mg of irinotecan hydrochloride, 45 mg of sorbitol NF powder, and 0.9 mg of lactic acid, the pH being adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH or HCl. Saline dilutions are used to achieve the injection concentrations used for the reference compounds.\n\n\nHT-29 Human Colon Tumor Model\n\n\nAnimals were implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) by trocar with fragments of HT-29 tumors harvested from s.c. growing tumors in nude mice hosts. When the tumor size reached 5 mm×5 mm (about 10-17 days) the animals were matched into treatment and control groups. Mice were weighed twice weekly and tumor measurements were obtained using calipers twice weekly, starting on \nDay\n 1. The tumor measurements were converted to estimated mg tumor weight using the formula (W\n2\n×L)/2. When the estimated tumor weight of the control group reached an average of 1000 mg the mice were weighed, sacrificed and the tumor removed. The tumors were weighed and the mean tumor weight per group was calculated and the tumor growth inhibition (TGI) was determined for each group (100% minus the change in the mean treated tumor weight/the change in the mean control tumor weight×100.\n\n\nIn this model unless otherwise noted for the individual study, the selected novel compounds were injected intraperitoneally every third day for 15 days [1, 4, 8, 11 and 15 (q3dx5)]; CPT-11 was administered intraperitoneally on \n \ndays\n \n 1, 8 and 15 (qwx3).\n\n\nMCF-7 Human Breast Tumor Model\n\n\nFemale nude mice (˜20 g) were implanted s.c. with 21-day release estrogen (0.25 mg) pellets 24 hours prior to the s.c. implantation with MCF-7 tumor fragments (harvested from s.c. tumors in nude mice hosts). The study then proceeded as described for the HT-29 model, using taxotere as the standard chemotherapy agent.\n\n\nIn this model unless otherwise noted for the individual study, the novel compounds were injected via the intraperitoneal route daily on Days 1-5, inclusive (qdx5); taxotere was administered intravenously on \n \nDays\n \n 1, 3 and 5 (qodx3).\n\n\nA549 Human Lung Tumor Model\n\n\nAnimals were implanted s.c. by trocar with fragments of A549 tumors harvested from s.c. growing tumors in nude mice hosts. When the tumor size reached 5 mm×5 mm (about 10-17 days) the animals were matched into treatment and control groups. The rest of the study proceeded as described for the HT-29 model, using taxotere and CPT-11 as the standard chemotherapy agents.\n\n\nIn this model unless otherwise noted for the individual study, the tested compounds were administered via the intraperitoneal route on a q3dx5 dose schedule for the CPT-11 combination or on a qdx5 dose regimen for the combination with taxotere; CPT-11 was administered via the intraperitoneal route on a qwx3 schedule; taxotere was administered intravenously on a qodx3 dose regimen.\n\n\nMiaPaCa-2 Human Pancreas Tumor Model\n\n\nAnimals were implanted s.c. by trocar with fragments of MiaPaCa-2 tumors harvested from s.c. growing tumors in nude mice hosts. When the tumor size reached mm×5 mm (about 10-17 days) the animals were matched into treatment and control groups. The rest of the study proceeded as described for the HT-29 model, using gemcitabine as the standard chemotherapy agent.\n\n\nIn this model unless otherwise noted for the individual study, test compounds were administered every third day via the intraperitoneal route on \n \nDays\n \n 1, 4, 7, and 15 (q3dx5); gemcitabine was administered via the intraperitoneal route on \n \nDays\n \n 1, 4, 7 and 10 (q3dx4).\n\n\nDU-145 Human Prostate Tumor Model\n\n\nMale mice were implanted s.c. by trocar with fragments of DU-145 tumors harvested from s.c. growing tumors in nude male mice hosts. When the tumors reached ˜5 mm×5 mm (at about 13-17 days) the animals were matched into treatment and control groups. The remainder of the study proceeded as for the HT-29 model, using taxotere as the standard chemotherapy agent.\n\n\nIn this model unless otherwise noted for the individual study, test compounds were administered via the intraperitoneal route on \n \n \n \nDays\n \n \n \n 1, 3, 5, 8 and 11 (q3dx5); taxotere was administered intravenously on \n \nDays\n \n 1, 3 and 5 (q2dx3).\n\n\n2). Non Subcutaneous Implantation Tumor Models\n\n\nThe animals used were: female nude mice (nu/nu) (MDA-231 study) or B6D2F1 (B16-F10 studies) mice between 5 and 6 weeks of age (˜20 g, Harlan); group size was 10 mice per group unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\nThe cell lines used were: MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor and B16-F10 murine melanoma cells.\n\n\nNPI compounds were administered as monotherapy via the intraperitoneal route at the doses indicated for the individual study; for the combination studies the selected reference chemotherapy agents were injected 15-30 min prior to the NPI compound.\n\n\nMDA-231 Human Breast Tumor\n\n\nFemale nude mice were injected in the mammary fat pad with 2×10\n6 \nMDA-231 cells harvested from in vitro cell culture. When the tumor size reached 5 mm×5 mm (about 14-28 days) the animals were matched into treatment and control groups. The study then proceeded as described for the HT-29 model, using paclitaxel as the standard chemotherapy agent.\n\n\nIn this model unless otherwise noted for the individual study, the test compounds were administered via the intraperitoneal route on \n \n \n \nDays\n \n \n \n 1, 4, 8, 11 and 15 (q3dx5); paclitaxel was administered via the intraperitoneal route on Days 1-5 (qdx5).\n\n\nB16-F10 Metastatic Murine Melanoma Model\n\n\nMice received B16-F10 cells (prepared from an in vitro cell culture of B16-F10 cells) by the iv route on \nDay\n 0. On \nDay\n 1 mice were randomized into treatment and control groups and treatment commenced. Mice were weighed twice weekly, starting on \nDay\n 1. All mice are sacrificed on Day 16, the lungs removed, weighed and the surface colonies counted. Results are expressed as mean colonies of treated mice/mean colonies of control mice (T/C)×100%). The metastasis growth inhibition (MGI) is this number subtracted from 100%. Paclitaxel was the standard chemotherapy agent used in this study.\n\n\nIn this model unless otherwise noted for the individual study, the test compounds were administered via the intraperitoneal route on Days 1-5 (qdx5); paclitaxel was administered intravenously on Days 1-5(qdx5).\n\n\nWhen appropriate (n≧3), results are presented as means±SEM. Statistical analysis of studies with several groups was performed using ANOVA with Neuman-Keuls post test, unless otherwise indicated. A one-tailed t-test was also used based on the hypothesis that the compound or drug, or the combination, would reduce tumor growth.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nStudies in the HT-29 Human Colon Tumor Xenograft Model\n\n\n1. In Vivo Evaluation of KPU-2+/−CPT-11 in the HT-29 Human Colon Tumor Xenograft Model\n\n\nThis study assessed changes in dosage strength and dosing regimen for KPU-2 alone and in combination with a relevant chemotherapeutic CPT-11 in the HT-29 model.\n\n\nKPU-2 was administered at doses of 7.5 mg/kg ip daily for five days (qdx5), 3.75 mg/kg ip bid for five days, 7.5 mg/kg ip every second day for 10 days (qodx5) and 7.5 mg/kg ip every third day for 15 days (q3dx5). The combination of CTP-11 with NPI-2358 at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg ip q3dx5 resulted in a significantly greater effect than for either compound alone, which lasted for the duration of the study (\nFIG. 13\n). These observations during the in-life portion of the study were confirmed by the mean group final tumor weights at autopsy for which only the combination group exhibited a statistically significant lower tumor weight than controls. In addition the difference between the mean tumor weights of the combination therapy and CPT-11 monotherapy groups was statistically significant (\nFIG. 14\n). When the individual final tumor weights at autopsy are examined the greater effect of cotherapy is clear (\nFIG. 14\n). The TGI of cotherapy was 78% as compared to 38.9% for CPT-11 alone. The TGI for the combined therapy group exceeds the NCI criterion of 58% for a positive result.\n\n\n2. Study of KPU-2+/− Standard Chemotherapy vs. Five Human Tumor Xenograft Models\n\n\nThis study consists of five different arms, each with its own protocol, timing, dosing regimen and reference compound. Each arm will be considered within the presentation of the particular tumor model.\n\n\nThe aim of the HT-29 arm of the study was to investigate a slightly higher dose of KPU-2 (10 mg/kg ip q3dx5) in the HT-29 human colon tumor xenograft model as compared to those used in the study described above, in which a marked synergy was observed between KPU-2 (7.5 mg/kg ip q3dx5) and CPT-11 (100 mg/kg ip qwx3).\n\n\nAs can be observed in \nFIG. 15\n, the combination of KPU-2 and CPT-11 in this model resulted in a marked synergy in the inhibition of tumor growth, with the tumor growth being almost completely inhibited up to Treatment Day 29 in the combination therapy group. The combined therapy maintained efficacy and the estimated tumor growth for this group was significantly lower than for either monotherapy group. Accordingly, administration of KPU-2 and CPT-11 inhibited tumor growth and is an effective anti-tumor treatment.\n\n\nThe observations of the in-life portion of the study (estimated tumor growth, \nFIG. 15\n) are supported by measurement of the weights of the tumors excised at autopsy (\nFIG. 16\n). The tumor weights for the combination group was significantly less than the Controls (p<0.01), as were the tumor weights for CPT-11 alone (p<0.05).\n\n\nWhen the individual final tumor weights are considered (\nFIG. 16\n), the tumor size for the combination group was generally smaller than for the other treated or control groups. The TGI of the combination group was 65.8%, indicating a positive effect by the NCI criterion, while monotherapy did not reach the NCI criterion of TGI >58%.\n\n\n3. Study of activity of KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin in the HT-29 Human Colon Tumor Xenograft Study\n\n\nThe results of this study are presented in \nFIG. 17\n and Table 18. The combination therapy groups all indicated a marked synergy between the novel compounds and CPT-11. The individual tumor weights demonstrate the effectiveness of the cotherapy treatment (\nFIG. 18\n). In each case the TGI for the combination group surpasses the NCI criterion for a positive effect, whereas the TGI for CPT-11 monotherapy did not reach this level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 18\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSummary of Studies Performed in the HT-29 Human Colon Tumor Model\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChemotherapeutic\n \nCombination\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStudy Description\n \nNPI-Compound\n \nAgent\n \n \n \nExceed NCI\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNumber\n \n \n \nNumber,\n \nResult\n \nName,\n \nResult\n \nResults\n \nCriterion\n \n \n \n \n \nStatus\n \nEndpoint\n \nmg/kg ip\n \nTGI %\n \nDose\n \nTGI %\n \nTGI %\n \n(TGI ≧ 58%)\n \nComments\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2164\n \nTGI\n \nKPU-2\n \n \n \nCPT-11\n \n39* \n \n78**;#\n \nCombination\n \nSynergy\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7.5 qd × 5\n \nNo Effect\n \n100 ip\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7.5 q3d × 5\n \nNo Effect\n \nqw × 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2288\n \nTGI\n \nKPU-2\n \nNo Effect\n \nCPT-11\n \n 36.5*\n \n65.8**\n \nCombination\n \nSynergy\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 → 7.5\n \n \n \n100 ip\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSee Text\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nq3d × 5\n \n \n \nqw × 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2139\n \nTGI\n \nKPU-2\n \nNo Effect\n \nCPT-11\n \n32.7\n \n80.7**,#\n \nCombination\n \nSynergy\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7.5\n \n \n \n100 ip\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nq3d × 5\n \n \n \nqw × 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2139\n \nTGI\n \nKPU-35\n \nNo Effect\n \nCPT-11\n \n32.7\n \n83.3**,##\n \nCombination\n \nSynergy\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 → 7.5\n \n \n \n100 ip\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 + Day 13\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nq3d × 5\n \n \n \nqw × 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 + Day 27\n \n \n \n2139\n \nTGI\n \nt-butyl-\n \nNo Effect\n \nCPT-11\n \n32.7\n \n77.7*,#\n \nCombination\n \nSynergy\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nphenylahistin\n \n \n \n100 ip\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n30\n \n \n \nqw × 3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nq3d × 5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n*p < 0.05 vs Control;\n \n \n \n**p < 0.01 vs Control;\n \n \n \n#p < 0.05 vs CPT-11 Alone;\n \n \n \n##p < 0.01 vs CPT-11 Alone;\n \n \n \n+ = Number of Deaths\n \n \n \n \n \n\n4. Summary of the Effects of KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin in Combination with CPT-11 in the HT-29 Human Colon Tumor Xenograft Model\n\n\n\nWhen combined with CPT-11, KPU-2 enhanced the effect of CPT-11, the standard chemotherapeutic agent, to a level well in excess of the NCI criterion of a TGI ≧58% for a positive effect. The results generated in the three studies are very comparable for both the in-life observations (\nFIG. 19\n) and for the weights of the tumors excised at autopsy (\nFIG. 20\n).\n\n\nStudies in the DU-145 Human Prostate Tumor Xenograft Model\n\n\nTwo studies have been completed with this model: the first study involved KPU-2 alone and in combination with taxotere; the second study compared KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin alone and in combination with taxotere.\n\n\n1. Effect of KPU-2 in Combination with Taxotere in the DU-145 Human Prostate Tumor Xenograft Model\n\n\nAs can be seen from the data obtained during the in-life portion of this study (\nFIG. 21\n), the most effective treatment of the DU-145 human prostate tumor was the combined therapy of KPU-2 plus taxotere. The treatment effect was most pronounced at the beginning of the study and appeared to be reduced as the study progressed. From treatment Days 20-27, the combination therapy did provide an apparent TGI that exceeded the NCI criterion (TGI>58%), and the estimated tumor weight of the combined therapy was significantly less than for either monotherapy.\n\n\n2. Activity of KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin Alone or in Combination with Taxotere in the DU-145 Human Prostate Xenograft Model\n\n\nBased on the data obtained with KPU-2 in combination with taxotere in the Study described above a second study comparing KPU-2 to KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin alone and in combination with taxotere was initiated.\n\n\nThe observations made during the in-life portion of this study indicate that the combination of either KPU-2 or KPU-35 with taxotere has a greater reduction on tumor growth than for taxotere alone (\nFIG. 22\n). The tumor growth was almost completely blocked by KPU-35 in combination with taxotere.\n\n\nThe excised tumor weights at autopsy confirmed the observations made during the in-life segment of the study. The combination of either KPU-2 (\nFIG. 23\n) or KPU-35 (\nFIG. 24\n) with taxotere was significantly more effective than taxotere alone in blocking tumor growth. In the case of KPU-35, three of ten mice showed evidence for tumor shrinkage. The tumor growth inhibition indices indicated a marked inhibition of tumor growth for KPU-2 (group mean=74.1%) and an almost total block for KPU-35 (group mean=92.5%). Taxotere alone did not reach the NCl established criterion for a positive effect (TGA≧58%).\n\n\n5. Studies in the MCF-7 Human Breast Tumor Xenograft Model\n\n\nThis study compared the effects of KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin in the MCF-7 human breast tumor xenograft model. The doses of the compounds were administered on \n \n \n \nDays\n \n \n \n 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7; Taxotere was administered on \n \nDays\n \n 1,3 and 7.\n\n\nThe selected novel compounds have early onset, statistically significant effects when used in combination with taxotere in this model, apparently almost completely blocking estimated tumor growth (\nFIG. 25\n). Of the three compounds, KPU-2 appeared to be the most effective, with t-butyl-phenylahistin also exhibiting a significant potentiation of taxotere.\n\n\n6. Studies in the A549 Human Non Small Cell Lung Tumor Xenograft Model\n\n\nThe in-life observations during this study (\nFIG. 26\n) indicated that the combination of KPU-2 (7.5 mg/kg ip, qdx5) with taxotere resulted in a marked inhibition of tumor growth as compared to the Control or either monotherapy group. This was confirmed by the autopsy tumor weights, as the mean of the cotherapy group was significantly less than that of taxotere alone or the Control group (\nFIG. 27\n). The cotherapy group tumor weights form a cluster of low tumor weights, indicating the consistency of the effect.\n\n\nWhen the tumor growth index is calculated, the cotherapy group had a TGI of 74.4% as compared to the control group well in excess of the NCl criterion for a positive effect (TGI≧58%). Taxotere alone had a TGI of 26.1%.\n\n\n7. Studies in the MDA-231 Human Breast Tumor Orthotopic Xenograft Model\n\n\nThis model involves the placement of the human tumor tissue into the mouse mammary fat pad, a surrogate of the natural environment. In this manner the possibility of a positive effect due to a specific action on the subcutaneous vascular bed is avoided. This study compared the effect of KPU-2 (7.5 mg/kg ip, q3dx5) alone and in combination with paclitaxel (16 mg/kg ip, qdx5).\n\n\nThree weeks into the study there was a significant inhibition of tumor growth in the combination therapy group, a highly significant effect. This effect appeared to be more marked than for taxotere alone (\nFIG. 28\n).\n\n\n8. Studies in the Murine Melanoma B16 F10 Metastatic Tumor Model\n\n\nThis study examined the effect of KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin alone and in combination with paclitaxel on the number of metastases appearing on the surface of the lung 16 days after the intravenous injection of B16 F10 melanoma cells to the mouse. This model is not a xenograft model; however, it does not involve a high degree of vascularization into the tumor mass.\n\n\nIn this model the most effective treatment was KPU-2 alone (\nFIG. 29\n), having a mean metastases count about 10% less than that for paclitaxel (MGIs of 41.6% and 35.0%, respectively). While this study does not itself establish that combination therapy is more effective than monotherapy, it does indicate that KPU-2, KPU-35 and t-butyl-phenylahistin are most effective in highly vascularized tumors.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 10\n\n\nAssays For Activity Against Pathogenic Fungi\n\n\nComparative activity of a dehydrophenylahistin or its analog against a pathogenic fungus, relative to known antifungal compounds recited above, for use in determining the dehydrophenylahistin or its analog's AF/IS value is measured directly against the fungal organism, e.g. by microtiter plate adaptation of the NCCLS broth macrodilution method described in \nDiagn Micro and Infect Diseases \n21:129-133 (1995). Antifungal activity can also be determined in whole-animal models of fungal infection. For instance, one may employ the steroid-treated mouse model of pulmonary mucormycosis (Goldaill, L. Z. & Sugar, A. M. 1994 \nJ Antimicrob Chemother \n33:369-372). By way of illustration, in such studies, a number of animals are given no dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, various doses of dehydrophenylahistin or its analog (and/or combinations with one or more other antifungal agents), or a positive control (e.g. Amphotericin B), respectively, beginning before, at the time of, or subsequent to infection with the fungus. Animals may be treated once every 24 hours with the selected dose of dehydrophenylahistin or its analog, positive control, or vehicle only. Treatment is continued for a predetermined number of days, e.g. up to ten days. Animals are observed for some time after the treatment period, e.g. for a total of three weeks, with mortality being assessed daily. Models can involve systemic, pulmonary, vaginal and other models of infection with or without other treatments (e.g. treatment with steroids) designed to mimic a human subject susceptible to infection.\n\n\nTo further illustrate, one method for determining the in vivo therapeutic efficacies (ED\n50\n, e.g. expressed in mg dehydrophenylahistin or its analog/kg subject), is a rodent model system. For example, a mouse is infected with the fungal pathogen such as by intravenous infection with approximately 10 times the 50% lethal dose of the pathogen (10\n6 \n \nC. albicans \ncells/mouse). Immediately after the fungal infection, dehydrophenylahistin compounds are given to the mouse at a predetermined dosed volume. The ED\n50 \nis calculated by the method of Van der Waerden (\nArch Exp Pathol Pharmakol \n195:389-412, 1940) from the survival rate recorded on 20th day post-infection. Generally, untreated control animals die 7 to 1 3 days post-infection.\n\n\nIn another illustrative embodiment, \nC. albicans \nWisconsin (C43) and \nC. tropicalis \n(C112), grown on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) slants for 48 h at 28° C., are suspended in saline and adjusted to 46% transmission at 550 nm on a spectrophotometer. The inoculum is further adjusted by hemacytometer and confirmed by plate counts to be approximately 1 or 5×10\n7 \nCFU/ml. CF-1 mice are infected by \n \ninjection\n \n 1 or 5×10\n6 \nCFU into the tail vein. Antifungal agents are administered intravenously or subcutaneously in ethanol:water (10:90), 4 h post infection and once daily thereafter for 3 or 4 more days. Survival is monitored daily. The ED\n50 \ncan be defined as that dose which allows for 50% survival of mice.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 11\n\n\nEvaluating Antimycotic Activity\n\n\nBenzimidazoles and griseofulvin are anti-tubulin agents capable of binding to fungal microtubules. Once bound, these compounds interfere with cell division and intracellular transport in sensitive organisms, resulting in cell death. Commercially, benzimidazoles are used as fungicidal agents in veterinary medicine and plant disease control. A wide variety of fungal species, including \nBotrytis cinerea, Beauveria bassiana, Helminthosporium solani, Saccharomyces cerevisiae \nand \nAspergillus \nare susceptible to these molecules. Toxicity concerns and increasing drug resistance, however, have negatively impacted their usage. Griseofulvin is used clinically to treat ringworm infections of the skin, hair and nails, caused by \nTrichophyton \nsp., \nMicrosporum \nsp., and \nEpidermophyton floccosum\n. Its antifungal spectrum, however, is restricted to this class of fungal organisms. Genotoxicity is also a significant side effect. Terbinafine, while an alternative first-line treatment, is more costly. Further, clinical resistance recently has been observed in \nTrichophyton rubrum \n(the major causative agent for all dermatophyte infections).\n\n\nIn \nCandida albicans\n, microtubule/microfilament formation is affected where cells are exposed to the microtubule inhibitors nocodazole and chloropropham. These results further validate the exploration of cytoskeleton inhibitors as effective antimycotic agents. Accordingly, several of the compounds disclosed herein were evaluated for antimycotic activity.\n\n\nSpecifically, disclosed compounds were evaluated alongside commercially available microtubulin inhibitors as well as recognized antifungal agents. The test compounds and controls used in this study: (−)-Phenylahistin, KPU-1, KPU-2, KPU-11 and KPU-17, KPU-35, t-butyl phenylahistin, Colchicine (commercial microtubulin inhibitor tested versus 3 \nCandida \nisolates), Benomyl (commercial microtubulin inhibitor tested versus 3 \nCandida \nisolates), Griseofulvin (commercial microtubulin inhibitor and antibiotic control for testing versus 6 dermatophyte isolates), Amphotericin B (antibiotic control for testing versus 3 \nCandida \nisolates), Itraconazole (antibiotic control for testing versus 2 \nAspergillus \nisolates).\n\n\nMicroorganisms against which these compounds were tested included: \nCandida albicans, Candida glabrata, Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Epidermophyton floccosum\n. With the exception of \nCandida glabrata \n(one isolate), two isolates of each species were tested.\n\n\nAntifungal susceptibility testing was accomplished according to the methods outlined in the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, M38-A “Reference Method for Broth Dilution Antifungal Susceptibility Testing of Conidium-Forming Filamentous Fungi; Approved Standard.” This includes testing in RPMI-1640 with glutamine and without bicarbonate, an inoculum size of 0.4-5×10\n4\n, and incubation at 30 or 35° C. for 48 hours. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration that resulted in an 80% reduction in turbidity as compared to a drug-free control tube. Drug concentrations were 0.03-16 μg/ml for the investigational compounds, 0.015-8 μg/ml for itraconazole and griseofulvin.\n\n\nThe minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at which a compound prevented the growth of the target microorganism was assessed according to the modified version of the NCCLS protocol. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined at the first 24-hour interval where growth could be determined in the drug-free control tube. The defined MIC was the lowest concentration that exhibited an 80% reduction in turbidity as compared to the growth control. The minimum lethal concentration (MLC) was determined by plating 0.1 μl from the MIC concentration and each concentration above the MIC. The MLC was called at the first concentration that exhibited five or fewer colonies of fungal growth representing a 99.95% kill. When a MIC was obtained, a minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was determined to assess the fungistatic/fungicidal nature of the compound. This procedure entails diluting drug-treated cell samples (removed from test wells containing compound at and above the MIC) to compound concentrations significantly below the inhibitory concentration and depositing them on agar plates. The compound is scored as fungistatic if the cells are able to resume growth and fungicidal if no regrowth is possible because the compound had killed the organisms.\n\n\nCompounds disclosed herein were shown to be effective against two \nTrichophyton \nspecies. \nT. rubrum \nis the principal causative agent for human dermatophytic infections, and would be the key organism to target in the development of a clinical agent.\n\n\nCompounds KPU-2, KPU-11 and KPU-17, KPU-35 & t-butylphenylahistin were equivalent in potency or in some cases more potent than griseofulvin, a current, standard pharmaceutical agent used for treating dermatophytic infections.\n\n\nCompounds (−)-Phenylahistin and KPU-1 were significantly less potent than the other compounds when tested versus \nT. rubrum \nand weaker but more comparable to the others versus the sensitive \nT. mentagrophytes \nisolate.\n\n\nIn those instances when an MFC could be determined, the results indicate that these compounds are fungistatic in nature (see Tables 19 and 20).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntifungal Activity of Dehydrophenylahistins and Analogs

Compounds of such Formulae can modulate CK2 activity and/or PARP activity, for example. Such compounds therefore can be utilized in multiple applications by a person of ordinary skill in the art. For example, compounds described herein may find uses that include, but are not limited to, (i) modulation of protein kinase activity (e.g., CK2 activity), (ii) modulation of polymerase activity (e.g., PARP activity), (iii) modulation of cell proliferation, (iv) modulation of apoptosis, and (v) treatments of cell proliferation related disorders (e.g., administration alone or co-administration with another molecule).\n\n\n“Optionally substituted” as used herein indicates that the particular group or groups being described may have no non-hydrogen substituents, or the group or groups may have one or more non-hydrogen substituents. If not otherwise specified, the total number of such substituents that may be present is equal to the number of H atoms present on the unsubstituted form of the group being described. Where an optional substituent is attached via a double bond, such as a carbonyl oxygen (═O), the group takes up two available valences, so the total number of substituents that may be included is reduced according to the number of available valences.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention often have ionizable groups so as to be capable of preparation as salts. In that case, wherever reference is made to the compound, it is understood in the art that a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may also be used. These salts may be acid addition salts involving inorganic or organic acids or the salts may, in the case of acidic forms of the compounds of the invention be prepared from inorganic or organic bases. Frequently, the compounds are prepared or used as pharmaceutically acceptable salts prepared as addition products of pharmaceutically acceptable acids or bases. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acids and bases are well-known in the art, such as hydrochloric, sulphuric, hydrobromic, acetic, lactic, citric, or tartaric acids for forming acid addition salts, and potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, caffeine, various amines, and the like for forming basic salts. Methods for preparation of the appropriate salts are well-established in the art. In some cases, the compounds may contain both an acidic and a basic functional group, in which case they may have two ionized groups and yet have no net charge.\n\n\nIn some cases, the compounds of the invention contain one or more chiral centers. The invention includes each of the isolated stereoisomeric forms as well as mixtures of stereoisomers in varying degrees of chiral purity, including racemic mixtures. It also encompasses the various diastereomers and tautomers that can be formed. The compounds of the invention may also exist in more than one tautomeric form; the depiction herein of one tautomer is for convenience only, and is also understood to encompass other tautomers of the form shown.\n\n\nAs used herein, the terms “alkyl,” “alkenyl” and “alkynyl” include straight-chain, branched-chain and cyclic monovalent hydrocarbyl radicals, and combinations of these, which contain only C and H when they are unsubstituted. Examples include methyl, ethyl, isobutyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentylethyl, 2-propenyl, 3-butynyl, and the like. The total number of carbon atoms in each such group is sometimes described herein, e.g., when the group can contain up to ten carbon atoms it can be represented as 1-10C or as C1-C10 or C\n1-10\n. When heteroatoms (N, O and S typically) are allowed to replace carbon atoms as in heteroalkyl groups, for example, the numbers describing the group, though still written as e.g. C1-C6, represent the sum of the number of carbon atoms in the group plus the number of such heteroatoms that are included as replacements for carbon atoms in the backbone of the ring or chain being described.\n\n\nTypically, the alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl substituents of the invention contain 1-10C (alkyl) or 2-10C (alkenyl or alkynyl). Preferably they contain 1-8C (alkyl) or 2-8C (alkenyl or alkynyl). Sometimes they contain 1-4C (alkyl) or 2-4C (alkenyl or alkynyl). A single group can include more than one type of multiple bond, or more than one multiple bond; such groups are included within the definition of the term “alkenyl” when they contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond, and are included within the term “alkynyl” when they contain at least one carbon-carbon triple bond.\n\n\nAlkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups are often optionally substituted to the extent that such substitution makes sense chemically. Typical substituents include, but are not limited to, halo, ═O, ═N—CN, ═N—OR, ═NR, OR, NR\n2\n, SR, SO\n2\nR, SO\n2\nNR\n2\n, NRSO\n2\nR, NRCONR\n2\n, NRCOOR, NRCOR, CN, C≡CR, COOR, CONR\n2\n, OOCR, COR, and NO\n2\n, wherein each R is independently H, C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 heteroalkyl, C1-C8 acyl, C2-C8 heteroacyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 heteroalkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, C2-C8 heteroalkynyl, C6-C10 aryl, or C5-C10 heteroaryl, and each R is optionally substituted with halo, ═O, ═N—CN, ═N—OR′, ═NR′, OR′, NR′\n2\n, SR′, SO\n2\nR′, SO\n2\nNR′\n2\n, NR′SO\n2\nR′, NR′CONR′\n2\n, NR′COOR′, NR′COR′, CN, C≡CR′, COOR′, CONR′\n2\n, OOCR′, COR′, and NO\n2\n, wherein each R′ is independently H, C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 heteroalkyl, C1-C8 acyl, C2-C8 heteroacyl, C6-C10 aryl or C5-C10 heteroaryl. Alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups can also be substituted by C1-C8 acyl, C2-C8 heteroacyl, C6-C10 aryl or C5-C10 heteroaryl, each of which can be substituted by the substituents that are appropriate for the particular group.\n\n\n“Acetylene” substituents are 2-10C alkynyl groups that are optionally substituted, and are of the formula —C≡C—R\na\n, wherein R\na \nis H or C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 heteroalkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 heteroalkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, C2-C8 heteroalkynyl, C1-C8 acyl, C2-C8 heteroacyl, C6-C10 aryl, C5-C10 heteroaryl, C7-C12 arylalkyl, or C6-C12 heteroarylalkyl,\n\n \n \n \n \nand each R\na \ngroup is optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from halo, ═O, ═N—CN, ═N—OR′, ═NR′, OR′, NR′\n2\n, SR′, SO\n2\nR′, SO\n2\nNR′\n2\n, NR′SO\n2\nR′, NR′CONR′\n2\n, NR′COOR′, NR′COR′, CN, COOR′, CONR′\n2\n, OOCR′, COR′, and NO\n2\n, wherein each R′ is independently H, C1-C6 alkyl, C2-C6 heteroalkyl, C1-C6 acyl, C2-C6 heteroacyl, C6-C10 aryl, C5-C10 heteroaryl, C7-12 arylalkyl, or C6-12 heteroarylalkyl, each of which is optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from halo, C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C4 heteroalkyl, C1-C6 acyl, C1-C6 heteroacyl, hydroxy, amino, and ═O; and wherein two R′ can be linked to form a 3-7 membered ring optionally containing up to three heteroatoms selected from N, O and S. In some embodiments, R\na \nof —C≡C—R\na \nis H or Me.\n \n \n \n\n\n“Heteroalkyl”, “heteroalkenyl”, and “heteroalkynyl” and the like are defined similarly to the corresponding hydrocarbyl (alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl) groups, but the ‘hetero’ terms refer to groups that contain 1-3 O, S or N heteroatoms or combinations thereof within the backbone residue; thus at least one carbon atom of a corresponding alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl group is replaced by one of the specified heteroatoms to form a heteroalkyl, heteroalkenyl, or heteroalkynyl group. The typical and preferred sizes for heteroforms of alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups are generally the same as for the corresponding hydrocarbyl groups, and the substituents that may be present on the heteroforms are the same as those described above for the hydrocarbyl groups. For reasons of chemical stability, it is also understood that, unless otherwise specified, such groups do not include more than two contiguous heteroatoms except where an oxo group is present on N or S as in a nitro or sulfonyl group.\n\n\nWhile “alkyl” as used herein includes cycloalkyl and cycloalkylalkyl groups, the term “cycloalkyl” may be used herein to describe a carbocyclic non-aromatic group that is connected via a ring carbon atom, and “cycloalkylalkyl” may be used to describe a carbocyclic non-aromatic group that is connected to the molecule through an alkyl linker. Similarly, “heterocyclyl” may be used to describe a non-aromatic cyclic group that contains at least one heteroatom as a ring member and that is connected to the molecule via a ring atom, which may be C or N; and “heterocyclylalkyl” may be used to describe such a group that is connected to another molecule through a linker. The sizes and substituents that are suitable for the cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heterocyclyl, and heterocyclylalkyl groups are the same as those described above for alkyl groups. As used herein, these terms also include rings that contain a double bond or two, as long as the ring is not aromatic.\n\n\nAs used herein, “acyl” encompasses groups comprising an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl or arylalkyl radical attached at one of the two available valence positions of a carbonyl carbon atom, and heteroacyl refers to the corresponding groups wherein at least one carbon other than the carbonyl carbon has been replaced by a heteroatom chosen from N, O and S. Thus heteroacyl includes, for example, —C(═O)OR and —C(═O)NR\n2 \nas well as —C(═O)-heteroaryl.\n\n\nAcyl and heteroacyl groups are bonded to any group or molecule to which they are attached through the open valence of the carbonyl carbon atom. Typically, they are C1-C8 acyl groups, which include formyl, acetyl, pivaloyl, and benzoyl, and C2-C8 heteroacyl groups, which include methoxyacetyl, ethoxycarbonyl, and 4-pyridinoyl. The hydrocarbyl groups, aryl groups, and heteroforms of such groups that comprise an acyl or heteroacyl group can be substituted with the substituents described herein as generally suitable substituents for each of the corresponding component of the acyl or heteroacyl group.\n\n\n“Aromatic” moiety or “aryl” moiety refers to a monocyclic or fused bicyclic moiety having the well-known characteristics of aromaticity; examples include phenyl and naphthyl. Similarly, “heteroaromatic” and “heteroaryl” refer to such monocyclic or fused bicyclic ring systems which contain as ring members one or more heteroatoms selected from O, S and N. The inclusion of a heteroatom permits aromaticity in 5-membered rings as well as 6-membered rings. Typical heteroaromatic systems include monocyclic C5-C6 aromatic groups such as pyridyl, pyrimidyl, pyrazinyl, thienyl, furanyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, and imidazolyl and the fused bicyclic moieties formed by fusing one of these monocyclic groups with a phenyl ring or with any of the heteroaromatic monocyclic groups to form a C8-C10 bicyclic group such as indolyl, benzimidazolyl, indazolyl, benzotriazolyl, isoquinolyl, quinolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzofuranyl, pyrazolopyridyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, cinnolinyl, and the like. Any monocyclic or fused ring bicyclic system which has the characteristics of aromaticity in terms of electron distribution throughout the ring system is included in this definition. It also includes bicyclic groups where at least the ring which is directly attached to the remainder of the molecule has the characteristics of aromaticity. Typically, the ring systems contain 5-12 ring member atoms. Preferably the monocyclic heteroaryls contain 5-6 ring members, and the bicyclic heteroaryls contain 8-10 ring members.\n\n\nAryl and heteroaryl moieties may be substituted with a variety of substituents including C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, C5-C12 aryl, C1-C8 acyl, and heteroforms of these, each of which can itself be further substituted; other substituents for aryl and heteroaryl moieties include halo, OR, NR\n2\n, SR, SO\n2\nR, SO\n2\nNR\n2\n, NRSO\n2\nR, NRCONR\n2\n, NRCOOR, NRCOR, CN, C≡CR, COOR, CONR\n2\n, OOCR, COR, and NO\n2\n, wherein each R is independently H, C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 heteroalkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 heteroalkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, C2-C8 heteroalkynyl, C6-C10 aryl, C5-C10 heteroaryl, C7-C12 arylalkyl, or C6-C12 heteroarylalkyl, and each R is optionally substituted as described above for alkyl groups. The substituent groups on an aryl or heteroaryl group may of course be further substituted with the groups described herein as suitable for each type of such substituents or for each component of the substituent. Thus, for example, an arylalkyl substituent may be substituted on the aryl portion with substituents described herein as typical for aryl groups, and it may be further substituted on the alkyl portion with substituents described herein as typical or suitable for alkyl groups.\n\n\nSimilarly, “arylalkyl” and “heteroarylalkyl” refer to aromatic and heteroaromatic ring systems which are bonded to their attachment point through a linking group such as an alkylene, including substituted or unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated, cyclic or acyclic linkers. Typically the linker is C1-C8 alkyl or a hetero form thereof. These linkers may also include a carbonyl group, thus making them able to provide substituents as an acyl or heteroacyl moiety. An aryl or heteroaryl ring in an arylalkyl or heteroarylalkyl group may be substituted with the same substituents described above for aryl groups. Preferably, an arylalkyl group includes a phenyl ring optionally substituted with the groups defined above for aryl groups and a C1-C4 alkylene that is unsubstituted or is substituted with one or two C1-C4 alkyl groups or heteroalkyl groups, where the alkyl or heteroalkyl groups can optionally cyclize to form a ring such as cyclopropane, dioxolane, or oxacyclopentane. Similarly, a heteroarylalkyl group preferably includes a C5-C6 monocyclic heteroaryl group that is optionally substituted with the groups described above as substituents typical on aryl groups and a C1-C4 alkylene that is unsubstituted or is substituted with one or two C1-C4 alkyl groups or heteroalkyl groups, or it includes an optionally substituted phenyl ring or C5-C6 monocyclic heteroaryl and a C1-C4 heteroalkylene that is unsubstituted or is substituted with one or two C1-C4 alkyl or heteroalkyl groups, where the alkyl or heteroalkyl groups can optionally cyclize to form a ring such as cyclopropane, dioxolane, or oxacyclopentane.\n\n\nWhere an arylalkyl or heteroarylalkyl group is described as optionally substituted, the substituents may be on either the alkyl or heteroalkyl portion or on the aryl or heteroaryl portion of the group. The substituents optionally present on the alkyl or heteroalkyl portion are the same as those described above for alkyl groups generally; the substituents optionally present on the aryl or heteroaryl portion are the same as those described above for aryl groups generally.\n\n\n“Arylalkyl” groups as used herein are hydrocarbyl groups if they are unsubstituted, and are described by the total number of carbon atoms in the ring and alkylene or similar linker. Thus a benzyl group is a C7-arylalkyl group, and phenylethyl is a C8-arylalkyl.\n\n\n“Heteroarylalkyl” as described above refers to a moiety comprising an aryl group that is attached through a linking group, and differs from “arylalkyl” in that at least one ring atom of the aryl moiety or one atom in the linking group is a heteroatom selected from N, O and S. The heteroarylalkyl groups are described herein according to the total number of atoms in the ring and linker combined, and they include aryl groups linked through a heteroalkyl linker; heteroaryl groups linked through a hydrocarbyl linker such as an alkylene; and heteroaryl groups linked through a heteroalkyl linker. Thus, for example, C7-heteroarylalkyl would include pyridylmethyl, phenoxy, and N-pyrrolylmethoxy.\n\n\n“Alkylene” as used herein refers to a divalent hydrocarbyl group; because it is divalent, it can link two other groups together. Typically it refers to —(CH\n2\n)\nn\n— where n is 1-8 and preferably n is 1-4, though where specified, an alkylene can also be substituted by other groups, and can be of other lengths, and the open valences need not be at opposite ends of a chain. Thus —CH(Me)- and —C(Me)\n2\n- may also be referred to as alkylenes, as can a cyclic group such as cyclopropan-1,1-diyl. Where an alkylene group is substituted, the substituents include those typically present on alkyl groups as described herein.\n\n\nIn general, any alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl, or aryl or arylalkyl group or any heteroform of one of these groups that is contained in a substituent may itself optionally be substituted by additional substituents. The nature of these substituents is similar to those recited with regard to the primary substituents themselves if the substituents are not otherwise described. Thus, where an embodiment of, for example, R\n7 \nis alkyl, this alkyl may optionally be substituted by the remaining substituents listed as embodiments for R\n7 \nwhere this makes chemical sense, and where this does not undermine the size limit provided for the alkyl per se; e.g., alkyl substituted by alkyl or by alkenyl would simply extend the upper limit of carbon atoms for these embodiments, and is not included. However, alkyl substituted by aryl, amino, alkoxy, ═O, and the like would be included within the scope of the invention, and the atoms of these substituent groups are not counted in the number used to describe the alkyl, alkenyl, etc. group that is being described. Where no number of substituents is specified, each such alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl, or aryl group may be substituted with a number of substituents according to its available valences; in particular, any of these groups may be substituted with fluorine atoms at any or all of its available valences, for example.\n\n\n“Heteroform” as used herein refers to a derivative of a group such as an alkyl, aryl, or acyl, wherein at least one carbon atom of the designated carbocyclic group has been replaced by a heteroatom selected from N, O and S. Thus the heteroforms of alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl, aryl, and arylalkyl are heteroalkyl, heteroalkenyl, heteroalkynyl, heteroacyl, heteroaryl, and heteroarylalkyl, respectively. It is understood that no more than two N, O or S atoms are ordinarily connected sequentially, except where an oxo group is attached to N or S to form a nitro or sulfonyl group.\n\n\n“Halo”, as used herein includes fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. Fluoro and chloro are often preferred.\n\n\n“Amino” as used herein refers to NH\n2\n, but where an amino is described as “substituted” or “optionally substituted”, the term includes NR′R″ wherein each R′ and R″ is independently H, or is an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl, aryl, or arylalkyl group or a heteroform of one of these groups, and each of the alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl, aryl, or arylalkyl groups or heteroforms of one of these groups is optionally substituted with the substituents described herein as suitable for the corresponding group. The term also includes forms wherein R′ and R″ are linked together to form a 3-8 membered ring which may be saturated, unsaturated or aromatic and which contains 1-3 heteroatoms independently selected from N, O and S as ring members, and which is optionally substituted with the substituents described as suitable for alkyl groups or, if NR′R″ is an aromatic group, it is optionally substituted with the substituents described as typical for heteroaryl groups.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “carbocycle” refers to a cyclic compound containing only carbon atoms in the ring, whereas a “heterocycle” refers to a cyclic compound comprising a heteroatom. The carbocyclic and heterocyclic structures encompass compounds having monocyclic, bicyclic or multiple ring systems.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “heteroatom” refers to any atom that is not carbon or hydrogen, such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur.\n\n\nIllustrative examples of heterocycles include but are not limited to tetrahydrofuran, 1,3 dioxolane, 2,3 dihydrofuran, pyran, tetrahydropyran, benzofuran, isobenzofuran, 1,3 dihydro isobenzofuran, isoxazole, 4,5 dihydroisoxazole, piperidine, pyrrolidine, \npyrrolidin\n 2 one, pyrrole, pyridine, pyrimidine, octahydro pyrrolo[3,4 b]pyridine, piperazine, pyrazine, morpholine, thiomorpholine, imidazole, \n \nimidazolidine\n \n 2,4 dione, 1,3 \ndihydrobenzimidazol\n 2 one, indole, thiazole, benzothiazole, thiadiazole, thiophene, \n \ntetrahydro thiophene\n \n 1,1 dioxide, diazepine, triazole, guanidine, diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, 2,5 diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, 2,3,4,4a,9,9a hexahydro 1H β carboline, oxirane, oxetane, tetrahydropyran, dioxane, lactones, aziridine, azetidine, piperidine, lactams, and may also encompass heteroaryls. Other illustrative examples of heteroaryls include but are not limited to furan, pyrrole, pyridine, pyrimidine, imidazole, benzimidazole and triazole.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “inorganic substituent” refers to substituents that do not contain carbon or contain carbon bound to elements other than hydrogen (e.g., elemental carbon, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and carbonate). Examples of inorganic substituents include but are not limited to nitro, halogen, azido, cyano, sulfonyls, sulfinyls, sulfonates, phosphates, etc.\n\n\nThe terms “treat” and “treating” as used herein refer to ameliorating, alleviating, lessening, and removing symptoms of a disease or condition. A candidate molecule or compound described herein may be in a therapeutically effective amount in a formulation or medicament, which is an amount that can lead to a biological effect, such as apoptosis of certain cells (e.g., cancer cells), reduction of proliferation of certain cells, or lead to ameliorating, alleviating, lessening, or removing symptoms of a disease or condition, for example. The terms also can refer to reducing or stopping a cell proliferation rate (e.g., slowing or halting tumor growth) or reducing the number of proliferating cancer cells (e.g., removing part or all of a tumor). These terms also are applicable to reducing a titre of a microorganism in a system (i.e., cell, tissue, or subject) infected with a microorganism, reducing the rate of microbial propagation, reducing the number of symptoms or an effect of a symptom associated with the microbial infection, and/or removing detectable amounts of the microbe from the system. Examples of microorganism include but are not limited to virus, bacterium and fungus.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “apoptosis” refers to an intrinsic cell self-destruction or suicide program. In response to a triggering stimulus, cells undergo a cascade of events including cell shrinkage, blebbing of cell membranes and chromatic condensation and fragmentation. These events culminate in cell conversion to clusters of membrane-bound particles (apoptotic bodies), which are thereafter engulfed by macrophages.\n\n\nThe invention in part provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound within the scope of the invention as described herein, and methods of using compounds described herein. For example, the invention in part provides methods for identifying a candidate molecule that interacts with a CK2 or PARP protein, which comprises contacting a composition containing a CK2 or PARP protein and a molecule described herein with a candidate molecule and determining whether the amount of the molecule described herein that interacts with the protein is modulated, whereby a candidate molecule that modulates the amount of the molecule described herein that interacts with the protein is identified as a candidate molecule that interacts with the protein.\n\n\nAlso provided are methods for modulating the activity of a CK2 protein or PARP protein, which comprises contacting a system comprising the protein with a compound described herein in an amount effective for modulating (e.g., inhibiting) the activity of the protein. The system in such embodiments can be a cell-free system or a system comprising cells. Also provided are methods for reducing cell proliferation, and optionally inducing apoptosis, which comprises contacting cells with a compound described herein in an amount effective to reduce proliferation of the cells. The cells in such embodiments can be in a cell line, in a tissue or in a subject (e.g., a research animal or human). In related embodiments, provided are compositions comprising a compound described herein in combination with a protein or cell, such as an isolated protein (e.g., isolated CK2 or other serine-threonine protein kinase protein or PARP protein) or a cell in a cell line (e.g., HCT-116 cell line).\n\n\nProvided also are methods for modulating a serine-threonine protein kinase activity. Serine-threonine protein kinases catalyze the transfer of a gamma phosphate from adenosine triphosphate to a serine or threonine amino acid in a peptide or protein substrate. Thus, included herein are methods which comprise contacting a system comprising a serine-threonine protein kinase protein with a compound described herein in an amount effective for modulating (e.g., inhibiting) the activity of the protein. In some embodiments, the activity of the serine-threonine protein kinase is the catalytic activity of the protein (e.g., catalyzing the transfer of a gamma phosphate from adenosine triphosphate to a peptide or protein substrate). In certain embodiments, provided are methods for identifying a candidate molecule that interacts with a serine-threonine protein kinase, which comprise: contacting a composition containing a serine-threonine protein kinase and a compound described herein with a candidate molecule under conditions in which the compound and the protein interact, and determining whether the amount of the compound that interacts with the protein is modulated relative to a control interaction between the compound and the protein without the candidate molecule, whereby a candidate molecule that modulates the amount of the compound interacting with the protein relative to the control interaction is identified as a candidate molecule that interacts with the protein. Systems in such embodiments can be a cell-free system or a system comprising cells (e.g., in vitro). The protein, the compound or the molecule in some embodiments is in association with a solid phase. In certain embodiments, the interaction between the compound and the protein is detected via a detectable label, where in some embodiments the protein comprises a detectable label and in certain embodiments the compound comprises a detectable label. The interaction between the compound and the protein sometimes is detected without a detectable label.\n\n\nThe serine-threonine protein kinase can be from any source, such as a mammal, ape or human, for example. Examples of serine-threonine protein kinases that can be inhibited by compounds disclosed herein include without limitation human versions of CK2, CK2α2, Pim-1, CDK1/cyclinB, c-RAF, Mer, MELK, DYRK2, Flt3, Flt3 (D835Y), Flt4, HIPK3, HIPK2, ZIPK and ZIPK. A serine-threonine protein kinase sometimes is a member of a sub-family containing one or more of the following amino acids at positions corresponding to those listed in human CK2: leucine at position 45, methionine at position 163 and isoleucine at position 174. Examples of such protein kinases include without limitation human versions of CK2, STK10, HIPK2, HIPK3, DAPK3, DYK2 and PIM-1. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences for serine-threonine protein kinases and reagents are publicly available (e.g., World Wide Web URLs ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez/ and Invitrogen.com).\n\n\nThe invention also in part provides methods for treating a condition related to aberrant cell proliferation. For example, provided are methods of treating a cell proliferative condition in a subject, which comprises administering a compound described herein to a subject in need thereof in an amount effective to treat the cell proliferative condition. The subject may be a research animal (e.g., rodent, dog, cat, monkey), optionally containing a tumor such as a xenograft tumor (e.g., human tumor), for example, or may be a human. A cell proliferative condition sometimes is a tumor or non-tumor cancer, including but not limited to, cancers of the colorectum, breast, lung, liver, pancreas, lymph node, colon, prostate, brain, head and neck, skin, liver, kidney, blood and heart (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, carcinoma).\n\n\nAlso provided are methods for treating a condition related to inflammation or pain. For example, provided are methods of treating pain in a subject, which comprise administering a compound described herein to a subject in need thereof in an amount effective to treat the pain. Provided also are methods of treating inflammation in a subject, which comprises administering a compound described herein to a subject in need thereof in an amount effective to treat the inflammation.

Conditions associated with inflammation and pain include without limitation acid reflux, heartburn, acne, allergies and sensitivities, Alzheimer's disease, asthma, atherosclerosis, bronchitis, carditis, celiac disease, chronic pain, Crohn's disease, cirrhosis, colitis, dementia, dermatitis, diabetes, dry eyes, edema, emphysema, eczema, fibromyalgia, gastroenteritis, gingivitis, heart disease, hepatitis, high blood pressure, insulin resistance, interstitial cystitis, joint pain/arthritis/rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic syndrome (syndrome X), myositis, nephritis, obesity, osteopenia, osteoporosis, Parkinson's disease, periodontal disease, polyarteritis, polychondritis, psoriasis, scleroderma, sinusitis, Sjögren's syndrome, spastic colon, systemic candidiasis, tendonitis, urinary track infections, vaginitis, inflammatory cancer (e.g., inflammatory breast cancer) and the like. Methods for determining effects of compounds herein on pain or inflammation are known. For example, formalin-stimulated pain behaviors in research animals can be monitored after administration of a compound described herein to assess treatment of pain (e.g., Li et al., \nPain \n115(1-2): 182-90 (2005)). Also, modulation of pro-inflammatory molecules (e.g., IL-8, GRO-alpha, MCP-1, TNFalpha and iNOS) can be monitored after administration of a compound described herein to assess treatment of inflammation (e.g., Parhar et al., \nInt J Colorectal Dis. \n22(6): 601-9 (2006)), for example. Thus, also provided are methods for determining whether a compound herein reduces inflammation or pain, which comprise contacting a system with a compound described herein in an amount effective for modulating (e.g., inhibiting) the activity of a pain signal or inflammation signal. Provided also are methods for identifying a compound that reduces inflammation or pain, which comprise: contacting a system with a compound of Formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV or XVI; and detecting a pain signal or inflammation signal, whereby a compound that modulates the pain signal relative to a control molecule is identified as a compound that reduces inflammation of pain. Non-limiting examples of pain signals are formalin-stimulated pain behaviors and examples of inflammation signals include without limitation a level of a pro-inflammatory molecule.\n\n\nThe invention also in part pertains to methods for modulating angiogenesis in a subject, and methods for treating a condition associated with aberrant angiogenesis in a subject. Thus, provided are methods for determining whether a compound herein modulates angiogenesis, which comprise contacting a system with a compound described herein in an amount effective for modulating (e.g., inhibiting) angiogenesis or a signal associated with angiogenesis. Signals associated with angiogenesis are levels of a pro-angiogenesis growth factor such as VEGF. Methods for assessing modulation of angiogenesis also are known, such as analyzing human endothelial tube formation (BD BioCoat™ Angiogenesis System from BD Biosciences). Provided also are methods for identifying a compound that modulates angiogenesis, which comprise contacting a system with a compound of Formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV or XVI; and detecting angiogenesis in the system or an angiogenesis signal, whereby a compound that modulates the angiogenesis or angiogenesis signal relative to a control molecule is identified as a compound that modulates angiogenesis. Also provided are methods for treating an angiogenesis condition, which comprise administering a compound described herein to a subject in need thereof in an amount effective to treat the angiogenesis condition. Angiogenesis conditions include without limitation solid tumor cancers, varicose disease and the like.\n\n\nAny suitable formulation of a compound described above can be prepared for administration. Any suitable route of administration may be used, including, but not limited to, oral, parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, transdermal, topical and subcutaneous routes. Depending on the subject to be treated, the mode of administration, and the type of treatment desired—e.g., prevention, prophylaxis, therapy; the compounds are formulated in ways consonant with these parameters. Preparation of suitable formulations for each route of administration are known in the art. A summary of such formulation methods and techniques is found in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences\n, latest edition, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., which is incorporated herein by reference. The formulation of each substance or of the combination of two substances will generally include a diluent as well as, in some cases, adjuvants, buffers, preservatives and the like. The substances to be administered can be administered also in liposomal compositions or as microemulsions.\n\n\nFor injection, formulations can be prepared in conventional forms as liquid solutions or suspensions or as solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection or as emulsions. Suitable excipients include, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol and the like. Such compositions may also contain amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like, such as, for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, and so forth.\n\n\nVarious sustained release systems for drugs have also been devised, and can be applied to compounds of the invention. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,677, the methods of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nSystemic administration may also include relatively noninvasive methods such as the use of suppositories, transdermal patches, transmucosal delivery and intranasal administration. Oral administration is also suitable for compounds of the invention. Suitable forms include syrups, capsules, tablets, as is understood in the art.\n\n\nFor administration to animal or human subjects, the appropriate dosage of the a compound described above often is 0.01-15 mg/kg, and sometimes 0.1-10 mg/kg. Dosage levels are dependent on the nature of the condition, drug efficacy, the condition of the patient, the judgment of the practitioner, and the frequency and mode of administration; however, optimization of such parameters is within the ordinary level of skill in the art.\n\n\nTherapeutic Combinations\n\n\nThe invention provides methods to treat conditions such as cancer and inflammation by administering to a subject in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a therapeutic agent that binds to certain DNA segments and administering to the same subject a PARP or CK2 modulator in an amount that is effective to enhance the activity of the therapeutic agent. A PARP or CK2 modulator is an agent that inhibits or enhances a biological activity of a PARP protein or a CK2 protein, and is generically referred to hereafter as a “modulator.” The therapeutic agent and the modulator may be administered together, either as separate pharmaceutical compositions or admixed in a single pharmaceutical composition. The therapeutic agent and the modulator may also be administered separately, including at different times and with different frequencies, as long as the modulator is administered at a time that increases the potency of the therapeutic agent. The modulator may be administered by any known route, such as orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, nasally, and the like; and the therapeutic agent may also be administered by any conventional route. In many embodiments, at least one and optionally both of the modulator and the therapeutic agent may be administered orally.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the modulator and the therapeutic agent are administered at the same time, whether in separate dosages or admixed in a single dosage. Where the frequency of administration of the two materials can be adjusted to match, the modulator and therapeutic agent are preferably combined into a single pharmaceutical composition, so the treated patient may receive a single oral dosage or a single injection, for example.\n\n\nThe amount of each of these materials to be administered will vary with the route of administration, the condition of the subject, other treatments being administered to the subject, and other parameters. The therapeutic agents of the invention may, of course, cause multiple desired effects; and the amount of modulator to be used in combination with the therapeutic agent should be an amount that increases one or more of these desired effects. The modulator is to be administered in an amount that is effective to enhance a desired effect of the therapeutic agent. An amount is “effective to enhance a desired effect of the therapeutic agent”, as used herein, if it increases by at least about 25% at least one of the desired effects of the therapeutic agent alone. Preferably, it is an amount that increases a desired effect of the therapeutic agent by at least 50% or by at least 100% (i.e., it doubles the effective activity of the therapeutic agent.) In some embodiments, it is an amount that increases a desired effect of the therapeutic agent by at least 200%.\n\n\nThe amount of a modulator that increases a desired effect of a therapeutic agent may be determined using in vitro methods, such as cell proliferation assays. The therapeutic agents of the invention are useful to counter hyperproliferative disorders such as cancer, thus they reduce cell proliferation. Thus, for example, a suitable amount of a modulator could be the amount needed to enhance an antiproliferative effect of a therapeutic agent by at least 25% as determined in a cell proliferation assay.\n\n\nThe modulator used in the present invention enhances at least one desired effect produced by the therapeutic agent it is used with, thus the combinations of the invention provide a synergistic effect, not merely an additive effect. The modulators themselves are at times useful for treating the same types of conditions, and thus may also have some direct effect in such assays. In that event, the “amount effective to increase a desired effect” must be a synergistic enhancement of the activity of the therapeutic agent that is attributable to enhancement by the modulator of an effect of the therapeutic agent, rather than a simple additive effect that would be expected with separate administration of the two materials. In many cases, the modulator can be used in an amount (concentration) that would not be expected to have any apparent effect on the treated subject or the in vitro assay, so the increased effect achieved with the combination is directly attributable to a synergistic effect.\n\n\nThe present invention includes methods and compositions for treating a patient having a cell proliferation disorder or an inflammatory disorder with a therapeutic agent as described herein, and a “modulator” described above, where the timing of administration of the modulator permits it to enhance a desired effect of the therapeutic agent.\n\n\nModulators of PARP and CK2 are known. Inhibitors of PARP are well known in the art, and some have been shown to potentiate the activity of other drugs for certain uses. For example, it has been reported that treating a carcinoma cell colony with a PARP inhibitor at a concentration that had no substantial growth inhibition or cellular toxicity alone increased the activity of cytotoxic agents temozolomide and topotecan substantially. C. R. Calabrese, et al., \nClin. Cancer Res\n., vol. 9, 2711-18 (July 2003). This effect is believed to be related to the role PARP plays in DNA repair: because PARP promotes repair of damaged DNA, it is thought to increase the effects of compounds that act by damaging DNA. These include compounds that alkylate DNA, which may include temozolomide, and topoisomerase inhibitors such as topotecan. Id.\n\n\nThe present invention relates to the use of a “modulator” as described above in combination with a therapeutic agent that can act by binding to regions of DNA that can form certain quadruplex structures; the therapeutic agents have anticancer activity on their own, but their activity is enhanced when they are used in combination with a modulator. This synergistic effect allows the therapeutic agent to be administered in a lower dosage while achieving equivalent or higher levels of at least one desired effect.\n\n\nThe therapeutic agents of the invention are compounds that bind to certain motifs in nucleic acids. The therapeutic agent to be used can be selected from several different classes of compounds, such as those that bind to quadruplex-forming regions of DNA. The therapeutic agents are useful for the treatment of cancer and other indications such as inflammatory disorders, and methods for making and using them are known in the art. Several preferred classes of these therapeutic agents are described below. Each class of therapeutic agents can be used in combination with any active PARP inhibitor, including but not limited to those disclosed herein.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the therapeutic agent can be a compound of formula (TA1-1):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters and prodrugs thereof;\n\n\nwherein V is H, halo, or NR\n1\nR\n2\n;\n\n\nA is H, fluoro, or NR\n1\n \n2\n;\n\n\nZ is O, S, NR\n1 \nor CH\n2\n;\n\n\nU is OR\n2 \nor NR\n1\nR\n2\n;\n\n\nX is OR\n2\n, NR\n1\nR\n2\n, halo, azido, or SR\n2\n;\n\n\nn is 1-3;\n\n\nwherein in NR\n1\nR\n2\n, R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nmay form a double bond or a ring, each of which is optionally substituted;\n\n\nR\n1 \nis H or a C\n1-6 \nalkyl;\n\n\nR\n2 \nis H or a C\n1-10 \nalkyl or C\n2-10 \nalkenyl optionally containing one or more non-adjacent heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, and optionally substituted with a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring; or R\n2 \nis an optionally substituted heterocyclic ring, aryl or heteroaryl;\n\n\nR\n5 \nis a substituent at any position on W; and is H, OR\n2\n, C\n1-6 \nalkyl, C\n2-6 \nalkenyl, each optionally substituted by halo, ═O or one or more heteroatoms; or R\n5 \nis an inorganic substituent; and\n\n\nW is an optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl, which may be monocyclic or fused with a single or multiple ring and optionally containing a heteroatom;\n\n\nor a compound having formula (TA1-2):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein V, A, X, Z and U are as defined in formula TA1-1, and W is selected from the group consisting of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein Q, Q\n1\n, Q\n2\n, and Q\n3 \nare independently CH or N;\n\n\nY is independently O, CH, ═O or NR\n1\n; and\n\n\nR\n5 \nis as defined in \nformula\n 1.\n\n\nCompounds of this structure, and methods for making and using them, are described in U.S. patent application Ser.

No. 11/404,947, to Whitten, et al., which was filed on Apr. 14, 2006, and is entitled QUINOBENZOXAZINE ANALOGS AND METHODS OF USING THEREOF.\n\n\nThe present invention utilizes the above therapeutic agents in combination with at least one modulator. Examples of PARP inhibitors are known in the art, and are disclosed, for example, in C. R. Calebrese, et al., \nClin. Cancer Res\n. vol. 9, 2711-18 (2003); S. J. Veuger, et al., \nCancer Res\n. vol. 63, 6008-15 (2003); C. R. Calabrese et al., \nJ. Nat'l. Cancer Inst. \n96(1), 56-67 (2004); “Potent Novel PARP Inhibitors,” \nExpert Reviews in Molecular Medicine\n, vol. 7(4) (March 2005); and P. Jagtap, \nNature Rev.: Drug Discovery\n, vol. 4, 421-40 (20045). The PARP inhibitors disclosed in these documents are suitable for use in the methods and compositions of the present invention. Additional PARP inhibitors that can be used include, for example, 10-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-2H-7-oxa-1,2-diaza-benzo[de]anthracen-3-one (GPI 15427) and 2-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-5H-benzo[c][1,5]naphthyridin-6-one (GPI 16539). See Di Paola, et al., \nEur. J. Pharmacology, \n527(1-3), 163-71 (2005). Representative, but non-limiting, examples of PARP inhibitors that are suitable for use in the invention include the known compounds shown hereafter, including the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and individual isomers or mixtures of isomers thereof.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModulators that can be utilized in combination with a therapeutic agent described above also include compounds having structures of Formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI or XII described herein.\n\n\nThe compound TA1-1A is a preferred therapeutic agent for use in the methods and compositions of the invention. More detail on suitable methods for its formulation and administration are provided in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/803,864 to Lim, et al., which was filed on Jun. 3, 2006.\n\n\nThe invention also in part provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one therapeutic agent within the scope of the invention as described herein in combination with at least one modulator. Optionally, the composition may comprise a diluent or other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.\n\n\nFor administration to animal or human subjects, the appropriate dosage of the therapeutic agent is typically 0.01-15 mg/kg, preferably 0.1-10 mg/kg. Dosage levels are dependent on the nature of the condition, drug efficacy, the condition of the patient, the judgment of the practitioner, and the frequency and mode of administration; however, optimization of such parameters is within the ordinary level of skill in the art.\n\n\nSimilarly, the dosage of a modulator, such as a compound of Formula I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI or XII described herein, is typically between about 0.01-15 mg/kg, and about 0.1-10 mg/kg. A modulator may be separately active for treating a cancer. For combination therapies described above, when used in combination with a therapeutic agent, the dosage of a modulator will frequently be two-fold to ten-fold lower than the dosage required when the modulator is used alone to treat the same condition or subject. Determination of a suitable amount of the modulator for use in combination with a therapeutic agent is readily determined by methods known in the art.\n\n\nAlso provided are methods for modulating the activity of a PARP protein, which comprises contacting a system comprising the PARP protein with a composition described herein in an amount effective for modulating (e.g., inhibiting) the activity of the protein. The system in such embodiments can be a cell-free system or a system comprising cells. Also provided are methods for reducing cell proliferation, and optionally inducing apoptosis, which comprises contacting cells with a composition or a combination therapy as described herein, wherein a therapeutic agent is administered in an amount effective to reduce proliferation of the cells, and a PARP inhibitor is administered in an amount sufficient to enhance the efficacy of the therapeutic agent. The cells in such embodiments can be in a cell line, in a tissue or in a subject (e.g., a research animal or human).\n\n\nThe invention also in part provides methods for treating a condition related to aberrant cell proliferation. For example, provided are methods of treating a cell proliferative condition in a subject, which comprises administering a therapeutic agent described herein and a PARP inhibitor described herein to a subject in need of treatment for a cell proliferative disorder; the therapeutic agent and the PARP inhibitor are administered in amounts effective to treat the cell proliferative condition. The subject may be a research animal (e.g., rodent, dog, cat, monkey), optionally containing a tumor such as a xenograft tumor (e.g., human tumor), for example, or may be a human.\n\n\nA cell proliferative condition sometimes is a tumor or non-tumor cancer, including but not limited to, cancers of the colorectum, breast, lung, liver, pancreas, lymph node, colon, prostate, brain, head and neck, skin, liver, kidney, blood and heart (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, carcinoma).\n\n\nAny suitable formulation of the therapeutic agent and the PARP inhibitor can be prepared for administration, either together or separately. Any suitable route of administration may be used for each component, including but not limited to oral, parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, transdermal, topical and subcutaneous routes. The two substances used together (PARP inhibitor and therapeutic agent) may be administered separately or together. When administered together, they may be in separate dosage forms, or they may be combined into a single combination drug. Thus, provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutic agent as described herein and at least one PARP inhibitor, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\n\n\nThe following examples illustrate and do not limit the invention.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nProcesses for Synthesizing Compounds of Formulae I, II, III and IV\n\n\n \nProcess\n 1\n\n\n3-bromo-4-pyridine carboxylic acid (3.0 g, 14.9 mmol) in ethanol (100 mL) was treated with concentrated sulfuric acid (5 mL).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe mixture was brought to reflux at which time everything went into solution.

Modulatory activity of compounds described herein also are assessed in vitro in cell-free PARP assays. These assays are described hereafter.\n\n\nCK2 Assay\n\n\nTest compounds in aqueous solution were added at a volume of 10 microliters, to a reaction mixture comprising 10 microliters Assay Dilution Buffer (ADB; 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mM beta-glycerolphosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and 1 mM dithiothreitol), 10 microliters of substrate peptide (RRRDDDSDDD, dissolved in ADB at a concentration of 1 mM), 10 microliters of recombinant human CK2 (25 ng dissolved in ADB; Upstate). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 microliters of ATP Solution (90% 75 mM MgCl\n2\n, 75 micromolar ATP dissolved in ADB; 10% [γ-\n33\nP]ATP (\nstock\n 1 mCi/100 μl; 3000 Ci/mmol (Perkin Elmer) and maintained for 10 minutes at 30 degrees C. The reactions were quenched with 100 microliters of 0.75% phosphoric acid, then transferred to and filtered through a phosphocellulose filter plate (Millipore). After washing each well 5 times with 0.75% phosphoric acid, the plate was dried under vacuum for 5 min and, following the addition of 15 ul of scintilation fluid to each well, the residual radioactivity was measured using a Wallac luminescence counter.\n\n\nPARP Assay\n\n\nPARP assays are conducted using a chemiluminescent PARP assay kit (Trevigen). Briefly, reactions are performed in Histone-coated strip wells, by adding 10 microliters test compound dissolved in 1×PARP Buffer (prepared by mixing 20×PARP buffer diluted with high-purity water) and 15 microliters diluted PARP-HSA enzyme (diluted in 1×PARP buffer, 0.1 unit per well) to 25 microliters PARP cocktail (prepared from 10×PARP cocktail and 10× activated DNA, both 2.5 microliters per well and 20 microliters per well of 1×PARP buffer). The reactions are incubated at ambient temperature for 60 minutes, then the liquid was removed. After washing the wells four times with PBS (200 ul), 50 microliters of STREP-HRP (Horseradish Peroxidase) solution (diluted 500-fold in 1× Strep-Diluent) was added and the reactions were allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at ambient temperature. The liquid was removed and, after washing the wells four times with PBS (200 ul), 50 microliters each of PeroxyGlo A and B (Chemiluminescent Horseradish Peroxidase substrates) are added and the resulting chemiluminescence quantified on the SpectraMax M5 plate reader.\n\n\nTables 10 to 15 show modulatory effects of compounds on CK2 activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 ng/ml Geutamycin. Before treatment cells were washed, resuspended at a density of about 10\n6 \ncells/milliliter in medium containing 1% fetal calf serum and incubated in the presence of indicated mounts of drug for two hours. Cells were recovered by centrifugation, lysed using a hypotonic buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4; 2 mM EDTA; 5 mM EGTA; 10 mM mercaptoethanol; 10 mM NaF; 1 uM Okadaic acid; 10% v/v glycerol; 0.05% NP-40; 1% Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) and protein from the cleared lysate was diluted to 1 microgram per microliter in Assay Dilution Buffer (ADB; 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mM β-glycerolphosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and 1 mM dithiothreitol). To 20 microliters of diluted protein was added 10 microliters of substrate peptide (RRRDDDSDDD, dissolved in ADB at a concentration of 1 mM) and 10 microliters of PKA Inhibitor cocktail (Upstate). Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 microliters of ATP Solution (90% 75 mM MgCl\n2\n, 100 uM ATP dissolved in ADB; 10% [gamma-\n33\nP]ATP (\nstock\n 1 mCi/100 microliters; 3000 Ci/mmol (Perkin Elmer)) and maintained for 15 min at 32 degrees C. The reactions were quenched with 100 microliters of 0.75% phosphoric acid, then transferred to and filtered through a phosphocellulose filter plate (Millipore). After washing each well 5 times with 0.75% phosphoric acid, the residual radioactivity was measured using a Wallac luminescence counter.\n\n\nModulatory activities of two compounds assessed by the assay are shown in \nFIG. 1\n.

Blood samples were collected at predetermined times and the plasma separated. Plasma was separated from the blood samples collected at 5, 15 and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours post-dose.\n\n\nDrug levels were quantified by the LC/MS/MS method described below. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was applied for intravenous administration. A linear trapezoidal rule was used to compute AUC(0-24). The terminal t\n1/2 \nand C\n0 \nwere calculated using the last three and the first three data points, respectively\n\n\nBioanalysis was performed using a Quattro Micro LC/MS/MS instrument in the MRM detection mode, with an internal standard (IS). Briefly, 15 □L plasma samples were prepared for analysis using protein precipitation with 120 μL of acetonitrile. The supernatants were transferred into a 96 well plate and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using a Phenomenex Polar-RP HPLC column. The mobile phases were 10 mM NH\n4\nHCO\n3 \nin water (Solution-A) and 10 mM NH\n4\nHCO\n3 \nin methanol (Solution-B). The column was initially equilibrated with 25% Solution-B and followed with 100% Solution B over 5 minutes. The method had a dynamic range from 1 to 10,000 ng/mL. Quantitation of the analytes was performed in the batch mode with two bracketing calibration curves according to the bioanalytical sample list.\n\n\nPharmacokinetic profiles and estimated pharmacokinetic parameters of compound A1 below are shown in \nFIG. 2A\n and in Table 21.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated pharmacokinetic parameters after intravenous and oral dosing at\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 and 25 mg/kg, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPK Parameter\n\n\nIV\n\n\n \nPO\n \n \nUnits\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDose\n \n \n \n \n\n\n5\n\n\n25\n\n\nmg/kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAUC\n(0-8 h)\n \n\n\n2910\n\n\n1580\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAUC\n(0-24 h)\n \n\n\n3337\n\n\n2915\n\n\nng · h · mh\n−1\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAUC\n(0-Inf)\n \n\n\n3364\n\n\n3149\n\n\nng · h · ml\n−1\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCmax-obs\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n343\n\n\nng/mL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCp0-exp\n\n\n13201\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nng/mL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTmax\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n0.25\n\n\nhr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKel\n\n\n0.1586\n\n\n0.1076\n\n\nhr\n−1\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nt\n½\n \n\n\n4.4\n\n\n6.4\n\n\nhr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVd\n\n\n9.4\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nL/kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCL\ns\n \n\n\n1.5\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nL/kg/hr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nF(0-8 h)\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n10.9\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nF(0-inf h)\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n18.7\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetic profiles and estimated pharmacokinetic parameters of the test compound below are shown in \nFIG. 2B\n and Table 22.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nA2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated pharmacokinetic parameters after aIV and PO dose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPK\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nParameter\n\n\nIV\n\n\nPO\n\n\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDose\n\n\n3.4\n\n\n24.5\n\n\nmg/kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAUC\n(0-8 h)\n \n\n\n3716\n\n\n6005\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAUC\n(0-24 h)\n \n\n\n4806\n\n\n9120\n\n\nng · h · ml\n−1\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAUC\n(0-Inf)\n \n\n\n4898\n\n\n10895\n\n\nng · h · ml\n−1\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCmax-obs\n\n\n4744\n\n\n1600.5\n\n\nng/mL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCp0-exp\n\n\n5631\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nng/mL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTmax\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nhr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKel\n\n\n0.1418\n\n\n0.0594\n\n\nhr\n−1\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nt\n½\n \n\n\n4.9\n\n\n11.7\n\n\nhr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVd\n\n\n4.9\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nL/kg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCL\ns\n \n\n\n0.7\n\n\nN/A\n\n\nL/kg/hr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nF\n(0-24 h)\n \n\n\nN/A\n\n\n26.5\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nF\n(0-Inf)\n \n\n\nN/A\n\n\n31.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\nEvaluation of Compound Efficacy in Tumor Suppression\n\n\nThe in vivo activity of compound A1 and compound A2 (shown previously) was assessed by intravenous and oral administration to tumor-bearing xenograft mice. The in vivo experiments followed protocols approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee. Female NCr nu/nu mice were purchased from Taconic Farms and group housed in a ventilated rack system on a 12/12 light cycle. All housing materials and water were autoclaved prior to use. The mice were fed ad libitum with gamma irradiated laboratory chow and acidified water. Animals were handled under laminar-flow hoods.\n\n\nTumor size (mm\n3\n) was calculated using the formula (l×w\n2\n)/2, where w=width and l=length in mm of the tumor. Tumor weight was estimated with the assumption that 1 mg is equivalent to 1 mm\n3 \nof tumor volume.\n\n\nFor intravenous administration of compound A1, animals were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with 5×10\n6 \nMiaPaca cells. Tumors were monitored twice weekly and then daily as they approached the appropriate size for study. On \nDay\n 1 of the study, the animals were randomized into n=5 treatment groups with group mean tumor sizes of 160 mm\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGrp\n 1\n \nMean\n \n160.966\n \n \nUTC\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGrp\n \n \n \n 2\n \nMean\n \n161.816\n \n \nGemzar\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGrp\n \n \n \n 3\n \nMean\n \n161.807\n \n30 mg/kg \nCK2 Compound\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGrp\n \n \n \n 4\n \nMean\n \n159.621\n \n60 mg/kg CK2 Compound\n \n \n \n \n \n% Dif.\n \n \n \n1.363\n \n \n \n \n \nSD\n \n \n \n1.034.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAnimals received 14 doses of Vehicle, Gemzar at 100 mg/kg Q3D or compound A1 at either 30 mg/kg or 60 mg/kg by QD intravenous administration. Tumor volume measurements (\nFIG. 3A\n) and body weight (\nFIG. 3B\n) were recorded on \n \n \n \n \ndays\n \n \n \n \n 3, 6, 8, 10, 13 and 15. Photographs of specific untreated control animals and animals administered 60 mg/kg compound A1 are shown in \nFIGS. 3C and 3D\n. Compound A1 is referred to as “CK2 inhibitor” in \nFIGS. 3A\n, \n3\nB, \n3\nC and \n3\nD.\n\n\n\nCompound A1 also was administered orally to MiaPaca xenograft animals and inhibited tumor growth. Compound A1 was formulated as a sodium salt at 10 mg/mL with 2% PEG 300 and buffered to pH 8.4 using sodium phosphate buffer. Compound A1 when administered orally to the animals at a dose of 100 mg/kg QDx8 and then 200 mg/kg QDx5 significantly inhibited tumor growth relative to an untreated control group. Gemzar™ administered at a dose of 80 mg/kg IP Q3D was used as a positive control. Compound A1 also was delivered by oral administration at 100 mg/kg to animals bearing MCF-7 xenografts and at 150 mg/kg to animals bearing PC-3 xenografts, and in both sets of studies, significantly inhibited tumor growth.\n\n\nIt also was determined that compound A1 reduced CK2 activity in tumors. Assessment of CK2 activity in tumors revealed that tumors from animals treated with compound A1 had about 40% of the CK2 activity of tumors from animals not treated with compound A1 or treated with Gemzar™.\n\n\nThe distribution of compound A1 in the plasma and tumors of animals was assessed. In animals administered 30 mg/kg compound A1 IV, 60 mg/kg compound A1 IV and 200 mg/kg compound A1 orally, about 6.8, 2.2 and 9.5 micromolar compound A1, respectively, was identified in plasma, and about 42.9, 7.0 and 6.4 micromolar compound A1, respectively, was identified in tumors.\n\n\nCaspase staining also was assessed as a biomarker for compound A1 treatment of tumors. In animals treated with 60 mg/kg of compound A1 by IV administration, caspase-3 cell staining levels were four-fold greater than in untreated control cells. These results suggest caspase-3 staining can be a useful biomarker for monitoring inhibition of cell proliferation and tumor inhibition.\n\n\nFor assessment of compound A2, the compound was delivered by intravenous and intraperitoneal administration to tumor-bearing xenograft mice. Animals were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with 5×10\n6 \nBC-PC3 cells. Tumors were monitored twice weekly and then daily as they approached the appropriate size for study. On \nDay\n 1 of the study, the animals were randomized into n=8 treatment groups (n=5 for positive and negative control groups) with group mean tumor sizes of 97 mm\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGrp\n 1\n \nMean\n \n97.80\n \n \nUTC\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGrp\n \n \n \n 2\n \nMean\n \n96.95\n \n \nGemzar Q3D\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGrp\n \n \n \n 3\n \nMean\n \n96.68\n \n 50 mg/kg CX-5011 IV BID \nx10 days\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGrp\n \n \n \n 4\n \nMean\n \n98.95\n \n 60 mg/kg CX-5011 IV QD \nx17 days\n \n \n \n \n \n \nGrp\n \n \n \n 5\n \nMean\n \n96.51\n \n100 mg/kg CX-5011 IP BID x17 days\n \n \n \n \n \n% Dif\n \n \n \n2.50\n \n \n \n \n \nSD\n \n \n \n1.01\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nAnimals received 17 doses of Vehicle, Gemzar at 100 mg/kg Q3D or compound at either 60 mg/kg QD intravenous administration or 100 mg/kg BID intraperitoneal administration.

Tumor volume measurements and body weight were recorded on \n \n \n \n \ndays\n \n \n \n \n 1, 4, 7, 11, 13, 15, and 18, and data showed compound A2 significantly inhibited tumor progression (\nFIG. 4A\n) while not significantly altering body weight (\nFIG. 4B\n). Delivery of compound A2 to animals bearing MiaPaca xenografts by IV administration at 50 and 60 mg/kg and by IP administration at 100 mg/kg significantly inhibited tumor progression. Also, delivery of compound A2 to animals bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts by IV administration at 30 and 60 mg/kg and by oral administration at 200 mg/kg significantly inhibited tumor progression. Delivery of compound A2 to animals bearing MiaPaca xenografts by oral administration at 100 mg/kg QDx8 and 200 mg/kg QDx6 significantly inhibited tumor progression. A meglumine salt of compound A2 at pH 10.0 and at 10 mg/mL was utilized as an oral formulation for the studies.\n\n\n\nTumor pharmacokinetic studies of compound A2 were carried out in which 30 mg/kg of the compound was dosed IV QDx6. Plasma, blood and tumor samples were taken on \n \n \nday\n \n \n 1, 4 and 6 and three animals sacrificed for each time point. Steady state was reached after about three days, the terminal slope decreases, the half life about doubles, the minimum concentration was 4-5 times higher after six days and there were no significant differences between \n \nday\n \n 4 and 6.\n\n\nDelivery of compound A3 to animals bearing MiaPaca xenografts by IV administration also significantly inhibited tumor progression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\nModulation of Non-CK2 Protein Kinase Activity\n\n\nCompounds described herein are profiled for in vitro modulatory activity against protein kinases other than CK2. The in vitro analysis is conducted using known protocols (e.g., assay protocols described at world-wide web address upstate.com/img/pdf/KP Assay Protocol_Booklet_v3.pdf). Compounds described herein are screened in the assays and prioritized based upon modulatory activity against protein kinases other than CK2 and specificity for CK2 or PARP.\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\nEvaluation of Angiogenesis Inhibition by Endothelial Tube Formation Assay\n\n\nA human endothelial tube formation assay was performed using the 96-well BD BioCoat™ Angiogenesis System from BD Biosciences, using the manufacturer's recommended protocol.\n\n\nBriefly, HUVEC cells (from ATCC) were suspended in 150 ul of media containing 10% FBS at 4×10\n5 \ncells/ml in each of the 96-wells of the matrigel coated plate in the presence or absence of various concentrations of compound A2. The plate was incubated for 18 hrs at 37° C. The cells were stained with calcein AM and the results visualized by fluorescent microscopy or by phase contrast. It was observed that compound A2 inhibited tube formation in the assay described above over a concentration range of 1 to 5 μM.\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\nModulation of Protein Kinase Activity in Cell-Free In Vitro Assay\n\n\nIn a PIM-1 assay, test compounds in aqueous solution are added at a volume of 5 ul, to a reaction mixture comprising 5 ul of 5× Reaction buffer (40 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA), 2.5 ul of recombinant human PIM-1 solution (10 ng), 2.5 ul of substrate peptide (KKRNRTLTK) and 10 ul of ATP solution—98% (75 mM MgCl2 37.5 uM ATP) 2% ([γ-33P]ATP: 3000 Ci/mmol—Perkin Elmer). The reactions are incubated for 10 min at 30° C., quenched with 100 ul of 0.75% Phosphoric acid, then transferred to and filtered through a Phosphocellulose filter plate (Millipore). After washing each well 5 times with 0.75% Phosphoric acid, Scintilation fluid (15 ul) is added to each well. The residual radioactivity is measured using a luminescence counter. Compound A2 inhibited PIM-1 with IC\n50\n=189 nM.\n\n\nCompound A2 was tested further for its activity against other protein kinases. The following kinase inhibition IC\n50 \ndata were determined using standardized radiometric kinase assays for each individual kinase, which entail filter binding of \n33\nP labeled substrate proteins by the kinase of interest. Each IC\n50 \nvalue was determined over a range of 10 drug concentrations.
