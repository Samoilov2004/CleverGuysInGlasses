No. 60/932,100 likewise bearing the same title as that of the present application and filed May 29, 2007; and the disclosures of all such applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. Applicants claim the benefits of such applications under 35 U.S.C. §119(e).\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to a class of triazolopyrazine compounds capable of binding to the active site of a serine/threonine kinase, the expression of which is involved in the pathway resulting in the degradation of extra-cellular matrix (ECM), joint degeneration and diseases involving such degradation and/or inflammation.\n\n\nDiseases involving the degradation of extra-cellular matrix include, but are not limited to, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile arthritis, early arthritis, reactive arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoporosis, muskulo skeletal diseases like tendonitis and periodontal disease, cancer metastasis, airway diseases (COPD, asthma), renal and liver fibrosis, cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis and heart failure, and neurological diseases like neuroinflammation and multiple sclerosis. Diseases involving primarily joint degeneration include, but are not limited to, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile arthritis, early arthritis, reactive arthritis, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.\n\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic joint degenerative disease, characterized by inflammation and destruction of the joint structures. When the disease is unchecked, it leads to substantial disability and pain due to loss of joint functionality and even premature death. The aim of an RA therapy, therefore, is not to slow down the disease but to attain remission in order to stop the joint destruction. Besides the severity of the disease outcome, the high prevalence of RA (˜0.8% of adults are affected worldwide) means a high socioeconomic impact. (For reviews on RA, we refer to Smolen and Steiner (2003); Lee and Weinblatt (2001); Choy and Panayi (2001); O'Dell (2004) and Firestein (2003)).\n\n\nAlthough it is widely accepted that RA is an auto-immune disease, there is no consensus concerning the precise mechanisms driving the ‘initiation stage’ of the disease. What is known is that the initial trigger(s) does mediate, in a predisposed host, a cascade of events that leads to the activation of various cell types (B-cells, T-cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, dendritic cells and others). Concomitantly, an increased production of various cytokines is observed in the joints and tissues surrounding the joint (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1, IL-15, IL-18 and others). When the disease progresses, the cellular activation and cytokine production cascade becomes self-perpetuating. At this early stage, the destruction of joint structures is already very clear at this early stage. Thirty percent of the patients have radiographic evidence of bony erosions at the time of diagnosis and this proportion increases to 60 percent after two years.\n\n\nHistological analysis of the joints of RA patients clearly evidences the mechanisms involved in the RA-associated degradative processes. This analysis shows that the main effector responsible for RA-associated joint degradation is the pannus, where the synovial fibroblast, by producing diverse proteolytic enzymes, is the prime driver of cartilage and bone erosion. A joint classically contains two adjacent bones that articulate on a cartilage layer and are surrounded by the synovial membrane and joint capsule. In the advanced RA patient, the synovium of joint increases in size to form the pannus, due to the proliferation of the synovial fibroblasts and the infiltration of mononuclear cells such as T-cells, B-cells, monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. The pannus mediates the degradation of the adjacent cartilage, leading to the narrowing of the joint space, and has the potential to invade adjacent bone and cartilage. As bone and cartilage tissues are composed mainly of collagen type I or II, respectively, the pannus destructive and invasive properties are mediated by the secretion of collagenolytic proteases, principally the matrix metallo proteinases (MMPs). The erosion of the bone under and adjacent to the cartilage is also part of the RA process, and results principally from the presence of osteoclasts at the interface of bone and pannus. Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells that, upon adhesion to the bone tissue, form a closed compartment, within which the osteoclasts secrete proteases (Cathepsin K, MMP9) that degrade the bone tissue. The osteoclast population in the joint is abnormally increased by osteoblast formation from precursor cells induced by the secretion of the receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) by activated SFs and T-cells.\n\n\nVarious collagen types have a key role in defining the stability of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Collagens type I and collagen type II, for example, are the main components of bone and cartilage, respectively. Collagen proteins typically organise into multimeric structures referred to as collagen fibrils. Native collagen fibrils are very resistant to proteolytic cleavage. Only a few types of ECM-degrading proteins have been reported to have the capacity to degrade native collagen: MMPs and Cathepsins. Among the Cathepsins, cathepsin K, which is active mainly in osteoclasts, is the best characterised. Among the MMPs, MMP1, MMP2, MMP8 MMP13 and MMP14 are known to have collagenolytic properties. The correlation between an increased expression of MMP1 by synovial fibroblasts (SFs) and the progression of the arthritic disease is well-established and is predictive for joint erosive processes (Cunnane et al., 2001). In the context of RA, therefore, MMP1 represents a highly relevant collagen degrading protein. In vitro, the treatment of cultured SFs with cytokines relevant in the RA pathology (e.g. TNF-α and IL1β) will increase the expression of MMP1 by these cells (Andreakos et al., 2003). Monitoring the levels of MMP1 expressed by SFs therefore is a relevant readout in the field of RA as it is indicative for the activation of SFs towards an erosive phenotype that, in vivo, is responsible for cartilage degradation. Inhibition of the MMP1 expression by SFs represents a valuable therapeutic approach towards the treatment of RA.\n\n\nThe activity of the ECM-degrading proteins can also be causative or correlate with the progression of various diseases different from RA, as e.g. other diseases that involve the degradation of the joints. These diseases include, but are not limited to, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile arthritis, early arthritis, reactive arthritis, osteoarthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Other diseases that may be treatable with compounds identified according to the present invention and using the targets involved in the expression of MMPs as described herein are osteoporosis, muscular skeletal diseases like tendonitis and periodontal disease (Gapski et al., 2004), cancer metastasis (Coussens et al., 2002), airway diseases (COPD, asthma) (Suzuki et al., 2004), lung, renal fibrosis (Schanstra et al., 2002), liver fibrosis associated with chronic hepatitis C (Reiff et al., 2005), cardio-vascular diseases like atherosclerosis and heart failure (Creemers et al., 2001), and neurological diseases like neuroinflammation and multiple sclerosis (Rosenberg, 2002). Patients suffering from such diseases may benefit from stabilizing the ECM (by protecting it from degradation).\n\n\nThe 471-amino acid serine/threonine kinase identified as Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase-Activated Protein Kinase 5 (MAPKAPK5 or PRAK) is expressed in a wide panel of tissues. The protein contains its catalytic domain at the N-terminal end and both a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES) at its C-terminal end. Endogenous MAPKAPK5 is predominantly present in the cytoplasm, but stress or cytokine activation of the cells mediates its translocation into the nucleus (New et al., 2003). This event is dependent on phosphorylation of MAPKAPK5. Thr182 is the regulatory phosphorylation site of MAPKAPK5. Although the p38α kinase is able to phosphorylate MAPKAPK5 in an overexpression setting, experiments with endogenous MAPKAPK5 do not support this hypothesis (Shi et al., 2003). MAPKAPK5 knock-out mice have been generated that are viable and fertile. The phenotype of these mice is quite different from that of mice deficient for MAPKAPK2, a MAPKAPK5 related kinase that is regulated by p38α (Shi et al., 2003). This indicates that the function of each protein is distinct and that neither kinase can compensate for the other's activity. Taken together, MAPKAPK5 and MAPKAPK2 represent distinct targets with a non-redundant role. MAPK6 (also referred to as ERK3) has recently been identified as a physiologically relevant substrate for MAPKAPK5, defining a novel signal transduction pathway (Seternes et al., 2004).\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nNSAIDS (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are used to reduce the pain associated with RA and improve life quality of the patients. These drugs will not, however, put a brake on the RA-associated joint destruction.\n\n\nCorticosteroids were found to decrease the progression of RA as detected radiographically and are used at low doses to treat part of the RA patients (30 to 60%). Serious side effects, however, are associated with long corticosteroid use (Skin thinning, osteoporosis, cataracts, hypertension, hyperlipidemia).\n\n\nSynthetic DMARDs (Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs) (e.g. methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine) mainly tackle the immuno-inflammatory component of RA. As a main disadvantage, these drugs only have a limited efficacy (joint destruction is only slowed down but not blocked by DMARDs such that disease progression in the long term continues). The lack of efficacy is indicated by the fact that, on average, only 30% of the patients achieve an ACR40 score after 24 months treatment with methotrexate. This means that, according to the American College of Rheumatology, only 30% of the patients do achieve a 50% improvement of their symptoms (O'Dell et al., 1996). In addition, the precise mechanism of action of DMARDs is often unclear.\n\n\nBiological DMARDs (Infliximab, Etanercept, Adalimumab, Rituximab, CTLA4-Ig) are therapeutic proteins that do inactivate cytokines (e.g. TNF-α) or cells (e.g. T-cells or B-cells) that have an important role in the RA pathophysiology (Kremer et al., 2003; Edwards et al., 2004). Although the TNF-α-blockers (Infliximab, Etanercept, Adalimumab) and methotrexate combination therapy is the most effective RA treatment currently available, it is striking that even this therapy only achieves a 50% improvement (ACR40) in disease symptoms in 50-60% of patients after 12 months therapy (St Clair et al., 2004). Some adverse events warnings for anti-TNF-α drugs exist, shedding a light on the side effects associated to this type of drugs. Increased risk for infections (tuberculosis) hematologic events and demyelinating disorders have been described for the TNF-α blockers (see also Gomez-Reino et al., 2003). Besides the serious side effects, the TNF-α blockers do also share the general disadvantages of the biological class of therapeutics, which are the unpleasant way of administration (frequent injections accompanied by infusion site reactions) and the high production cost. Newer agents in late development phase target T-cell co-stimulatory molecules and B-cells. The efficacy of these agents is expected to be similar to that of the TNF-α blockers. The fact that a variety of targeted therapies have similar but limited efficacies, suggests that there is a multiplicity of pathogenic factors for RA. This is also indicative for the deficiencies in our understanding of pathogenic events relevant to RA.\n\n\nThe current therapies for RA are not satisfactory due to a limited efficacy (No adequate therapy exists for 30% of the patients). This calls for additional strategies to achieve remission. Remission is required since residual disease bears the risk of progressive joint damage and thus progressive disability. Inhibiting the immuno-inflammatory component of the RA disease, which represents the main target of drugs currently used for RA treatment, does not result in a blockade of joint degradation, the major hallmark of the disease.\n\n\nUS 2005/0009832 describes substituted [1.2.4]triazolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-8-yl-amines as modulators of protein kinases, including MAPKAPK5.

Such salts include: (1) acid addition salts, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; or formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, hexanoic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 1,2-ethane-disulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 4-toluenesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, 4-methylbicyclo[2.2.2]-oct-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid, glucoheptonic acid, 3-phenylpropionic acid, trimethylacetic acid, tertiary butylacetic acid, lauryl sulfuric acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, hydroxynaphthoic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, muconic acid, and the like; or (2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, N-methylglucamine and the like. Salts further include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like; and when the compound contains a basic functionality, salts of non toxic organic or inorganic acids, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, tartrate, mesylate, acetate, maleate, oxalate and the like. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable cation” refers to a non toxic, acceptable cationic counter-ion of an acidic functional group. Such cations are exemplified by sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium cations, and the like.\n\n\n“Pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle” refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient or carrier with which a compound of the invention is administered.\n\n\n“Preventing” or “prevention” refers to a reduction in risk of acquiring a disease or disorder (i.e., causing at least one of the clinical symptoms of the disease not to develop in a subject that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease).\n\n\n“Prodrugs” refers to compounds, including derivatives of the compounds of the invention, which have cleavable groups and become by solvolysis or under physiological conditions the compounds of the invention which are pharmaceutically active in vivo. Such examples include, but are not limited to, choline ester derivatives and the like, N-alkylmorpholine esters and the like.\n\n\n“Subject” includes humans. The terms “human,” “patient” and “subject” are used interchangeably herein.\n\n\n“Treating” or “treatment” of any disease or disorder refers, in one embodiment, to ameliorating the disease or disorder (i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the disease or at least one of the clinical symptoms thereof). In another embodiment “treating” or “treatment” refers to ameliorating at least one physical parameter, which may not be discernible by the subject. In yet another embodiment, “treating” or “treatment” refers to modulating the disease or disorder, either physically, (e.g., stabilization of a discernible symptom), physiologically, (e.g., stabilization of a physical parameter), or both. In yet another embodiment, “treating” or “treatment” refers to delaying the onset of the disease or disorder.\n\n\nOther derivatives of the compounds of this invention have activity in both their acid and acid derivative forms, but in the acid sensitive form often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility, or delayed release in the mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985). Prodrugs include acid derivatives well know to practitioners of the art, such as, for example, esters prepared by reaction of the parent acid with a suitable alcohol, or amides prepared by reaction of the parent acid compound with a substituted or unsubstituted amine, or acid anhydrides, or mixed anhydrides. Simple aliphatic or aromatic esters, amides and anhydrides derived from acidic groups pendant on the compounds of this invention are preferred prodrugs. In some cases it is desirable to prepare double ester type prodrugs such as (acyloxy)alkyl esters or ((alkoxycarbonyl)oxy)alkylesters. Preferred are the C\n1 \nto C\n8 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n8 \nalkenyl, aryl, C\n7\n-C\n12 \nsubstituted aryl, and C\n7\n-C\n12 \narylalkyl esters of the compounds of the invention.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “isotopic variant” refers to a compound that contains unnatural proportions of isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compound. For example, an “isotopic variant” of a compound can contain one or more non-radioactive isotopes, such as for example, deuterium (\n2\nH or D), carbon-13 (\n13\nC), nitrogen-15 (\n15\nN), or the like. It will be understood that, in a compound where such isotopic substitution is made, the following atoms, where present, may vary, so that for example, any hydrogen may be \n2\nH/D, any carbon may be \n13\nC, or any nitrogen may be \n15\nN, and that the presence and placement of such atoms may be determined within the skill of the art. Likewise, the invention may include the preparation of isotopic variants with radioisotopes, in the instance for example, where the resulting compounds may be used for drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. \n3\nH, and carbon-14, i.e. \n14\nC, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Further, compounds may be prepared that are substituted with positron emitting isotopes, such as \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n15\nO and \n13\nN, and would be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.\n\n\nAll isotopic variants of the compounds provided herein, radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the invention.\n\n\nIt is also to be understood that compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “isomers”. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “stereoisomers”.\n\n\nStereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed “diastereomers” and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed “enantiomers”. When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (−)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a “racemic mixture”.\n\n\n“Tautomers” refer to compounds that are interchangeable forms of a particular compound structure, and that vary in the displacement of hydrogen atoms and electrons. Thus, two structures may be in equilibrium through the movement of π electrons and an atom (usually H). For example, enols and ketones are tautomers because they are rapidly interconverted by treatment with either acid or base. Another example of tautomerism is the aci- and nitro-forms of phenylnitromethane, that are likewise formed by treatment with acid or base.\n\n\nTautomeric forms may be relevant to the attainment of the optimal chemical reactivity and biological activity of a compound of interest.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric centers; such compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof. Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art.\n\n\nThe Compounds\n\n\nThe present invention is based on the discovery of that MAPKAPK5 functions in the pathway that results in the expression of MMP1, and that inhibitors of MAPKAPK5 activity, such as the compounds of the present invention, are useful for the treatment of diseases involving the abnormally high expression of MMP activity.\n\n\nThe present matrix metallo proteinase inhibiting compounds of the present invention may be described generally as [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrazine-8-yl-amines substituted in the 5-position by an aryl and heteroaryl group, and an in the 8-position by an arylamino or a heteroarylamino group.\n\n\nMore particularly, the present invention relates to compounds having matrix metallo proteinase inhibiting properties in a mammalian cell, according to formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein:\n\n \n \nA and B are independently CR2R″, NR″, oxygen or sulphur;\n \nAA is CR2 or N;\n \nD is C═O, CR2R″ or NR″;\n \nE is NH or CR″R6, when k is zero, and is NH or CR″R6a, when k is one;\n \nF is sulphur, oxygen or NH;\n \nT is oxygen or NR;\n \nU, V, W and X are independently CR″R7 or NR″;\n \nY is CR″ or N;\n \nZ is hydrogen, amino, hydroxyl, lower alkoxy, carbamoyl, carboxyl, SO\n2\nRz, SO\n2\nNRRz, —NR(CO)(CH2)d-Rz, —NRRz, —(CO)—ORz, —(CO)—NR(CH2)d-Rz, or\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nR is independently hydrogen or lower alkyl;\n\n\nR″ is H or forms a double bond with an adjacent atom;\n\n\nR1 is H;

Prodrugs are derivatives of the compounds of the invention, which have metabolically cleavable groups and become by solvolysis or under physiological conditions the compounds of the invention, which are pharmaceutically active, in vivo. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject but is converted in vivo to an active compound of the invention. “Pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs” as used herein refers to those prodrugs of the compounds useful in the present invention, which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of patients with undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use of the compounds of the invention. The term “prodrug” means a compound that is transformed in vivo to yield an effective compound useful in the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof. The transformation may occur by various mechanisms, such as through hydrolysis in blood. The compounds bearing metabolically cleavable groups have the advantage that they may exhibit improved bioavailability as a result of enhanced solubility and/or rate of absorption conferred upon the parent compound by virtue of the presence of the metabolically cleavable group, thus, such compounds act as pro-drugs.

Roche, ed., American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, which are incorporated herein by reference. Such examples include, but are not limited to, choline ester derivatives and the like, N-alkylmorpholine esters and the like.\n\n\nOther derivatives of the compounds of this invention have activity in both their acid and acid derivative forms, but the acid sensitive form often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility, or delayed release in the mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985). Prodrugs include acid derivatives well know to practitioners of the art, such as, for example, esters prepared by reaction of the parent acid with a suitable alcohol, or amides prepared by reaction of the parent acid compound with a substituted or unsubstituted amine, or acid anhydrides, or mixed anhydrides. Simple aliphatic or aromatic esters, amides and anhydrides derived from acidic groups pendant on the compounds of this invention are preferred prodrugs. In some cases it is desirable to prepare double ester type prodrugs such as (acyloxy)alkyl esters or ((alkoxycarbonyl)oxy)alkylesters. Preferred are the C\n1 \nto C\n8 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n8 \nalkenyl, aryl, C\n7\n-C\n12 \nsubstituted aryl, and C\n7\n-C\n12 \narylalkyl esters of the compounds of the invention.\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\nWhen employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of this invention are typically administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Such compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one active compound.\n\n\nGenerally, the compounds of this invention are administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. The amount of the compound actually administered will typically be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound-administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered by a variety of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and intranasal. Depending on the intended route of delivery, the compounds of this invention are preferably formulated as either injectable or oral compositions or as salves, as lotions or as patches all for transdermal administration.\n\n\nThe compositions for oral administration can take the form of bulk liquid solutions or suspensions, or bulk powders. More commonly, however, the compositions are presented in unit dosage forms to facilitate accurate dosing. The term “unit dosage forms” refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Typical unit dosage forms include prefilled, premeasured ampules or syringes of the liquid compositions or pills, tablets, capsules or the like in the case of solid compositions. In such compositions, the furansulfonic acid compound is usually a minor component (from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight or preferably from about 1 to about 40% by weight) with the remainder being various vehicles or carriers and processing aids helpful for forming the desired dosing form.\n\n\nLiquid forms suitable for oral administration may include a suitable aqueous or nonaqueous vehicle with buffers, suspending and dispensing agents, colorants, flavors and the like. Solid forms may include, for example, any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.\n\n\nInjectable compositions are typically based upon injectable sterile saline or phosphate-buffered saline or other injectable carriers known in the art. As before, the active compound in such compositions is typically a minor component, often being from about 0.05 to 10% by weight with the remainder being the injectable carrier and the like.\n\n\nTransdermal compositions are typically formulated as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s), generally in an amount ranging from about 0.01 to about 20% by weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 20% by weight, preferably from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight, and more preferably from about 0.5 to about 15% by weight. When formulated as a ointment, the active ingredients will typically be combined with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with, for example an oil-in-water cream base. Such transdermal formulations are well-known in the art and generally include additional ingredients to enhance the dermal penetration of stability of the active ingredients or the formulation. All such known transdermal formulations and ingredients are included within the scope of this invention.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention can also be administered by a transdermal device. Accordingly, transdermal administration can be accomplished using a patch either of the reservoir or porous membrane type, or of a solid matrix variety.\n\n\nThe above-described components for orally administrable, injectable or topically administrable compositions are merely representative. Other materials as well as processing techniques and the like are set forth in \nPart\n 8 of \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n17th edition, 1985, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention can also be administered in sustained release forms or from sustained release drug delivery systems. A description of representative sustained release materials can be found in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. \n \n\n\nThe following formulation examples illustrate representative pharmaceutical compositions of this invention. The present invention, however, is not limited to the following pharmaceutical compositions.\n\n\nFormulation 1—Tablets\n\n\nA compound of the invention is admixed as a dry powder with a dry gelatin binder in an approximate 1:2 weight ratio.

Accordingly, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of this invention find use as therapeutics for preventing and/or treating inflammatory diseases in mammals including humans.\n\n\nIn a method of treatment aspect, this invention provides a method of treating a mammal susceptible to or afflicted with a condition associated with extra-cellular matrix (ECM) degradation, in particular arthritis, and more particularly, rheumatoid arthritis, which method comprises administering an effective amount of one or more of the compounds of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition just described.\n\n\nIn another method of treatment aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a mammal susceptible to or afflicted with a condition associated with an abnormal cellular expression of MMP1, which comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof.\n\n\nIn another method of treatment aspect, the present invention provides a method of treatment or prophylaxis of a condition characterized by abnormal matrix metallo proteinase activity, which comprises administering a therapeutically effective matrix metallo proteinase inhibiting amount of one or more of the compounds of the invention, or pharmaceutical composition thereof.\n\n\nIn yet another method of treatment aspect, this invention provides methods of treating a mammal susceptible to or afflicted with diseases and disorders which are mediated by or result in inflammation such as, for example rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, myocardial infarction, various autoimmune diseases and disorders, uveitis and atherosclerosis; itch/pruritus such as, for example psoriasis; and renal disorders method comprises administering an effective condition-treating or condition-preventing amount of one or more of the pharmaceutical compositions just described.\n\n\nThis invention also relates to the use of the present compounds in the manufacture of a medicament for treatment or prophylaxis of a condition prevented, ameliorated or eliminated by administration of an inhibitor of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase-Activated \nProtein Kinase\n 5, or a condition characterised by abnormal collagenase activity, or a condition associated with ECM degradation or a condition selected from diseases involving inflammation, most preferably in for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\nAs a further aspect of the invention there is provided the present compounds for use as a pharmaceutical especially in the treatment or prevention of the aforementioned conditions and diseases. Also provided herein is the use of the present compounds in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of one of the aforementioned conditions and diseases.\n\n\nA preferred regimen of the present method comprises the administration to a subject in suffering from a disease condition characterized by inflammatory, with an effective matrix metallo-protease inhibiting amount of a compound of the present invention for a period of time sufficient to reduce the abnormal levels of extracellular matrix degradation in the patient, and preferably terminate, the self-perpetuating processes responsible for said degradation. A special embodiment of the method comprises administering of an effective matrix metallo-protease inhibiting amount of a compound of the present invention to a subject patient suffering from or susceptible to the development of rheumatoid arthritis, for a period of time sufficient to reduce or prevent, respectively, collagen and bone degradation in the joints of said patient, and preferably terminate, the self-perpetuating processes responsible for said degradation.\n\n\nInjection dose levels range from about 0.1 mg/kg/hour to at least 10 mg/kg/hour, all for from about 1 to about 120 hours and especially 24 to 96 hours. A preloading bolus of from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg or more may also be administered to achieve adequate steady state levels. The maximum total dose is not expected to exceed about 2 g/day for a 40 to 80 kg human patient.\n\n\nFor the prevention and/or treatment of long-term conditions, such as inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, the regimen for treatment usually extends over many months or years, and accordingly oral dosing is preferred for patient convenience and tolerance. With oral dosing, one to five and especially two to four and typically three oral doses per day are representative regimens. Using these dosing patterns, each dose provides from about 0.01 to about 20 mg/kg of the compound of the invention, with preferred doses each providing from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg and especially about 1 to about 5 mg/kg.\n\n\nTransdermal doses are generally selected to provide similar or lower blood levels than are achieved using injection doses.\n\n\nWhen used to prevent the onset of an inflammatory condition, the compounds of this invention will be administered to a patient at risk for developing the condition, typically on the advice and under the supervision of a physician, at the dosage levels described above. Patients at risk for developing a particular condition generally include those that have a family history of the condition, or those who have been identified by genetic testing or screening to be particularly susceptible to developing the condition.\n\n\nThe compounds of this invention can be administered as the sole active agent or they can be administered in combination with other agents, including other compounds that demonstrate the same or a similar therapeutic activity, and that are determined to safe and efficacious for such combined administration.\n\n\nGeneral Synthetic Procedures\n\n\nThe triazolo[1,5-a]pyridyl compounds of this invention can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.\n\n\nAdditionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group as well as suitable conditions for protection and deprotection are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups, and their introduction and removal, are described in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, \nProtecting Groups in Organic Synthesis\n, Second Edition, Wiley, New York, 1991, and references cited therein.\n\n\nThe following methods are presented with details as to the preparation of representative bicycloheteroaryls that have been listed hereinabove.

Regulators of the Expression of MMP1 by Activated Primary Synovial Fibroblasts\n\n\nTo identify compounds that decrease the ECM-degrading activity of cells, the ECM-degrading activity of cells may be induced to allow proper detection of this activity, and to achieve a clearer read-out. In the context of RA, the cells of choice are mammalian synovial fibroblasts and the triggers that may be used to induce the ECM-degrading activity are cytokines relevant in the field of arthritis: for instance TNF-α, IL1β, IL6, OSM, IL17, and MIF1-α. This list is not comprehensive due to the plethora of cytokines potentially involved in the RA pathogenesis (Smolen and Steiner, 2003). To set up an in vitro assay that is as close as possible to the complexity of the pathology, the trigger applied should be a mixture of factors generated by contacting cytokine-producing cells relevant in the field of arthritis, such as monocytes, macrophages, T-cells, and B-cells, with a trigger. The cytokine-producing cells will respond to the contact by producing a complex and unbiased mixture of factors. If the cytokine-producing cell used is also found in a pannus, and the cytokine applied to produce this trigger is found in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients, the mixture of factors ultimately produced will contain part of the factors that are present in the joints of arthritis patients.\n\n\nPrinciple of the ‘MMP Assay’\n\n\nMatrix Metallo Proteases (MMPs) possess various physiological roles, as e.g. the maturation of other proteases, growth factors, and the degradation of extra-cellular matrix components. MMP1 is one of the members of the MMP family that is able to degrade native collagen, the main component of bone and cartilage. An increased expression of MMP1 by synovial fibroblasts (SFs) is diagnostic for the progression of the arthritic disease and is predictive for erosive processes in the joint (Cunnane et al., 2001). The expression of MMP1 by SFs can be increased by the activation of SFs with triggers relevant for rheumatoid arthritis, as cytokines like TNF-α or IL1β (Andreakos et al., 2003). Taken together, measurement of the levels of MMP1 produced by activated SFs is a readout that is highly relevant in the context of RA as this event reflects the level of activation of SFs towards an erosive phenotype as it is seen in the pannus. If a reduced expression of a candidate drug target in activated SFs leads to the reduction of MMP1 expression by these cells, the drug target is then proven to be involved in the regulation of MMP1 expression and thus considered relevant for the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of RA.\n\n\nIn the following examples, the development of an assay, further referred to as ‘MMP assay’, monitors the MMP1 production by synovial fibroblasts (SFs) in response to diverse activating triggers (Example 2.1). The use of this assay is then described for the validation of gene products that are considered drug targets for the development of RA therapies (Example 2.2). The validation of drug targets is performed using recombinant adenoviruses, further referred to as knock-down viruses or Ad-siRNAs, that mediate the expression in cells of shRNA's which reduce the expression levels of targeted genes by a RNAi (RNA interference)-based mechanism (see WO 03/020931). The identification of compounds modulating the activity of the validated drug targets is then described in Table 3. The use of the ‘MMP assay’ for the testing of compounds that modulate the activity of the drug targets identified is described further below.\n\n\nAssay Examples\n\n\nControl Viruses Used:\n\n\nThe control viruses used in these studies are listed below. dE1/dE2A adenoviruses are generated from these adapter plasmids by co-transfection of the helper plasmid pWEAd5Af1II-rITR.dE2A in PER.E2A packaging cells, as described in WO99/64582.\n\n\nNegative Control Viruses:\n\n\nAd5-eGFP_KD: Target sequence: GCTGACCCTGAAGTTCATC (SEQ ID NO: 1).

Various primary antibodies are tested, as well as various ELISA protocols. The following protocol is developed and validated to measure MMP1 levels in SF supernatant in 384 well plates: white Lumitrac 600 384 well plates (Greiner) are coated with 2 μg/mL anti-MMP1 antibody MAB1346 (Chemicon). The antibody is diluted in buffer 40 (1.21 g Tris base (Sigma), 0.58 g NaCl (Calbiochem) and 5 \nml\n 10% NaN\n3 \n(Sigma) in 1 L milliQ water and adjusted to pH 8.5). After overnight incubation at 4° C., plates are washed with PBS (80 g NaCl, 2 g KCl (Sigma), 11.5 g Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n.7H\n2\nO and 2 g KH\n2\nPO\n4 \nin 10 L milliQ; pH 7.4) and blocked with 100 μL/well Casein buffer (2% Casein (VWR International) in PBS). Next day, casein buffer is removed from ELISA plates and replaced by 50 μL/well EC buffer (4 g casein, 2.13 g Na\n2\nHPO\n4 \n(Sigma), 2 g bovine albumin (Sigma), 0.69 g NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n.H\n2\nO (Sigma), 0.5 g CHAPS (Roche), 23.3 g NaCl, 4 ml 0.5 M EDTA pH 8 (Invitrogen), 5 \nml\n 10% NaN\n3 \nin 1 L milliQ and adjusted to pH 7.0). 0.25 mM DTT (Sigma) is added to the thawed samples plates. After removal of the EC buffer, 20 μL of sample is transferred to the ELISA plates. After overnight incubation at 4° C. plates are washed twice with PBS and once with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma)) and incubated with 35 μL/well biotinylated anti-MMP1 antibody solution (R&D). This secondary antibody is diluted in buffer C (0.82 g NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n.H\n2\nO, 4.82 g Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n, 46.6 g NaCl, 20 g bovine albumin and 4 mL 0.5\nM EDTA pH\n 8 in 2 L milliQ and adjusted to pH 7.0) at a concentration of 5 μg/mL. After 2 h of incubation at RT, plates are washed as described above and incubated with 50 μL/well streptavidin-HRP conjugate (Biosource). Streptavidin-HRP conjugate is diluted in buffer C at a concentration of 0.25 μg/mL. After 45 min, plates are washed as described above and incubated for 5 min with 50 μL/well BM Chem ELISA Substrate (Roche). Readout is performed on the Luminoscan Ascent Luminometer (Labsystems) with an integration time of 200 msec or with an Envision reader (Perkin Elmer).\n\n\nThe increase of MMP1 expression by SFs upon treatment with cytokines relevant in the field of RA (TNF-α, IL1β and OSM) or a combination thereof is shown in \nFIG. 2\n as white bars. For this experiment, SFs are seeded in 96 well plates, 3,000 cells/well. 24 h later, the medium is changed to M199 medium supplemented with 1% FBS. One day after the medium change, cytokines or combinations thereof are added to the cultures, each cytokine being added to a final concentration of 25 ng/mL. 72 h after cytokine addition, the supernatant is collected and processed in the MMP1 ELISA as described in the protocol given above. In parallel with this experiment, SFs are triggered, using the same protocol, with the supernatant of THP1 cells (2-fold diluted in M199+1% FBS) treated with the same cytokines or combinations of cytokines for 48 h in M199 medium+1% FBS. MMP1 levels for these samples are shown in \nFIG. 2\n as grey bars. The induction of the MMP1 expression by SFs triggered with the supernatants of TNF-α-treated THP1 cells is stronger (>4.5 fold induction) as compared to the SFs triggered with recombinant TNF-α alone (3-fold induction) and almost equals the 5-fold induction obtained by a mixture of 3 purified cytokines (TNF-α, IL1βb, OSM). This result indicates that the supernatant of TNF-α-induced THP1 cells contains, besides TNF-α, additional pro-inflammatory factors that activate SFs towards MMP1 expression. As the role of TNF-α in the RA pathogenesis is validated (TNF-α-blockers such as Infliximab and Etanercept show some efficacy in the treatment of RA patients) and the THP-1 cells are representative for monocytes/macrophages present in the joint of RA patients, the TNF-α-based trigger mixture prepared by contacting THP-1 cells with TNF-α will contain factors present in the joints of RA patients and subsequently is relevant to RA. This TNF-α-based complex trigger, further referred to as the ‘complex trigger’, will further be used as basis for the ‘MMP assay’.\n\n\nInhibition of the activation of SF by the ‘complex trigger’ is shown using dexamethasone, a potent anti-inflammatory agent that also strongly reduces collagen-induced arthritis in rodents (Yang et al., 2004) (\nFIG. 3\n). Dexamethasone is shown to dose-dependently reduce amounts of MMP1 produced by complex trigger activated SFs. SFs are seeded at a density of 3000 cells/well in 96 well plates. 24 hrs after seeding, increasing concentrations of dexamethasone are added to the cells. After overnight incubation, medium of every well is refreshed to supernatant of THP-1 cells treated with TNF-α (50% diluted in M199+0.5% FBS), and the same concentration of dexamethasone as added the day before. 48 hrs after treatment, the supernatant is collected and subjected to the MMP1 ELISA described above. The addition of dexamethasone clearly reduced the MMP1 expression by SFs, with an IC\n50 \nvalue of about 1 nM (see \nFIG. 3\n). These data show that the MMP1 expression by activated SFs can be reduced by the addition of a physiologically relevant inhibitor and represent a proof of principle for the ‘MMP assay’.\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2.2\n\n\nMAPKAPK5 Modulates SF ‘Complex Trigger’-Induced MMP1 Expression\n\n\n(A) Ad-siRNA Virus Functions to Knock Down MAPKAPK5 Expression.\n\n\nRecombinant adenoviruses mediating the expression of siRNA's targeting MAPKAPK5 and eGFP are generated according to the procedure described in WO03/020931. The target sequence used in the recombinant adenovirus is: CGGCACTTTACAGAGAAGC (SEQ ID NO: 5) as well as ATGATGTGTGCCACACACC (SEQ ID NO: 6). The target sequence within the eGFP mRNA used in the recombinant adenovirus is: GCTGACCCTGAAGTTCATC (SEQ ID NO: 1). These sequences are cloned into the adapter plasmid using Sap1 sites. dE1/dE2A adenoviruses are generated from these adapter plasmids by co-transfection of the helper plasmid pWEAd5Af1II-rITR.dE2A in PER.E2A packaging cells, as described in WO99/64582.\n\n\nThe functionality of an adenovirus targeting MAPKAPK5 is tested as follows. These adenoviruses are used to infect primary human SFs cultured in petri dishes as follows. On day 1, 500.000 SFs are seeded per petri dish. One day later, the cells are infected with Ad5-MAPKAPK5-v13_KD (1.6E9 VP/mL) or Ad5-eGFP-v5_KD (1.3E10 VP/mL) at an MOI of 4000 (based on the titers (number of virus particles per mL) defined for the viruses by Q-rt-PCR). On \nday\n 7, cells are detached from the petri dish according to standard procedure using a trypsin EDTA solution. The trypsin is then neutralized by addition of DMEM growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells are then collected by a centrifugation step (1000 rpm, 5 min). The pellet is lysed in 100 μL of fresh RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X100, 0.1% SDS). The samples are then sonicated for 10 sec. The protein concentration of the samples is then determined using the BCA kit (Pierce, Cat No 23227) as described by the provider, using BSA as a standard. To 30 μg of cell lysate diluted to 19.5 μl in RIPA buffer, 3.5 μL of reducing agent (NuPage reducing \nagent No\n 10, Invitrogen NP0004) and 7.5 μL of sample buffer (NuPage LDS sample buffer, Invitrogen NP0007) are added. The 30 μL sample is then boiled for 5 min and loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen NP0301). To allow the estimation of the level of protein knock-down, 15 μg, 7.5 μg and 3.75 μg of the lysate of the Ad5-eGFP-v5_KD infected cells are also loaded onto the gel. The gel is then run for 2 hours at 100V in 1×MOPS/SDS NuPage running buffer (Invitrogen NP001). 10 μl of Seablue Plus Prestained standard (Invitrogen LC5925) is used to estimate protein size on the gel. The proteins on the gel are then transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Invitrogen LC2002) by a wet blotting procedure using a transfer buffer prepared by mixing 100 ml \nNupage Transfer buffer\n 20* (NP0006-1), 400 mL methanol and 1500 mL Milli Q water. Before the transfer, the membrane is first soaked in methanol and in transfer buffer. The transfer is performed at 100V for 90 minutes. The membrane is then blocked by 30 min soaking in blocking buffer (2% blocking blocking powder (Amersham, RPN 2109) prepared in PBST (PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma, P1379)). After blocking, the immunodetection is performed using a mouse monoclonal antibody against MAPKAPK5 (BD Biosciences, Cat No 612080) diluted 250 fold in blocking buffer. After overnight incubation with this primary antibody, the membrane is washed 3 times with PBST and incubated 1 hr with the secondary antibody ((Polyclonal goat anti-mouse Ig, HRP conjugated (DAKO P0447) diluted 50000 fold in blocking buffer. The blot is then washed 3 times in PBST and the detection is performed with ECL advance (RPN2109, Amersham) on a Kodakimager according to the manufacturers instructions. The Western Blotting revealed a lower expression level of MAPKAPK5 in the Ad5-MAPKAPK5-v13_KD infected cells compared to the cells infected with the Ad5-eGFP-v5_KD negative control virus. Comparison with the diluted Ad5-eGFP-v5_KD infected samples allowed to estimate the reduction in expression to be 2-fold. Equal loading of the 30 μg samples is demonstrated by immunodetection of β-actin after removal of the MAPKAPK5 antibody by a ‘stripping procedure’ (5 minutes boiling of the membrane in PBST). Immunodetection of β-actin is performed according to the method described for MAPKAPK5 detection, but using a goat polyclonal antibody against β-actin (Santa Cruz, Cat N\no \nSC-1615) at a 1000 fold dilution as primary antibody and a rabbit anti goat antibody at a 50000 fold dilution as a secondary antibody. Results of this experiment are given in \nFIG. 4\n. Taken together, this experiment demonstrated the functionality of the Ad-siRNA virus produced to reduce the MAPKAPK5 expression levels in primary human SFs.\n\n\n(B) MAPKAPK5 Knock-Down Ad-siRNA Reduces SF-Induced MMP1 Expression\n\n\nThe efficacy of Ad5-MAPKAPK5-v13_KD virus in the ‘MMP assay’ is tested as follows. Day 1, SFs (\npassage\n 9 to 10) are seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 3000 cells per well in complete synovial growth medium (Cell Applications). One day later, the cells are infected with increasing amounts (3, 6; 9, 12 or 15 μl) of following viruses: Ad5-eGFP-v5_KD, Ad5-MAPKAPK5-v12_KD, Ad5-MAPKAPK5-v13_KD, Ad5-MMP1-v10_KD. The virus load is corrected by addition of the neutral virus Ad5-Luc-v13_KD to bring the final virus volume on the cells to 15 μL in every well. This correction guarantees that the effects observed do not result from the virus load applied to the cells. The cells are then incubated for 5 days before the activation step. This step involves the replacement, in every well, of the growth medium by 75 μL of M199 medium supplemented with 25 μL of ‘complex trigger’. 48 hrs after the activation step, the supernatant is collected and subjected to the MMP1 ELISA as described in Example 1. The results of the experiment are shown in \nFIG. 5\n. The quality of the experiment is demonstrated by the efficacy of the Ad-siRNA virus targeting MMP1 itself. This positive control virus strongly reduces the MMP1 expression by SFs, whereas the negative control virus, designed to target the expression of luciferase, does not influence the levels of MMP1 expression. Two viruses used to validate the MAPKAPK5 target (Ad5-MAPKAPK5-v12_KD and Ad5-MAPKAPK5-v13) do also lead to a clear reduction of the complex trigger induced MMP1 expression by primary human SFs. It can be concluded, from this experiment, that MAPKAPK5 represents a valuable drug target that is shown to modulate MMP1 expression in SFs. Similarly, the inhibition of MAPKAPK5 enzymatic activity by a small molecule compound is expected to reduce the ‘complex cytokine’ induced MMP1 expression in the ‘MMP assay’. The inhibition of MAPKAPK5 enzymatic activity by a small molecule compound is also predicted to reduce the degradation of the joint associated with RA.\n\n\n(C) In Vitro ‘MMP Assay’ Testing of Compounds Inhibiting MAPKAPK5\n\n\nCompounds inhibiting the MAPKAPK5 activity in a biochemical assay (i.e. cell free, using purified enzyme), are tested in the ‘MMP assay’ according to following protocol.\n\n\nThe compound master stocks (all at 10 mM concentration in 100% DMSO) are diluted 10-fold in water (Distilled water, GIBCO, DNAse and RNAse free) to obtain a 1 mM intermediate work stock in 10% DMSO. This intermediate work stock is further diluted either 3-fold (or 10-fold) in 10% DMSO to obtain an intermediate work stock of 333 μM (or 100 μM) concentration, respectively, in 10% DMSO. The 1 mM as well as 333 μM (or 100 μM) intermediate work stocks are then further diluted 10-fold in 1.1% DMSO to obtain the 10× workstocks at 100 μM and 33.3 μM (or 10 μM) concentration in 2% DMSO. This 10× work stock is then diluted 10-fold in M199 medium supplemented with 1% FBS to obtain the final ‘1× compound preparation’ containing the compounds at 10 μM and 3.33 μM (or 1 μM) as well as 0.2% DMSO. These are the final conditions at which the compounds are tested on the cells. In parallel, the 10× work stock is diluted 10-fold in ‘complex trigger’ (i.e. the supernatant of TNF-α treated THP1 cells produced as described in Example 1) that is diluted 2-fold in M199 supplemented with 1% FBS to produce the ‘1× compound in 50% complex trigger preparation’.\n\n\nAt day 1, RASFs are seeded in 96 well plates (Flat bottom, tissue culture treated, Greiner) at a density of 3000 cells/well in complete synovial growth medium (Cell Applications). \nDay\n 5, the compounds are added to the cultured cells as follows. Medium is completely removed from the cells and replaced by 75 μL of the ‘1× compound preparations’ containing the compounds at either 10M or 3.33CM (or 1 μM) in M199 medium supplemented with 1% FBS and 0.2% DMSO. After an incubation period of 2 hours, which allows the compounds to equilibrate and enter the cells, 25 μL of the ‘1× compound in 50% complex trigger preparations’ are added to the wells on top of the ‘1× compound preparation’, in the wells containing the corresponding compounds at corresponding concentration. In this way, an 8-fold diluted complex trigger is ultimately applied to the cells. An incubation of 48 hrs is then performed and 20 μl of the cell supernatant is then processed in the MMP1 ELISA as described above, delivering raw data (RLU: relative luminescence units). Following controls are included in the experiments. A maximal signal control, in which the cells are activated by the complex trigger but only the 0.2% DMSO vehicle (and thus no compound) is added. This control indicates the maximal level of MMP1 that can be achieved in the test. A minimal signal control is also included in these experiments. Here, cells are not triggered. The medium of the cells is then changed to 100 μl M199 medium supplemented with 1% FBS at \nday\n 5. This control returns the basal MMP1 levels produced by the RASFs. The percent inhibition of the MMP1 expression achieved by the compounds is then calculated based on the RLU data returned by the ELISA with following formula: [[(maximal MMP1 levels−minimal MMP1 levels)−(MMP1 level compound X at concentration Y−minimal MMP1 levels)]/(maximal MMP1 levels−minimal MMP1 levels)]×100.\n\n\nToxicity of the compounds is assessed as follows. Day 1, SFs are seeded in white, tissue culture treated 96 well plates at a density of 3000 cells per well in 100 μL complete synovial growth medium. The compound handling, compound addition to the cells as well as activation of the cells is further performed as described above in this example for the determination of the MMP1 levels. After the 48 hrs incubation period, the medium is removed from the wells, replaced by 50 μL fresh M199 medium supplemented with 1% FBS. 50 μL of substrate (Promega Celltiter Glow cell viability kit) is then added to the wells. After an incubation period of 10 min, luminescence signal is measured. A reduction of the luminescence signal by more than 50% as compared to the maximal control wells is considered to reflect significant toxicity. No toxicity is observed for the compounds tested in the ‘MMP assay’.\n\n\nIt should be understood that factors such as the differential cell penetration capacity of the various compounds can contribute to discrepancies between the activity of the compounds in the in vitro biochemical and cellular MMP assays.\n\n\nFor the purpose of Table 3 and Table 4 below, MMP1 EC\n50 \nof each

(PBMCs) are isolated from “buffy coats” prepared from the blood of healthy volunteers, isolated essentially according to method of Bøyum (1984). In brief, buffy coat is diluted 1:1 with 1×PBS (Gibco) and 30 mL is carefully put on top of 20 mL Lymphoprep™ (Lucron Bioproducts) in 50 mL Falcon tubes. After centrifugation (35 min, 400 g, 18° C.) the mononuclear cells are collected from the white interphase and washed 3 times with 1×PBS by resuspending and centrifugation (10 min, 200 g). Isolated PBMCs are finally resuspended in RPMI 1640 (Cat. No. 21875, Gibco) that is supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone).\n\n\nFor the assay PBMCs are seeded at 2.5E6 cells/mL in 160 μL in 96-well plates (Nunc). Serial dilution of the test compounds are made first in DMSO (Sigma) and then diluted 50-fold in M199 medium (Gibco) containing 1% heat-inactivated FBS. Compounds are further 1/10 diluted in the assay plates to obtain final DMSO concentration of 0.2%. Cells are preincubated with the compounds for 1 hr at 37° C., 5% CO\n2\n. Then, cells are stimulated with LPS (\nEscherichia coli \nserotype 026:B6, Cat. No. L2654, Sigma) that is added in a volume of 20 μL to a final concentration of 1 μg/mL and cells are further cultured for 24 hr. The plates are centrifuged and the supernatant is collected and stored at −80° C. until analysis of appropriate dilutions in ELISAs.\n\n\nThe following 384-well chemiluminescent ELISA protocol was developed to measure TNFα levels in the supernatant: White Lumitrac 600 384-well plates (Greiner) are coated with (40 μL/well) anti-TNFα capture antibody (Cat. No. 551220, BD Pharmingen) that is diluted to 1 μg/mL in 1×PBS (Gibco). After overnight incubation at 4° C., plates are washed with 1×PBS (80 g NaCl, 2 g KCl (Sigma), 11.5 g Na\n2\nHPO\n4\n.7H2O and 2 g KH\n2\nPO\n4 \nin 10 L milliQ; pH 7.4) and blocked with 100 μL/well buffer B (1×PBS containing 1% BSA (Sigma), 5% sucrose (Sigma) and 0.05% NaN\n3 \n(Sigma)). After 4 hr incubation at RT, blocking buffer is removed and plates are washed once with PBST (1×PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma)). Then, 40 μL of sample is transferred to the ELISA plates and plates are incubated at 4° C. Next day, plates are washed 3 times (twice with PBST and once with PBS) and 35 μL/well biotinylated anti-TNFα antibody (Cat. No. 554511, BD Pharmingen) diluted first to a concentration of 250 ng/ml in buffer D (1×PBS with 1% BSA) is added. After 2 h of incubation at RT, plates are washed as described above and 35 μL/well of a 1/2000 dilution of streptavidin-HRP conjugate (Cat. No. SNN2004, Biosource) in buffer D is added. After 45 min, plates are washed as described above and incubated for 5 min with 50 μL/well BM Chemiluminescence ELISA Substrate POD (Roche). Readout is performed on the Luminoscan Ascent Luminometer (Labsystems) with an integration time of 100 msec delivering raw data (RLU: relative luminescence units). The following controls are included in the experiments, a maximal signal control, in which the cells are activated by LPS but only the 0.2% DMSO vehicle (and thus no compound) is added. This control indicates the maximal level of TNFα that can be achieved in the test. A minimal signal control is also included in these experiments. Here, cells are not triggered. This control returns the basal TNFα levels produced by the PBMCs. The percent inhibition (PIN) of the TNFα release, achieved by the compounds is then calculated based on the RLU data returned by the ELISA with following formula: 100−[((TNFα level compound X at concentration Y−minimal TNFα levels)/maximal TNFα levels−minimal TNFα levels))×100]. Where compounds are tested at 8 concentrations (1/3 serial dilution), EC50-values can be calculated by curve fitting of the means of the PIN data achieved for a compound at each test concentration.\n\n\nTo assay the effect of compounds on the release of IL1 and IL6 by LPS stimulated PBMC cultures, appropriate dilutions of the supernatant can be measured using the same ELISA protocol as described above. Matched pair antibodies for IL1 and IL6 ELISA (all from R&D Systems) may be used as follows: anti-IL1 capture antibody (Cat. No. MAB601) used at 0.5 μg/mL, biotinylated anti-IL1 detection antibody (Cat. No. BAF201) used at 50 ng/mL; anti-IL6 capture antibody (Cat. No. MAB206) used at 1 μg/mL; biotinylated anti-IL6 detection antibody (Cat. No. BAF206) used at 50 ng/mL.\n\n\nFor the purpose of Table 5 below, PBMC EC\n50 \nof each compound, which can be determined using the assay method described herein, is expressed as follows:\n\n\n####

of the compound of the present invention to the subject patient includes both self-administration and administration by another person. The patient may be in need of treatment for an existing disease or medical condition, or may desire prophylactic treatment to prevent or reduce the risk for diseases and medical conditions affected by a disturbance in bone metabolism. The compound of the present invention may be delivered to the subject patient orally, transdermally, via inhalation, injection, nasally, rectally or via a sustained release formulation.\n\n\nA preferred regimen of the present method comprises the administration to a subject in suffering from a disease condition characterized by inflammatory, with an effective matrix metallo-protease inhibiting amount of a compound of the present invention for a period of time sufficient to reduce the abnormal levels of extracellular matrix degradation in the patient, and preferably terminate, the self-perpetuating processes responsible for said degradation. A special embodiment of the method comprises administering of an effective matrix metallo-protease inhibiting amount of a compound of the present invention to a subject patient suffering from or susceptible to the development of rheumatoid arthritis, for a period of time sufficient to reduce or prevent, respectively, collagen and bone degradation in the joints of said patient, and preferably terminate, the self-perpetuating processes responsible for said degradation.\n\n\nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects may be used, care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce side effects.\n\n\nThe data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.\n\n\nA preferred therapeutically effective amount of the compound of the present invention to administer to a subject patient is about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg administered from once to three times a day. For example, an effective regimen of the present method may administer about 5 mg to about 1000 mg of said compound of the present invention from once to three times a day. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular subject patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular inflammatory condition. A consideration of these factors is well within the purview of the ordinarily skilled clinician for the purpose of determining the therapeutically effective or prophylactically effective dosage amount needed to prevent, counter, or arrest the progress of the condition.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration. Such compositions typically comprise at least one compound of the invention and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” is intended to include solid carriers such as lactose, magnesium stearate, terra alba, sucrose, talc, stearic acid, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia or the like; and liquids such as vegetable oils, arachis oil and sterile water, or the like, any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. This listing of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers is not to be construed as limiting. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions.\n\n\nA pharmaceutical composition of the invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.\n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor ELTM (BASF, Parsippany, N.J.) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, 'chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum mono stearate and gelatin.\n\n\nSterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound (e.g., a compound according to an embodiment of the invention) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.\n\n\nOral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash, wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed.\n\n\nPharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.\n\n\nFor administration by inhalation, the compounds are delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressured container or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer.\n\n\nSystemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art.\n\n\nThe compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nIt is especially advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration.\n\n\nA compound according to an embodiment of the invention may be provided as a salt, preferably as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of compounds of formula I. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of these compounds include those derived from organic acids such as acetic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, lactic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, phenylacetic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulphonic acid, benzenesulphonic acid and p-toluenesulphonic acid, mineral acids such as hydrochloric and sulphuric acid and the like, giving methanesulphonate, benzenesulphonate, p-toluenesulphonate, hydrochloride and sulphate, and the like, respectively or those derived from bases such as organic and inorganic bases. Examples of suitable inorganic bases for the formation of salts of compounds for this invention include the hydroxides, carbonates, and bicarbonates of ammonia, lithium, sodium, calcium, potassium, aluminium, iron, magnesium, zinc and the like. Salts can also be formed with suitable organic bases. Such bases suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts with compounds of the present invention include organic bases which are nontoxic and strong enough to form salts. Such organic bases are already well known in the art and may include amino acids such as arginine and lysine, mono-, di-, or trihydroxyalkylamines such as mono-, di-, and triethanolamine, choline, mono-, di-, and trialkylamines, such as methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine, guanidine; N-methylglucosamine; N-methylpiperazine; morpholine; ethylenediamine; N-benzylphenethylamine; tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane; and the like.\n\n\nSalts of compounds according to an embodiment of the invention may be prepared in a conventional manner using methods well known in the art. Acid addition salts of said basic compounds may be prepared by dissolving the free base compounds according to the first or second aspects of the invention in aqueous or aqueous alcohol solution or other suitable solvents containing the required acid. Where a compound of the invention contains an acidic function, a base salt of said compound may be prepared by reacting said compound with a suitable base. The acid or base salt may separate directly or can be obtained by concentrating the solution e.g. by evaporation. The compounds of this invention may also exist in solvated or hydrated forms.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the foregoing description is exemplary and explanatory in nature, and is intended to illustrate the invention and its preferred embodiments. Through routine experimentation, an artisan will recognise apparent modifications and variations that may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Thus, the invention is intended to be defined not by the above description, but by the following claims and their equivalents.\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nChoy E H, Panayi G S. (2001).
