Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel tri-substituted pyrimidine compounds having an excellent phosphodiesterase 10 (PDE10) inhibitory activity and useful as pharmaceuticals, and to processes for preparing such compounds and to their use.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nCyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (hereinafter referred to as phosphodiesterase or PDE) is an enzyme that hydrolyses a phosphodiester bond in cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP (adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate) or cGMP (guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate), etc. as a substrate, to provide nucleotides such as 5′AMP (adenosine 5′-monophosphate) or 5′GMP (guanosine 5′-monophosphate), etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCyclic nucleotides such as cAMP and cGMP are involved in the regulation of many functions within a living body as second messengers of intracellular signaling. Intracellular concentrations of cAMP and cGMP, which vary in response to extracellular signals, are regulated by a balance between enzymes involved in synthesis of cAMP and cGMP (adenylate cyclase and guanylate cyclase) and PDE involved in hydrolysis of such enzymes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor PDE of mammals, many kinds of PDEs have been isolated and identified in mammals so far, and they have been classified into plural families in accordance with amino-acid sequence homology, biochemical properties, characterization by inhibitors and the like (Francis et al., Prog. Nucleic Acid Res., vol. 65, pp. 1-52, 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmong such various families of PDEs of mammals, phosphodiesterase 10 (PDE10) [more specifically phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A)] recognizes both cAMP and cGMP as a substrate. It has been reported that PDE10 has a greater affinity for cAMP. Further, cDNAs of human, mouse and rat PDE10As have been isolated and identified. Furthermore, the existence of PDE10 proteins has been confirmed. (Fujishige et al., J. Biol. Chem., vol. 274, pp. 18438-18445, 1999; Kotera et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., vol. 261, pp. 551-557, 1999; Soderling et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, vol. 96, pp. 7071-7076, 1999; and Loughley et al., Gene, vol. 234, pp. 109-117, 1999).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegarding PDE10 inhibitory compounds (PDE10 inhibitors), that is, compounds having inhibitory action on the enzyme activity of PDE10, the followings have been reported:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in EP1250923 (Pfizer) and WO2005/082883 (Pfizer), papaverine and various aromatic heterocyclic compounds such as quinazoline and isoquinazoline compounds are disclosed as PDE10 inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt also has been disclosed therein that PDE10 inhibitors are useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of diseases or conditions such as:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPsychotic disorder:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nfor example, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,\n \ndelusional disorder, substance-induced psychotic disorder, personality disorder of the paranoid type, personality disorder of the schizoid type, etc;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAnxiety disorder:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nfor example, panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobia, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, etc;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nMovement disorder:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nfor example, Huntington's disease, dyskinesia associated with dopamine agonist therapy, Parkinson's disease, restless leg syndrome, etc;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nDrug addiction:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nfor example, addiction to alcohol, amphetamine, cocaine, or opiate, etc;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nDisorders comprising deficient cognition as a symptom:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nfor example, dementia (including Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, etc), delirium, amnestic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, mental retardation, a learning disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), age-related cognitive decline, etc; and\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nMood disorder:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nfor example, major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, minor depressive disorder, bipolar disorder (including bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder), cyclothymic disorder, etc; or\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nMood episode:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nfor example, major depressive episode, manic or mixed mood episode, hypomanic mood episode, etc.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nFurther, it also has been disclosed therein that PDE10 inhibitors are useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of neurodegenerative disorders, for example, Parkinson's disease, and Hungtington's disease, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the literature of Menniti et al. [Menniti et al., Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs., 2007, 8(1):54-59], it is disclosed that PDE10 inhibitors have potential as antipsychotic agents along with potential to improve cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO2003/000693 (Bayer) discloses imidazotriazine compounds as PDE10 inhibitors. It also discloses that PDE10 inhibitors are useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of neurodegenerative disorders, especially for Parkinson's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO2003/014117 (Bayer) etc discloses various pyrroloisoquinoline compounds as PDE10 inhibitors. It also discloses that these compounds having inhibitory action on PDE10 activity show antiproliferative activity and are useful for treating cancer. Further, it discloses that those compounds are useful for treating conditions of pain and/or for lowering the temperature of the body in fever condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO2005/12485 (Bayer) discloses that PDE10 inhibitors are useful for stimulating insulin release from pancreatic cells. Further, it is disclosed that PDE10 inhibitors are useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of diabetes and diseases related thereof:\n\n\n \n \nfor example, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), latent autoimmune diabetes adult (LADA), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), impaired fasting glucose (IGF), gestational diabetes, metabolic syndrome X, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSee also WO2005/120514 (Pfizer), which discloses PDE10 inhibitors that are said to be useful to decrease body weight and/or body fat in the treatment of obese patients. Further, it is disclosed therein that those PDE10 inhibitors are useful for treatment of non-insulin dependent diabetes (NIDDM), metabolic syndrome and glucose intolerance etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, certain pyrimidine compounds are known. See for example WO2002/38551 (Roche) which discloses tri-substituted pyrimidine compounds having an activity as Neuropeptide Y receptor ligands.\n\n\n \nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel compounds having an excellent PDE10 inhibitory activity, processes for preparing such compounds, use of the compounds, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising said compounds, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present inventors have been studied and as a result, have been found that certain tri-substituted pyrimidine compounds have excellent PDE 10 inhibitory activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNamely, the present invention relates to a tri-substituted pyrimidine compound represented by formula [I\n0\n]:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein:\n\n\n \n \n \n \neither one of X\n1 \nand X\n2 \nis N, and the other of X\n1 \nand X\n2 \nis CH;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA is *-CH═CH—, *-C(Alk)=CH—, *-CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— or *-O—CH\n2\n— (* is a bond with R\n1\n);\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlk is a lower alkyl group;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRing B is an optionally substituted nitrogen-containing aliphatic heterocyclic group;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1 \nis an optionally substituted quinoxalinyl or an optionally substituted quinolyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nY\n0 \nis a mono- or di-substituted amino group,\n\n\n \n \nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso, in one of the preferred embodiments of the invention, the present invention relates to a tri-substituted pyrimidine compound represented by formula [I]:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein:\n\n\n \n \n \n \neither one of X\n1 \nand X\n2 \nis N, and the other of X\n1 \nand X\n2 \nis CH;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA is *-CH═CH—, *-C(Alk)=CH—, *-CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n— or *-O—CH\n2\n— (* is a bond with R\n1\n);\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlk is a lower alkyl group;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRing B is an optionally substituted nitrogen-containing aliphatic heterocyclic group;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1 \nis an optionally substituted quinoxalinyl or an optionally substituted quinolyl;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nY is a substituted amino group of formula:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n2 \nis a group selected from the group consisting of the following formula (1), (2) and (3);

They can be administered orally or parenterally (for example, through intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, transdermal, transnasal, transmucosal or enteral route).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, in case of treating a central nervous system (CNS) disease, the drug can be directly or indirectly introduced into the brain, by bypassing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Examples of those methods include intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration, and an administration method accompanying intravenous injection of hypertonic solution which enables temporary opening of the BBB (osmotic opening).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen a compound of formula [I\n0\n] or [I] or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is used for medical use, the dosage of the compound may be determined in accordance with the potency or property of that compound, to establish a dosage range which is effective enough for achieving the desired pharmacological efficacy. The dosage may vary depending on the administration route, age, bodyweight, and condition of the patient. A usual dosage range will be, for example, a range of 0.001 to 300 mg/kg per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method of treatment or prophylaxis using a compound of the present invention is applied to a human. However, it may also be applied to mammals other than a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHereinafter, the present invention is illustrated in more detail by the following Examples. The examples are given to illustrate the invention, but should not be construed to limit it. Reference is made to the claims for determining what is reserved to the inventors.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExperimental Example 1\n\n\nMeasurement of PDE10 Inhibitory Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n(1) The enzyme PDE10 (PDE10A) was isolated and prepared from bovine corpus striatum, according to the methods described in references Fujishige et al., Eur.

Postmortem examination of AD brain sections reveals abundant senile plaques (SPs) composed of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and numerous neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by filaments of highly phosphorylated tau proteins (for recent reviews and additional citations see Ginsberg, S. D., et al., “Molecular Pathology of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders,” in \nCerebral Cortex: Neurodegenerative and Age\n-\nrelated Changes in Structure and Function of Cerebral Cortex, \nKluwer Academic/Plenum, NY (1999), pp. 603-654; Vogelsberg-Ragaglia, V., et al., “Cell Biology of Tau and Cytoskeletal Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease,” \nAlzheimer's Disease, \nLippincot, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa. (1999), pp. 359-372).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmyloidosis is a condition characterized by the accumulation of various insoluble, fibrillar proteins in the tissues of a patient. An amyloid deposit is formed by the aggregation of amyloid proteins, followed by the further combination of aggregates and/or amyloid proteins. Formation and accumulation of aggregates of β amyloid (Aβ peptides in the brain are critical factors in the development and progression of AD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the role of amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease, the presence of amyloid deposits has been shown in diseases such as Mediterranean fever, Muckle-Wells syndrome, idiopathic myeloma, amyloid polyneuropathy, amyloid cardiomyopathy, systemic senile amyloidosis, amyloid polyneuropathy, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, Down's syndrome, Scrapie, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, Kuru, Gerstamnn-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, Isolated atrial amyloid, β\n2\n-microglobulin amyloid in dialysis patients, inclusion body myositis, β\n2\n-amyloid deposits in muscle wasting disease, and Islets of Langerhans diabetes Type II insulinoma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fibrillar aggregates of amyloid peptides, Aβ\n1-40 \nand Aβ\n1-42\n, are major metabolic peptides derived from amyloid precursor protein found in senile plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid deposits in AD patients (Xia, W., et al., \nJ. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n97:9299-9304 (2000)). Prevention and reversal of Aβ plaque formation are being targeted as a treatment for this disease (Selkoe, D., J. JAMA 283:1615-1617 (2000); Wolfe, M. S., et al., J. Med. Chem. 41:6-9 (1998); Skovronsky, D. M., and Lee, V. M., \nTrends Pharmacol. Sci. \n21:161-163 (2000)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFamilial AD (FAD) is caused by multiple mutations in the A precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) genes (Ginsberg, S. D., et al., “Molecular Pathology of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders,” in \nCerebral Cortex: Neurodegenerative and Age\n-\nrelated Changes in Structure and Function of Cerebral Cortex, \nKluwer Academic/Plenum, NY (1999), pp. 603-654; Vogelsberg-Ragaglia, V., et al., “Cell Biology of Tau and Cytoskeletal Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease,” \nAlzheimer's Disease, \nLippincot, Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa. (1999), pp. 359-372).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile the exact mechanisms underlying AD are not fully understood, all pathogenic FAD mutations studied thus far increase production of the more amyloidogenic 42-43 amino-acid long form of the Aβ peptide. Thus, at least in FAD, dysregulation of Aβ production appears to be sufficient to induce a cascade of events leading to neurodegeneration. Indeed, the amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that formation of extracellular fibrillar Aβ aggregates in the brain may be a pivotal event in AD pathogenesis (Selkoe, D. J., “Biology of β-amyloid Precursor Protein and the Mechanism of Alzheimer's Disease,” \nAlzheimer's Disease, \nLippincot Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, Pa. (1999), pp. 293-310; Selkoe, D. J., \nJ. Am. Med. Assoc. \n283:1615-1617 (2000); Naslund, J., et al., \nJ. Am. Med. Assoc. \n283:1571-1577 (2000); Golde, T. E., et al., \nBiochimica et Biophysica Acta \n1502:172-187 (2000)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious approaches in trying to inhibit the production and reduce the accumulation of fibrillar Aβ in the brain are currently being evaluated as potential therapies for AD (Skovronsky, D. M. and Lee, V. M., \nTrends Pharmacol. Sci. \n21:161-163 (2000); Vassar, R., et al., \nScience \n286:735-741 (1999); Wolfe, M. S., et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n41:6-9 (1998); Moore, C. L., et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n43:3434-3442 (2000); Findeis, M. A., \nBiochimica et Biophysica Acta \n1502:76-84 (2000); Kuner, P., Bohrmann, et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n275:1673-1678 (2000)). It is therefore of interest to develop ligands that specifically bind fibrillar Aβ aggregates. Since extracellular SPs are accessible targets, these new ligands could be used as in vivo diagnostic tools and as probes to visualize the progressive deposition of Aβ in studies of AD amyloidogenesis in living patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo this end, several interesting approaches for developing fibrillar Aβ aggregate-specific ligands have been reported (Ashburn, T. T., et al., \nChem. Biol. \n3:351-358 (1996); Han, G., et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n118:4506-4507 (1996); Klunk, W. E., et al., \nBiol. Psychiatry \n35:627 (1994); Klunk, W. E., et al., \nNeurobiol. Aging \n16:541-548 (1995); Klunk, W. E., et al., \nSociety for Neuroscience Abstract \n23:1638 (1997); Mathis, C. A., et al., \nProc. XIIth Intl. Symp. Radiopharm. Chem., \nUppsala, Sweden:94-95 (1997); Lorenzo, A. and Yankner, B. A., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n91:12243-12247 (1994); Zhen, W., et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n42:2805-2815 (1999)). The most attractive approach is based on highly conjugated chrysamine-G (CG) and Congo red (CR), and the latter has been used for fluorescent staining of SPs and NFTs in postmortem AD brain sections (Ashburn, T. T., et al., \nChem. Biol. \n3:351-358 (1996); Klunk, W. E., et al., \nJ. Histochem. Cytochem. \n37:1273-1281 (1989)). Thg inhibition constants (K\ni\n) for binding to fibrillar Aβ aggregates of CR, CG, and 3′-bromo- and 3′-iodo derivatives of CG are 2,800, 370, 300 and 250 nM, respectively (Mathis, C. A., et al., \nProc. XIIth Intl. Symp. Radiopharm. Chem., \nUppsala, Sweden:94-95 (1997)). These compounds have been shown to bind selectively to Aβ (1-40) peptide aggregates in vitro as well as to fibrillar Aβ deposits in AD brain sections (Mathis, C. A., et al., \nProc. XIIth Intl. Symp. Radiopharm. Chem., \nUppsala, Sweden:94-95 (1997)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are several potential benefits of imaging Aβ aggregates in the brain. The imaging technique will improve diagnosis by identifying potential patients with excess Aβ plaques in the brain; therefore, they may be likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. It will also be useful to monitor the progression of the disease. When anti-plaque drug treatments become available, imaging Aβ plaques in the brain may provide an essential tool for monitoring treatment. Thus, a simple, noninvasive method for detecting and quantitating amyloid deposits in a patient has been eagerly sought. Presently, detection of amyloid deposits involves histological analysis of biopsy or autopsy materials. Both methods have drawbacks. For example, an autopsy can only be used for a postmortem diagnosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe direct imaging of amyloid deposits in vivo is difficult, as the deposits have many of the same physical properties (e.g., density and water content) as normal tissues. Attempts to image amyloid deposits using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer-assisted tomography (CAT) have been disappointing and have detected amyloid deposits only under certain favorable conditions. In addition, efforts to label amyloid deposits with antibodies, serum amyloid P protein, or other probe molecules have provided some selectivity on the periphery of tissues, but have provided for poor imaging of tissue interiors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPotential ligands for detecting Aβ aggregates in the living brain must cross the intact blood-brain barrier. Thus brain uptake can be improved by using ligands with relatively smaller molecular size (compared to Congo Red) and increased lipophilicity. Highly conjugated thioflavins (S and T) are commonly used as dyes for staining the Aβ aggregates in the AD brain (Elhaddaoui, A., et al., \nBiospectroscopy \n1:351-356 (1995)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA highly lipophilic tracer, [\n18\nF]FDDNP, for binding both tangles (mainly composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein) and plaques (containing Aβ protein aggregates) has been reported. (Shoghi-Jadid K, et al., \nAm J Geriatr Psychiatry. \n2002; 10:24-35). Using positron-emission tomography (PET), it was reported that this tracer specifically labeled deposits of plaques and tangles in nine AD patients and seven comparison subjects. (Nordberg A. \nLancet Neurol. \n2004; 3:519-27). Using a novel pharmacokinetic analysis procedure called the relative residence time of the brain region of interest versus the pons, differences between AD patients and comparison subjects were demonstrated. The relative residence time was significantly higher in AD patients. This is further complicated by an intriguing finding that FDDNP competes with some NSAIDs for binding to Aβ fibrils in vitro and to Aβ plaques ex vivo (Agdeppa E D, et al. 2001; Agdeppa E D, et al., \nNeuroscience. \n2003; 117:723-30).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImaging β-amyloid in the brain of AD patients by using a benzothiazole aniline derivative, [\n11\nC6-OH-BTA-1 (also referred to as [\n11\nC]PIB), was recently reported. (Mathis C A, et al., \nCurr Pharm Des. \n2004; 10:1469-92; Mathis C A, et al., \nArch. Neurol. \n2005, 62:196-200.). Contrary to that observed for [\n18\nFDDNP, [\n11\nC]6-OH-BTA-1 binds specifically to fibrillar Aβ in vivo. Patients with diagnosed mild AD showed marked retention of [\n11\nC]6-OH-BTA-1 in the cortex, known to contain large amounts of amyloid deposits in AD. In the AD patient group, [\n11\nC]6-OH-BTA-1 retention was increased most prominently in the frontal cortex. Large increases also were observed in parietal, temporal, and occipital cortices and in the striatum. [\n11\nC]6-OH-BTA-1 retention was equivalent in AD patients and comparison subjects in areas known to be relatively unaffected by amyloid deposition (such as subcortical white matter, pons, and cerebellum). Recently, another \n11\nC labeled Aβ plaque-targeting probe, a stilbene derivative-[\n11\nC]SB-13, has been studied. In vitro binding using the [\n3\nH]SB-13 suggests that the compound showed excellent binding affinity and binding can be clearly measured in the cortical gray matter, but not in the white matter of AD cases. (Kung M-P, et al., \nBrain Res. \n2004; 1025:89-105. There was a very low specific binding in cortical tissue homogenates of control brains. The Kd values of [\n3\nH]SB-13 in AD cortical homogenates were 2.4±0.2 nM. High binding capacity and comparable values were observed (14-45 pmol/mg protein) (Id.). As expected, in AD patients [\n11\nC]SB-13 displayed a high accumulation in the frontal cortex (presumably an area containing a high density of Aβ plaques) in mild to moderate AD patients, but not in age-matched control subjects. (Verhoeff N P, et al., \nAm J Geriatr Psychiatry. \n2004; 12:584-95).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt would be useful to have a noninvasive technique for imaging and quantitating amyloid deposits in a patient. In addition, it would be useful to have compounds that inhibit the aggregation of amyloid proteins to form amyloid deposits and a method for determining a compound's ability to inhibit amyloid protein aggregation.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel compounds of Formulae I, I′, II, I″ and I′″.

A small amount of non-radiolabeled compound (1-2 mg) is dissolved in 100 μL EtOH and mixed with 200 μL HCl (1 N) and 1 mL Sn-glucoheptonate solution (containing 8-32 μg SnCl\n2 \nand 80-320 μg Na-glucoheptonate, pH 6.67) and 50 μL EDTA solution (0.1 N). [\n99m\nTc]Pertechnetatc (100-200 μL; ranging from 2-20 mCi) saline solution are then added. The reaction is heated for 30 min at 100° C., then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture is analyzed on TLC (EtOH:conc. NH\n3 \n9:1) for product formation and purity check. The mixture can be neutralized with phosphate buffer to pH 5.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further relates to a method of preparing a technetium-99m complex according to the present invention by reacting technetium-99m in the form of a pertechnetate in the presence of a reducing agent and optionally a suitable chelator with an appropriate Ch-containing compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reducing agent serves to reduce the Tc-99m pertechnetate which is eluted from a molybdenum-technetium generator in a physiological saline solution. Suitable reducing agents arc, for example, dithionite, formamidine sulphinic acid, diaminoethane disulphinate or suitable metallic reducing agents such as Sn(II), Fe(II), Cu(I), Ti(III) or Sb(III). Sn(II) has proven to be particularly suitable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the above-mentioned complex-forming reaction, technetium-99m is reacted with an appropriate compound of the invention as a salt or in the form of technetium bound to comparatively weak chelators. In the latter case the desired technetium-99m complex is formed by ligand exchange. Examples of suitable chelators for the radionuclide are dicarboxylic acids, such as oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, orthophtalic acid, malic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, salicylic acid or derivatives of these acids; phosphorus compounds such as pyrophosphates; or enolates. Citric acid, tartaric acid, ascorbic acid, glucoheptonic acid or a derivative thereof are particularly suitable chelators for this purpose, because a chelate of technetium-99m with one of these chelators undergoes the desired ligand exchange particularly easily.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most commonly used procedure for preparing [Tc\nv\nO]\n−3\nN\n2\nS\n2 \ncomplexes is based on stannous (II) chloride reduction of [\n99m\nTc]pertechnetate, the common starting material. The labeling procedure normally relies on a Tc-99m ligand exchange reaction between Tc-99m (Sn)-glucoheptonate and the N\n2\nS\n2 \nligand. Preparation of stannous (II) chloride and preserving it in a consistent stannous (II) form is critically important for the'success of the labeling reaction. To stabilize the air-sensitive stannous ion it is a common practice in nuclear medicine to use a lyophilized kit, in which the stannous ion is in a lyophilized powder form mixed with an excess amount of glucoheptonate under an inert gas like nitrogen or argon. The preparation of the lyophilized stannous chloride/sodium glucoheptonate kits ensures that the labeling reaction is reproducible and predictable. The N\n2\nS\n2 \nligands are usually air-sensitive (thiols are easily oxidized by air) and there are subsequent reactions which lead todecomposition of the ligands. The most convenient and predictable method to preserve the ligands is to produce lyophilized kits containing 100-500 μg of the ligands under argon or nitrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the compounds of this invention are to be used as imaging agents, they must be labeled with suitable radioactive halogen isotopes. Although \n125\nI-isotopes are useful for laboratory testing, they will generally not be useful for actual diagnostic purposes because of the relatively long half-life (60 days) and low gamma-emission (30-65 Key) of \n125\nI. The isotope \n123\nI has a half life of thirteen hours and gamma energy of 159 KeV, and it is therefore expected that labeling of ligands to be used for diagnostic purposes would be with this isotope. Other isotopes which may be used include \n131\nI (half life of 2 hours). Suitable bromine isotopes include \n77\nBr and \n76\nBr.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe radiohalogenated compounds of this invention lend themselves easily to formation from materials which could be provided to users in kits. Kits for forming the imaging agents can contain, for example, a vial containing a physiologically suitable solution of an intermediate of Formulae I, I′, II, I″ and I′″ in a concentration and at a pH suitable for optimal complexing conditions. The user would add to the vial an appropriate quantity of the radioisotope, e.g., Na\n123\nI, and an oxidant, such as hydrogen peroxide. The resulting labeled ligand may then be administered intravenously to a patient, and receptors in the brain imaged by means of measuring the gamma ray or photo emissions therefrom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince the radiopharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can be prepared easily and simply, the preparation can be carried out readily by the user. Therefore, the present invention also relates to a kit, comprising:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(1) A non-radiolabeled compound of the invention, the compound optionally being in a dry condition; and also optionally having an inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or auxiliary substances added thereto; and\n \n(2) a reducing agent and optionally a chelator;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nwherein ingredients (1) and (2) may optionally be combined; and\n\n \n \n \n \n \nfurther wherein instructions for use with a prescription for carrying out the above-described method by reacting ingredients (1) and (2) with technetium-99m in the form of a pertechnetate solution may be optionally included.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nExamples of suitable reducing agents and chelators for the above kit have been listed above. The pertechnetate solution can be obtained by the user from a molybdenum-technetium generator. Such generators are available in a number of institutions that perform radiodiagnostic procedures. As noted above the ingredients (1) and (2) may be combined, provided they are compatible. Such a monocomponent kit, in which the combined ingredients are preferably lyophilized, is excellently suitable to be reacted by the user with the pertechnetate solution in a simple manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen desired, the radioactive diagnostic agent may contain any additive such as pH controlling agents (e.g., acids, bases, buffers), stabilizers (e.g., ascorbic acid) or isotonizing agents (e.g., sodium chloride).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” as used herein refers to those carboxylate salts or acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. The term “salts” refers to the relatively nontoxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. Also included are those salts derived from non-toxic organic acids such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids, for example acetic acid, phenyl-substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxy alkanoic and alkanedioic acids, aromatic acids, and aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed. Further representative salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, nitrate, acetate, oxalate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, borate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, naphthylate mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactiobionate and laurylsulphonate salts, propionate, pivalate, cyclamate, isethionate, and the like. These may include cations based on the alkali and alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like, as well as, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium and amine cations including, but not limited to ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, ethylamine, and the like. (See, for example, Berge S. M., et al., \nPharmaceutical Salts, J. Pharm. Sci. \n66:1-19 (1977) which is incorporated herein by reference.)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the first step of the present method of imaging, a labeled compound of Formulae I, I′, II, I″ and I′″ is introduced into a tissue or a patient in a detectable quantity. The compound is typically part of a pharmaceutical composition and is administered to the tissue or the patient by methods well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe administration of the labeled compound to a patient can be by a general or local administration route. For example, the compound can be administered either orally, rectally, parenterally (intravenous, by intramuscularly or subcutaneously), intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, intravesically, locally (powders, ointments or drops), or as a buccal or nasal spray. The labeled compound may be administered to the patient such that it is delivered throughout the body. Alternatively, the labeled compound can be administered to a specific organ or tissue of interest. For example, it is desirable to locate and quantitate amyloid deposits in the brain in order to diagnose or track the progress of Alzheimer's disease in a patient. One of the most desirable characteristics of an in vivo imaging agent of the brain is the ability to cross the intact blood-brain barrier after a bolus iv injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment of the invention, the labeled compound is introduced into a patient in a detectable quantity and after sufficient time has passed for the compound to become associated with amyloid deposits, the labeled compound is detected noninvasively inside the patient. In another embodiment of the invention, a radiolabeled compound of Formula I, I′, II, I″ or I′″ is introduced into a patient, sufficient time is allowed for the compound to become associated with amyloid deposits, and then a sample of tissue from the patient is removed and the labeled compound in the tissue is detected apart from the patient. In a third embodiment of the invention, a tissue sample is removed from a patient and a labeled compound of Formula I, I′, II, I″ or I′″ is introduced into the tissue sample. After a sufficient amount of time for the compound to become bound to amyloid deposits, the compound is detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “tissue” means a part of a patient's body. Examples of tissues include the brain, heart, liver, blood vessels, and arteries. A detectable quantity is a quantity of labeled compound necessary to be detected by the detection method chosen. The amount of a labeled compound to be introduced into a patient in order to provide for detection can readily be determined by those skilled in the art. For example, increasing amounts of the labeled compound can be given to a patient until the compound is detected by the detection method of choice. A label is introduced into the compounds to provide for detection of the compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “patient” means humans and other animals. Those skilled in the art are also familiar with determining the amount of time sufficient for a compound to become associated with amyloid deposits. The amount of time necessary can easily be determined by introducing a detectable amount of a labeled compound of Formula I, I′, II, I″ or I′″ into a patient and then detecting the labeled compound at various times after administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “associated” means a chemical interaction between the labeled compound and the amyloid deposit. Examples of associations include covalent bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophilic-hydrophilic interactions, hydrophobic-hydrophobic interactions, and complexes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art are familiar with the various ways to detect labeled compounds. For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can be used to detect radiolabeled compounds. The label that is introduced into the compound will depend on the detection method desired. For example, if PET is selected as a detection method, the compound must possess a positron-emitting atom, such as \n11\nC or \n18\nF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe radioactive diagnostic agent should have sufficient radioactivity and radioactivity concentration which can assure reliable diagnosis. For instance, in case of the radioactive metal being technetium-99m, it may be included usually in an amount of 0.1 to 50 mCi in about 0.5 to 5.0 ml at the time of administration. The amount of a compound of Formulae I, I′, II, I″ or I′″ may be such as sufficient to form a stable chelate compound with the radioactive metal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe thus formed chelate compound as a radioactive diagnostic agent is sufficiently stable, and therefore it may be immediately administered as such or stored until its use. When desired, the radioactive diagnostic agent may contain any additive such as pH controlling agents (e.g., acids, bases, buffers), stabilizers (e.g., ascorbic acid) or isotonizing agents (e.g., sodium chloride).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe imaging of amyloid deposits can also be carried out quantitatively so that the amount of amyloid deposits can be determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred compounds for imaging include a radioisotope such as \n11\nC, \n123\nI, \n125\nI, \n131\nI, \n18\nF, \n76\nBr or \n77\nBr.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother aspect of the invention is a method of inhibiting amyloid plaque aggregation. The present invention also provides a method of inhibiting the aggregation of amyloid proteins to form amyloid deposits, by administering to a patient an amyloid inhibiting amount of a compound of the above Formulae I, I′, II, I″ or I′″.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art are readily able to determine an amyloid inhibiting amount by simply administering a compound of Formulae I, I′, II, I″ or I′″ to a patient in increasing amounts until the growth of amyloid deposits is decreased or stopped. The rate of growth can be assessed using imaging as described above or by taking a tissue sample from a patient and observing the amyloid deposits therein. The compounds of the present invention can be administered to a patient at dosage levels in the range of about 0.1 to about 1,000 mg per day. For a normal human adult having a body weight of about 70 kg, a dosage in the range of about 0.01 to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight per day is sufficient. The specific dosage used, however, can vary. For example, the dosage can depend on a number of factors including the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the pharmacological activity of the compound being used. The determination of optimum dosages for a particular patient is well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are illustrative, but not limiting, of the method and compositions of the present invention. Other suitable modifications and adaptations of the variety of conditions and parameters normally encountered and obvious to those skilled in the art are within the spirit and scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll reagents used were commercial products and were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Flash chromatography (FC) was performed using silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh, Sigma-Aldrich). Preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC) was performed on silica gel plates with a fluorescent indicator that was visualized with light at 254 nm (Analtech). For each procedure, “standard workup” refers to the following steps: addition of the indicated organic solvent, washing the organic layer with water then brine, separation of the organic layer from the aqueous layer, drying off the combined organic layers with sodium sulfate or magnesium sulfate, filtering off the solid and concentrating the filtrate under reduced pressure. \n1\nH NMR spectra were obtained at 200 MHz and \n13\nC NMR spectra were recorded at 50 MHz (Bruker DPX spectrometer). Chemical shifts were reported as δvalues (parts per million) relative to internal TMS. Coupling constants were reported in hertz. The multiplicity is defined by s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), br (broad) or m (multiplet). High-resolution MS experiments were performed at the McMaster Regional Centre for Mass Spectrometry using a Micromass/Waters GCT instrument (GC-EI/CI Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer). Two systems were used to confirm the purity of some compounds listed in this section, system A conditions: Hamilton PRP-1 reverse-phased analytical column (4.1×250 mm, 10 μm), 80/20 CH\n3\nCN/1 mM ammonium formate (pH=7) water buffer, 1.0 mL/min, UV 350 nm; system B conditions: Phenomenex Silica column (4.6×250 mm, 5 μm), 40/60 EtOAc/Hexanes, 1.0 mL/min, UV 350 nm.

Specific activity was estimated by comparing UV peak intensity of the purified [\n18\nF] labeled compound with reference non-radioactive compound of known concentration.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nBinding Studies\n\n\n \n \n \nAD postmortem brain tissues were obtained from University of Washington Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. The neuropathological diagnosis was confirmed by current criteria (NIA-Reagan Institute Consensus Group, 1997). Homogenates were then prepared from dissected gray matters from four pooled AD patients in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) at the concentration of approximately 100 mg wet tissue/ml (motor-driven glass homogenizer with setting of 6 for 30 sec). The homogenates were aliquoted into 1 mL-portions and stored at −70° C. for up to 2 years without loss of binding signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigand [\n125\nI]2 with 2,200 Ci/mmol specific activity and greater than 95% radiochemical purity was prepared using the standard iododestannylation reaction, and purified by a simplified C-4 mini-column as described previously. Binding assays were carried out in 12×75 mm borosilicate glass tubes. For competition studies, the reaction mixture contained 50 □L of pooled AD brain homogenates (20-50 μg), 50 μl of [\n125\nI]2 (0.04-0.06 nM diluted in PBS) and 50 pi of inhibitors (10\n−5\n-10\n−10 \nM diluted serially in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) in a final volume of 1 mL. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 600 \nnM\n 2 in the same assay tubes. The mixture was incubated at 37° C. for 2 h and the bound and the free radioactivity were separated by vacuum filtration through Whatman GF/B filters using a Brandel M-24R cell harvester followed by 2×3 mL washes of PBS at room temperature. Filters containing the bound \n125\nI ligand were counted in a gamma counter (Packard 5000) with 70% counting efficiency. Under the assay conditions, the non-specifically bound fraction was less than 20% of the total radioactivity. The results of inhibition experiments were subjected to nonlinear regression analysis using equilibrium binding data analysis which K\ni \nvalues were calculated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, the specific binding of radioiodinated and radiofluorinated ligands (0.06 nM for [\n125\nI]probe and 0.5 nM for [\n18\nF]probe to homogenates, prepared from the gray and white matters of AD and control brain tissues, were carried out as described above. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 2 μM of the corresponding nonradioactive probes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo further characterize the specificity of plaque binding, we evaluated [\n125\nI]10a and [\n18\nF]17a by a direct in vitro binding assay using homogenates (from different brain regions) prepared from AD and control brain tissues. For both ligands the signal for specific binding was detected predominantly in the gray matter homogenates of AD. In contrast, in white matter homogenates of AD brain, the binding signal for both [\n125\nI]10a and [\n18\nF]17a were very low or nonexistent (\nFIG. 5\n). In the homogenates of control brain tissues (both gray and white matters), the specific binding signal was low suggesting that the specific binding was highly selective to the AD brain only due to the presence of Aβ plaques deposited in these brain samples.\n\n\n \n \nIn vitro Autoradiography\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo compare different probes using similar sections of human brain tissue, human macro-array brain sections from 6 confirmed AD cases and one control subject were assembled. The presence and localization of plaques on the sections was confirmed with immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal Aβ antibody 4G8 (Sigma). The frozen sections were incubated with [\n125\nI] and [\n18\nF]tracers (200,000-250,000 cpm/200 μL) for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were then dipped in saturated lithium carbonate in 40% EtOH (two two-minute washes) and washed with 40% EtOH (one two-minute wash) followed by rinsing with water for 30 sec. After drying, the \n125\nI- or \n18\nF-labeled sections were exposed to Kodak Biomax MR film overnight.\n\n\n \nOrgan Distribution in Normal Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nWhile under isoflurane anesthesia, 0.15 mL of a 0.1% bovine serum albumin solution containing [\n125\nI] or [\n18\nF]tracers (5-10 μCi) was injected directly into the tail vein of ICR mice (22-25 g, male). The mice (n=3 for each time point) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at designated time-points post injection. The organs of interest were removed and weighed, and the radioactivity was counted with an automatic gamma counter. The percentage dose per organ was calculated by a comparison of the tissue counts to suitably diluted aliquots of the injected material. The total activity of the blood was calculated under the assumption that it is 7% of the total body weight. The % dose/g of samples was calculated by comparing the sample counts with the count of the diluted initial dose.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nFilm Autoradiography\n\n\n \n \n \n[\n18\nF]tracers: Brain sections from AD subjects were obtained by freezing the brain in powdered dry ice and cut into 20 micrometer-thick sections. The sections were incubated with [\n18\nF]tracers (200,000-250,000 cpm/200 μl) for 1 hr at room temperature. The sections were then dipped in saturated Li\n2\nCO3 in 40% EtOH (two two-minute washes) and washed with 40% EtOH (one two-minute wash) followed by rinsing with water for 30 sec. After drying, the \n18\nF-labeled sections were exposed to Kodak MR film overnight. The results are depicted in the film in \nFIG. 2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[\n125\nI]tracers: To compare different probes using similar sections of human brain tissue, human macro-array brain sections from 6 confirmed AD cases and one control subject were assembled. The presence and localization of plaques on the sections was confirmed with immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal Aβ antibody 4G8 (Sigma). The sections were incubated with [\n125\nI]tracers (200,000-250,000 cpm/200 μL) for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were then dipped in saturated Li\n2\nCO\n3 \nin 40% EtOH (two two-minute washes) and washed with 40% EtOH (one two-minute wash) followed by rinsing with water for 30 sec. After drying, the \n125\nI-labeled sections were exposed to Kodak Biomax MR film overnight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA macro-array block was constructed using postmortem human brain samples consisting of seven confirmed AD cases. After sectioning of this macro-array block, adjacent sections, which reflect a comparable pathophysiology, were used. In vitro film autoradiography was carried out using these novel \n125\nI or \n18\nF labeled diphenyltriazole probes. Among the probes examined, [\n18\nF]17a and [\n18\nF]17b exhibited the most distinctive Aβ plaque-labeling and a minimal level of background in the white matter areas of AD brain (\nFIG. 5\n). The labeling pattern was consistent with that observed by immunohistochemical labeling with an antibody (4G8) specific for Aβ (data not shown). In addition to plaque labeling, [\n125\nI]10a, displayed a significant white matter labeling (\nFIG. 5\n) under a similar incubation condition. Similar pattern was also observed for the radioiodinated N,N′-dimethylated probe [\n125\nI]10b (data not shown). The higher background labeling observed for [\n125\nI]10a and [\n125\nI]10b may be related to their higher lipophilicity (log P=3.0 and 3.4, respectively).\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nPartition Coefficient\n\n\n \n \n \nPartition coefficients were measured by mixing the [\n125\nI] or [\n18\nF]tracer with 3 g each of 1-octanol and buffer (0.1 M phosphate, pH 7.4) in a test tube. The test tube was vortexed for 3 min at room temperature, followed by centrifugation for 5 min. Two weighed samples (0.5 g each) from the 1-octanol and buffer layers were counted in a well counter. The partition coefficient was determined by calculating the ratio of cpm/g of 1-octanol to that of buffer. Samples from the 1-octanol layer were re-partitioned until consistent partitions of coefficient values were obtained. The measurement was done in triplicate and repeated three times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA moderate lipophilicity (log P=1-3.5) will be considered as a highly desirable property. The radiofluorinated diphenyltriazoles [\n18\nF]17a and [\n18\nF]17b showed lower PC (log P=2.7) as compared to the two radioiodinated triazoles, [\n125\nI]10a and [\n125\nI]10b showing a log P of 3.0 and 3.4, respectively.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nBiodistribution\n\n\n \n \n \nWhole animal distribution evaluated in normal mice for these radiolabeled triazoles displayed excellent initial brain penetrations (6-9.5% dose/g at 2 min) (\nFIG. 3\n). The initial high brain uptakes (at 2 min after the injection) observed for these radiolabeled probes, especially for radioiodinated probes [\n125\nI]10a and [\n125\nI]10b, were subsequently followed by rapidly washout with less than 0.5% dose/g remaining in the brain at 2 hr after the injection (\nFIG. 4\n). [\n18\nF]17a and [\n18\nF]17b appears to show a fast washouts initial, then followed by a gradual and slower rates of clearance from the mouse brain, resulting in a higher residual radioactivity remaining (1-2% dose/g at 2 hr after tracer injection). Thus, the two iodinated probes. [\n125\nI]10a and [\n125\nI]10b resulted in higher and better brain washout indexes (brain\n2 min\n/brain\n30 min\n) of 5.66 and 3.72, respectively which are more favorable compared to [\n18\nF]17a and [\n18\nF]17b with lower indexes of 2.34 and 2.31, respectively for Aβ plaque detection. A significant amount of in vivo defluorination (reflected by bone uptake) observed with [\n18\nF]17a (4.64% dose/g, supporting data) and [\n18\nF]17b (18.59% dose/g, supporting data). These values are 5 to 10 times higher as compared to the values reported for the previous PET ligands.

Because SPECT agents labeled with \n123\nI have long half-lives (approximately 13 hours) they can be prepared centrally, reducing the potential cost and variability involved with regional or on-site radiosynthesis. These inherent advantages, together with the excellent amyloid binding properties of \n123\nI-33, provide a strong rationale for testing \n123\nI-33 as an Aβ imaging agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound 33 shows high affinity and specific binding to amyloid plaques, as demonstrated by competitive binding studies using the known amyloid binding agent \n125\nI-IMPY (6-iodo-2-(4′-dimethylamino-)phenyl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine). In these experiments Compound 33 showed a Ki of 7.5±0.5 nM, comparable to other experimental amyloid imaging agents. \n123\nI-33, when applied at tracer concentrations, specifically labeled Aβ plaques in sections from patients with pathologically confirmed AD.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacological properties of Compound 33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBinding\n\n\n \n\n\nBiodistribution in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBinding\n\n\nAffinity\n\n\n \n\n\nMice (% dose/g in brain)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTarget\n\n\n(Ki, nM)\n\n\n \nSelectivity\n \n\n\n2 \nmin\n \n\n\n60 min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nAmyloid\n\n\n7.5 ± 0.5\n\n\nNo high\n\n\n3.69 ± 0.14\n\n\n0.25 ± 0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\nPlaque\n\n\n \n\n\naffinity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nbinding to any\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCNS receptors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn mouse in-vivo experiments \n123\nI-33 showed appropriate biodistribution for a brain imaging agent. When administered i.v. to male mice, \n123\nI-33 entered the brain quickly and reached a peak brain concentration of 3.7% dose/g within 2 min post administration and fell to 0.25% dose/g within 60 min. Similar results were seen in female mice. An estimate of human dosimetry, based on extrapolation from the mouse data, suggests that the dose-limiting organs (assuming thyroid blocking) will be the intestines. At the proposed 5 mCi human dose the lower large intestine is estimated to receive approximately 3.8 rem, while the upper large intestine is estimated to receive approximately 3.3 rem of exposure. The estimated human effective dose (ED) of approximately 1.26 rem is comparable to that for recommended doses of other \n123\nI-labeled SPECT imaging radiopharmaceuticals such as \n123\nI-MIBG, \n123\nI-IMPY, and \n123\nI-βCIT.\n\n\n \nBinding Affinity of Compound 33 in AD Brain Homogenates, as Measured by Inhibition of \n125\nI-IMPY  Binding\n\n\n \n \n \nPostmortem brain tissue was obtained and neuropathological diagnosis was confirmed in accordance with the NIA-Reagan Institute Consensus Group criteria. Homogenates were then prepared from dissected gray matter, pooled in phosphate buffered saline and aliquoted into 1-ml portions (100 mg wet tissue/ml), which could be stored at −70° C. for 3-6 months without loss of binding signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the binding assays brain homogenates were incubated with \n125\nI-IMPY (0.04-0.06 nM diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) and test compound (10\n−5\n-10\n−10 \nM diluted in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)). Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of IMPY (600 nM). The bound and free radioactivity was separated by vacuum filtration followed by 2×3 ml washes of PBS. Filters containing the bound \n125\nI ligand were assayed in a gamma counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound 33 potently inhibited \n125\nI-IMPY binding in this assay, with a Ki=7.5±0.5 nM.

The percentage dose per organ was calculated by a comparison of the tissue counts to suitably diluted aliquots of the injected material. Total activities of blood were calculated under the assumption that they were 7% of the total body weight. The % dose/g of samples was calculated by comparing the sample counts with the count of the diluted initial dose.

The partition coefficient for \n123\nI-33 was determined to be 1788 (log P=3.25).\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nBiodistribution in ICR Mice After an iv Injection of [\n18\nF]17b in 0.1% BSA/<1% Ethanol in Water\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrgan\n\n\n2 min\n\n\n30 min\n\n\n1 hr\n\n\n2 hr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(% dose/organ, avg of 3 mice ± SD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood\n\n\n4.62 ± 0.37\n\n\n3.74 ± 0.14\n\n\n4.33 ± 0.49\n\n\n2.04 ± 0.21\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeart\n\n\n0.91 ± 0.28\n\n\n0.30 ± 0.04\n\n\n0.24 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.11 ± 0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuscle\n\n\n10.01 ± 2.92 \n\n\n12.79 ± 0.74 \n\n\n12.87 ± 1.11 \n\n\n5.73 ± 0.34\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLung\n\n\n1.76 ± 0.15\n\n\n0.67 ± 0.08\n\n\n0.53 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.22 ± 0.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKidney\n\n\n4.71 ± 0.29\n\n\n1.64 ± 0.24\n\n\n1.34 ± 0.23\n\n\n0.51 ± 0.06\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpleen\n\n\n0.36 ± 0.14\n\n\n0.26 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.23 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.09 ± 0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiver\n\n\n17.24 ± 0.83 \n\n\n14.03 ± 0.92 \n\n\n9.64 ± 0.61\n\n\n3.89 ± 0.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkin\n\n\n2.76 ± 0.79\n\n\n6.31 ± 0.23\n\n\n5.87 ± 0.55\n\n\n2.43 ± 0.20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrain\n\n\n4.45 ± 0.62\n\n\n0.74 ± 0.06\n\n\n0.78 ± 0.08\n\n\n0.44 ± 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone\n\n\n5.69 ± 2.05\n\n\n5.03 ± 0.38\n\n\n8.04 ± 1.53\n\n\n8.12 ± 0.94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(% dose/g, avg of 3 mice ± SD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood\n\n\n3.14 ±0.46 \n\n\n2.50 ± 0.28\n\n\n2.74 ± 0.32\n\n\n1.35 ± 0.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeart\n\n\n9.47 ± 3.41\n\n\n2.88 ± 0.40\n\n\n2.35 ± 0.29\n\n\n1.04 ± 0.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuscle\n\n\n1.18 ± 0.34\n\n\n1.49 ± 0.08\n\n\n1.43 ± 0.13\n\n\n0.66 ± 0.07\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLung\n\n\n10.66 ± 1.26 \n\n\n3.79 ± 0.68\n\n\n2.88 ± 0.21\n\n\n1.23 ± 0.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKidney\n\n\n15.54 ± 2.94 \n\n\n5.02 ± 0.75\n\n\n3.74 ± 0.42\n\n\n1.46 ± 0.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpleen\n\n\n3.70 ± 1.29\n\n\n2.53 ± 0.37\n\n\n2.11 ± 0.18\n\n\n0.92 ± 0.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiver\n\n\n15.82 ± 2.23 \n\n\n13.10 ± 1.25 \n\n\n8.68 ± 0.58\n\n\n3.50 ± 0.82\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkin\n\n\n0.88 ± 0.29\n\n\n1.97 ± 0.14\n\n\n1.73 ± 0.18\n\n\n0.75 ± 0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrain\n\n\n10.28 ± 1.79 \n\n\n1.61 ± 0.16\n\n\n1.68 ± 0.20\n\n\n0.99 ± 0.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone\n\n\n1.91 ± 0.63\n\n\n1.69 ± 0.27\n\n\n2.55 ± 0.50\n\n\n2.67 ± 0.07\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 9 \n\n\n \n \n \nA compound of the present invention is tested in an established in-vitro immunoblot assay for its ability to inhibit the formation of Aβ oligomers and fibrils (Yang F, Liim G P, Begum A N et al. Curcumin inhibits formation of amyloid β oligomers and fibrils, binds plaques, and reduces amyloid in-vivo. \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n280:5892-5901, 2005). Curcumin, a natural molecule serves as positive control. Compounds of this invention are able to inhibit the aggregation Aβ in a manner similar to Curcumin at concentrations of 1-100 μM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood to those of ordinary skill in the art that the same can be performed within a wide and equivalent range of conditions, formulations, and other parameters without affecting the scope of the invention or any embodiment thereof.
