Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to new dopamine D\n3\n and D\n2\n receptor subtype preferring ligands of formula (I) and/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates thereof. The invention also relates to processes for preparing the same, to compositions containing the same and to their use in the treatment and/or prevention of conditions which requires modulation of dopamine receptors.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCyclohexane derivatives that are useful as therapeutics for the treatment of pain are described in International Patent Publication No. \n \nWO 99/67206\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds containing a cyclohexane, pyrimidine and piperazine ring are described in European Patent No. \n \nEP 431,580\n \n and \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,957,921\n \n. These compounds act as central nervous system agents and dopaminergic agents, respectively. These compounds, however, do not contain an alkyl-amino group in the 2-position of the pyrimidine ring. Dopamine D\n3\n receptor modulator compounds containing a pyrimidine and piperazine ring are described in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/259882\n \n. These compounds do not, however, contain a cyclohexane ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWO 2005/012266 A\n \n and \nJ. Med. Chem., Vol. 41, No. 5,1998, pages 760-771\n also describe D2/D3 dopamine receptor ligands having a cyclohexyl-piperazinyl skeleton.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nUS-A-4 051 244\n \n describes antipsychotic compounds having a 2-amino-5,6-di-halogenopyrimidin-4-yl group.\n\n2-Amino-6-chloro-4-(N-methylpiperazino)pyrimidines as inhibitors of spiroperidol binding are described in, e.g., \nJ. Med. Chem., 25, 1459, (1982\n).\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSurprisingly, it has been found that in contrast to the compounds described above, the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention have high or very high affinity for dopamine D\n3\n receptors, and moderate to high affinity for dopamine D\n2\n receptors always in such a combination that the D\n3\n affinity is 5 to 50 fold higher than the D\n2\n affinity. In addition, the compounds of the present invention show even higher selectivity over other receptors. For example, these compounds do not show affinity for alpha-1 adrenoceptors, i.e., their inhibitor constants (Ki) are higher or much higher than 1000 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dual (\ni.e\n. D\n3\n and D\n2\n) receptor functional antagonism coupled in the above mentioned particular proportion is especially important as it allows the simultaneous manifestation of the beneficial modulation of both D\n3\n and D\n2\n receptors, however, without the appearance of the known disadvantages of each individual receptor action.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) will be referred to in this application as \"D\n3\n/D\n2\n ligands\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to new piperazine derivatives of formula (I):\n\n \n \n\nwherein\n\nQ represents C\n1-4\n alkyl, -NR\n3\nR\n4\n, Phenyl, optionally substituted phenyl, 1-pyrrolidinyl, 1-piperidinyl, 4-R\n5\n-piperazin-1-yl or 4-morpholinyl group;\n\nR\n1\n represents hydrogen or C\n1-4\n alkyl group;\n\nR\n2\n represents hydrogen or C\n1-4\n alkyl group;\n\nR\n3\n represents hydrogen, C\n1-4\n alkyl group, phenyl or optionally substituted phenyl;\n\nR\n4\n represents hydrogen, C\n1-4\n alkyl group, phenyl or optionally substituted phenyl;\n\nR\n5\n represents hydrogen or C\n1-4\n alkyl group;\n\nand/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates thereof, to processes for preparing the same, to pharmacological compositions containing the same and to their use in the treatment and/or prevention of pathological conditions which require the modulation of dopamine receptors, such as, but not limited to, psychoses (\ne.g\n. schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorders), drug (\ne.g\n. alcohol, cocaine, nicotine, opioids) abuse, cognitive impairment accompanying schizophrenia, mild-to-moderate cognitive deficits, dementia, psychotic states associated with dementia, eating disorders (\ne.g\n, bulimia nervosa, etc.), attention deficit disorders, hyperactivity disorders, psychotic depression, mania, bipolar disorder, paranoid and delusional disorders, dyskinetic disorders (\ne.g\n. Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic induced parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia), depression and depressive states, anxiety disorders, sexual dysfunctions (eg. erectile dysfunctions), sleep disorders, emesis, aggression, autism and pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to compounds of formula (III):\n\n \n \n\nwherein\n\nR\n1\n represents hydrogen or C\n1-4\n alkyl group, and\n\nR\n2\n represents hydrogen or C\n1-4\n alkyl group.\n\n\n \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the present invention relates to compounds of formula (I):\n\n \n \n\nwherein\n\nQ represents C\n1-4\n alkyl, -NR\n3\nR\n4\n, phenyl, optionally substituted phenyl, 1-pyrrolidinyl, 1-piperidinyl, 4-R\n5\n-piperazin-1-yl or 4-morpholinyl group;\n\nR\n1\n represents hydrogen or C\n1-4\n alkyl group;\n\nR\n2\n represents hydrogen or C\n1-4\n alkyl group;\n\nR\n3\n represents hydrogen, C\n1-4\n alkyl group, phenyl or optionally substituted phenyl;\n\nR\n4\n represents hydrogen, C\n1-4\n alkyl group, phenyl or optionally substituted phenyl;\n\nR\n5\n represents hydrogen or C\n1-4\n alkyl group;\n\nand/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term \"optionally substituted phenyl\" as used herein means a phenyl group which can be substituted in any position by one or more halogen, C\n1-4\n alkyl, C\n1-4\n alkoxy, trifluoromethyl and/or cyano group, or combinations thereof\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to salts of compounds of formula (I) formed with acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth organic and inorganic acids can be used for the formation of acid addition salts. Suitable inorganic acids include, but are not limited to, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid. Representatives of monovalent organic acids include, but are not limited to, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and different butyric acids, valeric acids and capric acids. Representatives of bivalent organic acids include, but are not limited to, oxalic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid and succinic acid. Other organic acids can also be used, such as hydroxy acids, for example, citric acid, tartaric acid, or aromatic carboxylic acids, for example, benzoic acid or salicylic acid, as well as aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, for example, methanesulfonic acid, naphtalenesulfonic acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid. A preferred group of acid addition salts are those in which the acid component itself is physiologically acceptable and does not have a therapeutic effect in the applied dose and/or it does not have unfavourable influence on the effect of the active ingredient. These acid addition salts are pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Acid addition salts which are not pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be advantageous in the purification and isolation of the desired compounds of formula (I), and are therefore also included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolvates and/or hydrates of compounds of formula (I), as well as solvates and/or hydrates of salts of compounds of formula (1) are also included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that compounds of Formula I can exist in different tautomeric and geometrical isomeric forms. For example, the compounds of formula (I) exist in the form of \ncis\n and \ntrans\n isomers with respect to the configuration of the cyclohexane ring. The compounds of present invention are preferably in the \ntrans\n configuration. In addition, certain compounds of formula (I) can exist as stereoisomers and diastereomers. All of these compounds, including \ncis\n isomers, \ntrans\n isomers, diastereomic mixtures, racemates, nonracemic mixtures of enantiomers, substantially pure, and pure enantiomers, are within the scope of the present invention. Substantially pure enantiomers contain no more than 5% w/w of the corresponding opposite enantiomer, preferably no more than 2%, most preferably no more than 1%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional processes, for example, by the formation of diastereoisomeric salts using an optically active acid or base or formation of covalent diastereomers. Examples of appropriate acids are tartaric, diacetyltartaric, dibenzoyltartaric, ditoluoyltartaric and camphorsulfonic acid. Mixtures of diastereoisomers can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical and/or chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. The optically active bases or acids are then liberated from the separated diastereomeric salts. A different process for separation of optical isomers involves the use of chiral chromatography (e.g., chiral HPLC columns), with or without conventional derivation, optimally chosen to maximize the separation of the enantiomers. Suitable chiral HPLC columns are manufactured by Diacel, e.g., Chiracel OD and Chiracel OJ among many others, all routinely selectable. Enzymatic separations, with or without derivitization, are also useful. The optically active compounds of formulas (I) can likewise be obtained by utilizing optically active starting materials in chiral synthesis processes under reaction conditions which do not cause racemization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein in the present specification and claims a \"compound of formula (I)\" will be deemed to encompass both the free base and salts, e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable salts, thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, preferred compounds of the invention are those compounds of formula (I) wherein\n\nQ represents C\n1-4\n alkyl, NR\n3\nR\n4\n or 4-morpholinyl group,\n\nR\n1\n represents hydrogen or C\n1-4\n alkyl group;\n\nR\n2\n represents hydrogen or C\n1-4\n alkyl group;\n\nR\n3\n represents hydrogen or C\n1-4\n alkyl group;\n\nR\n4\n

The compounds are expected to be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of disease states in which D\n3\n and/or D\n2\n receptors are involved in the disease pathology and thus their modulation is required, or in which modulation of D\n3\n and/or D\n2\n receptors exerts beneficial effect on the state and/or process of the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDysfunction of the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system is involved in the pathology of several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as schizophrenia, mania, bipolar disorders, drug abuse, dementia, cognitive dysfunctions, and Parkinson's disease. The effects of neurotransmitter dopamine is mediated via at least five distinct dopamine receptors belonging to D1- (\ni.e\n. D\n1\n and D\n5\n) or D\n2\n- (\ni.e\n. D\n2\n, D\n3\n and D\n4\n) families. D\n3\n receptors have been shown to have characteristic distribution in the mammalian brain. Namely, they were found in high densities in certain limbic structures such as nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and islands of Calleja. Therefore, preferential targeting of the D\n3\n receptors may be a promising approach for more selective modulation of certain dopaminergic functions and consequently offers successful therapeutic interventions in several abnormalities such as schizophrenia, emotional or cognitive dysfunctions (see, \ne.g\n.,\n Sokoloff, P. et al.: Nature 1990, 347:146\n; \nSchwartz, J.C. et al.: Clin. Neuropharmacol. 1993, 16:295\n; \nSchwartz, J.C. et al.: Brain Res. Rev. 2000, 31:277\n; \nLevant, B.: Pharmacol, Rev. 1997, 49:231\n; \nLaszy, J. et al.: Psychopharmacol. 2005, 179:567\n), drug abuse (see, \ne.g\n., \nPilla, C. et al.: Nature 199, 400:371\n; \nHeidbreder, C.A. et al.: Brain Res. Rev. 2005, 49:77\n), Parkinson's disease (see, \ne.g\n., \nLevant, B. et al.: CNS Drugs 1999, 12:391\n; \nJoyce, J.N.: Pharmacol. Therap. 2001, 90:231\n; \nBézard, E. et al.: Nature Medicine 2003, 9:762\n) and pain (see, \ne.g\n., \nLevant, B. et al.: Neurosci. Lett. 2001, 303:9\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dopamine D\n2\n receptors are widely distributed in the brain and are known to be involved in numerous physiological functions and pathological states. D\n2\n antagonists are, for example, widely used as antipsychotics. However, it is also well known that massive antagonism of the D\n2\n receptors leads to unwanted side effects, such as extrapyramidal motor symptoms, psychomotor sedation, cognitive blunting and endocrine alterations. These side effects seriously restrict the therapeutic utilization of D\n2\n antagonist compounds (see, \ne.g\n, \nWong, A.H.C. et al.: Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2003, 27:269\n.; \nStahl, S.M. 2002, Essential Psychopharmacology. Neuroscientific Basis and Practical Applications. 2nd Ed. Cambridge University Press\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCardiovascular side effects (such as orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia and sometimes syncope) of the first generation antipsychotics (\ne.g\n. chlorpromazine, thioridazine, chlorprothixene) and second generation antipsychotics (\ne.g\n. olanzapine, risperidone) are well documented (see, \ne.g.,\n \nPacher, P. and Kecskeméti, V.: Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004, 10:2463\n; .\nBrunton,L., Lazo, J, and Parker, K. (eds) Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11th Edition, Mc Graw Hill, 2005, p.462\n.; \nStahl, S.M. 2002, Essential Psychopharmacology. Neuroscientific Basis and Practical Applications. 2nd Ed. p. 409, Cambridge University Press, 2000\n; http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2006/Sep_PIs/RisperdalConsta_PI.pdf; https/www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2006/Aug_PIs/Zyprexa_PI.pdf). Side effects of this sort hamper or seriously limit the antipsychotic therapy especially in the initial period. All the above mentioned first and second generation antipsychotics show considerable (\ni.e\n. nanomolar) affinities to adrenergic alpha-1 receptors and it is a common view that the majority of their cardiovascular side effects are mainly related to their alpha-1 antagonist actions. Thus, the lack of adrenergic alpha-1 activity is a highly desirable feature of a potential antipsychotic compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides novel compounds of formula (I) and/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates thereof which have high affinity for dopamine D\n3\n receptors (Ki values less than 3 nM) and, simultaneously, have high-to-moderate affinity for dopamine D\n2\n receptors (Ki values of 10 to 50 nM) always in a such combination that the D\n3\n affinity is 5 to 50-times higher than the D\n2\n affinity. In addition, compounds of formula (I) have no affinity to adrenergic alpha-1 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the present invention provides for the use of a compound of formula (I) and/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates thereof in treating conditions which require preferential modulation of dopamine D\n3\n and/or D\n2\n receptors, such as, but not limited to, psychoses (\ne.g\n. schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorders), cognitive impairment accompanying schizophrenia, mild-to-moderate cognitive deficits, dementia, psychotic states associated with dementia, psychotic depression, mania, bipolar disorder, paranoid and delusional disorders, dyskinetic disorders such as Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic induced parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, eating disorders (\ne.g\n. bulimia nervosa), attention deficit disorders, hyperactivity disorders, depression and depressive states, anxiety disorders, sexual dysfunctions (\ne.g\n. erectile dysfunctions), sleep disorders, emesis, aggression, autism, drug (\ne.g\n. alcohol, cocaine, nicotine, opioids) abuse and pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides the use of a compound of formula (I) and/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of conditions which require modulation of dopamine receptors, especially dopamine D\n3\n and/or D\n2\n receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA preferred use for D\n3\n/D\n2\n ligands according to the present invention is in the treatment of schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorders, cognitive impairment accompanying schizophrenia, mild-to-moderate cognitive deficits, dementia, psychotic states associated with dementia, psychotic depression, mania, bipolar disorder, paranoid and delusional disorders, dyskinetic disorders such as Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic induced parkinsonism, depression and depressive states, anxiety disorders, and drug abuse (\ne.g\n. cocaine abuse).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particular combination of the two receptor-actions described above allows the simultaneous manifestation of the beneficial actions of D\n3\n functional antagonism (\ne.g\n. cognitive enhancer effect, inhibition of extrapyramidal motor symptoms, inhibitory action on drug abuse) and that of the D\n2\n functional antagonism (\ne.g\n. antipsychotic effect). Furthermore, the same combination surprisingly results in cancelling out the disadvantageous features of D\n2\n antagonism (\ne.g\n. extrapyramidal symptoms, psychomotor sedation, cognitive disturbances).\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention will now be further described by way of the following examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure of all intermediates and end products were elucidated by IR, NMR and MS spectroscopy.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\n\n \n4-(5,6-dichloro-2-methylamino-pyrimidin4-yl)-piperazine-1-carboxyclic acid tert-butyl ester\n (intermediate compound 1a)\n\n\n \n \n \nMethyl-(4,5,6-trichloro-pyrimidin-2-yl)-amine (2.8 g, 12.2 mmol), 1-Boc-piperazine (2.27 g, 12.2 mmol), potassium carbonate (0.84 g 6.1 mmol) in water (2.5 ml) and methyl ethyl ketone (50 ml) were refluxed for 12 hours.

Amphetamine-Induced Hypermotility\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nOne hour after the oral administration of doses of the test compound or vehicle, male Wistar rats were subcutaneously treated with d-amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg, sc.) and were individually placed in activity cages for one hour. Locomotor activity was measured in a four-channel activity monitor equipped with infrared photobeams Horizontal movement was determined as the number of beam interruptions. Mean ± SE of horizontal activity data of each group was calculated. Percent inhibition of amphetamine-induced increase in locomotion was calculated for each dose of the tested compound. The ED-50 value was determined by linear regression fitted to the dose-response plot.\n\n\n \n\n\n5. Catalepsy Test\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThirty minutes after the oral treatment with the test compounds male Wistar rats weighing 200-220 g (n=10/group) were placed in extra-ordinary position: placing both forepaws of the rat on a 10 cm high podium. Animals were considered to be cataleptic if they did not correct their body posture within 30 sec. The frequency of cataleptic animals was determined at one, two, three, four and five hours after the treatment. Minimum effective (cataleptic) dose was defined as the dose causing catalepsy at least at two readings (\ni.e\n. either at two time points in the same animal or in two different animals at any of the time points).\n\n\n \n\n\n6. Scopolamine-Induced Learning Disturbance in the Water-Labyrinth\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe learning process of rats was assessed in a 3-choice point water-labyrinth system. The number of directional turning errors was recorded in three daily trials for three experimental days. Male Wistar rats weighing 180-200 g (n=10 per groups) were treated orally with vehicle or the test compounds 1 hour before each daily session. Scopolamine (3 mg/kg ip.) as amnestic agent was injected 30 minutes prior to the first daily trial. Mean ± SE of errors committed in all the trials was calculated in each group.

The former two are the result of massive blockade of D\n2\n receptors in the basal ganglia whereas the latter is the consequence of antagonism of alpha-1 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs can be seen from Table 1, the compounds of the present invention are very highly potent ligands at D\n3\n receptors (Ki values are less than 3 nM) and moderately potent ligands at dopamine D\n2\n receptors (Ki values between 5 and 50 nM) showing 5 to 50 fold selectivity for D\n3\n over D\n2\n receptors. Coupling the very high D\n3\n affinity to the moderate D\n2\n affinity in this particular proportion allows the beneficial (\ne.g\n. antipsychotic) actions of a D\n2\n antagonist to be preserved, while at the same time, impeding (by the D\n3\n effects) the appearance of the disadvantageous consequences of massive D\n2\n receptor blockade, such as extrapyramidal symptoms or cognitive disturbances. It is therefore anticipated that no or greatly diminished adverse effects related to D\n2\n receptors will occur in the course of therapeutical application of compounds of the present invention. Furthermore, as well as favourably modulating the dopamine D\n2\n receptor-mediated functions, action of the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention on dopamine D\n3\n receptors will also result in additional therapeutically beneficial effects \ne.g\n. cognitive improvement, diminution of negative and depressive symptoms. In addition, the compounds have no affinity to adrenergic alpha-1 receptors (Ki values are higher than 1000 nM for each compound) and thus have extremely high D\n3\n/alpha-1 selectivity. From the lack of affinity of the compounds to adrenergic alpha-1 receptors the lack of cardiovascular side effects (\ne.g\n. orthostatic hypotension and associated symptoms such as dizziness, tachycardia) is anticipated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe beneficial effects of the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention carrying the above described particular combination of D\n3\n and D\n2\n receptor binding affinities were demonstrated \nin vivo,\n in methods used to measure antipsychotic effect (amphetamine hypermotility), cognitive enhancer activity (scopolamine-induced learning disturbance) and extrapyramidal side-effect (catalepsy test).The results are shown in Tables 2 and 3.\n\n \n \nTable 2\n \n \n \n \n \nEffects of compounds of formula (I) on amphetamine-induced hypermotility and in the catalepsy test\n \n \n \n \ncompound\n \nInhibition of amphetamine-induced hypermotility (ED50, mg/kg)\n \nCatalepsy (MED, mg/kg)\n \nTI\na\n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n0.14\n \n100\n \n714\n \n \n \n8\n \n0.14\n \n>25\n \n>179\n \n \n \nOlanzapine\n \n1.8\n \n40\n \n22\n \n \n \nRisperidone\n \n0.15\n \n6.0\n \n40\n \n \n \n \n \na: therapeutic index - catalepsy MED divided by amphetamine hypermotility ED50\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs can be seen from Table 2, compounds of formula (I) of the present invention have highly potent antipsychotic activity (inhibition of amphetamine-induced hypermotility) as can be predicted from their high to moderate dopamine D\n2\n receptor affinities. With regard to cataleptogenic (\ni.e\n. extrapyramidal side effect-inducing) potential, compounds of formula (I) of the present invention are highly superior to the reference drugs olanzapine and risperidone both in absolute (MED) and relative (TI) terms. Since olanzapine and risperidone show equal binding affinity to the D\n3\n and D\n2\n dopamine receptors (see Table 1) whereas compounds of formula (I) of the present invention preferably bind to the D\n3\n receptor (their D\n3\n affinity is 5 to 50 fold higher than the D\n2\n affinity) in such a way that they have high or very high affinity to dopamine D\n3\n receptors and moderate to high affinity to dopamine D\n2\n receptors, the results of Table 2 also demonstrate that such particular combination of D\n3\n and D\n2\n affinities indeed result in preservation of the beneficial antipsychotic action with simultaneous elimination of the disadvantageous extrapyramidal side-effect (catalepsy).\n\n \n \nTable 3\n \n \n \n \n \nEffects of compounds of formula (I) on scopolamine-induced learning disturbance\n \n \n \n \nCompound\n \nDose (mg/kg)\n \n% inhibition\na\n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n0.1\n \n36\n \n \n \n \n \n0.2\n \n58\n \n \n \n \n \n0.4\n \n61\n \n \n \n \n \n0.8\n \n44\n \n \n \n8\n \n0.025\n \n38\n \n \n \n \n \n0.05\n \n65\n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n31\n \n \n \nOlanzapine\n \n1\n \n \n-12\n \n \n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \n-49\n \n \n \n \nRisperidone\n \n0.5\n \n \n-15\n \n \n \n \n \n \na: negative values mean further \nimpairment\n in learning performance\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nData in Table 3 show that compounds of formula (I) of the present invention do exert cognitive enhancing effect (as evidenced by the considerable inhibition of the learning disrupting effect of scopolamine) in contrast to olanzapine and risperidone which further impaired rather than improved the learning performance of scopolamine treated animals. These findings demonstrate the beneficial effect of the very high to high D\n3\n receptor affinity characteristic for the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention and also point to the importance of the particular 5 to 50-fold D\n3\n/D\n2\n selectivity ratio possessed by these compounds. In the case of risperidone and olanzapine, compounds which showed equal affinity to the D\n3\n and D\n2\n receptors, the deleterious effect of D\n2\n antagonism on learning overcame the beneficial cognitive action of D\n3\n antagonism while in case of compounds of formula (I) of the present invention the 5 to 50-fold higher D\n3\n receptor affinity cancelled out the disadvantageous effect (cognitive disturbance in this case) of D\n2\n antagonism."
