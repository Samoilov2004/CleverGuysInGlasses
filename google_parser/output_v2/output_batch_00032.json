Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to melanin-concentrating hormone receptor antagonists and derivatives thereof. The antagonists and derivatives thereof are useful for the treatment of obesity, hyperphagia, anxiety, depression and related disorders and diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMelanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a cyclic peptide that was first isolated from the pituitary of chum salmon (\nKawauchi et al. (1983) Nature 305: 321-333\n). The sequence for MCH has been shown to be identical in all teleost fish where it causes melanin granulation and, hence, regulates color change. Recent reports also suggest MCH plays a role in food intake in teleosts. MCH also inhibits release of ACTH thus acting as an antagonist of α-MSH. MCH was subsequently identified in mammals as a cyclic nonapeptide. The first MCH receptor (later termed MCHR1) is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) and was identified using a \"reverse pharmacology\" approach. That is, it was demonstrated that the natural ligand of orphan GPCR, SLC-1, was MCH in mammals. Subsequent to this determination, a second MCH receptor (MCHR-2) has been identified. The role of MCH in feeding behavior in mammals has been the subject of investigation for a number of years (\nQu, et al. (1996) Nature, 380: 243-247\n; \nRossi et al. (1997) Endocrinology 138: 351-355\n; \nShimada et al. (1998) Nature 396: 670-674\n). MCH is predominantly expressed in the lateral hypothalamus and the \nzona incerta\n of the central nervous system (CNS). Central administration of MCH is known to stimulate food intake and regulate energy balance. MCH is upregulated in the lateral hypothalamus during fasting (\nRossi et al. (1997) Endocrinology 138: 351-355\n). Knockout experiments have shown that mice lacking the MCH peptide are lean, hypophagic and maintained elevated metabolic rates. MCH mRNA levels are increased in both normal and obese mice. Transgenic mice that over-express MCH are obese and insulin resistant. Genetically altered animals that lack the gene encoding the MCH receptor are moderately hyperphagic but show resistance to becoming obese and have an increased metabolic rate (\nShimada et al. (1998) Nature 396: 670-674\n). MCH is thought to exert its effects on feeding behavior by binding to an MCH receptor (MCHR1 or MCHR2) resulting in mobilization of intracellular calcium and a concomitant reduction in cyclic AMP levels. The consistency in these findings suggests that MCH antagonism could safely lead to weight loss in humans. In further support of this, a number of studies describe statistically significant reduction of food intake in rodents following acute administration of MCH receptor antagonists and/or statistically significant reduction of body weight after chronic administration of small molecule MCH receptor antagonists (\nBorowsky et al. (2002) Nature Medicine 8(8):825-830\n; \nSouers et al. (2005) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 15: 2752-2757\n; \nVasudevan et al. (2005) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 15: 4174-4179\n; \nKym et al. (2005) J. Med. Chem. 5888-91\n; \nMcBriar et al. (2005) J. Med. Chem. 48: 2274\n; \nTakekawa et al. (2002) Eur. J. Pharmacol. 438(3): 129-135\n; \nKowalski et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. (2004) 497: 41-47\n). The precise role of MCH in attenuating food intake is not clear from these studies because the small-molecule MCH receptor antagonists described are either 1) unselective for the MCH receptor or 2) no selectivity data is disclosed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMCHR1 antagonism with a small molecule is now recognized as a promising strategy for the treatment of obesity. The following relate to small-molecule MCH receptor antagonists: \n \nKato et al. WO2001/21577\n \n; \n \nChen et al. WO2002/089729\n \n; \n \nCollins et al. WO2003/105850\n \n; \n \nSouers et al. US2005/0137243\n \n; \n \nHulme et al. WO2005/019167\n \n; \n \nTempest et al. WO2005/019240\n \n; \n \nBarvian et al. W02004092181\n \n; \n \nBarvian et al. WO2005/042541\n \n; \n \nMcKittrick et al. WO2002/051809\n \n; \n \nSasikumar et al. WO2005/034947\n \n; \n \nDevita et al. WO2003/045313\n \n; \n \nGillig et al. WO2005/040257\n \n; \n \nSchwink et al. WO2004/072025\n \n and \n \nMoriya et al. WO 2004/031177\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMCH has been shown to modulate behaviors and disease states other than hyperphagia and obesity. MCHR1 antagonists have been shown to inhibit behavior in rodents that models depression and anxiety in humans (\nHervieu (2003) Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Targets 7(4), 495-511\n and references therein; \nGeorgescu et al. (2005) Journal of Neuroscience 25(11), 2933-2940\n; \nChaki et al. (2005) Journal of Pharm. and Exptl. Therapeutics 313, 831-839\n). These rodent models include forced swim test, vocalization and various models of social interaction. Recent studies also support a role of MCHR1 in cognition (\nAdamantidis et al. (2005) European Journal of Neuroscience 21, 2837-2844\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is still a need for selective MCH receptor antagonists in order to address the role of the MCH receptor in food intake and regulation of body weight. Unlike a number of existing medications for weight loss, it is believed that a selective MCH receptor antagonist would provide a means of safely reducing food intake and body weight in humans. Such selective MCH receptor antagonists would be useful for the treatment of, for example, obesity, hyperphagia, anxiety, depression and related disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, provided is a compound of the general formula\n\n \n \n\nwherein\n\n \n \n \nR\n1\n \n \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, halo and cyano;\n \nR\n2\n \n \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy and hydroxyalkyl;\n \nR\n3\n \n \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, lower alkylcarbonyl, aryl and heteroaryl;\n \nR\n4\n \n \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, lower alkyl, cycloalkyl, halo, lower haloalkyl and cyano;\n \nm\n \nis 1 or 2; and\n \nn\n \nis 0 or 1,\n \n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.\n    \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I), wherein\n\n \n \n \nR\n1\n \n \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, lower alkyl, halo and cyano;\n \nR\n2\n \n \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, lower alkyl, alkoxy and hydroxyalkyl;\n \nR\n3\n \n \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkylcarbonyl and aryl;\n \nR\n4\n \n \nis selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, lower alkyl, halo, lower haloalkyl and cyano;\n \nm\n \nis 1 or 2; and\n \nn\n \nis 0 or 1,\n \n\nand pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.\n    \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, a compound of formula (I) according to the invention is provided, wherein\n\n \n \n \nR\n1\n \n \nis lower alkyl, halo or cyano; and\n \nR\n3\n \n \nis hydrogen or lower alkyl.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nFurthermore, a compound of formula (I) according to the invention is provided, wherein\n\n \n \n \nR\n2\n \n \nis lower alkyl, alkoxy or hydroxyalkyl; and\n \nR\n4\n \n \nis halo or cyano.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, a compound of formula (I) according to the present invention is provided, wherein R\n1\n is lower alkyl, halo or cyano.

The compounds or compositions can thus be administered orally (e.g., buccal cavity), sublingually, parenterally (e.g., intramuscularly, intravenously, or subcutaneously), rectally (e.g., by suppositories or washings), transdermally (e.g., skin electroporation) or by inhalation (e.g., by aerosol), and in the form or solid, liquid or gaseous dosages, including tablets and suspensions. The administration can be conducted in a single unit dosage form with continuous therapy or in a single dose therapy ad libitum. The therapeutic composition can also be in the form of an oil emulsion or dispersion in conjunction with a lipophilic salt such as pamoic acid, or in the form of a biodegradable sustained-release composition for subcutaneous or intramuscular administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful pharmaceutical carriers for the preparation of the compositions hereof, can be solids, liquids or gases; thus, the compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, suppositories, powders, enterically coated or other protected formulations (e.g. binding on ion-exchange resins or packaging in lipid-protein vesicles), sustained release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, and the like. The carrier can be selected from the various oils including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, e.g., peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, and the like. Water, saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols are preferred liquid carriers, particularly (when isotonic with the blood) for injectable solutions. For example, formulations for intravenous administration comprise sterile aqueous solutions of the active ingredient(s) which are prepared by dissolving solid active ingredient(s) in water to produce an aqueous solution, and rendering the solution sterile. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose, talc, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene glycol, water, ethanol, and the like. The compositions may be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical additives such as preservatives, stabilizing agents, wetting or emulsifying agents, salts for adjusting osmotic pressure, buffers and the like. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulation are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will, in any event, contain an effective amount of the active compound together with a suitable carrier so as to prepare the proper dosage form for proper administration to the recipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical preparations can also contain preserving agents, solubilizing agents, stabilizing agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, sweetening agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, coating agents or antioxidants.

Such dosage will be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case including the specific compound(s) being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, as well as the patient being treated. The therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. Preferably, the therapeutically effective amount may be from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg per day, more preferably from about 0.3 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe daily dosage can be administered as a single dose or in divided doses, or for parenteral administration it may be given as continuous infusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the invention relates to a compound of formula (I) as defined above for use as therapeutic active substance, particularly as therapeutic active substance for the treatment of obesity, hyperphagia, anxiety, depression and related disorders and diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the invention relates to the use of a compound of formula (I) as defined above for the treatment of obesity, hyperphagia, anxiety, depression and related disorders and diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the invention relates to the use of a compound of formula (I) as defined above for the preparation of medicaments for the treatment of obesity, hyperphagia, anxiety, depression and related disorders and diseases.

The substituted benzene dicarboxylic acid i (X=H, F, Br, Cl, CF\n3\n) can be reduced to a diol which can be converted to dibromide ii. Alkylation of diethyl malonate with the dibromide ii followed by saponification can provide indan-2,2-dicarboxylic acid iii, which can be decarboxylated to produce substituted indan-2-carboxylic acids iv. The indan-2-carboxylic acid iv can be reduced to a corresponding alcohol v, which can be oxidized to generate the desired substituted indan-2-carbaldehyde vi.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe chiral 5-bromo-indan-2-carboxylic acid (iv where X = 5-Br) can be prepared from the corresponding indene through an asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation with a similar method to literature example (\n \nUS 5936000\n \n) to generate both (R) and (S)-enantiomers.

The same method can be applied to other ring systems.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the aminoindane \nxiv\n (prepared from indan-2-carboxylic acid \niv\n through Curtius rearrangement) can be coupled to N-Boc-4-aminocyclohexanone \nxiii\n through reductive amination to generate \ncis-\n and \ntrans\n-isomers xv which can be separated. Following the removal of the N-Boc group and nucleophilic aromatic substitution with fluoro-nitrobenzene vii, the indane-derived benzoimidazole \nxvii\n can be prepared through reduction and ring cyclization reactions using the same method described in Scheme 2.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\nPART I: PREPARATION OF PREFERRED INTERMEDIATES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \ntrans\n-3-(2,5-Dimethyl-benzoimidazol-1-yl)-cyclopentylamine; hydrochloride\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo a stirred solution of 1,3-cyclopropanediol (5 g, 49 mmol) and imidazole (5 g, 73.4 mmol) in DMF (20 mL) was added t-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (5.2 g, 34.5 mmol) and the mixture was stirred for 90 minutes at room temperature.

The competition reaction was started by adding final concentration (0.2 nM) [Phe\n13\n,[\n125\nI]Tyr\n19\n]-MCH (PerkinElmer). The final volume of the reaction was 90 µL per well. After 60 min incubation time at room temperature the reaction was stopped by rapid filtration over 96-well filter plates. Following termination of the binding reactions, the filters were washed with ice-cold binding buffer (4 × 200 µL), and were air dried for 30 min.
