Typically, such phosphorylation can dramatically change the function of the protein and thus protein kinases can be pivotal in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular process, including metabolism, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell survival. The mechanism of these cellular processes provides a basis for targeting protein kinases to treat disease conditions resulting from or involving disorder of these cellular processes. Examples of such diseases include, but are not limited to, cancer and diabetes.\n\n\nProtein kinases can be broken into two types, protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and serine-threonine kinases (STKs). Both PTKs and STKs can be receptor protein kinases or non-receptor protein kinases. PAK is a family of non-receptor STKs. The p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) family of serine/threonine protein kinases plays important roles in cytoskeletal organization and cellular morphogenesis (Daniels et al., \nTrends Biochem. Sci. \n24: 350-355 (1999); Sells et al., \nTrends Cell. Biol. \n7: 162-167 (1997)). PAK proteins were initially identified by their interaction with the active small GTPases, Cdc42, and Rac, and their homology to yeast kinase Ste20 (Manser et al., \nNature \n367: 40-46 (1994)). In addition to mediating the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion by Cdc42 and Rac (Daniels et al., \nTrends Biochem. Sci. \n24: 350-355 (1999)), it was determined that some PAK proteins protect cells from apoptosis (Gnesutta et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276: 14414-14419 (2001); Rudel et al., \nScience \n276: 1571-1574 (1997); Schurmann et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol. \n20: 453-461 (2000)); modulate mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways (Bagrodia et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n270: 27995-27998 (1995); Brown et al., \nCurr. Biol. \n6: 598-605 (1996); Chaudhary et al., \nCurr. Biol. \n10: 551-554 (2000); Frost et al., \nEMBO J. \n16: 6426-6438 (1997); King et al., \nNature \n396: 180-183 (1998); Sun et al., \nCurr. Biol. \n10: 281-284 (2000)); mediate T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling (Yablonski et al., \nEMBO J. \n17: 5647-5657 (1998)); and respond to DNA damage (Roig et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n274: 31119-31122 (1999)). Through these diverse functions, PAK proteins regulate cell proliferation and migration.\n\n\nThe full-length PAK4 nucleic acid and amino acid sequences are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,500 and have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers AF005046 (mRNA) and AAD01210 (amino acid). Modulation of human PAK4 activity is reported to result in alterations in cellular processes affecting cell growth and adhesion. For example, overexpression of PAK4 in fibroblasts leads to morphological changes that are characteristic of oncogenic transformation through induction of anchorage-independent growth and inhibition of apoptosis (Gnesutta et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n276:14414-14419 (2001); Qu et al., \nMol. Cell. Biol. \n21: 3523-2533 (2001)).\n\n\nPAK4 is an attractive target for developing therapeutic agents effective for use in processes and disorders involving cytoskeletal alterations, such as, for example, cancer.\n\n\nFor other background references, see U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0171357 and PCT Publication WO02/12242.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the invention provides a compound of formula I,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein:\n\n\n\nR\n1 \nis chosen from —S(O)R\na\n, —S(O)\n2\nR\na\n, C\n1\n-C\n12 \nalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n12 \nalkyl substituted by 1 to 6 R\n5\n, C\n3\n-C\n12 \ncycloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n12 \ncycloalkyl substituted by 1 to 6 R\n5\n, C\n2\n-C\n12 \nalkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n12 \nalkenyl substituted by 1 to 6 R\n5\n, C\n4\n-C\n12 \ncycloalkenyl, C\n4\n-C\n12 \ncycloalkenyl substituted by 1 to 6 R\n5\n, C\n2\n-C\n12 \nalkynyl, C\n2\n-C\n12 \nalkynyl substituted by 1 to 6 R\n5\n, 3-12 member heterocyclyl, 3-12 member heterocyclyl substituted by 1 to 6 R\n5\n, C\n1\n-C\n6 \naralkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \naralkyl substituted by 1 to 6 R\n5\n, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nheteroaralkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nheteroaralkyl substituted by 1 to 6 R\n5\n, C\n6\n-C\n18 \naryl, C\n6\n-C\n18 \naryl substituted by 1 to 6 R\n5\n, 5-12 member heteroaryl, and 5-12 member heteroaryl substituted by 1 to 6 R\n5\n, wherein any two adjacent R\n5 \ntogether with the atoms to which they are attached may form a fused 4-7 member ring, and the said fused ring is optionally further substituted by 1-3 R\nf\n;\n\n\nR\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare each independently chosen from —H, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nperfluoroalkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl, —(C\n1\n-C\n3 \nalkylene)-(C\n3\n-C\n6 \ncycloalkyl), C\n2\n-C\n6 \nalkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n6 \nalkynyl, C\n1\n-C\n6 \nalkoxy, -(L)\nm\n-halide, -(L)\nm\n—CN, -(L)\nm\n-OH, -(L)\nm\n-NH\n2\n, -(L)\nm\n-(C\n1\n-C\n6 \nmonoalkylamino) and -(L)\nm\n-(C\n2\n-C\n8 \ndialkylamino), provided that R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nare not both H;

In particular, modulating refers to the activation of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs, preferably the activation or inhibition of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs, depending on the concentration of the compound or salt to which the RTK, CTK or STK is exposed or, more preferably, the inhibition of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs.\n\n\n“Catalytic activity” refers to the rate of phosphorylation of tyrosine under the influence, direct or indirect, of RTKs and/or CTKs or the phosphorylation of serine and threonine under the influence, direct or indirect, of STKs.\n\n\n“Contacting” refers to bringing a compound of the present teachings and a target PK together in such a manner that the compound can affect the catalytic activity of the PK, either directly, i.e., by interacting with the kinase itself, or indirectly, i.e., by interacting with another molecule on which the catalytic activity of the kinase is dependent. Such “contacting” can be accomplished “in vitro,” i.e., in a test tube, a petri dish or the like. In a test tube, contacting may involve only a compound and a PK of interest or it may involve whole cells. Cells may also be maintained or grown in cell culture dishes and contacted with a compound in that environment. In this context, the ability of a particular compound to affect a PK related disorder, i.e., the IC\n50 \nof the compound, can be determined before use of compounds in vivo with more complex living organisms is attempted. For cells outside the organism, multiple methods exist, and are well-known to those skilled in the art, to get the PKs in contact with the compounds including, but not limited to, direct cell microinjection and numerous transmembrane carrier techniques.\n\n\n“In vitro” refers to procedures performed in an artificial environment such as, e.g., without limitation, in a test tube or culture medium.\n\n\n“In vivo” refers to procedures performed within a living organism such as, without limitation, a mouse, rat or rabbit.\n\n\n“PK related disorder,” “PK driven disorder,” and “abnormal PK activity” all refer to a condition characterized by inappropriate, i.e., under or, more commonly, over, PK catalytic activity, where the particular PK can be an RTK, a CTK or an STK. Inappropriate catalytic activity can arise as the result of either: (1) PK expression in cells which normally do not express PKs, (2) increased PK expression leading to unwanted cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth, or, (3) decreased PK expression leading to unwanted reductions in cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth. Over-activity of a PK refers to either amplification of the gene encoding a particular PK or production of a level of PK activity which can correlate with a cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth disorder (that is, as the level of the PK increases, the severity of one or more of the symptoms of the cellular disorder increases). Under-activity is, of course, the converse, wherein the severity of one or more symptoms of a cellular disorder increase as the level of the PK activity decreases.\n\n\n“Treat”, “treating” and “treatment” refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a PK mediated cellular disorder and/or its attendant symptoms. With regard particularly to cancer, these terms simply mean that the life expectancy of an individual affected with a cancer will be increased or that one or more of the symptoms of the disease will be reduced.\n\n\n“Organism” refers to any living entity comprised of at least one cell. A living organism can be as simple as, for example, a single eukariotic cell or as complex as a mammal, including a human being.\n\n\n“Therapeutically effective amount” refers to that amount of the compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disorder being treated. In reference to the treatment of cancer, a therapeutically effective amount refers to that amount which has at least one of the following effects:\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) reducing the size of the tumor;\n \n(2) inhibiting (that is, slowing to some extent, preferably stopping) tumor metastasis;\n \n(3) inhibiting to some extent (that is, slowing to some extent, preferably stopping) tumor growth, and\n \n(4) relieving to some extent (or, preferably, eliminating) one or more symptoms associated with the cancer.\n \n \n \n\n\n“Monitoring” means observing or detecting the effect of contacting a compound with a cell expressing a particular PK. The observed or detected effect can be a change in cell phenotype, in the catalytic activity of a PK or a change in the interaction of a PK with a natural binding partner. Techniques for observing or detecting such effects are well-known in the art. The effect is selected from a change or an absence of change in a cell phenotype, a change or absence of change in the catalytic activity of said protein kinase or a change or absence of change in the interaction of said protein kinase with a natural binding partner in a final aspect of this invention.\n\n\n“Cell phenotype” refers to the outward appearance of a cell or tissue or the biological function of the cell or tissue. Examples, without limitation, of a cell phenotype are cell size, cell growth, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell survival, apoptosis, and nutrient uptake and use. Such phenotypic characteristics are measurable by techniques well-known in the art.\n\n\n“Natural binding partner” refers to a polypeptide that binds to a particular PK in a cell. Natural binding partners can play a role in propagating a signal in a PK-mediated signal transduction process. A change in the interaction of the natural binding partner with the PK can manifest itself as an increased or decreased concentration of the PK/natural binding partner complex and, as a result, in an observable change in the ability of the PK to mediate signal transduction.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\nCompounds of formulas I-VII can be made following the synthetic routes in Scheme 1 and Scheme 2.

The amino group of the substituted amino acid I(A) is alkylated to give compound I(B). This can typically be done by treating compound I(A) with an alkylating agent in the presence of a base. An activated electrophilic double bond moiety is a commonly used alkylating reagent. A typical reaction condition of alkylating I(A) with an activated electrophilic double bond moiety is to treat I(A) with the activated double bond moiety in the presence of a strong base. Subsequent aqueous work up affords compound I(B). The amino group of compound I(B) is then protected with a boc group to give compound I(C). This can typically be done by treating compound I(B) with Boc agent in the presence of a base. A typical condition is to treat compound I(B) with (Boc)\n2\nO in the presence of Me\n4\nNOH in MeCN as a solvent. The carboxylic acid group of compound I(C) is then converted into a methyl ester of compound I(D). A typical condition of converting the carboxylic acid group into the methyl ester group is to treat I(C) with methyl iodide in DMF in the presence of a base. Compound I(D) then undergoes an intramolecular aldol condensation to give compound I(F). This can typically be done by treating compound I(D) with a strong base in an aprotic solvent. A typical condition is to treat compound I(D) with t-BuOK in toluene. Subsequent aqueous workup gives compound I(F). Compound I(F) then undergoes a 2+3 cyclization with a hydrazine moiety to form compound I(G). A typical condition of the cyclization is to reflux compound I(F) with hydrazine and acetic acid in EtOH. The free base pyrazole nitrogen of compound I(G) is then acylated to give compound I(H). A typical condition of the acylation is to treat compound I(G) with chloro ethyl carbonate in THF.\n\n\nMore detailed synthetic conditions of Scheme 1 can be found in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0171357 and PCT Publication WO 02/12242, the disclosure of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nScheme 2 illustrates two routes through which compounds of formula I can be made from intermediate I(H). In the first route of Scheme 2, the ethyl ester protecting group of the pyrazole nitrogen of I(H) is cleaved to give compound II(A). This reaction can typically be carried out by treating the substrate I(H) with a base. A typical reaction condition is to reflux the substrate I(H) in dioxane and DCM in the presence of 2-3 equivalents of LiOH followed by aqueous workup. Compound II(A) undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an electrophilic R\n1 \nmoiety to give compound II(B). This nucleophilic reaction can be alkylation, acylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination, and many other reactions that can be carried out for the pyrazole amino group of compound II(A). A typical alkylation condition for the transformation of II(A) to II(B) is to react II(A) with R\n1\n—Cl in the presence of excess base, such as DMA and TEA at an elevated temperature of 80-140° C., and optionally under microwave radiation. Subsequent aqueous workup gives compound II(B). The Boc group on the pyrrole nitrogen of compound II(B) is then removed to give compound II(C). This can typically be done by treating II(B) with a strong acid. A typical condition is to treat compound II(B) with 1:1 TFA:DCM at room temperature for two hours. Subsequent aqueous work up affords compound II(C). Alternatively, the transformation of compound II(A) to compound II(C) can be carried out in a single step. The alkylation of compound II(A) and the removal of the boc protecting group of the pyrrole nitrogen can be carried out in an one pot reaction. A typical reaction condition is to mix substrate II(A) with the alkylating reagent R\n1\n—Cl, excess DMA, one equivalent HCl, in dioxane at an elevated temperature and under microwave radiation. Compound II(C) then undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an R\n4 \nelectrophile to give compound I. The nucleophilic reaction can be alkylation, acylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination and other reactions that a secondary alkyl amine can carry out. An acylation reaction of compound II(C) can be carried out by reacting compound II(C) with an acylating R\n4 \nmoiety. A typical acylation reaction condition is to react II(C) with an isocyanate R\n4 \nmoiety in the presence of TEA at room temperature. Subsequent aqueous workup gives compound I.\n\n\nIn the second route of Scheme 2, the boc group on the pyrrole nitrogen is removed to give compound III(A). The can typically be carried out by treating compound I(H) with a strong acid. A typical reaction condition is to treat compound I(H) with 4N HCl in dioxane and DCM. Subsequent aqueous workup affords compound III(A). Compound III(A) can then undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an R\n4 \nelectrophile give compound III(B). Because the —NH\n2 \ngroup attached to the pyrazole in compound III(A) is less reactive than the pyrrole nitrogen of III(A), the transformation of III(A) to III(B) can be carried out without protecting the pyrazole —NH\n2 \ngroup of compound III(A). The nucleophilic reaction carried out for this transformation can be an alkylation, acylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination. Relative mild reaction conditions are preferred to achieve the reaction selectivity. An acylation reaction of III(A) to give III(B) is carried out by treating compound III(A) with an acylating reagent in the presence of base. A typical reaction condition is to mix compound III(A) with excess of base, such as DIPEA in DCM and adding the resulting solution to an isocyanate at 0° C. The reaction mixture is held at 0° C. for about two hours for the reaction to go complete. Subsequent aqueous workup gives compound III(B). Selective acylation of the pyrrole nitrogen in the presence of the unprotected —NH\n2 \nattached to the pyrazole to obtain compound III(B) can also be done from compound I(H), through the intermediate of III(D). The pyrrole nitrogen of I(H) is deprotected and further acylated to give compound III(D). This can be done by treating compound I(H) with a strong acid, reducing the reaction mixture to a residue and then reacting the residue with an acylating agent. A typical reaction condition is to treat compound I(H) with 4N HCl in dioxane at room temperature for two hours and subsequently remove all solvent. The residue is dissolved and basified by a base such as DIPEA. The resulting solution is then added to triphosgene at 0° C. . The reaction mixture is allowed to stir at 0° C. for an hour. Subsequent aqueous work up affords compound III(D). The crude compound III(D) then reacts with a nucleophile to give compound III(B). A typical reaction condition is to mix compound III(D) with a R\n4 \nnucleophilic amine moiety in the presence of a non-nucleophilic amine in DCM at room temperature. The reaction mixture is be held at room temperature for about two hours. Subsequent aqueous workup afford compound III(B).\n\n\nThe ethyl ester protecting group on the pyrazole nitrogen of compound III(B) is removed to give the free base compound III(C). This can typically be done by treating compound III(B) with a base. A typical reaction condition is to reflux compound III(B) in dioxane and DCM in the presence of 2-3 equivalents of LiOH. Subsequent aqueous workup affords compound III(C). Compound III(C) then undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an R\n1 \nelectrophile moiety. This nucleophilic reaction can be an acylation, alkylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination or one of many other reactions that an amine functionality carries out. A typical alkylation reaction condition is to treating compound III(C) with an alkylating agent such as R\n1\n—Cl, in the presence of a base such as 2 equivalents of DMA, in a solvent such as NMP, the reaction mixture is then heated under microwave radiation to 140° C. for hour hours. Subsequent aqueous workup and purification gives compound of formula I.\n\n\nUnless indicated otherwise, all references herein to the inventive compounds include references to salts, solvates, hydrates and complexes thereof, and to solvates, hydrates and complexes of salts thereof, including polymorphs, stereoisomers, and isotopically labeled versions thereof.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable salts include acid addition and base salts (including disalts).

Such derivatives are referred to as ‘prodrugs’. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in ‘Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T Higuchi and W Stella) and ‘Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design’, Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E B Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\n\n\nProdrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the inventive compounds with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as ‘pro-moieties’ as described, for example, in “Design of Prodrugs” by H Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nSome examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include:\n\n\n(i) where the compound contains a carboxylic acid functionality (—COOH), an ester thereof, for example, replacement of the hydrogen with (C\n1\n-C\n8\n)alkyl;\n\n\n(ii) where the compound contains an alcohol functionality (—OH), an ether thereof, for example, replacement of the hydrogen with (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkanoyloxymethyl; and\n\n\n(iii) where the compound contains a primary or secondary amino functionality (—NH\n2 \nor —NHR where R≠H), an amide thereof, for example, replacement of one or both hydrogens with (C\n1\n-C\n10\n)alkanoyl.\n\n\nFurther examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references.\n\n\nFinally, certain inventive compounds may themselves act as prodrugs of other of the inventive compounds.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound of the invention contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cis/trans (or Z/E) isomers are possible. Where the compound contains, for example, a keto or oxime group or an aromatic moiety, tautomeric isomerism (‘tautomerism’) can occur. A single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.\n\n\nIncluded within the scope of the invention are all stereoisomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the inventive compounds, including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, and mixtures of one or more thereof. Also included are acid addition or base salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, D-lactate or L-lysine, or racemic, for example, DL-tartrate or DL-arginine.\n\n\nCis/trans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallization.\n\n\nConventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\n\nAlternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound contains an acidic or basic moiety, an acid or base such as tartaric acid or 1-phenylethylamine. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to one skilled in the art.\n\n\nChiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% isopropanol, typically from 2 to 20%, and from 0 to 5% of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.\n\n\nStereoisomeric conglomerates may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art; see, for example, “Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds” by E L Eliel (Wiley, New York, 1994), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nThe invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention, wherein one or more atoms is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature.

Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention, for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, \n3\nH, and carbon-14, \n14\nC, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, \n2\nH, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as \n11\nC, \n18\nF, \n15\nO and \n13\nN, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.\n\n\nIsotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D\n2\nO, d\n6\n-acetone, d\n6\n-DMSO.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention intended for pharmaceutical use may be administered as crystalline or amorphous products, or mixtures thereof.

Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques.\n\n\narenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a sterile non-aqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water.\n\n\nThe preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions, for example, by lyophilization, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe solubility of compounds of the invention used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents.\n\n\nFormulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Thus compounds of the invention may be formulated as a solid, semi-solid, or thixotropic liquid for administration as an implanted depot providing modified release of the active compound. Examples of such formulations include drug-coated stents and PGLA microspheres.\n\n\nTopical Administration\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may also be administered topically to the skin or mucosa, that is, dermally or transdermally. Typical formulations for this purpose include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, wafers, implants, sponges, fibers, bandages and microemulsions. Liposomes may also be used. Typical carriers include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Penetration enhancers may be incorporated; see, for example, J Pharm Sci, 88 (10), 955-958 by Finnin and Morgan (October 1999). Other means of topical administration include delivery by electroporation, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, sonophoresis and microneedle or needle-free (e.g. Powderject™, Bioject™, etc.) injection. The disclosures of these references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\n\n\nFormulations for topical administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\nInhaled/Intranasal Administration\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler or as an aerosol spray from a pressurized container, pump, spray, atomizer (preferably an atomizer using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebulizer, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane. For intranasal use, the powder may include a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin.\n\n\nThe pressurized container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebulizer contains a solution or suspension of the compound(s) of the invention comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilizing, or extending release of the active, a propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactic acid.\n\n\nPrior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronized to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns). This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisation, or spray drying.\n\n\nCapsules (made, for example, from gelatin or HPMC), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as I-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.\n\n\nA suitable solution formulation for use in an atomizer using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1 μg to 20 mg of the compound of the invention per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1 μL to 100 μL. A typical formulation includes a compound of the invention, propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.\n\n\nSuitable flavors, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for inhaled/intranasal administration.\n\n\nFormulations for inhaled/intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release using, for example, poly(DL-lactic-coglycolic acid (PGLA). Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\nIn the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve which delivers a metered amount. Units in accordance with the invention are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or “puff” containing a desired mount of the compound of the invention. The overall daily dose may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the day.\n\n\nRectal/Intravaginal Administration\n\n\nCompounds of the invention may be administered rectally or vaginally, for example, in the form of a suppository, pessary, or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, but various alternatives may be used as appropriate.\n\n\nFormulations for rectal/vaginal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\nOcular Administration\n\n\nCompounds of the invention may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronized suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, biodegradable (e.g. absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (e.g. silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis.\n\n\nFormulations for ocular/aural administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted, or programmed release.\n\n\nOther Technologies\n\n\nCompounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.\n\n\nDrug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e.\n\n\nas a carrier, diluent, or solubilizer. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in PCT Publication Nos. WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\n\n\nDosage\n\n\nThe amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is typically in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 0.01 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.07 to about 7000 mg/day, preferably about 0.7 to about 2500 mg/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be used without causing any harmful side effect, with such larger doses typically divided into several smaller doses for administration throughout the day.\n\n\nKit-of-Parts\n\n\nInasmuch as it may desirable to administer a combination of active compounds, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound in accordance with the invention, may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions. Thus the kit of the invention includes two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like.\n\n\nThe kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically includes directions for administration and may be provided with a memory aid.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nIn the following examples and preparations, “BOC”, “Boc” or “boc” means N-tert-butoxycarbonyl, DCM means CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, DIPEA or DIEA means diisopropyl ethyl amine, DMA means N,N-dimethylacetamide, “DMF” means dimethyl formamide, “DMSO” means dimethylsulfoxide, “DPPP” means 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, “HOAc” means acetic acid, “IPA” means isopropyl alcohol. “MTBE” means methyl t-butyl ether, “NMP” means 1-methyl 2-pyrrolidinone, TEA means triethyl amine, TFA means trifluoro acetic acid.\n\n\nSpecific Examples\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n6,6-dimethyl-N-[trans-2-phenylcyclopropyl]-3-(thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-ylamino)-4,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole-5(1H)-carboxamide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation of Compound 1a: N-(6,6-dimethyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazol-3-yl)thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-amine\n\n\nTo a stirring solution of tert-butyl 3-amino-6,6-dimethyl-4,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole-5(1H)-carboxylate (0.62 g, 2.46 mmol) in DMA (3 mL) was added 4-chlorothieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine (0.44 g, 1.05 eq) and 4N HCl solution in 1,4-dioxane (0.65 ml, 1.05 eq).

Method of Example 31 using 4-chloro-2- cyclopropylquinazoline in place of 31c.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiological Testing, Ki Data and Cellular Assay Data\n\n\nCloning, expression, and purification of recombinant PAK4 Kinase domain (PAK4 KD): The cDNA coding for PAK4 was amplified from the EST clone (#12) (purchased from Research Genetics) by using PCR. P33 (ACATATG TCC CATGAGCAGT TCCGGGCTGC CCTGCAGCT, SEQ ID NO: 1) and P34 (CTCA TGGGTGCTTC AGCAGCTCGG CTGCCGTGGC, SEQ ID NO: 2) were used as the 5′ primer and 3′ primer in PCR respectively. The PCR amplified product was cloned into Topo vector (Invitrogen Inc.), and verified by DNA sequencing. PAK4 KD was then subcloned into expression plasmid pET28a(+), pET24a(+), or pGST4.5. The recombinant plasmids containing PAK4 KD was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for recombinant protein expression. The production of PAK4 KD was induced at 27° C. by the addition of IPTG into the cells. The cells were then harvested and lyzed for protein purification. Ni-NTA column (pET28a(+), pET24a(+)) and glutathione column (pGST4.5) were used for the purification. The purified protein was then subjected to thrombin to cleave the N-terminal tags that were inherited from the expression plasmids, and thus gave the PAK4 KD that were used for the Ki assay of this invention.\n\n\nPAK4 kinase domain enzymatic assay conditions: the enzymatic activity of PAK4 KD was measured by its ability to catalyze the transfer of a phosphate residue from a nucleoside triphosphate to an amino acid side chain of a commercially available peptide (amino acid sequence EVPRRKSLVGTPYWM, SEQ ID NO: 3). The conversion of ATP to ADP accompanies the catalytic reaction. The PAK4 KD catalyzed production of ADP from ATP was coupled to the oxidation of NADH through the activities of pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The conversion of NADH to NAD\n+\nis monitored by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (e340 =6.22 cm\n−1\nmM\n−\n) using a Molecular Devices SPECTRAMAX 190 in conjunction with the Biomec FX. Typical reaction solutions contain 2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.35 mM NADH, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM DTT, 0.4mM peptide (EVPRRKSLVGTPYWM, SEQ ID NO: 3) 0.04 mM ATP, 1 units/mL PK, 1 units/mL LDH, 0.01% Tween 20 in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Assays are initiated with the addition of 25nM PAK4 KD. The PAK KD Ki of each compound of the invention (the inhibitor) was calculated based on multiple of Percent Inhibition numbers of the inhibitor at different inhibitor concentrations. The peptide (amino sequence EVPRRKSLVGTPYWM, SEQ ID NO: 3) was purchased from American Peptide Company. NADH, MgCl\n2\n, HEPES, DTT, ATP and PK/LDH were purchased from Sigma. Tween 20 was purchased from Calbiochem.\n\n\nA sandwich ELISA method was used to measure the PAK4 kinase activity in whole cells. The level of PAK4-dependent phosphorylation of GEF-H1b can be determined by monitoring the binding of a phosphospecific antibody to GEF-H1b. A modified HEK 293 cell line is used in the bioassay and it has been engineered to overexpress both GEF-H1b and the kinase domain (KD) of PAK4. The KD of PAK4 is inducible in this cell line by tetracycline (Trex system, Invitrogen). The name of this cell line has been designated TR-293-KDG. To establish a phosphorylation event on GEF-H1, cells are induced with doxycycline to express the PAK4 KD. Negative control wells do not receive induction. Candidate substance effect is measured as the ability to block this phosphorylation event.\n\n\nELISA plate was prepared by pre-coating the plates with a capture antibody (α-HA-tag mouse monoclonal anitibody), blocked with BSA, and washed in 0.1% tween 20 in tris-buffered saline (TBST). Tissue culture plates (precoated with poly-D-lysine) were seeded with TR-293-KDG cells. The TR-293-KDG Cells were induced to express the PAK4 KD with doxycycline overnight and subsequently & concomitantly treated with candidate substances or diluent for an additional 3-hour, continuous exposure. Cells were then lysed with a modified RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. The fresh whole cell lysates were then added to the ELISA plate for 2-hours. Between all subsequent steps plates were washed 4 times with TBST. Detection antibody (recognizing the phospho-specific eptitope on GEF-H1b) was added for 1 hour, followed by addition of an enzyme linked goat a-rabbit secondary antibody for 45 minutes. Color development of the enzyme-linked antibody was performed with a peroxidase substrate, ABTS (Moss, Inc.) with absorbance at 405 nM read with a spectrophotometer after 30 minute incubation. EC50 values were calculated by sigmoid curve fitting using a four-parameter analysis.\n\n\nPAK4 Kinase Domain Ki Data and PAK4 Cellular Assay EC50 Data of the Compounds of Examples 1-86:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEx. #\n\n\nKi data (uM)\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.041\n\n\n>2000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n0.014\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.011\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n0.22\n\n\n87\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n0.0028\n\n\n0.94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n0.087\n\n\n>4000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n0.61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n0.27\n\n\n>4000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.12\n\n\n>4000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n0.96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n0.038\n\n\n78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nN/A\n\n\n>4000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\n0.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n0.090\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n0.076\n\n\n1267\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n0.34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n0.090\n\n\n1199\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n0.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n0.72\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n0.14\n\n\n>4000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n0.64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\n0.78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\n0.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\n0.20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n0.27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n0.66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n0.080\n\n\n968\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n0.020\n\n\n103\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n0.0035\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\n0.047\n\n\n618\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\n0.021\n\n\n778\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n0.26\n\n\n262\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36\n\n\n \n\n\n>4000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\n0.27\n\n\n805\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\n0.096\n\n\n1470\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39\n\n\n \n\n\n>4000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n0.018\n\n\n98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n\n0.024\n\n\n147\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\n0.094\n\n\n610\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n>4000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\n0.23\n\n\n>4000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\n0.0072\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n47\n\n\n0.37\n\n\n401\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n\n0.16\n\n\n332\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\n0.016\n\n\n340\n\n\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n\n0.018\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\n0.0035\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n\n0.067\n\n\n1745\n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\n0.14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n\n \n\n\n>4000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56\n\n\n0.24\n\n\n570\n\n\n\n\n\n\n57\n\n\n0.94\n\n\n\n\n\n\n58\n\n\n0.014\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\n0.17\n\n\n2.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n0.040\n\n\n<3.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\n0.022\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n62\n\n\n0.015\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\n0.02\n\n\n<3.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n64\n\n\n0.003\n\n\n<3.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n65\n\n\n0.68\n\n\n67.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n66\n\n\n0.17\n\n\n<3.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n67\n\n\n0.28\n\n\n20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n68\n\n\n0.0067\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n\n0.0019\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n70\n\n\n0.0088\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n71\n\n\n0.0052\n\n\n\n\n\n\n72\n\n\n0.016\n\n\n4.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n73\n\n\n0.0016\n\n\n<3.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n74\n\n\n0.0036\n\n\n<3.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n75\n\n\n0.0052\n\n\n<3.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n76\n\n\n0.0083\n\n\n<3.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n77\n\n\n0.093\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n78\n\n\n0.33\n\n\n>4000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n79\n\n\n0.039\n\n\n<3.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n80\n\n\n0.12\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n81\n\n\n0.084\n\n\n\n\n\n\n82\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n83\n\n\n0.058\n\n\n84\n\n\n\n\n\n\n84\n\n\n0.034\n\n\n455\n\n\n\n\n\n\n85\n\n\n0.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n86\n\n\n0.055"
