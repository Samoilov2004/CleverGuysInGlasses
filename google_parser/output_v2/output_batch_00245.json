Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to indane-amine derivatives, to processes for the preparation thereof, to medicaments comprising them as well as to their use for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of 5HT7 receptor mediated diseases or conditions.\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by better understanding of the structure of proteins and other biomolecules associated with target diseases. One important class of proteins that has been the subject of extensive study is the family of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT) receptors. The 5-HT7 receptor discovered in 1993 belongs to this family and has attracted great interest as a valuable new drug target (\nTerrón, J.A. Idrugs, 1998, vol. 1, no. 3, pages 302-310: \"The 5HT7 receptor: A target for novel therapeutic avenues? \n\").\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5-HT7 receptors have been cloned from rat, mouse, guinea pig and human cDNA and exhibit a high degree of interspecies homology (approx. 95%), but it is unique in that it has a low sequence homology with other 5-HT receptors (less than 40%). Its expression pattern, in particular structures of the central nervous system (CNS) (highest in hypothalamus, in particular suprachiasmatic nuclei, and thalamus) and other peripheral tissues (spleen, kidney, intestinal, heart and coronary arthery), implicates the 5-HT7 receptor in a variety of functions and pathologies. This idea is reinforced by the fact that several therapeutic agents, such as tricyclic antidepressants, typical and atypical antipsychotics and some 5-HT2 receptor antagonists, display moderate to high affinity for both recombinant and functional 5-HT7 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFunctionally, the 5-HT7 receptor has been implicated in regulation of circadian rhythms in mammals (\nLovenberg, T.W. et al. Neuron, 1993, 11:449-458 \"A novel adenylyl cyclase-activating serotonin receptor (5-HT7) implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms\n\"). It is known that disruption of circadian rhythms is related to a number of CNS disorders including depression, seasonal affective disorder, sleep disorders, shift worker syndrome and jet lag among others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDistribution and early pharmacological data also suggest that the 5-HT7 receptor is involved in the vasodilatation of blood vessels. This has been demonstrated in vivo (\nTerrón, J.A., Br J Pharmacol, 1997, 121:563-571 \"Role of 5-HT7 receptors in the long lasting hypotensive response induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine in the rat\n\"). Thus, selective 5-HT7 receptor agonists have a potential as novel hypertensive agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 5-HT7 receptor has also been related with the pathophysiology of migraine through smooth muscle relaxation of cerebral vessels (\nSchoeffter, P. et al., 1996, Br J Pharmacol, 117:993-994\n ; \nTerrón, J.A., 2002, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 439:1-11 \"Is the 5-HT7 receptor involved in the pathogenesis and prophylactic treatment of migraine?\n \"). In a similar manner, involvement of 5-HT7 in intestinal and colon tissue smooth muscle relaxation makes this receptor a target for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (\nDe Ponti, F. et al. , 2001, Drugs, 61:317-332 \"Irritable bowel syndrome. New agents targeting serotonin receptor subtypes\n \"). Recently, it has also been related to urinary incontinence ( \nBritish J. of Pharmacology, Sept. 2003, 140(1) 53-60: \"Evidence for the involvement of central 5HT-7 receptors in the micurition reflex in anaeshetized female rats\n\").\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the potential therapeutic applications of agonists or antagonists of the 5HT7 receptor, a great effort has been directed to find selective ligands. Despite intense research efforts in this area, very few compounds with selective 5-HT7 antagonist activity have been reported ( \nWesolowska, A., Polish J. Pharmacol., 2002, 54: 327-341, \"In the search for selective ligands of 5-HT5, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 serotonin receptors \n\"), yet even fewer 5-HT7-Agonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome indane-amine derivatives showing activity towards 5HT7 receptors were described in our application \n \nEP2011786\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, there is still a need to find compounds that have pharmacological activity towards the receptor 5-HT7, being both effective and selective, and having good \"drugability\" properties, i.e. good pharmaceutical properties related to administration, distribution, metabolism and excretion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe authors of the present invention hereby provide some novel indane-amine derivatives complying with the above mentioned characteristics.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA first object of the invention refers to compounds of general formula I:\n\n \n \n\nwherein X-Y-Z together form\n\n\n\n        -N-N=CR\n1\n- or =C-NR\n1\n-N= ;\n\n\n\nwherein\n\n \n \n \nR\n1\n is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted aliphatic radical or a phenyl radical, optionally at least mono-substituted by F, Cl, Br, I, SH, OH or O-R with R being an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched and optionally at least mono-substituted by F, Cl, Br, I, SH or OH and which may be bonded by an alkylene group;\n \nR\n2\n and R\n3\n are independently from each other selected from the group consisting of hydrogen; a phenyl radical, optionally at least mono-substituted by F, Cl, Br, I, SH, OH or O-R with R being an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched and optionally at least mono-substituted by F, Cl, Br, I, SH or OH and which may be bonded by an alkylene group; or an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, and optionally at least mono-substituted by F, Cl, Br, I, SH or OH; or O-R with R being an aliphatic radical, which is linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, and optionally at least mono-substituted by F, Cl, Br, I, SH or OH\n \nor R\n2\n and R\n3\n form an saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted 5- or 6-membered-heterocyclic ring, which may be condensed with an optionally at least mono-substituted mono- or polycyclic ring system;\n \nR\n4\n is selected from hydrogen, halogen, OH, SH, NH\n2,\n a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted aliphatic radical or O-R with R being a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted aliphatic radical;\n \nR\n5\n and R\n6\n each are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted aliphatic radical or\n \nR\n5\n and R\n6\n together with the bridging nitrogen atom form a saturated or unsaturated, optionally at least mono-substituted 5- or 6-membered-heterocyclic ring, which may be condensed with an optionally at least monosubstituted mono- or polycyclic ring system;\n \nR\n7\n is a hydrogen\n \n\noptionally in form of one of its stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, its racemate or in form of a mixture of at least two of its stereoisomers, preferably enantiomers or diastereomers, in any mixing ratio, or a salt, preferably a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, or a corresponding solvate, respectively.\n    \n \n \n \nCompounds of general formula I show a high affinity to the 5HT7 receptor as well as a high selectivity for this receptor in comparison to e.g. the 5HT6, the sigma 1, the sigma 2, and the 5HT1 receptor. In addition some of these compounds show an agonistic activity on this receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"mono- or polycyclic ring-system\" according to the present invention means a mono-or polycyclic hydrocarbon ring-system that may be saturated, unsaturated or aromatic. If the ring-system is polycyclic, each of its different rings may show a different degree of saturation, i.e. it may be saturated, unsaturated or aromatic. Optionally each of the rings of the mono- or polycyclic ring-system may contain one or more heteroatoms as ring members, which may be identical or different and which can preferably be selected from the group consisting of N, O, S and P, more preferably be selected from the group consisting of N, O and S. Preferably the polycyclic ring-system may comprise two rings that are condensed. The rings of the mono- or polycyclic ring-system are preferably 5- or 6-membered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn \"aryl\", \"aryl radical\" or group is understood as meaning ring-systems with at least one aromatic ring but without heteroatoms even in only one of the rings. Examples are phenyl, naphthyl, fluoranthenyl, fluorenyl, tetralinyl or indanyl, in particular 9H-fluorenyl or anthracenyl radicals, which can be unsubstituted or monosubstituted or polysubstituted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the context of this invention \"cycloalkyl radical\" or group is understood as meaning saturated and unsaturated (but not aromatic) cyclic hydrocarbons (without a heteroatom in the ring), which can be unsubstituted or mono- or polysubstituted.

However, mono- or polyunsaturated, preferably monounsaturated, cycloalkyls also in particular fall under the term cycloalkyl as long as the cycloalkyl is not an aromatic system. The cycloalkyl radicals are preferably cyclopropyl, 2-methylcyclopropyl, cyclopropylmethyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopentylmethyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, and also adamantly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA \"heterocyclyl\", a \"heterocyclyl radical\" or group or \"heterocyclic ring-system\" is understood as meaning heterocyclic ring-systems which contain one or more heteroatoms from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and/or sulfur in the ring or ring-system, and can also be mono- or polysubstituted. The ring-system may consist either of only one saturated or unsaturated or even aromatic ring or may consist of 2, 3 or 4 saturated or unsaturated or even aromatic rings, which are condensed in that between two or more of the rings ring members are shared. Examples which may be mentioned from the group of heterocyclyls are furan, benzofuran, thiophene, benzothiophene, pyrrole, pyridine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, quinoline, isoquinoline, phthalazine, benzo-1,2,5-thiadiazole, imidazo-thiazole, benzothiazole, indole, benzotriazole, benzodioxolane, benzodioxane, carbazole and quinazoline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with mono- or polycyclic ring-system, aryl radical, cycloalkyl radical, or heterocyclyl radical, \"substituted\" is understood - unless defined otherwise - as meaning replacement of at least one hydrogen radical on the ring-system of the mono-or polycyclic ring-system, the aryl radical, the cycloalkyl radical, or the heterocyclyl radical by OH, SH, =O, halogen (F, Cl, Br, I), CN, NO\n2\n, COOH; NRxRy, with Rx and Ry independently being either H or a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted C1-6-alkyl; by a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted C1-6-alkyl; a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted -O-C1-6-alkyl (alkoxy); a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted -S-C1-6alkyl; a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted - C(O)-C1-6-alkyl; a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted -C(O)-O-C1-6-alkyl; a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl. Within that \"monosubstituted\" means the substitution of exactly one hydrogen radical, whereas \"polysubstituted\" means the substitution of more than one hydrogen radical with \"polysubstituted\"radicals being understood as meaning that the replacement takes effect both on different and on the same atoms several times with the same or different substituents. Therefore, \"optionally at least monsubstituted\" means either \"not substituted\" if the option is not fulfilled, \"monosubstituted\" or \"polysubstituted\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with aryl radical, cycloalkyl radical, or heterocyclyl radical, \"condensed with\" is understood as meaning that the ring-system of the aryl radical, the cycloalkyl radical, or the heterocyclyl radical is sharing two atoms (one) of its ring(s) with a ring of the mono- or polycyclic ring-system it is condensed with.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAliphatic radicals/groups, as referred to in the present invention, are optionally mono-or polysubstituted and may be branched or linear, saturated or unsaturated.

Specifically, two different processes for preparing compounds of formula I are herein described referred as processes A and B.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPROCESS A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nProcess A corresponds to a process for preparing compounds of formula I in the particular case that X-Y-Z is -N-N=CR\n1\n, that is, a process for preparing compounds of general formula (Ia) comprising:\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \na) reacting a compound of general formula (II):\n\n \n \n\nwith a compound of general formula III:\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn the Ullmann reaction between compound (II) and (III) M represents a halogen atom, preferably a bromide, and R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, R\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n6\n and R\n7\n have the same meaning as in claim 1 or 2. The reaction is carried out in a suitable reaction medium and preferably in the presence of a copper catalyst, a suitable ligand and at least one base. This process can be performed by subjecting the reaction mixture to reflux by conventional heating for a period of time sufficient to achieve the title compound (Ia), or by microwave radiation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable reaction media are e.g. organic solvents, such as ethers, preferably diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofurane, dimethyl glycol ether, or alcohols, e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol, or hydrocarbons, preferably benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cyclohexane, petroleum ether, or halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. dichloromethane, trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, dichloroethylene, trichloroethylene, chlorobenzene or/and other solvents preferably ethyl acetate, triethylamine, pyridine, dimethulsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoramide, acetonitrile, acetone or nitromethane are included. Mixtures based one or more of the above mentioned solvents and water may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the invention, the bases that may be used in the process are generally organic or inorganic bases, preferably alkali metal hydroxides, e.g. sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or obtained from other metals such as barium hydroxide or different carbonates, preferably potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate or alkoxydes, e.g. sodium methoxide potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide or potassium tert-butoxide, or organic amines, preferably triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine or heterocycles, e.g. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1,8-diazabicyclo5.4.0]undec-7-ene, pyridine, diamino pyridine, dimethylaminopyridine, methylpiperidine or morpholine. Alkali metals such as sodium or its hydrides, e.g. sodium hydride, may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLigand-free conditions are known for Ullmann coupling, but the reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a suitable ligand such as mono- or bidentate ligands, such as phosphines, salicylamides, diamines, diols, amino alcohols, amino acids, phosphoramidites, oximephosphine, oxides, or phosphinidenes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparation of compounds of general formula (III) can be achieved by nucleophilic substitution with amines of general formula (IV),\n\n\n\n        HNR\n5\nR\n6\n    \n(IV)\n \n\n\n\nwherein R\n5\n and R\n6\n have the meaning given above, of the corresponding mesilate of compounds of general formula (V),\n\n \n \n\nwherein R\n4\n and R\n7\n have the meaning given above and X represents halogen, preferably bromide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDihydroindenols of general formula (V) can be synthesized by treatment of compounds of general formula (VI) with a reducing agent in a suitable reaction media,\n\n \n \n\nwherein R\n4\n and R\n7\n have the meaning given above and M represents halogen, preferably bromide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of general formula (VI) can directly afford compounds of general formula (III) through a reductive amination with secondary amines of general formula (IV). The reductive amination is performed by reaction of a mixture comprising a compound of general formula (VI), and amino compound of general formula (IV) and a reducing agent in a suitable reaction medium, for a period of time sufficient to achieve the title compound (III). The reductive amination reaction can also be performed under microwave radiation. The use of microwave irradiation limits the formation of undesirable secondary reaction products, compared to what is obtained in a conventional reductive amination procedure. This process can be performed as a direct reaction when the carbonyl compound of general formula (VI) and the amine compound of general formula (IV) are mixed with the reducing agent without prior formation of the intermediate imine or iminium salt. A stepwise or indirect reaction involves the reduction of the preformatted imine in a separate step.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe choice of the reducing agent for reductive amination reaction can be conventionally made by those skilled in the art. Reducing agents useful in this procedure include hydrogen and a catalyst, zinc and HCl, sodium cyanoborohydride, lithium cyanoborohydride, tetrabutylammonium cyanoborohydride, cyanoborohydride on a solid support, sodium cyanoborohydride and dehydrating agents, sodium cyanoborohydride and titanium additives, sodium cyanoborohydride and zinc halide additives, sodium borohydride, sodium borohydride and dehydrating agents, sodium borohydride and titanium additives, sodium borohydride and zinc salt additives, lithium borohydride, potassium borohydride, polymer-supported borohydride, borohydride exchange resin with nickel acetate or palladium acetate, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride and additives, tetramethylammonium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium cyano-9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, lithium triethylborohydride, lithium tri(sec-butyl)borohydride, sodium diisopinocampheylcyanoborohydride, amine boranes, borane-pyridine complex and alkylamine boranes. Sodium triacetoxyborohydride is particularly preferred because is non-toxic and generally does not reduce the carbonyl group prior to imine formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable reaction media are the same as specified before.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of general formulas (II), (IV) and (VI) are either commercially available or can be produced according to methods known to those skilled in the art.

The protocol assay was essentially the recommended protocol in the Technical Data Sheet by PerkinEmer Life and Analytical Sciences. The Mass membrane protein/well was typically 12 g and the Receptor/well was about 9-10 fmoles. The Flashplate were let equilibrate at room temperature for one hour before the addition of the components of the assay mixture. The binding buffer was: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.5% BSA. The radioligand was [\n125\nI]LSD at a final concentration of 0.82 nM. Nonspecific binding was determined with 50 M of Clozapine. The assay volume was 25 I. TopSeal-A were applied onto Flashplate microplates and they were incubated at room temperature for 240 minutes in darkness. The radioactivity were quantified by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry (Wallac 1450 Microbeta Trilux) with a count delay of 4 minutes prior to counting and a counting time of 30 seconds per well. Competition binding data were analyzed by using the LIGAND program (\nMunson and Rodbard, LIGAND: A versatile, computerized approach for characterization of ligandbinding systems. Anal. Biochem. 107: 220-239, 1980\n ) and assays were performed in triplicate determinations for each point.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults of the radioligand assay for representative compounds/examples are given in the table below:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nExample\n \n \n \nStructure\n \n \n \n5-HT\n7\n Ki (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n425.2\n \n \n \n9\n \n \n \n \n \n \n360.3\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nFORMULATION EXAMPLE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample of a tablet formulation:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompound according to example 3: 5 mg,\n\nLactose:_ 60 mg\n\nCrystalline cellulose: 25 mg\n\nPovidone K 90: 5 mg\n\nPregelanitized starch: 3 mg\n\nColloidal silica dioxide: 1 mg\n\nMagnesium stearate: 1 mg\n\nTotal weight per tablet: 100 mg\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above mentioned ingredients were mixed and compressed into a tablet by conventional methods known to those skilled in the art."
