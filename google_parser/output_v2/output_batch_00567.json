Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/056,949, filed on May 29, 2008, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nSeveral lines of pharmacological and genetic evidence support the role of melanin concentrating hormone receptor-1 (hereafter “MCHR1”) as a modulator of food intake and body weight. Central administration of melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) increases food intake and body weight in both rats and mice. Chronic ICV infusion of MCH causes increased food intake and ultimately obesity in mice, while infusion of an MCH peptide antagonist blocks MCH-induced food intake and results in weight loss and decreased feeding in diet-induced obese mice.\n\n\nThe expression of both the MCH peptide and receptor are modulated by nutritional status. MCH mRNA is upregulated both in hyperphagic obese mice (ob/ob), and fasted animals. Targeted disruption of the gene for MCH peptide results in hypophagia and leanness. Disruption of the MCHR1 gene causes leanness, altered metabolism, and hyperlocomotion accompanied by mild hyperphagia. Conversely, over-expression of MCH peptide results in hyperphagia, obesity and diabetes. Small molecule MCHR1 antagonists have been shown to cause weight loss in rodent weight and feeding models after both oral and intraperitoneal administration; \nEur. J; Pharmacol, \n438:129-135 (2002); \nNat. Med., \n8:825-830 (2002); \nEur. J. Pharmacol, \n497; 41-47 (2004).\n\n\nMCHR1 has also been reported to play a key role in the pathogenesis of acute experimental colitis and possibly human IBD (inflammatory bowel disease). It has been shown that immunoneutralization is an effective treatment for TNBS-induced colitis. Kokkotou, E. et al., “Melanin-concentrating hormone as a mediator of intestinal inflammation”, \nPNAS, \n105(30):10613-10618 (Jul. 29, 2008).\n\n\nIn addition, MCH and MCHR1 has also been reported to play a role in the endocrine and behavioral responses to stress. Treatment of rats and mice with MCHR antagonists produce a robust anti-depressant and anti-anxiolytic effect. (JPET DOI:10.1124/jpet.108.143362)\n\n\nNumerous non-peptide MCHR1 antagonists have been disclosed. The scope of the genus for each reflects a common perception regarding the criteria required for ligand recognition as MCHR1 agonists. A recent review of MCHR1 patent disclosures emphasized the commonality of these structures by the following description; “Ubiquitous throughout the MCH patent literature are molecules consisting of a central scaffold to which linkers to an aryl or heteroaryl group and a basic amino functionality are attached” (T. J. Kowalski, T. J. et al., \nExp. Opin. Invest. Drugs, \n13:1113-1122 (2004)). Pharmacophore models of these geni consistently envision a presumed prerequisite electrostatic interaction between a basic amine center of the antagonist ligand and aspartic acid 123 of the receptor which presumably is envisaged to emulate the mandatory interaction between arginine 14 of MCH peptide agonists with aspartic acid 123 of the MCHR1 receptor. (Ulven, T. et al., \nJ. Med. Chem., \n48:5684-5697 (2005)). However, incorporation of this basic amine in a MCHR1 antagonist increases substantially the probability of binding to off-target ion-channels and biogenic amine receptors.\n\n\nU.S. Patent Publication No. 2007/0093509 A1 published Apr. 26, 2007 discloses a series of novel high affinity selective MCHR1 antagonists of formula A:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein,\n\n\n\nA is phenyl or a monocyclic heteroaryl;\n\n\nD is CH\n2 \nor a direct bond;\n\n\nR\n1 \nis independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower cycloalkyl, CF\n3\n, OR\n6 \nor SR\n6\n;\n\n\nR\n2 \nis hydrogen or lower alkyl;\n\n\nR\n4 \nis hydroxyl or G-D\n2\n-Z\nn\n;\n\n\nn is an integer from 1 to 3;\n\n\nR\n5 \nis hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl, lower cycloalkyl, CF\n3\n, SR\n6\n, lower alkoxy, lower cycloalkoxy, CN, CONR\n7\nR\n7\n, SOR\n6\n, SO\n2\nR\n6\n, NR\n7\nCOR\n7\n, NR\n7\nCO\n2\nR\n7\n, CO\n2\nR\n6\n, heteroaryl, NR\n7\nSO\n2\nR\n6 \nor COR\n6\n;\n\n\nG is O, S or CR\n7\nR\n7\n;\n\n\nD\n2 \nis a direct bond, lower alkyl, lower cycloalkyl or a 4 to 6-membered non-basic heterocycle;\n\n\nZ is hydrogen, hydroxyl, lower alkoxy, lower cycloalkoxy, OCONR\n7\nR\n7\n, CN, CONR\n7\nR\n7\n, SOR\n6\n, SO\n2\nR\n6\n, NR\n7\nCOR\n7\n, NR\n7\nCO\n2\nR\n7\n, CO\n2\nR\n6\n, heteroaryl, NR\n6\nSO\n2\nR\n6 \nor COR\n6\n;\n\n\nR\n6 \nis independently selected from lower alkyl or lower cycloalkyl; and\n\n\nR\n7 \nis independently selected from hydrogen, lower alkyl or lower cycloalkyl, wherein two R\n7 \nand the atom to which they are attached may optionally form a ring of 4 to 7 atoms.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is directed to MCHR1 antagonists having surprisingly superior pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, such as those having the following formula IA or IB, including all stereoisomers thereof:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nor prodrugs or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

Decolorization occurred as the resulting dark orange solution was stirred at <10° C. for 50 min. After removal of the ice bath, the mixture was stirred at 20° C. for another 0.5 h; whereupon, 30 ml of water was added. After stirring an additional 15 min, the reaction was diluted with 90 ml water prior to extraction with 200 mL of Et\n2\nO (4×). The combined organic layers were sequentially washed with 1M Na\n2\nCO\n3 \n(150 ml) and brine (100 ml) before drying over any. MgSO\n4\n. After filtration and concentration using a rotary evaporator, the crude product was obtained as colorless oil.

LC-MS analysis revealed the conversion to product was complete. The resulting yellow reaction mixture was diluted with water (932 ml) and stirred for 4 hr as the mixture cooled to 20° C. Subsequent filtration yielded a yellow filter cake which after washing 3× with 150 mL of H\n2\nO and air drying yielded 34.6 g of 1-cyclopropyl-2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenoxy)ethanone as a light yellow solid.

Preparation (1)\n\n\nTo a yellow suspension of 1-cyclopropyl-2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenoxy)ethanone (34.6 g, 138 mmol), prepared in Part B, in EtOH (356 mL) at 0° C. was added NaBH\n4 \n(3.1 g, 82 mmol) over 15 min. After removal of the ice bath, the temperature was not allowed to exceed 20° C. while the reaction stirred for 35 additional min. During this period the color progressively became a deeper yellow hue. The stirred reaction was cooled to ˜10° C. using an ice bath prior to cautious slow addition of HOAc (12 mL, 210 mmol) to minimize the rate of evolution of H\n2 \ngas. After stirring for 0.5 h following cessation of gas evolution, the yellow suspension was concentrated under vacuum using a rotary evaporator to remove ˜300 mL of EtOH. Filtration yielded a light yellow solid (28.7 g) after washing with H\n2\nO and air drying. Subsequent further concentration of the filtrate to remove most of the EtOH resulted in more precipitate forming which, after filtration as described previously, corresponded to an additional 4.9 g of desired product. The two fractions were combined to yield 33.6 g of racemic 1-cyclopropyl-2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenoxy)ethanol.\n\n\nRacemic 1-cyclopropyl-2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenoxy)ethanol (45.1 g, mmol) in 2/1 MeCN/1-PrOH (451 mL) was resolved by chiral chromatography resolution using a CHIRALPAK® AD-H (3×25 cm, 5 μm) column under the Chiral-SFC conditions. The chromatographic conditions employed an 85/15 mixture of CO\n2\n/i-PrOH as the mobile solvent with a flow rate of 130 mL/min at 35° C. with the BPR pressure maintained at 100 bar and detector wavelength at 234 nM. Each 0.7 mL injection required a run time of 7 min. The chiral purity of the R enantiomer was determined to be greater than 99.9% at 234 nm based on SFC/UV area % using analytical SFC conditions. Concentration of the resultant eluant under vacuum using a rotary evaporator yielded (R)-1-cyclopropyl-2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenoxy)ethanol as yellow oil. Subsequent dissolution in 150 ml EtOH and reconcentration yielded the title compound in the form of a yellow oil which solidified to form a light yellow solid (20.9 g) upon drying under high vacuum overnight.

To the resulting thick white suspension was added bis(2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl) diisopropylphosphoramidite (9.8 g; 26.80 mmoles), prepared in Part A. The stirred reaction was heated to reflux (40° C. internal) for 18 hr under N\n2\n. After 18.25 hrs (HPLC showed clean conversion after 17.5 hrs), the reaction mixture was cooled to −3 to −4° C. Subsequent dropwise addition of H\n2\nO\n2 \n(8.8 mL; 100.14 mmoles) resulted in a high exotherm which subsided only if the addition was stopped. Note the exotherm only occurred during addition of the first 1.3-1.5 mL; addition of the remaining H\n2\nO\n2 \nover 15 minutes was not exothermic at all. Upon completion of the addition, the reaction was stirred for 2 hrs at 0-5° C. whereupon HPLC analysis revealed the reaction to be complete and fairly clean (˜92.9-93 AP). The reaction was quenched by dropwise addition of cold 60 mL of 1N aqueous Na\n2\nS\n2\nO\n5 \nover 12-15 minutes. Note a cooling bath is required as the first 15-20 mL of the quench produced an exotherm resulting in the temperature rising to 17-18° C.; the rest of the addition was endothermic. The mixture was stirred for 20 minutes at 10-15° C. prior to separating the phases. (No peroxides were detected in the organic layer.) The organic layer was washed sequentially with 70 mL of 1N HCl, 65 mL of H\n2\nO and 50 mL of brine prior to drying over 4.5 g of MgSO\n4\n. After removal of the desiccant by filtration, the volume was reduced to approximately 30 mL using a rotary evaporator at 25 Torr and bath below 30° C. The residue was redissolved in 65 mL of MTBE; reconcentration to ˜30-35 mL produced a slightly hazy residue. Dilution with an additional 35 mL of MTBE and 45 mL of hexanes in 15 mL portions generated a solid. Swirling enhanced formation of white translucent particles during concentration to 40 mL. Further concentration of the residue to dryness yielded 24.5 g of a white solid contaminated with MTBE. Titration of the solid in 40 mL of hexanes produced a seemingly fairly homogeneous suspension which after further dilution with 40 mL hexanes+5 mL of MTBE was collected by filtration.

After 64 min, the composition was 0.0% starting ester, 0.62% monodeprotection, 94.36% desired product, 1.52% (R)-6-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(4-(2-cyclopropyl-2-hydroxyethoxy)-3-methoxyphenyl)-thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one and 2.69% of main side-product. After 95 minutes, the reaction was cooled to ˜3° C. prior to the addition of MeOH (28.5 mL) over 5 min. After stirring for 30 min, the reaction was concentrated at 50 mm Hg and 15° C. to a residual volume of ˜134 mL. The solution temperature was increased to 19° C. prior to slow addition of 120 mL of MTBE (ca 12 min). Although seeding was begun after addition of ˜30 mL, about 42-45 mL of MTBE was added before a white precipitate started to form. After stirring for 2 hours at 19-20° C., the solid was collected by filtration. Both the reactor and the filter cake were washed twice with 120 mL of MTBE/CH\n2\nCl\n2 \n2.5:1 v/v. The very sandy white/off-white material was air-dried for 15 min with vacuum suction before drying overnight in a vacuum oven at 45° C. to obtain 25.58 g of crude product. This material, which contained some TFA by F NMR, was recrystallized by heating 24.3 g of the crude product in 200 mL of THF and 16 mL of water in a CHEMGLASS® jacketed reactor with stirring to 55-57° C. to achieve complete dissolution. The solution was heated at 60° C. for an additional 15 min, cooled to 45° C. over 10 min; whereupon 50 mL of acetone was added over Ca 5 min while maintaining the temperature above 44° C. throughout the addition. Upon completion of addition the faintly cloudy solution was seeded with previously crystallized product. Once rapid crystallization began, an additional 245 mL of acetone over 30 minutes was added maintaining the temperature above 42.5° C. throughout the addition, The resultant thick slurry was cooled to 22° C. (jacket) over ca 60 minutes and stirred for 90 min at 20-21° C. before collecting the solid by filtration. Both the reactor and the filter cake were washed first with 120 mL of acetone/THF 3:1 v/v and then with acetone (110 mL). After air drying for 40 min with vacuum suction, the solid was dried in a vacuum oven at 50° C. for 18 hr to yield 18.96 g of (R)-2-(4-(6-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-oxothieno[3,2-d]pyrimidin-3(4H)-yl)-2-methoxyphenyloxy)-1-cyclopropylethyl dihydrogen phosphate (99.2% ee, 99.4% purity in 73% yield).

Binding experiments were carried out with 0.5-1.0 ug of membrane protein incubated in a total of 0.2 ml in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) with 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, and 0.1% BSA (Binding Buffer) for 90 min. For competition binding assays, reactions were carried out in the presence of with 0.06-0.1 nM [Phe\n13\n, [\n125\nI]Tyr\n19\n]-MCH and increasing concentrations of unlabeled test molecules. Reactions were terminated by rapid vacuum filtration over 96 well-GFC Unifilter plates pre-coated with 0.075 ml binding buffer containing 1% BSA, and washed 3 times with 0.4 ml of Phospho-buffered Saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.01% TX-100, Filters were dried, 0.05 ml MicroScint 20 was added to each well and radioactivity was subsequently quantified by scintillation counting on a TOPCOUNT® microplate scintillation counter (Packard). Inhibitory constants were determined by nonlinear least squares analysis using a four parameter logistic equation.\n\n\nCompounds exhibiting Ki values of 20 mM or less were selected for further characterization for metabolic stability versus rat microsomal oxidative degradation mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Compounds exhibiting less than 10% degradation were further evaluated in a rat PK model to assess oral bioavailability and ability to access the CNS. For the compounds of the present invention IA and IB and a to f, solubility limited absorption severely curtailed oral exposure unless the compounds (IA and IB and a to f) were administered as a pro-drug which for this evaluation was an amino acid ester, namely valine and glycine, respectively. The L-valine ester prodrug was employed for the comparative in vivo studies with the subset containing IA, c, d and e; the glycine ester prodrug was utilized for the subset containing IS, a, b and f. After oral administration of a 10 mg/kg dose of the pro-drug ester to rats, criteria for further evaluation were a brain to plasma ratio of 0.2 to 3 and an 8 hr AUC greater than 3 micromole*hr of the bio-active substance. The subset of compounds meeting this criteria were subsequently evaluated in a four day efficacy model entailing daily administration of the ester pro-drug to young growing male rats. Compounds producing dose dependent weight loss which exceeded 5% weight loss when administered at 30 mg/kg or less were further characterized using hepatocytes obtained from rat, dog, primate and humans to determine relative clearance rates as well as to ascertain which species would best predict the human clearance. After the dog was established as being most predictive for human PK, the half-life in dog was utilized to project the clinical half-life of the active compounds.\n\n\nCompounds Tested\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the similarity in structure to compounds IA and IB (the compounds of the invention), compounds a to f, illustrated above, failed to meet all of the criteria.\n\n\nOnly compounds IA and IB of the invention met the selection criteria for each of these assays. For compound f hepatocyte clearance was very slow for both dog and human. Subsequent full PK study in dog revealed the half-life in dogs to exceed 200 hr. Given that the human half-life was projected to be equally long if not longer, progression of compound f was deemed to be undesirable since compounds with half-lives exceeding a week greatly complicate and increase expense as well as raise safety concerns during clinical studies.\n\n\nMoreover, subsequent studies with rats administered compound f at 30 mg/kg for a month revealed that the animals developed obstructive hepatic biliary lesions. Further investigation established that the toxic agent was a metabolite arising from in vivo oxidative hydroxylation of the alkyl chain containing the tertiary carbinol moiety of compound f. When administered to rats for a month at doses up to 300 mg/kg, neither compound IA nor compound IB induced biliary lesion formation since a comparable metabolic transformation cannot occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEfficacy at 30 mg/kg\n\n\n \n\n\nPredicted\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nHuman\n\n\nRat Microsomal\n\n\n \n\n\nRat PK AUC\n\n\n(weight loss in\n\n\nDog Half-\n\n\nHuman\n\n\nFormation of\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\nStability\n\n\nBrain:Plasma\n\n\n(10 mg/kg)\n\n\nyoung growing rats)\n\n\nlife (hr)\n\n\nHalf-life\n\n\nBiliary Lesions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIA\n\n\n10\n\n\n92%\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n24.5\n\n\n6.4%\n\n\n32 hr\n\n\n35\n\n\nhr\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIB\n\n\n18\n\n\n95%\n\n\n2.5\n\n\n38\n\n\n7.9%\n\n\n16 hr\n\n\n18-30\n\n\nhr\n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\n10\n\n\n20%\n\n\n \n\n\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb\n\n\n9\n\n\n40%\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n35\n\n\n0\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc\n\n\n12\n\n\n60%\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n14.5\n\n\n4.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nd\n\n\n11\n\n\n100%\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n20\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne\n\n\n8\n\n\n100%\n\n\n0.09\n\n\n46\n\n\n4.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\nf\n\n\n12\n\n\n98%\n\n\n2\n\n\n45\n\n\n8.2\n\n\n>200 hr \n\n\n>200\n\n\nhr\n\n\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds IA and IB also exhibited human hepatocyte clearance rates that approximated that of dog; however, the half-life in dogs was under 20 hr. As a consequence the projected human half-life for these two compounds was predicted to be 20 to 40 hr. Accordingly, compounds IA and IB exhibit surprisingly superior pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and safety profiles.\n\n\nEvaluation of Prodrugs\n\n\nThe relative ability of the prodrug to enhance exposure (bioavailability) was assessed in an eight hour PK study using cannulated SPRAGUE DAWLEY® (CD, Charles River Breeding Laboratory) rats.

The room was maintained at 72° F. and 50% humidity, and a 12/12 light dark cycle with lights out at 1600 hours. The rats were conditioned for 5 days prior to the start of the study to having a choice of foods. A normal chow (HARLAN TEKLAD®, 2018) that contains 18% protein, 5% fat and 73% carbohydrate and a high fat high sugar diet (Research Diets (D2327)) that contains 20% protein, 40% fat and 40% carbohydrate where the carbohydrate is entirely sucrose and the fat is soybean and coconut oil. Studies have revealed that rats exhibit a high preference for the high fat coconut oil. Studies have revealed that rats exhibit a high preference for the high fat/high sucrose dies (80% preference). Body weight and consumption of both kinds of food as well as water intake were measured daily. Water was available ad lib throughout the study. Food consumption is presented as daily caloric consumption which is the sum of grams of chow multiplied by the Kcal per gram (3.5) plus grams of high fat high sugar multiplied by Kcal per gram (4.59).\n\n\nBaseline body weight was measured prior to drug treatment on day 0 of the study. Baseline food consumption was the average of the 3 days prior to the first drug treatment. Drug was administered daily p.o. at 2.0 ml/kg at 1500 hours beginning on day 0 and continuing daily through day 4 as a suspension in 0.5% methyl cellulose, 0.1% Tween 80 in water at 3.0, 10 and 30 mg/kg p.o.

The animal room was maintained at 72 degrees F. and 50% humidity. The rats were made obese by giving them simultaneous access to two different diets, HARLAN TEKLAD® rat chow (standard chow) and Research Diets D12327 (a high fat, high carbohydrate, highly palatable diet). The Research Diets chow is comprised of 40% vegetable fat, 40% carbohydrate (sucrose) and 20% protein. The Harlan diet is comprised of 5% fat (soybean oil), 67% carbohydrate (starch) and 22% protein. The normal Harlan rat diet used contains 3.4 kcal/gram of diet, and Research Diet #12327 contains 4.59 kcal/gram. The rats were on the choice diet regime for 10 weeks in order to induce obesity. Once started on the choice diet regime the rats are maintained on it for the duration of the study. Baseline feeding and body weight were collected and used to sort animals into treatment groups. Mean rat weight at the start of the choice diet was 250 grams. The mean weight of the rats at the start of chronic dosing was 661.7±6.3 (mean±sem) grams.\n\n\nRats were dosed orally one hour before the start of the dark cycle. Body weight and food consumption were measured daily at the time of dosing. Food consumption was converted to Kcal consumed. Total Kcal consumed was determined by adding the Kcal consumed for each diet and this was determined by multiplying grams of each diet consumed times the Kcal/gram.\n\n\nLocomotor activity of the animals was determined on day 2 of the study using an Opto-M3 system from Columbus Instruments, Columbus, Ohio. This measurement was performed immediately after indirect calorimetry assessments on day 2. Activity was monitored in the evening beginning at 3 pm and continued for 16 hours. Photobeam breaks over time were collapsed into 60 minute bins.\n\n\nRespiratory quotient (RQ) and oxygen consumption (vO\n2\n) were measured by indirect calorimetry using an Oxymax system from Columbus Instruments, Columbus, Ohio. Measurements were made on days 2 and 15 of the study. Rats were dosed and placed in individual chambers. Six measurements for each animal were made with 45 minutes between measurements. Measurements were started at 10:00 AM, with the onset of the dark cycle at 1 PM. Data was normalized to body surface area (kg\n0.75\n).

Field of the Invention\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention relates to binding proteins that bind to insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-II) with cross-reactivity to insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) and uses of such binding proteins. More specifically, the invention relates to monoclonal antibodies directed to IGF-II with cross-reactivity to IGF-I and uses of these antibodies. Aspects of the invention also relate to hybridomas or other cell lines expressing such antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Description of the Related Art\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsulin-like growth factor IGF-I and IGF-II are small polypeptides involved in regulating cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and transformation. IGFs exert their various actions by primarily interacting with a specific cell surface receptor, the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and activating various intracellular signaling cascades. IGFs circulate in serum mostly bound to IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1 to 6). The interaction of IGFs with the IGF-IR is regulated by the IGFBPs, and IGFs can only bind to the IGF-IR once released from the IGFBPs (mostly by proteolysis of the IGFBPs). IGF-I can also bind to a hybrid receptor comprised of IGF-IR and insulin receptor (IR) subunits. IGF-II has been shown to bind to the “A” isoform of the insulin receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMalignant transformation involves the imbalance of diverse processes such as cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and transformation. IGF-I and IGF-II have been implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide range of conditions, and are thought to play a role in tumorigenesis due to the mitogenic and antiapoptotic properties mediated by the receptor IGF-IR. LeRoith and Roberts, \nCancer Lett. \n195:127-137 (2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIGF-I was discovered as a growth factor produced by the liver under the regulatory control of pituitary growth hormone and was originally designated somatomedin-C. Salmon et al., \nJ. Lab. Clin. Med. \n49:825-826 (1957). Both IGF-I and IGF-II are expressed ubiquitously and act as endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine growth factors, through their interaction with the IGF-IR, a trans-membrane tyrosine kinase that is structurally and functionally related to the insulin receptor (IR). IGF-I functions primarily by activating the IGF-IR, whereas IGF-II can act through either the IGF-IR or through the IR-A isoform. LeRoith and Roberts, Cancer Lett. 195:127-137 (2003). Additionally, the interaction of both IGF-I and IGF-II with the IGF-binding proteins may affect the half-life and bioavailability of the IGFs, as well as their direct interaction with receptors in some cases. Rajaram et al., \nEndocr. Rev. \n18:801-831 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIGF-I has a long-term impact on cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Experiments in cultured osteosarcoma and breast cancer cells suggested that IGF-I is a potent mitogen and exerts its mitogenic action by increasing DNA synthesis and by stimulating the expression of cyclin D1, which accelerates progression of the cell cycle from G\n1 \nto S phase. Furlanetto et al., \nMol. Endocrinol. \n8:510-517 (1994); Dufourny et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n272:311663-31171 (1997). Suppression of cyclin D1 expression in pancreatic cancer cells abolished the mitogenic effect of IGF-I. Kornmann et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n101:344-352 (1998). In addition to stimulating cell cycle progression, IGF-I also inhibits apoptosis. IGF-I was shown to stimulate the expression of Bcl proteins and to suppress expression of Bax, which results in an increase in the relative amount of the Bcl/Bax heterodimer, thereby blocking initiation of the apoptotic pathway. Minshall et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n159:1225-1232 (1997); Parrizas et al., \nEndocrinology \n138:1355-1358 (1997); Wang et al., \nEndocrinology \n139:1354-1360 (1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLike IGF-I, IGF-II also has mitogenic and antiapoptotic actions and regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. Compared with IGF-I, high concentrations of IGF-II circulate in serum. High serum IGF-II concentrations have been found in patients with colorectal cancer, with a trend towards higher concentrations in advanced disease. Renehan et al., \nBr. J. Cancer \n83:1344-1350. Additionally, most primary tumors and transformed cell lines overexpress IGF-II mRNA and protein. Werner and LeRoith \nAdv. Cancer Res. \n68:183-223 (1996). Overexpression of IGF-II in colon cancer is associated with an aggressive phenotype, and the loss of imprinting (loss of allele-specific expression) of the IGF-II gene may be important in colorectal carcinogenesis. Michell et al., \nBr. J. Cancer \n76:60-66 (1997); Takano et al., \nOncology \n59:210-216 (2000). Cancer cells with a strong tendency to metastasize have four-fold higher levels of IGF-II expression than those cells with a low ability to metastasize. Guerra et al., \nInt. J. Cancer \n65:812-820 (1996).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResearch and clinical studies have highlighted the role of the IGF family members in the development, maintenance and progression of cancer. Many cancer cells have been shown to overexpress the IGF-IR and/or the IGF ligands. For example, IGF-I and IGF-II are strong mitogens for a wide variety of cancer cell lines, including sarcoma, leukemia, and cancers of the prostate, breast, lung, colon, stomach, esophagus, liver, pancreas, kidney, thyroid, brain, ovary, and uterus. Macaulay et al., \nBr. J. Cancer \n65:311-320 (1992); Oku et al., \nAnticancer Res. \n11:1591-1595 (1991); LeRoith et al., \nAnn. Intern. Med. \n122:54-59 (1995); Yaginuma et al., \nOncology \n54:502-507 (1997); Singh et al., \nEndocrinology \n137:1764-1774 (1996); Frostad et al., \nEur. J. Haematol \n62:191-198 (1999). When IGF-I was administered to malignant colon cancer cells, they became resistant to cytokine-induced apoptosis. Remade-Bonnet et al., \nCancer Res. \n60:2007-2017 (2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe role of IGFs in cancer is also supported by epidemiologic studies, which showed that high levels of circulating IGF-I and low levels of IGFBP-3 are associated with an increased risk for development of several common cancers (prostate, breast, colorectal and lung). Mantzoros et al., \nBr. J. Cancer \n76:1115-1118 (1997); Hankinson et al., \nLancet \n351:1393-1396 (1998); Ma et al., \nJ. Natl. Cancer Inst. \n91:620-625 (1999); Karasik et al., \nJ. Clin. Endocrinol Metab. \n78:271-276 (1994). These results suggest that IGF-I and IGF-II act as powerful mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signals, and that their overexpression correlates with poor prognosis in patients with several types of cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing knockout mouse models, several studies have further established the role of IGFs in tumor growth. With the development of the technology for tissue specific, conditional gene deletion, a mouse model of liver IGF-I deficiency (LID) was developed. Liver-specific deletion of the igf1 gene abrogated expression of IGF-I mRNA and caused a dramatic reduction in circulating IGF-I levels. Yakar, et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n96:7324-7329 (1999). When mammary tumors were induced in the LID mouse, reduced circulating IGF-1 levels resulted in significant reductions in cancer development, growth, and metastases, whereas increased circulating IGF-1 levels were associated with enhanced tumor growth. Wu et al., \nCancer Res. \n63:4384-4388 (2003).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral papers have reported that inhibition of IGF-IR expression and/or signaling leads to inhibition of tumor growth, both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of IGF signaling has also been shown to increase the susceptibility of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents. A variety of strategies (antisense oligonucleotides, soluble receptor, inhibitory peptides, dominant negative receptor mutants, small molecules inhibiting the kinase activity and anti-hIGF-IR antibodies) have been developed to inhibit the IGF-IR signaling pathway in tumor cells. One approach has been to target the kinase activity of IGF-IR with small molecule inhibitors. Two compounds were recently identified as small molecule kinase inhibitors capable of selectively inhibiting the IGF-IR. Garcia-Echeverria et al., \nCancer Cell \n5:231-239 (2004); Mitsiades et al., \nCancer Cell \n5:221-230 (2004). Inhibition of IGF-IR kinase activity abrogated IGF-1-mediated survival and colony formation in soft agar of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Garcia-Echeverria et al., \nCancer Cell \n5:231-239 (2004). When an IGF-IR. kinase inhibitor was administered to mice bearing tumor xenografts, IGF-IR signaling in tumor xenografts was inhibited and the growth of IGF-IR-driven fibrosarcomas was significantly reduced. Garcia-Echeverria et al., \nCancer Cell \n5:231-239 (2004). A similar effect was observed on hematologic malignancies, especially multiple myeloma. In multiple myeloma cells, a small molecule IGF-IR kinase inhibitor demonstrated a >16-fold greater potency against the IGF-1R, as compared to the insulin receptor, and was similarly effective in inhibiting cell growth and survival. Mitsiades et al., \nCancer Cell \n5:221-230 (2004). The same compound was injected intraperitoneally into mice and inhibited multiple myeloma cell growth and enhanced survival of the mice. Mitsiades et al., \nCancer Cell \n5:221-230 (2004). When combined with other chemotherapeutics at subtherapeutic doses, inhibition of IGF-IR kinase activity synergistically reduced tumor burden. Mitsiades et al., \nCancer Cell \n5:221-230 (2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother approach to inhibit IGF signaling has been the development of neutralizing antibodies directed against the receptor IGF-IR. Various groups have developed antibodies to IGF-IR that inhibit receptor IGF-1-stimulated autophosphorylation, induce receptor internalization and degradation, and reduce proliferation and survival of diverse human cancer cell lines. Hailey et al., \nMol Cancer Ther. \n1:1349-1353 (2002); Maloney et al., \nCancer Res. \n63:5073-5083 (2003); Benini et al., \nClin. Cancer Res. \n7:1790-1797 (2001); Burtrum et al., \nCancer. Res. \n63:8912-8921 (2003). Additionally, in xenograft tumor models, IGF-IR blockade resulted in significant growth inhibition of breast, renal and pancreatic tumors in vivo. Burtrum et al., \nCancer Res. \n63:8912-8921 (2003); Maloney et al., \nCancer Res. \n63:5073-5083 (2003). Experiments utilizing chimeric humanized IGF-IR antibodies yielded similar results, inhibiting growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in tumor xenografts. Sachdev et al., \nCancer Res. \n63:627-635 (2003). Other humanized IGF-IR antibodies blocked IGF-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and growth inhibition in breast and non small cell lung tumors, as well as in vivo. Cohen et al., \nClin. Cancer Res. \n11:2063-2073 (2005); Goetsch et al., \nInt. J. Cancer \n113:316-328 (2005).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased IGF-I levels have also been associated with several non-cancerous pathological conditions, including acromegaly and gigantism (Barkan, Cleveland Clin. J. Med. 65: 343, 347-349, 1998), while abnormal IGF-I/IGF-II receptor function has been implicated in psoriasis (Wraight et al., Nat. Biotech. 18: 521-526, 2000), atherosclerosis and smooth muscle restenosis of blood vessels following angioplasty (Bayes-Genis et al., Circ. Res. 86: 125-130, 2000). Increased IGF-I levels have been implicated in diabetes or in complications associated with diabetes, such as microvascular proliferation (Smith et al., Nat. Med. 5: 1390-1395, 1999).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies to IGF-I and IGF-II have been disclosed in the art. See, for example, Goya et al., \nCancer Res. \n64:6252-6258 (2004); Miyamoto et al., \nClin. Cancer Res. \n11:3494-3502 (2005). Additionally, see WO 05/18671, WO 05/28515 and WO 03/93317.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nEmbodiments of the invention relate to binding proteins that specifically bind to insulin-like growth factors and reduce tumor growth.

In some embodiments, the binding proteins are antibodies, or binding fragments thereof, and bind to IGF-II with cross-reactivity to IGF-I and inhibit the binding of these proteins to their receptor, IGF-IR. Other embodiments of the invention include fully human neutralizing anti-IGF-I/II antibodies, and antibody preparations that are therapeutically useful and bind both insulin-like growth factors. Such anti-IGF-I/II antibody preparations preferably have desirable therapeutic properties, including strong binding affinity for IGF-I/II, the ability to neutralize IGF-UII in vitro, and the ability to inhibit IGF-I/II-induced cell proliferation in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmbodiments of the invention also include isolated binding fragments of anti-IGF-I/II antibodies. Preferably, the binding fragments are derived from fully human anti-IGF-I/II antibodies. Exemplary fragments include Fv, Fab′ or other well know antibody fragments, as described in more detail below. Embodiments of the invention also include cells that express fully human antibodies against IGF-I/II. Examples of cells include hybridomas, or recombinantly created cells, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that produce antibodies against IGF-I/II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, embodiments of the invention include methods of using these antibodies, for treating diseases. Anti-IGF-I/II antibodies are useful for preventing IGF-UII mediated IGF-UII signal transduction, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. The mechanism of action of this inhibition may include inhibition of IGF-I/II from binding to its receptor, IGF-IR, inhibition of IGF-I/II induced IGF-IR signaling, or enhanced clearance of IGF-UII therein lowering the effective concentration of IGF-I/II for binding to IGF-IR. Diseases that are treatable through this inhibition mechanism include, but are not limited to, neoplastic diseases, such as, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, glioma, hepatocellular (liver) carcinoma, gynecologic tumors, head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, glioblastoma, and cancers and tumors of the thyroid, stomach, prostrate, breast, ovary, bladder, lung, uterus, kidney, colon, and pancreas, salivary gland, and colorectum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther embodiments of the invention include diagnostic assays for specifically determining the quantity of IGF-I/II in a biological sample. The assay kit can include anti-IGF-I/II antibodies along with the necessary labels for detecting such antibodies. These diagnostic assays are useful to screen for growth factor-related diseases including, but not limited to, neoplastic diseases, such as, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, glioma, hepatocellular (liver) carcinoma, gynecologic tumors, head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, glioblastoma, and carcinoma of the thyroid, stomach, prostrate, breast, ovary, bladder, lung, uterus, kidney, colon, and pancreas, salivary gland, and colorectum. Other non-neoplastic disease conditions may include acromegaly and gigantism, psoriasis, osteoporosis, atherosclerosis and smooth muscle restenosis of blood vessels, as well as diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther embodiments, features, and the like regarding anti-IGF-I/II antibodies are provided in additional detail below.\n\n\n \nSequence Listing\n\n\n \n \n \nEmbodiments of the invention include the specific anti-IGF-I/II antibodies listed below in Table 1. This table reports the identification number of each anti-IGF-I/II antibody, along with the SEQ ID number of the corresponding heavy chain and light chain genes. Further, the germline sequences from which each heavy chain and light chain derive are also provided below in Table 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach antibody has been given an identification number that includes either two or three numbers separated by one or two decimal points. In some cases, several clones of one antibody were prepared. Although the clones have the identical nucleic acid and amino acid sequences as the parent sequence, they may also be listed separately, with the clone number indicated by the number to the right of a second decimal point. Thus, for example, the nucleic acid and amino acid sequences of antibody 7.159.2 are identical to the sequences of antibody 7.159.1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs can be seen by comparing the sequences in the sequence listing, SEQ ID NOs.: 1-20 differ from SEQ ID NOs.: 39-58 because SEQ ID NOs.: 39-58 include the untranslated, signal peptide, and constant domain regions for each sequenced heavy or light chain.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmAb ID No.:\n\n\nSequence\n\n\nSEQ ID NO:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.158.1\n\n\nNucleotide

defined, scientific and technical terms used herein shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular. Generally, nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and techniques of, cell and tissue culture, molecular biology, and protein and oligo- or polynucleotide chemistry and hybridization described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStandard techniques are used for recombinant DNA, oligonucleotide synthesis, and tissue culture and transformation (e.g., electroporation, lipofection). Enzymatic reactions and purification techniques are performed according to manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The foregoing techniques and procedures are generally performed according to conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification. See e.g., Sambrook et al. \nMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual \n(3rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (2001)), which is incorporated herein by reference. The nomenclatures utilized in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those well known and commonly used in the art. Standard techniques are used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs utilized in accordance with the present disclosure, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “IGF-I” refers to the molecule Insulin-like growth factor-I, and the term “IGF-II” refers to the molecule Insulin-like growth factor-II. The term “IGF-I/II” refers to both molecules Insulin-like growth factors-I and -II, and relates to the preferential binding to IGF-II with cross-reactivity to IGF-I. Thus, an antibody that binds to IGF-I/II will preferentially bind to IGF-II, but would cross-react with IGF-I, binding to IGF-II with higher affinity than to IGF-I. For example, the antibody can bind to IGF-II with 2.5 times greater affinity than to IGF-I. In certain embodiments, the antibody can bind to IGF-II with at least 5, at least 10, at least 25, at least 50 or at least 150 times greater affinity than to IGF-I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “neutralizing” when referring to an antibody relates to the ability of an antibody to eliminate, or significantly reduce, the activity of a target antigen. Accordingly, a “neutralizing” anti-IGF-I/II antibody is capable of eliminating or significantly reducing the activity of IGF-I/II. A neutralizing IGF-I/II antibody may, for example, act by blocking the binding of IGF-UII to its receptor IGF-IR. By blocking this binding, the IGF-IR mediated signal transduction is significantly, or completely, eliminated. Ideally, a neutralizing antibody against IGF-I/II inhibits cell proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “isolated polynucleotide” as used herein shall mean a polynucleotide that has been isolated from its naturally occurring environment. Such polynucleotides may be genomic, cDNA, or synthetic. Isolated polynucleotides preferably are not associated with all or a portion of the polynucleotides they associate with in nature. The isolated polynucleotides may be operably linked to another polynucleotide that it is not linked to in nature. In addition, isolated polynucleotides preferably do not occur in nature as part of a larger sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “isolated protein” referred to herein means a protein that has been isolated from its naturally occurring environment. Such proteins may be derived from genomic DNA, cDNA, recombinant DNA, recombinant RNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof, which by virtue of its origin, or source of derivation, the “isolated protein” (1) is not associated with proteins found in nature, (2) is free of other proteins from the same source, e.g. free of murine proteins, (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, or (4) does not occur in nature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polypeptide” is used herein as a generic term to refer to native protein, fragments, or analogs of a polypeptide sequence. Hence, native protein, fragments, and analogs are species of the polypeptide genus. Preferred polypeptides in accordance with the invention comprise the human heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules and the human kappa light chain immunoglobulin molecules, as well as antibody molecules formed by combinations comprising the heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules with light chain immunoglobulin molecules, such as the kappa or lambda light chain immunoglobulin molecules, and vice versa, as well as fragments and analogs thereof. Preferred polypeptides in accordance with the invention may also comprise solely the human heavy chain immunoglobulin molecules or fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “naturally-occurring” as used herein as applied to an object refers to the fact that an object can be found in nature. For example, a polypeptide or polynucleotide sequence that is present in an organism (including viruses) that can be isolated from a source in nature and which has not been intentionally modified by man in the laboratory or otherwise is naturally-occurring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “operably linked” as used herein refers to positions of components so described that are in a relationship permitting them to function in their intended manner. For example, a control sequence “operably linked” to a coding sequence is connected in such a way that expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions compatible with the control sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polynucleotide” as referred to herein means a polymeric form of nucleotides of at least 10 bases in length, either ribonucleotides or deoxynucleotides or a modified form of either type of nucleotide, or RNA-DNA hetero-duplexes. The term includes single and double stranded forms of DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “oligonucleotide” referred to herein includes naturally occurring, and modified nucleotides linked together by naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring linkages. Oligonucleotides are a polynucleotide subset generally comprising a length of 200 bases or fewer. Preferably, oligonucleotides are 10 to 60 bases in length and most preferably 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 to 40 bases in length. Oligonucleotides are usually single stranded, e.g. for probes; although oligonucleotides may be double stranded, e.g. for use in the construction of a gene mutant. Oligonucleotides can be either sense or antisense oligonucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “naturally occurring nucleotides” referred to herein includes deoxyribonucleotides and ribonucleotides. The term “modified nucleotides” referred to herein includes nucleotides with modified or substituted sugar groups and the like. The term “oligonucleotide linkages” referred to herein includes oligonucleotides linkages such as phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, phosphoroselenoate, phosphorodiselenoate, phosphoroanilothioate, phosphoraniladate, phosphoroamidate, and the like. See e.g., LaPlanche et al. \nNucl. Acids Res. \n14:9081 (1986); Stec et al. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n106:6077 (1984); Stein et al. \nNucl. Acids Res. \n16:3209 (1988); Zon et al. \nAnti\n-\nCancer Drug Design \n6:539 (1991); Zon et al. \nOligonucleotides and Analogues: A Practical Approach\n, pp. 87-108 (F. Eckstein, Ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford England (1991)); Stec et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,151,510; Uhlmann and Peyman \nChemical Reviews \n90:543 (1990), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. An oligonucleotide can include a label for detection, if desired.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “selectively hybridize” referred to herein means to detectably and specifically bind. Polynucleotides, oligonucleotides and fragments thereof selectively hybridize to nucleic acid strands under hybridization and wash conditions that minimize appreciable amounts of detectable binding to nonspecific nucleic acids. High stringency conditions can be used to achieve selective hybridization conditions as known in the art and discussed herein. Generally, the nucleic acid sequence homology between the polynucleotides, oligonucleotides, or antibody fragments and a nucleic acid sequence of interest will be at least 80%, and more typically with preferably increasing homologies of at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, and 100%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo amino acid sequences are “homologous” if there is a partial or complete identity between their sequences. For example, 85% homology means that 85% of the amino acids are identical when the two sequences are aligned for maximum matching. Gaps (in either of the two sequences being matched) are allowed in maximizing matching; gap lengths of 5 or less are preferred with 2 or less being more preferred. Alternatively and preferably, two protein sequences (or polypeptide sequences derived from them of at least about 30 amino acids in length) are homologous, as this term is used herein, if they have an alignment score of at more than 5 (in standard deviation units) using the program ALIGN with the mutation data matrix and a gap penalty of 6 or greater. See Dayhoff, M. O., in \nAtlas of Protein Sequence and Structure\n, pp. 101-110 (\nVolume\n 5, National Biomedical Research Foundation (1972)) and \nSupplement\n 2 to this volume, pp. 1-10. The two sequences or parts thereof are more preferably homologous if their amino acids are greater than or equal to 50% identical when optimally aligned using the ALIGN program. It should be appreciated that there can be differing regions of homology within two orthologous sequences. For example, the functional sites of mouse and human orthologues may have a higher degree of homology than non-functional regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “corresponds to” is used herein to mean that a polynucleotide sequence is homologous (i.e., is identical, not strictly evolutionarily related) to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence, or that a polypeptide sequence is identical to a reference polypeptide sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contradistinction, the term “complementary to” is used herein to mean that the complementary sequence is homologous to all or a portion of a reference polynucleotide sequence. For illustration, the nucleotide sequence “TATAC” corresponds to a reference sequence “TATAC” and is complementary to a reference sequence “GTATA”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two or more polynucleotide or amino acid sequences: “reference sequence”, “comparison window”, “sequence identity”, “percentage of sequence identity”, and “substantial identity”. A “reference sequence” is a defined sequence used as a basis for a sequence comparison. A reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence, for example, as a segment of a full-length cDNA or gene sequence given in a sequence listing or may comprise a complete cDNA or gene sequence. Generally, a reference sequence is at least 18 nucleotides or 6 amino acids in length, frequently at least 24 nucleotides or 8 amino acids in length, and often at least 48 nucleotides or 16 amino acids in length. Since two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences may each (1) comprise a sequence (i.e., a portion of the complete polynucleotide or amino acid sequence) that is similar between the two molecules, and (2) may further comprise a sequence that is divergent between the two polynucleotides or amino acid sequences, sequence comparisons between two (or more) molecules are typically performed by comparing sequences of the two molecules over a “comparison window” to identify and compare local regions of sequence similarity. A “comparison window”, as used herein, refers to a conceptual segment of at least about 18 contiguous nucleotide positions or about 6 amino acids wherein the polynucleotide sequence or amino acid sequence is compared to a reference sequence of at least 18 contiguous nucleotides or 6 amino acid sequences and wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may include additions, deletions, substitutions, and the like (i.e., gaps) of 20 percent or less as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Optimal alignment of sequences for aligning a comparison window may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman \nAdv. Appl. Math. \n2:482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n48:443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci\n. (\nU.S.A\n.) 85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, (Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), GENEWORKS™, or MACVECTOR® software packages), or by inspection, and the best alignment (i.e., resulting in the highest percentage of homology over the comparison window) generated by the various methods is selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “sequence identity” means that two polynucleotide or amino acid sequences are identical (i.e., on a nucleotide-by-nucleotide or residue-by-residue basis) over the comparison window. The term “percentage of sequence identity” is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over the window of comparison, determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base (e.g., A, T, C, G, U, or I) or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the comparison window (i.e., the window size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. The terms “substantial identity” as used herein denotes a characteristic of a polynucleotide or amino acid sequence, wherein the polynucleotide or amino acid comprises a sequence that has at least 85 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 to 95 percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 99 percent sequence identity, as compared to a reference sequence over a comparison window of at least 18 nucleotide (6 amino acid) positions, frequently over a window of at least 24-48 nucleotide (8-16 amino acid) positions, wherein the percentage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing the reference sequence to the sequence which may include deletions or additions which total 20 percent or less of the reference sequence over the comparison window. The reference sequence may be a subset of a larger sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the twenty conventional amino acids and their abbreviations follow conventional usage. See \nImmunology—A Synthesis \n(2\nnd \nEdition, E. S. Golub and D. R. Gren, Eds., Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, Mass. (1991)), which is incorporated herein by reference. Stereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the twenty conventional amino acids, unnatural amino acids such as α-, α-disubstituted amino acids, N-alkyl amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino acids may also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present invention. Examples of unconventional amino acids include: 4-hydroxyproline, γ-carboxyglutamate, ε-N,N,N-trimethyllysine, ε-N-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3-methylhistidine, 5-hydroxylysine, σ-N-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and imino acids (e.g., 4-hydroxyproline). In the polypeptide notation used herein, the left-hand direction is the amino terminal direction and the right-hand direction is the carboxy-terminal direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, unless specified otherwise, the left-hand end of single-stranded polynucleotide sequences is the 5′ end; the left-hand direction of double-stranded polynucleotide sequences is referred to as the 5′ direction. The direction of 5′ to 3′ addition of nascent RNA transcripts is referred to as the transcription direction; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 5′ to the 5′ end of the RNA transcript are referred to as “upstream sequences”; sequence regions on the DNA strand having the same sequence as the RNA and which are 3′ to the 3′ end of the RNA transcript are referred to as “downstream sequences”.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs applied to polypeptides, the term “substantial identity” means that two peptide sequences, when optimally aligned, such as by the programs GAP or BESTFIT using default gap weights, share at least 80 percent sequence identity, preferably at least 90 percent sequence identity, more preferably at least 95 percent sequence identity, and most preferably at least 99 percent sequence identity. Preferably, residue positions that are not identical differ by conservative amino acid substitutions. Conservative amino acid substitutions refer to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains. For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-containing side chains is cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, glutamic-aspartic, and asparagine-glutamine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs discussed herein, minor variations in the amino acid sequences of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules are contemplated as being encompassed by the present invention, providing that the variations in the amino acid sequence maintain at least 75%, more preferably at least 80%, 90%, 95%, and most preferably 99% sequence identity to the antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules described herein. In particular, conservative amino acid replacements are contemplated. Conservative replacements are those that take place within a family of amino acids that have related side chains. Genetically encoded amino acids are generally divided into families: (1) acidic=aspartate, glutamate; (2) basic=lysine, arginine, histidine; (3) non-polar=alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan; and (4) uncharged polar=glycine, asparagine, glutamine, cysteine, serine, threonine, tyrosine. More preferred families are: serine and threonine are an aliphatic-hydroxy family; asparagine and glutamine are an amide-containing family; alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine are an aliphatic family; and phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are an aromatic family. For example, it is reasonable to expect that an isolated replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine, an aspartate with a glutamate, a threonine with a serine, or a similar replacement of an amino acid with a structurally related amino acid will not have a major effect on the binding function or properties of the resulting molecule, especially if the replacement does not involve an amino acid within a framework site. Whether an amino acid change results in a functional peptide can readily be determined by assaying the specific activity of the polypeptide derivative. Assays are described in detail herein. Fragments or analogs of antibodies or immunoglobulin molecules can be readily prepared by those of ordinary skill in the art. Preferred amino- and carboxy-termini of fragments or analogs occur near boundaries of functional domains. Structural and functional domains can be identified by comparison of the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data to public or proprietary sequence databases. Preferably, computerized comparison methods are used to identify sequence motifs or predicted protein conformation domains that occur in other proteins of known structure and/or function. Methods to identify protein sequences that fold into a known three-dimensional structure are known. Bowie et al. \nScience \n253:164 (1991). Thus, the foregoing examples demonstrate that those of skill in the art can recognize sequence motifs and structural conformations that may be used to define structural and functional domains in accordance with the antibodies described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred amino acid substitutions are those which: (1) reduce susceptibility to proteolysis, (2) reduce susceptibility to oxidation, (3) alter binding affinity for forming protein complexes, (4) alter binding affinities, and (5) confer or modify other physicochemical or functional properties of such analogs. Analogs can include various muteins of a sequence other than the naturally-occurring peptide sequence. For example, single or multiple amino acid substitutions (preferably conservative amino acid substitutions) may be made in the naturally-occurring sequence (preferably in the portion of the polypeptide outside the domain(s) forming intermolecular contacts. A conservative amino acid substitution should not substantially change the structural characteristics of the parent sequence (e.g., a replacement amino acid should not tend to break a helix that occurs in the parent sequence, or disrupt other types of secondary structure that characterizes the parent sequence). Examples of art-recognized polypeptide secondary and tertiary structures are described in \nProteins, Structures and Molecular Principles \n(Creighton, Ed., W. H. Freeman and Company, New York (1984)); \nIntroduction to Protein Structure \n(C. Branden and J. Tooze, eds., Garland Publishing, New York, N.Y. (1991)); and Thornton et at. \nNature \n354:105 (1991), which are each incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “polypeptide fragment” as used herein refers to a polypeptide that has an amino-terminal and/or carboxy-terminal deletion, but where the remaining amino acid sequence is identical to the corresponding positions in the naturally-occurring sequence deduced, for example, from a full-length cDNA sequence. Fragments typically are at least 5, 6, 8 or 10 amino acids long, preferably at least 14 amino acids long, more preferably at least 20 amino acids long, usually at least 50 amino acids long, and even more preferably at least 70 amino acids long. The term “analog” as used herein refers to polypeptides which are comprised of a segment of at least 25 amino acids that has substantial identity to a portion of a deduced amino acid sequence and which has at least one of the following properties: (1) specific binding to IGF-I/II, under suitable binding conditions, (2) ability to block appropriate IGF-I/II binding, or (3) ability to inhibit IGF-I/II activity. Typically, polypeptide analogs comprise a conservative amino acid substitution (or addition or deletion) with respect to the naturally-occurring sequence. Analogs typically are at least 20 amino acids long, preferably at least 50 amino acids long or longer, and can often be as long as a full-length naturally-occurring polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide analogs are commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry as non-peptide drugs with properties analogous to those of the template peptide. These types of non-peptide compound are termed “peptide mimetics” or “peptidomimetics”. Fauchere, \nJ. Adv. Drug Res. \n15:29 (1986); Veber and Freidinger TINS p. 392 (1985); and Evans et al. \nJ. Med. Chem. \n30:1229 (1987), which are incorporated herein by reference. Such compounds are often developed with the aid of computerized molecular modeling. Peptide mimetics that are structurally similar to therapeutically useful peptides may be used to produce an equivalent therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Generally, peptidomimetics are structurally similar to a paradigm polypeptide (i.e., a polypeptide that has a biochemical property or pharmacological activity), such as human antibody, but have one or more peptide linkages optionally replaced by a linkage selected from the group consisting of: —CH\n2\nNH—, —CH\n2\nS—, —CH\n2\n—CH\n2\n—, —CH═CH—(cis and trans), —COCH\n2\n—, —CH(OH)CH\n2\n—, and —CH\n2\nSO—, by methods well known in the art. Systematic substitution of one or more amino acids of a consensus sequence with a D-amino acid of the same type (e.g., D-lysine in place of L-lysine) may be used to generate more stable peptides. In addition, constrained peptides comprising a consensus sequence or a substantially identical consensus sequence variation may be generated by methods known in the art (Rizo and Gierasch \nAnn. Rev. Biochem. \n61:387 (1992), incorporated herein by reference); for example, by adding internal cysteine residues capable of forming intramolecular disulfide bridges which cyclize the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “antibody” refers to a polypeptide or group of polypeptides that are comprised of at least one binding domain that is formed from the folding of polypeptide chains having three-dimensional binding spaces with internal surface shapes and charge distributions complementary to the features of an antigenic determinant of an antigen. An antibody typically has a tetrameric form, comprising two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one “light” and one “heavy” chain. The variable regions of each light/heavy chain pair form an antibody binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Binding fragments” of an antibody are produced by recombinant DNA techniques, or by enzymatic or chemical cleavage of intact antibodies. Binding fragments include Fab, Fab′, F(ab)\n2\n, Fv, and single-chain antibodies. An antibody other than a “bispecific” or “bifunctional” antibody is understood to have each of its binding sites identical. An antibody substantially inhibits adhesion of a receptor to a counterreceptor when an excess of antibody reduces the quantity of receptor bound to counterreceptor by at least about 20%, 40%, 60% or 80%, and more usually greater than about 85% (as measured in an in vitro competitive binding assay).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “binding protein” or a “specific binding protein” are proteins that specifically bind to a target molecule. Antibodies, and binding fragments of antibodies, are binding proteins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “epitope” includes any protein determinant capable of specific binding to an immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and may, but not always, have specific three-dimensional structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics. An antibody is said to specifically bind an antigen when the dissociation constant is ≦1 μM, preferably ≦100 nM and most preferably ≦10 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “agent” is used herein to denote a chemical compound, a mixture of chemical compounds, a biological macromolecule, or an extract made from biological materials.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Active” or “activity” in regard to an IGF-I/II polypeptide refers to a portion of an IGF-I/II polypeptide that has a biological or an immunological activity of a native IGF-I/II polypeptide. “Biological” when used herein refers to a biological function that results from the activity of the native IGF-I/II polypeptide. A preferred IGF-I/II biological activity includes, for example, IGF-I/II induced cell proliferation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Mammal” when used herein refers to any animal that is considered a mammal. Preferably, the mammal is human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDigestion of antibodies with the enzyme, papain, results in two identical antigen-binding fragments, known also as “Fab” fragments, and a “Fc” fragment, having no antigen-binding activity but having the ability to crystallize. Digestion of antibodies with the enzyme, pepsin, results in the a F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment in which the two arms of the antibody molecule remain linked and comprise two-antigen binding sites. The F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment has the ability to crosslink antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Fv” when used herein refers to the minimum fragment of an antibody that retains both antigen-recognition and antigen-binding sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Fab” when used herein refers to a fragment of an antibody that comprises the constant domain of the light chain and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “mAb” refers to monoclonal antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Liposome” when used herein refers to a small vesicle that may be useful for delivery of drugs that may include the IGF-I/II polypeptide of the invention or antibodies to such an IGF-I/II polypeptide to a mammal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Label” or “labeled” as used herein refers to the addition of a detectable moiety to a polypeptide, for example, a radiolabel, fluorescent label, enzymatic label chemiluminescent labeled or a biotinyl group. Radioisotopes or radionuclides may include \n3\nH, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n35\nS, \n90\nY, \n99\nTc, \n111\nIn, \n125\nI, \n131\nI, fluorescent labels may include rhodamine lanthanide phosphors or FITC and enzymatic labels may include horseradish peroxidase, β-galactosidase, luciferase, alkaline phosphatase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutical agent or drug” as used herein refers to a chemical compound or composition capable of inducing a desired therapeutic effect when properly administered to a patient. Other chemistry terms herein are used according to conventional usage in the art, as exemplified by \nThe McGraw\n-\nHill Dictionary of Chemical Terms \n(Parker, S., Ed., McGraw-Hill, San Francisco (1985)), (incorporated herein by reference).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “substantially pure” means an object species is the predominant species present (i.e., on a molar basis it is more abundant than any other individual species in the composition), and preferably a substantially purified fraction is a composition wherein the object species comprises at least about 50 percent (on a molar basis) of all macromolecular species present. Generally, a substantially pure composition will comprise more than about 80 percent of all macromolecular species present in the composition, more preferably more than about 85%, 90%, 95%, and 99%. Most preferably, the object species is purified to essential homogeneity (contaminant species cannot be detected in the composition by conventional detection methods) wherein the composition consists essentially of a single macromolecular species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “patient” includes human and veterinary subjects.\n\n\n \nHuman Antibodies and Humanization of Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman antibodies avoid some of the problems associated with antibodies that possess murine or rat variable and/or constant regions. The presence of such murine or rat derived proteins can lead to the rapid clearance of the antibodies or can lead to, the generation of an immune response against the antibody by a patient. In order to avoid the utilization of murine or rat derived antibodies, fully human antibodies can be generated through the introduction of functional human antibody loci into a rodent, other mammal or animal so that the rodent, other mammal or animal produces fully human antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne method for generating fully human antibodies is through the use of XenoMouse® strains of mice that have been engineered to contain up to but less than 1000 kb-sized germline configured fragments of the human heavy chain locus and kappa light chain locus. See Mendez et al. \nNature Genetics \n15:146-156 (1997) and Green and Jakobovits \nJ. Exp. Med. \n188:483-495 (1998). The XenoMouse® strains are available from Abgenix, Inc. (Fremont, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe production of the XenoMouse® strains of mice is further discussed and delineated in U.S. patent application Ser.

In the minilocus approach, an exogenous Ig locus is mimicked through the inclusion of pieces (individual genes) from the Ig locus. Thus, one or more V\nH \ngenes, one or more D\nH \ngenes, one or more J\nH \ngenes, a mu constant region, and usually a second constant region (preferably a gamma constant region) are formed into a construct for insertion into an animal.

These mice possess the human IgH transchromosome of the Kirin mice and the kappa chain transgene of the Genpharm mice (Ishida et al., Cloning Stem Cells, (2002) 4:91-102).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHuman antibodies can also be derived by in vitro methods. Suitable examples include but are not limited to phage display (CAT, Morphosys, Dyax, Biosite/Medarex, Xoma, Symphogen, Alexion (formerly Proliferon), Affimed) ribosome display (CAT), yeast display, and the like.\n\n\n \nPreparation of Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies, as described herein, were prepared through the utilization of the XenoMouse® technology, as described below. Such mice, then, are capable of producing human immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies and are deficient in the production of murine immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies. Technologies utilized for achieving the same are disclosed in the patents, applications, and references disclosed in the background section herein. In particular, however, a preferred embodiment of transgenic production of mice and antibodies therefrom is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/759,620, filed Dec. 3, 1996 and International Patent Application Nos. WO 98/24893, published Jun. 11, 1998 and WO 00/76310, published Dec. 21, 2000, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. See also Mendez et al. \nNature Genetics \n15:146-156 (1997), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThrough the use of such technology, fully human monoclonal antibodies to a variety of antigens have been produced. Essentially, XenoMouse® lines of mice are immunized with an antigen of interest (e.g. IGF-I/II), lymphatic cells (such as B-cells) are recovered from the hyper-immunized mice, and the recovered lymphocytes are fused with a myeloid-type cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines. These hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produced antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. Provided herein are methods for the production of multiple hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies specific to IGF-I/II. Further, provided herein are characterization of the antibodies produced by such cell lines, including nucleotide and amino acid sequence analyses of the heavy and light chains of such antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, instead of being fused to myeloma cells to generate hybridomas, B cells can be directly assayed. For example, CD19+ B cells can be isolated from hyperimmune XenoMouse® mice and allowed to proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Antibodies from the cell supernatants are then screened by ELISA for reactivity against the IGF-I/II immunogen. The supernatants might also be screened for immunoreactivity against fragments of IGF-I/II to further map the different antibodies for binding to domains of functional interest on IGF-I/II. The antibodies may also be screened against other related human chemokines and against the rat, the mouse, and non-human primate, such as cynomolgus monkey, orthologues of IGF-I/II, the last to determine species cross-reactivity. B cells from wells containing antibodies of interest may be immortalized by various methods including fusion to make hybridomas either from individual or from pooled wells, or by infection with EBV or transfection by known immortalizing genes and then plating in suitable medium. Alternatively, single plasma cells secreting antibodies with the desired specificities are then isolated using an IGF-I/II-specific hemolytic plaque assay (Babcook et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n93:7843-48 (1996)). Cells targeted for lysis are preferably sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) coated with the antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the presence of a B-cell culture containing plasma cells secreting the immunoglobulin of interest and complement, the formation of a plaque indicates specific IGF-I/II-mediated lysis of the sheep red blood cells surrounding the plasma cell of interest. The single antigen-specific plasma cell in the center of the plaque can be isolated and the genetic information that encodes the specificity of the antibody is isolated from the single plasma cell. Using reverse-transcription followed by PCR (RT-PCR), the DNA encoding the heavy and light chain variable regions of the antibody can be cloned. Such cloned DNA can then be further inserted into a suitable expression vector, preferably a vector cassette such as a pcDNA, more preferably such a pcDNA vector containing the constant domains of immunglobulin heavy and light chain. The generated vector can then be transfected into host cells, e.g., HEK293 cells, CHO cells, and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing transcription, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, antibodies produced by the fused hybridomas were human IgG2 heavy chains with fully human kappa or lambda light chains. Antibodies described herein possess human IgG4 heavy chains as well as IgG2 heavy chains. Antibodies can also be of other human isotypes, including IgG1. The antibodies possessed high affinities, typically possessing a Kd of from about 10\n−6 \nthrough about 10\n−12 \nM or below, when measured by solid phase and solution phase techniques. Antibodies possessing a KD of at least 10\n−11 \nM are preferred to inhibit the activity of IGF-I/II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be appreciated, anti-IGF-I/II antibodies can be expressed in cell lines other than hybridoma cell lines. Sequences encoding particular antibodies can be used to transform a suitable mammalian host cell. Transformation can be by any known method for introducing polynucleotides into a host cell, including, for example packaging the polynucleotide in a virus (or into a viral vector) and transducing a host cell with the virus (or vector) or by transfection procedures known in the art, as exemplified by U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,399,216, 4,912,040, 4,740,461, and 4,959,455 (which patents are hereby incorporated herein by reference). The transformation procedure used depends upon the host to be transformed. Methods for introducing heterologous polynucleotides into mammalian cells are well known in the art and include dextran-mediated transfection, calcium phosphate precipitation, polybrene mediated transfection, protoplast fusion, electroporation, encapsulation of the polynucleotide(s) in liposomes, and direct microinjection of the DNA into nuclei.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMammalian cell lines available as hosts for expression are well known in the art and include many immortalized cell lines available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), including but not limited to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney cells (COS), human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (e.g., Hep G2), human epithelial kidney 293 cells, and a number of other cell lines. Cell lines of particular preference are selected through determining which cell lines have high expression levels and produce antibodies with constitutive IGF-I/II binding properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IGF-I/II antibodies are useful in the detection of IGF-I/II in patient samples and accordingly are useful as diagnostics for disease states as described herein. In addition, based on their ability to significantly neutralize IGF-I/II activity (as demonstrated in the Examples below), anti-IGF-I/II antibodies have therapeutic effects in treating symptoms and conditions resulting from IGF-I/II expression. In specific embodiments, the antibodies and methods herein relate to the treatment of symptoms resulting from IGF-UII induced cell proliferation. Further embodiments involve using the antibodies and methods described herein to treat diseases including neoplastic diseases, such as, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, glioma, hepatocellular (liver) carcinoma, thyroid tumor, gastric (stomach) cancer, prostrate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer, lung cancer, glioblastoma, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer, colon cancer, gynecologic tumors, head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Other non-neoplastic disease conditions may include acromegaly and gigantism, psoriasis, osteoporosis, atherosclerosis and smooth muscle restenosis of blood vessels, as well as diabetes.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Administration and Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \nEmbodiments of the invention include sterile pharmaceutical formulations of anti-IGF-UII antibodies that are useful as treatments for diseases. Such formulations would inhibit the binding of IGF-I/II to its receptor IGF-IR, thereby effectively treating pathological conditions where, for example, serum or tissue IGF-I/II is abnormally elevated. Anti-IGF-I/II antibodies preferably possess adequate affinity to potently neutralize IGF-I/II, and preferably have an adequate duration of action to allow for infrequent dosing in humans. A prolonged duration of action will allow for less frequent and more convenient dosing schedules by alternate parenteral routes such as subcutaneous or intramuscular injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile formulations can be created, for example, by filtration through sterile filtration membranes, prior to or following lyophilization and reconstitution of the antibody. The antibody ordinarily will be stored in lyophilized form or in solution. Therapeutic antibody compositions generally are placed into a container having a sterile access port, for example, an intravenous solution bag or vial having an adapter that allows retrieval of the formulation, such as a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe route of antibody administration is in accord with known methods, e.g., injection or infusion by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intramuscular, intraocular, intraarterial, intrathecal, inhalation or intralesional routes, or by sustained release systems as noted below. The antibody is preferably administered continuously by infusion or by bolus injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn effective amount of antibody to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic objectives, the route of administration, and the condition of the patient. Accordingly, it is preferred that the therapist titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. Typically, the clinician will administer antibody until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional assays or by the assays described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies, as described herein, can be prepared in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This therapeutic composition can be administered intravenously or through the nose or lung, preferably as a liquid or powder aerosol (lyophilized). The composition may also be administered parenterally or subcutaneously as desired. When administered systemically, the therapeutic composition should be sterile, pyrogen-free and in a parenterally acceptable solution having due regard for pH, isotonicity, and stability. These conditions are known to those skilled in the art. Briefly, dosage formulations of the compounds described herein are prepared for storage or administration by mixing the compound having the desired degree of purity with physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers. Such materials are non-toxic to the recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as TRIS HCl, phosphate, citrate, acetate and other organic acid salts; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about ten residues) peptides such as polyarginine, proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidinone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, or arginine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including cellulose or its derivatives, glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; counterions such as sodium and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN, PLURONICS or polyethyleneglycol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice as described in \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy \n(20\nth \ned, Lippincott Williams & Wilkens Publishers (2003)). For example, dissolution or suspension of the active compound in a vehicle such as water or naturally occurring vegetable oil like sesame, peanut, or cottonseed oil or a synthetic fatty vehicle like ethyl oleate or the like may be desired. Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants and the like can be incorporated according to accepted pharmaceutical practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the polypeptide, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (e.g., poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) as described by Langer et al., \nJ. Biomed Mater. Res\n., (1981) 15:167-277 and Langer, \nChem. Tech\n., (1982) 12:98-105, or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919, EP 58,481), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma ethyl-L-glutamate (Sidman et al., \nBiopolymers\n, (1983) 22:547-556), non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate (Langer et al., supra), degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON Depot™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (EP 133,988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhile polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated proteins remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37° C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for protein stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S—S bond formation through disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSustained-released compositions also include preparations of crystals of the antibody suspended in suitable formulations capable of maintaining crystals in suspension. These preparations when injected subcutaneously or intraperitonealy can produce a sustained release effect. Other compositions also include liposomally entrapped antibodies. Liposomes containing such antibodies are prepared by methods known per se: U.S. Pat. No. DE 3,218,121; Epstein et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA\n, (1985) 82:3688-3692; Hwang et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA\n, (1980) 77:4030-4034; EP 52,322; EP 36,676; EP 88,046; EP 143,949; 142,641; Japanese patent application 83-118008; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,485,045 and 4,544,545; and EP 102,324.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage of the antibody formulation for a given patient will be determined by the attending physician taking into consideration various factors known to modify the action of drugs including severity and type of disease, body weight, sex, diet, time and route of administration, other medications and other relevant clinical factors. Therapeutically effective dosages may be determined by either in vitro or in vivo methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn effective amount of the antibodies, described herein, to be employed therapeutically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic objectives, the route of administration, and the condition of the patient. Accordingly, it is preferred for the therapist to titer the dosage and modify the route of administration as required to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. A typical daily dosage might range from about 0.001 mg/kg to up to 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. Typically, the clinician will administer the therapeutic antibody until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional assays or as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that administration of therapeutic entities in accordance with the compositions and methods herein will be administered with suitable carriers, excipients, and other agents that are incorporated into formulations to provide improved transfer, delivery, tolerance, and the like. These formulations include, for example, powders, pastes, ointments, jellies, waxes, oils, lipids, lipid (cationic or anionic) containing vesicles (such as Lipofectin™), DNA conjugates, anhydrous absorption pastes, oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, emulsions carbowax (polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights), semi-solid gels, and semi-solid mixtures containing carbowax. Any of the foregoing mixtures may be appropriate in treatments and therapies in accordance with the present invention, provided that the active ingredient in the formulation is not inactivated by the formulation and the formulation is physiologically compatible and tolerable with the route of administration.

Pharm. \n203(1-2):1-60 (2000), Charman WN “Lipids, lipophilic drugs, and oral drug delivery-some emerging concepts.” \nJ Pharm Sci. \n89(8):967-78 (2000), Powell et al. “Compendium of excipients for parenteral formulations” \nPDA J Pharm Sci Technol. \n52:238-311 (1998) and the citations therein for additional information related to formulations, excipients and carriers well known to pharmaceutical chemists.\n\n\n \nDesign and Generation of Other Therapeutics\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention and based on the activity of the antibodies that are produced and characterized herein with respect to IGF-I/II, the design of other therapeutic modalities is facilitated and disclosed to one of skill in the art. Such modalities include, without limitation, advanced antibody therapeutics, such as bispecific antibodies, immunotoxins, radiolabeled therapeutics, and single antibody V domains, antibody-like binding agent based on other than V region scaffolds, generation of peptide therapeutics, gene therapies, particularly intrabodies, antisense therapeutics, and small molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn connection with the generation of advanced antibody therapeutics, where complement fixation is a desirable attribute, it can be possible to sidestep the dependence on complement for cell killing through the use of bispecifics, immunotoxins, or radiolabels, for example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, bispecific antibodies can be generated that comprise (i) two antibodies, one with a specificity to IGF-I/II and another to a second molecule, that are conjugated together, (ii) a single antibody that has one chain specific to IGF-I/II and a second chain specific to a second molecule, or (iii) a single chain antibody that has specificity to both IGF-I/II and the other molecule. Such bispecific antibodies can be generated using techniques that are well known; for example, in connection with (i) and (ii) see e.g., Fanger et al. \nImmunol Methods \n4:72-81 (1994) and Wright and Harris, supra. and in connection with (iii) see e.g., Traunecker et al. \nInt. J. Cancer \n(\nSuppl\n.) 7:51-52 (1992). In each case, the second specificity can be made as desired. For example, the second specificity can be made to the heavy chain activation receptors, including, without limitation, CD16 or CD64 (see e.g., Deo et al. 18:127 (1997)) or CD89 (see e.g., Valerius et al. \nBlood \n90:4485-4492 (1997)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies can also be modified to act as immunotoxins utilizing techniques that are well known in the art. See e.g., Vitetta \nImmunol Today \n14:252 (1993). See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,194,594. In connection with the preparation of radiolabeled antibodies, such modified antibodies can also be readily prepared utilizing techniques that are well known in the art. See e.g., Junghans et al. in \nCancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy \n655-686 (2d edition, Chafner and Longo, eds., Lippincott Raven (1996)). See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,681,581, 4,735,210, 5,101,827, 5,102,990 (RE 35,500), 5,648,471, and 5,697,902. Each of immunotoxins and radiolabeled molecules would be likely to kill cells expressing the desired multimeric enzyme subunit oligomerization domain. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of the antibody in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent is provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an anti-IGF-I/II antibody is linked to an agent (e.g., radioisotope, pharmaceutical composition, or a toxin). Preferably, such antibodies can be used for the treatment of diseases, such diseases can relate to cells expressing IGF-I/II or cells overexpressing IGF-I/II. For example, it is contemplated that the drug possesses the pharmaceutical property selected from the group of antimitotic, alkylating, antimetabolite, antiangiogenic, apoptotic, alkaloid, COX-2, and antibiotic agents and combinations thereof. The drug can be selected from the group of nitrogen mustards, ethylenimine derivatives, alkyl sulfonates, nitrosoureas, triazenes, folic acid analogs, anthracyclines, taxanes, COX-2 inhibitors, pyrimidine analogs, purine analogs, antimetabolites, antibiotics, enzymes, epipodophyllotoxins, platinum coordination complexes, vinca alkaloids, substituted ureas, methyl hydrazine derivatives, adrenocortical suppressants, antagonists, endostatin, taxols, camptothecins, oxaliplatin, doxorubicins and their analogs, and a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of toxins further include gelonin, Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE), PE40, PE38, diphtheria toxin, ricin, ricin, abrin, alpha toxin, saporin, ribonuclease (RNase), DNase I, Staphylococcal enterotoxin-A, pokeweed antiviral protein, gelonin, Pseudomonas endotoxin, as well as derivatives, combinations and modifications thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of radioisotopes include gamma-emitters, positron-emitters, and x-ray emitters that can be used for localization and/or therapy, and beta-emitters and alpha-emitters that can be used for therapy. The radioisotopes described previously as useful for diagnostics, prognostics and staging are also useful for therapeutics. Non-limiting examples of anti-cancer or anti-leukemia agents include anthracyclines such as doxorubicin (adriamycin), daunorubicin (daunomycin), idarubicin, detorubicin, caminomycin, epirubicin, esorubicin, and morpholino and substituted derivatives, combinations and modifications thereof. Exemplary pharmaceutical agents include cis-platinum, taxol, calicheamicin, vincristine, cytarabine (Ara-C), cyclophosphamide, prednisone, daunorubicin, idarubicin, fludarabine, chlorambucil, interferon alpha, hydroxyurea, temozolomide, thalidomide, and bleomycin, and derivatives, combinations and modifications thereof. Preferably, the anti-cancer or anti-leukemia is doxorubicin, morpholinodoxorubicin, or morpholinodaunorubicin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, in the above embodiments, while affinity values can be important, other factors can be as important or more so, depending upon the particular function of the antibody. For example, for an immunotoxin (toxin associated with an antibody), the act of binding of the antibody to the target can be useful; however, in some embodiments, it is the internalization of the toxin into the cell that is the desired end result. As such, antibodies with a high percent internalization can be desirable in these situations. Thus, in one embodiment, antibodies with a high efficiency in internalization are contemplated. A high efficiency of internalization can be measured as a percent internalized antibody, and can be from a low value to 100%. For example, in varying embodiments, 0.1-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-45, 45-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, 90-99, and 99-100% can be a high efficiency. As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the desirable efficiency can be different in different embodiments, depending upon, for example, the associated agent, the amount of antibody that can be administered to an area, the side effects of the antibody-agent complex, the type (e.g., cancer type) and severity of the problem to be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the antibodies disclosed herein provide an assay kit for the detection of IGF-I/II expression in mammalian tissues or cells in order to screen for a disease or disorder associated with changes in expression of IGF-I/II. The kit comprises an antibody that binds IGF-I/II and means for indicating the reaction of the antibody with the antigen, if present.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an article of manufacture is provided comprising a container, comprising a composition containing an anti-IGF-I/II antibody, and a package insert or label indicating that the composition can be used to treat disease mediated by IGF-I/II expression. Preferably a mammal, and more preferably, a human, receives the anti-IGF-I/II antibody.\n\n\n \nCombinations\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-IGF-I/II antibodies defined hereinbefore may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve, in addition to the compound of the invention, conventional surgery or radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

(Minneapolis, Minn. Cat. No. 291-G1 and 292-G2 respectively) were used as antigens. Monoclonal antibodies against IGF-I/II were developed by sequentially immunizing XenoMouse® mice (XenoMouse strains XMG2 and XMG4 (3C-1 strain), Abgenix, Inc. Fremont, Calif.). XenoMouse animals were immunized via footpad route for all injections. The total volume of each injection was 50 μl per mouse, 25 μl per footpad. A total of ten (10) mice were immunized in each group. Each injection was with 10 μg per mouse of IGF-I or IGF-II alone or conjugated to Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) antigen as a carrier, as detailed in Table 2. The first injection was made up in Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) and admixed 1:1 v/v with Titermax Gold Adjuvant (SIGMA Cat. #T2684, lot #K1599). A total of 8 to 11 additional boosts were then administered over a period of 27 to 38 days, admixed with 25 μg of Adju-Phos (aluminum phosphate gel, Catalog #1452-250, batch #8937, HCl Biosector) and 10 μg CpG (15 μl of ImmunEasy Mouse Adjuvant, catalog #303101; lot #11553042; Qiagen) per mouse, followed by a final boost of 10 μg of antigen in pyrogen-free DPBS, without adjuvant.

The lymphoid cells were dissociated by grinding in DMEM to release the cells from the tissues and the cells were suspended in DMEM. The cells were counted, and 0.9 ml DMEM per 100 million lymphocytes added to the cell pellet to resuspend the cells gently but completely. Using 100 μl of CD90+ magnetic beads per 100 million cells, the cells were labeled by incubating the cells with the magnetic beads at 4° C. for 15 minutes. The magnetically labeled cell suspension containing up to 10\n8 \npositive cells (or up to 2×10\n9 \ntotal cells) was loaded onto a LS+ column and the column washed with DMEM. The total effluent was collected as the CD90-negative fraction (most of these cells were expected to be B cells).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe fusion was performed by mixing washed enriched B cells from above and nonsecretory myeloma P3X63Ag8.653 cells purchased from ATCC, cat.# CRL 1580 (Kearney et al, J. Immunol. 123, 1979, 1548-1550) at a ratio of 1:1. The cell mixture was gently pelleted by centrifugation at 800×g. After complete removal of the supernatant, the cells were treated with 2-4 mL of Pronase solution (CalBiochem, cat. # 53702; 0.5 mg/ml in PBS) for no more than 2 minutes. Then 3-5 ml of FBS was added to stop the enzyme activity and the suspension was adjusted to 40 ml total volume using electro cell fusion solution, (ECFS, 0.3M Sucrose, Sigma, Cat# S7903, 0.1 mM Magnesium Acetate, Sigma, Cat# M2545, 0.1 mM Calcium Acetate, Sigma, Cat# C4705). The supernatant was removed after centrifugation and the cells were resuspended in 40 ml ECFS. This wash step was repeated and the cells again were resuspended in ECFS to a concentration of 2×10\n6 \ncells/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElectro-cell fusion was performed using a fusion generator (model ECM2001, Genetronic, Inc., San Diego, Calif.). The fusion chamber size used was 2.0 ml, using the following instrument settings:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlignment condition: voltage: 50 V, time: 50 sec.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMembrane breaking at: voltage: 3000 V, time: 30 μsec\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPost-fusion holding time: 3 sec\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter ECF, the cell suspensions were carefully removed from the fusion chamber under sterile conditions and transferred into a sterile tube containing the same volume of Hybridoma Culture Medium (DMEM, JRH Biosciences), 15% FBS (Hyclone), supplemented with L-glutamine, pen/strep, OPI (oxaloacetate, pyruvate, bovine insulin) (all from Sigma) and IL-6 (Boehringer Mannheim). The cells were incubated for 15-30 minutes at 37° C., and then centrifuged at 400×g (1000 rpm) for five minutes. The cells were gently resuspended in a small volume of Hybridoma Selection Medium (Hybridoma Culture Medium supplemented with 0.5×HA (Sigma, cat. # A9666)), and the volume adjusted appropriately with more Hybridoma Selection Medium, based on a final plating of 5×10\n6 \nB cells total per 96-well plate and 200 μl per well. The cells were mixed gently and pipetted into 96-well plates and allowed to grow. On \n \nday\n \n 7 or 10, one-half the medium was removed, and the cells re-fed with Hybridoma Selection Medium.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nSelection of Candidate Antibodies by ELISA\n\n\n \n \n \nAfter 14 days of culture, hybridoma supernatants were screened for IGF-I/II-specific monoclonal antibodies. The ELISA plates (Fisher, Cat. No. 12-565-136) were coated with 50 μl/well of human IGF-I or IGF-II (2 μg/ml) in Coating Buffer (0.1 M Carbonate Buffer, pH 9.6, NaHCO\n3 \n8.4 g/L), then incubated at 4° C. overnight. After incubation, the plates were washed with Washing Buffer (0.05\n% Tween\n 20 in PBS) 3 times. 200 μl/well Blocking Buffer (0.5% BSA, 0.1\n% Tween\n 20, 0.01% Thimerosal in 1×PBS) were added and the plates incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After incubation, the plates were washed with Washing Buffer three times. 50 μl/well of hybridoma supernatants, and positive and negative controls were added and the plates incubated at room temperature for 2 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter incubation, the plates were washed three times with Washing Buffer. 100 μl/well of detection antibody goat anti-huIgGFc-HRP (Caltag, Cat. No. H10507), was added and the plates incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. In a secondary screen, the positives in first screening were screened in two sets, one for human IgG (heavy chain) detection and the other for human Ig kappa light chain detection (goat anti-hIg kappa-HRP (Southern Biotechnology, Cat. No. 2060-05) in order to demonstrate fully human composition for both IgG and Ig kappa. After incubation, the plates were washed three times with Washing Buffer. 100 μl/well of TMB (BioFX Lab. Cat. No. TMSK-0100-01) were added and the plates allowed to develop for about 10 minutes (until negative control wells barely started to show color). 50 μl/well stop solution (TMB Stop Solution, (BioFX Lab. Cat. No. STPR-0100-01) was then added and the plates read on an ELISA plate reader at 450 nm. As indicated in Table 3, there were a total of 1,233 wells containing antibodies against IGF-I and -II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll antibodies that bound in the ELISA assay were counter screened for binding to insulin by ELISA in order to exclude those that cross-reacted with insulin. The ELISA plates (Fisher, Cat.

A total of 683 hybridoma lines were identified that have cross-reactivity with mouse IGF-I/II. Accordingly, these hybridoma lines expressed antibodies that bound to human IGF-I, human IGF-II, mouse IGF-I and mouse IGF-II, but did not bind to human insulin.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nInhibition of IGF-I and IGF-II Binding to IGF-IR\n\n\n \n \n \nThe purpose of this study was to screen the 683 anti-IGF-I/II human IgG2 and IgG4 antibodies at the hybridoma supernatant stage for neutralizing activity, as determined by inhibition of IGF-I and IGF-II binding to the IGF-IR receptor. Thus, a receptor/ligand binding assay was performed with NIH3T3 cells that overexpress the human IGF-IR receptor, as described below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBriefly, multi-screen filter plates (MultiScreen 0.65 μM 96-well PVDF, Millipore, Cat. No. MADV NOB 10) were blocked with blocking buffer (PBS containing 10% BSA with 0.02% NaN\n3\n) at 2004/well overnight at 4° C. [\n125\nI]-labeled IGF (Amersham Life Sciences Cat No. IM172 (IGF-I) or IM238 (IGF-II)) at 100 μCi/ml and 50 nM was diluted to the appropriate concentration (70 μM final for IGF-I and 200 μM final for IGF-II) in binding buffer (PBS containing 2% BSA with 0.02% NaN\n3\n). The blocking buffer-coated filter plate was washed once with 200 μL PBS, and 50 μL anti-IGF-I/II Ab supernatants (diluted in binding buffer to 25% final volume) were preincubated with 25 μL of [\n125\nI]-IGF in the MultiScreen plate for 30-60 minutes on ice. Subconfluent NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing hIGF-IR (obtained from AstraZeneca) were harvested with trypsin and resuspended in cold binding buffer at 6×10\n6\n/ml, and 25 μL of cells were added to the plate for a two-hour incubation on ice. The plate was washed four times with 2004 cold PBS and dried overnight. Twenty-five μL/well of scintillant (SuperMix cocktail, Wallac/Perkin Elmer Cat No. 1200-439) was added and the plates were read using a Microbeta, Trilux reader (Wallac).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following controls were used per screening plate: no antibody (total IGF bound), control neutralizing anti-IGF-I (#05-172, Upstate) or anti-IGF-II (#MAB292, R&D Systems) mAbs at 50 μg/ml (non-specific background) and 0.075 to 0.5 μg/ml (approximate EC50 values of the neutralizing antibodies), and isotype-matched control human IgG2 (PK16.3.1, Abgenix, lot #360-154) or IgG4 (108.2.1, Abgenix, lot#718-53A) mAbs at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml (approximate EC50 value of neutralizing antibodies). An additional titration of control neutralizing antibodies and isotype-matched control human antibodies was added to one plate per screening assay (1/10 serial dilution from 50 ug/ml (333.3 nM)). All controls with or without antibodies were prepared in binding buffer supplemented with anti-KLH human IgG2 or IgG4 exhaust supernatant at 25% final volume.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe percentage of inhibition was determined as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n% Inhibition=([(Mean CPM Total \n125\nI-IGF bound)−(Mean CPM \n125\nI-IGF bound in the presence of antibody)]/[(Mean CPM Total \n125\nI-IGF bound)−(Mean CPM \n125\nI-IGF bound in the presence of an excess of control neutralizing antibody*)])×100\n\n \n \n \n \n \nthe non-specific background was determined as CPM of cells with an excess of control neutralizing anti-IGF Ab (50 ug/ml, 333.3 nM), which was found to be equivalent to an excess of cold IGF (less than or equal to 10% of total CPM)\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-IGF-I/II supernatant screening was split by isotype because of radiolabeled ligand availability issues. As shown in Table 4, supernatants from the anti-IGF-I/II antibodies with an IgG2 isotype (293 total) were first screened against radiolabeled IGF-I. A cut-off. at 40% inhibition was initially applied to this screening (i.e. hybridoma lines inhibiting at 40% and above were selected), and 111 hits were selected for subsequent screening against IGF-II. Of the 111 hits, a total of 91 lines were found to inhibit IGF-II binding to its receptor with a 50% cut-off.

In the HA quantitation assay, the high antigen concentration and overnight incubation limit the effect of antibody affinity, allowing for quantitation of the relative amount of antigen-specific antibody present in each sample. The low antigen concentration in the LA assay limits the effect of antibody concentration and results in a ranking of antibodies based on their relative affinity.\n\n\n \nHigh Antigen Quantitation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nELISA plates were coated with relatively large amounts of either IGF-I or IGF-II antigen (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn. Cat. No. 291-G1 and 292-G2 respectively) at 500 ng/ml (67 nM). Antibody-containing hybridoma supernatants were titrated over a dilution range of 1:50 to 1:12200. A control of a known IGF-specific antibody (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn. Cat. No. MAB291 and MAB292 respectively) was used to define the linear range of the assay. Data within the linear range were then used to derive the relative concentration of the IGF-specific antibody in each titrated sample.\n\n\n \nLimited Antigen Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nMicrotiter plates were coated with low concentrations of antigen. Fifty microliters (50 μL) of IGF-I or IGF-II at 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, and 2 ng/ml (covering a range of 8.5 nM to 0.26 nM) in 1% skim milk/1×PBS pH 7.4/0.5% azide was added to each well. The plate was incubated for 30 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlates were washed four times (4×) with water, and 50 μL of hybridoma supernatant containing test antibodies diluted 1:25 in 1% skim milk/1×PBS pH 7.4/0.5% azide were added to the wells. Plates were wrapped tightly with plastic wrap or paraffin film, and incubated overnight with shaking at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the following day, all plates were washed five times (5×) and 50 μL goat anti-Human IgG Fc HRP polyclonal antibody at a concentration of 0.5 ug/ml in 1% milk, 1×PBS pH 7.4 was added to each well. The plates were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlates were washed at least five times (5× with tap water). Fifty microliters (50) μL of HPR substrate TMB was added to each well, and the plate were incubated for 30 minutes. The HRP-TMB reaction was stopped by adding 50 μL of 1 M phosphoric acid to each well. Optical density (absorbance) at 450 nm was measured for each well of the plate.\n\n\n \nData Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nOD values of test antibodies were averaged and the range was calculated. Antibodies with the highest signal and acceptably low standard deviation were selected as antibodies having a higher affinity for the antigen than did a reference antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn analysis was then made to select top antibodies based on either neutralization (Example 4), potency (low antibody concentration as determined by HA ELISA and high inhibition of ligand binding), affinity (LA ELISA), or all three criteria. From this analysis, a list of 25 antibodies was generated. A separate analysis based on average % inhibition of IGF-I and -II binding and affinity for both IGF-I and IGF-II generated a second list of 25 antibodies. Sixteen antibodies were common to both lists, resulting in a final list of 40 antibodies. The LA and HA results for these 40 antibodies are summarized in Table 5. These 40 lines were selected for cloning, of which 33 were successfully cloned.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRESULTS OF HIGH AND LIMITED ANTIGEN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nELISA FOR TOP\n 40 ANTIBODIES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIGF1 HA\n\n\nIGF2 HA\n\n\nIGF1\n\n\nIGF2\n\n\nIGF1\n\n\nIGF2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAvg\n\n\nStd.\n\n\nAvg\n\n\nStd.\n\n\nLA\n\n\nLA\n\n\nLA\n\n\nLA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine\n\n\n(ug/ml)\n\n\nDev\n\n\n(ug/ml)\n\n\nDev\n\n\nIGF1\n\n\nIGF2\n\n\nIGF1\n\n\nIGF2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\n\n\nHA1\n\n\nHA1\n\n\nHA2\n\n\nHA2\n\n\n2 ng/ml\n\n\n2 ng/ml\n\n\n4 ng/ml\n\n\n4 ng/ml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.121\n\n\n1.16\n\n\n0.16\n\n\n3.56\n\n\n1.34\n\n\n0.56\n\n\n0.53\n\n\n1.14\n\n\n0.90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.141\n\n\n1.99\n\n\n0.22\n\n\n1.99\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n0.57\n\n\n0.79\n\n\n1.25\n\n\n1.52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.142\n\n\n4.70\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n3.65\n\n\n0.31\n\n\n0.78\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n1.76\n\n\n1.78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.143\n\n\n1.74\n\n\n0.17\n\n\n2.03\n\n\n0.41\n\n\n0.60\n\n\n0.99\n\n\n1.20\n\n\n1.91\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.25\n\n\n1.26\n\n\n0.23\n\n\n1.48\n\n\n0.36\n\n\n0.71\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n1.31\n\n\n1.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.69\n\n\n7.17\n\n\n1.16\n\n\n6.50\n\n\n0.53\n\n\n0.80\n\n\n0.80\n\n\n1.50\n\n\n1.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.90\n\n\n1.15\n\n\n0.12\n\n\n3.68\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n0.58\n\n\n0.48\n\n\n1.04\n\n\n0.89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.118\n\n\n10.34\n\n\n1.26\n\n\n10.32\n\n\n1.90\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n0.85\n\n\n1.56\n\n\n1.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.123\n\n\n13.4\n\n\n3.2\n\n\n12.0\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n1.66\n\n\n2.58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.127\n\n\n7.28\n\n\n0.44\n\n\n6.59\n\n\n1.55\n\n\n1.19\n\n\n1.37\n\n\n2.29\n\n\n2.40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.130\n\n\n4.32\n\n\n0.32\n\n\n3.51\n\n\n1.34\n\n\n0.64\n\n\n1.17\n\n\n1.36\n\n\n1.98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.146\n\n\n12.04\n\n\n0.98\n\n\n9.63\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.86\n\n\n0.29\n\n\n1.58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.158\n\n\n9.29\n\n\n0.49\n\n\n7.1\n\n\n0.56\n\n\n1.71\n\n\n1.42\n\n\n3.00\n\n\n2.46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.159\n\n\n16.53\n\n\n1.83\n\n\n41.1\n\n\n \n\n\n0.56\n\n\n1.65\n\n\n0.98\n\n\n2.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.160\n\n\n4.9\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n5.1\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n3.14\n\n\n3.30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.175\n\n\n8.46\n\n\n0.49\n\n\n6.21\n\n\n1.22\n\n\n0.13\n\n\n0.34\n\n\n0.14\n\n\n0.62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.202\n\n\n11.94\n\n\n1.98\n\n\n15.24\n\n\n1.72\n\n\n1.11\n\n\n1.68\n\n\n2.28\n\n\n2.69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.212\n\n\n11.30\n\n\n1.90\n\n\n10.86\n\n\n1.26\n\n\n0.97\n\n\n0.93\n\n\n2.22\n\n\n1.54\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.215\n\n\n10.11\n\n\n2.05\n\n\n10.94\n\n\n1.39\n\n\n1.01\n\n\n1.09\n\n\n2.25\n\n\n1.93\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.23\n\n\n4.30\n\n\n0.26\n\n\n3.99\n\n\n0.29\n\n\n0.55\n\n\n1.22\n\n\n1.40\n\n\n2.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.234\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n1.79\n\n\n2.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.251\n\n\n3\n\n\n0.41\n\n\n1.93\n\n\n0.17\n\n\n1.09\n\n\n1.02\n\n\n1.31\n\n\n1.53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.252\n\n\n8.25\n\n\n0.51\n\n\n5.55\n\n\n1.68\n\n\n1.22\n\n\n1.23\n\n\n2.53\n\n\n2.09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.268\n\n\n7.58\n\n\n0.42\n\n\n5.07\n\n\n0.92\n\n\n1.47\n\n\n1.37\n\n\n3.06\n\n\n2.42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.29\n\n\n12.5\n\n\n1.24\n\n\n23.53\n\n\n4.7\n\n\n0.18\n\n\n0.39\n\n\n0.27\n\n\n0.49\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n13.18\n\n\n2.12\n\n\n8.83\n\n\n0.58\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n1.28\n\n\n2.07\n\n\n1.96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.34\n\n\n12.54\n\n\n1.99\n\n\n14.67\n\n\n3.05\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n1.07\n\n\n0.44\n\n\n1.84\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.41\n\n\n3.69\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n4.97\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n1.02\n\n\n1.53\n\n\n2.21\n\n\n2.32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.56\n\n\n14.6\n\n\n2.0\n\n\n21.7\n\n\n3.7\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n2.38\n\n\n2.46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.58\n\n\n17.52\n\n\n0.01\n\n\n27.54\n\n\n6.22\n\n\n0.21\n\n\n1.15\n\n\n0.47\n\n\n1.82\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.66\n\n\n6.02\n\n\n0.81\n\n\n6.18\n\n\n0.71\n\n\n0.49\n\n\n0.97\n\n\n1.42\n\n\n1.53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.77\n\n\n8.42\n\n\n0.18\n\n\n7.25\n\n\n1.12\n\n\n0.64\n\n\n0.46\n\n\n1.50\n\n\n1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.85\n\n\n22.67\n\n\n0.68\n\n\n23.63\n\n\n0.93\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.33\n\n\n0.16\n\n\n0.51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.99\n\n\n7.9\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n5.9\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n1.87\n\n\n1.65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.119\n\n\n1.26\n\n\n0.00\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n0.16\n\n\n2.37\n\n\n0.79\n\n\n3.77\n\n\n1.36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.141\n\n\n5.96\n\n\n0.50\n\n\n4.12\n\n\n0.61\n\n\n1.80\n\n\n0.61\n\n\n3.02\n\n\n1.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.146\n\n\n4.03\n\n\n0.45\n\n\n2.55\n\n\n0.74\n\n\n0.97\n\n\n1.06\n\n\n2.13\n\n\n1.98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.287\n\n\n4.8\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n2.2\n\n\n1.6\n\n\n3.80\n\n\n2.91\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.8\n\n\n2.00\n\n\n0.17\n\n\n1.45\n\n\n0.25\n\n\n1.72\n\n\n0.77\n\n\n3.13\n\n\n1.46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.86\n\n\n3.15\n\n\n0.19\n\n\n2.36\n\n\n0.24\n\n\n0.92\n\n\n1.35\n\n\n1.76\n\n\n2.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nBinding of Antibodies to IGF-I and IGF-II Bound to IGFBP-3\n\n\n \n \n \nIGF-I and -II circulate in serum mostly bound to IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs). One aim was to identify antibodies that do not recognize IGFs in complex with IGFBPs, in order to avoid in vivo depletion of anti-IGF antibodies. The following assay format was developed for the characterization of antibodies that recognize IGF-I or IGF-II when these growth factors are complexed with IGFBP-3. Specifically, this assay tested the ability of IGF in IGF/anti-IGF antibody complexes to bind IGFBP-3.\n\n\n \nAntibody-Mediated Block of Capture of IGF by IGFBP-3\n\n\n \n \n \nAn assay was developed wherein complexes were pre-formed between IGF-1 or IGF-II and IGF-specific antibodies from the aforementioned examples. The ability of these complexes to bind to IGFBP-3 was tested using AlphaScreen assay technology (PerkinElmer). In a 384-well plate, 10 μL 1:20 diluted hybridoma supernatants were mixed with 10 μL of 3 nM biotinylated IGF-I or IGF-II and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. Streptavidin-coated AlphaScreen donor beads and IGFBP-3-coupled AlphaScreen acceptor beads (10 uL of a mixture, for a 1/60 final dilution of the hybridoma supernatants) were added, and the incubation was continued for another hour. Samples were then read in a Packard Fusion plate reader.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThree commercially available anti-IGF monoclonal antibodies M23 (Cell Sciences), 05-172 (Upstate) and MAB291 (R&D Systems) showed different abilities to inhibit IGF binding to IGFBP with IC50 values ranging from low ng/mL to 100 ng/mL. No inhibition of IGF-I binding to the IGFBP-3 was observed with irrelevant mouse IgG and human IgG up to 10 μg/mL, suggesting that the anti-IGF-I effect is specific. Commercially available monoclonal antibodies 05-166 (Upstate) and MAB292 (R&D) showed a significant difference in affinity for inhibition of IGF-II/IGFBP-3 interactions. These experiments show that anti-IGF mAbs can block the binding of IGF to IGFBP-3, giving an assay that could be used for screening purified antibodies from hybridoma lines. The next step was to evaluate the effects of exhausted hybridoma medium on the assay signal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerial dilutions of the hybridoma medium and anti-KLH hybridoma exhaust supernatants were tested in the assay system. When hybridoma supernatants were diluted 1:10 in preparation for preincubation with IGFI/II (final dilution in the assay was 1:60), there was almost no effect of the medium on the assay results. Based on these data, hybridoma supernatants were diluted for preincubation with IGF, providing the preferred 1/60 dilution final dilution in the assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSix hundred eighty-three exhaust supernatants positive for IGF-I and IGF-II binding were examined for their ability to inhibit binding of IGF to IGFBP-3. Inhibition above 50% for IGF-I and above 60% for IGF-II were used as cut-off criteria. The summary results of the screen using these cut-offs are shown in Table 6.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNUMBERS OF POSITIVE HITS IDENTIFIED IN THE SCREEN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIGF-I\n\n\nIGF-II\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nInhibition\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSamples\n\n\n>50%\n\n\n>60%\n\n\nIGF-I/II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n376\n\n\n(plates 1-4)\n\n\n48\n\n\n51\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n307\n\n\n(plates 5-8)\n\n\n39\n\n\n78\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n683\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n87\n\n\n129\n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IGFBP competition assay using the AlphaScreen assay identified 87 samples inhibiting IGF-I binding to IGFBP-3 and 129 samples inhibiting IGF-II binding to IGFBP-3 among 683 tested supernatants. Fifty-one samples demonstrated dual competition of IGF-1 and IGF-11. However, in order to more carefully reproduce the function or behavior of the antibodies in vivo, where the IGF and the IGFBP complex would be largely preformed, additional assays, as described in example 8 were performed.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nDetermination of ANTI-IGF-I and IGF-II Antibody Affinity using Biacore Analysis (Low Resolution Screen)\n\n\nLow Resolution Screen of 34 Purified Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe label-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR), or Biacore, was utilized to measure the antibody affinity to the antigen. For this purpose, a high-density goat anti-human antibody surface over a CM5 Biacore chip was prepared using routine amine coupling. All the mAbs were diluted to approximately 20 μg/ml in HBS-P running buffer containing 100 μg/ml BSA. Each mAb was captured on a separate surface using a 30-second contact time at 10 μL/min., and a 5-minute wash for stabilization of the mAb baseline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIGF-I was injected at 335.3 nM over all surfaces at 23° C. for 120 seconds, followed by a 5-minute dissociation, using a flow rate of 100 μL/min. The samples were prepared in the HBS-P running buffer described above. The surfaces were regenerated after every capture/injection cycle with one 15-second pulse of 146 mM phosphoric acid (pH 1.5). The same capture/injection cycles were repeated for each antibody with 114.7 nM IGF-II. Drift-corrected binding data for the 34 mAbs was prepared by subtracting the signal from a control flow cell and subtracting the baseline drift of a buffer injected just prior to each antigen injection. Data were fit globally to a 1:1 interaction model using CLAMP to determine the binding kinetics (David G. Myszka and Thomas Morton (1998) “CLAMP©: a biosensor kinetic data analysis program,” TIES 23, 149-150). A mass transport coefficient was used in fitting the data. The kinetic analysis results of IGF-I and IGF-H binding at 25° C. are listed in Table 7 below. The mAbs are ranked from highest to lowest affinity.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIGF-I AND IGF-II LOW RESOLUTION BIACORE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSCREEN OF 34 MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIGF-II\n\n\nIGF-I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample\n\n\nk\na \n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)\n\n\nk\nd \n(s\n−1\n)\n\n\nK\nD \n(pM)\n\n\nk\na \n(M\n−1\ns\n−1\n)\n\n\nk\nd \n(s\n−1\n)\n\n\nK\nD \n(pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.159.2\n\n\n3.5 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.0 × 10\n−5 \n*\n\n\n2.9\n\n\n4.3 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n9.3 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n216.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.86.1\n\n\n6.1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.4 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n39.3\n\n\n3.4 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.3 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n3823.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.25.1\n\n\n9.3 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n4.1 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n44.1\n\n\n5.1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n6.9 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n1353.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.234.2\n\n\n6.4 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.9 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n45.3\n\n\n6.7 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.2 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n328.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.160.2\n\n\n4.6 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.5 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n54.3\n\n\n5.6 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n3.3 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n589.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.146.3\n\n\n3.2 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.8 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n56.2\n\n\n3.8 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n8.7 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n2289.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.34.1\n\n\n3.0 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.8 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n60.0\n\n\n5.2 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n3.2 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n615.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.123.1\n\n\n4.0 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n3.4 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n85.0\n\n\n4.3 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n9.0 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n2093.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.202.3\n\n\n1.8 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.7 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n94.4\n\n\n1.2 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n5.4 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n4500.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.141.1\n\n\n4.9 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n4.7 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n95.9\n\n\n*\n\n\n*\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.215.2\n\n\n3.2 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n3.3 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n103.0\n\n\n3.6 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.6 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n7222.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.287.2\n\n\n2.4 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.5 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n104.0\n\n\n7.7 × 10\n5\n \n\n\n1.3 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n1688.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.146.2\n\n\n7.7 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n8.0 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n104.0\n\n\n2.4 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.3 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n5417.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.143.2\n\n\n1.1 × 10\n7\n \n\n\n1.2 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n109.0\n\n\n6.4 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.9 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n2969.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.251.3\n\n\n3.5 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n4.3 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n123.0\n\n\n4.6 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n4.3 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n935.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.99.1\n\n\n6.9 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n9.9 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n143.0\n\n\n6.0 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n4.8 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n800.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.142.2\n\n\n5.3 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n8.5 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n160.0\n\n\n8.5 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.9 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n2235.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.41.3\n\n\n3.2 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n5.5 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n172.0\n\n\n5.2 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.9 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n558.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.56.3\n\n\n3.3 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n6.0 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n182.0\n\n\n4.8 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n3.1 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n646.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.127.1\n\n\n4.1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n7.6 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n185.0\n\n\n4.9 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n3.5 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n714.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.8.3\n\n\n4.0 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n7.8 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n195.0\n\n\n3.1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n8.2 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n264.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.158.2\n\n\n3.4 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n6.7 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n197.0\n\n\n4.4 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.2 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n500.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.23.3\n\n\n3.3 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n6.5 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n197.0\n\n\n4.1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n5.8 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n1415.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.252.1\n\n\n3.2 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n6.5 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n203.0\n\n\n2.3 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.1 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n913.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.66.1\n\n\n3.6 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n7.7 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n214.0\n\n\n2.0 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.5 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n1250.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.130.1\n\n\n4.2 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.0 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n238.0\n\n\n4.6 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.8 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n3913.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.90.2\n\n\n4.9 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.2 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n245.0\n\n\n*\n\n\n*\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.3\n\n\n3.2 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n8.8 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n275.0\n\n\n4.1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n3.9 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n951.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.118.1\n\n\n4.6 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.5 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n326.0\n\n\n5.6 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n5.1 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n911.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.212.1\n\n\n4.2 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.6 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n381.0\n\n\n3.1 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n6.0 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n1935.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.175.2\n\n\n1.3 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n7.4 × 10\n−4\n \n\n\n569.0\n\n\n1.8 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.0 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n11111.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.121.1\n\n\n5.5 × 10\n6 \n*\n\n\n3.2 × 10\n−3 \n*\n\n\n582.0 *\n\n\n1.5 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.1 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n1400.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.85.2\n\n\n1.9 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n1.3 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n684.0\n\n\n2.2 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n2.9 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n13182.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.58.3\n\n\n8.9 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n7.9 × 10\n−3\n \n\n\n888.0\n\n\n7.2 × 10\n6\n \n\n\n3.2 × 10\n−2\n \n\n\n4444.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIGF-I Binding Data\n\n\n \n \n \nMost mAbs fit a 1:1 model reasonably well.

For example, the antibody can bind to IGF-II with 2.5 times greater affinity than to IGF-I. In certain embodiments, the antibody can bind to IGF-II with at least 5, at least 10, at least 25, at least 50 or at least 150 times greater affinity than to IGF-I.\n\n\n \nScreening of Preformed IGF-I/GFBP-3 Complexes\n\n\n \n \n \nThe IGFBP competition assay described in Example 6 identified 87 samples inhibiting IGF-I binding to IGFBP-3 and 129 samples inhibiting IGF-II binding to IGFBP-3 among 683 tested supernatants. Fifty-one samples demonstrated dual competition of IGF-I and IGF-II. However, in order to more carefully reproduce the function or behavior of the antibodies in vivo, where the IGF and the IGFBP complex would be largely preformed, the following Biacore assays were performed on selected antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSix selected antibodies were screened to determine whether they bind IGF-I or IGF-II in complex with IGFBP. All six of the selected mAbs (7.159.2, 7.146.3, 7.34.1, 7.251.3, 7.58.3, and unrelated control antibody ABX-MA1) were covalently immobilized to a high surface capacity (5,400-12,800 RUs) on two CM5 Biacore chips using routine amine coupling with a \nBiacore\n 2000 instrument. One flow cell on each CM5 chip was activated and blocked (no mAb immobilized) for use as a control surface.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNext, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were mixed together in Hepes buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.005% P-20, 100 μg/ml BSA (HBS-P), to make a final solution of 193 nM and 454 nM, respectively. IGF-II and IGFBP-3 were mixed together to make a final solution of 192 nM and 455 nM, respectively. Under these conditions, IGF-I and IGF-II were 99.97% complexed by IGFBP-3. Equilibrium was reached within minutes under these conditions. Solutions of complexed IGF-I/IGFBP-3 and IGF-II/IGFBP-3 were flowed across the various mAb surfaces at 40 μL/min and 23° C., for 180 seconds and dissociation was followed for 120 seconds. Uncomplexed IGF-I and IGF-II were then flowed across each surface at 193 nM and 192 nM, respectively, and IGFBP-3 was flowed across each surface at 454 nM. The surfaces were regenerated with a 20 second pulse of 10 mM glycine, pH 2.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sensorgrams were processed using the program Scrubber by subtracting the bulk refractive index change and any nonspecific binding signal of the analyte to the blank surface from the binding signal from surfaces with mAb immobilized. After blank correction subtraction, the sensorgrams were referenced a second time by subtracting an average sensorgram for buffer injections over a specific flow cell. This “double reference” corrected the mAb binding sensorgrams for any systematic errors present on a particular flow cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nComplexed and uncomplexed IGF-I/IGFBP-3 and IGF-II/IGFBP-3 bound fairly weakly to the bound antibodies, with a rough estimate of the nonspecific binding interaction being a K\nD\n>1 μM for all six mAbs, including negative control ABX-MA1 (See Table 9). However, with ABX-MA1 the IGF-I/II binding was weak and indicated nonspecific binding interactions occurred with all these three analytes. Apparently, the IGF/IGFBP-3 complexes bind slightly stronger to all these mAbs than IGFBP-3 does alone. However, because both IGF-I, and IGBP-3 appear to bind nonspecifically to these mAbs themselves, when they are both bound together, this results in an even “stickier” nonspecific binding protein complex, which explains the greater binding signal for the complex. The IGF-I/II/IGFBP-3 complexes and IGFBP-3 bound to the control surface significantly also indicating the nonspecificity of these two proteins. However, in the sensorgrams below this background binding is subtracted out in the first reference during data processing, as described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis experiment suggests that although 51 of the samples were previously shown to inhibit binding of IGF-I/II to IGFBP3 (Example 6), the antibodies may also bind to the IGF/IGFBP complex in vitro.*\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBINDING SUMMARY FOR IGF-I/IGFBP-3 AND\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIGF-II/IGFBP-3 BINDING TO SIX MABS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIGF-I/IGFBP-3\n\n\nIGF-II/IGFBP-3\n\n\n \n\n\nIGF-I\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmAb\n\n\ncomplex\n\n\ncomplex\n\n\nIGFBP-3\n\n\n(or II)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.159.2\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.146.3\n\n\n+\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.34.1\n\n\n+\n\n\n++\n\n\n+\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.251.3\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.58.3\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n++\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABX-MA1\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n+, slight binding relative to IGF-I or IGF-II to the mAb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n++, medium binding relative to IGF-I or IGF-II to the mAb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n+++, strong binding relative to IGF-I or IGF-II binding to the mAb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*These ratings DO NOT indicate the K\nD \nfor these interactions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nDetermination of Anti-Insulin Antibody Affinity using Biacore Analysis\n\n\nLow Resolution Screen\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cross-reactivity of antibodies to was further investigated by measuring the affinity of the mAbs to human insulin. IGF-I/II antibodies were immobilized to the CM5 Biacore chips, and insulin in solution was injected for the determination of the on-rate and off-rate. Five mAbs, including 7.234.2, 7.34.1, 7.159.2, 7.160.2, and 7.251.3, were tested in this experiment. Insulin diluted to 502 nM in the running buffer was injected over all capture surfaces.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNo insulin binding to any of the mAbs was observed at 502 nM insulin. These results suggest that there is no apparent cross-reactivity of the IGF-I/II mAbs with insulin.\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nBinning of Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nEpitope binning was performed to determine which of the anti-IGF-I/II antibodies would cross compete with one another, and thus were likely to bind to the same epitope on IGF-I/II. The binning process is described in U.S. Patent Application 20030175760, also described in Jia et al., J. Immunol. Methods, (2004) 288:91-98, both of which are incorporated by reference in entirety. Briefly, Luminex beads were coupled with mouse anti-huIgG (Pharmingen #555784) following the protein coupling protocol provided on the Luminex website. Pre-coupled beads were prepared for coupling to primary unknown antibody using the following procedure, protecting the beads from light. Individual tubes were used for each unknown supernatant. The volume of supernatant needed was calculated using the following formula: (nX2+10)×50 μl (where n=total number of samples). A concentration of 0.1 μg/ml was used in this assay. The bead stock was gently vortexed, and diluted in supernatant to a concentration of 2500 of each bead in 50 μl per well or 0.5×10\n5 \nbeads/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples were incubated on a shaker in the dark at room temperature overnight.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe filter plate was pre-wetted by adding 200 μl wash buffer per well, which was then aspirated. 50 μl of each bead was added to each well of the filter plate. Samples were washed once by adding 100 μl/well wash buffer and aspirating. Antigen and controls were added to the filter plate at 50 μl/well. The plate was covered, incubated in the dark for 1 hour on a shaker, and then samples were washed 3 times. A secondary unknown antibody was then added at 50 μl/well. A concentration of 0.1 μg/ml was used for the primary antibody. The plate was then incubated in the dark for 2 hours at room temperature on a shaker, and then samples were washed 3 times. 50 μl/well of biotinylated mouse anti-human IgG (Pharmingen #555785) diluted at 1:500 was added, and samples were incubated in the dark for 1 hour with shaking at room temperature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSamples were washed 3 times. 50 μl/well Streptavidin-PE at a 1:1000 dilution was added, and samples were incubated in the dark for 15 minutes with shaking at room temperature. After running two wash cycles on the Luminex100, samples were washed 3 times. Contents in each well were resuspended in 80 μl blocking buffer. Samples were carefully mixed with pipetting several times to resuspend the beads. Samples were then analyzed on the Luminex100.

The complete sequence information for the anti-IGF-I/II antibodies is provided in the sequence listing with nucleotide and amino acid sequences for each gamma and kappa chain combination. The variable heavy sequences were analyzed to determine the VH family, the D-region sequence and the J-region sequence. The sequences were then translated to determine the primary amino acid sequence and compared to the germline VH, D and J-region sequences to assess somatic hypermutations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alignment of the sequences of these antibodies to their germline genes are shown in the following tables. Table 11 is a table comparing the antibody heavy chain regions to their cognate germ line heavy chain region. Table 12 is a table comparing the antibody kappa light chain regions to their cognate germ line light chain region. Identity is shown as “-” and mutations away from germline are shown as the new amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe variable (V) regions of immunoglobulin chains are encoded by multiple germ line DNA segments, which are joined into functional variable regions (V\nH\nDJ\nH \nor V\nK\nJ\nK\n) during B-cell ontogeny. The molecular and genetic diversity of the antibody response to IGF-I/II was studied in detail. These assays revealed several points specific to anti-IGF-I/II antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis of five individual antibodies specific to IGF-I/II resulted in the determination that the antibodies were derived from three different germline VII genes, four of them from the VH4 family, with 2 antibodies being derived from the VH4-39 gene segment. Tables 11 and 12 show the results of this analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should be appreciated that amino acid sequences among the sister clones collected from each hybridoma are identical. For example, the heavy chain and light chain sequences for mAb 7.159.2 are identical to the sequences shown in Tables 11 and 12 for mAb 7.159.1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe heavy chain CDR1s of the antibodies of the invention have a sequence as disclosed in Table 11. The CDR1s disclosed in Table 11 are of the Kabat definition. Alternatively, the CDR1s can be defined using an alternative definition so as to include the last five residues of the FR1 sequence. For example, for antibody 7.159.1 the FR1 sequence is QVQLVQSGAEVKKPGASVKVSCKAS (SEQ ID NO.: 93) and the CDR1 sequence is GYTFTSYDIN (SEQ ID NO.: 94); for antibody 7.158.1 the FR1 sequence is QLQLQESGPGLVKPSETLSLTCTVS (SEQ ID NO.: 95) and the CDR1 sequence is GGSIRSSSYYWG (SEQ ID NO.: 96); for antibody 7.234.1 the FR1 sequence is QLQLQESGPGLVKPSETLSLTCTVS (SEQ ID NO.: 97) and the CDR1 sequence is GGSINSSSNYWG (SEQ ID NO.: 98); for antibody 7.34.1 the FR1 sequence is QVQLQESGPGLVKPSETLSLTCTVS (SEQ ID NO.: 99) and the CDR1 sequence is GGSISSYYWS (SEQ ID NO.: 100); and for antibody 7.251.3 the FR1 sequence is QVQLQESGPGLVKPSETLSLTCTVS (SEQ ID NO.: 101) and the CDR1 sequence is GGSISSYYWS (SEQ ID NO.: 102).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt should also be appreciated that where a particular antibody differs from its respective germline sequence at the amino acid level, the antibody sequence can be mutated back to the germline sequence. Such corrective mutations can occur at one, two, three or more positions, or a combination of any of the mutated positions, using standard molecular biological techniques. By way of non-limiting example, Table 12 shows that the light chain sequence of mAb 7.34.1 (SEQ ID NO.: 12) differs from the corresponding germline sequence (SEQ ID NO.:80) through a Pro to Ala mutation (mutation 1) in the FR1 region, and via a Phe to Leu mutation (mutation 2) in the FR2 region. Thus, the amino acid or nucleotide sequence encoding the light chain of mAb 7.34.1 can be modified to change \nmutation\n 1 to yield the germline sequence at the site of \nmutation\n 1. Further, the amino acid or nucleotide sequence encoding the light chain of mAb 7.34.1 can be modified to change \nmutation\n 2 to yield the germline sequence at the site of \nmutation\n 2. Still further, the amino acid or nucleotide sequence encoding the light chain of mAb 7.34.1 can be modified to change both \nmutation\n 1 and \nmutation\n 2 to yield the germline sequence at the sites of both \n \nmutations\n \n 1 and 2.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHEAVY CHAIN ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n

IGF-II-Induced Phosphorylation of hIGF-IR Ectopically Expressed in NIH3T3 Cells\n\n\n \n \n \nIGF ligands exert their proliferation and anti-apoptosis functions by activating receptor tyrosine kinase activity in the IGF-IR receptor. In order to evaluate the anti IGF-I/II antibodies for their ability to inhibit IGF-induced phosphorylation of IGF-IR, NIH3T3 cells ectopically expressing hIGF-IR, were used in the following assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNIH3T3 cells ectopically expressing the human IGF-1R were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 10,000 cells per well and incubated overnight in starvation media (1% charcoal stripped FBS). The following day, the growth medium was discarded, the wells were gently washed twice with PBS, and 100 μL of serum-free medium (0% FBS) was added to starve the cells. After 1-2 hours, 100 ul of serum-free medium with 0.05% BSA containing either IGF-I (10 nM) or IGF-II (10 nM) that was pre-incubated for 60 minutes at 37° C. with various antibody concentrations, was added to the cells in triplicate. The stimulation was allowed to occur for 10 minutes at 37° C., after stimulation, media removed and 100 uL 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS/3% BSA added to each well and incubated at RT for 20 min. The cells were then washed 2× with PBS and 100 uL permeabilization buffer (0.1% Triton-X in 3% BSA/PBS) was added to each well. This was allowed to incubate at RT for 10 min, discarded and 100 ul of 0.6% hydrogen peroxide in PBS/3% BSA was added to inactivate any endogenous peroxidase activity. After a 20 min RT incubation, the cells were washed 3× with PBS/0.1% Tween-20 and blocked by adding 100 \nuL\n 10% FBS in PBS/0.1% Tween-20 at RT for 1 hr. The Blocking Buffer was then removed and 50 uL anti-phospho IGFIR antibody at 1 ug/ml (cat#44-804, BioSource) was added to each well in 10% FBS/PBS-T. After a 2 hr RT incubation cells were washed 3× with PBST soaking for 5 minutes between each wash. After the washes 50u1/well of a Goat anti Rabbit IgGFc-HRP secondary antibody diluted 1:250 in Blocking Buffer was added to each of the well. After a 1 hour RT incubation the cells were washed 3× for 5 minutes with PBST as before and tapped dry. 50 ul of ECL reagent (DuoLux) was then added and RLUs was read immediately.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThirty-two (32) antibody lines were screened, and two independent assays were performed for each antigen.

In order to evaluate the antibodies for their ability to inhibit IGF-induced proliferation, BxPC3 human pancreatic tumor cells, which express endogenous hIGF-IR, were used in the following assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBxPC3 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 2000 cells per well and cultured overnight in regular growth medium. The following day, the growth medium was discarded, the wells were gently washed twice in medium without serum, and 100 μL of serum-free medium with 10 μg/ml transferrin and 0.1% BSA (assay medium) was added to starve the cells. After 24 hours, the medium was discarded, the cells were gently washed once in medium without serum, and 100 μL of assay medium containing 20 ng/ml IGF preincubated for 30 min at 37° C. with various antibody concentrations was added to the cells in duplicate or triplicate. The plates were incubated for 3 days, and proliferation was quantitated using the CellTiter-Glo reagent (Promega).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTen antibody lines were screened, and two or three independent assays were performed for each antigen. The results are summarized in Table 16 below. Based on the functional data below and the data from the Example 14, the four best antibodies were selected. IGF-I-induced proliferation assay data was excluded from the selection criteria because of the high assay variability observed.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF INHIBITION OF IGF-DEPENDENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROLIFERATION OF BxPC3 HUMAN PANCREATIC\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTUMOR CELLS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIGF-II Proliferation Results (n = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nn = 1\n\n\nn = 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMax %\n\n\n \n\n\n*Max %\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nInhibition\n\n\n \n\n\nInhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMAbBD\n\n\n(333.3 nM)\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\n(133.3 nM)\n\n\nEC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.159.2\n\n\n120.0\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n118.3\n\n\n0.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.34.1\n\n\n117.0\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n109.0\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.146.3\n\n\n128.7\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n119.5\n\n\n7.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.251.3\n\n\n128.5\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n105.3\n\n\n4.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.234.2\n\n\n111.7\n\n\nN.D.\n\n\n200.7\n\n\n2.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.160.2\n\n\n79.7\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n155.7\n\n\nN.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.158.2\n\n\n86.3\n\n\n  0.0013\n\n\n148.3\n\n\nN.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.56.3\n\n\n87.0\n\n\nN.D.\n\n\n112.3\n\n\n102.0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.118.1\n\n\n114.0\n\n\n34.0 \n\n\n137.0\n\n\n54.7 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.41.3\n\n\n102.0\n\n\nN.D.\n\n\n73.0\n\n\nND\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*333 nM for the last 3 antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN.D.: Not Determined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nDetermination of Cross-Reactivity with Mouse IGF-I, IGF-II and Insulin\n\n\n \n \n \nOne objective was to develop antibodies that were specific to IGF-I and IGF-II but that have no cross-reactivity with insulin. In order to perform later experiments in animals, the antibodies should also cross-react with murine IGF-I/II but not murine insulin. Accordingly, ELISA assays were performed to determine whether selected antibodies were able to cross-react with murine IGFs or insulin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Table 17, five of the top ten antibodies were tested for cross-reactivity with mouse or rat insulin by ELISA.

This assay was performed as previously described using NIH3T3 cells ectopically expressing the hIGF-IR receptor. The results of this assay are summarized in Table 18.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNIH3T3 cells ectopically expressing the human IGF-IR were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 10,000 cells per well and incubated overnight in starvation media (1% charcoal stripped FBS). The following day, the growth medium was discarded, the wells were gently washed twice with PBS, and 100 μL of serum-free medium (0% FBS) was added to starve the cells. After 1-2 hours, 100 ul of serum-free medium with 0.05% BSA containing either mouse IGF-I (10 nM) or IGF-II (10 nM) (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, Minn. Cat. No. 791-MG and 792-MG respectively) that was pre-incubated for 60 minutes at 37° C. with various antibody concentrations, was added to the cells in triplicate. The stimulation was allowed to occur for 10 minutes at 37° C., after stimulation, media removed and 100 uL 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS/3% BSA added to each well and incubated at RT for 20 min. The cells were then washed 2× with PBS and 100 uL permeabilization buffer (0.1% Triton-X in 3% BSA/PBS) was added to each well. This was allowed to incubate at RT for 10 min, discarded and 100 ul of 0.6% hydrogen peroxide in PBS/3% BSA was added to inactivate any endogenous peroxidase activity. After a 20 min RT incubation, the cells were washed 3× with PBS/0.1% Tween-20 and blocked by adding 100 \nuL\n 10% FBS in PBS/0.1% Tween-20 at RT for 1 hr. The Blocking Buffer was then removed and 50 uL anti-phospho IGFIR antibody at 1 ug/ml (cat#44-804, BioSource) was added to each well in 10% FBS/PBS-T. After a 2 hr RT incubation cells were washed 3× with PBST soaking for 5 minutes between each wash. After the \nwashes\n 50 ul/well of a Goat anti Rabbit IgGFc-HRP secondary antibody diluted 1:250 in Blocking Buffer was added to each of the well. After a 1 hour RT incubation the cells were washed 3× for 5 minutes with PBST as before and tapped dry. 50u1 of ECL reagent (DuoLux) was then added and RLUs was read immediately.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nINHIBITION OF MOUSE IGF-INDUCED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHOSPHORYLATION OF hIGF-IR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMouse IGF-I EC50 (nM)\n\n\nMouse IGF-II EC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmAb ID\n\n\nn = 1\n\n\nn = 2\n\n\nn = 1\n\n\nn = 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.159.2\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n5.7\n\n\n3.1\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.34.1\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n10.2\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n9.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.251.3\n\n\n6.7\n\n\n10.6\n\n\n5.4\n\n\n8.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.234.2\n\n\n46.0\n\n\n \n\n\n36.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.160.2\n\n\n49.5\n\n\n \n\n\n225.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\nInhibition of the Growth of NIH3T3 Cells Expressing IGF-II and IGF-1R In Vivo in Nude Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nIn order to evaluate the antibodies for their ability to inhibit IGF-II-induced proliferation in vivo, the following experiments were performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFemale nude mice 6-8 weeks of age (supplied by Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass., USA) were implanted subcutaneously with 5×10\n6 \n \nClone\n 32 cells (NIH3T3 cells ectopically overexpressing human IGF-II and human IGF-1R). The cells were suspended in PBS in a total inoculum volume of 330 μl. The tumors were allowed to grow to 100-200 mm\n3 \nprior to treatment with monoclonal antibodies 7.159.2, 7.34.1 and 7.251.3. Antibodies or IgG2 isotype control antibody suspended in PBS were administered intraperitoneally to randomized groups of 9 or 12 mice weekly for 4 weeks at 5 or 50 mg/kg from Day 22. PBS was administered as a vehicle control to a further group of 11 mice weekly for 4 weeks from Day 22. Tumor size and body weight was measured 2-3 times per week. The results are summarized in \nFIGS. 1 and 2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSignificant tumor growth inhibition was observed (see \nFIG. 1\n) with no significant weight loss occurring in any group (see \nFIG. 2\n). Antibodies 7.159.2, 7.34.1 and 7.251.3 significantly inhibited the growth of \nClone\n 32 tumors at 5 and 50 mg/kg/week (see \nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\n \nExample 19\n\n\nInhibition of the Growth of NIH3T3 Cells Expressing IGF-I and IGF-1R In Vivo in Nude Mice\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the previous example, the antibodies were shown to inhibit IGF-II-induced proliferation in vivo. In order to evaluate the antibodies for their ability to inhibit IGF-1-induced proliferation in vivo, the following experiments were performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFemale nude mice (Alderley Park strain derived from Swiss nu/nu mice strain, supplied by AstraZeneca) were implanted with 5×10\n6 \nviable P12 cells [NIH3T3 cells ectopically overexpressing human IGF-I and human IGF-1R (Pietrzkowski et al, Cell Growth & Differentiation, 3, 199-205, 1992)] subcutaneously in the left flank. The cells were suspended in PBS in a total inoculum volume of 0.1 ml. Two groups of animals (each n=10) were dosed twice weekly from day of NIH3T3 cell implant with either mAb 7.159.2 at 1.0 mg per mouse or with an equivalent volume of PBS vehicle (0.3 ml) for the same schedule. All doses were given intraperitoneally via the (i.p.) route. Animal body weights were measured daily and, once established, tumor measurements were taken twice weekly using calipers. The volume for all measurable tumors was calculated from the caliper measurements assuming an ovoid shape. The results are summarized in \nFIG. 3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in \nFIG. 3\n, significant tumor growth inhibition was observed with mAb 7.159.2 following twice weekly i.p. administration of 1.0 mg antibody/mouse.

More particularly, the invention pertains to compositions and methods for modulating vascular formation and maintenance mediated by neuropilin-1 (NRP1) receptor. This invention further relates to methods for the screening of substances therapeutically useful for preventing or treating conditions and diseases associated with angiogenesis.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nDevelopment of a vascular system is a fundamental requirement for many physiological and pathological processes. Actively growing tissues such as embryos and tumors require adequate blood supply. They satisfy this need by producing pro-angiogenic factors, which promote new blood vessel formation and maintenance via a process generally referred to as angiogenesis. Vascular formation is a complex but orderly biological event involving all or many of the following steps: a) Endothelial cells (ECs) proliferate from existing ECs or differentiate from progenitor cells; b) ECs migrate and coalesce to form cord-like structures; c) vascular cords then undergo tubulogenesis to form vessels with a central lumen d) existing cords or vessels send out sprouts to form secondary vessels; e) primitive vascular plexus undergo further remodeling and reshaping; and f) peri-endothelial cells are recruited to encase the endothelial tubes, providing maintenance and modulatory functions to the vessels; such cells including pericytes for small capillaries, smooth muscle cells for larger vessels, and myocardial cells in the heart.

A. \nCell. \n112:19-28 (2003).\n\n\nIt is now well established that angiogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders. These include solid tumors and metastasis, atherosclerosis, retrolental fibroplasia, hemangiomas, chronic inflammation, intraocular neovascular diseases such as proliferative retinopathies, e.g., diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), neovascular glaucoma, immune rejection of transplanted corneal tissue and other tissues, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. Folkman et al., J. Biol. Chem., 267:10931-10934 (1992); Klagsbrun et al., Annu. Rev. Physiol. 53:217-239 (1991); and Garner A., “Vascular diseases”, In: Pathobiology of Ocular Disease. A Dynamic Approach, Garner A., Klintworth G K, eds., 2nd Edition (Marcel Dekker, NY, 1994), pp 1625-1710.\n\n\nIn the case of tumor growth, angiogenesis appears to be crucial for the transition from hyperplasia to neoplasia, and for providing nourishment for the growth and metastasis of the tumor. Folkman et al., \nNature \n339:58 (1989). The neovascularization allows the tumor cells to acquire a growth advantage and proliferative autonomy compared to the normal cells. A tumor usually begins as a single aberrant cell which can proliferate only to a size of a few cubic millimeters due to the distance from available capillary beds, and it can stay ‘dormant’ without further growth and dissemination for a long period of time. Some tumor cells then switch to the angiogenic phenotype to activate endothelial cells, which proliferate and mature into new capillary blood vessels. These newly formed blood vessels not only allow for continued growth of the primary tumor, but also for the dissemination and recolonization of metastatic tumor cells. Accordingly, a correlation has been observed between density of microvessels in tumor sections and patient survival in breast cancer as well as in several other tumors. Weidner et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med \n324:1-6 (1991); Horak et al., \nLancet \n340:1120-1124 (1992); Macchiarini et al., \nLancet \n340:145-146 (1992). The precise mechanisms that control the angiogenic switch is not well understood, but it is believed that neovascularization of tumor mass results from the net balance of a multitude of angiogenesis stimulators and inhibitors (Folkman, 1995, \nNat Med \n1(1):27-31).\n\n\nThe process of vascular development is tightly regulated. To date, a significant number of molecules, mostly secreted factors produced by surrounding cells, have been shown to regulate EC differentiation, proliferation, migration and coalescence into cord-like structures. For example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified as the key factor involved in stimulating angiogenesis and in inducing vascular permeability. Ferrara et al., \nEndocr. Rev. \n18:4-25 (1997). The finding that the loss of even a single VEGF allele results in embryonic lethality points to an irreplaceable role played by this factor in the development and differentiation of the vascular system. Furthermore, VEGF has been shown to be a key mediator of neovascularization associated with tumors and intraocular disorders. Ferrara et al., \nEndocr. Rev\n. supra. The VEGF mRNA is overexpressed by the majority of human tumors examined. Berkman et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n91:153-159 (1993); Brown et al., \nHuman Pathol. \n26:86-91 (1995); Brown et al., \nCancer Res. \n53:4727-4735 (1993); Mattern et al., \nBrit. J. Cancer \n73:931-934 (1996); Dvorak et al., \nAm. J. Pathol. \n146:1029-1039 (1995).\n\n\nAlso, the concentration levels of VEGF in eye fluids are highly correlated to the presence of active proliferation of blood vessels in patients with diabetic and other ischemia-related retinopathies. Aiello et al., \nN. Engl. J. Med. \n331:1480-1487 (1994). Furthermore, studies have demonstrated the localization of VEGF in choroidal neovascular membranes in patients affected by AMD. Lopez et al., \nInvest. Opthalmot. Vis. Sci. \n37:855-868 (1996).\n\n\nAnti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies suppress the growth of a variety of human tumor cell lines in nude mice (Kim et al., \nNature \n362:841-844 (1993); Warren et al., \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n95:1789-1797 (1995); Borgström et al., \nCancer Res. \n56:4032-4039 (1996); Melnyk et al., \nCancer Res. \n56:921-924 (1996)) and also inhibit intraocular angiogenesis in models of ischemic retinal disorders. Adamis et al., \nArch. Opthalmol. \n114:66-71 (1996). Therefore, anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies or other inhibitors of VEGF action are promising candidates for the treatment of tumors and various intraocular neovascular disorders. Such antibodies are described, for example, in EP 817,648 published Jan. 14, 1998; and in WO98/45331 and WO98/45332, both published Oct. 15, 1998. One of the anti-VEGF antibodies, bevacizumab, has been approved by the FDA for use in combination with a chemotherapy regimen to treat metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). And bevacizumab is being investigated in many ongoing clinical trials for treating various cancer indications.\n\n\nDuring development of the nervous system, neurons send out cable-like axons that migrate over long distances in order to reach their targets. See review by Carmeliet and Tessier-Lavigne (2005) \nNature \n436:193-200. At the leading tip of a growing axon is a highly motile, sensory structure called growth cone. Through dynamic cycles of extension and retraction of filopodial extensions, the growth cone continually senses and asseses from a myriad of guidance cues in its spatial environment, and accurately selects a correct track for extension towards its final target.\n\n\nOver the past decade, considerable progress has been made in understanding axon guidance mechanisms. See review by Dickson (2002) \nScience \n298:1959-64. Guidance cues come in four varieties: attractants and repellents; which may act either at short range (i.e., cell- or matrix-associated) or at longer range (i.e., diffusible). So far, four major families of axon guidance molecules have been identified: the netrins, semaphorins, ephrins and slits. See review by Huber et al (2003) \nAnnu Rev Neurosci \n26:509-63.\n\n\nThe semaphorins (Sema), also called collapsing, belong to a large family of phylogenetically conserved secreted and membrane-associated proteins. Members of the semaphorin family are capable of mediating both repulsive and attractive axon guidance events during neural development. Raper (2000) \nCurr Opin Neurobiol \n10:88-94. The more than thirty semaphorins identified to date all share a conserved N-terminal Sema domain of about 500 amino acids. Semaphorin members are classified into eight subfamilies depending on their structural similarities and species of origin. For more details on unified nomenclature for semaphorins, see Semaphorin Nomenclature Committee (1999) \nCell \n97:551-552.\n\n\nThe neuropilin (NRP) family is comprised of two homologous proteins, neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and neuropilin-2 (NRP2). NRP1 was first identified as a type 1130-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in growth cones of growing axons. NRP2 was subsequently identified by expression cloning. Fujisawa and Kitsukawa (1998) \nCurr Opin Neurobiol \n8:587-592. NRPs are found to be receptors for a subset of semaphorins, the \nclass\n 3 semaphorins. It was suggested that NRPs function as non-signaling co-receptors along with another semaphorin receptor family, plexins.\n\n\nAlthough initially described as a mediator of axon guidance, NRPs have also been found to play critical roles in vascular development. Carmeliet and Tessier-Lavigne (2005). It is identified as an isoform-specific VEGF receptor expressed on tumor and endothelial cells, prompting considerable efforts to understand the role of NRPs in vascular and tumor biology. Soker et al (1998) \nCell \n92:735-745; Klagsbrun et al (2002) \nAdv Exp Med Biol \n515:33-48. Genetic studies have provided strong evidence that Nrp1 is required for vascular morphogenesis. Loss of Nrp1 function results in vascular remodeling and branching defects, a phenotype that can be further enhanced by the loss of Nrp2 function. Kawasaki et al. (1999) \nDevelopment \n126:4895-4902; Takashima et al. (2002) \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n99:3657-3662. These results suggest that early in development Nrp1 and Nrp2 may have overlapping functions. However, the expression of each Nrp is partitioned later in development, with Nrp1 being expressed primarily in arteries, and Nrp2 in veins and lymphatic vessels. Yuan et al (2002) \nDevelopment \n129:4797-4806; Herzog et al. (2001) \nMech Dev \n109:115-119. Notably, loss of Nrp2 function alone specifically impairs lymphatic development.\n\n\nAs Nrp1 is expressed in many other cell types during development, the role of vascular Nrp1 was addressed through the generation of an EC-specific knock-out, which resulted in similar vascular defects to those seen in the null allele. Gu et al. (2003) \nDev Cell \n5:45-57. Interestingly, this study also showed that Sema3A binding to NRP1 is not required for vascular development. In another study, defects were observed in the guidance of endothelial tip cells in the developing hindbrain in Nrp1 KO embryos. Gerhardt et al. (2004) \nDev Dyn \n231:503-509.\n\n\nDespite the extensive studies in NRP1's role in vascular development, it remains unclear as to whether NRP1 exerts its vascular function exclusively via the VEGF-VEGF Receptor 2 (VEGFR2) pathway, as an enhancer for VEGF binding to VEGFR2 and thereby for VEGFR2 signaling, or via a signaling pathway independent of VEGFR2, or a combination of both.\n\n\nMonoclonal antibodies can be manufactured using recombinant DNA technology. Widespread use has been made of monoclonal antibodies, particularly those derived from rodents, however nonhuman antibodies are frequently antigenic in humans. The art has attempted to overcome this problem by constructing “chimeric” antibodies in which a nonhuman antigen-binding domain is coupled to a human constant domain (Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The isotype of the human constant domain may be selected to tailor the chimeric antibody for participation in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. In a further effort to resolve the antigen binding functions of antibodies and to minimize the use of heterologous sequences in human antibodies, humanized antibodies have been generated for various antigens in which substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted at regions by the corresponding sequence from a non-human species. For example, rodent residues have been substituted for the corresponding segments of a human antibody. In practice, humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some complementarity determining region (CDR) residues and possibly some framework region (FR) residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies. Jones et al. (1986) \nNature \n321:522-525; Riechmann et al. (1988) \nNature \n332:323-327; Verhoeyen et al. (1988) \nScience \n239:1534-1536.\n\n\nPrior to administering a therapeutic antibody to human, preclinical studies in nonhuman mammals are generally desired to evaluate the efficacy and/or toxicity of the antibody. Ideally, the antibodies subject to these studies are capable of recognizing and reacting with high potency to a target antigen endogenous to the host animal such as mouse or nonhuman primate.\n\n\nPhage display technology has provided a powerful tool for generating and selecting novel proteins that bind to a ligand, such as an antigen. Using the technique of phage display, large libraries of protein variants can be generated and rapidly sorted for those sequences that bind to a target antigen with high affinity. Nucleic acids encoding variant polypeptides are fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a viral coat protein, such as the gene III protein or the gene VIII protein. Monovalent phage display systems where the nucleic acid sequence encoding the protein or polypeptide is fused to a nucleic acid sequence encoding a portion of the gene III protein have been developed. (Bass, S. (1990) \nProteins \n8:309; Lowman and Wells (1991) \nMethods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology \n3:205). In a monovalent phage display system, the gene fusion is expressed at low levels and wild type gene III proteins are also expressed so that infectivity of the particles is retained. Methods of generating peptide libraries and screening those libraries have been disclosed in many patents (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,723,286, 5,432,018, 5,580,717, 5,427,908 and 5,498,530).\n\n\nThe demonstration of expression of peptides on the surface of filamentous phage and the expression of functional antibody fragments in the periplasm of \nE. coli \nwas important in the development of antibody phage display libraries. (Smith et al. (1985) \nScience \n228:1315; Skerra and Pluckthun (1988) \nScience \n240: 1038). Libraries of antibodies or antigen binding polypeptides have been prepared in a number of ways including by altering a single gene by inserting random DNA sequences or by cloning a family of related genes. Methods for displaying antibodies or antigen binding fragments using phage display have been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,750,373, 5,733,743, 5,837,242, 5,969,108, 6,172,197, 5,580,717, and 5,658,727. The library is then screened for expression of antibodies or antigen binding proteins with desired characteristics.\n\n\nPhage display technology has several advantages over conventional hybridoma and recombinant methods for preparing antibodies with the desired characteristics. This technology allows the development of large libraries of antibodies with diverse sequences in less time and without the use of animals. Preparation of hybridomas or preparation of humanized antibodies can easily require several months of preparation. In addition, since no immunization is required, phage antibody libraries can be generated for antigens which are toxic or have low antigenicity (Hogenboom (1988) \nImmunotechniques \n4:1-20). Phage antibody libraries can also be used to generate and identify novel therapeutic antibodies.\n\n\nPhage display libraries have been used to generate human antibodies from immunized, non-immunized humans, germ line sequences, or naïve B cell Ig repertories (Barbas & Burton (1996) \nTrends Biotech \n14:230; Griffiths et al. (1994) \nEMBO J. \n13:3245; Vaughan et al. (1996) \nNat. Biotech. \n14:309; Winter E P 0368 684 B1). Naïve, or nonimmune, antigen binding libraries have been generated using a variety of lymphoidal tissues. Some of these libraries are commercially available, such as those developed by Cambridge Antibody Technology and Morphosys (Vaughan et al. (1996) \nNature Biotech \n14:309; Knappik et al. (1999) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n296:57). However, many of these libraries have limited diversity.\n\n\nThe ability to identify and isolate high affinity antibodies from a phage display library is important in isolating novel antibodies for therapeutic use. Isolation of high affinity antibodies from a library is dependent on the size of the library, the efficiency of production in bacterial cells and the diversity of the library. See, for e.g., Knappik et al. (1999) \nJ. Mot. Biol \n296:57. The size of the library is decreased by inefficiency of production due to improper folding of the antibody or antigen binding protein and the presence of stop codons. Expression in bacterial cells can be inhibited if the antibody or antigen binding domain is not properly folded. Expression can be improved by mutating residues in turns at the surface of the variable/constant interface, or at selected CDR residues. (Deng et al. (1994) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n269:9533, Ulrich et al. (1995) \nPNAS, \n92:11907-11911; Forsberg et al. (1997) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n272: 12430). The sequence of the framework region is a factor in providing for proper folding when antibody phage libraries are produced in bacterial cells.\n\n\nGenerating a diverse library of antibodies or antigen binding proteins is also important to isolation of high affinity antibodies. Libraries with diversification in limited CDRs have been generated using a variety of approaches. See, e.g., Tomlinson (2000) \nNature Biotech. \n18:989-994. CDR3 regions are of interest in part because they often are found to participate in antigen binding. CDR3 regions on the heavy chain vary greatly in size, sequence and structural conformation.\n\n\nOthers have also generated diversity by randomizing CDR regions of the variable heavy and light chains using all 20 amino acids at each position. It was thought that using all 20 amino acids would result in a large diversity of sequences of variant antibodies and increase the chance of identifying novel antibodies. (Barbas (1994) \nPNAS \n91:3809; Yelton, D E (1995) \nJ. Immunology \n155:1994; Jackson, J. R. (1995) \nJ. Immunology \n154:3310 and Hawkins, R E (1992) \nJ. Mol. Biology \n226:889).\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides novel anti-NRP1 antibodies capable of modulating at least one neuropilin mediated biological activity. Preferably, the anti-NRP1 antibodies are antagonist antibodies capable of inhibiting at least one neuropilin mediated biological activity. More specifically, the present invention provides methods of generating anti-NRP1 antibodies from a designed human synthetic antibody phage library, and novel function blocking anti-NRP1 antibodies generated thereof. The anti-NRP1 antibodies of the invention fall into two classes, depending on where they bind to on NRP1: anti-NRP1\nA \nantibodies (including YW64.3 and variants thereof) are those that bind to the CUB domains (a1a2) of NRP1; and anti-NRP1\nB \nantibodies (including YW107.4 and variants thereof) are those that bind to the coagulation factor V/VIII domains (b1b2) of NRP1.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the anti-NRP1\nA \nantibodies of the invention can be selected from the “YW64” antibody clones as shown in Table III, having the identified partial CDR sequences and binding affinities to murine and human NRP1s. The anti-NRP1\nA \nantibody of the invention preferably comprises a light chain variable domain comprising the following CDR amino acid sequences: CDRL1 (RASQSISSYLA; SEQ ID NO:123), CDRL2 (GASSRAS; SEQ ID NO:124) and CDRL3 (QQYMSVPIT; SEQ ID NO:125). For example, the anti-NRP1\nA \nantibody comprises a light chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:3. The anti-NRP1\nA \nantibody of the invention preferably comprises a heavy chain variable domain comprising the following CDR amino acid sequences: CDRH1 (GFSFSSEPIS; SEQ ID NO:126), CDRH2 (SSITGKNGYTYYADSVKG; SEQ ID NO:127) and CDRH3 (WGKKVYGMDV; SEQ ID NO:128). For example, the anti-NRP1\nA \nantibody comprises a heavy chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:4. More preferably, the anti-NRP1\nA \nantibody of the invention is the YW64.3 antibody comprising a light chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:3 and a heavy chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:4.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the anti-NRP1\nB \nantibodies of the invention can be selected from the “YW107.4” antibody clones as shown in Table IV, having the identified partial CDR sequences and binding affinities to murine and human NRP1s. The anti-NRP1\nB \nantibody of the invention preferably comprises a light chain variable domain comprising the following CDR amino acid sequences: CDRL1 (RASQYFSSYLA; SEQ ID NO:129), CDRL2 (GASSRAS; SEQ ID NO:130) and CDRL3 (QQYLGSPPT; SEQ ID NO:131). For example, the anti-NRP1\nB \nantibody comprises a light chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:5. The anti-NRP1\nB \nantibody of the invention preferably comprises a heavy chain variable domain comprising the following CDR amino acid sequences: CDRH1 (GFTFSSYAMS; SEQ ID NO:132), CDRH2 (SQISPAGGYTNYADSVKG; SEQ ID NO:133) and CDRH3 (ELPYYRMSKVMDV; SEQ ID NO:134). For example, the anti-NRP1\nB \nantibody comprises a heavy chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:6. More preferably, the anti-NRP1\nB \nantibody of the invention is the YW107.4.87 antibody comprising a light chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:5 and a heavy chain variable domain sequence of SEQ ID NO:6.\n\n\nAlso provided by the present invention are uses of the anti-NRP1 antibodies for treating angiogenesis associated disorders such as cancer. In one preferred embodiment, the anti-NRP1 antibodies of invention are used in combination with an anti-VEGF antibody. Preferably, the anti-VEGF antibody is capable of binding to the same VEGF epitope as the antibody A4.6.1. More preferably, the anti-VEGF antibody is bevacizumab or ranibizumab.\n\n\n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n \nFIG. 1\n illustrates binding specificities of anti-NRP1 antibodies.

(2000) \nGenomics \n70:211-222. Neuropilins are 120 to 130 kDa non-tyrosine kinase receptors. There are multiple NRP-1 and NRP-2 splice variants and soluble isoforms. The basic structure of neuropilins comprises five domains: three extracellular domains (a1a2, b1b2 and c), a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. The a1a2 domain is homologous to complement components C1r and C1s (CUB), which generally contains four cysteine residues that form two disculfid bridges. The b1b2 domain is homologous to coagulation factors V and VIII. The central portion of the c domain is designated as MAM due to its homology to meprin, A5 and receptor tyrosine phosphotase μ proteins. The a1a2 and b1b2 domains are responsible for ligand binding, whereas the c domain is critical for homodimerization or heterodimerization. Gu et al. (2002) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n277:18069-76; He and Tessier-Lavigne (1997) \nCell \n90:739-51.\n\n\n“Neuropilin mediated biological activity” refers in general to physiological or pathological events in which neuropilin-1 and/or neuropilin-2 plays a substantial role. Non-limiting examples of such activities are axon guidance during embryonic nervous system development or neuron-regeneration, angiogenesis (including vascular modeling), tumorgenesis and tumor metastasis.\n\n\nThe term “antibody” is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.\n\n\nThe term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. (1975) \nNature \n256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The “monoclonal antibodies” may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. (1991) \nNature \n352:624-628 and Marks et al. (1991) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222:581-597, for example.\n\n\nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include “chimeric” antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al. (1984) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81:6851-6855).\n\n\n“Humanized” forms of non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies are chimeric antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al. (1986) \nNature \n321:522-525; Riechmann et al. (1988) \nNature \n332:323-329; and Presta (1992) \nCurr. Op. Struct. Biol \n2:593-596.\n\n\nA “species-dependent antibody” is one which has a stronger binding affinity for an antigen from a first mammalian species than it has for a homologue of that antigen from a second mammalian species. Normally, the species-dependent antibody “binds specifically” to a human antigen (i.e. has a binding affinity (K\nd\n) value of no more than about 1×10\n−7 \nM, preferably no more than about 1×10\n−8 \nM and most preferably no more than about 1×10\n−9 \nM) but has a binding affinity for a homologue of the antigen from a second nonhuman mammalian species which is at least about 50 fold, or at least about 500 fold, or at least about 1000 fold, weaker than its binding affinity for the human antigen. The species-dependent antibody can be any of the various types of antibodies as defined above, but preferably is a humanized or human antibody.\n\n\nAs used herein, “antibody mutant” or “antibody variant” refers to an amino acid sequence variant of the species-dependent antibody wherein one or more of the amino acid residues of the species-dependent antibody have been modified. Such mutants necessarily have less than 100% sequence identity or similarity with the species-dependent antibody. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody mutant will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain of the species-dependent antibody, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or similarity with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical (i.e same residue) or similar (i.e. amino acid residue from the same group based on common side-chain properties, see below) with the species-dependent antibody residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence outside of the variable domain shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or similarity.\n\n\nAn “isolated” antibody is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments, the antibody will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method, and most preferably more than 99% by weight, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody's natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily, however, isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.\n\n\nAs used herein, “antibody variable domain” refers to the portions of the light and heavy chains of antibody molecules that include amino acid sequences of Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs; ie., CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3), and Framework Regions (FRs). V\nH \nrefers to the variable domain of the heavy chain. V\nL \nrefers to the variable domain of the light chain. According to the methods used in this invention, the amino acid positions assigned to CDRs and FRs may be defined according to Kabat (Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1987 and 1991)). Amino acid numbering of antibodies or antigen binding fragments is also according to that of Kabat.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs; ie., CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3) refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody variable domain the presence of which are necessary for antigen binding. Each variable domain typically has three CDR regions identified as CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3. Each complementarity determining region may comprise amino acid residues from a “complementarity determining region” as defined by Kabat (i.e. about residues 24-34 (L1), 50-56 (L2) and 89-97 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 31-35 (H1), 50-65 (H2) and 95-102 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al., \nSequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, \n5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)) and/or those residues from a “hypervariable loop” (i.e. about residues 26-32 (L1), 50-52 (L2) and 91-96 (L3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (H1), 53-55 (H2) and 96-101 (H3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk (1987) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901-917). In some instances, a complementarity determining region can include amino acids from both a CDR region defined according to Kabat and a hypervariable loop. For example, the CDRH1 of the heavy chain of antibody 4D5 includes \namino acids\n 26 to 35.\n\n\n“Framework regions” (hereinafter FR) are those variable domain residues other than the CDR residues. Each variable domain typically has four FRs identified as FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4. If the CDRs are defined according to Kabat, the light chain FR residues are positioned at about residues 1-23 (LCFR1), 35-49 (LCFR2), 57-88 (LCFR3), and 98-107 (LCFR4) and the heavy chain FR residues are positioned about at residues 1-30 (HCFR1), 36-49 (HCFR2), 66-94 (HCFR3), and 103-113 (HCFR4) in the heavy chain residues. If the CDRs comprise amino acid residues from hypervariable loops, the light chain FR residues are positioned about at residues 1-25 (LCFR1), 33-49 (LCFR2), 53-90 (LCFR3), and 97-107 (LCFR4) in the light chain and the heavy chain FR residues are positioned about at residues 1-25 (HCFR1), 33-52 (HCFR2), 56-95 (HCFR3), and 102-113 (HCFR4) in the heavy chain residues. In some instances, when the CDR comprises amino acids from both a CDR as defined by Kabat and those of a hypervariable loop, the FR residues will be adjusted accordingly. For example, when CDRH1 includes amino acids H26-H35, the heavy chain FR1 residues are at positions 1-25 and the FR2 residues are at positions 36-49.\n\n\nAs used herein, “codon set” refers to a set of different nucleotide triplet sequences used to encode desired variant amino acids. A set of oligonucleotides can be synthesized, for example, by solid phase synthesis, including sequences that represent all possible combinations of nucleotide triplets provided by the codon set and that will encode the desired group of amino acids. A standard form of codon designation is that of the IUB code, which is known in the art and described herein. A codon set typically is represented by 3 capital letters in italics, eg. NNK, NNS, XYZ, DVK and the like. A “non-random codon set”, as used herein, thus refers to a codon set that encodes select amino acids that fulfill partially, preferably completely, the criteria for amino acid selection as described herein. Synthesis of oligonucleotides with selected nucleotide “degeneracy” at certain positions is well known in that art, for example the TRIM approach (Knappek et al. (1999) \nJ. Mol. Biol \n296:57-86); Garrard & Henner (1993) \nGene \n128:103). Such sets of oligonucleotides having certain codon sets can be synthesized using commercial nucleic acid synthesizers (available from, for example, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.), or can be obtained commercially (for example, from Life Technologies, Rockville, Md.). Therefore, a set of oligonucleotides synthesized having a particular codon set will typically include a plurality of oligonucleotides with different sequences, the differences established by the codon set within the overall sequence. Oligonucleotides, as used according to the invention, have sequences that allow for hybridization to a variable domain nucleic acid template and also can, but does not necessarily, include restriction enzyme sites useful for, for example, cloning purposes.\n\n\nAn “Fv” fragment is an antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight association, which can be covalent in nature, for example in scFv. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the V\nH\n-V\nL \ndimer. Collectively, the six CDRs or a subset thereof confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However, even a single variable domain (or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although usually at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\nThe “Fab” fragment contains a variable and constant domain of the light chain and a variable domain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. F(ab′)\n2 \nantibody fragments comprise a pair of Fab fragments which are generally covalently linked near their carboxy termini by hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known in the art.\n\n\n“Single-chain Fv” or “scFv” antibody fragments comprise the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains, which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv, see Pluckthun in \nThe Pharmacology of Monoclonal Antibodies\n, \nVol\n 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315 (1994).\n\n\nThe term “diabodies” refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) in the same polypeptide chain (V\nH \nand V\nL\n). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, for example, EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Hollinger et al. (1993) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n90:6444-6448.\n\n\nThe expression “linear antibodies” refers to the antibodies described in Zapata et al. (1995 \nProtein Eng, \n8(10):1057-1062). Briefly, these antibodies comprise a pair of tandem Fd segments (V\nH\n-C\nH\n1-V\nH\n-C\nH\n1) which, together with complementary light chain polypeptides, form a pair of antigen binding regions. Linear antibodies can be bispecific or monospecific.\n\n\nAs used herein, “library” refers to a plurality of antibody or antibody fragment sequences (for example, polypeptides of the invention), or the nucleic acids that encode these sequences, the sequences being different in the combination of variant amino acids that are introduced into these sequences according to the methods of the invention.\n\n\n“Phage display” is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to at least a portion of coat protein on the surface of phage, e.g., filamentous phage, particles. A utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of randomized protein variants can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target antigen with high affinity. Display of peptide and protein libraries on phage has been used for screening millions of polypeptides for ones with specific binding properties. Polyvalent phage display methods have been used for displaying small random peptides and small proteins through fusions to either gene III or gene VIII of filamentous phage. Wells and Lowman (1992) \nCurr. Opin. Struct. Biol. \n3:355-362, and references cited therein. In a monovalent phage display, a protein or peptide library is fused to a gene III or a portion thereof, and expressed at low levels in the presence of wild type gene III protein so that phage particles display one copy or none of the fusion proteins. Avidity effects are reduced relative to polyvalent phage so that sorting is on the basis of intrinsic ligand affinity, and phagemid vectors are used, which simplify DNA manipulations. Lowman and Wells (1991) \nMethods: A companion to Methods in Enzymology \n3:205-0216.\n\n\nA “phagemid” is a plasmid vector having a bacterial origin of replication, e.g., Co1E1, and a copy of an intergenic region of a bacteriophage. The phagemid may be used on any known bacteriophage, including filamentous bacteriophage and lambdoid bacteriophage. The plasmid will also generally contain a selectable marker for antibiotic resistance. Segments of DNA cloned into these vectors can be propagated as plasmids. When cells harboring these vectors are provided with all genes necessary for the production of phage particles, the mode of replication of the plasmid changes to rolling circle replication to generate copies of one strand of the plasmid DNA and package phage particles. The phagemid may form infectious or non-infectious phage particles. This term includes phagemids which contain a phage coat protein gene or fragment thereof linked to a heterologous polypeptide gene as a gene fusion such that the heterologous polypeptide is displayed on the surface of the phage particle.\n\n\nThe term “phage vector” means a double stranded replicative form of a bacteriophage containing a heterologous gene and capable of replication. The phage vector has a phage origin of replication allowing phage replication and phage particle formation. The phage is preferably a filamentous bacteriophage, such as an M13, f1, fd, Pf3 phage or a derivative thereof, or a lambdoid phage, such as lambda, 21, phi80, phi81, 82, 424, 434, etc., or a derivative thereof.\n\n\nAs used herein, “solvent accessible position” refers to a position of an amino acid residue in the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of a source antibody or antigen binding fragment that is determined, based on structure, ensemble of structures and/or modeled structure of the antibody or antigen binding fragment, as potentially available for solvent access and/or contact with a molecule, such as an antibody-specific antigen. These positions are typically found in the CDRs and on the exterior of the protein. The solvent accessible positions of an antibody or antigen binding fragment, as defined herein, can be determined using any of a number of algorithms known in the art. Preferably, solvent accessible positions are determined using coordinates from a 3-dimensional model of an antibody, preferably using a computer program such as the InsightII program (Accelrys, San Diego, Calif.). Solvent accessible positions can also be determined using algorithms known in the art (e.g., Lee and Richards (1971) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n55, 379 and Connolly (1983) \nJ. Appl. Cryst. \n16, 548). Determination of solvent accessible positions can be performed using software suitable for protein modeling and 3-dimensional structural information obtained from an antibody. Software that can be utilized for these purposes includes SYBYL Biopolymer Module software (Tripos Associates). Generally and preferably, where an algorithm (program) requires a user input size parameter, the “size” of a probe which is used in the calculation is set at about 1.4 Angstrom or smaller in radius. In addition, determination of solvent accessible regions and area methods using software for personal computers has been described by Pacios (1994) \nComput. Chem. \n18(4): 377-386.\n\n\nAn “angiogenic factor or agent” is a growth factor which stimulates the development of blood vessels, e.g., promote angiogenesis, endothelial cell growth, stability of blood vessels, and/or vasculogenesis, etc. For example, angiogenic factors, include, but are not limited to, e.g., VEGF and members of the VEGF family, PlGF, PDGF family, fibroblast growth factor family (FGFs), TIE ligands (Angiopoietins), ephrins, Del-1, fibroblast growth factors: acidic (aFGF) and basic (bFGF), Follistatin, Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/scatter factor (SF), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Leptin, Midkine, neuropilins, Placental growth factor, Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), Platelet-derived growth factor, especially PDGF-BB or PDGFR-beta, Pleiotrophin (PTN), Progranulin, Proliferin, Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), etc. It would also include factors that accelerate wound healing, such as growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), VIGF, epidermal growth factor (EGF), CTGF and members of its family, and TGF-alpha and TGF-beta. See, e.g., Klagsbrun and D'Amore (1991) \nAnnu. Rev. Physiol \n53:217-39; Streit and Detmar (2003) \nOncogene \n22:3172-3179; Ferrara & Alitalo (1999) \nNature Medicine \n5(12):1359-1364; Tonini et al. (2003) \nOncogene \n22:6549-6556 (e.g., Table 1 listing known angiogenic factors); and, Sato (2003) \nInt. J. Clin. Oncol. \n8:200-206.\n\n\nAn “anti-angiogenesis agent” or “angiogenesis inhibitor” refers to a small molecular weight substance, an polynucleotide, an polypeptide, an isolated protein, a recombinant protein, an antibody, or conjugates or fusion proteins thereof, that inhibits angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, or undesirable vascular permeability, either directly or indirectly. It should be understood that the anti-angiogenesis agent includes those agents that bind and block the angiogenic activity of the angiogenic factor or its receptor. For example, an anti-angiogenesis agent is an antibody or other antagonist to an angiogenic agent as defined above, e.g., antibodies to VEGF-A or to the VEGF-A receptor (e.g., KDR receptor or Flt-1 receptor), anti-PDGFR inhibitors such as Gleevec™ (Imatinib Mesylate). Anti-angiogensis agents also include native angiogenesis inhibitors, e.g., angiostatin, endostatin, etc. See, e.g., Klagsbrun and D'Amore (1991) \nAnnu. Rev. Physiol \n53:217-39; Streit and Detmar (2003) \nOncogene \n22:3172-3179 (e.g., Table 3 listing anti-angiogenic therapy in malignant melanoma); Ferrara & Alitalo (1999) \nNature Medicine \n5(12):1359-1364; Tonini et al. (2003) \nOncogene \n22:6549-6556 (e.g., Table 2 listing known antiangiogenic factors); and, Sato (2003) \nInt. J. Clin. Oncol \n8:200-206 (e.g., Table 1 listing anti-angiogenic agents used in clinical trials).\n\n\nThe term “VEGF” or “VEGF-A” as used herein refers to the 165-amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factor and related 121-, 189-, and 206-amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factors, as described by Leung et al. (1989) \nScience \n246:1306, and Houck et al. (1991) \nMol. Endocrin, \n5:1806, together with the naturally occurring allelic and processed forms thereof. The term “VEGF” also refers to VEGFs from non-human species such as mouse, rat or primate. Sometimes the VEGF from a specific species are indicated by terms such as hVEGF for human VEGF, mVEGF for murine VEGF, and etc. The term “VEGF” is also used to refer to truncated forms of the polypeptide comprising \namino acids\n 8 to 109 or 1 to 109 of the 165-amino acid human vascular endothelial cell growth factor. Reference to any such forms of VEGF may be identified in the present application, e.g., by “VEGF (8-109),” “VEGF (1-109)” or “VEGF\n165\n.” The amino acid positions for a “truncated” native VEGF are numbered as indicated in the native VEGF sequence. For example, amino acid position 17 (methionine) in truncated native VEGF is also position 17 (methionine) in native VEGF. The truncated native VEGF has binding affinity for the KDR and Flt-1 receptors comparable to native VEGF.\n\n\nAn “anti-VEGF antibody” is an antibody that binds to VEGF with sufficient affinity and specificity. Preferably, the anti-VEGF antibody of the invention can be used as a therapeutic agent in targeting and interfering with diseases or conditions wherein the VEGF activity is involved. An anti-VEGF antibody will usually not bind to other VEGF homologues such as VEGF-B or VEGF-C, nor other growth factors such as PlGF, PDGF or bFGF. A preferred anti-VEGF antibody is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the same epitope as the monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody A4.6.1 produced by hybridoma ATCC HB 10709. More preferably the anti-VEGF antibody is a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody generated according to Presta et al. (1997) \nCancer Res. \n57:4593-4599, including but not limited to the antibody known as bevacizumab (BV; Avastin™).\n\n\nThe anti-VEGF antibody “Bevacizumab (BV)”, also known as “rhuMAb VEGF” or “Avastin®, is a recombinant humanized anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody generated according to Presta et al. (1997) \nCancer Res. \n57:4593-4599. It comprises mutated human IgG1 framework regions and antigen-binding complementarity-determining regions from the murine anti-hVEGF monoclonal antibody A.4.6.1 that blocks binding of human VEGF to its receptors. Approximately 93% of the amino acid sequence of Bevacizumab, including most of the framework regions, is derived from human IgG1, and about 7% of the sequence is derived from the murine antibody A4.6.1. Bevacizumab has a molecular mass of about 149,000 daltons and is glycosylated.\n\n\nA “VEGF antagonist” refers to a molecule capable of neutralizing, blocking, inhibiting, abrogating, reducing or interfering with VEGF activities including its binding to one or more VEGF receptors. VEGF antagonists include anti-VEGF antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, receptor molecules and derivatives which bind specifically to VEGF thereby sequestering its binding to one or more receptors, anti-VEGF receptor antibodies and VEGF receptor antagonists such as small molecule inhibitors of the VEGFR tyrosine kinases.\n\n\n“Treatment” refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those in which the disorder is to be prevented.\n\n\nA “disorder” is any condition that would benefit from treatment with the antibody. For example, mammals who suffer from or need prophylaxis against abnormal angiogenesis (excessive, inappropriate or uncontrolled angiogenesis) or vascular permeability. This includes chronic and acute disorders or diseases including those pathological conditions which predispose the mammal to the disorder in question. Non-limiting examples of disorders to be treated herein include malignant and benign tumors; non-leukemias and lymphoid malignancies; neuronal, glial, astrocytal, hypothalamic and other glandular, macrophagal, epithelial, stromal and blastocoelic disorders; and inflammatory, angiogenic and immunologic disorders.\n\n\nAbnormal angiogenesis occurs when new blood vessels either grow excessively, insufficiently or inappropriately (e.g., the location, timing or onset of the angiogenesis being undesired from a medical standpoint) in a diseased state or such that it causes a diseased state. Excessive, inappropriate or uncontrolled angiogenesis occurs when there is new blood vessel growth that contributes to the worsening of the diseased state or causes a diseased state, such as in cancer, especially vascularized solid tumors and metastatic tumors (including colon, lung cancer (especially small-cell lung cancer), or prostate cancer), diseases caused by ocular neovascularisation, especially diabetic blindness, retinopathies, primarily diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration (AMD), psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, haemangioblastoma such as haemangioma; inflammatory renal diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, especially mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, diabetic nephropathy or hypertensive nephrosclerosis; various inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, especially rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, sarcoidosis, arterial arteriosclerosis and diseases occurring after transplants, endometriosis or chronic asthma and more than 70 other conditions. The new blood vessels can feed the diseased tissues, destroy normal tissues, and in the case of cancer, the new vessels can allow tumor cells to escape into the circulation and lodge in other organs (tumor metastases). Insufficient angiogenesis occurs when there is inadequate blood vessels growth that contributes to the worsening of a diseased state, e.g., in diseases such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and delayed wound healing. Further, ulcers, strokes, and heart attacks can result from the absence of angiogenesis that normally required for natural healing.

No. 4,675,187), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, acids or derivatives of any of the above.\n\n\nThe term “prodrug” as used in this application refers to a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance that is less cytotoxic to tumor cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically activated or converted into the more active parent form. See, e.g., Wilman (1986) “Prodrugs in Cancer Chemotherapy” \nBiochemical Society Transactions, \n14, pp. 375-382, 615th Meeting Belfast and Stella et al. (1985). “Prodrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery,” \nDirected Drug Deliver\n, Borchardt et al., (ed.), pp. 247-267, Humana Press. The prodrugs of this invention include, but are not limited to, phosphate-containing prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing prodrugs, sulfate-containing prodrugs, peptide-containing prodrugs, D-amino acid-modified prodrugs, glycosylated pro drugs, β-lactam-containing pro drugs, optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide-containing prodrugs, 5-fluorocytosine and other 5-fluorouridine prodrugs which can be converted into the more active cytotoxic free drug. Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, those chemotherapeutic agents described above.\n\n\nAn “isolated” nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the antibody nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However, an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the antibody where, for example, the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.\n\n\nThe expression “control sequences” refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to utilize promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.\n\n\nNucleic acid is “operably linked” when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, “operably linked” means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.\n\n\nAs used herein, the expressions “cell,” “cell line,” and “cell culture” are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. Thus, the words “transformants” and “transformed cells” include the primary subject cell and cultures derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. Where distinct designations are intended, it will be clear from the context.\n\n\nMODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION\n\n\nProduction of Anti-NRP1 Antibodies\n\n\nThe invention herein provides novel anti-NRP1 antibodies. Exemplary methods for generating antibodies are described in more detail in the following sections.\n\n\nThe novel anti-NRP1 antibodies are selected using the NRP1 antigen derived from a mammalian species. Preferably the antigen is human NRP1 (hNRP1). However, NRPs from other species such as murine NRP1 (mNRP1) can also be used as the target antigen. The NRP antigens from various mammalian species may be isolated from natural sources. In other embodiments, the antigen is produced recombinantly or made using other synthetic methods known in the art.\n\n\nThe antibody selected will normally have a sufficiently strong binding affinity for the NRP1 antigen. For example, the antibody may bind hNRP1 with a K\nd \nvalue of no more than about 5 nM, preferably no more than about 2 nM, and more preferably no more than about 500 pM. Antibody affinities may be determined by a surface plasmon resonance based assay (such as the BIAcore assay as described in Examples); enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA); and competition assays (e.g. RIA's), for example.\n\n\nAlso, the antibody may be subject to other biological activity assays, e.g., in order to evaluate its effectiveness as a therapeutic. Such assays are known in the art and depend on the target antigen and intended use for the antibody. Examples include the HUVEC inhibition assay (as described in the Examples below); tumor cell growth inhibition assays (as described in WO 89/06692, for example); antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) assays (U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362); and agonistic activity or hematopoiesis assays (see WO 95/27062).\n\n\nTo screen for antibodies which bind to a particular epitope on the antigen of interest, a routine cross-blocking assay such as that described in \nAntibodies, A Laboratory Manual\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988), can be performed. Alternatively, epitope mapping, e.g. as described in Champe et al. (1995) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n270:1388-1394, can be performed to determine whether the antibody binds an epitope of interest.\n\n\nGeneration of Novel Anti-NRP1 Antibodies from Synthetic Antibody Phage Libraries\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a method for generating and selecting novel anti-NRP1 antibodies using a unique phage display approach. The approach involves generation of synthetic antibody phage libraries based on single framework template, design of sufficient diversities within variable domains, display of polypeptides having the diversified variable domains, selection of candidate antibodies with high affinity to target NRP1 antigen, and isolation of the selected antibodies.\n\n\nDetails of the phage display methods can be found, for example, in WO03/102157 published Dec. 11, 2003.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the antibody libraries used in the invention can be generated by mutating the solvent accessible and/or highly diverse positions in at least one CDR of an antibody variable domain. Some or all of the CDRs can be mutated using the methods provided herein. In some embodiments, it may be preferable to generate diverse antibody libraries by mutating positions in CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3 to form a single library or by mutating positions in CDRL3 and CDRH3 to form a single library or by mutating positions in CDRL3 and CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3 to form a single library.\n\n\nA library of antibody variable domains can be generated, for example, having mutations in the solvent accessible and/or highly diverse positions of CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3. Another library can be generated having mutations in CDRL1, CDRL2 and CDRL3. These libraries can also be used in conjunction with each other to generate binders of desired affinities. For example, after one or more rounds of selection of heavy chain libraries for binding to a target antigen, a light chain library can be replaced into the population of heavy chain binders for further rounds of selection to increase the affinity of the binders.\n\n\nPreferably, a library is created by substitution of original amino acids with variant amino acids in the CDRH3 region of the variable region of the heavy chain sequence. The resulting library can contain a plurality of antibody sequences, wherein the sequence diversity is primarily in the CDRH3 region of the heavy chain sequence.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the library is created in the context of the humanized antibody 4D5 sequence, or the sequence of the framework amino acids of the humanized antibody 4D5 sequence. Preferably, the library is created by substitution of at least residues 95-100a of the heavy chain with amino acids encoded by the DVK codon set, wherein the DVK codon set is used to encode a set of variant amino acids for every one of these positions. An example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (DVK)\n7\n. In some embodiments, a library is created by substitution of residues 95-100a with amino acids encoded by both DVK and NNK codon sets. An example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (DVK)\n6 \n(NNK). In another embodiment, a library is created by substitution of at least residues 95-100a with amino acids encoded by both DVK and NNK codon sets. An example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (DVK)\n5 \n(NNK). Another example of an oligonucleotide set that is useful for creating these substitutions comprises the sequence (NNK)\n6\n. Other examples of suitable oligonucleotide sequences can be determined by one skilled in the art according to the criteria described herein.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, different CDRH3 designs are utilized to isolate high affinity binders and to isolate binders for a variety of epitopes. The range of lengths of CDRH3 generated in this library is 11 to 13 amino acids, although lengths different from this can also be generated. H3 diversity can be expanded by using NNK, DVK and NVK codon sets, as well as more limited diversity at N and/or C-terminal.\n\n\nDiversity can also be generated in CDRH1 and CDRH2. The designs of CDR-H1 and H2 diversities follow the strategy of targeting to mimic natural antibodies repertoire as described with modification that focus the diversity more closely matched to the natural diversity than previous design.\n\n\nFor diversity in CDRH3, multiple libraries can be constructed separately with different lengths of H3 and then combined to select for binders to target antigens. The multiple libraries can be pooled and sorted using solid support selection and solution sorting methods as described previously and herein below. Multiple sorting strategies may be employed. For example, one variation involves sorting on target bound to a solid, followed by sorting for a tag that may be present on the fusion polypeptide (eg. anti-gD tag) and followed by another sort on target bound to solid. Alternatively, the libraries can be sorted first on target bound to a solid surface, the eluted binders are then sorted using solution phase binding with decreasing concentrations of target antigen. Utilizing combinations of different sorting methods provides for minimization of selection of only highly expressed sequences and provides for selection of a number of different high affinity clones.\n\n\nHigh affinity binders for the target NRP1 antigen can be isolated from the libraries. Limiting diversity in the H1/H2 region decreases degeneracy about 10\n4 \nto 10\n5 \nfold and allowing more H3 diversity provides for more high affinity binders. Utilizing libraries with different types of diversity in CDRH3 (eg. utilizing DVK or NVT) provides for isolation of binders that may bind to different epitopes of a target antigen.\n\n\nOf the binders isolated from the pooled libraries as described above, it has been discovered that affinity may be further improved by providing limited diversity in the light chain. Light chain diversity is generated in this embodiment as follows in CDRL1: \namino acid position\n 28 is encoded by RDT; \namino acid position\n 29 is encoded by RKT; \namino acid position\n 30 is encoded by RVW; \namino acid position\n 31 is encoded by ANW; \namino acid position\n 32 is encoded by THT; optionally, \namino acid position\n 33 is encoded by CTG; in CDRL2: \namino acid position\n 50 is encoded by KBG; \namino acid position\n 53 is encoded by AVC; and optionally, \namino acid position\n 55 is encoded by GMA; in CDRL3: \namino acid position\n 91 is encoded by TMT or SRT or both; \namino acid position\n 92 is encoded by DMC; \namino acid position\n 93 is encoded by RVT; \namino acid position\n 94 is encoded by NHT; and \namino acid position\n 96 is encoded by TWT or YKG or both.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, a library or libraries with diversity in CDRH1, CDRH2 and CDRH3 regions is generated. In this embodiment, diversity in CDRH3 is generated using a variety of lengths of H3 regions and using primarily codon sets XYZ and NNK or NNS. Libraries can be formed using individual oligonucleotides and pooled or oligonucleotides can be pooled to form a subset of libraries. The libraries of this embodiment can be sorted against target bound to solid. Clones isolated from multiple sorts can be screened for specificity and affinity using ELISA assays. For specificity, the clones can be screened against the desired target antigens as well as other nontarget antigens. Those binders to the target NRP1 antigen can then be screened for affinity in solution binding competition ELISA assay or spot competition assay. High affinity binders can be isolated from the library utilizing XYZ codon sets prepared as described above. These binders can be readily produced as antibodies or antigen binding fragments in high yield in cell culture.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, it may be desirable to generate libraries with a greater diversity in lengths of CDRH3 region. For example, it may be desirable to generate libraries with CDRH3 regions ranging from about 7 to 19 amino acids.\n\n\nHigh affinity binders isolated from the libraries of these embodiments are readily produced in bacterial and eukaryotic cell culture in high yield. The vectors can be designed to readily remove sequences such as gD tags, viral coat protein component sequence, and/or to add in constant region sequences to provide for production of full length antibodies or antigen binding fragments in high yield.\n\n\nA library with mutations in CDRH3 can be combined with a library containing variant versions of other CDRs, for example CDRL1, CDRL2, CDRL3, CDRH1 and/or CDRH2. Thus, for example, in one embodiment, a CDRH3 library is combined with a CDRL3 library created in the context of the humanized 4D5 antibody sequence with variant amino acids at \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n 28, 29, 30, 31, and/or 32 using predetermined codon sets. In another embodiment, a library with mutations to the CDRH3 can be combined with a library comprising variant CDRH1 and/or CDRH2 heavy chain variable domains. In one embodiment, the CDRH1 library is created with the humanized antibody 4D5 sequence with variant amino acids at \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n 28, 30, 31, 32 and 33. A CDRH2 library may be created with the sequence of humanized antibody 4D5 with variant amino acids at \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n 50, 52, 53, 54, 56 and 58 using the predetermined codon sets.\n\n\nAnti-NRP1 Antibody Mutants\n\n\nThe novel anti-NRP1 antibody generated from phage libraries can be further modified to generate antibody mutants with improved physical, chemical and or biological properties over the parent antibody. Where the assay used is a biological activity assay, the antibody mutant preferably has a biological activity in the assay of choice which is at least about 10 fold better, preferably at least about 20 fold better, more preferably at least about 50 fold better, and sometimes at least about 100 fold or 200 fold better, than the biological activity of the parent antibody in that assay. For example, an anti-NRP1 antibody mutant preferably has a binding affinity for NRP1 which is at least about 10 fold stronger, preferably at least about 20 fold stronger, more preferably at least about 50 fold stronger, and sometimes at least about 100 fold or 200 fold stronger, than the binding affinity of the parent anti-NRP1 antibody.\n\n\nTo generate the antibody mutant, one or more amino acid alterations (e.g. substitutions) are introduced in one or more of the hypervariable regions of the parent antibody. Alternatively, or in addition, one or more alterations (e.g. substitutions) of framework region residues may be introduced in the parent antibody where these result in an improvement in the binding affinity of the antibody mutant for the antigen from the second mammalian species. Examples of framework region residues to modify include those which non-covalently bind antigen directly (Amit et al. (1986) \nScience \n233:747-753); interact with/effect the conformation of a CDR (Chothia et al. (1987) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196:901-917); and/or participate in the V\nL\n-V\nH \ninterface (EP 239 400B1). In certain embodiments, modification of one or more of such framework region residues results in an enhancement of the binding affinity of the antibody for the antigen from the second mammalian species. For example, from about one to about five framework residues may be altered in this embodiment of the invention. Sometimes, this may be sufficient to yield an antibody mutant suitable for use in preclinical trials, even where none of the hypervariable region residues have been altered. Normally, however, the antibody mutant will comprise additional hypervariable region alteration(s).\n\n\nThe hypervariable region residues which are altered may be changed randomly, especially where the starting binding affinity of the parent antibody is such that such randomly produced antibody mutants can be readily screened.\n\n\nOne useful procedure for generating such antibody mutants is called “alanine scanning mutagenesis” (Cunningham and Wells (1989) \nScience \n244:1081-1085). Here, one or more of the hypervariable region residue(s) are replaced by alanine or polyalanine residue(s) to affect the interaction of the amino acids with the antigen from the second mammalian species. Those hypervariable region residue(s) demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other mutations at or for the sites of substitution. Thus, while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined, the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. The ala-mutants produced this way are screened for their biological activity as described herein.\n\n\nNormally one would start with a conservative substitution such as those shown below under the heading of “preferred substitutions”. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity (e.g. binding affinity), then more substantial changes, denominated “exemplary substitutions” in the following table, or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes, are introduced and the products screened.\n\n\nPreferred Substitutions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOriginal\n\n\nExemplary\n\n\nPreferred\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nResidue\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\nSubstitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla (A)\n\n\nval; leu; ile\n\n\nval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg (R)\n\n\nlys; gln; asn\n\n\nlys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn (N)\n\n\ngln; his; lys; arg\n\n\ngln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp (D)\n\n\nglu\n\n\nglu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys (C)\n\n\nser\n\n\nser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln (Q)\n\n\nasn\n\n\nasn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlu (E)\n\n\nasp\n\n\nasp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly (G)\n\n\npro; ala\n\n\nala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis (H)\n\n\nasn; gln; lys; arg\n\n\narg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle (I)\n\n\nleu; val; met; ala; phe;\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nnorleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu (L)\n\n\nnorleucine; ile; val; met; ala;\n\n\nile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nphe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys (K)\n\n\narg; gln; asn\n\n\narg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet (M)\n\n\nleu; phe; ile\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe (F)\n\n\nleu; val; ile; ala; tyr\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro (P)\n\n\nala\n\n\nala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer (S)\n\n\nthr\n\n\nthr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr (T)\n\n\nser\n\n\nser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp (W)\n\n\ntyr; phe\n\n\ntyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr (Y)\n\n\ntrp; phe; thr; ser\n\n\nphe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal (V)\n\n\nile; leu; met; phe; ala;\n\n\nleu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nnorleucine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven more substantial modifications in the antibodies biological properties are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining (a) the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution, for example, as a sheet or helical conformation, (b) the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site, or (c) the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side-chain properties:\n\n\n(1) hydrophobic: norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile;\n\n\n(2) neutral hydrophilic: cys, ser, thr, asn, gln;\n\n\n(3) acidic: asp, glu;\n\n\n(4) basic: his, lys, arg;\n\n\n(5) residues that influence chain orientation: gly, pro; and\n\n\n(6) aromatic: trp, tyr, phe.\n\n\nNon-conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the sites selected for modification are affinity matured using phage display (see above).\n\n\nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence mutants are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared mutant or a non-mutant version of the parent antibody. The preferred method for making mutants is site directed mutagenesis (see, e.g., Kunkel (1985) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n82:488).\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, the antibody mutant will only have a single hypervariable region residue substituted. In other embodiments, two or more of the hypervariable region residues of the parent antibody will have been substituted, e.g. from about two to about ten hypervariable region substitutions.\n\n\nOrdinarily, the antibody mutant with improved biological properties will have an amino acid sequence having at least 75% amino acid sequence identity or similarity with the amino acid sequence of either the heavy or light chain variable domain of the parent antibody, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or similarity with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical (i.e same residue) or similar (i.e. amino acid residue from the same group based on common side-chain properties, see above) with the parent antibody residues, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence outside of the variable domain shall be construed as affecting sequence identity or similarity.\n\n\nFollowing production of the antibody mutant, the biological activity of that molecule relative to the parent antibody is determined. As noted above, this may involve determining the binding affinity and/or other biological activities of the antibody. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a panel of antibody mutants is prepared and screened for binding affinity for the antigen such as NRP1 or a fragment thereof. One or more of the antibody mutants selected from this initial screen are optionally subjected to one or more further biological activity assays to confirm that the antibody mutant(s) with enhanced binding affinity are indeed useful, e.g. for preclinical studies.\n\n\nThe antibody mutant(s) so selected may be subjected to further modifications, oftentimes depending on the intended use of the antibody. Such modifications may involve further alteration of the amino acid sequence, fusion to heterologous polypeptide(s) and/or covalent modifications such as those elaborated below. With respect to amino acid sequence alterations, exemplary modifications are elaborated above. For example, any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody mutant also may be substituted, generally with serine, to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant cross linking. Conversely, cysteine bond(s) may be added to the antibody to improve its stability (particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment). Another type of amino acid mutant has an altered glycosylation pattern. This may be achieved by deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody, and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody. Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus, the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N-aceylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used. Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The alteration may also be made by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody (for O-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\nVectors, Host Cells and Recombinant Methods\n\n\nThe anti-NRP1 antibody of the invention can be produced recombinantly, using techniques and materials readily obtainable.\n\n\nFor recombinant production of an anti-NRP1 antibody, the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated or synthethized using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to DNAs encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\n(i) Signal Sequence Component\n\n\nThe antibody of this invention may be produced recombinantly not only directly, but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide, which is preferably a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N-terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed (i.e., cleaved by a signal peptidase) by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the native antibody signal sequence, the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected, for example, from the group of the alkaline phosphatase, penicillinase, lpp, or heat-stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the native signal sequence may be substituted by, e.g., the yeast invertase leader, α factor leader (including \nSaccharomyces \nand \nKluyveromyces \nα-factor leaders), or acid phosphatase leader, the \nC. albicans \nglucoamylase leader, or the signal described in WO 90/13646. In mammalian cell expression, mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders, for example, the herpes simplex gD signal, are available.\n\n\nThe DNA for such precursor region is ligated in reading frame to DNA encoding the antibody.\n\n\n(ii) Origin of Replication Component\n\n\nBoth expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Generally, in cloning vectors this sequence is one that enables the vector to replicate independently of the host chromosomal DNA, and includes origins of replication or autonomously replicating sequences. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria, yeast, and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram-negative bacteria, the 2μ plasmid origin is suitable for yeast, and various viral origins (SV40, polyoma, adenovirus, VSV or BPV) are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells. Generally, the origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors (the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter).\n\n\n(iii) Selection Gene Component\n\n\nExpression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene, also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that (a) confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins, e.g., ampicillin, neomycin, methotrexate, or tetracycline, (b) complement auxotrophic deficiencies, or (c) supply critical nutrients not available from complex media, e.g., the gene encoding D-alanine racemase for \nBacilli. \n \n\n\nOne example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin, mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.\n\n\nAnother example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid, such as DHFR, thymidine kinase, metallothionein-I and -II, preferably primate metallothionein genes, adenosine deaminase, ornithine decarboxylase, etc.\n\n\nFor example, cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate (Mtx), a competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild-type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in DHFR activity.\n\n\nAlternatively, host cells (particularly wild-type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR) transformed or co-transformed with DNA sequences encoding antibody, wild-type DHFR protein, and another selectable marker such as \naminoglycoside\n 3′-phosphotransferase (APH) can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic, e.g., kanamycin, neomycin, or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,199.\n\n\nA suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 (Stinchcomb et al. (1979) \nNature \n282:39). The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan, for example, ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4-1. Jones (1977) \nGenetics \n85:12. The presence of the trp1 lesion in the yeast host cell genome then provides an effective environment for detecting transformation by growth in the absence of tryptophan. Similarly, Leu2-deficient yeast strains (ATCC 20,622 or 38,626) are complemented by known plasmids bearing the Leu2 gene.\n\n\nIn addition, vectors derived from the 1.6 μm circular plasmid pKD1 can be used for transformation of \nKluyveromyces \nyeasts. Alternatively, an expression system for large-scale production of recombinant calf chymosin was reported for \nK. lactis\n. Van den Berg (1990) \nBio/Technology \n8:135. Stable multi-copy expression vectors for secretion of mature recombinant human serum albumin by industrial strains of \nKluyveromyces \nhave also been disclosed. Fleer et al. (1991) \nBio/Technology \n9:968-975.\n\n\n(iv) Promoter Component\n\n\nExpression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the antibody nucleic acid. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the phoA promoter, β-lactamase and lactose promoter systems, alkaline phosphatase, a tryptophan (trp) promoter system, and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter. However, other known bacterial promoters are suitable. Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding the antibody.\n\n\nPromoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually all eukaryotic genes have an AT-rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3′ end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3′ end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.\n\n\nExamples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3-phosphoglycerate kinase or other glycolytic enzymes, such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hexokinase, pyruvate decarboxylase, phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, 3-phosphoglycerate mutase, pyruvate kinase, triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglucose isomerase, and glucokinase.\n\n\nOther yeast promoters, which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions, are the promoter regions for \nalcohol dehydrogenase\n 2, isocytochrome C, acid phosphatase, degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism, metallothionein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73,657. Yeast enhancers also are advantageously used with yeast promoters.\n\n\nAntibody transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled, for example, by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus, fowlpox virus, adenovirus (such as Adenovirus 2), bovine papilloma virus, avian sarcoma virus, cytomegalovirus, a retrovirus, hepatitis-B virus and most preferably Simian Virus 40 (SV40), from heterologous mammalian promoters, e.g., the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter, from heat-shock promoters, provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.\n\n\nThe early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,601,978. See also Reyes et al. (1982) \nNature \n297:598-601 on expression of human β-interferon cDNA in mouse cells under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Alternatively, the rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.\n\n\n(v) Enhancer Element Component\n\n\nTranscription of a DNA encoding the antibody of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes (globin, elastase, albumin, α-fetoprotein, and insulin). Typically, however, one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin (bp 100-270), the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer, the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin, and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv (1982) \nNature \n297:17-18 on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a \nposition\n 5′ or 3′ to the antibody-encoding sequence, but is preferably located at a \nsite\n 5′ from the promoter.\n\n\n(vi) Transcription Termination Component\n\n\nExpression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells (yeast, fungi, insect, plant, animal, human, or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms) will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5′ and, occasionally 3′, untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding the antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94/11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.\n\n\n(vii) Selection and Transformation of Host Cells\n\n\nSuitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein are the prokaryote, yeast, or higher eukaryote cells described above. Suitable prokaryotes for this purpose include eubacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, for example, Enterobacteriaceae such as \nEscherichia\n, e.g., \nE. coli, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella\n, e.g., \nSalmonella typhimurium, Serratia\n, e.g., \nSerratia marcescans\n, and \nShigella\n, as well as \nBacilli \nsuch as \nB. subtilis \nand \nB. lichenifonnis \n(e.g., \nB. lichenifonnis \n41P disclosed in DD 266,710 published 12 Apr. 1989), \nPseudomonas \nsuch as \nP. aeruginosa\n, and \nStreptomyces\n. One preferred \nE. coli \ncloning host is \nE. coli \n294 (ATCC 31,446), although other strains such as \nE. coli \nB, \nE. coli \nX1776 (ATCC 31,537), and \nE. coli \nW3110 (ATCC 27,325) are suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting.\n\n\nIn addition to prokaryotes, eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody-encoding vectors. \nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n, or common baker's yeast, is the most commonly used among lower eukaryotic host microorganisms. However, a number of other genera, species, and strains are commonly available and useful herein, such as \nSchizosaccharomyces pombe; Kluyveromyces \nhosts such as, e.g., \nK. lactis, K. fragilis \n(ATCC 12,424), \nK. bulgaricus \n(ATCC 16,045), \nK. wickeramii \n(ATCC 24,178), \nK. waltii \n(ATCC 56,500), \nK. drosophilarum \n(ATCC 36,906), \nK. thermotolerans\n, and \nK. marxianus; yarrowia \n(EP 402,226); \nPichia pastoris \n(EP 183,070); \nCandida; Trichoderma reesia \n(EP 244,234); \nNeurospora crassa; Schwanniomyces \nsuch as \nSchwanniomyces occidentalis\n; and filamentous fungi such as, e.g., \nNeurospora, Penicillium, Tolypocladium\n, and \nAspergillus \nhosts such as \nA. nidulans \nand \nA. niger. \n \n\n\nSuitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antibody are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include plant and insect cells. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as \nSpodoptera frugiperda \n(caterpillar), \nAedes aegypti \n(mosquito), \nAedes albopictus \n(mosquito), \nDrosophila melanogaster \n(fruitfly), and \nBombyx mori \nhave been identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available, e.g., the L-1 variant of \nAutographa californica \nNPV and the Bm-5 strain of \nBombyx mori \nNPV, and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention, particularly for transfection of \nSpodoptera frugiperda \ncells. Plant cell cultures of cotton, corn, potato, soybean, petunia, tomato, and tobacco can also be utilized as hosts.\n\n\nHowever, interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells, and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture (tissue culture) has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 (COS-7, ATCC CRL 1651); human embryonic kidney line (293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture, Graham et al. (1977) \nJ. Gen Virol. \n36:59); baby hamster kidney cells (BHK, ATCC CCL 10); Chinese hamster ovary cells/−DHFR (CHO, Urlaub et al. (1980) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n77:4216); mouse sertoli cells (TM4, Mather (1980) \nBiol Reprod. \n23:243-251); monkey kidney cells (CV1 ATCC CCL 70); African green monkey kidney cells (VERO-76, ATCC CRL-1587); human cervical carcinoma cells (HELA, ATCC CCL 2); canine kidney cells (MDCK, ATCC CCL 34); buffalo rat liver cells (BRL 3A, ATCC CRL 1442); human lung cells (\nWI\n 38, ATCC CCL 75); human liver cells (Hep G2, HB 8065); mouse mammary tumor (MMT 060562, ATCC CCL51); TRI cells (Mather et al. (1982) \nAnnals N.Y. Acad. Sci. \n383:44-68); \nMRC\n 5 cells; FS4 cells; and a human hepatoma line (Hep G2).\n\n\nHost cells are transformed with the above-described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters, selecting transformants, or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.\n\n\n(viii) Culturing the Host Cells\n\n\nThe host cells used to produce the antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ((MEM), (Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma), and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ((DMEM), Sigma) are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition, any of the media described in Ham et al. (1979) \nMeth. Enz. \n58:44, Barnes et al. (1980) \nAnal. Biochem. \n102:255, U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,704; 4,657,866; 4,927,762; 4,560,655; or 5,122,469; WO 90/03430; WO 87/00195; or U.S. Pat. Re. 30,985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors (such as insulin, transferrin, or epidermal growth factor), salts (such as sodium chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers (such as HEPES), nucleotides (such as adenosine and thymidine), antibiotics (such as GENTAMYCIN™drug), trace elements (defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range), and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH, and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.\n\n\n(ix) Antibody Purification\n\n\nWhen using recombinant techniques, the antibody can be produced intracellularly, in the periplasmic space, or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly, as a first step, the particulate debris, either host cells or lysed fragments, is removed, for example, by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al. (1992) \nBio/Technology \n10:163-167 describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of \nE. coli\n. Briefly, cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate (pH 3.5), EDTA, and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium, supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter, for example, an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.\n\n\nThe antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using, for example, hydroxylapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, and affinity chromatography, with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human γ1, γ2, or γ4 heavy chains (Lindmark et al. (1983) \nJ. Immunol. Meth. \n62:1-13). Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human γ3 (Guss et al. (1986) \nEMBO J. \n5:15671575). The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose, but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly(styrenedivinyl)benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a \nC\n \n \n \nH\n3 domain, the Bakerbond ABX™resin (J. T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion-exchange column, ethanol precipitation, Reverse Phase HPLC, chromatography on silica, chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE™ chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin (such as a polyaspartic acid column), chromatofocusing, SDS-PAGE, and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.\n\n\nFollowing any preliminary purification step(s), the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5-4.5, preferably performed at low salt concentrations (e.g., from about 0-0.25M salt).\n\n\nPharmaceutical Formulations\n\n\nTherapeutic formulations of the antibody are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers (\nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980)), in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed, and include buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptide; proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugars such as sucrose, mannitol, trehalose or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g., Zn-protein complexes); and/or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™, PLURONICS™ or polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\nThe formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated, preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example, it may be desirable to further provide an immunosuppressive agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.\n\n\nThe active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsule and poly-(methylmethacylate) microcapsule, respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules) or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \n16th edition, Osol, A. Ed. (1980).\n\n\nThe formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.\n\n\nSustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g., films, or microcapsule. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and γ ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37° C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S—S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilizing from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.\n\n\nTherapeutic Uses\n\n\nIt is contemplated that the antibody of the present invention may be used to treat a mammal. In one embodiment, the antibody is administered to a nonhuman mammal for the purposes of obtaining preclinical data, for example. Exemplary nonhuman mammals to be treated include nonhuman primates, dogs, cats, rodents and other mammals in which preclinical studies are performed. Such mammals may be established animal models for a disease to be treated with the antibody or may be used to study toxicity of the antibody of interest. In each of these embodiments, dose escalation studies may be performed in the mammal. Where the antibody is an anti-NRP1 antibody, it may be administered to a host rodent in a solid tumor model, for example.\n\n\nIn addition, or in the alternative, the antibody is used to treat a human, e.g. a patient suffering from a disease or disorder who could benefit from administration of the antibody.\n\n\nThe present invention encompasses antiangiogenic cancer therapy, a novel cancer treatment strategy aimed at inhibiting the development of tumor blood vessels required for providing nutrients to support tumor growth. Because angiogenesis is involved in both primary tumor growth and metastasis, the antiangiogenic treatment provided by the invention is capable of inhibiting the neoplastic growth of tumor at the primary site as well as preventing metastasis of tumors at the secondary sites, therefore allowing attack of the tumors by other therapeutics. Examples of cancer to be treated herein include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, lung cancer (including small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma of the lung, and squamous carcinoma of the lung), cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer (including gastrointestinal cancer), pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, liver cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma and various types of head and neck cancer, as well as B-cell lymphoma (including low grade/follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL); small lymphocytic (SL) NHL; intermediate grade/follicular NHL; intermediate grade diffuse NHL; high grade immunoblastic NHL; high grade lymphoblastic NHL; high grade small non-cleaved cell NHL; bulky disease NHL; mantle cell lymphoma; AIDS-related lymphoma; and Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia); chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); Hairy cell leukemia; chronic myeloblastic leukemia; and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), as well as abnormal vascular proliferation associated with phakomatoses, edema (such as that associated with brain tumors), and Meigs' syndrome. More particularly, cancers that are amenable to treatment by the antibodies of the invention include breast cancer, colorectal cancer, rectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), renal cell cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, soft-tissue sarcoma, kaposi's sarcoma, carcinoid carcinoma, head and neck cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, mesothelioma, and multiple myeloma. More preferably, the methods of the invention are used to treat colorectal cancer in a human patient.\n\n\nIt is contemplated that when used to treat various diseases such as tumors, the antibodies of the invention can be combined with other therapeutic agents suitable for the same or similar diseases. When used for treating cancer, antibodies of the present invention may be used in combination with conventional cancer therapies, such as surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or combinations thereof.\n\n\nIn certain aspects, other therapeutic agents useful for combination cancer therapy with the antibody of the invention include other anti-angiogenic agents. Many anti-angiogenic agents have been identified and are known in the arts, including those listed by Carmeliet and Jain (2000).\n\n\nIn one aspect, the antibody of the invention is used in combination with a VEGF antagonist or a VEGF receptor antagonist such as anti-VEGF antibodies, VEGF variants, soluble VEGF receptor fragments, aptamers capable of blocking VEGF or VEGFR, neutralizing anti-VEGFR antibodies, inhibitors of VEGFR tyrosine kinases and any combinations thereof. Alternatively, or in addition, two or more anti-NRP1 antibodies may be co-administered to the patient. In a more preferred embodiment, the anti-NRP1\nA \nor anti-NRP\nB \nantibody of the invention is used in combination with an anti-VEGF antibody to generate additive or synergistic effects. Preferred anti-VEGF antibodies include those that bind to the same epitope as the anti-hVEGF antibody A4.6.1. More preferably the anti-VEGF antibody is bevacizumab or ranibizumab.\n\n\nIn some other aspects, other therapeutic agents useful for combination tumor therapy with the antibody of the invention include antagonist of other factors that are involved in tumor growth, such as EGFR, ErbB2 (also known as Her2) ErbB3, ErbB4, or TNF. Preferably, the anti-NRP1 antibody of the invention can be used in combination with small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) that target one or more tyrosine kinase receptors such as VEGF receptors, FGF receptors, EGF receptors and PDGF receptors. Many therapeutic small molecule RTKIs are known in the art, including, but are not limited to, vatalanib (PTK787), erlotinib (TARCEVA®), OSI-7904, ZD6474 (ZACTIMA®), ZD6126 (ANG453), ZD1839, sunitinib (SUTENT®), semaxanib (SU5416), AMG706, AG013736, Imatinib (GLEEVEC®), MLN-518, CEP-701, PKC-412, Lapatinib (GSK572016), VELCADE®, AZD2171, sorafenib (NEXAVAR®), XL880, and CHIR-265.\n\n\nThe anti-NRP1 antibody of the invention, either alone or in combination with a second therapeutic agent (such as an anti-VEGF antibody) can be further used in combination with one or more chemotherapeutic agents. A variety of chemotherapeutic agents may be used in the combined treatment methods of the invention. An exemplary and non-limiting list of chemotherapeutic agents contemplated is provided herein under “Definition”.\n\n\nWhen the anti-NRP1 antibody is co-administered with a second therapeutic agent, the second therapeutic agent may be administered first, followed by the anti-NRP1 antibody. However, simultaneous administration or administration of the anti-NRP1 antibody first is also contemplated. Suitable dosages for the second therapeutic agent are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the agent and anti-NRP1 antibody.\n\n\nFor the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of antibody will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments.\n\n\nDepending on the type and severity of the disease, about 1 μg/kg to 50 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1-20 mg/kg) of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 μg/kg to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. In a preferred aspect, the antibody of the invention is administered every two to three weeks, at a dose ranged from about 5 mg/kg to about 15 mg/kg. More preferably, such dosing regimen is used in combination with a chemotherapy regimen as the first line therapy for treating metastatic colorectal cancer. In some aspects, the chemotherapy regimen involves the traditional high-dose intermittent administration. In some other aspects, the chemotherapeutic agents are administered using smaller and more frequent doses without scheduled breaks (“metronomic chemotherapy”). The progress of the therapy of the invention is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.\n\n\nThe antibody composition will be formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular mammal being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The “therapeutically effective amount” of the antibody to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat a disease or disorder. The antibody need not be, but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibody present in the formulation, the type of disorder or treatment, and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99% of the heretofore employed dosages. Generally, alleviation or treatment of a disease or disorder involves the lessening of one or more symptoms or medical problems associated with the disease or disorder. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug can accomplish one or a combination of the following: reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., to decrease to some extent and/or stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. In some embodiments, a composition of this invention can be used to prevent the onset or reoccurrence of the disease or disorder in a subject or mammal.\n\n\nNon-Therapeutic Uses\n\n\nThe antibodies of the invention may be used as affinity purification agents. In this process, the antibodies are immobilized on a solid phase such a Sephadex resin or filter paper, using methods well known in the art. The immobilized antibody is contacted with a sample containing the antigen to be purified, and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except the antigen to be purified, which is bound to the immobilized antibody. Finally, the support is washed with another suitable solvent, such as glycine buffer, pH 5.0, that will release the antigen from the antibody.\n\n\nThe antibodies of this invention may also be useful in diagnostic assays, e.g., for detecting expression of an antigen of interest in specific cells, tissues, or serum.\n\n\nFor diagnostic applications, the antibody typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety. Numerous labels are available which can be generally grouped into the following categories:\n\n\n(a) Radioisotopes, such as \n35\nS, \n14\nC, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, and \n131\nI. The antibody can be labeled with the radioisotope using the techniques described in \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology\n, \n \nVolumes\n \n 1 and 2, Coligen et al. (1991) Ed. Wiley-Interscience, New York, N.Y., Pubs. for example and radioactivity can be measured using scintillation counting.\n\n\n(b) Fluorescent labels such as rare earth chelates (europium chelates) or fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, dansyl, Lissamine, phycoerythrin and Texas Red are available. The fluorescent labels can be conjugated to the antibody using the techniques disclosed in \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology\n, supra, for example. Fluorescence can be quantified using a fluorimeter.\n\n\n(c) Various enzyme-substrate labels are available and U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,149 provides a review of some of these. The enzyme generally catalyzes a chemical alteration of the chromogenic substrate which can be measured using various techniques. For example, the enzyme may catalyze a color change in a substrate, which can be measured spectrophotometrically. Alternatively, the enzyme may alter the fluorescence or chemiluminescence of the substrate. Techniques for quantifying a change in fluorescence are described above. The chemiluminescent substrate becomes electronically excited by a chemical reaction and may then emit light which can be measured (using a chemiluminometer, for example) or donates energy to a fluorescent acceptor. Examples of enzymatic labels include luciferases (e.g., firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase; U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,456), luciferin, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, malate dehydrogenase, urease, peroxidase such as horseradish peroxidase (HRPO), alkaline phosphatase, β-galactosidase, glucoamylase, lysozyme, saccharide oxidases (e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), heterocyclic oxidases (such as uricase and xanthine oxidase), lactoperoxidase, microperoxidase, and the like. Techniques for conjugating enzymes to antibodies are described in O'Sullivan et al. (1981) Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme-Antibody Conjugates for use in Enzyme Immunoassay, in \nMethods in Enzym\n. (ed J. Langone & H. Van Vunakis), Academic press, New York 73:147-166.\n\n\nExamples of enzyme-substrate combinations include, for example:\n\n\n(i) Horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) with hydrogen peroxidase as a substrate, wherein the hydrogen peroxidase oxidizes a dye precursor (e.g., orthophenylene diamine (OPD) or 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine hydrochloride (TMB));\n\n\n(ii) alkaline phosphatase (AP) with para-Nitrophenyl phosphate as chromogenic substrate; and\n\n\n(iii) β-D-galactosidase (β-D-Gal) with a chromogenic substrate (e.g., p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactosidase) or fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-galactosidase.\n\n\nNumerous other enzyme-substrate combinations are available to those skilled in the art. For a general review of these, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,275,149 and 4,318,980.\n\n\nSometimes, the label is indirectly conjugated with the antibody. The skilled artisan will be aware of various techniques for achieving this. For example, the antibody can be conjugated with biotin and any of the three broad categories of labels mentioned above can be conjugated with avidin, or vice versa. Biotin binds selectively to avidin and thus, the label can be conjugated with the antibody in this indirect manner. Alternatively, to achieve indirect conjugation of the label with the antibody, the antibody is conjugated with a small hapten (e.g., digoxin) and one of the different types of labels mentioned above is conjugated with an anti-hapten antibody (e.g., anti-digoxin antibody). Thus, indirect conjugation of the label with the antibody can be achieved.\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the invention, the antibody need not be labeled, and the presence thereof can be detected using a labeled antibody which binds to the antibody.\n\n\nThe antibodies of the present invention may be employed in any known assay method, such as competitive binding assays, direct and indirect sandwich assays, and immunoprecipitation assays. Zola, \nMonoclonal Antibodies: A Manual of Techniques\n, pp. 147-158 (CRC Press, Inc. 1987).\n\n\nCompetitive binding assays rely on the ability of a labeled standard to compete with the test sample analyze for binding with a limited amount of antibody. The amount of antigen in the test sample is inversely proportional to the amount of standard that becomes bound to the antibodies. To facilitate determining the amount of standard that becomes bound, the antibodies generally are insolubilized before or after the competition, so that the standard and analyze that are bound to the antibodies may conveniently be separated from the standard and analyze which remain unbound.\n\n\nSandwich assays involve the use of two antibodies, each capable of binding to a different immunogenic portion, or epitope, of the protein to be detected. In a sandwich assay, the test sample analyze is bound by a first antibody which is immobilized on a solid support, and thereafter a second antibody binds to the analyze, thus forming an insoluble three-part complex. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110. The second antibody may itself be labeled with a detectable moiety (direct sandwich assays) or may be measured using an anti-immunoglobulin antibody that is labeled with a detectable moiety (indirect sandwich assay). For example, one type of sandwich assay is an ELISA assay, in which case the detectable moiety is an enzyme.\n\n\nFor immunohistochemistry, the tumor sample may be fresh or frozen or may be embedded in paraffin and fixed with a preservative such as formalin, for example.\n\n\nThe antibodies may also be used for in vivo diagnostic assays. Generally, the antibody is labeled with a radionuclide (such as \n111\nIn, \n99\nTc, \n14\nC, \n131\nI, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, \n32\nP or \n35\nS) or a dye so that the tumor can be localized using immunoscintiography.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a method of detecting NRP1 in a biological sample (e.g., tissue, blood, sera, spinal fluid) or a prepared biological sample can comprise the step of contacting an antibody of this invention with the sample and observing the anti-NRP1 antibody bound to the NRP1 in the sample or determining the amount of the anti-NRP1 antibody bound to NRP1 in the sample. In another embodiment, a method of detecting NRP1 in a subject comprises the step of administering an antibody of this invention to the subject and observing the anti-NRP1 antibody bound to the NRP1 in the subject or determining the amount of the anti-NRP1 antibody bound to NRP1 in the subject (e.g., human, mouse, rabbit, rat, etc).\n\n\nDiagnostic Kits\n\n\nAs a matter of convenience, the antibody of the present invention can be provided in a kit, i.e., a packaged combination of reagents in predetermined amounts with instructions for performing the diagnostic assay. Where the antibody is labeled with an enzyme, the kit will include substrates and cofactors required by the enzyme (e.g., a substrate precursor which provides the detectable chromophore or fluorophore). In addition, other additives may be included such as stabilizers, buffers (e.g., a block buffer or lysis buffer) and the like. The relative amounts of the various reagents may be varied widely to provide for concentrations in solution of the reagents which substantially optimize the sensitivity of the assay. Particularly, the reagents may be provided as dry powders, usually lyophilized, including excipients which on dissolution will provide a reagent solution having the appropriate concentration.\n\n\nArticles of Manufacture\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the invention, an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment of the disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a container and a label. Suitable containers include, for example, bottles, vials, syringes, and test tubes. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a composition which is effective for treating the condition and may have a sterile access port (for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle). The active agent in the composition is the antibody. The label on, or associated with, the container indicates that the composition is used for treating the condition of choice. The article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable buffer, such as phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer's solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint, including other buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and package inserts with instructions for use.\n\n\nThe following examples are intended merely to illustrate the practice of the present invention and are not provided by way of limitation. The disclosures of all patent and scientific literatures cited herein are expressly incorporated in their entirety by reference.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nGeneration of Anti-NRP1 Antibodies\n\n\nA. Generation of Antibody Phage Libraries\n\n\nA variety of methods are known in the art for generating antibody libraries displayed on phage or displayed using other technologies. One of the advantages of these libraries, as compared to conventional hybridoma technologies, is that they are well suited for generating cross-species functional antibodies, because they allow in vitro selection and screening without the introduction of immune tolerance. Smith (1985) \nScience \n228:1315-1317; Bradbury and Marks (2004) \nJ Immunol Methods \n290:29-49.\n\n\nIn general, two types of combinatorial antibody libraries have been developed, distinguished by the source of repertoires. Most libraries to date are “natural” antibody libraries which use the natural repertoires as the source for its diversity, where the genes as message RNA of immune cells from naïve or immunized animals or human are amplified and cloned into vector for phage display or other display technology, such as ribosome or yeast display. The natural antibodies usually have multiple frameworks, which together with variable CDRs sequences and the recombination of light chain and heavy chain made up the diversity of the library. The size of the library determines the performance of the libraries since the repertoires are in general larger than the library size. The synthetic library, on the other hand, is a new branch of library where the diversity is designed and built into the library with synthetic DNA. Single or multiple frameworks have been used. For single framework library, the source of the diversity solely depends on the degeneracy of synthetic DNA designed to create the diverse CDR loops. Both the diversity design and the size of the libraries are critical for the library performance, which can be measured by the affinity of the antibodies found from the libraries. Knappik et al. (2000) \nJ Mol Biol \n296:57-86; Sheets et al. (1998) \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n95: 6157-6162; de Haard et al. (1999) \nJ Biol Chem \n274:18218-18230.\n\n\nBy introducing synthetic diversity at solvent-exposed positions within the variable heavy chain complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), Lee et al. developed a phage-displayed synthetic antibody library built on a single human framework (VL\nkappa I\n, VH\nsubgroup III\n). Sidhu et al. (2004) \nJ Mol Biol \n338:299-310; Lee et al. (2004) \nJ Mol Biol \n340:1073-1093; Carter et al. (1992) \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n89:4285-4289. This “VH library” was displayed as a bivalent antigen-binding fragment (Fab′2) and used tailored codons to mimic the natural diversity observed in human immunoglobulin. Lee et al. (2004) \nJ Immunol Methods \n284:119-132. While the VH library has performed well as measured by the affinity and function of derived antibodies, further modifications in library design can be desirable in generating functional antibodies of certain antigen targets of interest. The recent availability of trinucleotides for oligonucleotide synthesis enabled the ability to increase amino acid diversity without increasing DNA diversity. A new “VH/VL library” was thus generated as described herein, wherein the highly variable positions in CDR-L3 were further diversified, since CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 form the inner sphere of the antigen-binding site. Mian et al. (1991) \nJ Mol Biol \n217:133-151.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nThe VH/VL naïve library template with consensus CDR-L1, -L2, -L3, -H1 and -H2 was generated using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis on phagemid pV0350-4 with stop codons on CDR-H3 and displaying bivalently on the surfaces of M13 bacteriophage particles. Lee et al. (2004) \nJ Mol Biol \n340:1073-1093. Phage-displayed libraries were constructed using Kunkel mutagenesis method as described (Kunkel et al. (1991) \nMethods Enzymol \n204:125-139), with a mixture of mutagenic oligonucleotides designed to introduce mutations at the designed sites in CDR-L3, H1, H2 and H3 and repair CDR-H3 stop codons. The mutagenesis reactions (˜10 μg DNA) were electroporated into \nE. coli \nSS320 cells (˜10\n11 \ncells), as described (Sidhu et al. (2004)).\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe VH/VL library described here utilized the Herceptin® derived VL\nkappa I \nand VH\nsubgroup III \nframework as used for the VH library, which has been shown to display well on bacteriophage, express well in \nE. coli\n, and which can rapidly be converted to a full length IgG that expresses well in mammalian cells. Lee et al. (2004) \nJ Mol Biol \n340:1073-1093; Carter et al. (1992) \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n89:4285-4289. The libraries were displayed on the phage surface as a bivalent Fab (Fab′\n2\n) by being fused to the phage coat protein P3. This bivalent display was intended to increase the apparent binding affinities to immobilized antigens and help to improve the recovery of rare or low-affinity phage antibody clones.\n\n\nTo avoid potential biases inherited from the Herceptin®-derived CDR sequences maintained in the light chain of the VH library, consensus kappa I CDR sequences were introduced into the template for the VH/VL library. Consensus CDR residues are determined by selecting the most prevalent amino acids existing in natural human antibodies. The stop codons, previously employed in the heavy chain of the VH library to ensure mutagenesis in all 3 CDRs, were similarly replaced with consensus subgroup III sequences for CDR-H1 and CDR-H2. The consensus CDR sequences represent the most prevalent amino acid in each position. CDR-H3 plays a dominant role in antigen recognition, thus several stop codons were placed in H3 to ensure functional antibody clones from the libraries were different from each other. Xu et al. (2000) \nImmunity \n13: 37-45. The presence of human consensus CDR sequences was expected to allow partially mutated variants (not all targeted CDRs are changed) to be displayed and to remain potentially functional in binding. In this way the VH/VL design has the advantage of increasing the ratio of functional phage antibody clones in the library. The CDR sequences used were SISSYL for CDR-L1 (positions 28-33), GASSRA for CDR-L2 (positions 50-55), YYSSPL for CDR-L3 (positions 91-96), FTFSSYAMS for CDR-H1 (positions 27-35), and RISPSGGSTY for CDR-H2 (positions 50-58), and WXXXRPXXMDY for CDR-H3 (positions 95-102, X is a stop codon) as shown in Table I. The prevalence of each position in human antibodies is also shown in Table I.\n\n\nDiversity in the VH/VL library was introduced into a subset of CDR positions based on their high solvent exposure and/or especially high variability among natural antibody sequences. Positions chosen for mutagenesis and the diversity that was introduced are shown in Table II. For example, in CDR-H1, \n \n \n \n \n \n \nposition\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34 were chosen to diversify. For the VH/VL library design, degenerate oligo codons or trinucletides were used to guide the diversity in each position so that the most prevalent amino acids would be represented. For example in CDR-H1 (position 30), serine represents about 50% of natural diversity, so a mixture of trinucletides (X1) that have ca. 52% serine and 2.5% of other amino acids except cysteine was used.\n\n\nCDR-H3 and CDR-L3 form the center of the antigen-binding site and therefore show the highest frequency of antigen contacts in structurally known antibody-antigen complexes. Chothia et al. (1989) \nNature \n342:877-883. Five residues in CDR-L3 (Table II) with the highest variability were randomized. Overall CDR-H3 is the most diverse in terms of length, sequence, and structure and is a key component of the diversity in natural antibodies. Xu and Davis (2000) \nImmunity \n13:37-45; Wu et al. (1993) \nProteins \n16:1-7. Thus 12 sub-libraries were constructed with different CDR-H3 lengths varying from 9 to 20 amino acids. Combined, these sub-libraries cover approximately 90% of CDR-H3 length variation in natural antibodies. Oligonucleotides encoding CDR-H3 were synthesized using trinucleotide codons. This enabled us to easily delete cysteine (rare in CDR-H3), and to boost levels of glycine, tyrosine and serine, the most abundant residues in CDR-H3. Mian et al. (1991) \nJ Mol Biol \n217:133-151. Codon X7, a trinucleotide mixture of about 15.6% each serine, tyrosine, and glycine, with 3.1% each of the remaining amino acids except cysteine, was used for each position in CDR-H3 (theoretical calculations for all trinucleotides mixture). Different combinations of trinucleotides were also used in selected positions of CDR-H1, H2, H3, and L3. As shown in Table II and Supplemental Table I, Codons X1 to X6 have a high percentage of serine, tyrosine, or glycine. X1 has 52.5% of serine, X2 has 52.5% tyrosine, X3 has 10% tyrosine, glycine or serine, X4 has 28.8% glycine, X5 has 19.2% tyrosine, glycine or serine, and X6 has 20% tyrosine or serine. The VH/VL antibody phage library was estimated to have approximately 10\n10 \nvariants displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsensus sequence of CDR-L1, CDR-L2, CDR-L3, CDR-H1 and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR-H2 in the template of VH/VL library.

Generation of Phage-Derived Monoclonal Anti-NRP1 Antibodies\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\n\nLibrary sorting and screening to identify anti NRP1 antibodies—Human and murine NRP1 constructs (1-641aa) were cloned into mammalian expression vector, and expressed in CHO cells. Truncated form of NRP-1, a1a2 and b1b2 domains, were expressed in baculovirus. \nNUNC\n 96 well Maxisorp immunoplates were coated overnight at 4° with target antigen (10 ug/ml) and were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature with phage blocking buffer PBST (PBS and 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20). The antibody phage libraries were added to antigen plates and incubated overnight at RT. The following day antigen-coated plates were washed 10 times with PBT (PBS with 0.05% T-20), and bound phage were eluted with 50 mM HCl and 500 mM NaCl for 30 minutes and neutralized with equal volume of 1M Tris base pH7.5. Recovered phage was amplified in \nE. coli \nXL-1 Blue cells. During the subsequent selection rounds, incubation of antibody phage with the antigen-coated plates was reduced to 2-3 hours, and the stringency of plate washing was gradually increased.\n\n\nAnti-NRP1 antibodies binding affinities, specificity and flow cytometry analysis—Phage antibody IC\n50 \nvalues were determined using competitive phage-binding ELISA as described. Lee et al. (2004) \nJ Mol Biol \n340:1073-1093. Competition curves were fit with a four-parameter non-linear regression curve-fitting program (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software) to determine the IC\n50 \nvalues which were calculated as the concentration of antigen in solution binding stage that inhibited 50% of the phage-displayed antibody from binding to immobilized antigen.\n\n\nClones of interest were then reformatted into IgGs by cloning V\nL \nand V\nH \nregion of individual clones into LPG3 and LPG4 vector respectively (Carter et al. (1992) \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n89:4285-4289), transiently expressed in mammalian cells, and purified with protein A columns. For binding affinity determinations of anti-NRP1 IgGs, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) measurement with a BIAcore™-3000 instrument was used. Anti-NRP1 IgGs were coupled to activated CM5 biosensor chips to achieve approximately 500 response units (RU), followed by blocking un-reacted groups with 1M ethanolamine. For kinetic measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Neuropilin (0.7 to 500 nM) were injected in PBST buffer at 25° C. with a flow rate of 30 μl/min. Association rates (k\non\n) and dissociation rates (k\noff\n) were calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated as the ratio k\noff\n/k\non\n.\n\n\nFor binding specificity tests, 10 μg/ml of IgGs in PBST buffer was incubated with 2 μg/ml antigen-coated 96-well Maxisorp plates for at least 1 hr, and the plates were washed with PBT buffer. Bound antibodies were detected with anti-human antibody HRP conjugates, developed with TMB substrate for approximately 5 minutes, quenched with 1M H\n3\nPO\n4\n, and read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm.\n\n\nFor flow cytometry analysis, HUVEC cells were detached from the tissue culture flasks with cell dissociation buffer. Dissociated cells were washed in PBS and re-suspended in PBS containing 2% Fetal Bovine Serum (FACS buffer). Cells were incubated with 10 ug/ml anti-NRP1 antibodies or control antibody (anti-IgE) in FACS buffer on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed twice in PBS, and stained in FACS buffer with PE-Fab′\n2 \ngoat anti-human IgG, Fc specific antibody on ice for 30 minutes. Following two PBS washes, the cells were re-suspended in 200 μl FACS buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS caliber, Benton Dickenson, Mountain View, Calif.) using Cell-Quest software.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThe 12 VH/VL sub-libraries were individually panned against immobilized CHO cell expressed hNRP1 (a1a2b1b2)-Fc protein for the first round of selection. Eluted phages from each sub-library were amplified and then combined for second round of selection. Since hNRP1-Fc was used as the antigen, the pooled phage was pre-absorbed with excess irrelevant Fc fusion protein after the first round of panning to minimize the recovery of anti-Fc phage antibodies. After the fourth round of panning, 95 randomly picked phage clones were evaluated for the ability to specifically bind to NRP1. Ninety percent of clones were positive for hNRP1 binding and 40% of positive clones bound both human and murine NRP1.\n\n\nThese phage clones were sequenced, and 10 unique clones were chosen for further characterization. All bound to both human and murine NRP1 with an IC\n50 \nbelow 70 nM in the phage ELISA. Clone YW64.3 bound human and murine NRP1 with an IC\n50 \nof 0.5 and 3.4 nM, respectively (Table III). Sequences from the 10 clones reflect the VH/VL library design with variable CDR-H3 lengths and varied changes distributed throughout CDR-H1, H2 and L3 yet some consensus CDR sequences from the library template are retained. Clones 64.3 and 64.29 have changes in all 4 CDRs and also have the best binding affinities to both human and murine NRP1 (Table III).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE III\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartial CDR sequences and binding affinity (phage IC50) for anti-NRP1 antibodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly CDR amino acid sequences at randomized positions of 11 different phage clones\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitially identified from VH/VL library are shown.

To select phage antibodies that bound to the b1b2 domain of NRP1 and potentially block the binding of VEGF, we initiated a new panning process using baculovirus expressed hNRP1 (b1b2)-His as an immobilized antigen. Following 4 rounds of selection, only one unique clone, YW107.4 was identified that bound both human and murine NRP1. YW107.4 bound to human and murine NRP1 with an IC\n50 \nof 6 and 38 nM in the Phage ELISA (Table III).\n\n\nCharacterization of selected anti-NRP1 IgG—Selected anti-NRP1 clones from Table III were reformatted into full length human IgG1, expressed in CHO cells and purified for further characterization. The anti-NRP1 phage antibodies YW64.3 and YW107.4 bound specifically to human and murine NRP1 and did not bind to human or murine NRP-2, ErbB2-ECD or BSA. \nFIG. 1A\n. Each of the other eight-phage antibodies showed similar specificity. By surface plasmon resonance, immobilized YW64.3 and YW107.4 IgG did not interact with these antigens at concentrations up to 500 nM. However, both YW64.3 and YW107.4 bound human NRP1 with a Kd of 0.9 and 5 nM as well as murine NRP1 with a Kd of 7.8 and 11 nM, respectively. Although these antibodies were selected using plate-immobilized antigen, FACS analysis demonstrated all purified IgGs also bound to HUVEC cells which express hNRP1 endogenously (e.g. YW64.3 and YW107.4 shown in \nFIG. 1B\n).\n\n\nC. Affinity Maturation of Anti-NRP1 Antibodies\n\n\nYW107.4 bound to the b1b2 domain of both human and murine NRP1 with a phage IC\n50 \nof 6 and 38 nM, respectively (Table III). To improve potency in vivo, this clone was affinity-matured using human NRP1-His.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nTo generate the library template for affinity maturation of clone YW107.4, the GCN4 leucine zipper of the parental phagemid was first removed using Kunkel mutagenesis to provide a monovalent display Fab format. A stop codon was incorporated in CDR-L3. A soft randomization strategy was used for affinity maturation, which introduced the mutation rate of approximately 50% at the selected positions by the mutagenic DNA synthesizing with 70-10-10-10 mixtures of bases favoring the wild type nucleotides. Gallop et al. (1994) \nJ Med Chem \n37:1233-1251. Three different libraries with combinations of CDR loops, L1/L2/L3, L3/H1/H2 and L3/H3 randomization, were generated through soft randomizing selected residues at positions 28-32 of CDR-L1, 50 and 53-55 of CDR-L2, 91, 92, 93, 94 and 96 of CDR-L3, 28-35 of CDR-H1, 50-58 of CDR-H2, and 95-100 of CDR-H3.\n\n\nFor selecting affinity-matured clones, phage libraries were subjected to plate sorting for the first round and followed by four rounds of solution phase sorting as described. Lee et al. (2004) \nJ Mol Biol \n340:1073-1093. At the first round of plate sorting, three libraries were added to hNRP1-coated plate separately for 1 hr at 37° C. After that, four rounds of solution phase sorting were performed to enhance the efficiency of affinity-based selection with increasing stringency as follow: round 2 (5 nM biotinylated hNRP1), round 3 (1 nM biotinylated hNRP1), round 4 (0.5 nM biotinylated hNRP1 and 250 nM non-biotinylated hNRP1 competitor at 37° C. for 1 hr) and round 5 (0.5 nM biotinylated hNRP1 and 500 nM non-biotinylated hNRP1 competitor at 37° C. for 3 hr). During the selection process, the reaction without biotinylated hNRP1 was included and served as background phage binding for calculating the enrichment of each round of panning.\n\n\nAfter five rounds of panning, a high-throughput single-point competitive phage ELISA was used to rapidly screen for high-affinity clones as described. Sidhu et al. (2004) \nJ Mol Biol \n338:299-310. Clones with low ratio of the absorbance at 450 nm in the presence of 5 nM hNRP1 to that in the absence of hNRP1 were chosen for further characterization.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nThree different CDR combinations, L1/L2/L3, L3/H1/H2 and L3/H3, were targeted for randomization using a ‘soft randomization’ strategy that maintains a wild-type sequence bias such that selected positions are mutated only 50 percent of the time. Gallop et al. (1994) \nJ Med Chem \n37:1233-1251. For affinity maturation, the monovalent Fab was displayed on phage rather than bi-valent Fab to reduce potential avidity during selection. Stop codons were introduced at CDR-L3 in each sub-library. Off-rate selection strategies (see Methods) were employed to improve the affinity of YW107.4, since it already possessed a relatively high association rate constant. (2.2×10\n5\n), but the dissociation rate constant (1.1×10\n−3\n) was relatively fast (Table V).\n\n\nIn the first round of selection, all 3 CDR soft-randomized libraries were panned against immobilized hNRP1 followed by subsequent rounds with a solution-phase sorting strategy to limit target concentration and enhance affinity-based selection. The concentration of biotinylated-hNRP1 was gradually reduced from 5 to 0.5 nM and a 500-fold excess of non-biotinylated hNRP1 was added to compete for fast off-rate binders. The mixture was also incubated at 37° C. for up to 2 hrs.\n\n\nThe L1/L2/L3 library showed significant \nenrichment following round\n 5. Ninety-six clones were randomly picked, sequenced and then affinities ranked. Twenty-three unique phage clones were selected and purified for further characterization. Most clones had improved affinity for hNRP1 as determined by phage competition ELISA. Surprisingly, the affinity for mNRP1 was also improved despite being omitted from the selection process, suggesting that the clones bound to a conserved epitope. Selected clones had 4 to 7 changes in the 3 light chain CDRs; positions 28 and 30 in CDR-L1 tended to be substituted with Tyrosine and Histidine, respectively, whereas \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 92, 93, and 96 in CDR-L3 were more diverse (Table IV).\n\n\nClones with the highest affinity for both human and murine NRP1 (YW107.4.18, YW107.4.38, YW107.4.52, YW107.4.63, YW107.4.76a and YW107.4.87) were reformatted and expressed as full-length antibodies. All 6 IgGs had improved affinity for hNRP1 and maintained complete blocking of VEGF-A binding. Affinities for human and murine NRP1 ranged from 0.4 to 1.8 nM (Table V). The dissociation rate constant of YW107.4.87 was improved leading to an overall improvement in affinity of about 10-fold for both human and murine NRP1; no binding was observed to human or murine NRP2 (\nFIG. 2A\n). YW107.4.87 also showed improved binding to cell surface NRP1 (\nFIG. 2B\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE IV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDR sequences and binding affinity (phage IC50) for affinity improved YW107.4 clones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deduced amino acids sequences of affinity-matured YW107.4 clones at randomized\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlight chain CDR positions are shown.

For the purpose of this application and in the following descriptions of anti-NRP1 antibody activities, “YW64.3” and “anti-NRP\nA\n” are used interchangeably; and “YW107.4.87” and “anti-NRP\nB\n” are used interchangeably.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nCell Cultures\n\n\nHUVEC, HUAEC, and HMVECs were purchased from Cambrex and cultured in EGM-2 medium (Cambrex). Cells and tissue cultures are maintained at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2\n, 95% humidity incubator.\n\n\nDRG and Hippocampal Collapse Assays\n\n\nCollapse assays on axons from mouse E12.5 DRG were performed as described in He and Tessier-Lavigne (1997) \nCell \n90:739-751. Briefly, DRG explants were plated on laminin coated 8-chamber slides (Nunc) and cultured in N3-F12 medium with 50 ng/ml NGF overnight at 37° C. in a 5% CO\n2\n, 95% humidity incubator. Human Semaphorin-3A (Met-1 to Val-771) was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pRK5 with a C-terminal hexahistidine fusion tag. The protein was transiently expressed in CHO cells and purified by NiNTA affinity chromatography. N-terminal sequencing was used to confirm the protein visible as a 90 kDa band on a Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gel. Purified Sema3A was added at ˜8 ng/ml in the presence or absence of inhibitors, and explants were incubated at 37° C. for 30 min to induce collapse. For visualization, growth cones were fixed in 4% PFA and 15% sucrose, stained with rhodamin-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) at 1:40 in PBS for 30 min, and then washed and mounted with Fluoromount G (Fisher). To perform the hippocampal collapse assay, E17 mouse brains were dissected in chilled PBS and horizontally sectioned into 250 μm thick slices using a tissue chopper (Mcllwain). The dentate gyrus was further subdissected from selected sections of hippocampus using fine tungsten needles. Explants were plated on laminin coated 8-chamber slides (Nunc) and cultured in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Gibco Life Technologies) overnight at 37° C. To induce collapse, explants were incubated with control or anti-NRP1 antibodies (10 μg/ml) in the presence of mock transfected or Sema3F transfected COS cell conditioned media for 30 minutes at 37° C.\n\n\nCell Migration Assay\n\n\nCell migration assays were performed using a modified Boyden chamber assay with the 8 μm pore size Falcon 24-multiwell insert system (BD Biosciences). The plates were pre-coated with 8 μg/ml Laminin (Invitrogen) for 16 hrs at 37° C. in both the upper and lower chambers. HUVECs (80-90% confluent) were harvested with trypsin, counted, centrifuged and resuspended in EBM-2 with 0.1% BSA at a concentration of 5×10\n5 \ncells/ml. 100 μl cells were added into the upper chamber of the transwell system. Inhibitors were added to the upper chamber with the cells immediately before addition of the stimuli to the lower chamber (10 ng/ml of VEGF in most cases), which contained 500 μl EBM-2 with 0.1% BSA. The plates were then placed at 37° C. overnight. To cease the assay, cells on the upper face of the membrane were removed using a sponge swab and cells on the lower face were fixed with methanol and stained with Cytox green (Molecular Probes). The number of migrated cells on the lower face of the membrane was counted using AxiPhot fluorescent microscope and the results were analyzed with the ImageJ program (NIH, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).\n\n\nBead Outgrowth Assay\n\n\nDextran-coated \nCytodex\n 3 microcarrier beads (Amersham Pharmacia) were incubated with subconfluent HUVECs at a concentration of 400 cells per bead in 1 ml of EGM-2 medium, for 4 hrs at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 incubator with gentle shake every 20 min. Beads were then transferred to a 25-cm\n2 \ntissue culture flask (BD Biosciences) and incubated in 5 ml of EGM-2 for 12-16 hrs at 37° C. HUVEC-coated beads were then washed three times with 1 ml EGM-2 and resuspended in 2.5 μg/ml of fibrinogen (Sigma) in PBS at a density of 200 beads/ml. 0.5 ml of fibrinogen/bead solution was transferred into one well of a 24-well tissue culture plate containing 0.625 units thrombin (Sigma) to induce clotting. The fibrinogen/bead solution was incubated for 5 min at room temperature, then for 20 min at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 incubator. After the clotting was complete, 1 ml of EGM-2 was added to each well and the clot was equilibrated for 30 min at 37° C. The medium was removed, and 1 ml of skin fibroblast cells (Detroit 551) at a concentration of 2000/ml in EGM-2 medium were plated on the top of the clot. Different antibodies were then added to each well and the assay was monitored for 8 days with change in medium every 2-3 days. 10× resolution images of the beads were captured by an inverted microscope, and concentric circles spaced at 100, 200, and 300 μm were digitally drawn around the bead in each image. The number of vessels crossing each line was counted and the average was taken at each distance and condition.\n\n\nFACS Analysis\n\n\nConfluent HUVECs were incubated with control or anti-NRP1 antibodies at 10 μg/ml for 5 min, 2 hrs or 20 hrs at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were harvested with enzyme free cell dissociation buffer (Gibco), neutralized with equal volume of FACS buffer (1×PBS, 2% FBS, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium azide) and transferred into Pro-bind U-bottom 96-well assay plates (Falcon) at 500,000 cells per well. Cell pellets were collected by centrifuged at 2 k rpm, and resuspended in 25 μl staining buffer (FACS buffer with 5% normal mouse serum, 2% normal rat serum and 10% 10 μg/ml human IgG) containing appropriate biotinylated antibody at 1:100, followed by a 2 hr incubation at 4° C. Antibodies were biotinylated using the FluoReporter mini-biotin-xx protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes). Cells were then washed twice with FACS buffer, and incubated in 25 μl FACS buffer containing 1:1000 streptavidin-PE (BD Biosciences) for 20 min at 4° C. Finally, cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer, and analyzed with the FacsCalibur system (BD Biosciences).\n\n\nCell Adhesion Assay\n\n\nSubconfluent HUVECs were pre-incubated in 100 μl Medium 199 with control or anti-NRP1 antibodies for 30 min at 37° C., then plated on NUNC maxisorp flat bottom 96-well plates (eBioscience) coated with 1 μg/ml Fibronectin (Roche) at 10,000 cells per well. Plates were centrifuged for 1 min at 140 g to synchronize contract of cells with substrate, and incubated at 37° C. for 30 min. Plates were then washed 3 times with PBS, frozen at −80° C. for two hours. Cell density was determined with the CyQuant kit (Molecular Probes).\n\n\nMouse Neonatal Retinal Vascular Assay\n\n\nNeonatal CD1 mice (same litters) were administered via i.p. with different antibodies at a concentration of 10 mg/kg. The injections were performed on \n \npostnatal day\n \n 1 and 3 for postnatal day 5 (P5) studies, and on \n \n \nday\n \n \n 1, 3 and 5 for P8 studies. Eyes were collected and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 16 hrs at 4° C., followed by PBS washes. The dissected retinas were block with 10% mouse serum in PBSt (PBS, 1% Triton X-100) for 3 hrs, then incubated overnight at 4° C. with biotinylated isolectin B4 (Bandeiraea simplicifolia; Sigma) 25 μg/ml in PBLEC (1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mM CaCl\n2\n, 0.1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.1 mM MnCl\n2\n, in PBS pH 6.8). Retinas were then washed 4 times in PBSt, and incubated with Alexa 488 streptavidin (1:200; Molecular Probes) overnight at 4° C. After staining was completed, retinas were washed 4 times in PBSt, post fixed with 4% PFA in PBS, followed by another 4 washes in PBS. Images of flat mounted retinas were captured by confocal fluorescence microscopy.\n\n\nMouse Skin Vessel Permeability Assay\n\n\n5-7 week C57BL6J female mice were injected with 150 μl 0.5% Evan's blue solution i.v. The areas of the back and flanks of the animals were shaved to remove hair below the neck and above the hip, and the shaved area was divided into 4 injection zones. One hour after the Evan's blue injection, 20 μl of PBS containing BSA (7.5 μg/ml) or hVEGF (7.5 μg/ml) with or without antibody (0.5 mg/ml) were injected i.d. randomly on any one of four zones, one injection for each zone. One hour after the i.d. injection, the animals were sacrificed and the skin containing the 4 zones was dissected out. A digital image of the skin was taken. A 8 mm skin biopsy punch was used to cut out skin samples of same area on the injection sites, and skin samples were incubated in formamide solution at 55° C. for 48 hrs to extract the Evan's blue dye from the tissues. The absorbance of the solution was then measured with a spectrometer at 605 nm.\n\n\nCell Proliferation Assay\n\n\nCell proliferation was analyzed with the Cell Proliferation ELISA kit (Roche). Briefly, 90% confluent HUVECs were harvested and resuspended in assay media (DMEM:F12 50:50, 1.5% FBS), and plated at 3,000 cells per well into black 96-well tissue culture plate (ViewPlate-96, Perkin Elmer) pre-coated with 1% gelatin. Cells were incubated at 37° C. for 16 hrs, changed into fresh assay media and incubated for another 8 hrs. VEGF (20 ng/ml) and different antibodies were added to the culture and the cells were incubated for 20 hrs. BrdU labeling solution was added to a final concentration of 10 mM and the cells were incubated for another 24 hrs at 37° C. BrdU incorporation was determined by chemiluminescence immunoassay.\n\n\nVEGFR2 Phosphorylation Assay\n\n\nTotal VEGFR2 and phospho-VEGFR2 were determined with DuoSet IC ELISA kits (R&D). Briefly, subconfluent HUVECs were rinsed with PBS and lysed in the provided lysis buffer. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14 kg for 5 min at 4° C., and supernatants were transferred to clean tubes. ELISA assays were then carried out as directed.\n\n\nImmunoblotting\n\n\nConfluent HUVECs were starved for 16 hrs in EBM-2 with 0.2% FBS and 0.1% BSA, and then changed into EMB-2 with 0.1% BSA, followed by a 90 min incubation at 37° C. Control and anti-NRP1 antibodies were added at 50 μg/ml, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 37° C. Cells were stimulated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) for 10 min at 37° C., washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, phosphatase inhibitor cocktail I and II (Sigma) and complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). Aliquots of lysate were subjected to electrophoresis in 4-20% Novex Tris-Glycine SDS gels (Invitrogen), followed by electrotransfer to Invitrolon PVDF membrane (Invitrogen). The primary antibodies used in this study were anti-Erk, anti-phospho-Erk, anti-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt, anti-p38, anti-phospho-p38, anti-Src and anti-phospho-Src (Tyr416), all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nA. Selective Actions of Anti-NRP1\nA \nand Anti-NRP1\nB \non Sema3A Function and VEGF Binding, Respectively\n\n\nAnti-NRP1 antibodies were tested for their ability to block binding of VEGF\n165 \nto NRP1. Anti-NRP1\nB \nstrongly blocked VEGF binding to NRP1, whereas anti-NRP1\nA \ndid not (\nFIG. 4\n). These results suggests that the CUB domains (a1-a2) of NRP1 are not necessary for VEGF binding. Gu et al. (2002) \nJ Biol Chem \n277:18069-18076.\n\n\nNext, anti-NRP1 antibodies were tested for their effects on Sema3A function. It has been previously suggested that Sema3A and VEGF\n165 \nmay share overlapping binding domains in the N-terminal region of the b1 domain, and thus may compete for binding to NRP1. Gu et al. (2002) \nJ Biol Chem \n277:18069-18076; Miao et al. (1999) \nJ Cell Biol \n146:233-242. Therefore, it seemed possible that a single anti-NRP1 mAb would block both Sema3A and VEGF binding. Anti-NRP1 mAbs of this invention were tested for their abilities to block Sema3A-induced axon growth cone collapse. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were dissected from mouse E12.5 embryos and cultured to establish sensory neuron growth cones that were responsive to Sema3A/NRP1-dependent collapse. He and Tessier-Lavigne (1997) \nCell \n90:739-751. Adding Sema3A to these cultures caused growth cones to retract their actin rich structures. However, if anti-NRP1\nA \nwas added to the wells at the same time as Sema3A, collapse was completely blocked. In contrast, anti-NRP1\nB \nhad no effect on Sema3A-induced collapse (\nFIG. 5A\n).\n\n\nThese two antibodies thus have functionally distinct actions: anti-NRP1\nA \nblocks Sema3A function but does not interfere with VEGF binding to NRP1; whereas anti-NRP1\nB \nblocks VEGF binding to NRP1 without effect on Sema3A function. Further studies showed that neither antibody blocks Sema3F/NRP2-dependent collapse of E17 hippocampal growth cones (\nFIG. 5B\n), consistent with the observation that neither antibody binds NRP2. The antibodies thus provide selective tools to dissect the role of NRP1 in vascular biology, and means for selectively blocking NRP1 activities.\n\n\nB. Both Anti-NRP1\nA \nand Anti-NRP1\nB \nReduce VEGF\n165\n-Dependent Endothelial Cell Migration and Bead Outgrowth\n\n\nThe anti-NRP1 mAbs of the invention were tested in VEGF-driven endothelial cell (EC) migration. Using a transwell system, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were introduced into the top chamber, while VEGF was added to the bottom chamber to promote EC migration. ECs that had migrated to the bottom chamber were then fixed, stained, and quantified (\nFIG. 6A\n). Anti-VEGF antibodies were used as a positive control to block VEGF-driven EC migration in this and subsequent experiments (a cross-species reactive anti-VEGF antibody, B20.4.1, was used in all experiments unless stated otherwise; Liang et al. (2006) \nJ Biol Chem \n281:951-961.\n\n\nAnti-NRP1 mAbs were added to cells in the top chamber just prior to the addition of VEGF. Interestingly, both anti-NRP1\nA \nand anti-NRP1\nB \nsignificantly reduced endothelial cell migration, with anti-NRP1\nB \nproviding a stronger block of migration (\nFIG. 6A\n). Similar results were obtained using two other types of EC lines, EUAECs and HAECs.\n\n\nTo further dissect the role of NRP1 and anti-NRP1 mAbs in more complex EC functions, an in vitro system of angiogenic sprouting was employed. Nakatsu et al. (2003) \nMicrovasc Res \n66:102-112. In this assay, ECs coated on beads sprout over a seven days period, resulting in multiple well-defined vessel structures protruding from each bead. Adding either anti-NRP1 mAbs to these cultures resulted in a reduction in vessel length, and in the case of anti-NRP1\nB \na decrease in the number of sprouts was also observed. This observation was confirmed by quantification (\nFIG. 6B\n). Anti-VEGF was used as a positive control and completely blocked sprouting in this assay. The results confirmed strong effects for each anti-NRP1 mAb in reducing EC migration and outgrowth of vessels in this in vitro assay.\n\n\nC. NRP1 is Necessary for Vascular Remodeling in the Mouse Retina\n\n\nPhenotypes observed in the Nrp1 knock-out mice are consistent with a defect in vascular remodeling. Gu et al. (2003) \nDev Cell \n5:45-57; Kawasaki et al. (1999) \nDevelopment \n126:895-4902; Takashima et al. (2002) \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n99:3657-3662. Next, the role of NRP1 in vascular remodeling was tested by analyzing the effects of systemic treatment with the anti-NRP1 mAbs on the developing mouse retina, which is an ideal model to investigate the stereotyped events of vascular sprouting, remodeling, and maturation. Dorrell and Friedlander (2006) \nProg Retin Eye Res \n25:277-95. At birth, an astrocytic network is in place to guide ECs sprouting from central retinal artery located near the optic nerve head (ONH). After one day of postnatal life (P1) the retinal vasculature has developed a morphogenic furrow in the nerve fiber layer (NFL), lying superficial to the ganglion cell layer, that begins to extend toward the edge of the retina in a concentric pattern, reaching halfway by P5 (\nFIG. 7A\n). Over the next three days the furrow continues to extend to the edge of the retina, while the vascular plexus closest to the ONH undergoes stereotyped remodeling, consisting of thinning of the vascular plexus into a refined capillary network in the NFL (\nFIG. 7B\n), and sprouting of vessels into deeper layers of the retina (\nFIG. 7C\n).\n\n\nAntibodies were injected into neonatal mice beginning at P1, followed by injections every other day until retinas were collected at P5 and P8. To visualize the vasculature, retinas were stained with isolectin B4 and compared. While the refined capillary network of the IgG control group is well established between P5 and P8, this vascular remodeling is completely inhibited by both anti-NRP1 mAbs. This difference was quantified by comparing the vascular density from representative images taken of the NFL vascular network in regions adjacent to the ONH (\nFIG. 7D\n). Because treatment with either anti-NRP1 mAb results in a strong inhibition of vascular remodeling, vascular density is significantly higher in both anti-NRP1\nA \nand anti-NRP1\nB \ntreated retinas as compared to controls. Interestingly, the developmental furrow continues to extend in both anti-NRP1 mAb treated retinas, with only a slight inhibition of extension in the anti-NRP1\nB \ntreated animals (\nFIG. 7E\n). This suggests that development of the retina is not generally inhibited, but that there is instead a specific block in vascular remodeling when treating with either anti-NRP1 mAb.\n\n\nIn contrast to the anti-NRP1 mAbs, anti-VEGF treatment resulted in a reduction of retinal vascular density as compared to control (\nFIG. 7D\n). At a qualitative level, vessels in anti-VEGF treated retinas have a reduced complexity at P8, a trend that is present but less obvious at P5. These data suggest that anti-VEGF treatment results in either block of initial sprouting and/or vascular regression. Interestingly, systemic delivery of anti-VEGF does not significantly reduce the extension of the vascular furrow (\nFIG. 7E\n). This is likely a consequence of poor antibody diffusion to the extending tip cells due to the lack of vessel lumens in this outer region. Gerhardt et al. (2003) \nJ Cell Biol \n161:1163-1177.\n\n\nEvaluating P8 retinas also allowed further investigation of the effects of antibody treatment on angiogenic sprouting. Between P5 and P8, vessels begin to sprout from the NFL vascular network into deeper vascular layers resulting in the formation of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) vascular network, which is superficial to the outer nuclear layer and is the deepest vascular bed in the retina (\nFIG. 7C\n). Later in development, sprouting from collaterals that gave rise to the OPL results in an intermediate vascular bead, termed the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Images taken from the OPL at P8 show a complete inhibition of sprouting by both anti-NRP1 mAbs, and by anti-VEGF treatments.\n\n\nThe different phenotypes observed in retinas taken from animals systemically treated with either anti-NRP1\nA \nor anti-NRP1\nB\n, as compared to anti-VEGF, suggest that NRP1 may regulate EC function by mechanisms other than enhancing VEGFR2 signaling.\n\n\nD. Blocking NRP1 Function has Little Effect on VEGFR2 Signaling\n\n\nHaving observed that NRP1 is required for endothelial cell migration in response to VEGF, we investigated the requirement of NRP1 in EC proliferation and vascular permeability—two defining cellular activities induced by VEGF. Remarkably, treatment with either anti-NRP1\nA \nor anti-NRP1\nB \nhad no effect on VEGF-induced permeability, whereas anti-VEGF provided a strong block (\nFIG. 8A\n). A similar trend was observed when testing for VEGF-induced EC proliferation, with anti-NRP1\nA \nshowing no block of proliferation, and anti-NRP1\nB \nonly a slight dose-responsive reduction (\nFIG. 8B\n). These results support previously published data showing that siRNA knockdown of NRP1 in ECs does not effect proliferation induced by VEGF (Murga et al. (2005) \nBlood \n105:1992-1999), and suggests that NRP1's primary role in VEGF-driven EC behaviors is to mediate cell migration.\n\n\nThe effect of anti-NRP1 antibodies on VEGFR2 signaling was studied. VEGF binds to the second and third extracellular IgG domains of VEGFR2, and activates the receptor by triggering auto-phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain. In contrast to anti-VEGF, which completely blocked VEGFR2 phosphorylation induced by VEGF in HUVECs, anti-NRP1\nA \ndid not significantly change VEGFR2 phosphorylation levels, whereas anti-NRP1\nB \nresulted in only a modest reduction (\nFIG. 8C\n).\n\n\nRather than regulating VEGFR2 phosphorylation level directly, NRP1 may act to modulate specific VEGFR2 pathways. To address this possibility, the effect of anti-NRP1 treatment on downstream signaling events mediated by VEGFR2 was examined. VEGFR2 has been shown to induce EC proliferation through activation of the mitogen activated protein kinases Erk1/2 (Rousseau et al. (1997) \nOncogene \n15:2169-2177; Takahashi et al. \nShibuya \n(1999) \nOncogene \n18:2221-2230), and to regulate EC survival and vascular permeability through the P13-Kinase/Akt pathway. Chen et al. (2005) \nNat Med \n11:1188-1196; Gerber et al. (1998) \nJ Biol Chem \n273:13313-13316; Six et al. (2002) \nFEBS Lett \n532:67-69. Consistent with the observation that anti-NRP1 mAb treatments did not significantly change VEGF-induced EC proliferation or vascular permeability, anti-NRP1\nA \nand anti-NRP1\nB \nincubation did not affect VEGF-induced phosphorylation of Erk1/2 or Akt. On the other hand, inhibiting NRP1 function with anti-NRP1 antibodies strongly reduced EC migration. It is possible that NRP1 specifically regulates VEGFR2 pathways required for cell motility, such as the p38 MAP kinase pathway, which has been shown to be required for VEGF-driven actin reorganization and cell migration in ECs. Rousseau et al. (1997) \nOncogene \n15:2169-2177. Anti-NRP1\nA \nand anti-NRP1\nB \ntreatments both led to a slight reduction in p38 phosphorylation level in HUVECs (\nFIG. 8D\n), lending support to this hypothesis. However, the mild decrease in p38 phosphorylation alone is unlikely to account for the strong reduction we observed in the migration and sprouting assays as described in previous sections (\nFIG. 6\n), or explain the qualitatively different phenotypes observed between the anti-NRP1 mAbs and anti-VEGF mAb treatments in the retinal vascular remodeling experiments (\nFIG. 7\n).\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\nTumor Inhibitory Activities of Anti-NRP1 Antibodies\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nThe human cell lines, H1299 and SK-MES-1 non-small-cell lung carcinomas were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, Md.). For SK-MES-1, each HRLN female nude mouse received a 1 mm\n3 \ntumor fragment s.c. implant in the flank. For H1299, 1×10\n7 \ntumor cells were injected s.c. in the flank of HRLN female nude mice. Tumor growth was monitored twice weekly by caliper measurements. When tumors reach an average size of 80-120 mm\n3\n, mice were sorted to give nearly identical group mean tumor sizes, and treatment was started. This was considered \nday\n 1 of each study. All treatments were body-weight adjusted at 0.2 ml/20 g. Tumor volume (mm\n3\n)=width\n2\n×length/2. Percent tumor growth inhibition (% TGI)=(median tumor volume of the control arm−median tumor volume of the treatment arm/median tumor volume of the control arm)×100. % TGI is only measured as long as all animals remain on they study (for SK-MES-1=\nday\n 22; for H1299=day 15). Time to endpoint (TTE)=log\n10 \n(endpoint volume, mm\n3\n)−b/m; were b is the intercept and m is the slope of the line obtained by linear regression of the log-transformed tumor growth data. Percent tumor growth delay (% TGD)=(median TTE for a treatment arm−median TTE for the control arm/median TTE for the control arm)×100.\n\n\nMice were anesthetized with Avertin (1.3% tribromoethanol and 0.8% amyl alcohol; Sigma-Aldrich). FITC-labeled Lycopersicon esculentum lectin (150 μg in 150 μl of 0.9% NaCl; Vector Laboratories) was injected i.v. 3 minutes before systemic perfusion. The vasculature was perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 2 to 3 min. Tumors were removed and post-fixed by immersion in the same fixative for 16 hrs, followed by an incubation in 30% sucrose overnight for cryoprotection, then embedded in OCT and frozen. Sections (30 μm) were cut and mounted onto glass slides, rehydrated and blocked in PBSt (PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100) with 5% normal goat serum for 2 hrs at room temperature. The sections were incubated overnight with anti-NRP1\nB \n(1:500) or rat anti-mouse PDGFRβ (1:1000; clone APB5, eBioscience) at 4° C. Sections were then washed 4 times in PBSt, and incubated with secondary antibodies, Alexa 488 goat anti-human IgG and Alexa 568 goat anti-rat IgG (1:200; Molecular Probes), for 4 hrs at room temperature. After staining was completed, sections were washed 4 times in PBSt, post fixed with 4% PFA in PBS, followed by another 4 washes in PBS. The final wash solution was removed, and 1-2 drops of Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech) were added. Glass coverslips were placed over samples, and images were captured with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nBlocking the VEGF pathway has been proven to reduce neovascularization in mouse tumor models and in human cancers. Ferrara and Kerbel (2005) \nNature \n438:967-974. However, it is believed that some tumors are less dependent on VEGF for vessel formation, or may become insensitive to anti-VEGF therapies. Jain et al. (2006) \nNat Clin Pract Oncol \n3:24-40; Kerbel et al. (2001) \nCancer Metastasis Rev \n20:79-86. To determine if NRP1 blockade could enhance the tumor growth inhibition provided by blocking VEGF, we selected several xenograft models known to exhibit varying sensitivity to anti-VEGF therapy. Since mouse stromal VEGF, in addition to tumor derived VEGF, has been shown to impact tumor growth, we used anti-VEGF mAbs that recognize both murine and human VEGF. Liang et al. (2006) \nJ Biol Chem \n281:951-961.\n\n\nThese experiments were designed to test the effect of blocking NRP1 alone and in combination with anti-VEGF. Also included were single agent anti-VEGF and isotype control antibody. SK-MES-1 is a NSCLC xenograft model that expresses NRP1 primarily in vascular and stromal tissue, with an intermediate level of expression in tumor cells. In this model, anti-VEGF provided a 52% tumor growth inhibition (TGI), single agent anti-NRP1\nB \ncaused a 37% TGI, and anti-NRP1\nA \nhad no significant effect on TGI (\nFIG. 9A\n).\n\n\nStrikingly, the additive effect was observed when either anti-NRP1 antibody was used in combination with anti-VEGF. As depicted in \nFIG. 10A\n, anti-NRP1\nA \nused in combination with anti-VEGF increased the TGI from about 52% to about 70%; and anti-NRP1\nB \nused in combination with anti-VEGF increased the TGI to about 77% (\nFIG. 9A\n). Similar results were obtained in the H1299 NSCLC xenograft model, which also expresses NRP1 in vascular and stromal tissue at high levels, but in tumor cells to a lesser extent. Single agent anti-NRP1\nB \nshowed 39% TGI, anti-VEGF showed 28% TGI, and the combination showed 51% TGI (\nFIG. 9C\n).\n\n\nAnimals in the SK-MES-1 model were dosed to \nday\n 35 and followed to \nday\n 60 to examine the delay in tumor growth (animals were removed from the study when tumor sizes exceeded 1500 mm\n3\n; no animals were removed as a result of toxicity). The Kaplan-Meier plot shows a significant effect of both anti-NRP1 mAb combination arms in delaying tumor growth as compared to single agent arms (\nFIG. 9B\n). Measurements of tumor growth delay (TGD) show no single agent delay for anti-NRP1\nA\n; 24% TGD for anti-NRP1\nB\n; 60% TGD for anti-VEGF; 93% TGD for anti-NRP1\nA\n+anti-VEGF combination arm; and 96% for anti-NRP1\nB\n+anti-VEGF combination arm.\n\n\nSimilar results to those seen in the NSCLC models were also observed in a murine model of breast cancer, termed founder 5 (Fo5), in which tumors generated by MMTV-Her2 transgenic expression were dissected and implanted in nude mice. Finkle et al. (2004) \nClin Cancer Res \n10:2499-2511. In this model, NRP1 is primarily expressed on vessels and adjacent stroma, and anti-VEGF is again only partially effective at reducing tumor growth (\nFIG. 9C\n). Growth inhibition was similar to that seen in the NSCLC models, however to focus on the histological changes in the context of anti-NRP1 and anti-VEGF treatment, animals were harvested on the same day early in the experiment (dashed line; \nFIG. 9C\n).\n\n\nUsing the Fo5 model for vascular histology studies, we observed that control tumors showed very large unorganized vessels that generally lack pericyte coverage as determined by PDGFR-β immunohistochemistry. Treatment with anti-VEGF alone resulted in a decrease in vessel diameter and a general reduction in vascular density. In addition, most, if not all vessels that remained in anti-VEGF treated tumors showed close association of pericytes. Similar results were observed with other pericyte markers.\n\n\nVessels from tumors treated with either anti-NRP1 mAb alone appear similar in morphology to anti-NRP1 treated vessels in neonatal mouse retinas, with vessels appearing flat and unorganized, maintaining a plexus-like appearance. On the other hand, similar to control treated tumor vessels, tumors treated with either anti-NRP1 mAb also lack significant pericyte coverage. Most interestingly, tumors that were treated with anti-VEGF and either anti-NRP1\nA \nor anti-NRP1\nB\n, showed a combined phenotype, with vessel reduction similar to anti-VEGF treated tumors, but with remaining vessels appearing less refined and lacking close pericyte association.\n\n\nThese morphological observations are correlated with the quantified changes in vascular desensity. As shown in \nFIG. 10\n, treatment with both anti-NRP1 antibodies and anti-VEGF decreased vascular density (\n10\nA). On the other hand, only anti-VEGF seems to increase perictye staining in tumor samples tested, as compared to control. Overall, pericyte/vascular ratio measuring relative pericyte coverage shows that anti-VEGF treated tumors had the highest ratio, which is decreased by anti-NRP1\nA \nand anti-NRP1\nB \ntreatment.\n\n\nThe findings that anti-NRP1 (anti-NRP1\nA \nand anti-NRP1\nB\n) and anti-VEGF may be acting by blocking different EC functions and/or signaling pathways raised the possibility that combining these antibodies in tumor models could have an additive or synergistic effect in reducing tumor growth. Indeed, a profound additive effect was observed when combining anti-NRP1 with anti-VEGF (\nFIG. 9\n). Especially in the case of anti-NRP1\nA\n, the results suggest a synergistic, rather than additive effect, since in multiple tumor models the mean tumor volume following single agent anti-NRP1\nA \ntreatment was not different from control, but the antibody significantly enhanced tumor response when combined with anti-VEGF, compared to anti-VEGF treatment alone.\n\n\nIn the case of anti-NRP1\nB\n, single agent treatment resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth. Interestingly, these effects are only slightly less potent than anti-VEGF alone. However, the reduction in tumor growth from the combination arms for anti-NRP1\nB \nwas similar to the anti-NRP1\nA \ncombination arms. The single agent effect of anti-NRP1\nB \nmay be due to its relatively stronger inhibitory activity in reducing sprouting and in vivo angiogenesis, compared to anti-NRP1\nA\n. On the other hand, both antibodies were equally potent in blocking vascular remodeling in the mouse retinal development assay and inhibiting pericyte association with vessels in the Fo5 tumor model.\n\n\nIt has been proposed that vascular remodeling in the retina takes place in the absence of close pericyte associations, suggesting that pericytes serve to stabilize immature blood vessels ending the plasticity period of vessel remodeling. Benjamin et al. (1998) \nDevelopment \n125:1591-1598. Findings of this invention suggest that NRP1 is required for this intricate process of vessel remodeling, consisting of the morphogenesis of the vascular plexus into fine capillaries, followed by further maturation.\n\n\nThe idea of pericytes stabilizing tumor vessels, thus giving rise to anti-VEGF therapy resistance as a consequence of vessels losing their VEGF-dependence, has been proposed and tested experimentally. Bergers et al. (2003) \nJ Clin Invest \n111:1287-1295; Erber et al. (2004) \nFaseb J \n18:338-340. In these studies, it was observed that blocking both the function of VEGF (EC ligand) and PDGF (pericyte ligand) results in further disruption of tumor vasculature. Subsequently, it has been shown in imaging studies that blocking VEGF function alone in tumors results in a significant amount of vascular regression, but the remaining vessels become “normalized” with close pericyte associations, possibly a consequence of immature vessels undergoing vascular remodeling and maturation. Inai et al. (2004) \nAm J Pathot \n165:35-52.\n\n\nBased on the observations obtained in the developing retina, it can be postulated that blocking NRP1 function in tumors would also reduce vascular remodeling of tumor vessels, subsequently inhibiting vessel maturation, therefore keeping vessels in a state of VEGF-dependence. This alone may not have a significant effect on reducing tumor growth, as most tumor vessels are already inherently disorganized. Baluk et al. (2005) \nCurr Opin Genet Dev \n15:102-111. This prediction is consistent with the observation that, although anti-NRP1\nA \nstrongly inhibits vascular remodeling, we do not see a single agent effect with this antibody in reducing tumor growth. However, it was speculated that blocking vascular remodeling, and the subsequent maturation, in combination with anti-VEGF therapy may render the remaining tumor vessels more susceptible to regression. The experiments of the present invention showed that vessels remaining in tumors treated with either anti-NRP1 mAb in combination with anti-VEGF indeed lack pericyte association. These results suggest that the additive effect we observe in blocking both NRP1 and VEGF function may arise as a consequence of rendering remaining vessels in anti-VEGF treated tumors more vulnerable to regression.\n\n\nBased on the results obtained in developing retina and xenograft tumor models, it is postulated that blocking NRP1 function in newly formed vessels inhibits vessels from undergoing remodeling and subsequent maturation, thus rendering these vessels more dependent on VEGF for survival (see the model in \nFIG. 11A\n). Consistent with this model, we observed a significant decrease in vascular density of the developing retina in neonate mice treated with both anti-NRP1\nB \nand anti-VEGF at half the dose of single agent alone (single dose=10 mg/kg, combination dose=5 mg/kg of each antibody). See \nFIG. 11B\n, as compared to \nFIG. 7D\n.\n\n\nMoreover, it is possible that NRP1 may also be required not only for endothelial but also pericyte function. It has recently been reported that bFGF induces upregulation of NRP1 on smooth muscle cells, resulting in the ability of VEGF to induce smooth muscle cell migration. Liu et al. (2005) \nCytokine \n32:206-212. In the present experiment, expression of NRP1 was seen on human smooth muscle cells, as well as on pericytes in various murine and human tumors (for example, expression of NRP1 extends to areas adjacent to lectin positive stain in the Fo5 model).\n\n\nIn conclusion, the experiments described herein demonstrate that blocking NRP1 and VEGF function in tumor models results in an additive effect in reducing tumor growth. Also presented are evidences that NRP1 may also be acting through mechanisms other than VEGFR2 signaling."
