The method according to \nclaim 11\n, wherein the disorder or disease is selected from the group consisting of lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostate hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to novel tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and to their use in therapy, in particular to their use for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe estrogen receptor (ER) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. Estrogens play an important role in the regulation of a number of physiological processes, both in females and males. In humans, two different ER subtypes are known: ERα and ERβ, each with a distinct tissue distribution and with different biological roles. ERα has high presence in endometrium, breast cancer cells, ovarian stroma cells and in the hypothalamus. The expression of the ERβ protein has been documented in kidney, brain, bone, heart, lungs, intestinal mucosa, prostate, bladder, ovary, testis and endothelial cells. Subtype-selective ligands may therefore have attractive therapeutic applications in these tissues and organs (for a review see: J. W. Ullrich and C. P. Miller, \nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents, \n16 (2006) 559-572).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBenign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, is a common disorder in elderly men. The condition is characterized by a progressive enlargement of prostatic tissue, resulting in obstruction of the proximal urethra and causing urinary flow disturbances. BPH is associated with both obstructive and irritative voiding symptoms, with bladder outlet obstruction as the most prominent symptom. Obstructive symptoms include straining, hesitancy, decreased force and caliber of the urine stream, an intermittent stream, a sense of incomplete emptying, and terminal dribbling. Irritative symptoms include urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia. The occurrence of an enlargement of the prostate is thought to be related to many factors, but the presence of androgens in the prostate is a prerequisite. In addition, estrogens also play an important role in proliferation in the prostate. J. Cheng et al. in \nFEBS Lett. \n566 (2004) 169-172, suggested that ERβ-selective agonists might be used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation. Aging βERKO (ERβ knock out) mice develop prostate hyperplasia (O. Imamov et al., \nPNAS \n101 (2004) 9375-9380) and upon estradiol treatment these βERKO mice develop prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions (precursor of prostate cancer). The αERKO (ERα knock out) mice, on the other hand, do not develop prostate hyperplasia and PIN lesions upon estradiol treatment (G. P. Risbridger et al., \nJ. Molecular Endocrinology \n39 (2007) 183-188). This finding confirms the protective role of ERβ in the prostate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe aromatase knock-out (ARKO) mice develop significant prostate hyperplasia. Recently, it was shown that treatment of ARKO mice with an ERβ-selective agonist reduced the hyperplastic lesions in the prostate (see S. J. Ellem and G. P. Risbridger, \nNature Rev. Cancer, \n7 (2007) 621-627). The authors also suggested a possible protective role for ERβ-selective agonists in prostate cancer. Indeed treatment of ARKO mice with estradiol increased PIN lesions, whereas treatment with an ERβ-selective agonist did not result in PIN lesions. The precursor lesion for prostate cancer is high grade PIN, a form of hyperplasia in the peripheral zone of the prostate. Therefore, ERβ-selective agonists might also be used as a treatment for patients with high grade PIN to prevent or delay the onset of prostate cancer. Moreover, another study demonstrated that the presence of ERβ prevented prostate cancer in a preclinical prostate cancer model (I. M. Coleman et al., \nNeoplasia \n8 (2006) 862-878). It has also been described that ERβ is expressed in prostate cancer metastasis and especially bone, suggesting a protective role of ERβ in prostate cancer bone metastasis (I. Leav et al., \nAm. J. Pathol. \n159 (2001) 79-92).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProstate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men. Prostate carcinoma originates in the peripheral zone of the prostate. The process of carcinogenesis occurs in epithelial tissue and is initiated following genetic damage to the epithelial cells. Sex steroids play a key role in prostate cancer progression, especially the 17β-estradiol/testosterone (E2/T) ratio.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe process of prostate carcinogenesis occurs with long latency periods. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), a precursor of prostate cancer, has been observed in young men. Progression of PIN to high grade PIN may take another 10 years. After this, it may take several years for metastatic cancer to develop. High grade PIN predominantly occurs in the peripheral zone of the prostate, where 70% of prostate cancers arise. The long latent period provides important opportunity to prevent the development of invasive metastasis cancer (bone cancer is a common prostate cancer metastasis). However, due to the long latency period some men may never be treated for prostate cancer and eventually die of other causes. Drug therapy aims to inhibit the growth of androgen-dependent tumors and to prevent their progression into hormone-independent metastasis stages. Androgen ablation therapy has been shown to produce the most beneficial effect in patients with hormone-responsive prostate tumors (grade III and metastatic tumors). However, hormone therapy frequently results in hormone refractory prostate tumors after approximately 3-5 years of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, although there are a number of treatments available for BPH and prostate cancer, there remains a need for alternative compounds and treatments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of ERβ-selective ligands for other therapeutic indications has also been implicated. The specific activity of ERβ in the regulation of hot flushes has been described (E. E. Opas et al., \nMaturitas, \n53 (2006) 210-216; D. Grady et al., \nMenopause, \n16 (2009) 458-465).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specific antianxiety behavioral effect of ERβ has been described (A. A. Walf and C. A. Frye, \nNeuropsychopharmacology, \n30 (2005) 1598-1609). Moreover, a potential beneficial effect of ERβ on depressive behavior was observed (A. A. Walf et al., \nPharmacol. Biochem. Behav., \n78 (2004) 523-529).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntroduction of ERβ in the breast cancer cell line T47D, was shown to inhibit tumor growth by inhibiting angiogenesis (J. Hartman et al., \nCancer Res., \n66 (2006) 11207-11213).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInfection of ER-negative medullary thyroid carcinoma TT cells with ERβ suppressed the growth of these cells. Furthermore, apoptosis was detected in the ERβ-infected cells (M. A. Cho et al., \nJournal of Endocrinology, \n195 (2007) 255-263).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA role for ERβ in folliculogenesis has also been described, since ERβ knock out mice displayed fewer corpora lutea than their wild type counterparts (H. A. Harris, \nMol. Endocrinol., \n21 (2007) 1-13).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn ovarian cancer, a link was made between loss of ERβ expression and malignant transformation. ERβ expression was significantly higher in stage I disease compared with stage II-IV disease. A higher ERβ expression was found to be significantly associated with a longer disease-free survival as well as overall survival (K. K. L. Chan et al., \nObstet. Gynecol., \n111 (2008) 144-151). Moreover, introduction of ERβ in an ovarian cancer cell line reduced proliferation and invasion and increased cellular apoptosis (G. Lazennec, \nCancer Lett., \n231 (2006), 151-157).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been shown that an ERβ-selective ligand treated chronic intestinal inflammation in HLA-B27 mice and was effective at reducing joint swelling in an adjuvant-induced rheumatoid arthritis model (H. A. Harris et al., \nEndocrinology, \n144 (2003) 4241-4249) and therefore has therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease and/or arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis anti-inflammatory effect of ERβ-selective ligands has also been demonstrated in another model for chronic inflammation. An ERβ-selective compound reduced endometrial lesions in an experimentally induced endometriosis model (H. A. Harris et al., \nHum. Reprod., \n20 (2005) 936-941).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protective role of ERβ in colon cancer has been described by O. Wada-Hiraike et al. in \nBiochem. Soc. Trans., \n34 (2006) 1114-1116).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelective estrogen receptor β (ERβ) compounds are known in the prior art. WO 01/64665 discloses chroman derivatives, which are shown to be selective agonists for ERβ over ERα. These compounds are described to be useful in estrogen receptor-related medical treatments, such as those for contraception or for treatment or prevention of benign prostate hypertrophy, cardiovascular disorders, menopausal complaints, osteoporosis, estrogen dependent tumour control or central nervous system disorders such as depression or Alzheimer's disease. They are particularly suitable for the treatment of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disorders, prostate disorders and central nervous system disorders such as depression or Alzheimer's disease, but no biological activity data on any of these therapeutic indications are provided.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds with a 1-benzyl-3-phenyl-tetralone (or tetrahydronaphthalene) skeleton, analogous to the chroman derivatives disclosed in WO 01/64665, have been mentioned in EP 00200713.6, but no specific examples of such compounds have actually been disclosed therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO 03/044006 discloses substituted benzopyrans as selective estrogen receptor β agonists, which are described to be useful in the treatment of prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, urinary incontinence, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, gastrointestinal (GI) tract disorders, and osteoporosis. The selectivity of said benzopyrans for ERβ over ERα is low. No in vivo data are shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO 2006/088716 discloses substituted tetralins as selective estrogen receptor β agonists, which are described to be useful in the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy, obesity, dementia, hypertension, incontinence, colon cancer, prostate cancer, infertility, depression, leukemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and arthritis. No data for the selectivity of said tetralins for ERβ over ERα and no in vivo data are shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a series of tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives, more in particular 6-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives, which are selective ERβ agonists and which can be used inter alia for the prevention or treatment of LUTS, BPH, and prostate cancer, of the following Formula 1\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n \n \n \nR1 is (C1-C4)alkyl, (C2-C4)alkenyl or (C2-C4)alkynyl, independently optionally substituted with one or more halogen, R1 having a cis-orientation in relation to both the exocyclic phenyl group at the 6-position and the benzyl group at the 8-position of the skeleton;\n \nR2-R13 are independently H, halogen, CN, OH, (C1-C4)alkyl, optionally substituted with one or more halogen or (C1-C2)alkoxy;\n\n\nor a prodrug or an isotopically-labelled derivative thereof.\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention contain three centers of chirality and because of the cis-orientation of the substituents at C6, C7 and C8 of the tetrahydro-naphthalen-2-ol skeleton, can exist as a racemic mixture of enantiomers, containing substantially equal amounts of the two enantiomers, as mixtures of enantiomers in any proportions or as the pure enantiomers. The present invention includes the aforementioned mixtures and racemic mixtures within its scope and each of the individual (+) and (−) enantiomers substantially free of the other enantiomer, i.e. an enantiomer associated with less than 5%, preferably less than 2%, in particular less than 1% of the other enantiomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention show a surprisingly high metabolic stability in human hepatocytes, in particular when compared to corresponding chroman compounds, some of which compounds are disclosed in WO 01/64665. Drugs are most often eliminated from the body by biotransformation and/or excretion into bile or urine. The liver is the major organ for biotransformation of xenobiotics. Biotransformation is achieved via two major enzymatic routes in the liver: structural modification (Phase I metabolism) or conjugation (Phase II metabolism). A reduced rate of metabolism (i.e. higher metabolic stability) will result in higher and more prolonged plasma levels of a drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are subtype-selective estrogen receptor β (ERβ) agonists with high selectivity over the estrogen receptor α (ERα). The presence of ERα agonistic activity in a drug will contribute to unwanted ERα-mediated side effects, like feminization. When drugs have reduced ERβ agonistic selectivity over ERα, the ERα-mediated side effects will become apparent at lower doses. Thus, drugs are preferred with highest ERβ agonistic selectivity over ERα.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skeleton of the compounds in this invention contains three chiral centres, with an all-cis configuration. Such compounds can exist as two different enantiomers, which are 3-dimensional mirror images of each other. In one enantiomer the three chiral centres are all directed upwards relative to the plain of the scaffold and in the other enantiomer they are all directed downwards. The single enantiomer with highest activity on a biological target is defined as the eutomer on that target; the enantiomer with the lowest activity is defined as the distomer on that target. The ratio of the activities of the eutomer and the distomer is called the eudismic ratio. We observed that for the compounds of the present invention, the eutomers on ERβ have relatively low ERα agonistic activity, whereas the distomers on ERβ have relatively high ERα agonistic activity. In other words, for the compounds in accordance with the present invention we found, unexpectedly, that the eudismic ratio on ERβ is (much) higher than on ERα. Thus, unexpectedly, the eutomers have higher ERβ agonistic selectivity over ERα than the distomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in a further embodiment of the present invention a series of tetrahydro-naphthalen-2-ol derivatives of the following Formula 2 is provided, with the indicated absolute stereochemistry\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n \n \n \nR1 is (C1-C4)alkyl, (C2-C4)alkenyl or (C2-C4)alkynyl, independently optionally substituted with one or more halogen, R1 having a cis-orientation in relation to both the exocyclic phenyl group at the 6-position and the benzyl group at the 8-position of the skeleton;\n \nR2-R13 are independently H, halogen, CN, OH, (C1-C4)alkyl, optionally substituted with one or more halogen or (C1-C2)alkoxy;\n\n\nor a prodrug or an isotopically-labelled derivative thereof.\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl group may be linear or branched. Suitable examples include methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tertiary butyl, ethenyl, propen-2-yl, ethynyl and propynyl. Halogen means fluorine, chorine, bromine and iodine, in particular fluorine and chlorine. A particularly suitable (C1-C4)alkyl group substituted with one or more halogen is a trifluoromethyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, R1 is (C1-C4)alkyl, optionally substituted with one or more halogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA prodrug is defined as being a compound which is converted in the body of a recipient to a compound as defined by Formula 1. Notably, the hydroxyl groups at the 6-phenyl substituent or at the 2-position of the skeleton of Formula 1 can for example be substituted by an alkyl, alkenyl, acyl, aroyl, alkoxycarbonyl, alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, alkylsulfamate, arylsulfamate, phosphate group or glycosyl group, whereby the carbon chain length is not considered to be sharply delimited, while aroyl and aryl generally will comprise a phenyl, pyridinyl or pyrimidinyl, which groups can have substitutions customary in the art, such as alkyl, hydroxy, halogen, nitro, cyano, and (mono-, or dialkyl)amino groups. The carbon chain length is selected depending on the desired properties of the prodrugs, whereby the longer chained prodrugs with for example lauryl or caproyl chains generally are more suitable for sustained release and depot preparations. It is known that such substituents spontaneously hydrolyze or are enzymatically hydrolyzed to the free hydroxyl substituents on the skeleton of the compound. Such prodrugs will have biological activity comparable to the compounds to which they are converted in the body of the recipients. The active compound to which a prodrug is converted is called the parent compound. The onset of action and duration of action as well as the distribution in the body of a prodrug may differ from such properties of the parent compound. Also the resulting plasma concentration of the parent compound after administration of the prodrug may differ from the resulting plasma concentration after direct administration of the parent compound. For other types of prodrugs it should be realized that the hydroxyl groups in compounds according to Formula 1 can be placed in position by the metabolic system of the recipient. The hydroxyl groups give an important contribution to the affinity for the estrogen receptor. Thus, compounds as defined by Formula 1, but lacking one or both hydroxyl groups are also made available as compounds according to this invention, and which compounds are referred to as prodrugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the hydroxyl group at the 6-phenyl substituent and/or at the 2-position of the skeleton of Formula 1 is substituted with a (C1-C8)alkyl, (C1-C18)acyl, glucosyl or glucuronyl group, in a further embodiment with a (C1-C4)alkyl, (C1-C8)acyl or glucuronyl group. Representative examples of such prodrugs are described in Tables 2 and 4 hereinbelow.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrugs of tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives of Formula 1 may be prepared to increase their aqueous solubility in order to facilitate pharmaceutical formulation and/or to improve bioavailability following various routes of administration (e.g. intestinal absorption after oral administration). Such solubilizing prodrugs are well known to those of skill in the art. Representative examples of this approach can be found in V. J. Stella and W. N.-A. Kwame, \nAdvanced Drug Delivery Reviews, \n59 (2007) 677-694.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also embraces isotopically-labelled derivatives of any of the compounds according to Formula 1, which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the present invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine, chlorine and iodine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n11\nC, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, \n36\nCl and \n123\nI, respectively. Certain isotopically-labelled derivatives of the compounds of Formula 1 (e.g. those labelled with \n3\nH and \n14\nC) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e. \n3\nH) and carbon-14 (i.e. \n14\nC) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula 1 can be useful for medical imaging purposes. E.g., those labelled with positron-emitting isotopes like \n11\nC or \n18\nF can be useful for application in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and those labelled with gamma ray emitting isotopes like \n123\nI can be useful for application in Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e. \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g. increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.

The general synthetic procedures used to prepare the compounds described in the examples below are depicted in the following reaction schemes. Variations to these schemes can easily be made by one skilled in the art. In the following schemes, PG refers to any suitable protecting group and the R groups are as defined in Formula 1 or 2 above, and where needed the R group is capped with a suitable protecting group during the synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n8-Benzyl tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ols can be prepared as racemic mixtures according to Scheme 2, starting from appropriately substituted 4,4′-dimethoxybenzylphenyl ketones (which are also known as desoxyanisoin derivatives). Desoxyanisoin derivatives can be prepared in various manners as depicted in Scheme 1. In one method, 1,3-dithiane derivative 12 is deprotonated, followed by addition of benzyl bromide derivative 14, resulting in formation of compound 13. Upon reaction with periodic acid, the 1,3-dithiane moiety is converted to a carbonyl group resulting in formation of desoxyanisoin derivative 1. In an alternative approach, (un)substituted methoxybenzene 15 is reacted with acid chloride derivative 16 in a Friedel-Crafts reaction to give desoxyanisoin derivative 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDesoxyanisoin derivative 1 can be reacted with an alkyl bromoacetate in a Reformatsky reaction to give, after dehydration, compound 2 (see Scheme 2). Subsequently, the position alpha to the carbonyl can be alkylated by treatment with base and an alkylating agent (X=halogen, alkylsulfonate, arylsulfonate, or other leaving group). After reduction of the stilbene-type double bond compound 3 is obtained.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, compound 3 can be prepared directly from compound 1 by reaction with an α-bromo,α-alky ester 17 that already contains substituent R1, followed by elimination of water and reduction of the stilbene-type double bond, as depicted in Scheme 3.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnder acidic conditions compound 3 can be cyclized to tetralone 4 (see Scheme 2). Tetralone 4 can be converted to enol triflate 5 by reaction with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride. Enol triflate 5 can be converted to compound 7 by a palladium- or nickel-catalyzed coupling reaction with organometallic reagent 6 (M=Zn, Mg; X=halogen). Reduction of the non-aromatic double bond in 7 can be achieved by Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation to give compound 8. The protecting groups in compound 8 can be removed by various methods known in the art of organic chemistry, depending of the nature of the applied protecting groups. For example, when PG=methyl, removal of the protecting groups can be achieved by reaction with boron tribromide to afford the bis-phenolic compound 9, as a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds 9 in which R1 is (C2-C4)alkenyl or (C2-C4)alkynyl can be prepared from corresponding compounds 9 in which R1 is 2-fluoroethyl, which can be synthesized according to Scheme 2. The fluoroethyl group can subsequently be converted to alkenyl or alkynyl groups by various methods known in the art of organic chemistry, for example by conversion of 2-fluoroethyl to 2-bromoethyl followed by elimination of HBr to give compound 9 in which R1 is ethenyl. Alternatively, the 2-bromoethyl substituent can undergo a substitution reaction with an organometallic reagent to introduce an alkenyl or alkynyl group. Alternatively, alkenyl groups may be converted to alkynyl groups by an oxidative procedure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reactions in Schemes 1, 2 and 3 are generally performed whilst the phenolic OH groups are protected with a suitable protecting group (PG). For example, methyl can be used as the protecting group. The PG may be removed in the final step leading to compound 9 (as in Scheme 2) or may be removed at an earlier stage in the synthetic sequence. For example, deprotection may be performed at the stage of compound 5. In case PG=methyl, deprotection of compound 5 may be achieved by reaction with boron tribromide to give unprotected bisphenol 20 (see Scheme 4). Compound 20 can be converted to compound 7 (PG=H) and subsequently compound 8 (PG=H) in the same manner as indicated in Scheme 2.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enantiomers of compound 9 may be separated in a conventional way by chiral HPLC using an appropriate chiral HPLC column, for example a Chiralpak AD, OD or AS column, to give single enantiomers 11 and 12, as depicted in Scheme 5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative approach, racemic compound 9 is first converted to bis-acetyl compound 10, which is then separated by chiral HPLC to give single enantiomers 21 and 22. Saponification of the acetyl functionalities of compounds 21 and 22, for example by reaction with lithium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide, gives bisphenols 11 (eutomers) and 12 (distomers) as single enantiomers (see Scheme 5).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sequence of reaction steps starting from compound 7 to yield compounds 11 and 12, as indicated in Schemes 2 and 5, may also be altered, in that compound 7 can also first be deprotected to give bisphenolic compound 23, which may then be acetylated to give compound 24, followed by hydrogenation to give compound 10 as a racemate (see Scheme 6).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEster prodrugs can be made of the parent compounds by esterification of free hydroxyl groups, for example by reaction with an appropriate acid anhydride in pyridine. Thus, compounds 21 and 22 are ester prodrugs of the bisphenols 11 and 12.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives of the present invention are selective ERβ agonists (see Table 7 below). The eutomer compounds 11 show the highest receptor activity.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives of the present invention and their prodrugs or isotopically-labelled derivatives thereof are useful in therapy. As such the tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives of the present invention are useful for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostate hyperplasia, prostate cancer, hot flushes, anxiety, depression, breast cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma, ovarian cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, endometriosis, and colon cancer. In one embodiment, the tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives of the present invention are useful for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostate hyperplasia, prostate cancer, breast cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, and colon cancer. In another embodiment, the tetrahydro-naphthalen-2-ol derivatives of the present invention are useful for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer, more in particular the prevention or treatment of prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further includes a method for the treatment of a mammal, including a human and an animal, suffering from or liable to suffer from any of the aforementioned diseases or disorders, which comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of a tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivative according to the present invention or a prodrug or an isotopically-labelled derivative thereof to a mammal in need thereof. By effective amount or therapeutically effective amount is meant an amount of compound or a composition of the present invention effective in inhibiting the above-noted diseases and thus producing the desired therapeutic, ameliorative, inhibitory or preventative effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to a method of preventing or treating lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostate hyperplasia, prostate cancer, hot flushes, anxiety, depression, breast cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma, ovarian cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, endometriosis, and colon cancer, in particular lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostate hyperplasia, prostate cancer, breast cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, and colon cancer, more in particular lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer, even more particular prostate cancer, comprising administering therapeutically effective amounts of a tetrahydro-naphthalen-2-ol derivative in accordance with the present invention to a mammal in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a still further aspect, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivative in accordance with the present invention in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. With a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is meant one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also relates to a method of preventing or treating lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostate hyperplasia, prostate cancer, hot flushes, anxiety, depression, breast cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma, ovarian cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, endometriosis, and colon cancer, in particular lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostate hyperplasia, prostate cancer, breast cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, and colon cancer, more in particular lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer, even more particular prostate cancer, comprising administering therapeutically effective amounts of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivative in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient in accordance with the present invention to a mammal in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to the use of the tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivative of Formula 2 wherein R1 is methyl, R2 is fluorine, and R3-R13 are H (i.e. compound 11a), for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of prostate cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount of a tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivative of the present invention, also referred to herein as the active ingredient, which is required to achieve a therapeutic effect will, of course, vary with the particular compound, the route of administration, the age and condition of the recipient and the particular disorder or disease being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe exact dose and regimen of administration of the active ingredient, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, may vary with the particular compound, the route of administration, and the age and condition of the individual subject to whom the medicament is to be administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, parenteral administration requires lower dosages than other methods of administration which are more dependent upon absorption. However, a suitable dosage for humans may be 0.0001-5 mg per kilogram body weight, more in particular 0.001-1 mg per kilogram body weight. The desired dose may be presented as one dose or as multiple subdoses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day or as doses to be administered at appropriate daily intervals. It may also be administered once-a-week or once-a-month. The dosage as well as the regimen of administration may differ between a female and a male recipient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhilst it is possible for the active ingredient to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical composition.

4.09 mmol) was suspended in ethyl acetate (200 ml) and H\n2 \ngas was led through the suspension for 30 min. Compound 7a (15.90 g, 40.9 mmol) and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine (20.98 g, 110 mmol) was dissolved in 100 ml ethyl acetate and was added in 6 portions over a period of 2 h. The reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h under continuous bubbling of H\n2\n. Nitrogen was led through the reaction mixture for 30 min. The reaction mixture was filtered over decalite. The filtrate was concentrated to give a colorless oil. NMR showed 72% all cis product, 21% trans products and 7% of the naphthalene product. The crude oil was purified by silica gel chromatography (heptane/ethyl acetate 9/1) to give the compound 8a as a colorless oil (15.04 g, 52%). \n1\nH NMR (CDCl\n3\n): see Table 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n

8a (11.40 g, 29.20 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (250 ml) to obtain a clear colorless solution. This solution was cooled to 0° C. and then boron tribromide (25.3 ml, 263 mmol) was added carefully to give a brown solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h and then poured into ice water (250 ml) and extracted with dichloromethane (2×200 ml). The organic phases were combined, washed with a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (250 ml) and water (250 ml), dried with sodium sulfate and concentrated. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (toluene/ethyl acetate 95:5) to give compound 9a as a yellow oil (7.80 g, 73% yield). \n1\nH NMR (CDCl\n3\n): see Table 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n

Apoptotic cells show nuclear DNA fragmentation and the TUNEL assay end-labels the fragmented DNA by incorporating biotinylated dUTP at the 3′-OH DNA ends using the enzyme Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT). Positively stained cells are counted per acinus (glandular unit) in the ventral prostate. Proliferation of the acinar epithelium of the ventral prostate was determined by immunohistochemical staining with an antibody directed against Ki67 (clone Mib5). Positively stained cells are counted per acinus (glandular unit) in the ventral prostate. Statistical significance is determined as compared to TB alone by one-way ANOVA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor compound 11a a statistically significant (p<0.01) increase in epithelial cell apoptosis was observed in this assay, with a minimal active dose (MAD) of 3 μg/kg. At this dose a decrease in epithelial cell proliferation was observed as compared to TB-alone treated rats.\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\n \n \n \nA number of compounds 9, 11 and 12 were tested on metabolic stability in human hepatocytes. The hepatic stability was compared to corresponding chroman compounds 25, 26 or 27 (see structures below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest compounds were diluted to 3 μM in incubation medium. Then 40 μl of the 3 μM test compounds was pipetted into a 96 well microtiter plate (flat bottom). Hepatocytes (stored at −140° C.) were thawed in a 37° C. water bath. The cells were resuspended into pre-warmed thawing medium and were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 50 g at room temperature. The supernatant was discarded and the remaining cell pellet was resuspended in warm incubation medium and diluted to 7.5 E5 cells/ml. Then 80 μl of the cell suspension was added to each well of the 96 well microtiter plate containing the test compounds. The resulting mixture was incubated at 37° C. and was sampled at t=0, 5, 30, 60, and 120 min. The samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS to determine the content of unchanged test compound. Based on the rate of reduction of the content of test compound over time, the half-live (T½) was calculated. The hepatic stability is summarized in Table 8.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetabolic stability in human hepatocytes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol\n\n\nHuman hepatocyte T 1/2 (min)\n\n\nChroman (‡)\n\n\nHuman hepatocyte T 1/2 (min)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n9b\n\n\n70.0\n\n\n25b\n\n\n44.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9j\n\n\n37.4\n\n\n25j\n\n\n40.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9o\n\n\n73.2\n\n\n25o\n\n\n71.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9p\n\n\n>120\n\n\n25p\n\n\n48.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9r\n\n\n57.9\n\n\n25r\n\n\n24.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9s\n\n\n96.5\n\n\n25s\n\n\n56.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9v\n\n\n69.8\n\n\n25v\n\n\n53.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9y\n\n\n109.6\n\n\n25v\n\n\n58.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11a\n\n\n40.5\n\n\n26a\n\n\n35.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11b\n\n\n40.7\n\n\n26b\n\n\n35.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11i\n\n\n29.4\n\n\n26i\n\n\n26.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11q\n\n\n82.2\n\n\n26q\n\n\n45.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12a\n\n\n66.9\n\n\n27a\n\n\n33.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12i\n\n\n67.1\n\n\n27i\n\n\n45.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12i\n\n\n33.7\n\n\n27i\n\n\n24.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12q\n\n\n>120\n\n\n27q\n\n\n47.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(‡) the one-letter extension in the codes of chromans 25, 26 and 27 indicates the substitution pattern of the compounds.
