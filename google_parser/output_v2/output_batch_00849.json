Description\n\n\n\n\n AURORA KINASE INHIBITORS\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/068,051, filed March 4, 2008, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe Aurora kinases are serine/threonine protein kinases, which play critical roles in the regulation of the cell cycle, especially in the late stages from the G2/M check point through the mitotic checkpoint and late mitosis. Three Aurora kinases are expressed in mammals, namely, Aurora A, B and C. Aurora-A, which localizes to centrosomes and spindle poles, has a major role in centrosome maturation and spindle assembly functioning to ensure faithful segregation of chromosomes into daughter cell. Aurora-B, a chromosome passenger protein, is associated with centromeres during prometaphase and with the spindle midzone during anaphase and telophase. It is required for histone H3 phosphorylation, correct chromosome orientation, chromosomal congression, the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and cytokinesis. Aurora-C, another chromosome passenger protein, may play specific roles in male meiosis. The Aurora kinases are expressed at low level in most tissues but are highly expressed in mitotically active cells such as bone marrow, intestine, spleen, testis and thymus. Aurora A and B are only expressed and are only active as kinases during mitosis.\n\n\nAurora A and B are frequently overexpressed in many cancer cells, including breast, lung, colon, ovarian and pancreatic cells. Overexpression of Aurora A has been shown to compromise the checkpoint function that monitors spindle assembly, allowing anaphase to occur despite continued activation of the spindle checkpoint. Overexpression of Aurora B has been reported to cause endoreduplication resulting multi-nuclearity. Some evidence also suggests that overexpression of Aurora B may induce aggressive metastasis. These findings suggest that inhibition of Aurora kinases' activity may have therapeutic benefit in the treatment of cancer. Indeed, a \n\n number of small molecule Aurora kinase inhibitors, including VX-680, PHA- 739358, AZDl 152, MLN8054, and R763 have entered human clinical trials for suppression of tumor growth.\n\n\nThere is still a need for new Aurora kinase inhibitors with improved properties, such as potency.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIt has now been found that compounds represented by Structural Formula (I) are potent inhibitors of Aurora kinase A and B and cancer cell growth. For example, Compounds 1-6 (synthesized in Examples 2-7) have an IC\n50\n less than 10 nM against Aurora kinase A and less than 1.0 nM against Aurora kinase B (see Example 10). Moreover, these compounds inhibited growth of cancer cells in cell culture (see Example 1 1). Based on this discovery, novel Aurora kinase inhibitors, pharmaceutical compositions comprising these inhibitors and methods of treating a subject with cancer by administrating these inhibitors are disclosed herein.\n\n\nOne embodiment is an Aurora kinase inhibitor represented by Structural Formula (I):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable salt of Aurora kinase inhibitor represented by Structural Formula (I) are also included.

The invention encompasses all enantiomerically-pure, enantiomerically-enriched, diastereomerically pure, diastereomerically enriched, and racemic mixtures, and diastereomeric mixtures of the disclosed Aurora kinase inhibitors which have chiral center(s). Enantiomeric and diastereomeric mixtures can be resolved into their component enantiomers or stereoisomers by well known methods, such as chiral- phase gas chromatography, chiral-phase high performance liquid chromatography, crystallizing the compound as a chiral salt complex, or crystallizing the compound in a chiral solvent. Enantiomers and diastereomers can also be obtained from diastereomerically- or enantiomerically-pure intermediates, reagents, and catalysts by well known asymmetric synthetic methods.\n\n\nWhen the stereochemistry of the disclosed Aurora kinase inhibitors are named or depicted by structure, the named or depicted stereoisomer is at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 99% or 99.9% by weight pure relative to the other stereoisomers. When a single stereoisomer is named or depicted by structure, the depicted or named stereoisomer is at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 99% or 99.9% pure. Percent purity by \n\n weight is the ratio of the weight of the named stereoisomer over the weight of the named stereoisomer plus the weight of its stereoisomers.\n\n\nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of the Aurora kinase inhibitors disclosed herein are included in the present invention. For example, an acid salt of an Aurora kinase inhibitor containing an amine or other basic group can be obtained by reacting the compound with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, resulting in pharmaceutically acceptable anionic salt forms. Examples of anionic salts include the acetate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bitartrate, bromide, calcium edetate, camsylate, carbonate, chloride, citrate, dihydrochloride, edetate, edisylate, estolate, esylate, fumarate, glyceptate, gluconate, glutamate, glycollylarsanilate, hexylresorcinate, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroxynaphthoate, iodide, isethionate, lactate, lactobionate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, methylsulfate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate, pamoate, pantothenate, phosphate/diphospate, polygalacturonate, salicylate, stearate, subacetate, succinate, sulfate, tannate, tartrate, teoclate, tosylate, and triethiodide salts.\n\n\nSalts of the Aurora kinase inhibitors containing an acidic functional group can be prepared by reacting with a suitable base. Such a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be made with a base which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable cation, which includes alkali metal salts (especially sodium and potassium), alkaline earth metal salts (especially calcium and magnesium), aluminum salts and ammonium salts, as well as salts made from physiologically acceptable organic bases such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, morpholine, pyridine, piperidine, picoline, dicyclohexylamine, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, 2- hydroxyethylamine, bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, tri-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, procaine, dibenzylpiperidine, dehydroabietylamine, N,N'-bisdehydroabietylamine, glucamine, N-methylglucamine, collidine, quinine, quinoline, and basic amino acids such as lysine and arginine.\n\n\nWhen a disclosed Aurora kinase inhibitor is named or depicted by structure, it is to be understood that solvates (e.g., hydrates) of the Aurora kinase inhibitor or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts are also included. \"Solvates\" refer to crystalline \n\n forms wherein solvent molecules are incorporated into the crystal lattice during crystallization. Solvate may include water or nonaqueous solvents such as ethanol, isopropanol, DMSO, acetic acid, ethanolamine, and EtOAc. Solvates, wherein water is the solvent molecule incorporated into the crystal lattice, are typically referred to as \"hydrates\". Hydrates include stoichiometric hydrates as well as compositions containing variable amounts of water.\n\n\nWhen a disclosed Aurora kinase inhibitor is named or depicted by structure, it is to be understood that the compound, including solvates thereof, may exist in crystalline forms, non-crystalline forms or a mixture thereof. The Aurora kinase inhibitor or solvates may also exhibit polymorphism (i.e. the capacity to occur in different crystalline forms). These different crystalline forms are typically known as \"polymorphs.\" It is to be understood that when named or depicted by structure, the disclosed Aurora kinase inhibitors and solvates (e.g., hydrates) also include all polymorphs thereof. Polymorphs have the same chemical composition but differ in packing, geometrical arrangement, and other descriptive properties of the crystalline solid state. Polymorphs, therefore, may have different physical properties such as shape, density, hardness, deformability, stability, and dissolution properties. Polymorphs typically exhibit different melting points, IR spectra, and X-ray powder diffraction patterns, which may be used for identification. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that different polymorphs may be produced, for example, by changing or adjusting the conditions used in solidfying the compound. For example, changes in temperature, pressure, or solvent may result in different polymorphs. In addition, one polymorph may spontaneously convert to another polymorph under certain conditions.\n\n\nCancers that can be treated or prevented by the methods of the present invention include lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, brain cancer, neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, melanoma, glioblastoma multiform, ovarian cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma, sarcoma, paraneoplasia, osteosarcoma, germinoma, glioma and mesothelioma. In one specific embodiment, the cancer is lung cancer, colon cancer, brain cancer, neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, melanoma, glioblastoma mutiform or ovarian cancer. In another specific embodiment, the \n\n cancer is lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, brain cancer, neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, melanoma, glioblastoma multiform or ovarian cancer. In yet another specific embodiment, the cancer is a breast cancer. In yet another specific embodiment, the cancer is a basal sub-type breast cancer or a luminal B sub-type breast cancer. In yet another specific embodiment, the cancer is a soft tissue cancer. A \"soft tissue cancer\" is an art-recognized term that encompasses tumors derived from any soft tissue of the body. Such soft tissue connects, supports, or surrounds various structures and organs of the body, including, but not limited to, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, tendons, fibrous tissues, fatty tissue, blood and lymph vessels, perivascular tissue, nerves, mesenchymal cells and synovial tissues. Thus, soft tissue cancers can be of fat tissue, muscle tissue, nerve tissue, joint tissue, blood vessels, lymph vessels, and fibrous tissues. Soft tissue cancers can be benign or malignant. Generally, malignant soft tissue cancers are referred to as sarcomas, or soft tissue sarcomas. There are many types of soft tissue tumors, including lipoma, lipoblastoma, hibernoma, liposarcoma, leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neurofibroma, schwannoma (neurilemoma), neuroma, malignant schwannoma, neurofibrosarcoma, neurogenic sarcoma, nodular tenosynovitis, synovial sarcoma, hemangioma, glomus tumor, hemangiopericytoma, hemangioendothelioma, angiosarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma, lymphangioma, fibroma, elastofibroma, superficial fibromatosis, fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosarcoma, fibromatosis, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), myxoma, granular cell tumor, malignant mesenchymomas, alveolar soft-part sarcoma, epithelioid sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, and desmoplastic small cell tumor. In a particular embodiment, the soft tissue cancer is a sarcoma selected from the group consisting of a fibrosarcoma, a gastrointestinal sarcoma, a leiomyosarcoma, a dedifferentiated liposarcoma, a pleomorphic liposarcoma, a malignant fibrous histiocytoma, a round cell sarcoma, and a synovial sarcoma.\n\n\nThe term \"effective amount\" of an Aurora kinase inhibitor disclosed herein is a quantity sufficient to, when administered to the subject, including a mammal, for example a human, effect beneficial or desired results, including clinical results. An \" effective amount\" of a disclosed Aurora kinase inhibitor is an amount which prevents, inhibits, suppresses or reduces the cancer (e.g., as determined by clinical \n\n symptoms or the amount of cancer cells) in a subject as compared to a control. Specifically, \"treating a subject with a cancer\" includes achieving, partially or substantially, one or more of the following: arresting the growth or spread of a cancer, reducing the extent of a cancer (e.g., reducing size of a tumor or reducing the number of affected sites), inhibiting the growth rate of a cancer, and ameliorating or improving a clinical symptom or indicator associated with a cancer (such as tissue or serum components). \"Treating a subject with a cancer\" also includes prophylactic treatment.\n\n\nGenerally, an effective amount of an disclosed Aurora kinase inhibitor varies depending upon various factors, such as the given drug or compound, the pharmaceutical formulation, the route of administration, the type of disease or disorder, the identity of the subject or host being treated, and the like, but can nevertheless be routinely determined by one skilled in the art. As defined herein, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention may be readily determined by one of ordinary skill by routine methods known in the art.\n\n\nIn an embodiment, an effective amount of a disclosed Aurora kinase inhibitor ranges from about 0.1 to about 15 mg/kg body weight, suitably about 1 to about 5 mg/kg body weight, and more suitably, from about 2 to about 3 mg/kg body weight. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage required to effectively treat a subject suffering from cancer and these factors include, but are not limited to, the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject and other diseases present. Moreover, a \"treatment\" regime of a subject with an effective amount of a disclosed Aurora kinase inhibitor may consist of a single administration, or alternatively comprise a series of applications. For example, the compound of the present invention may be administered at least once a week. However, in another embodiment, the Aurora kinase inhibitor may be administered to the subject from about one time per week to once daily for a given treatment. The length of the treatment period depends on a variety of factors, such as the severity of the disease, the age of the patient, the concentration and the activity of the Aurora kinase inhibitor, or a combination thereof. It will also be appreciated that the effective dosage of the Aurora kinase inhibitor used for the treatment or prophylaxis may \n\n increase or decrease over the course of a particular treatment or prophylaxis regime. Changes in dosage may result and become apparent by standard diagnostic assays known in the art. In some instances, chronic administration may be required.\n\n\nAs used herein, \"treatment\" is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results, including clinical results. Beneficial or desired clinical results can include, but are not limited to, alleviation or amelioration of one or more symptoms or conditions, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e. not worsening) state of disease, preventing spread of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. \"Treatment\" can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment.\n\n\nA \"subject\" is a mammal, preferably a human, but can also be an animal in need of veterinary treatment, e.g., companion animals (e.g., dogs, cats, and the like), farm animals (e.g., cows, sheep, pigs, horses, and the like) and laboratory animals (e.g., rats, mice, guinea pigs, and the like).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the method of the present invention is a mono-therapy where the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are administered alone. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the compound of the invention is the only pharmaceutically active ingredient in the pharmaceutical compositions or the only pharmaceutically active ingredient administered to the subject.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the method of the invention is a co-therapy with one or more of other therapeutically active drugs or therapies known in the art for treating the desired diseases or indications. In one example, one or more other antiproliferative or anticancer therapies are combined with the compounds of the invention. In another example, the compounds disclosed herein are co-administered with one or more of other anticancer drugs known in the art. Anticancer therapies that may be used in combination with the compound of the invention include surgery, radiotherapy (including, but not limited to, gamma-radiation, neutron beam radiotherapy, electron beam radiotherapy, proton therapy, brachytherapy, and systemic radioactive isotopes) and endocrine therapy. Anticancer agents that may be used in combination with the the compounds of the invention include biologic response modifiers (including, but not limited to, interferons, interleukins, and tumor \n\n necrosis factor (TNF)), hyperthermia and cryotherapy, agents to attenuate any adverse effects (e.g., antiemetics), and other approved chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g. taxol and analogs thereof).\n\n\nExamples of anti-cancer agents which can be co-administered with the disclosed Aurora kinase inhibitors include abarelix, alitretinoin, allopurinol, altretamine, amifostine, anakinra, anastrozole, arsenic trioxide, asparaginase, azacitidine, BCG Live, bevacuzimab, bexarotene, bleomycin, bortezomib, busulfan, calusterone, capecitabine, carboplatin, carmustine, celecoxib, cetuximab, chlorambucil, cisplatin, cladribine, clofarabine, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, dacarbazine, dactinomycin, ctinomycin D, dalteparin sodium, darbepoetin alfa, dasatinib, daunorubicin, daunomycin, decitabine, denileukin, dexrazoxane, docetaxel, doxorubicin, dromostanlone propionate, eculizumab, Elliott's B Solution, epirubicin, epoetin alfa, erlotinib, estramustine, etoposide, exemestane, fentanyl citrate, Filgrastim, floxuridine (intraarterial), fludarabine, fulvestrant, gefitinib, gemcitabine, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, goserelin acetate, histrelin acetate, hydroxyurea,\n\n\nIbritumomab Tiuxetan, idarubicin, ifosfamide, imatinib mesylate, Interferon alfa-2b, irinotecan, lapatinib ditosylate, lenalidomide, letrozole, leucovorin, Leuprolide Acetate, levamisole, lomustine, CCNU, meclorethamine, nitrogen mustard, megestrol acetate, melphalan, L-PAM, mercaptopurine, 6-MP, mesna, methotrexate, methoxsalen, mitomycin C, mitotane, mitoxantrone, nandrolone phenpropionate, nelarabine, Nofetumomab, Oprelvekin, oprelvekin, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, palifermin, pamidronate, panitumumab, pegademase, pegaspargase, Pegfϊlgrastim, Peginterferon alfa-2b, pemetrexed disodium, pentostatin, pipobroman, plicamycin, mithramycin, porfimer sodium, procarbazine, quinacrine, Rasburicase, Rituximab, Sargramostim, sorafenib, streptozocin, sunitinib, talc, tamoxifen, temozolomide, teniposide, VM-26, testolactone, thalidomide, thioguanine, 6-TG, thiotepa, topotecan, toremifene, Tositumomab, trastuzumab, tretinoin, ATRA, Uracil Mustard, valrubicin, vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine, vorinostat and zoledronate.\n\n\nWhen the compounds of the invention are combined with other anticancer drugs, they can be administered contemperaneously. As used herein, \"administered contemporaneously\" means that two substances are administered to a subject such \n\n that they are both biologically active in the subject at the same time. The exact details of the administration will depend on the pharmacokinetics of the two substances in the presence of each other, and can include administering one substance within a period of time of one another, e.g., 24 hours of administration of the other, if the pharmacokinetics are suitable. Designs of suitable dosing regimens are routine for one skilled in the art. In particular embodiments, two substances will be administered substantially simultaneously, i.e. within minutes of each other, or in a single composition that comprises both substances. Alternatively, the two agents can be administered separately, such that only one is biologically active in the subject at the same time.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention can be administered to a patient in a variety of forms depending on the selected route of administration, as will be understood by those skilled in the art. The compounds of the invention may be administered, for example, by oral, parenteral, buccal, sublingual, nasal, rectal, patch, pump or transdermal administration and the pharmaceutical compositions formulated accordingly. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, transepithelial, nasal, intrapulmonary, intrathecal, rectal and topical modes of administration. Parenteral administration can be by continuous infusion over a selected period of time. Oral and parenteral administration are most commonly used.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention can be suitably formulated into pharmaceutical compositions for administration to a subject. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention optionally include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents therefor, such as lactose, starch, cellulose and dextrose. Other excipients, such as flavoring agents; sweeteners; and preservatives, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl parabens, can also be included. More complete listings of suitable excipients can be found in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (5\nth\n Ed., Pharmaceutical Press (2005)). A person skilled in the art would know how to prepare formulations suitable for various types of administration routes. Conventional procedures and ingredients for the selection and preparation of suitable formulations are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (2003 - 20th edition) and in The United States \n\n Pharmacopeia: The National Formulary (USP 24 NFl 9) published in 1999. The carriers, diluents and/or excipients are \"acceptable\" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Typically, for oral therapeutic administration, a compound of the invention may be incorporated with excipient and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like.\n\n\nTypically for parenteral administration, solutions of a compound of the invention can generally be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, DMSO and mixtures thereof with or without alcohol, and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.\n\n\nTypically, for injectable use, sterile aqueous solutions or dispersion of, and sterile powders of, a compound of the invention for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions.\n\n\nFor nasal administration, the disclosed Aurora kinase inhibitors can be formulated as aerosols, drops, gels and powders. Aerosol formulations typically comprise a solution or fine suspension of the active substance in a physiologically acceptable aqueous or non-aqueous solvent and are usually presented in single or multidose quantities in sterile form in a sealed container, which can take the form of a cartridge or refill for use with an atomizing device. Alternatively, the sealed container may be a unitary dispensing device such as a single dose nasal inhaler or an aerosol dispenser fitted with a metering valve which is intended for disposal after use. Where the dosage form comprises an aerosol dispenser, it will contain a propellant which can be a compressed gas such as compressed air or an organic propellant such as fluorochlorohydrocarbon. The aerosol dosage forms can also take the form of a pump-atomizer.\n\n\nFor buccal or sublingual administration, the disclosed Aurora kinase inhibitors can be formulated with with a carrier such as sugar, acacia, tragacanth, or gelatin and glycerine, as tablets, lozenges or pastilles. \n\n For rectal administration, the disclosed Aurora kinase inhibitors can be formulated in the form of suppositories containing a conventional suppository base such as cocoa butter.\n\n\nThe disclosed Aurora kinase inhibitors can be formulated alone or for contemporaneous adminstration with other agents for treating cancer. Therefore, in another aspect, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent, an Aurora kinase inhibitordisclosed herein or a pharmacuetically acceptable salt thereof and another anti-cancer agent.\n\n\nThe invention is illustrated by the following examples which are not intended to be limiting in any way.\n\n\nThe following abbreviations have the indicated meanings:\n\n\nAbbreviation Meaning\n\n\nBoc /er/-butoxy carbonyl or t-butoxy carbonyl\n\n\n(Boc)\n2\nO di-tert-buty\\ dicarbonate\n\n\nCbz Benzyloxycarbonyl\n\n\nCbzCl Benzyl chloroformate\n\n\nDAST diethylaminosulfur trifluoride\n\n\nDBU l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene\n\n\nDCC N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide\n\n\nDCU N,N'-dicyclohexylurea\n\n\nDIAD diisopropyl azodicarboxylate\n\n\nDIEA N,N-diisopropylethylamine\n\n\nDMAP 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine\n\n\nDMF N,N-dimethylformamide\n\n\nDMPU l ,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(lH)-pyrimidinone \n\n 2,4-DNP 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine\n\n\nDPTBS Diphenyl-t-butylsilyl\n\n\nEDCHCl, EDCI l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride\n\n\nEquiv equivalents\n\n\nFmoc l-[[(9H-fluoren-9-ylmethoxy)carbonyl]oxy]-\n\n\nFmoc-OSu l-[[(9H-fluoren-9-ylmethoxy)carbonyl]oxy]-2,5- pyrrolidinedione h, hr hour(s)\n\n\nHOBt 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole\n\n\nHATU 2-(7-Aza- 1 H-benzotriazole- 1 -yl)- 1.1 ,33-tetramethyluronium hexafl uorophosphate\n\n\nHBTU 2-( 1 H-Benzotriazol- 1 -yl)- 1 , 1 ,3 ,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate\n\n\nKHMDS potassium hexamethyldisilazane\n\n\nLAH or LiAlH\n4\n lithium aluminum hydride\n\n\nLC-MS liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy\n\n\nLHMDS lithium hexamethyldisilazane\n\n\nMe methyl\n\n\nMsCl methanesulfonyl chloride\n\n\nMin minute\n\n\nMS mass spectrum\n\n\nNaH sodium hydride\n\n\nNaHCO\n3\n sodium bicarbonate\n\n\nNaN\n3\n sodium azide\n\n\nNaOH sodium hydroxide \n\n Na\n2\nSO\n4\n sodium sulfate\n\n\nNMM N-methylmorpholine\n\n\nNMP N-methylpyrrolidinone\n\n\nPd\n2\n(dba)\n3\n tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0)\n\n\nPE petroleum ether\n\n\nQuant quantitative yield\n\n\nSatd saturated\n\n\nSOCl\n2\n thionyl chloride\n\n\nSPA scintillation proximity assay\n\n\nSPE solid phase extraction\n\n\nTBAF tetrabutylammonium fluoride\n\n\nTBS t-butyldimethylsilyl\n\n\nTBDPS t-butyldiphenylsilyl\n\n\nTBSCl t-butyldimethylsilyl chloride\n\n\nTBDPSCl t-butyldiphenylsilyl chloride\n\n\nTEA triethylamine or Et\n3\nN\n\n\nTEMPO 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy free radical\n\n\nTeoc l-[2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyloxy]-\n\n\nTeoc-OSu l-[2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyloxy]pyrrolidin-2,5-dione\n\n\nTFA trifluoroacetic acid\n\n\nTie, TLC thin layer chromatography\n\n\nTMS trimethylsilyl\n\n\nTMSCl chlorotrimethylsilane or trimethylsilyl chloride\n\n\nIR retention time TsOH p-toluenesulfonic acid \n\n GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SYNTHETIC METHODS Compounds of the Formula I can be prepared by several processes. In the discussion below s, X, Y, Ring A, R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3a\n, R\n3b\n, R\n3ς\n and R\n4\n have the meanings indicated above unless otherwise noted. In cases where the synthetic intermediates and final products of Formula I described below contain potentially reactive functional groups, for example amino, hydroxyl, thiol and carboxylic acid groups, that may interfere with the desired reaction, it may be advantageous to employ protected forms of the intermediate. Methods for the selection, introduction and subsequent removal of protecting groups are well known to those skilled in the art. (T.W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts \"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis\" John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York 1999). Such protecting group manipulations are assumed in the discussion below and not described explicitly. Generally, reagents in the reaction schemes are used in equimolar amounts; however, in certain cases it may be desirable to use an excess of one reagent to drive a reaction to completion. This is especially the case when the excess reagent can be readily removed by evaporation or extraction. Bases employed to neutralize HCl in reaction mixtures are generally used in slight to substantial excess (1.05 - 5 equivalents).\n\n\nIn the first process, a compound of Formula I can be prepared by Suzuki or Stille reactions of an intermediate of Formula XIV, wherein Gl is Br, I, Cl or OTf, with a reagent of Formula XV, wherein G2 is boronic acid, boronic ester or alkyltin. Reagents of Formula XV are either commercially available or can be prepared readily from commercially available precursors based on literature precedents. Gl and G2 can be reversed if so desired. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntermediates of Formula XIV can be prepared by amide coupling between an acid of Formula XVI with an amine of Formula XVII.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntermediates of Formula XVI can be prepared by displacement of G3 in an intermediate of Formula XVIII, wherein G3 is Cl, Br, I or OTf, with an amine of Formula XIX.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXVIII XIX\n\n\nXVI \n\n Alternatively, Intermediates of Formula XIV can be prepared by displacement of G3 in an intermediate of Formula XVIII, wherein G3 is Cl, Br, I or OTf, with an amine of Formula XIXa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntermediates of Formula XIXa in turn can be prepared by reaction of an acid of Formula XIX with an amine of Formula XVII.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXIXa\n\n\nIntermediates of Formula XVIII can be prepared from commercially available alcohols of Formula XX using POC13, P0Br3, or Tf20 etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXX XVlIl\n\n\nOr alcohols of Formula XX wherein X = N can be prepared from anilines XXa (Baker et al.

The full-length human Aurora A carrying His\n6\n tag at the N-terminus (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the full-length human Aurora B (N-terminal GST fusion) co-expressed and co-purified with the HiS\n6\n-INCENP INBOX, aminoacids 803-918 (Carna BioSciences, Japan) were used as the enzyme in the assays. Tested compounds were diluted in DMSO and pre-incubated with the enzyme and ATP/Mg\n2+\n mixture for at least 10 minutes. The reaction was started by addition of the Kemptide peptide substrate (LRRASLG) and allowed to proceed for 45 min at room temperature. Each reaction in a final volume of 40 μl contained 50 μM Kemptide, 10 μM [γ-\n33\nP]ATP (1 Ci/mmol) and either 1 1 nM Aurora A or 1.5 nM Aurora B/INCENP complex in the buffer containing 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 5% DMSO, 20 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mM β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na\n3\nVO\n4\n and either 0.1 mg/ml of BSA and 1 mM DTT for Aurora A or 0.01 % Triton-XIOO and 2 mM DTT for Aurora B. The reaction was stopped with 25 μl of 5% H\n3\nPO\n4\n, and 45 \n\n μl of the mixture was transferred into a MultiScreen-PH filterplate (Millipore) pre- washed with 0.85% H\n3\nPO\n4\n. The filterplate was washed 4 times with 200 μl of 0.85% H\n3\nPO\n4\n on a vacuum manifold. Scintillation fluid (50 μl of Ultima Gold™ LLT, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) was added to each well, and after 1-hr incubation at room temperature the plates were counted on MicroBeta (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) plate reader. Incubation with 5% DMSO in the absence of inhibitors was used as a non-inhibited control, and the reaction mixture lacking Kemptide was used as a fully inhibited control. Percent inhibition values were calculated based on the counts of the positive and negative controls, and these values were regressed against inhibitor concentration and fit into a four parameter model. From this fit the IC\n5\nO values (the inhibitor concentration at which 50% inhibition occurs) were derived as the inflection point on the semi-logarithm inhibition curve. Aurora kinase A and B IC\n50\nS for a number of the disclosed compounds are shown below in Table 1. For reference purposes, the IC\n5\nos of AZDl 152HQPA and VX-680, two Aurora kinase inhibitors known in the prior art and in clinical development, are also included in Table 1.

The homogeneous assay procedure involves addition of a single reagent directly to cells cultured in serum-supplemented medium. The homogeneous format results in cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal proportional to the amount of ATP present. The CellTiter-Glo® Assay relies on the properties of a proprietary thermostable luciferase (Ultra-Glo. Recombinant Luciferase), which generates a stable glow-type Luminescent signal. The half-life of the luminescent signal resulting from this reaction is greater than five hours. This extended half-life eliminates the need for reagent injectors and provides flexibility for continuous or batch-mode processing of multiple plates. The unique homogeneous format reduces pipeting errors that may be introduced during the multiple steps required by other ATP-measurement methods.\n\n\nProtocol for the Cell Viability Assay:\n\n\n96 Well cell culture plates were seeded with with 10\n3\n mammalian cells (Colo205, HL-60, SW620, HCTl 16, MCF-7 and MV-41 1) in lOOμl culture medium. The cells were incubated overnight prior to initiating the assay. Control wells were prepared on a plate containing medium only to obtain a value for background luminescence.\n\n\nCompounds to be tested were added to experimental wells and incubated for 72hrs (Colo205, HL-60, MV-41 1), 168hrs (HCTl 16. SW620) or 240hrs (MCF-7). Wells were also set up to as vehicle controls with the addition of 0.1 % DMSO. At the end of the incubation period, the plates were equilibrated to room temperature for approximately 30 minutes.\n\n\nLyophilized CellTiter-Glo® Substrate and the CellTiter-Glo® Buffer were warmed to room temperature. The CellTiter-Glo® Buffer was mixed with the\n\n\nCellTiter-Glo® Substrate to reconstitute the lyophilized enzyme/substrate mixture. This forms the CellTiter-Glo® Reagent. The contents were mixed by gently \n\n vortexing, swirling or by inverting the contents to obtain a homogeneous solution. l OOμl of CellTiter-Glo® Reagent was added to the cell culture medium present in each well. The contents were mixed for 2 minutes on an orbital shaker to induce cell lysis. The plates were allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes to stabilize luminescent signal. The contents of the 96 well cell culture plate were then transferred to a white 96 well Optiplate (Perkin Elmer). The luminescence was recorded on Wallac 1420 VICTOR\n2\n V Multilabel Platereader (An integration time of 0.25-1 second per well).\n\n\nPreparation of test compounds:\n\n\n1OmM DMSO stock Compounds were serially diluted threefold in DMSO. Subsequent dilutions wmade into cell culture media prior to addition to cells to maintain the DMSO concentration at or below 0.1% to avoid cell toxicity.\n\n\nThe IC\n5O\ns of compounds of the invention and AZDl 152HQPA and VX-680, two Aurora kinase inhibitors known in the prior art and in clinical development, are also included in Table 2. The IC\n50\nS in Table 2 are the concentration at which 50% growth inhibition relative to control occurs. \n\n\n\n\nTable 2 - Cell assay data: Results are expressed as IC50 (nM).\n\n\nCompound Colo205 HL-60 SW620 HCTl 16 MCF-7 MV-411\n\n\nTaxol 2.54nM 2.16nM 4.9InM 2.04nM 0.58nM 6.2nM\n\n\nCompound 1 1.82nm 1.32nM 12.0InM 5.32nM 16.9InM 5.75nM\n\n\nCompound 2 3.98nM 1.8nM 6.3nM 3.65nM 8.46nM 5.2nM\n\n\nCompound 3 2.26nM 1.08nM 2.15nM 4.58nM 5.62nM 5.9nM\n\n\nCompound 4 2.1InM 1.32nM 7.8InM 5.66nM 7.7nM 6.05nM\n\n\nCompound 5 3.86nM 1.2InM 2.17nM 1.9nM 11.42nM 6.4nM\n\n\nCompound 6 3.9nM 2.26nM 2.4nM 1.9nM 7.8nM 5.79nM\n\n\nCompound 9 9.88nM 4.38nM\n\n\nCompound 10 5.35nM 1.57nM\n\n\nCompound 11 2.9OnM 1.62nM\n\n\nCompound 12 7.82nM 3.98nM\n\n\nCompound 13 9.39nM 6.43nM\n\n\nCompound 14 8.1InM 5.75nM\n\n\nCompound 15 3.07nM 1.7InM\n\n\nAZD1152HQPA22.98nM 7.16nM 20.9InM 14.35nM 60.74nM 16.5nM\n\n\nVX-680 30.22nM 13.77nM 21.8InM 17.97nM 3InM 79nM\n\n\nColo205: Colorectal cancer HL-60: Leukemia SW620: Colorectal cancer HCTl 16: Colorectal cancer MCF-7: Breast Cancer MV-411: Leukemia \n\n\n\n\nWhile this invention has been particularly shown and described with references to example embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention encompassed by the appended claims."
