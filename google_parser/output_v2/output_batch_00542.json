Description\n\n\n\n\n Novel 4-(aryl-4-sulfonyl)-6,6a,7,8,9,10-hexahydro-4H-4,8,10a-triaza- acephenanthrylene and 3-arylsulfonyl-6,6a,7,8,9,10-hexahydro-3H-3,8,10a- triaza-cyclopenta[c]fluorene derivatives as serotonin 5-HT\n6\n ligands Field of the Invention \n\n\n The present invention provides compounds that are serotonin 5-HT\n6\n ligands, and as such are useful to treat neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising \n\n\ncompounds of the invention and methods of treating disorders using the compounds of the invention. \n\n\nBackground \n\n\n Cognitive dysfunction is a feature of various forms of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a core feature of schizophrenia (see e.g. Peuskens, J.; Demily, C; Thibaut, F. Clin. Ther. 2005, 27, S25; BowieChristopher, R.; Jaga, K. Expert Rev. Neurother. 2007, 7, 281 ; Kuperberg, G.; Heckers, S. Curr. Opin. \n\n\nNeurobiol. 2000, 10, 205; Galletly, C. A.; Clark, C. R.; MacFarlane, A. C. J. \n\n\nPsychiatry Neurosci. 2000, 25, 1 17). There is a need for novel agents for cognitive enhancement in these CNS diseases and many different therapeutic targets have been pursued in order to develop these (Robichaud, A. J. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2006, 6, 553). \n\n\n The 5-HT\n6\n receptor was first cloned in 1993 and is one of the most recently discovered 5-HT receptor subtypes and is an emerging therapeutic target for cognitive enhancement (Monsma, F. J., Jr.; Shen, Y.; Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W.; Sibley, D. R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993, 43, 320 ; Ruat, M.; Traiffort, E.; Arrang, J. M.; Tardivel-Lacombe, J.; Diaz, J.; Leurs, R.; Schwartz, J. C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993, 193, 268). The 5-HT\n6\n receptor is a member of the G-protein superfamily, and is positively coupled to adenylate cyclase. It is localized almost exclusively in the brain, including areas important for memory and learning e.g. the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and also in the nucleus accumbens, striatum, olfactory tubercle, substantia nigra, and hippocampus of the brain (Ward et al., Neuroscience, 1995, 64:1 105). The unique brain-selective localization together with \n\n the observation of high affinity of therapeutically important atypical antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants for this receptor have stimulated significant interest in its pathophysiological function and potential therapeutic utilities in CNS diseases (Woolley, M. L; Marsden, C. A.; Fone, K. C. F. Curr. Drug Target CNS Neurol. Disord. 2004, 3, 59). Numerous in vivo studies have shown that blockade of 5-HT\n6\n receptor function improves cognition in a number of rodent behavioral models. In addition, in vivo microdialysis studies have shown that 5-HT\n6\n receptor antagonism enhances neurotransmission at cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons, as well as in other pathways. Therefore, it can be suggested that antagonism of the 5-HT\n6\n receptor can potentially provide an effective treatment for cognitive impairment in AD and schizophrenia (Mitchell, E. S.; Neumaier, J. F. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005, 108, 320). \n\n\nWO 2008/147812 discloses 4'-substituted compounds having 5-HT\n6\n receptor affinity with the general formula P1 exemplified with the compound P1 , ex as selective 5-HT\n6\n receptor ligands for the treatment of certain neurologic and psychiatric disorders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ^ P1 , ex \n\n\n WO 02/102774 discloses 4-piperazinylindole derivatives having 5-HT\n6\n receptor affinity with the general formula P2 exemplified with the compound P2, ex as selective 5-HT\n6\n receptor antagonists for the treatment of disorders of the CNS, particularly wherein the disease state comprises psychoses, schizophrenia, \n\n manic depressions, neurological disorders, memory disorders, attention deficit disorder, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n P2, ex \n\n\nWO 02/32863 discloses 2-, 3-, 4- or 5-substituted N1 - (benzenesulfonylindoles) having 5-HT\n6\n receptor affinity with the general formula P3 exemplified formula P3, ex as 5-HT\n6\n antagonists for treating obesity and \n\n\nneurological, mental and cognitive disorders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWO 02/32562 discloses 1 -aryl or 1 -alkylsulfonyl-heterocyclylbenzazole derivatives having 5-HT\n6\n affinity with the general formulas P4A and P4B exemplified \n\n with the compound of formula P4, ex as 5-HT\n6\n ligands for treating 5-HT\n6\n receptor- mediated central nervous system diseases and neurodegenerative disorders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n P4, ex \n\n\n WO 02/41889 discloses indole sulfonamide compounds having 5-HT\n6\n affinity with the general formula P5 exemplified with the compound of formula P5, ex as 5- HT li ands for the treatment of CNS disorders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n P5, ex \n\n\n The compounds of the present invention may offer alternatives to current marketed treatments for neurodegenerative and/or psychiatric disorders, which are not efficacious in all patients.

The treatment of these disorders and conditions can be facilitated by administration of an agent which prevents the dysfunction or death of neurons at risk in these disorders or conditions and/or enhances the function of damaged or healthy neurons in such a way as to compensate for the loss of function caused by the dysfunction or death of at-risk neurons. \n\n\n In the present context, the term \"therapeutically effective amount\" of a compound means an amount sufficient to cure, alleviate or partially arrest the clinical manifestations of a given disease and its complications in a therapeutic intervention comprising the administration of said compound. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as \"therapeutically effective amount\". Effective amounts for each purpose will depend on the severity of the disease or injury as well as the weight and general state of the subject. It will be understood that determining an appropriate dosage may be achieved using routine experimentation, by constructing a matrix of values and testing different points in the matrix, which is all within the ordinary skills of a trained physician. \n\n\n In the present context, the term \"treatment\" and \"treating\" means the management and care of a patient for the purpose of combating a condition, such as a disease or a disorder. The term is intended to include the full spectrum of treatments for a given condition from which the patient is suffering, such as administration of the active compound to alleviate the symptoms or complications, to delay the progression of the disease, disorder or condition, to alleviate or relief the symptoms and complications, and/or to cure or eliminate the disease, disorder or condition as well as to prevent the condition, wherein prevention is to be understood as the management and care of a patient for the purpose of combating the disease, condition, or disorder and includes the administration of the active compounds to prevent the onset of the symptoms or complications. Nonetheless, prophylactic (preventive) and therapeutic (curative) treatments are two separate aspects of the invention. The patient to be treated is preferably a mammal, in particular a human being. \n\n Detailed Description of the Invention \n\n\n The inventors have interestingly and surprisingly found that compounds of the present invention generally have a low intrinsic clearance, which leads to good metabolic stability. Furthermore, compounds of the present invention have a low propensity for side effects related to drug-drug interactions since they are only weak inhibitors of the five most abundant human cytochrome P450 enzymes. \n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are defined by formula I or formula II below: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I II \n\n\nwherein R1-R5 is independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, cyano, nitro, -NH\n2\n, -CONH2, hydroxy, Ci-salkyl, C2-8alkenyl, C2-6alkynyl, Ci-6alkoxy or Ci- \n6\nalkylsulfanyl wherein said Ci-salkyl, C2-8alkenyl or C2-6alkynyl is optionally \n\n\nsubstituted with one or more substituents selected from halogen, hydroxy, thiol, -NH\n2\n, -CONH2 or =O and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention are defined by formula I, wherein R1-R5 is independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, cyano, nitro, -NH\n2\n, -CONH2, hydroxy, Ci-salkyl, C2-8alkenyl, C2-6alkynyl, Ci-6alkoxy or Ci- \n6\nalkylsulfanyl wherein said Ci-salkyl, C^-salkenyl or C2-6alkynyl is optionally \n\n\nsubstituted with one or more substituents selected from halogen, hydroxy, thiol, -NH\n2\n, -CONH2 or =O and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. \n\n In one embodiment R1-R5 is independently selected from hydrogen, halogen, Ci-\n6\nalkoxy or Ci-salkyl. \n\n\n In one embodiment at least one of Ri , R2, R3, R\n4\n and R\n5\n is Ci-6alkoxy, such as methoxy. \n\n\n In one embodiment at least one of Ri , R2, R3, R\n4\n and R\n5\n is halogen, such as chlorine or fluorine. \n\n\n In one embodiment at least one of Ri , R2, R3, R\n4\n and R\n5\n is Ci-salkyl, such as methyl. \n\n\n In one embodiment only one of Ri , R2, R\n4\n and R\n5\n is not hydrogen and R3 is hydrogen. \n\n\n In one embodiment Ri , R\n2\n, R3, R\n4\n and R\n5\n are all hydrogen. \n\n\n In a specific embodiment, R\n2\n is methyl.

The BHK cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in culture medium [Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 pg/ml) and 10 % FetaClonel serum]. The cells were split into 14 cm tissue culture dishes and the following day transfected with h5-HT\n6\n-pCR4-TOPO (Guthrie HTR0600000- 01 ) using Lipofectamine 2000\n®\n (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as a DNA carrier according to the manufacturer's protocol. 4-6 h later the culture medium was changed. Cells were grown to 90-95% confluence, and harvested using a cell scraper. \n\n\n [\n3\nH]LSD Binding. Competition binding to membranes of BHK-h5-HT\n6\n cells transiently expressing the human 5-HT\n6\n receptor using [\n3\nH]LSD ([/V-methyl- \n3\nH]Lysergic acid deithylamide, 81 .0 Ci/mmol, GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) was performed. Cells were harvested and scraped into d-PBS, homogenized using an UltraTurrax for 20 sec, centrifuged 40 min @ 40000 x g and frozen. Cell pellets were resuspended in fresh assay buffer (50 mM TRIS pH = 7,7), and the cell membranes were incubated with 1 ,0 nM [\n3\nH]LSD in the presence of various concentrations of compounds in total assay volumes of 200 μΙ. Nonspecific binding was determined in reactions with 10 μΜ Lu25103. The reactions were incubated for 60 min @ RT. Whatman GF/B filters were presoaked for 30 min in a 0.5% \n\n\npolyethyleneimine solution, and binding was terminated by filtration through these filters using a 96-well cell harvester and washing with 2 x 0,5 ml ice-cold TRIS 7,7. Following this, the filters were dried, 50 μΙ OptiPhase SuperMix™ (Perkin Elmer) was added, and the amount of bound radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter (Wallac MicroBeta 1450). The fraction of specifically bound radioligand was always <5% of the total amount of radioligand. Determination of 5-HT6 Compound Intrinsic Activity using cAMP Accumulation. \n\n\n Intracellular cAMP levels were measured using 24-well plates containing the human 5-HT\n6\n receptor stabily transfected into HELA cells. Upon initiation of the assay, the media from the cell maintenance was aspirated and the cells were \n\n preincubated at 37°C for 15 min in KREBS buffer. Following this primary incubation, the buffer was aspirated and an additional incubation was performed at 37°C for 5 min in KREBS buffer containing 500 μΜ IBMS (3-isobutyl-1 -methylxanthine). \n\n\nSubsequently, the cells were incubated with the test compound at concentrations ranging from 10-5 to 10-10 M for 10 min at 37°C (antagonist assay required a second incubation with the addition of 100 nM 5-HT). The assay was terminated by the addition of 0.5 M percloric acid. Intracellular cAMP levels were determined by radioimmunoassay through the cAMP SPA screening kit. Data were analyzed graphically with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). \n\n\nMicrosomal stability assay \n\n\n The metabolic stability has been determined by incubation of the test compound at 1 μΜ with human and rat microsomes (BD Biosciences) for 60 min, using NADPH as co-factor. An NADPH regenerating system containing NADP+, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate, sodium citrate and MgC (co-factor mix) was used as a source of NADPH. The microsomes were stored in -80°C, and test tubes with prepared co-factor mix were stored in the freezer until use. The incubation was performed using a liquid handling robot (LHR, Tecan) and the analysis using liquid-chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS, Waters QuattroMicro, Manchester, UK) \n\n\n 2 μΙ_ of the test compound (1 μΜ) was added to 16 wells of a 96 well plate containing 200 μΙ_ co-factor mix and mixed. Human and rat microsomes were thawed in room temperature, added (275 μΙ_) to two tubes containing co-factor mix, vortex mixed and put in a water bath at 37°C for ten minutes. The LHR was prepared and the reaction was initiated by mixing 10 μί of the test compound solution with 90 μί of the microsomes in the presence of co-factor (final \n\n\nconcentration 1 μΜ and 1 mg protein/mL). It was incubated for 60 minutes, and the reactions were stopped by dispensing 100 μΙ_ acetonitrile containing internal standard to the test compound incubations, where it was mixed and transferred to a 96 well stop plate with seals. Samples were taken at 0, 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes. The stop plates were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3300 rpm and 4°C, before being transferred to the LC-MS/MS for analysis. \n\n Cytochrome P450 inhibition assay \n\n\n Cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition was performed using recombinant enzymes (Supersomes™, Gentest) expressing individual CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6). The inhibitions by the test items were assessed by incubating each enzyme with its substrate alone or in presence of the test items at 8 different concentrations (40μΜ-0.02μΜ). \n\n\n The substrate 7-ethoxy-3-cyanocoumarin was used for CYP1A2 (10μΜ) and CYP2C19 (50 μΜ). For CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6, dibenzylfuorescein (2 μΜ), resorufin benzyl ether (100 μΜ) and 3-[2-(N,N-diethyl-N-methylamino)ethyl]-7- methoxy-4-methylcoumarin (3 μΜ) were used, respectively. \n\n\n All incubations (28 min for CYP1A2, 30 min for CYP3A4, and 45 min for CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6) were performed in phosphate buffer with glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase used as co-factor. \n\n\n At the end of the incubation period, the amount of metabolite formed was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer. The excitation and emission wavelengths in nanometers are 450 (Ex) and 465 (Em) for CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6; 485 (Ex) and 535 (Em) for CYP2C9, 530 (Ex) and 590 (Em) for CYP3A4. Inhibitions were expressed relative to controls (without inhibitors) and IC50 were calculated using Excel (Microsoft\n®\n) software."
