Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to methods of treatment of certain metabolic diseases and the use of compounds and their prodrugs, and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds useful in treating such diseases. In particular, the invention relates to the use of compounds and compositions for the prophylaxis, management or treatment of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, and obesity through the inhibition of malonyl-coenzyme A decarboxylase (malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, MCD).\n\n\n \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMalonyl-CoA is an important metabolic intermediary produced by the enzyme Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC) in the body. In the liver, adipocytes, and other tissues, malonyl-CoA is a substrate for fatty acid synthase (FAS). ACC and malonyl-CoA are found in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle tissue, where fatty acid synthase levels are low. The enzyme malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD, EC 4.1.1.9) catalyzes the conversion of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and thereby regulates malonyl-CoA levels. MCD activity has been described in a wide array of organisms, including prokaryotes, birds, and mammals. It has been purified from the bacteria \nRhizobium trifolii\n (\nAn et al., J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 32:414-418(1999\n)), the uropygial glands of waterfowl (\nBuckner, et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys 177:539(1976\n); \nKim and Kolattukudy Arch. Biochem. Biophys 190:585(1978\n)), rat liver mitochondria (\nKim and Kolattukudy, Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 190:234(1978\n)), rat mammary glands (\nKim and Kolattukudy, Biochim. Biophys, Acta 531:187(1978\n)), rat pancreatic β-cell (\nVoilley et al., Biochem. J. 340:213 (1999\n)) and goose (\nAnser anser\n) (\nJang et al., J. Biol. Chem. 264:3500 (1989\n)). Identification of patients with MCD deficiency lead to the cloning of a human gene homologous to goose and rat MCD genes (\nGao et al., J. Lipid. Res. 40:178 (1999\n); \nSacksteder et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274:24461(1999\n); \nFitzPatrick et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet. 65:318(1999\n)). A single human MCD mRNA is observed by Northern Blot analysis. The highest mRNA expression levels are found in muscle and heart tissues, followed by liver, kidney and pancreas, with detectable amounts in all other tissues examined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMalonyl-CoA is a potent endogenous inhibitor of carnitine paimitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I), an enzyme essential for the metabolism of long-chain fatty acids. CPT-I is the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid oxidation and catalyzes the formation of acyl-carnitine, which is transported from the cytosol across the mitochondrial membranes by acyl carnitine translocase. Inside of the mitochondria the long-chain fatty acids are transferred back to CoA form by a complementary enzyme, CPT-II, and, in the mitochondria, acyl-CoA enters the β-oxidation pathway generating acetyl-CoA. In the liver, high levels of acetyl-CoA occurs for example following a meal, leading to elevated malonyl-CoA levels, which inhibit CPT-I, thereby preventing fat metabolism and favoring fat synthesis. Conversely, low malonyl-CoA levels favor fatty acid metabolism by allowing the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria. Hence, malonyl-CoA is a central metabolite that plays a key role in balancing fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation (\nZammit, Biochem. J. 343:5050-515(1999\n)). Recent work indicates that MCD is able to regulate cytoplasmic as well as mitochondrial malonyl-CoA levels [\nAlam and Saggerson, Biochem J. 334:233-241(1998\n); \nDyck et al., Am J Physiology 275:H2122-2129(1998\n)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough malonyl-CoA is present in muscle and cardiac tissues, only low levels of FAS have been detected in these tissues. It is believed that the role of malonyl-CoA and MCD in these tissues is to regulate fatty acid metabolism. This is achieved via malonyl-CoA inhibition of muscle (M) and liver (L) isoforms of CPT-I, which are encoded by distinct genes (\nMcGarry and Brown, Eur. J. Biochem. 244:1-14(1997\n)). The muscle isoform is more sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition (IC50 0.03 µM) than the liver isoform (IC\n50\n 2.5 µM). Malonyl-CoA regulation of CPT-I has been described in the liver, heart, skeletal muscle and pancreatic β-cells. In addition, malonyl-CoA sensitive acyl-CoA transferase activity present in microsomes, perhaps part of a system that delivers acyl groups into the endoplasmic reticulum, has also been described (\nFraser et al., FEBS Lett. 446: 69-74 (1999\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCardiovascular Diseases\n: The healthy human heart utilizes available metabolic substrates. When blood glucose levels are high, uptake and metabolism of glucose provide the major source of fuel for the heart. In the fasting state, lipids are provided by adipose tissues, and fatty acid uptake and metabolism in the heart down regulate glucose metabolism. The regulation of intermediary metabolism by serum levels of fatty acid and glucose comprises the glucose-fatty acid cycle (\nRandle et al., Lancet, 1:785-789(1963\n)). Under ischemic conditions, limited oxygen supply reduces both fatty acid and glucose oxidation and reduces the amount of ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation in the cardiac tissues. In the absence of sufficient oxygen, glycolysis increases in an attempt to maintain ATP levels and a buildup of lactate and a drop in intracellular pH results. Energy is spent maintaining ion homeostasis, and myocyte cell death occurs as a result of abnormally low ATP levels and disrupted cellular osmolarity. Additionally, AMPK, activated during ischemia, phosphorylates and thus inactivates ACC. Total cardiac malonyl-CoA levels drop, CPT-I activity therefore is increased and fatty acid oxidation is favored over glucose oxidation. The beneficial effects of metabolic modulators in cardiac tissue are the increased efficiency of ATP/mole oxygen for glucose as compared to fatty acids and more importantly the increased coupling of glycolysis to glucose oxidation resulting in the net reduction of the proton burden in the ischemic tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of clinical and experimental studies indicate that shifting energy metabolism in the heart towards glucose oxidation is an effective approach to decreasing the symptoms associated with cardiovascular diseases, such as but not limited, to myocardial ischemia (\nHearse, \"\nMetabolic approaches to ischemic heart disease and its management\n\", Science Press\n). Several clinically proven anti-angina drugs including perhexiline and amiodarone inhibit fatty acid oxidation via inhibition of CPT-I (\nKennedy et al., Biochem. Pharmacology, 52: 273 (1996\n)). The antianginal drugs ranolazine, currently in Phase III clinical trials, and trimetazidine are shown to inhibit fatty acid β-oxidation (\nMcCormack et al., Genet. Pharmac. 30:639(1998\n), \nPepine et al., Am. J. Cardiology 84:46 (1999\n)). Trimetazidine has been shown to specifically inhibit the long-chain 3-ketoactyl CoA thiolase, an essential step in fatty acid oxidation. (\nKantor et al., Circ. Res. 86:580-588 (2000\n)). Dichloroacetate increases glucose oxidation by stimulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and improves cardiac function in those patients with coronary artery diseases (\nWargovich et al., Am. J. Cardiol. 61:65-70 (1996\n)). Inhibiting CPT-I activity through the increased malonyl-CoA levels with MCD inhibitors would result in not only a novel, but also a much safer method, as compared to other known small molecule CPT-I inhibitors, to the prophylaxis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMost of the steps involved in glycerol-lipid synthesis occur on the cytosolic side of liver endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The synthesis of triacyl glycerol (TAG) targeted for secretion inside the ER from diacyl gycerol (DAG) and acyl CoA is dependent upon acyl CoA transport across the ER membrane. This transport is dependent upon a malonyl-CoA sensitive acyl-CoA transferase activity (\nZammit, Biochem. J. 343: 505(1999\n) \nAbo-Hashema, Biochem. 38: 15840 (1999\n) and \nAbo-Hashema, J. Biol. Chem. 274:35577 (1999\n)). Inhibition of TAG biosynthesis by a MCD inhibitor may improve the blood lipid profile and therefore reduce the risk factor for coronary artery disease of patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nDiabetes:\n Two metabolic complications most commonly associated with diabetes are hepatic overproduction of ketone bodies (in NIDDM) and organ toxicity associated with sustained elevated levels of glucose. Inhibition of fatty acid oxidation can regulate blood-glucose levels and ameliorate some symptoms of type II diabetes. Malonyl-CoA inhibition of CPT-I is the most important regulatory mechanism that controls the rate of fatty acid oxidation during the onset of the hypoinsulinemic-hyperglucagonemic state. Several irreversible and reversible CPT-I inhibitors have been evaluated for their ability to control blood glucose levels and they are all invariably hypoglycemic (\nAnderson, Current Pharmaceutical Design 4:1 (1998\n)). A liver specific and reversible CPT-inhibitor, SDZ-CPI-975, significantly lowers glucose levels in normal 18-hour-fasted nonhuman primates and rats without inducing cardiac hypertrophy (\nDeems et al., Am. J. Physiology 274:R524 (1998\n)). Malonyl-CoA plays a significant role as a sensor of the relative availability of glucose and fatty acid in pancreatic β-cells, and thus links glucose metabolism to cellular energy status and insulin secretion. It has been shown that insulin secretagogues elevate malonyl-CoA concentration in β-cells (\nPrentki et al., Diabetes 45: 273 (1996\n)). Treating diabetes directly with CPT-I inhibitors has, however, resulted in mechanism-based hepatic and myocardial toxicities. MCD inhibitors that inhibit CPT-I through the increase of its endogenous inhibitor, malonyl-CoA, are thus safer and superior as compared to CPT-I inhibitors for treatment of diabetic diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nCancers:\n Malonyl-CoA has been suggested to be a potential mediator of cytotoxicity induced by fatty-acid synthase inhibition in human breast cancer cells and xenografts (\nPizer et al., Cancer Res. 60:213 (2000\n)). It is found that inhibition of fatty acid synthase using antitumor antibiotic cerulenin or a synthetic analog C75 markedly increase the malonyl-CoA levels in breast carcinoma cells.\n\nOn the other hand, the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor, TOFA (5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid), which only inhibits at the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) level, does not show any antitumor activity, while at the same time the malonyl-CoA level is decreased to 60% of the control. It is believed that the increased malonyl-CoA level is responsible for the antitumor activity of these fatty acid synthase inhibitors. Regulating malonyl-CoA levels using MCD inhibitors thus constitutes a valuable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nObesity:\n It is suggested that malonyl-CoA may play a key role in appetite signaling in the brain \nvia\n the inhibition of the neuropepetide Y pathway (\nLoftus et al., Science 288: 2379(2000\n)). Systemic or intracerebroventricular treatment of mice with fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitor cerulenin or C75 led to inhibition of feeding and dramatic weight loss. It is found that C75 inhibited expression of the prophagic signal neuropeptide Y in the hypothalamus and acted in a leptin-independent manner that appears to be mediated by malonyl-CoA. Therefore control of malonyl-CoA levels through inhibition of MCD provides a novel approach to the prophylaxis and treatment of obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe have now found a novel use for compounds containing thiazoles and oxazoles, members of which are potent inhibitors of MCD. The compounds tested both \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n inhibit malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activities and increase the malonyl-CoA concentration in the animal tissues. In addition, by way of example, selected compounds induce a significant increase in glucose oxidation as compared with the control in an isolated perfused rat heart assay (\nMcNeill, Measurement of Cardiovascular Function, CRC Press, 1997\n). Advantageously, preferred compounds embodied in this application have more profound effects in metabolism shift than the known metabolism modulators such as ranolazine or trimetazidine. The compounds useful for this invention and pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds are therefore useful in medicine, especially in the prophylaxis, management and treatment of various cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers and obesity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, these compounds are also useful as a diagnostic tool for diseases associated with MCD deficiency or malfunctions.\n\n\n \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods for the use of compounds as depicted by structure I, pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, and methods for the prophylaxis, management and treatment of metabolic diseases and diseases modulated by MCD inhibition.

The specific \"safe and therapeutically effective amount\" will, obviously, vary with such factors as the particular condition being treated, the physical condition of the patient, the duration of treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy (if any), the specific dosage form to be used, the carrier employed, the solubility of the compound therein, and the dosage regimen desired for the composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the selected compound useful for the present invention, the compositions of the present invention contain a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. The term \"pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier\", as used herein, means one or more compatible solid or liquid filler diluents or encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration to a mammal. The term \"compatible\", as used herein, means that the components of the composition are capable of being commingled with the subject compound, and with each other, in a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially reduce the pharmaceutical efficacy of the composition under ordinary use situations. Pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers must, of course, be of sufficiently high purity and sufficiently low toxicity to render them suitable for administration preferably to an animal, preferably mammal being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome examples of substances, which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers or components thereof, are sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, and methyl cellulose; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; solid lubricants, such as stearic acid and magnesium stearate; calcium sulfate; vegetable oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and oil of theobroma; polyols such as propylene glycol, glycerine, sorbitol, mannitol, and polyethylene glycol; alginic acid; emulsifiers, such as the TWEENS; wetting agents, such sodium lauryl sulfate; coloring agents; flavoring agents; tableting agents, stabilizers; antioxidants; preservatives; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; and phosphate buffer solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe choice of a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier to be used in conjunction with the subject compound is basically determined by the way the compound is to be administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the subject compound is to be injected, the preferred pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier is sterile, physiological saline, with blood-compatible suspending agent, the pH of which has been adjusted to about 7.4. In particular, pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers for systemic administration include sugars, starches, cellulose and its derivatives, malt, gelatin, talc, calcium sulfate, vegetable oils, synthetic oils, polyols, alginic acid, phosphate buffer solutions, emulsifiers, isotonic saline, and pyrogen-free water. Preferred carriers for parenteral administration include propylene glycol, ethyl oleate, pyrrolidone, ethanol, and sesame oil. Preferably, the pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, in compositions for parenteral administration, comprises at least about 90% by weight of the total composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of this invention are preferably provided in unit dosage form. As used herein, a \"unit dosage form\" is a composition of this invention containing an amount of a compound that is suitable for administration to an animal, preferably mammal subject, in a single dose, according to good medical practice. (The preparation of a single or unit dosage form however, does not imply that the dosage form is administered once per day or once per course of therapy. Such dosage forms are contemplated to be administered once, twice, thrice or more per day, and are expected to be given more than once during a course of therapy, though a single administration is not specifically excluded. The skilled artisan will recognize that the formulation does not specifically contemplate the entire course of therapy and such decisions are left for those skilled in the art of treatment rather than formulation.) These compositions preferably contain from about 5 mg (milligrams), more preferably from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg, more preferably to about 500 mg, most preferably to about 300 mg, of the selected compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions useful for this invention may be in any of a variety of forms, suitable (for example) for oral, nasal, rectal, topical (including transdermal), ocular, intracereberally, intravenous, intramuscular, or parenteral administration. (The skilled artisan will appreciate that oral and nasal compositions comprise compositions that are administered by inhalation, and made using available methodologies.) Depending upon the particular route of administration desired, a variety of pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers well-known in the art may be used. These include solid or liquid fillers, diluents, hydrotropies, surface-active agents, and encapsulating substances. Optional pharmaceutically-active materials may be included, which do not substantially interfere with the inhibitory activity of the compound. The amount of carrier employed in conjunction with the compound is sufficient to provide a practical quantity of material for administration per unit dose of the compound. Techniques and compositions for making dosage forms useful in the methods of this invention are described in the following references, all incorporated by reference herein: \nModern Pharmaceutics, Chapters 9 and 10 (Banker & Rhodes, editors, 1979\n); \nLieberman et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets (1981\n); and \nAnsel, Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms 2d Edition (1976\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious oral dosage forms can be used, including such solid forms as tablets, capsules, granules and bulk powders. These oral forms comprise a safe and effective amount, usually at least about 5%, and preferably from about 25% to about 50%, of the compound. Tablets can be compressed, tablet triturates, enteric-coated, sugar-coated, film-coated, or multiple-compressed, containing suitable binders, lubricants, diluents, disintegrating agents, coloring agents, flavoring agents, flow-inducing agents, and melting agents. Liquid oral dosage forms include aqueous solutions, emulsions, suspensions, solutions and/or suspensions reconstituted from non-effervescent granules, and effervescent preparations reconstituted from effervescent granules, containing suitable solvents, preservatives, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, diluents, sweeteners, melting agents, coloring agents and flavoring agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier suitable for the preparation of unit dosage forms for peroral administration are well-known in the art. Tablets typically comprise conventional pharmaceutically-compatible adjuvants as inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, mannitol, lactose and cellulose; binders such as starch, gelatin and sucrose; disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and croscarmelose; lubricants such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid and talc. Glidants such as silicon dioxide can be used to improve flow characteristics of the powder mixture. Coloring agents, such as the FD&C dyes, can be added for appearance. Sweeteners and flavoring agents, such as aspartame, saccharin, menthol, peppermint, and fruit flavors, are useful adjuvants for chewable tablets. Capsules typically comprise one or more solid diluents disclosed above. The selection of carrier components depends on secondary considerations like taste, cost, and shelf stability, which are not critical for the purposes of the subject invention, and can be readily made by a person skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeroral compositions also include liquid solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and the like. The pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers suitable for preparation of such compositions are well known in the art. Typical components of carriers for syrups, elixirs, emulsions and suspensions include ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, liquid sucrose, sorbitol and water. For a suspension, typical suspending agents include methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, AVICEL RC-591, tragacanth and sodium alginate; typical wetting agents include lecithin and polysorbate 80; and typical preservatives include methyl paraben and sodium benzoate. Peroral liquid compositions may also contain one or more components such as sweeteners, flavoring agents and colorants disclosed above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch compositions may also be coated by conventional methods, typically with pH or time-dependent coatings, such that the subject compound is released in the gastrointestinal tract in the vicinity of the desired topical application, or at various times to extend the desired action. Such dosage forms typically include, but are not limited to, one or more of cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate, ethyl cellulose, Eudragit coatings, waxes and shellac.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions of the subject invention may optionally include other drug actives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther compositions useful for attaining systemic delivery of the subject compounds include sublingual, buccal and nasal dosage forms. Such compositions typically comprise one or more of soluble filler substances such as sucrose, sorbitol and mannitol; and binders such as acacia, microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose. Glidants, lubricants, sweeteners, colorants, antioxidants and flavoring agents disclosed above may also be included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions of this invention can also be administered topically to a subject, e.g., by the direct application or spreading of the composition on the epidermal or epithelial tissue of the subject, or transdermally via a \"patch\". Such compositions include, for example, lotions, creams, solutions, gels and solids. These topical compositions preferably comprise a safe and effective amount, usually at least about 0.1 %, and preferably from about 1% to about 5%, of the compound. Suitable carriers for topical administration preferably remain in place on the skin as a continuous film, and resist being removed by perspiration or immersion in water. Generally, the carrier is organic in nature and capable of having dispersed or dissolved therein the compound. The carrier may include pharmaceutically-acceptable emollient, emulsifiers, thickening agents, solvents and the like.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMETHODS OF ADMINISTRATION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds and compositions useful in this invention can be administered topically or systemically. Systemic application includes any method of introducing compound into the tissues of the body, e.g., intra-articular, intrathecal, epidural, intramuscular, transdermal, intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, sublingual administration, inhalation, rectal, or oral administration. The compounds useful in the present invention are preferably administered orally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specific dosage of the compound to be administered, as well as the duration of treatment is to be individualised by the treating clinicians. Typically, for a human adult (weighing approximately 70 kilograms), from about 5 mg, preferably from about 10 mg to about 3000 mg, more preferably to about 1000 mg, more preferably to about 300 mg, of the selected compound is administered per day. It is understood that these dosage ranges are by way of example only, and that daily administration can be adjusted depending on the factors listed above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn all of the foregoing, of course, the compounds useful in the present invention can be administered alone or as mixtures, and the compositions may further include additional drugs or excipients as appropriate for the indication. For example, in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, it is clearly contemplated that the invention may be used in conjunction with beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, angiotensin receptor inhibitors, or known cardiovascular drugs or therapies. Hence, in this example, compounds or compositions useful in this invention are useful when dosed together with another active and can be combined in a single dosage form or composition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese compositions can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, or phosphatidylcholines.\n\n\n \n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"alkyl\" means a straight chain alkane, alkene, or alkyne substituent containing only carbon and hydrogen, such as methyl, ethyl, butyl, pentyl, heptyl and the like. Alkyl groups can be saturated or unsaturated (i.e., containing -C=C- or -C≡C- linkages), at one or several positions. When a specific degree of unsaturation is preferred, said substituent is referred to as either \"alkenyl\" or \"alkynyl\", denoting substituents containing -C=C- or -C=C- linkages, respectively. The number of carbons may be denoted as \"C\ni\n-C\nj\n-alkyl\" wherein I and j refer to the minimum and maximum number of carbon atoms, respectively. Typically, alkyl groups will comprise 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 10, and more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"substituted alkyl\" means a hydrocarbon substituent, which is linear, cyclic or branched, in which one or more hydrogen atoms are substituted by carboxy, hydroxy, alkoxy, cyano, nitro, carbonyl, aryl, carboxyalkyl, mercapto, amino, amido, ureido, carbamoyl, sulfonamido, sulfamido, or halogen. Preferred substituted alkyls have their alkyl spacers (i.e., portion which is alkyl) of 1 to about 5 carbons, and may be branched or linear, and may include cyclic substituents, either as part or all of their structure. Preferred examples of \"substituted alkyls\" include 4-carboxybutyl, pyridin-2-ylmethyl, and 1,3-thiazol-2-ylmethyl, benzyl, phenethyl, and trifluoromethyl. The term \"substituted alkyl\" may be combined with other art accepted terms. For example \"substituted alkoxy\" means alkoxy as understood in the art, wherein the alkyl portion of the substituent is substituted.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"branched alkyl\" means a subset of \"alkyl\", and thus is a hydrocarbon substituent, which is branched. Preferred branched alkyls are of 3 to about 12 carbons, and may include cycloalkyl within their structure. Examples of branched alkyl include isopropyl, isobutyl, 1,2-dimethyl-propyl, cyclopentylmethyl and the like. The term \"branched alkyl\" may be combined with other art accepted terms. For example \"branched alkoxy\" means alkoxy as understood in the art, wherein the alkyl portion of the substituent is branched.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"cycloalkyl\" is a hydrocarbon substituent that is cyclic, and can be substituted or unsubstituted.

Hence \"(alkylene)R\ni\n\" is an alkyl diradical attached at one carbon and having substituent R\ni\n attached at another carbon, which may be one or more carbons away from the point of attachment. Alkylene can be linear, branched, or cyclic. Examples of alkylene include -CH\n2\n-, CH\n2\nCH\n2\n-, -(CH\n2\n)\n4\n-, -(cyclohexyl)-, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"aryl\" is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic, i.e., Hückel 4n + 2 rule applies, radical having a single-ring (e.g., phenyl) or multiple condensed rings (e.g., naphthyl or anthryl), which may contain zero to 4 heteroatoms. Hence the term \"heteroaryl\" is clearly contemplated in the term \"aryl\". Preferred carbocyclic aryl, is phenyl. Preferred monocyclic heterocycles, i.e., heteroaryls, are 5 or 6 membered rings. Preferably, where the term \"aryl\" represents an aromatic heterocycle, it is referred to as \"heteroaryl\" or \"heteroaromatic\", and has one or more heteroatom(s). Preferred numbers of such heteroatoms are from one to three N atoms, and preferably when \"heteroaryl\" is a heterocycle of five members, it has one or two heteroatoms selected from O, N, or S. Hence, preferred heterocycles have up to three, more preferably two or less, heteroatoms present in the aromatic ring. The skilled artisan will recognize that among heteroaryl, there are both five and six membered rings. Examples of \"heteroaryl\" include; thienyl, pyridyl, pyrimidyl, pyridazyl, furyl, oxazolyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, oxadiazilyl, triazinyl, triazolyl, thiadiazolyl, and others, which the skilled artisan will recognize. In this definition it is clearly contemplated that substitution on the aryl ring is within the scope of this invention. Where substitution occurs, the radical is referred to as \"substituted aryl\". Preferably one to three, more preferably one or two, and most preferably one substituent is attached to the aryl ring. Although many substituents will be useful, preferred substituents include those commonly found in aryl compounds, such as alkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, cyano, nitro, halo, haloalkyl, mercapto and the like. Such substituents are prepared using known methodologies. These substituents may be attached at various positions of the aryl ring, and wherein a given placement is preferred, such placement is indicated by \"\no\n,\nm\n,\np\n-R\ni\n-aryl\". Thus, if substituent R\ni\n is attached at the para position of the aryl, then this is indicated as \"\np\n-R\ni\n-substituted aryl\".\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"amide\" includes both RNR'CO- (in the case of R = alkyl, alkaminocarbonyl-) and RCONR'- (in the case of R = alkyl, alkyl carbonylamino- ).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"ester\" includes both ROCO- (in the case of R = alkyl, alkoxycarbonyl-) and RCOO- (in the case of R = alkyl, alkylcarbonyloxy-).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"halogen\" is a chloro, bromo, fluoro or iodo atom radical.

These may be substituted or unsubstituted, and are attached to other parts of the molecule via any available valence, preferably any available carbon or nitrogen. More preferred heterocycles are of 5 or 6 members. In six-membered monocyclic heterocycles, the heteroatom(s) are from one to three of O, S, or N, and wherein when the heterocycle is five-membered, preferably it has one or two heteroatoms selected from O, N, or S.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"heterocyclyl\" means radical heterocycles. These may be substituted or unsubstituted, and are attached to other via any available valence, preferably any available carbon or nitrogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"sulfamido\" means an alkyl-N-S(O)\n2\nN-, aryl-NS(O)\n2\nN- or heterocyclyl-NS(O)\n2\nN- group wherein the alkyl, aryl or heterocyclyl group is as defined herein above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"sulfonamido\" means an alkyl-S(O)\n2\nN-, aryl-S(O)\n2\nN- or heterocyclyl- S(O)\n2\nN- group wherein the alkyl, aryl or heterocyclcyl group is as herein described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"ureido\" means an alkyl-NCON-, aryl-NCON- or heterocyclyl-NCON- group wherein the alkyl, aryl or heterocyclyl group is as herein described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA substituent referred to as a radical in this specification may form a ring with another radical as described herein. When such radicals are combined, the skilled artisan will understand that there are no unsatisfied valences in such a case, but that specific substitutions, for example a bond for a hydrogen, is made. Hence certain radicals can be described as forming rings together. The skilled artisan will recognize that such rings can and are readily formed by routine chemical reactions, and it is within the purview of the skilled artisan to both envision such rings and the methods of their formations. Preferred are rings having from 3-7 members, more preferably 5 or 6 members. Compounds described herein may have cyclic structures therein, such as a ring R\n1\n and R\n2\n. In that regard the skilled artisan recognizes that this method of description is routine in medicinal chemistry, though such may not rigorously reflect the chemical synthetic route. As used herein the term \"ring\" or \"rings\" when formed by the combination of two radicals refers to heterocyclic or carbocyclic radicals, and such radicals may be saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic. For example, preferred heterocyclic ring systems include heterocyclic rings, such as morpholinyl, piperdinyl, imidazolyl, pyrrolidinyl, and pyridyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled artisan will recognize that the radical of formula:\n\n \n \n\nrepresents a number of different functionalities. Preferred functionalities represented by this structure include amides, ureas, thioureas, carbamates, esters, thioesters, amidines, ketones, oximes, nitroolefines, hydroxyguanidines and guanidines. More preferred functionalities include ureas, thioureas, amides, and carbamates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled artisan will recognize that some structures described herein may be resonance forms or tautomers of compounds that may be fairly represented by other chemical structures. The artisan recognizes that such structures are clearly contemplated within the scope of this invention, although such resonance forms or tautomers are not represented herein. For example, the structures:\n\n \n \n\nclearly represent the same compound(s), and reference to either clearly contemplates the other. In addition, the compounds useful in this invention can be provided as prodrugs, the following of which serve as examples:\n\n \n \n\nwherein R is a group (or linkage) removed by biological processes. Hence, clearly contemplated in this invention is the use compounds provided as biohydrolyzable prodrugs, as they are understood in the art. \"Prodrug\", as used herein is any compound wherein when it is exposed to the biological processes in an organism, is hydrolyzed, metabolized, derivatized or the like, to yield an active substance having the desired activity. The skilled artisan will recognize that prodrugs may or may not have any activity as prodrugs. It is the intent that the prodrugs described herein have no deleterious effect on the subject to be treated when dosed in safe and effective amounts. These include for example, biohydrolyzable amides and esters. A \"biohydrolyzable amide\" is an amide compound which does not essentially interfere with the activity of the compound, or that is readily converted \nin vivo\n by a cell, tissue, or human, mammal, or animal subject to yield an active compound. A \"biohydrolyzable ester\" refers to an ester compound that does not interfere with the activity of these compounds or that is readily converted by an animal to yield an active compound. Such biohydrolyzable prodrugs are understood by the skilled artisan and are embodied in regulatory guidelines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds and compositions herein also specifically contemplate pharmaceutically acceptable salts, whether cationic or anionic. A \"pharmaceutically-acceptable salt\" is an anionic salt formed at any acidic (e.g., carboxyl) group, or a cationic salt formed at any basic (e.g., amino) group. Many such salts are known in the art, as described in World Patent Publication \n \n87/05297, Johnston et al., published September 11, 1987\n \n (incorporated by reference herein). Preferred counter-ions of salts formable at acidic groups can include cations of salts, such as the alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium), and alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium) and organic salts. Preferred salts formable at basic sites include anions such as the halides (such as chloride salts). Of course, the skilled artisan is aware that a great number and variation of salts may be used, and examples exist in the literature of either organic or inorganic salts useful in this manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInasmuch as the compounds useful in this invention may contain one or more stereogenic centers, \"Optical isomer\", \"stereoisomer\", \"enantiomer,\" \"diastereomer,\" as referred to herein have the standard art recognized meanings (cf. \nHawleys Condensed Chemical Dictionary\n, 11th Ed.) and are included in these compounds, whether as racemates, or their optical isomers, stereoisomers, enantiomers, and diastereomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"metabolic disease\", means a group of identified disorders in which errors of metabolism, imbalances in metabolism, or sub-optimal metabolism occur. The metabolic diseases as used herein also contemplate a disease that can be treated through the modulation of metabolism, although the disease itself may or may not be caused by specific metabolism blockage. Preferably, such metabolic disease involves glucose and fatty acid oxidation pathway. More preferably, such metabolic disease involves MCD or is modulated by levels of Malonyl CoA, and is referred to herein as an \"MCD or MCA related disorder.\"\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPREPARATION OF COMPOUNDS USEFUL IN THIS INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe starting materials used in preparing the compounds useful in this invention are known, made by known methods, or are commercially available. It will be apparent to the skilled artisan that methods for preparing precursors and functionality related to the compounds claimed herein are generally described in the literature. The skilled artisan given the literature and this disclosure is well equipped to prepare any of these compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is recognized that the skilled artisan in the art of organic chemistry can readily carry out manipulations without further direction, that is, it is well within the scope and practice of the skilled artisan to carry out these manipulations. These include reduction of carbonyl compounds to their corresponding alcohols, reductive alkylation of amines, oxidations, acylations, aromatic substitutions, both electrophilic and nucleophilic, etherifications, esterification, saponification and the like. These manipulations are discussed in standard texts such as \nMarch Advanced Organic Chemistry (Wiley\n), \nCarey and Sundberg, Advanced Organic Chemistry\n and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled artisan will readily appreciate that certain reactions are best carried out when other functionality is masked or protected in the molecule, thus avoiding any undesirable side reactions and/or increasing the yield of the reaction. Often the skilled artisan utilizes protecting groups to accomplish such increased yields or to avoid the undesired reactions. These reactions are found in the literature and are also well within the scope of the skilled artisan. Examples of many of these manipulations can be found for example in \nT. Greene and P. Wuts Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 2nd Ed., John Wiley & Sons (1991\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following example schemes are provided for the guidance of the reader, and represent preferred methods for making the compounds exemplified herein. These methods are not limiting, and it will be apparent that other routes may be employed to prepare these compounds. Such methods specifically include solid phase based chemistries, including combinatorial chemistry. The skilled artisan is thoroughly equipped to prepare these compounds by those methods given the literature and this disclosure.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIn vitro MCD Inhibitory Assay:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe conversion of acetyl-CoA from malonyl-CoA was assayed using a modified protocol as previously described by \nKim, Y. S. and Kolattukudy, P. E. in 1978 (Arch. Biochem. Biophys 190:585 (1978\n)). As shown in eq. 1 - 3, the establishment of the kinetic equilibrium between malate / NAD and oxaloacetate / NADH was catalyzed by malic dehydrogenase (eq. 2). The enzymatic reaction product of MCD, acetyl-CoA, shifted the equilibrium by condensing with oxaloacetate in the presence of citrate synthase (eq. 3), which resulted in a continuous generation of NADH from NAD. The accumulation of NADH can be continuously followed by monitoring the increase of fluorescence emission at 460 nm on a fluorescence plate reader. The fluorescence plate reader was calibrated using the authentic acetyl-CoA from Sigma. For a typical 96-well plate assay, the increase in the fluorescence emission (λ\nex\n = 360 nm, λ\nem\n = 460 nm, for NADH) in each well was used to calculate the initial velocity of hMCD. Each 50 µL assay contained 10 mM phosphate buffered saline (Sigma), pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween-20, 25mM K\n2\nHPO\n4\n - KH\n2\nPO\n4\n (Sigma), 2 mM Malate (Sigma), 2 mM NAD (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.786 units of MD (Roche Chemicals), 0.028 unit of CS (Roche Chemicals), 5 - 10 nM hMCD, and varying amounts of MCA substrate. Assays were initiated by the addition of MCA, and the rates were corrected for the background rate determined in the absence of hMCD.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nIsolated Working Rat Heart Assay Protocol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIsolated working hearts from male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-350 g) are subjected to a 60-minute aerobic perfusion period. The working hearts are perfused with 95% O\n2\n, 5% CO\n2\n with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 5 mM glucose; 100 µU/mL insulin; 3% fatty acid-free BSA; 2.5 mM free Ca\n2+\n, and 0.4 to 1.2 mmol/L palmitate (\nKantor et al., Circulation Research 86:580-588(2000\n)). The test compound is added 5 minutes before the perfusion period. DMSO (0.05%) is used as control.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMeasurement of Glucose Oxidation Rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSamples were taken at 10-minute intervals for measurements of experimental parameters. Glucose oxidation rates are determined by the quantitative collection of \n14\nCO\n2\n produced by hearts perfused with buffer containing [U14]-Glucose (\nR. Barr and G. Lopaschuk, in \"\nMeasurement of cardiovascular function\n\", McNeill, J. H. ed., Chapter 2, CRC press, New York (1997\n)). After the perfusion, the \n14\nCO\n2\n from the perfusae is subsequently released by injecting 1 mL of perfusate into sealed test tube containing 1 mL of 9N H\n2\nSO4. The tube was sealed with a rubber stopper attached to a scintillation vial containing a piece of filter papers saturated with 300 µl of hyamine hydroxide. The scintillation vials with filter papers were then removed and Ecolite Scintillation Fluid added. Samples were counted by standard procedures as described above. Average rates of glucose oxidation for each phase of perfusion are expressed as µmol /min/g dry wt as described above.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMeasurement of Fatty Acid Oxidation Rates:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nRates of fatty acid oxidation are determined using the same method as described above for glucose oxidation rate measurement using [\n14\nC]palmitate or by the quantitative collection of \n3\nH\n2\nO produced by hearts perfused with buffer containing [5-\n3\nH]palmitate (\nR. Barr and G. Lopaschuk, in \"\nMeasurement of cardiovascular function\n\", McNeill, J. H. ed., Chapter 2, CRC press, New York (1997\n)). \n3\nH\n2\nO was separated from [5-\n3\nH]palmitate by treating 0.5 mL buffer samples with 1.88 mL of a mixture of chloroform/methanol (1:2 v:v) and then adding 0.625 mL of chloroform and 0.625 mL of a 2 M KCl/HCl solution. The sample is centrifuged for 10 min and aqueous phase was removed and treated with a mixture of 1 mL of chloroform, 1 mL of methanol and 0.9 mL KCl/HCl with a ration of 1:1:0.9. The aqueous layer was then counted for total \n3\nH\n2\nO determination. This process resulted in greater than 99.7% extraction and separation of \n3\nH\n2\nO from the pamiltate. Average rates of fatty acid oxidation for each phase of perfusion are expressed as nmol/min/g dry wt after taking consideration the dilution factor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActive compounds are characterized by an increase in glucose oxidation and/or decrease in fatty acid oxidation as compared to the control experiments (DMSO). The compounds that caused statistically significant increases in glucose oxidation and/or decrease in fatty acid oxidation are considered to be active. Statistical significance was calculated using the Student's t test for paired or unpaired samples, as appropriate. The results with P < 0.05 are considered to be statistically significant.\n\n\n \n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nTo further illustrate this invention, the following examples are included.\n\nThe examples should not be construed as specifically limiting the invention.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compositions comprising Factor VII and other blood clotting factors having altered patterns of asparagine-linked glycosylation.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe proteins involved in the clotting cascade, including, e.g., Factor VII, Factor VIII, Factor IX, Factor X, and Protein C, are proving to be useful therapeutic agents to treat a variety of pathological conditions. Accordingly, there is an increasing need for formulations comprising these proteins that are pharmaceutically acceptable and exhibit a uniform and predetermined clinical efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of the many disadvantages of using human plasma as a source of pharmaceutical products, it is preferred to produce these proteins in recombinant systems. The clotting proteins, however, are subject to a variety of co- and post-translational modifications, including, e.g., asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycosylation; O-linked glycosylation; and γ-carboxylation of glu residues. These modifications may be qualitatively or quantitatively different when heterologous cells are used as hosts for large-scale production of the proteins. In particular, production in heterologous cells often results in a different array of glycoforms, which are identical polypeptides having different covalently linked oligosaccharide structures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn different systems, variations in the oligosaccharide structure of therapeutic proteins have been linked to, \ninter alia,\n changes in immunogenicity and \nin vivo\n clearance. Thus, there is a need in the art for compositions and methods that provide clotting protein preparations, particularly preparations comprising recombinant human Factor VII, modified Factor VII, or Factor VII-related polypeptides, that contain predetermined glycoform patterns.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to preparations comprising Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides that exhibit predetermined glycoform patterns. As used herein, a Factor VII or Factor VII-related preparation refers to a plurality of Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides, including variants and chemically modified forms, as well as forms that have been proteolytically activated (e.g., Factor VIIa), that have been separated from the cell in which they were synthesized. A glycoform pattern refers to the distribution within the preparation of oligosaccharide chains having varying structures that are covalently linked to Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides a preparation comprising a plurality of Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides, wherein the polypeptides comprise asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains and wherein one or more of the following applies: (i) between about 94-100% of the oligosaccharide chains comprise at least one sialic acid moiety; (ii) between about 0-7% of the oligosaccharide chains have a neutral charge; (iii) less than about 16%, such as, e.g., between about 6-16% of the oligosaccharide chains comprise at least one terminal galactose residue; (iv) less than about 25%, such as, e.g., between about 6-9% of the oligosaccharide chains comprise at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; or (v) less than about 30%, such as, e.g., between about 11-23% of the oligosaccharide chains comprise at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue. In some embodiments, in addition to one or more of (i)-(v): all of the sialic acid residues in the oligosaccharide chains are linked to galactose via an α2->3 linkage; at least some of the sialic acid residues comprise N-glycolyineuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) in addition to N-acetyineuraminic acid (Neu5Ac); and/or the oligosaccharide chains comprise fucose residues linked α1->6 to a core N-acetylglucosamine. In one embodiment, the invention encompasses a preparation comprising wild-type Factor VIIa in which between about 94-100% of the oligosaccharide chains have at least one sialic acid residue and all of the sialic acid residues are linked to galactose via an α2->3 linkage. In another embodiment, the invention encompasses a preparation comprising wild-type Factor VIIa in which between about 94-100% of the oligosaccharide chains have at least one sialic acid residue and at least some of the sialic acid residues are N-glycolylneuraminic acid. In yet another embodiment, the invention encompasses a preparation comprising wild-type Factor VIIa in which between about 94-100% of the oligosaccharide chains have at least one sialic acid residue and at least some of the chains contain N-acetylgalactosamine. The preparations of the present invention thus do not encompass wild-type Factor VII or Factor VIIa that has been isolated from human plasma and has not been modified \nex vivo\n by glycosidase treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a preparation comprising a plurality of Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides, wherein the polypeptides comprise asparagines-linked oligosaccharide chains and wherein at least about 2% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine residue (i.e., an N-acetylglucosamine residue that is linked β1->2,4, or 6 to a Man residue). Preferably, at least about 5% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one such antennary fucose residue; more preferably, at least about 10% or 20%; and most preferably, at least about 40%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparations according to invention may comprise one or more of unmodified wild-type Factor VII; wild-type Factor VII that has been subjected to chemical and/or enzymatic modification; and Factor VII variants having one or more alterations in amino acid sequence relative to wild-type Factor VII. The preparations of the invention may be derived from human cells expressing Factor VII from an endogenous Factor VII gene or from cells programmed to express Factor VII or a Factor VII-related polypeptide from a recombinant gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides preparations comprising Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides that exhibit one or more improved functional properties, including, without limitation, increased storage stability, bioavailability, and/or half-life.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention encompasses methods for determining and/or optimizing the glycoform pattern of Factor VII and Factor VII-related polypeptides, which are carried out by the steps of:\n\n \n \n \n(a) culturing a cell expressing Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides under a first set of predetermined culture conditions;\n \n(b) recovering Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides from the culture to obtain a preparation comprising the polypeptides; and\n \n(c) analyzing the structure of the oligosaccharides linked to the polypeptides to determine the glycoform pattern of the preparation.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe methods may further comprise altering the culture conditions of step (a) to achieve a second set of predetermined culture conditions; and repeating the steps until a desired glycoform pattern is achieved. Alternatively, the methods may further comprise treating the preparation chemically or enzymatically to alter the oligosaccharide structure; and repeating the steps until a desired glycoform pattern is achieved. Furthermore, the methods may comprise the additional steps of subjecting preparations having predetermined glycoform patterns to at least one test of bioactivity or other functionality (such as, e.g., pharmacokinetic profile or stability), and correlating particular glycoform patterns with particular bioactivity or functionality profiles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods for producing a preparation comprising Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides having a predetermined pattern of N-linked glycosylation. In some embodiments, the methods are carried out by culturing a cell expressing the polypeptides under conditions in which at least about 94% of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides linked to the Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides comprise at least one sialic acid residue, e.g., one, two, three, or four sialic acid residues. In some embodiments, the methods are carried out by culturing a cell expressing the polypeptides under conditions in which at least about 5% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine residue. In some embodiments, Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides, irrespective of their source, are subjected to enzymatic treatments to achieve the desired glycoform patterns.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising the preparations of the invention and methods of preventing and/or treating syndromes that are responsive to Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides. The methods comprise administering the pharmaceutical formulations to a patient in need of treatment, under conditions that result in either an enhancement or inhibition in blood clotting. In one series of embodiments, Factor VII preparations are administered when it is desired to enhance blood clotting, such as, e.g., in haemophilia A, haemophilia B, Factor XI deficiency, Factor VII deficiency, thrombocytopenia, or von Willebrand's disease; in syndromes accompanied by the presence of a clotting factor inhibitor; before, during, or after surgery or anticoagulant therapy; or after trauma. In another series of embodiments, preparations of Factor VII-related polypeptides (i.e., preparations having reduced or modified bioactivity relative to wild-type Factor VII) are administered to reduce blood clotting, such as, e.g., in patients undergoing angioplasty or those suffering from deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), fibrin deposition in lungs and kidneys associated with gram-negative endotoxemia, or myocardial infarction. According to the invention, preparations of Factor VII-related polypeptides may also be administered when it is desired to modify, such as, e.g., reduce, intracellular signalling via a tissue factor (TF)-mediated pathway, to treat conditions such as, e.g., Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), Multiple Organ Failure (MOF), and thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP).\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDetailed Description of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present inventors have discovered that preparations of coagulation proteins having predetermined glycoform patterns exhibit improved functional properties. Accordingly, the present invention relates to methods and compositions that provide these protein preparations. In particular, the invention relates to preparations comprising Factor VII polypeptides and Factor VII-related polypeptides having specific predetermined patterns of asparagine-linked (N-linked) oligosaccharides. The preparations of the invention exhibit altered properties, including, without limitation, improved pharmacokinetic properties and improved clinical efficacy. The invention also encompasses pharmaceutical formulations that comprise these preparations, as well as therapeutic methods that utilize the formulations.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFactor VII Polypeptides and Factor VII-Related Polypeptides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses human Factor VII polypeptides, such as, e.g., those having the amino acid sequence disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,784,950\n \n (wild-type Factor VII). As used herein, \"Factor VII\" or \"Factor VII polypeptide\" encompasses wild-type Factor VII, as well as variants of Factor VII exhibiting substantially the same or improved biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VII. The term \"Factor VII\" is intended to encompass Factor VII polypeptides in their uncleaved (zymogen) form, as well as those that have been proteolytically processed to yield their respective bioactive forms, which may be designated Factor VIIa. Typically, Factor VII is cleaved between residues 152 and 153 to yield Factor VIIa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"Factor VII-related polypeptides\" encompasses polypeptides, including variants, in which the Factor VIIa biological activity has been substantially modified or reduced relative to the activity of wild-type Factor VIIa. These polypeptides include, without limitation, Factor VII or Factor VIIa that has been chemically modified and Factor VII variants into which specific amino acid sequence alterations have been introduced that modify or disrupt the bioactivity of the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biological activity of Factor VIIa in blood clotting derives from its ability to (i) bind to tissue factor (TF) and (ii) catalyze the proteolytic cleavage of Factor IX or Factor X to produce activated Factor IX or X (Factor IXa or Xa, respectively). For purposes of the invention, Factor VIIa biological activity may be quantified by measuring the ability of a preparation to promote blood clotting using Factor VII-deficient plasma and thromboplastin, as described, e.g., in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,997,864\n \n. In this assay, biological activity is expressed as the reduction in clotting time relative to a control sample and is converted to \"Factor VII units\" by comparison with a pooled human serum standard containing 1 unit/ml Factor VII activity. Alternatively, Factor VIIa biological activity may be quantified by (i) measuring the ability of Factor VIIa to produce of Factor Xa in a system comprising TF embedded in a lipid membrane and Factor X. (\nPersson et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272:19919-19924, 1997\n); (ii) measuring Factor X hydrolysis in an aqueous system (see, Example 5 below); (iii) measuring its physical binding to TF using an instrument based on surface plasmon resonance (\nPersson, FEBS Letts. 413:359-363, 1997\n) (iv) measuring hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate (see, Example 4 below); and (v) measuring generation of thrombin in a TF-independent in vitro system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor VII variants having substantially the same or improved biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VIIa encompass those that exhibit at least about 25%, preferably at least about 50%, more preferably at least about 75% and most preferably at least about 90% of the specific activity of wild-type Factor VIIa that has been produced in the same cell type, when tested in one or more of a clotting assay, proteolysis assay, or TF binding assay as described above. Factor VII variants having substantially reduced biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VIIa are those that exhibit less than about 25%, preferably less than about 10%, more preferably less than about 5% and most preferably less than about 1% of the specific activity of wild-type Factor VIIa that has been produced in the same cell type when tested in one or more of a clotting assay, proteolysis assay, or TF binding assay as described above. Factor VII variants having a substantially modified biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VII include, without limitation, Factor VII variants that exhibit TF-independent Factor X proteolytic activity and those that bind TF but do not cleave Factor X.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVariants of Factor VII, whether exhibiting substantially the same or better bioactivity than wild-type Factor VII, or, alternatively, exhibiting substantially modified or reduced bioactivity relative to wild-type Factor VII, include, without limitation, polypeptides having an amino acid sequence that differs from the sequence of wild-type Factor VII by insertion, deletion, or substitution of one or more amino acids. Non-limiting examples of Factor VII variants having substantially the same biological activity as wild-type Factor VII include S52A-FVIIa, S60A-FVIIa (\nlino et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 352: 182-192, 1998\n); FVlla variants exhibiting increased proteolytic stability as disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,580,560\n \n; Factor VIIa that has been proteolytically cleaved between residues 290 and 291 or between residues 315 and 316 (\nMollerup et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 48:501-505, 1995\n); and oxidized forms of Factor VIIa (\nKornfelt et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 363:43-54, 1999\n). Non-limiting examples of Factor VII variants having substantially reduced or modified biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VII include R152E-FVIIa (\nWildgoose et al., Biochem 29:3413-3420, 1990\n), S344A-FVIIa (\nKazama et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:66-72, 1995\n), FFR-FVIIa (\nHolst et al., Eur. J. Vasc. Endovasc. Surg. 15:515-520, 1998\n), and Factor VIIa lacking the Gla domain, (\nNicolaisen et al., FEBS Letts. 317:245-249, 1993\n). Non-limiting examples of chemically modified Factor VII polypeptides and sequence variants are described, e.g., in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5, 997, 864\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAsparagine-Linked Glycosylation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides preparations of Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides that comprise a particular spectrum of Factor VII glycoforms, i.e., Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides having predetermined patterns of asparagine-linked (N-linked) oligosaccharide chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a \"pattern\" of N-linked glycosylation or a glycoform \"pattern\", \"distribution\", or \"spectrum\" refers to the representation of particular oligosaccharide structures within a given population of Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides. Non-limiting examples of such patterns include the relative proportion of oligosaccharide chains that (i) have at least one sialic acid residue; (ii) lack any sialic acid residues (i.e., are neutral in charge); (iii) have at least one terminal galactose residue; (iv) have at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; (v) have at least one \"uncapped\" antenna, i.e., have at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue; or (vi) have at least one fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an oligosaccharide chain refers to the entire oligosaccharide structure that is covalently linked to a single asparagine residue. Factor VII is normally glycosylated at Asn 145 and Asn 322. An N-linked oligosaccharide chain present on Factor VII produced in a human \nin situ\n may be bi-, tri, or tetraantennary, with each antenna having the structure Neu5Ac(α2->3 or α2->6)Gal(β1->4) GlcNAc linked (β1->2,4, or 6) to a Man residue which is linked (α1->3 or 6) to Man(β1->4)GlcNAc(β1->4)GlcNAc-Asn. (Neu5Ac signifies N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid), Gal signifies galactose, GlcNAc signifies N-acetylglucosamine, and Man signifies mannose). The oligosaccharide chains may also comprise fucose residues, which may be linked α 1->6 to GlcNAc. When Factor VII is produced in a human \nin situ,\n some of the oligosaccharide chains lack core fucose residues; all of the chains lack antennary fucose residues; and all of the chains are almost completely sialylated, i.e., the terminal sugar of each antenna is N-acetylneuraminic acid linked to galactose via an α2->3 or α2->6 linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen produced in other circumstances, however, Factor VII may contain oligosaccharide chains having different terminal structures on one or more of their antennae, such as, e.g., lacking sialic acid residues; containing N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) residues; containing a terminal N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue in place of galactose; and the like. When produced in, e.g., BHK cells cultured in the presence of calf serum, Factor VII preparations exhibit the following oligosaccharide patterns:\n\n \n \n \n-87-93% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least a single sialic acid residue;\n \n-7-13% are neutral (lack any sialic acid);\n \n-9-16% contain at least one terminal galactose residue;\n \n-19-29% contain at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; and\n \n-30-39% contain at least one uncapped antenna, i.e., contain at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe present inventors have produced Factor VII preparations containing specific predetermined oligosaccharide patterns that differ from those previously described. The present invention encompasses preparations comprising Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides exhibiting one or more of the following glycoform patterns:\n\n \n \n \n(i) Between about 94-100% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue, such as, e.g., between about 94-99%, between about 95-98%, or between about 96-97%. In different embodiments, at least about 94%, 95%, 96%, or 97% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue.\n \n(ii) 6% or less of the oligosaccharide chains are neutral, such as, e.g., between about 1.5-6% or between about 2-4%.\n \n(iii) Less than about 16%, preferably, less than about 10% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one terminal galactose, such as, e.g., between about 6-10% or between about 8-9%;\n \n(iv) Less than about 25%, preferably, less than about 10% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one terminal GalNAc residue, such as, e.g., between about 6-9% or between about 7-8%;\n \n(v) Less than about 30, preferably, less than about 25% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one uncapped antenna, such as, e.g., between about 11-23% or between about 12-18%; and\n \n(vi) At least about 2%, preferably, at least about 5%, more preferably, at least about 10% or 20%; and most preferably, at least about 40%, of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine residue (i.e., an N-acetylglucosamine residue that is linked β1->2,4, or 6 to a Man residue).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIt will be understood that each of (i)-(vi) may represent a distinct glycoform pattern that is encompassed by the present invention, i.e., a preparation according to the invention may be described by only one of (i)-(vi). Alternatively, depending on the particular glycoform pattern, a preparation encompassed by the invention may be described by more than one of (i)-(vi).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, a preparation encompassed by the invention may be described by one or more of (i)-(vi) in combination with one or more other structural features. For example, the invention encompasses preparations comprising Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides in which the sialic acid residues (Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc) are linked to galactose exclusively in an α2->3 configuration. The invention also encompasses preparations comprising Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides that contain fucose linked α 1->6 to a core N-acetylglucosamine and/or fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine. In one series of embodiments, the preparations of the invention encompass Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides in which more than 99% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue and (a) the sialic acid residues are linked exclusively in an α2->3 configuration and/or (b) there are fucose residues linked to core N-acetylglucosamines and/or (c) a detectable number of antenna terminate in N-acetylgalactosamine. In one embodiment, the invention encompasses preparations comprising wild-type Factor VIIa in which more than 99% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue and the sialic acid residues are linked to galactose exclusively in an α2->3 configuration. In another embodiment, the invention encompasses preparations comprising wild-type Factor VIIa in which more than 99% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue and at least some of the oligosaccharide chains comprise N-acetylgalactosamine. The present invention does not encompass wild-type Factor VII or wild-type Factor VIIa that is isolated from human plasma and is not modified \nex vivo\n by treatment with glycosidases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the Factor VIIa preparation comprises oligosaccharide chains having a single fucose linked α1->3 to one antennary N-acetylglucosamine. In another embodiment, the Factor VIIa preparation comprises oligosaccharide chains having fucose residues linked α1->3 to each antennary N-acetylglucosamine of a biantennary oligosaccharide (Sialyl Lewis X structure). In another embodiment, the Factor VIIa preparation comprises oligosaccharide chains having (i) a fucose linked to a core N-acetylglucosamine and (ii) a single fucose linked α1->3 to one antennary N-acetylglucosamine. In another embodiment, the Factor VIIa preparation comprises oligosaccharide chains having (i) a fucose linked to a core N-acetylglucosamine and (ii) fucose residues linked α1->3 to each antennary N-acetylglucosamine of a biantennary oligosaccharide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn practicing the present invention, the pattern of N-linked oligosaccharides may be determined using any method known in the art, including, without limitation: high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); capillary electrophoresis (CE); nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR); mass spectrometry (MS) using ionization techniques such as fast-atom bombardment, electrospray, or matrix-assisted laser desorption (MALDI); gas chromatography (GC); and treatment with exoglycosidases in conjunction with anion-exchange (AIE)-HPLC, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), or MS. See, e.g., \nWeber et al., Anal. Biochem. 225:135 (1995\n); \nKlausen et al., J. Chromatog. 718:195 (1995\n); \nMorris et al., in Mass Spectrometry of Biological Materials, McEwen et al., eds., Marcel Dekker, (1990), pp 137-167\n; \nConboy et al., Biol. Mass Spectrom. 21:397, 1992\n; \nHellerqvist, Meth. Enzymol. 193:554 (1990\n); \nSutton et al., Anal. Biohcem. 318:34 (1994\n); \nHarvey et al., Organic Mass Spectrometry 29:752 (1994\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing resolution of Factor VII-derived oligosaccharide chains using any of the above methods (or any other method that resolves oligosaccharide chains having different structures), the resolved species are assigned, e.g., to one of groups (i)-(v). The relative content of each of (i)-(v) is calculated as the sum of the oligosaccharides assigned to that group relative to the total content of oligosaccharide chains in the sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, using AIE-HPLC, 13 or more N-linked oligosaccharide peaks can be resolved from a recombinant Factor VII preparation produced in BHK cells. See, e.g., Klausen et al., \nMol. Biotechnol.\n 9:195, 1998. Five of the peaks (designated 1-5 in Klausen et al.) do not contain sialic acid, while eight of the peaks (designated 6, 7, and 10-15) do contain sialic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood that, in a given analysis, the number and distribution of sialic acid-containing and sialic acid-lacking chains may depend upon (a) the polypeptide being expressed; (b) the cell type and culture conditions; and (c) the method of analysis that is employed, and that the resulting patterns may vary accordingly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn any case, once the sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides have been resolved from the non-sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides, conventional data analysis programs are used to calculate the area under each peak; the total peak area; and the percentage of the total peak area represented by a particular peak. In this manner, for a given preparation, the sum of the areas of sialic acid-containing peaks/total peak area X 100 yields the % sialylation value for the preparation according to the present invention (i.e., the proportion of oligosaccharide chains having at least one sialic acid residue). In a similar manner, the % of chains having no sialic acid or at least one galactose or N-acetylglucosamine can be calculated.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMethods for Producing Factor VII Preparations Having a Predetermined Pattern of N-linked Oligosaccharides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPreparations of Factor VII, Factor VII variants, or Factor VII-related polypeptides, each having a predetermined pattern of N-linked oligosaccharides, may be produced using any appropriate host cell that expresses Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nHost cells\n: In some embodiments, the host cells are human cells expressing an endogenous Factor VII gene. In these cells, the endogenous gene may be intact or may have been modified \nin situ,\n or a sequence outside the Factor VII gene may have been modified \nin situ\n to alter the expression of the endogenous Factor VII gene. Any human cell capable of expressing an endogenous Factor VII gene may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, heterologous host cells are programmed to express human Factor VII from a recombinant gene. The host cells may be vertebrate, insect, or fungal cells. Preferably, the cells are mammalian cells capable of the entire spectrum of mammalian N-linked glycosylation; O-linked glycosylation; and γ-carboxylation. See, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 4,784,950\n \n. Preferred mammalian cell lines include the CHO (ATCC CCL 61), COS-1 (ATCC CRL 1650), baby hamster kidney (BHK) and HEK293 (ATCC CRL 1573; \nGraham et al., J. Gen. Virol. 36:59-72, 1977\n) cell lines. A preferred BHK cell line is the tk\n-\n ts13 BHK cell line (\nWaechter and Baserga, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 79:1106-1110, 1982\n), hereinafter referred to as BHK 570 cells. The BHK 570 cell line is available from the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20852, under ATCC accession number CRL 10314. A tk\n-\n ts13 BHK cell line is also available from the ATCC under accession number CRL 1632. In addition, a number of other cell lines may be used, including Rat Hep I (Rat hepatoma; ATCC CRL 1600), Rat Hep II (Rat hepatoma; ATCC CRL 1548), TCMK (ATCC CCL 139), Human lung (ATCC HB 8065), NCTC 1469 (ATCC CCL 9.1) and DUKX cells (CHO cell line) (\nUrlaub and Chasin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216-4220, 1980\n). (DUKX cells also referred to as CXB11 cells), and DG44 (CHO cell line) (\nCell, 33:405, 1983\n, and \nSomatic Cell and Molecular Genetics 12:555, 1986\n). Also useful are 3T3 cells, Namalwa cells, myelomas and fusions of myelomas with other cells. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the host cells are BHK 21 cells that have been adapted to grow in the absence of serum and have been programmed to express Factor VII. In some embodiments, the cells may be mutant or recombinant cells that express a qualitatively or quantitatively different spectrum of glycosylation enzymes (such as, e.g., glycosyl transferases and/or glycosidases) than the cell type from which they were derived. The cells may also be programmed to express other heterologous peptides or proteins, including, e.g., truncated forms of Factor VII. In one embodiment, the host cells are CHO cells that have been programmed to co-express both the Factor VII polypeptide of interest (i.e., Factor VII or a Factor-VII-related polypeptide) and another heterologous peptide or polypeptide such as, e.g., a modifying enzyme or a Factor VII fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMethods\n: The present invention encompasses methods for producing a preparation comprising any of the glycoform patterns described above as (i)-(vi) and, in further embodiments, methods for optimizing the glycoform distribution of Factor VII and Factor VII-related polypeptides. These methods are carried out by the steps of:\n\n \n \n \n(a) culturing a cell expressing Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides under a first set of predetermined culture conditions;\n \n(b) recovering Factor VII or FactorVII-related polypeptides from the culture to obtain a preparation comprising the polypeptides; and\n \n(c) analyzing the structure of the oligosaccharides linked to the polypeptides to determine a glycoform pattern.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe methods may further comprise:\n\n \n \n \n(d1) altering the culture conditions of step (a) to achieve a second set of predetermined culture conditions;\n \n(e1) repeating steps (b)-(d1) until a desired glycoform pattern is achieved. Alternatively, the methods may further comprise\n \n(d2) treating the preparation chemically and/or enzymatically to alter the oligosaccharide structure; and\n \n(e2) repeating steps (b)-(d2) until a desired glycoform pattern is achieved.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThese methods may further comprise the step of subjecting preparations having predetermined glycoform patterns to at least one test of bioactivity (including, e.g., clotting, Factor X proteolysis, or TF binding) or other functionality (such as, e.g., pharmacokinetic profile or stability), and correlating particular glycoform patterns with particular bioactivity or functionality profiles in order to identify a desired glycoform pattern.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe variables in the culture conditions that may be altered in step (d1) include, without limitation: the cell of origin, such as, e.g., a cell derived from a different species than originally used; or a mutant or recombinant cell having alterations in one or more glycosyl-transferases or glycosidases or other components of the glycosylation apparatus (see, \nGrabenhorst et al., Glycoconjugate J. 16:81, 1999\n; \nBragonzi et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1474:273, 2000\n; \nWeikert, Nature Biotechnol. 17:1116, 1999\n); the level of expression of the polypeptide; the metabolic conditions such as, e.g., glucose or glutamine concentration; the absence or presence of serum; the concentration of vitamin K; protein hydrolysates, hormones, trace metals, salts as well as process parameters like temperature, dissolved oxygen level and pH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enzymatic treatments that may be used in step (d2) to modify the oligosaccharide pattern of a preparation include, without limitation, treatment with one or more of sialidase (neuraminidase), galactosidase, fucosidase; galactosyl transferase, fucosyl transferase, and/or sialyltransferase, in a sequence and under conditions that achieve a desired modification in the distribution of oligosaccharide chains having particular terminal structures. Glycosyl transferases are commercially available from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and glycosidases are commercially available from Glyko, Inc., (Novato, CA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one series of embodiments, host cells expressing Factor VII or a related polypeptide are subjected to specific culture conditions in which they secrete glycosylated Factor VII polypeptides having the desired pattern of oligosaccharide structures described above as any of (i)-(vi). Such culture conditions include, without limitation, a reduction in, or complete absence of, serum. Preferably, the host cells are adapted to grow in the absence of serum and are cultured in the absence of serum both in the growth phase and in the production phase. Such adaptation procedures are described, e.g., in \nScharfenberg, et al., Animal Cell Technology Developments towards the 21st Century, E. C. Beuvery et al. (Eds.), Kluwer Academic Publishers, pp. 619-623, 1995\n (BHK and CHO cells); \nCruz, Biotechnol. Tech. 11:117-120, 1997\n (insect cells); \nKeen, Cytotechnol. 17:203-211, 1995\n (myeloma cells); \nBerg et al., Biotechniques 14:972-978, 1993\n (human kidney 293 cells). In a preferred embodiment, the growth medium that is added to the cells contains no protein or other component that was isolated from an animal tissue or an animal cell culture. See, e.g., Example 1 below. Typically, in addition to conventional components, a medium suitable for producing Factor VII contains Vitamin K at a concentration between 0.1-50 mg/liter, which is required for γ-carboxylation of glutamine residues in Factor VII.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another series of embodiments, the glycoforms of the invention are produced by subjecting a preparation of Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides to enzymatic and/or chemical modification of the N-linked oligosaccharides contained therein.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFactor VII Preparations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, a \"Factor VII preparation\" refers to a plurality of Factor VII polypeptides, Factor VIIa polypeptides, or Factor VII-related polypeptides, including variants and chemically modified forms, that have been separated from the cell in which they were synthesized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeparation of polypeptides from their cell of origin may be achieved by any method known in the art, including, without limitation, removal of cell culture medium containing the desired product from an adherent cell culture; centrifugation or filtration to remove non-adherent cells; and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, Factor VII polypeptides may be further purified. Purification may be achieved using any method known in the art, including, without limitation, affinity chromatography, such as, e.g., on an anti-Factor VII antibody column (see, e.g., \nWakabayashi et al., J. Biol. Chem. 261:11097, 1986\n; and \nThim et al., Biochem. 27:7785, 1988\n); hydrophobic interaction chromatography; ion-exchange chromatography; size exclusion chromatography; electrophoretic procedures (\ne\n.\ng\n., preparative isoelectric focusing (IEF), differential solubility (\ne\n.\ng\n., ammonium sulfate precipitation), or extraction and the like. See, generally, \nScopes, Protein Purification, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1982\n; and \nProtein Purification, J.-C. Janson and Lars Ryden, editors, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989\n. Following purification, the preparation preferably contains less than about 10% by weight, more preferably less than about 5% and most preferably less than about 1%, of non-Factor VII proteins derived from the host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor VII and Factor VII-related polypeptides may be activated by proteolytic cleavage, using Factor Xlla or other proteases having trypsin-like specificity, such as, e.g., Factor IXa, kallikrein, Factor Xa, and thrombin. See, e.g., \nOsterud et al., Biochem. 11:2853 (1972\n); \n \nThomas, U.S. Patent No. 4,456,591\n \n; and \nHedner et al., J. Clin. Invest. 71:1836 (1983\n). Alternatively, Factor VII may be activated by passing it through an ion-exchange chromatography column, such as Mono Q® (Pharmacia) or the like. The resulting activated Factor VII may then be formulated and administered as described below.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFunctional Properties of Factor VII Preparations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe preparations of Factor VII polypeptides and Factor VII-related polypeptides having predetermined oligosaccharide patterns according to the invention exhibit improved functional properties relative to reference preparations. The improved functional properties may include, without limitation, a) physical properties such as, e.g., storage stability; b) pharmacokinetic properties such as, e.g., bioavailability and half-life; and c) immunogenicity in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA reference preparation refers to a preparation comprising a polypeptide that is identical to that contained in the preparation of the invention to which it is being compared (such as, e.g., wild-type Factor VII or a particular variant or chemically modified form) except for exhibiting a different pattern of asparagine-linked glycosylation. For example, reference preparations typically comprise one or more of the following glycoform patterns: (i) less than about 93% (such as, e.g. less than about 92% or less than about 90%) of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue; (ii) at least about 6% (such as, e.g., at least about 7.5% or at least about 10%) of the oligosaccharide chains lack any sialic acid (i.e., are neutral); (iii) at least about 10% (such as, e.g., at least about 12.5% or at least about 15%) of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one terminal galactose residue; (iv) at least about 15% (such as, e.g., at least about 20% or at least about 25%) of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; (v) at least about 25% (such as, e.g., at least about 30% or at least about 35%) of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one uncapped antenna (i.e., contain at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue); or (vi) essentially undetectable levels (such as, e.g., less than about 0.2%) of antennary fucose residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStorage stability of a Factor VII preparation may be assessed by measuring (a) the time required for 20% of the bioactivity of a preparation to decay when stored as a dry powder at 25°C and/or (b) the time required for a doubling in the proportion of Factor VIIa aggregates in the preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the preparations of the invention exhibit an increase of at least about 30%, preferably at least about 60% and more preferably at least about 100%, in the time required for 20% of the bioactivity to decay relative to the time required for the same phenomenon in a reference preparation, when both preparations are stored as dry powders at 25°C. Bioactivity measurements may be performed using any of a clotting assay, proteolysis assay, TF-binding assay, or TF-independent thrombin generation assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the preparations of the invention exhibit an increase of at least about 30%, preferably at least about 60%, and more preferably at least about 100%, in the time required for doubling of aggregates relative to a reference preparation, when both preparations are stored as dry powders at 25°C. The content of aggregates is determined by gel permeation HPLC on a Protein Pak 300 SW column (7.5 x 300 mm) (Waters, 80013) as follows. The column is equilibrated with Eluent A (0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 5 % isopropanol, pH adjusted to 2.5 with phosphoric acid, and thereafter pH is adjusted to 7.0 with triethylamine), after which 25 µg of sample is applied to the column. Elution is with Eluent A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 30 min, and detection is achieved by measuring absorbance at 215 nm. The content of aggregates is calculated as the peak area of the Factor VII aggregates/total area of Factor VII peaks (monomer and aggregates).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Bioavailability\" refers to the proportion of an administered dose of a Factor VII or Factor VII-related preparation that can be detected in plasma at predetermined times after administration. Typically, bioavailability is measured in test animals by administering a dose of between about 25-250 µg/kg of the preparation; obtaining plasma samples at predetermined times after administration; and determining the content of Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides in the samples using one or more of a clotting assay (or any bioassay), an immunoassay, or an equivalent. The data are typically displayed graphically as [Factor VII] v. time and the bioavailability is expressed as the area under the curve (AUC). Relative bioavailability of a test preparation refers to the ratio between the AUC of the test preparation and that of the reference preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the preparations of the present invention exhibit a relative bioavailability of at least about 110%, preferably at least about 120%, more preferably at least about 130% and most preferably at least about 140% of the bioavailability of a reference preparation. The bioavailability may be measured in any mammalian species, preferably dogs, and the predetermined times used for calculating AUC may encompass different increments from 10 min- 8 h.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Half-life\" refers to the time required for the plasma concentration of Factor VII polypeptides of Factor VII-related polypeptides to decrease from a particular value to half of that value. Half-life may be determined using the same procedure as for bioavailability. In some embodiments, the preparations of the present invention exhibit an increase in half-life of at least about 0.25 h, preferably at least about 0.5 h, more preferably at least about 1 h, and most preferably at least about 2 h, relative to the half-life of a reference preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Immunogenicity\" of a preparation refers to the ability of the preparation, when administered to a human, to elicit a deleterious immune response, whether humoral, cellular, or both. Factor VIIa polypeptides and Factor VIIa-related polypeptides are not known to elicit detectable immune responses in humans. Nonetheless, in any human sub-population, there may exist individuals who exhibit sensitivity to particular administered proteins. Immunogenicity may be measured by quantifying the presence of anti-Factor VII antibodies and/or Factor VII-responsive T-cells in a sensitive individual, using conventional methods known in the art. In some embodiments, the preparations of the present invention exhibit a decrease in immunogenicity in a sensitive individual of at least about 10%, preferably at least about 25%, more preferably at least about 40% and most preferably at least about 50%, relative to the immunogenicity for that individual of a reference preparation.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe preparations of the present invention may be used to treat any Factor VII-responsive syndrome, such as, e.g., bleeding disorders, including, without limitation, those caused by clotting factor deficiencies (e.g., haemophilia A and B or deficiency of coagulation factors XI or VII); by thrombocytopenia or von Willebrand's disease, or by clotting factor inhibitors, or excessive bleeding from any cause. The preparations may also be administered to patients in association with surgery or other trauma or to patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations comprising Factor VII-related polypeptides according to the invention, which have substantially reduced bioactivity relative to wild-type Factor VII, may be used as anticoagulants, such as, e.g., in patients undergoing angioplasty or other surgical procedures that may increase the risk of thrombosis or occlusion of blood vessels as occurs, e.g., in restenosis. Other medical indications for which anticoagulants are prescribed include, without limitation, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), fibrin deposition in lungs and kidneys associated with gram-negative endotoxemia, myocardial infarction; Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), MOF, and TTP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions comprising the Factor VII and Factor VII-related preparations according to the present are primarily intended for parenteral administration for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment. Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered parenterally, i.e., intravenously, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly. They may be administered by continuous or pulsatile infusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions or formulations comprise a preparation according to the invention in combination with, preferably dissolved in, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, preferably an aqueous carrier or diluent. A variety of aqueous carriers may be used, such as water, buffered water, 0.4% saline, 0.3% glycine and the like. The preparations of the invention can also be formulated into liposome preparations for delivery or targeting to the sites of injury. Liposome preparations are generally described in, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patents Nos. 4,837,028\n \n, \n \n4,501,728,\n \n and \n \n4,975,282\n \n. The compositions may be sterilised by conventional, well-known sterilisation techniques. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use or filtered under aseptic conditions and lyophilised, the lyophilised preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous solution prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances or adjuvants, including, without limitation, pH adjusting and buffering agents and/or tonicity adjusting agents, such as, for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concentration of Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides in these formulations can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.5% by weight, usually at or at least about 1 % by weight to as much as 15 or 20% by weight and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, a typical pharmaceutical composition for intravenous infusion could be made up to contain 250 ml of sterile Ringer's solution and 10 mg of the preparation. Actual methods for preparing parenterally administrable compositions will be known or apparent to those skilled in the art and are described in more detail in, for example, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA (1990\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions containing the preparations of the present invention can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a subject already suffering from a disease, as described above, in an amount sufficient to cure, alleviate or partially arrest the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as \"therapeutically effective amount\". Effective amounts for each purpose will depend on the severity of the disease or injury as well as the weight and general state of the subject. In general, however, the effective amount will range from about 0.05 mg up to about 500 mg of the preparation per day for a 70 kg subject, with dosages of from about 1.0 mg to about 200 mg of the preparation per day being more commonly used. It will be understood that determining an appropriate dosage may be achieved using routine experimentation, by constructing a matrix of values and testing different points in the matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLocal delivery of the preparations of the present invention, such as, for example, topical application, may be carried out, e.g., by means of a spray, perfusion, double balloon catheters, stent, incorporated into vascular grafts or stents, hydrogels used to coat balloon catheters, or other well established methods. In any event, the pharmaceutical compositions should provide a quantity of the preparation sufficient to effectively treat the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may further comprise other bioactive agents, such as, e.g., non-Factor VII-related coagulants or anticoagulants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are intended as non-limiting illustrations of the present invention.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 1: Production and Analysis of a Factor VII preparation exhibiting an altered glycoform pattern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following experiment was performed to produce a Factor VII preparation having an altered glycoform pattern.\n\n\n \nI. \nProduction\n: A BHK cell line transformed with a Factor VII-encoding plasmid was adapted to growth in suspension culture in the absence of serum. The cells were propagated sequentially in spinner cultures and as the cell number increased, the volume was gradually increased by addition of new medium.\n\n\n \n \n \nFinally, 6 I of seed culture were inoculated into a 100-liter production bioreactor containing macroporous Cytopore 1 carriers (Pharmacia), after which the suspension cells became immobilized in the carriers. The culture was maintained at 36°C at a pH of 6.7-6.9 and a DO of 50%. The volume in the production bioreactor was gradually increased by addition of new medium as the cell number increased. When the cell density reached approximately 2 x 10\n6\n cells/ml, the production phase was initiated and a medium change was performed every 24 hours: Agitation was stopped to allow for sedimentation of the cell-containing carriers, and 80% of the culture supernatant was then harvested and replaced with new medium. The harvested culture supernatant was filtered to remove non-trapped cells and cell debris and was then transferred for further processing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring the production phase the cells reached 3-6 x 10\n6\n cells/ml and a titer of 2-7 mg Factor VII/liter.\n\n\n \nII. \n \nAnalysis of the glycoform pattern of recombinant Factor VII\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe oligosaccharide patterns of the following preparations were compared: (a) recombinant Factor VII preparations produced as described in part I (n=7); and two reference preparations: (b) recombinant Factor VII preparations produced in BHK cells in the presence of calf serum (n=10); and (c) a Factor VII preparation purified from human plasma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe N-linked oligosaccharides were released from the polypeptides by chemical cleavage (hydrazinolysis, on a GlycoPrep1000 unit, Oxford GlycoSciences) or by enzymatic cleavage (N-glycosidase F from, eg., Boehringer Mannheim). The released oligosaccharides were labeled with 2-aminobenzamide (using a signal labelling kit, K-404, Oxford GlycoSciences or Glyko). The labeled oligosaccharides were analysed using anion-exchange HPLC on a CarboPac PA100 column (4x250 mm, Dionex, P/N 43055) with a Guard column (4x50 mm, Dionex, P/N 43054). The column was equilibrated with 150 mM sodium hydroxide and eluted with a gradient of 0-150 mM sodium acetate, 150 mM sodium hydroxide. Oligosaccharides were detected using fluorescence, with excitation at 330 nm and emission at 420 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe relative contents of the various Factor VII oligosaccharide structures (Klausen et al., 1998) were calculated as the relative peak areas for the carbohydrate peaks in the anion-exchange HPLC analysis. Based on the structural elements of each oligosaccharide, it was assigned to one of the following: (i) chains containing at least one sialic acid; (ii) chains lacking any sialic acid (i.e., neutral); (iii) chains containing at least one terminal galactose residue; (iv) chains containing at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; and (v) chains containing at least one uncapped antenna (i.e., at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue). Finally, the sum of the relative contents of the oligosaccharide chains assigned to each group was calculated as a percentage of the total oligosaccharide chains. The standard deviation of this determination was calculated to be 0.08% (intraday variation); 0.7% (day-to-day variation); and 0.5% (1-100 µg interval).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting glycoform patterns are illustrated in the following table:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(i)\n \n \n \n(ii)\n \n \n \n(iii)\n \n \n \n(iv)\n \n \n \n(v)\n \n \n \n \n \n \na\n \n \n93.1-98.7\n \n1.3-6.9\n \n5.9-16.4\n \n5.9-8.7\n \n11.7-23.9\n \n \n \n \nb\n \n \n88.3-92.5\n \n7.5-12.9\n \n9.4-16.8\n \n19.0-28.6\n \n30.1-39.0\n \n \n \n \nc\n \n \n99.5%\n \n<0.5%\n \n2-3%\n \n0%\n \n2-3%\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nThe recombinant Factor VII preparations produced according to this Example (i.e., in the absence of serum) exhibit a glycoform pattern that differs from both the glycoform pattern of recombinant Factor VII produced in the presence of serum and native Factor VII isolated from human plasma. The oligosaccharides of recombinant Factor VII produced in the absence of serum are sialylated to a higher extent than those produced in the presence of serum and contain less neutral chains and less chains that terminate in either galactose or N-acetylgalatosamine.\n\n\n\n\n \nIII. \nBioavailability:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe following experiment was performed to compare the bioavailability of two Factor VII preparations produced as above (I and II) with that of two reference Factor VII preparations (i.e., produced in the presence of serum) (A and B).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroups of 8 rats were administered either a test preparation or a reference preparation at a dose of 25 µg/kg (= 100 µg/rat) in a glycylglycine buffer (pH 7.4) containing sodium chloride (7.87 mg/ml), calcium chloride dihydrate (1.48 mg/ml), mannitol (2.5 mg/ml) and polysorbate 80. Blood samples were withdrawn at 10 min and 30 min following the initial administration. Plasma was obtained from the samples and Factor VII was quantified by ELISA. Bioavailability of each sample is expressed as the dose-adjusted area under the plasma concentration curve for Factor VII based on the 10 and 30-min samples (AUC\n10-30\n/dose). The relative bioavailability is expressed as the ratio between the mean AUC\n10-30\n/dose of the test and reference samples X 100. The 90% confidence limits for the relative bioavailability were calculated from the 90% confidence limits for differences between preparations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are summarized in the Table below.

A 10% increase in the % sialylation, moreover, causes a 40-50% increase in bioavailability.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2: \nAnalysis of Factor VII preparations exhibiting an altered glycoform pattern\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFactor VII was produced as described in Example 1 above, with the exception that the Factor VII was harvested from 500-I cultures. Glycoform analysis was performed as described in Example 1. Three independent preparations (A, B, and C) were analyzed and compared with a reference preparation (D).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBioavailability was measured in a dog model as follows: The experiment was performed as a four leg cross-over study in 12 Beagle dogs divided in four groups. All animals received each of the three test preparations A, B, and C and the reference preparation D at a dose of ≈90 µg/kg in a glycylglycine buffer (pH 5.5) containing sodium chloride (2.92 mg/ml), calcium chloride dihydrate (1.47 mg/ml), mannitol (30 mg/ml) and polysorbate 80. Blood samples were withdrawn at 10, 30, and 60 minutes and 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 hours following the initial administration. Plasma was obtained from the samples and Factor VII was quantified by ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBioavailability of each sample is expressed as the dose-adjusted area under the plasma concentration curve for Factor VII (AUC/dose). The relative bioavailability is expressed as the ratio between the mean AUC/dose of the test and reference preparation X 100 and 90% confidence limits for the relative bioavailability were calculated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are summarized in the Table below.

A 10% increase in the % sialylation causes a 30-50% increase in bioavailability with a close to linear relationship for the three test preparations and the reference preparation\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 3: Factor VII preparations exhibiting an altered glycoform pattern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following experiment was performed to produce a Factor VII preparation having an altered glycoform pattern.\n\n\n \nI\n. Construction of cell line and Factor VII production\n:\n\n\n \n \n \nA plasmid vector pLN174 for expression of human FVII has been described (\nPersson and Nielsen. 1996. FEBS Lett. 385: 241-243\n). Briefly, it carries the cDNA nucleotide sequence encoding human FVII including the propeptide under the control of a mouse metallothionein promoter for transcription of the inserted cDNA, and mouse dihydrofolate reductase cDNA under the control of an SV40 early promoter for use as a selectable marker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor construction of a plasmid vector encoding a gamma-carboxylation recognition sequence, a cloning vector (pBluescript II KS+, Stratagene) containing cDNA encoding FVII including its propeptide was used (pLN171). (\nPersson et al. 1997. J. Biol. Chem. 272: 19919-19924\n). A nucleotide sequence encoding a stop codon was inserted into the cDNA encoding FVII after the propeptide of FVII by inverse PCR-mediated mutagenesis using this cloning vector. The template plasmid was denatured by treatment with NaOH followed by PCR with Pwo (Boehringer-Mannheim) and Taq (Perkin-Elmer) polymerases with the following primers:\n\n \n \n \na) 5'-AGC GTT TTA GCG CCG GCG CCG GTG CAG GAC-3'\n \nb) 5'-CGC CGG CGC TAA AAC GCT TTC CTG GAG GAG CTG CGG CC-3'\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe resulting mix was digested with Dpnl to digest residual template DNA and \nEscherichia coli\n were transformed with the PCR product. Clones were screened for the presence of the mutation by sequencing. The cDNA from a correct clone was transferred as a BamHI-EcoRI fragment to the expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was termed pLN329. CHO K1 cells (ATCC CCI61) were transfected with equal amounts of pLN174 and pLN329 with the Fugene6 method (Boehriner-Mannheim). Transfectants were selected by the addition of methotrexate to 1µM and G-418 to 0.45 mg/ml. The pool of transfectants were cloned by limiting dilution and FVII expression from the clones was measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA high producing clone was further subcloned and a clone E11 with a specific FVII expression of 2.4 pg/cell/day in Dulbecco-modified Eagle's medium with 10 % fetal calf serum was selected. The clone was adapted to serum free suspension culture in a commercially available CHO medium (JRH Bioscience) free of animal derived components.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe adapted cells were propagated sequentially in spinner cultures and as the cell number increased, the volume was gradually increased by addition of new medium. After 25 days, 6 I of spinner culture were inoculated into a 50-liter bioreactor. The cells were propagated in the bioreactor and as the cell number increased, the volume was gradually increased by addition of new medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, 50 l of seed culture were inoculated into a 500-liter production bioreactor containing macroporous Cytopore 1 carriers (Pharmacia), after which the suspension cells became immobilized in the carriers. The culture was maintained at 36°C at a pH of 7.0-7.1 and a Dissolved Oxygen Tension (DOT) of 50% of saturation. The volume in the bioreactor was gradually increased by addition of new medium as the cell number increased. When the cell density reached approximately 10-12 x 105 cells/ml, the production phase was initiated and a medium change was performed every 24 hours: agitation was stopped to allow for sedimentation of the cell-containing carriers, and 80% of the culture supernatant was then harvested and replaced with new medium. The harvested culture supernatant was filtered to remove non-trapped cells (i.e. cells that were not immobilized in carriers) and cell debris and was then transferred for further processing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring the production phase the cells reached 2-3 x 107 cells/ml and a titer of 8 mg Factor VII/liter.\n\n\n \nII. \nGlycoform Analysis:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nA. The oligosaccharide pattern of a Factor VII preparation produced as described above (a) was compared with those of (b) recombinant Factor VII preparations produced in BHK cells in the presence of calf serum and (c) a Factor VII preparation purified from human plasma. The methods used were essentially as described in Example 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are shown in the Table below. The oligosaccharide assignments are as follows: (i) chains containing at least one sialic acid; (ii) chains lacking any sialic acid (i.e., neutral); (iii) chains containing at least one terminal galactose residue; (iv) chains containing at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; and (v) chains containing at least one uncapped antenna (i.e., at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue).\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(i)\n \n \n \n(ii)\n \n \n \n(iii)\n \n \n \n(iv)\n \n \n \n(v)\n \n \n \n \n \n \na\n \n \n95.2\n \n4.8\n \n22.9\n \n0.1\n \n23.0\n \n \n \n \nb\n \n \n88.3-92.5\n \n7.5-12.9\n \n9.4-16.8\n \n19.0-28.6\n \n30.1-39.0\n \n \n \n \nc\n \n \n99.5%\n \n<0.5%\n \n2-3%\n \n0%\n \n2-3%\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. The oligosaccharide patterns of five independent Factor VII preparations produced as described in this Example (a) were compared with those of (b) recombinant Factor VII preparations produced in BHK cells in the presence of calf serum and (c) a Factor VII preparation purified from human plasma, using the analytical methods described in Example 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the structural elements of each oligosaccharide, it was assigned to one of the following: (i) chains containing at least one sialic acid; (ii) chains lacking any sialic acid (i.e., neutral); (iii) chains containing at least one fucose linked to the antenna. Finally, the sum of the relative contents of the oligosaccharide chains assigned to each group was calculated as a percentage of the total oligosaccharide chains. The standard deviation of this determination was calculated to be 0.08% (intraday variation); 0.7% (day-to-day variation); and 0.5% (1-100 µg interval).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting glycoform patterns are illustrated in the following Table:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(i)\n \n(ii)\n \n(iii)\n \n \n \n \na\n \n89.0-97.9%\n \n2.1-11.0%\n \n6.3-21.3%\n \n \n \nb\n \n88.3-92.5%\n \n7.5-12.9%\n \n0%\n \n \n \nc\n \n99.5%\n \n<0.5%\n \n0%\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recombinant Factor VII preparations produced according to Example 1 (i.e., produced in the absence of serum by the CHO cell line) exhibit a glycoform pattern that differs from both the glycoform pattern of recombinant Factor VII produced in the presence of serum and native Factor VII isolated from human plasma. The oligosaccharides of recombinant Factor VII produced in the absence of serum by the CHO 282.4 cell line include structures with fucose linked to the antenna, which are absent from both of the reference preparations. Two of the structures have been purified and characterized by matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry, by treatment with linkage specific fucosidase enzymes and by anion-exchange HPLC as described above. The two structures have been shown to contain the sialyl Lewis x structure, i.e., fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine in a sialylated oligosaccharide.\n\n\n \nIII. \nBioactivity\n:\n\n\n \n \n \nFive Factor VII preparations produced as described in this Example were analyzed for (a) thrombin generation and (b) binding to tissue factor (TF) and compared with recombinant Factor VII produced in BHK cells in the presence of serum (reference).

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compositions comprising Factor VII and other blood clotting factors having altered patterns of asparagine-linked glycosylation.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBackground of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe proteins involved in the clotting cascade, including, e.g., Factor VII, Factor VIII, Factor IX, Factor X, and Protein C, are proving to be useful therapeutic agents to treat a variety of pathological conditions. Accordingly, there is an increasing need for formulations comprising these proteins that are pharmaceutically acceptable and exhibit a uniform and predetermined clinical efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause of the many disadvantages of using human plasma as a source of pharmaceutical products, it is preferred to produce these proteins in recombinant systems. The clotting proteins, however, are subject to a variety of co- and post-translational modifications, including, e.g., asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycosylation; O-linked glycosylation; and γ-carboxylation of glu residues. These modifications may be qualitatively or quantitatively different when heterologous cells are used as hosts for large-scale production of the proteins. In particular, production in heterologous cells often results in a different array of glycoforms, which are identical polypeptides having different covalently linked oligosaccharide structures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn different systems, variations in the oligosaccharide structure of therapeutic proteins have been linked to, \ninter alia\n, changes in immunogenicity and \nin vivo\n clearance. Thus, there is a need in the art for compositions and methods that provide clotting protein preparations, particularly preparations comprising recombinant human Factor VII, modified Factor VII, or Factor VII-related polypeptides, that contain predetermined glycoform patterns.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nKemball-Cook et al. (Gene 1994, 139(2): 275-279\n) describes experiments in which small-scale cultures of Factor VII-expressing CHO-K1 cells were incubated in medium lacking serum.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to preparations comprising Factor VII polypeptides exhibit predetermined glycoform patterns. As used herein, a Factor VII preparation refers to a plurality of Factor VII polypeptides, including variants and chemically modified forms, as well as forms that have been proteolytically activated (e.g., Factor VIIa), that have been separated from the cell in which they were synthesized. A glycoform pattern refers to the distribution within the preparation of oligosaccharide chains having varying structures that are covalently linked to Factor VII polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention provides a preparation comprising a plurality of Factor VII polypeptides, wherein the polypeptides comprise asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains and wherein one or more of the following (i)-(iv) applies: (i) between about 94-99% of the oligosaccharide chains comprise at least one sialic acid moiety; (ii) between about 1-7% of the oligosaccharide chains have a neutral charge; (iii) between about 6-16% of the oligosaccharide chains comprise at least one terminal galactose residue; and (iv) between about 11-23% of the oligosaccharide chains comprise at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue; and wherein the preparation exhibits a bioavailability that is at least 110% of the bioavailability of a reference preparation, wherein about 93% or less of the oligosaccharide chains in the reference preparation comprise at least one sialic acid moiety. In some embodiments, in addition to one or more of (i)-(iv): all of the sialic acid residues in the oligosaccharide chains are linked to galactose via an α2->3 linkage; at least some of the sialic acid residues comprise N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) in addition to N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac); and/or the oligosaccharide chains comprise fucose residues linked α1->6 to a core N-acetylglucosamine. In one embodiment, the invention encompasses a preparation comprising wild-type Factor VIIa in which between about 94-99% of the oligosaccharide chains have at least one sialic acid residue and all of the sialic acid residues are linked to galactose via an α2->3 linkage. In another embodiment, the invention encompasses a preparation comprising wild-type Factor VIIa in which between about 94-99% of the oligosaccharide chains have at least one sialic acid residue and at least some of the sialic acid residues are N-glycolylneuraminic acid. The preparations of the present invention thus do not encompass wild-type Factor VII or Factor VIIa that has been isolated from human plasma and has not been modified \nex vivo\n by glycosidase treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a preparation comprising a plurality of Factor VII polypeptides, wherein the polypeptides comprise asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains and wherein at least about 2% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine residue (i.e., an N-acetylglucosamine residue that is linked β1->2,4, or 6 to a Man residue) and wherein the preparation exhibits a bioavailability that is at least 110% of the bioavailability of a reference preparation, wherein about 93% or less of the oligosaccharide chains in the reference preparation comprise at least one sialic acid moiety. Preferably, at least about 5% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one such antennary fucose residue; more preferably, at least about 10% or 20%; and most preferably, at least about 40%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparations according to invention may comprise one or more of unmodified wild-type Factor VII; wild-type Factor VII that has been subjected to chemical and/or enzymatic modification; and Factor VII variants having one or more alterations in amino acid sequence relative to wild-type Factor VII. The preparations of the invention may be derived from human cells expressing Factor VII from an endogenous Factor VII gene or from cells programmed to express Factor VII polypeptide from a recombinant gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods for producing a preparation comprising Factor VII polypeptides having a predetermined pattern of N-linked glycosylation, the methods comprising culturing a cell expressing the polypeptides under conditions in which at least about 94% of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides linked to the Factor VII polypeptides comprise at least one sialic acid residue, e.g., one, two, three, or four sialic acid residues. In some embodiments, the methods are carried out by culturing a cell expressing the polypeptides under conditions in which at least about 5% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine residue. In some embodiments, Factor VII polypeptides, irrespective of their source, are subjected to enzymatic treatments to achieve the desired glycoform patterns.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides pharmaceutical formulations comprising the preparations of the invention and the use thereof for the preparation of a medicament for treating bleeing disorders. The methods comprise administering the pharmaceutical formulations to a patient in need of treatment, under conditions that result in either an enhancement or inhibition in blood clotting. In one series of embodiments, Factor VII preparations are administered when it is desired to enhance blood clotting, such as, e.g., in haemophilia A, haemophilia B, Factor XI deficiency, Factor VII deficiency, thrombocytopenia, or von Willebrand's disease; in syndromes accompanied by the presence of a clotting factor inhibitor; before, during, or after surgery or anticoagulant therapy; or after trauma.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nDetailed Description of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present inventors have discovered that preparations of coagulation proteins having predetermined glycoform patterns exhibit improved functional properties. Accordingly, the present invention relates to methods and compositions that provide these protein preparations. In particular, the invention relates to preparations comprising Factor VII polypeptides having specific predetermined patterns of asparagine-linked (N-linked) oligosaccharides. The preparations of the invention exhibit altered properties, including, without limitation, improved pharmacokinetic properties and improved clinical efficacy. The invention also encompasses pharmaceutical formulations that comprise these preparations, as well as the use of the formulations for the making of medicaments.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFactor VII Polypeptides and Factor VII-Related Polypeptides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention encompasses human Factor VII polypeptides, such as, e.g., those having the amino acid sequence disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,784,950\n \n (wild-type Factor VII). As used herein, \"Factor VII\" or \"Factor VII polypeptide\" encompasses wild-type Factor VII, as well as variants of Factor VII exhibiting substantially the same or improved biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VII. The term \"Factor VII\" is intended to encompass Factor VII polypeptides in their uncleaved (zymogen) form, as well as those that have been proteolytically processed to yield their respective bioactive forms, which may be designated Factor VIIa. Typically, Factor VII is cleaved between residues 152 and 153 to yield Factor VIIa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"Factor VII-related polypeptides\" encompasses polypeptides, including variants, in which the Factor VIIa biological activity has been substantially modified or reduced relative to the activity of wild-type Factor VIIa. These polypeptides include, without limitation, Factor VII or Factor VIIa that has been chemically modified and Factor VII variants into which specific amino acid sequence alterations have been introduced that modify or disrupt the bioactivity of the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe biological activity of Factor VIIa in blood clotting derives from its ability to (i) bind to tissue factor (TF) and (ii) catalyze the proteolytic cleavage of Factor IX or Factor X to produce activated Factor IX or X (Factor IXa or Xa, respectively). For purposes of the invention, Factor VIIa biological activity may be quantified by measuring the ability of a preparation to promote blood clotting using Factor VII-deficient plasma and thromboplastin, as described, e.g., in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,997,864\n \n. In this assay, biological activity is expressed as the reduction in clotting time relative to a control sample and is converted to \"Factor VII units\" by comparison with a pooled human serum standard containing 1 unit/ml Factor VII activity. Alternatively, Factor VIIa biological activity may be quantified by (i) measuring the ability of Factor VIIa to produce of Factor Xa in a system comprising TF embedded in a lipid membrane and Factor X. (\nPersson et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272:19919-19924, 1997\n); (ii) measuring Factor X hydrolysis in an aqueous system (see, Example 5 below); (iii) measuring its physical binding to TF using an instrument based on surface plasmon resonance (\nPersson, FEBS Letts. 413:359-363, 1997\n) (iv) measuring hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate (see, Example 4 below); and (v) measuring generation of thrombin in a TF-independent in vitro system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor VII variants having substantially the same or improved biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VIIa encompass those that exhibit at least about 25%, preferably at least about 50%, more preferably at least about 75% and most preferably at least about 90% of the specific activity of wild-type Factor VIIa that has been produced in the same cell type, when tested in one or more of a clotting assay, proteolysis assay, or TF binding assay as described above. Factor VII variants having substantially reduced biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VIIa are those that exhibit less than about 25%, preferably less than about 10%, more preferably less than about 5% and most preferably less than about 1% of the specific activity of wild-type Factor VIIa that has been produced in the same cell type when tested in one or more of a clotting assay, proteolysis assay, or TF binding assay as described above. Factor VII variants having a substantially modified biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VII include, without limitation, Factor VII variants that exhibit TF-independent Factor X proteolytic activity and those that bind TF but do not cleave Factor X.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVariants of Factor VII, whether exhibiting substantially the same or better bioactivity than wild-type Factor VII, or, alternatively, exhibiting substantially modified or reduced bioactivity relative to wild-type Factor VII, include, without limitation, polypeptides having an amino acid sequence that differs from the sequence of wild-type Factor VII by insertion, deletion, or substitution of one or more amino acids. Non-limiting examples of Factor VII variants having substantially the same biological activity as wild-type Factor VII include S52A-FVIIa, S60A-FVlla (\nlino et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 352: 182-192, 1998\n); FVIIa variants exhibiting increased proteolytic stability as disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,580,560\n \n; Factor VIIa that has been proteolytically cleaved between residues 290 and 291 or between residues 315 and 316 (\nMollerup et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 48:501-505, 1995\n); and oxidized forms of Factor VIIa (\nKornfelt et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 363:43-54, 1999\n). Non-limiting examples of Factor VII variants having substantially reduced or modified biological activity relative to wild-type Factor VII include R152E-FVIIa (\nWildgoose et al., Biochem 29:3413-3420, 1990\n), S344A-FVIIa (\nKazama et al., J. Biol. Chem. 270:66-72, 1995\n), FFR-FVIIa (\nHolst et al., Eur. J. Vasc. Endovasc. Surg. 15:515-520, 1998\n), and Factor VIIa lacking the Gla domain, (\nNicolaisen et al., FEBS Letts. 317:245-249, 1993\n). Non-limiting examples of chemically modified Factor VII polypeptides and sequence variants are described, e.g., in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 5,997,864\n \n.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAsparagine-Linked Glycosylation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides preparations of Factor VII polypeptides that comprise a particular spectrum of Factor VII glycoforms, i.e., Factor VII polypeptides having predetermined patterns of asparagine-linked (N-linked) oligosaccharide chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a \"pattern\" of N-linked glycosylation or a glycoform \"pattern\", \"distribution\", or \"spectrum\" refers to the representation of particular oligosaccharide structures within a given population of Factor VII polypeptides or Factor VII-related polypeptides. Non-limiting examples of such patterns include the relative proportion of oligosaccharide chains that (i) have at least one sialic acid residue; (ii) lack any sialic acid residues (i.e., are neutral in charge); (iii) have at least one terminal galactose residue; (iv) have at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; (v) have at least one \"uncapped\" antenna, i.e., have at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue; or (vi) have at least one fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an oligosaccharide chain refers to the entire oligosaccharide structure that is covalently linked to a single asparagine residue. Factor VII is normally glycosylated at Asn 145 and Asn 322. An N-linked oligosaccharide chain present on Factor VII produced in a human \nin situ\n may be bi-, tri, or tetraantennary, with each antenna having the structure Neu5Ac(α2->3 or α2->6)Gal(β1->4) GlcNAc linked (β1->2,4, or 6) to a Man residue which is linked (α1->3 or 6) to Man(β1->4)GlcNAc(β1->4)GlcNAc-Asn. (Neu5Ac signifies N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid), Gal signifies galactose, GlcNAc signifies N-acetylglucosamine, and Man signifies mannose). The oligosaccharide chains may also comprise fucose residues, which may be linked α 1->6 to GlcNAc. When Factor VII is produced in a human \nin situ,\n some of the oligosaccharide chains lack core fucose residues; all of the chains lack antennary fucose residues; and all of the chains are almost completely sialylated, i.e., the terminal sugar of each antenna is N-acetylneuraminic acid linked to galactose via an α2->3 or α2->6 linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen produced in other circumstances, however, Factor VII may contain oligosaccharide chains having different terminal structures on one or more of their antennae, such as, e.g., lacking sialic acid residues; containing N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) residues; containing a terminal N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue in place of galactose; and the like. When produced in, e.g., BHK cells cultured in the presence of calf serum, Factor VII preparations exhibit the following oligosaccharide patterns:\n\n \n \n \n-- 87-93% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least a single sialic acid residue;\n \n-- 7-13% are neutral (lack any sialic acid);\n \n-- 9-16% contain at least one terminal galactose residue;\n \n-- 19-29% contain at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; and\n \n-- 30-39% contain at least one uncapped antenna, i.e., contain at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe present inventors have produced Factor VII preparations containing specific predetermined oligosaccharide patterns that differ from those previously described. The preparations comprising Factor VII polypeptides exhibit one or more of the following glycoform patterns:\n\n \n \n \n(i) Between about 94-100% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue, such as, e.g., between about 94-99%, between about 95-98%, or between about 96-97%. In different embodiments, at least about 94%, 95%, 96%, or 97% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue.\n \n(ii) 6% or less of the oligosaccharide chains are neutral, such as, e.g., between about 1.5-6% or between about 2-4%.\n \n(iii) Less than about 16%, preferably, less than about 10% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one terminal galactose, such as, e.g., between about 6-10% or between about 8-9%;\n \n(iv) Less than about 25%, preferably, less than about 10% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one terminal GalNAc residue, such as, e.g., between about 6-9% or between about 7-8%;\n \n(v) Less than about 30, preferably, less than about 25% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one uncapped antenna, such as, e.g., between about 11-23% or between about 12-18%; and\n \n(vi) At least about 2%, preferably, at least about 5%, more preferably, at least about 10% or 20%; and most preferably, at least about 40%, of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine residue (i.e., an N-acetylglucosamine residue that is linked β1->2,4, or 6 to a Man residue).\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIt will be understood that each of (i)-(vi) may represent a distinct glycoform pattern, i.e., a preparation according to the invention may be described by only one of (i)-(vi). Alternatively, depending on the particular glycoform pattern, a preparation encompassed by the invention may be described by more than one of (i)-(vi).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, a preparation encompassed by the invention may be described by one or more of (i)-(vi) in combination with one or more other structural features. For example, the invention encompasses preparations comprising Factor VII polypeptides in which the sialic acid residues (Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc) are linked to galactose exclusively in an α2->3 configuration. The invention also encompasses preparations comprising Factor VII polypeptides that contain fucose linked α 1->6 to a core N-acetylglucosamine and/or fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine. In one series of embodiments, the preparations encompass Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides in which more than 99% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue \nand\n (a) the sialic acid residues are linked exclusively in an α2->3 configuration and/or (b) there are fucose residues linked to core N-acetylglucosamines and/or (c) a detectable number of antenna terminate in N-acetylgalactosamine. In one embodiment, the preparations comprise wild-type Factor VIIa in which more than 99% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue and the sialic acid residues are linked to galactose exclusively in an α2->3 configuration. In another embodiment, the preparations comprise wild-type Factor VIIa in which more than 99% of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue and at least some of the oligosaccharide chains comprise N-acetylgalactosamine. The present invention does not encompass wild-type Factor VII or wild-type Factor VIIa that is isolated from human plasma and is not modified \nex vivo\n by treatment with glycosidases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the Factor VIIa preparation comprises oligosaccharide chains having a single fucose linked α1->3 to one antennary N-acetylglucosamine. In another embodiment, the Factor VIIa preparation comprises oligosaccharide chains having fucose residues linked α1->3 to each antennary N-acetylglucosamine of a biantennary oligosaccharide (Sialyl Lewis X structure). In another embodiment, the Factor VIIa preparation comprises oligosaccharide chains having (i) a fucose linked to a core N-acetylglucosamine and (ii) a single fucose linked α1->3 to one antennary N-acetylglucosamine. In another embodiment, the Factor VIIa preparation comprises oligosaccharide chains having (i) a fucose linked to a core N-acetylglucosamine and (ii) fucose residues linked α1->3 to each antennary N-acetylglucosamine of a biantennary oligosaccharide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn practicing the present invention, the pattern of N-linked oligosaccharides may be determined using any method known in the art, including, without limitation: high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); capillary electrophoresis (CE); nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR); mass spectrometry (MS) using ionization techniques such as fast-atom bombardment, electrospray, or matrix-assisted laser desorption (MALDI); gas chromatography (GC); and treatment with exoglycosidases in conjunction with anion-exchange (AIE)-HPLC, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), or MS.

The relative content of each of (i)-(v) is calculated as the sum of the oligosaccharides assigned to that group relative to the total content of oligosaccharide chains in the sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, using AIE-HPLC, 13 or more N-linked oligosaccharide peaks can be resolved from a recombinant Factor VII preparation produced in BHK cells.

Five of the peaks (designated 1-5 in Klausen et al.) do not contain sialic acid, while eight of the peaks (designated 6, 7, and 10-15) do contain sialic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be understood that, in a given analysis, the number and distribution of sialic acid-containing and sialic acid-lacking chains may depend upon (a) the polypeptide being expressed; (b) the cell type and culture conditions; and (c) the method of analysis that is employed, and that the resulting patterns may vary accordingly.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn any case, once the sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides have been resolved from the non-sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides, conventional data analysis programs are used to calculate the area under each peak; the total peak area; and the percentage of the total peak area represented by a particular peak. In this manner, for a given preparation, the sum of the areas of sialic acid-containing peaks/total peak area X 100 yields the % sialylation value for the preparation according to the present invention (i.e., the proportion of oligosaccharide chains having at least one sialic acid residue). In a similar manner, the % of chains having no sialic acid or at least one galactose or N-acetylglucosamine can be calculated.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMethods for Producing Factor VII Preparations Having a Predetermined Pattern of N-linked Oligosaccharides\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPreparations of Factor VII, Factor VII variants, or Factor VII-related polypeptides, each having a predetermined pattern of N-linked oligosaccharides, may be produced using any appropriate host cell that expresses Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nHost cells\n: In some embodiments, the host cells are human cells expressing an endogenous Factor VII gene. In these cells, the endogenous gene may be intact or may have been modified \nin situ,\n or a sequence outside the Factor VII gene may have been modified \nin situ\n to alter the expression of the endogenous Factor VII gene. Any human cell capable of expressing an endogenous Factor VII gene may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, heterologous host cells are programmed to express human Factor VII from a recombinant gene. The host cells may be vertebrate, insect, or fungal cells. Preferably, the cells are mammalian cells capable of the entire spectrum of mammalian N-linked glycosylation; O-linked glycosylation; and γ-carboxylation. See, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patent Nos. 4,784,950\n \n. Preferred mammalian cell lines include the CHO (ATCC CCL 61), COS-1 (ATCC CRL 1650), baby hamster kidney (BHK) and HEK293 (ATCC CRL 1573; \nGraham et al., J. Gen. Virol. 36:59-72, 1977\n) cell lines. A preferred BHK cell line is the tk\n-\n ts13 BHK cell line (\nWaechter and Baserga, Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA 79:1106-1110, 1982\n), hereinafter referred to as BHK 570 cells. The BHK 570 cell line is available from the American Type Culture Collection, 12301 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20852, under ATCC accession number CRL 10314. A tk\n-\n ts13 BHK cell line is also available from the ATCC under accession number CRL 1632. In addition, a number of other cell lines may be used, including Rat Hep I (Rat hepatoma; ATCC CRL 1600), Rat Hep II (Rat hepatoma; ATCC CRL 1548), TCMK (ATCC CCL 139), Human lung (ATCC HB 8065), NCTC 1469 (ATCC CCL 9.1) and DUKX cells (CHO cell line) (\nUrlaub and Chasin, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77:4216-4220, 1980\n). (DUKX cells also referred to as CXB11 cells), and DG44 (CHO cell line) (\nCell, 33:405, 1983\n, and \nSomatic Cell and Molecular Genetics 12:555, 1986\n). Also useful are 3T3 cells, Namalwa cells, myelomas and fusions of myelomas with other cells. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the host cells are BHK 21 cells that have been adapted to grow in the absence of serum and have been programmed to express Factor VII. In some embodiments, the cells may be mutant or recombinant cells that express a qualitatively or quantitatively different spectrum of glycosylation enzymes (such as, e.g., glycosyl transferases and/or glycosidases) than the cell type from which they were derived. The cells may also be programmed to express other heterologous peptides or proteins, including, e.g., truncated forms of Factor VII. In one embodiment, the host cells are CHO cells that have been programmed to co-express both the Factor VII polypeptide of interest (i.e., Factor VII or a Factor-VII-related polypeptide) and another heterologous peptide or polypeptide such as, e.g., a modifying enzyme or a Factor VII fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nMethods\n: The present invention describes methods for producing a preparation comprising any of the glycoform patterns described above as (i)-(vi) and, in further embodiments, methods for optimizing the glycoform distribution of Factor VII and Factor VII-related polypeptides. These methods are carried out by the steps of:\n\n \n \n \n(a) culturing a cell expressing Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides under a first set of predetermined culture conditions;\n \n(b) recovering Factor VII or FactorVII-related polypeptides from the culture to obtain a preparation comprising the polypeptides; and\n \n(c) analyzing the structure of the oligosaccharides linked to the polypeptides to determine a glycoform pattern.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe methods may further comprise:\n\n \n \n \n(d1) altering the culture conditions of step (a) to achieve a second set of predetermined culture conditions;\n \n(e1) repeating steps (b)-(d1) until a desired glycoform pattern is achieved.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nAlternatively, the methods may further comprise\n\n \n \n \n(d2) treating the preparation chemically and/or enzymatically to alter the oligosaccharide structure; and\n \n(e2) repeating steps (b)-(d2) until a desired glycoform pattern is achieved.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThese methods may further comprise the step of subjecting preparations having predetermined glycoform patterns to at least one test of bioactivity (including, e.g., clotting, Factor X proteolysis, or TF binding) or other functionality (such as, e.g., pharmacokinetic profile or stability), and correlating particular glycoform patterns with particular bioactivity or functionality profiles in order to identify a desired glycoform pattern.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe variables in the culture conditions that may be altered in step (d1) include, without limitation: the cell of origin, such as, e.g., a cell derived from a different species than originally used; or a mutant or recombinant cell having alterations in one or more glycosyl-transferases or glycosidases or other components of the glycosylation apparatus (see, \nGrabenhorst et al., Glycoconjugate J. 16:81, 1999\n;\n Bragonzi et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1474:273, 2000\n; \nWeikert, Nature Biotechnol. 17:1116, 1999\n); the level of expression of the polypeptide; the metabolic conditions such as, e.g., glucose or glutamine concentration; the absence or presence of serum; the concentration of vitamin K; protein hydrolysates, hormones, trace metals, salts as well as process parameters like temperature, dissolved oxygen level and pH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe enzymatic treatments that may be used in step (d2) to modify the oligosaccharide pattern of a preparation include, without limitation, treatment with one or more of sialidase (neuraminidase), galactosidase, fucosidase; galactosyl transferase, fucosyl transferase, and/or sialyltransferase, in a sequence and under conditions that achieve a desired modification in the distribution of oligosaccharide chains having particular terminal structures. Glycosyl transferases are commercially available from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and glycosidases are commercially available from Glyko, Inc., (Novato, CA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one series of embodiments, host cells expressing Factor VII or a related polypeptide are subjected to specific culture conditions in which they secrete glycosylated Factor VII polypeptides having the desired pattern of oligosaccharide structures described above as any of (i)-(vi). Such culture conditions include, without limitation, a reduction in, or complete absence of, serum. Preferably, the host cells are adapted to grow in the absence of serum and are cultured in the absence of serum both in the growth phase and in the production phase. Such adaptation procedures are described, e.g., in\n Scharfenberg, et al., Animal Cell Technology Developments towards the 21st Century, E. C. Beuvery et al. (Eds.), Kluwer Academic Publishers, pp. 619-623, 1995\n (BHK and CHO cells); \nCruz, Biotechnol. Tech. 11:117-120, 1997\n (insect cells); \nKeen, Cytotechnol. 17:203-211, 1995\n (myeloma cells); \nBerg et al., Biotechniques 14:972-978, 1993\n (human kidney 293 cells). In a preferred embodiment, the growth medium that is added to the cells contains no protein or other component that was isolated from an animal tissue or an animal cell culture. See, e.g., Example 1 below. Typically, in addition to conventional components, a medium suitable for producing Factor VII contains Vitamin K at a concentration between 0.1-50 mg/liter, which is required for γ-carboxylation of glutamine residues in Factor VII.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another series of embodiments, the glycoforms of the invention are produced by subjecting a preparation of Factor VII polypeptides to enzymatic and/or chemical modification of the N-linked oligosaccharides contained therein.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFactor VII Preparations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, a \"Factor VII preparation\" refers to a plurality of Factor VII polypeptides, Factor VIIa polypeptides including variants and chemically modified forms, that have been separated from the cell in which they were synthesized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeparation of polypeptides from their cell of origin may be achieved by any method known in the art, including, without limitation, removal of cell culture medium containing the desired product from an adherent cell culture; centrifugation or filtration to remove non-adherent cells; and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOptionally, Factor VII polypeptides may be further purified. Purification may be achieved using any method known in the art, including, without limitation, affinity chromatography, such as, e.g., on an anti-Factor VII antibody column (see, e.g.,\n Wakabayashi et al., J. Biol. Chem. 261:11097, 1986\n; and \nThim et al., Biochem. 27:7785, 1988\n); hydrophobic interaction chromatography; ion-exchange chromatography; size exclusion chromatography; electrophoretic procedures (e.g., preparative isoelectric focusing (IEF), differential solubility (e.g., ammonium sulfate precipitation), or extraction and the like. See, generally, \nScopes, Protein Purification, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1982\n; and \nProtein Purification, J.-C. Janson and Lars Ryden, editors, VCH Publishers, New York, 1989\n. Following purification, the preparation preferably contains less than about 10% by weight, more preferably less than about 5% and most preferably less than about 1%, of non-Factor VII proteins derived from the host cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFactor VII and Factor VII-related polypeptides may be activated by proteolytic cleavage, using Factor Xlla or other proteases having trypsin-like specificity, such as, e.g., Factor IXa, kallikrein, Factor Xa, and thrombin. See, e.g., \nOsterud et al., Biochem. 11:2853 (1972\n); Thomas, \n \nU.S. Patent No. 4,456,591\n \n; and \nHedner et al., J. Clin. Invest. 71:1836 (1983\n). Alternatively, Factor VII may be activated by passing it through an ion-exchange chromatography column, such as Mono Q® (Pharmacia) or the like. The resulting activated Factor VII may then be formulated and administered as described below.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFunctional Properties of Factor VII Preparations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe preparations of Factor VII polypeptides having predetermined oligosaccharide patterns according to the invention exhibit improved functional properties relative to reference preparations. The improved functional properties may include, without limitation, a) physical properties such as, e.g., storage stability; b) pharmacokinetic properties such as, e.g., bioavailability and half-life; and c) immunogenicity in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA reference preparation refers to a preparation comprising a polypeptide that is identical to that contained in the preparation of the invention to which it is being compared (such as, e.g., wild-type Factor VII or a particular variant or chemically modified form) except for exhibiting a different pattern of asparagine-linked glycosylation. For example, reference preparations typically comprise one or more of the following glycoform patterns: (i) less than about 93% (such as, e.g. less than about 92% or less than about 90%) of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one sialic acid residue; (ii) at least about 6% (such as, e.g., at least about 7.5% or at least about 10%) of the oligosaccharide chains lack any sialic acid (i.e., are neutral); (iii) at least about 10% (such as, e.g., at least about 12.5% or at least about 15%) of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one terminal galactose residue; (iv) at least about 15% (such as, e.g., at least about 20% or at least about 25%) of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; (v) at least about 25% (such as, e.g., at least about 30% or at least about 35%) of the oligosaccharide chains contain at least one uncapped antenna (i.e., contain at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue); or (vi) essentially undetectable levels (such as, e.g., less than about 0.2%) of antennary fucose residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStorage stability of a Factor VII preparation may be assessed by measuring (a) the time required for 20% of the bioactivity of a preparation to decay when stored as a dry powder at 25°C and/or (b) the time required for a doubling in the proportion of Factor VIIa aggregates in the preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the preparations of the invention exhibit an increase of at least about 30%, preferably at least about 60% and more preferably at least about 100%, in the time required for 20% of the bioactivity to decay relative to the time required for the same phenomenon in a reference preparation, when both preparations are stored as dry powders at 25°C. Bioactivity measurements may be performed using any of a clotting assay, proteolysis assay, TF-binding assay, or TF-independent thrombin generation assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the preparations of the invention exhibit an increase of at least about 30%, preferably at least about 60%, and more preferably at least about 100%, in the time required for doubling of aggregates relative to a reference preparation, when both preparations are stored as dry powders at 25°C. The content of aggregates is determined by gel permeation HPLC on a Protein Pak 300 SW column (7.5 x 300 mm) (Waters, 80013) as follows. The column is equilibrated with Eluent A (0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 5 % isopropanol, pH adjusted to 2.5 with phosphoric acid, and thereafter pH is adjusted to 7.0 with triethylamine), after which 25 µg of sample is applied to the column. Elution is with Eluent A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 30 min, and detection is achieved by measuring absorbance at 215 nm. The content of aggregates is calculated as the peak area of the Factor VII aggregates/total area of Factor VII peaks (monomer and aggregates).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Bioavailability\" refers to the proportion of an administered dose of a Factor VII or Factor VII-related preparation that can be detected in plasma at predetermined times after administration. Typically, bioavailability is measured in test animals by administering a dose of between about 25-250 µg/kg of the preparation; obtaining plasma samples at predetermined times after administration; and determining the content of Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides in the samples using one or more of a clotting assay (or any bioassay), an immunoassay, or an equivalent. The data are typically displayed graphically as [Factor VII] v. time and the bioavailability is expressed as the area under the curve (AUC). Relative bioavailability of a test preparation refers to the ratio between the AUC of the test preparation and that of the reference preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the preparations of the present invention exhibit a relative bioavailability of at least about 110%, preferably at least about 120%, more preferably at least about 130% and most preferably at least about 140% of the bioavailability of a reference preparation. The bioavailability may be measured in any mammalian species, preferably dogs, and the predetermined times used for calculating AUC may encompass different increments from 10 min- 8 h.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Half-life\" refers to the time required for the plasma concentration of Factor VII polypeptides of Factor VII-related polypeptides to decrease from a particular value to half of that value. Half-life may be determined using the same procedure as for bioavailability. In some embodiments, the preparations of the present invention exhibit an increase in half-life of at least about 0.25 h, preferably at least about 0.5 h, more preferably at least about 1 h, and most preferably at least about 2 h, relative to the half-life of a reference preparation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Immunogenicity\" of a preparation refers to the ability of the preparation, when administered to a human, to elicit a deleterious immune response, whether humoral, cellular, or both. Factor VIIa polypeptides and Factor VIIa-related polypeptides are not known to elicit detectable immune responses in humans. Nonetheless, in any human sub-population, there may exist individuals who exhibit sensitivity to particular administered proteins. Immunogenicity may be measured by quantifying the presence of anti-Factor VII antibodies and/or Factor VII-responsive T-cells in a sensitive individual, using conventional methods known in the art. In some embodiments, the preparations of the present invention exhibit a decrease in immunogenicity in a sensitive individual of at least about 10%, preferably at least about 25%, more preferably at least about 40% and most preferably at least about 50%, relative to the immunogenicity for that individual of a reference preparation.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe preparations of the present invention may be used to treat any Factor VII-responsive syndrome, such as, e.g., bleeding disorders, including, without limitation, those caused by clotting factor deficiencies (e.g., haemophilia A and B or deficiency of coagulation factors XI or VII); by thrombocytopenia or von Willebrand's disease, or by clotting factor inhibitors, or excessive bleeding from any cause. The preparations may also be administered to patients in association with surgery or other trauma or to patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparations comprising Factor VII-related polypeptides according to the invention, which have substantially reduced bioactivity relative to wild-type Factor VII, may be used as anticoagulants, such as, e.g., in patients undergoing angioplasty or other surgical procedures that may increase the risk of thrombosis or occlusion of blood vessels as occurs, e.g., in restenosis. Other medical indications for which anticoagulants are prescribed include, without limitation, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), fibrin deposition in lungs and kidneys associated with gram-negative endotoxemia, myocardial infarction; Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), MOF, and TTP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions comprising the Factor VII and Factor VII-related preparations according to the present are primarily intended for parenteral administration for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment. Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered parenterally, i.e., intravenously, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly. They may be administered by continuous or pulsatile infusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions or formulations comprise a preparation according to the invention in combination with, preferably dissolved in, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, preferably an aqueous carrier or diluent. A variety of aqueous carriers may be used, such as water, buffered water, 0.4% saline, 0.3% glycine and the like. The preparations of the invention can also be formulated into liposome preparations for delivery or targeting to the sites of injury. Liposome preparations are generally described in, e.g., \n \nU.S. Patents Nos. 4,837,028\n \n, \n \n4,501,728\n \n, and \n \n4,975,282\n \n. The compositions may be sterilised by conventional, well-known sterilisation techniques. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use or filtered under aseptic conditions and lyophilised, the lyophilised preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous solution prior to administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may contain pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances or adjuvants, including, without limitation, pH adjusting and buffering agents and/or tonicity adjusting agents, such as, for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe concentration of Factor VII or Factor VII-related polypeptides in these formulations can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.5% by weight, usually at or at least about 1% by weight to as much as 15 or 20% by weight and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, a typical pharmaceutical composition for intravenous infusion could be made up to contain 250 ml of sterile Ringer's solution and 10 mg of the preparation. Actual methods for preparing parenterally administrable compositions will be known or apparent to those skilled in the art and are described in more detail in, for example, \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA (1990\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions containing the preparations of the present invention can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a subject already suffering from a disease, as described above, in an amount sufficient to cure, alleviate or partially arrest the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as \"therapeutically effective amount\". Effective amounts for each purpose will depend on the severity of the disease or injury as well as the weight and general state of the subject. In general, however, the effective amount will range from about 0.05 mg up to about 500 mg of the preparation per day for a 70 kg subject, with dosages of from about 1.0 mg to about 200 mg of the preparation per day being more commonly used. It will be understood that determining an appropriate dosage may be achieved using routine experimentation, by constructing a matrix of values and testing different points in the matrix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLocal delivery of the preparations of the present invention, such as, for example, topical application, may be carried out, e.g., by means of a spray, perfusion, double balloon catheters, stent, incorporated into vascular grafts or stents, hydrogels used to coat balloon catheters, or other well established methods. In any event, the pharmaceutical compositions should provide a quantity of the preparation sufficient to effectively treat the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may further comprise other bioactive agents, such as, e.g., non-Factor VII-related coagulants or anticoagulants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are intended as non-limiting illustrations of the present invention.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nExample 1: Production and Analysis of a Factor VII preparation exhibiting an altered glycoform pattern\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following experiment was performed to produce a Factor VII preparation having an altered glycoform pattern.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nI. \nProduction\n: A BHK cell line transformed with a Factor VII-encoding plasmid was adapted to growth in suspension culture in the absence of serum. The cells were propagated sequentially in spinner cultures and as the cell number increased, the volume was gradually increased by addition of new medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, 6 l of seed culture were inoculated into a 100-liter production bioreactor containing macroporous Cytopore 1 carriers (Pharmacia), after which the suspension cells became immobilized in the carriers. The culture was maintained at 36°C at a pH of 6.7-6.9 and a DO of 50%. The volume in the production bioreactor was gradually increased by addition of new medium as the cell number increased. When the cell density reached approximately 2 x 10\n6\n cells/ml, the production phase was initiated and a medium change was performed every 24 hours: Agitation was stopped to allow for sedimentation of the cell-containing carriers, and 80% of the culture supernatant was then harvested and replaced with new medium. The harvested culture supernatant was filtered to remove non-trapped cells and cell debris and was then transferred for further processing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring the production phase the cells reached 3-6 x 10\n6\n cells/ml and a titer of 2-7 mg Factor VII/liter.\n\n\n \nII. \n \nAnalysis of the glycoform pattern of recombinant Factor VII\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe oligosaccharide patterns of the following preparations were compared: (a) recombinant Factor VII preparations produced as described in part I (n=7); and two reference preparations: (b) recombinant Factor VII preparations produced in BHK cells in the presence of calf serum (n=10); and (c) a Factor VII preparation purified from human plasma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe N-linked oligosaccharides were released from the polypeptides by chemical cleavage (hydrazinolysis, on a GlycoPrep1000 unit, Oxford GlycoSciences) or by enzymatic cleavage (N-glycosidase F from, eg., Boehringer Mannheim). The released oligosaccharides were labeled with 2-aminobenzamide (using a signal labelling kit, K-404, Oxford GlycoSciences or Glyko). The labeled oligosaccharides were analysed using anion-exchange HPLC on a CarboPac PA100 column (4x250 mm, Dionex, P/N 43055) with a Guard column (4x50 mm, Dionex, P/N 43054). The column was equilibrated with 150 mM sodium hydroxide and eluted with a gradient of 0-150 mM sodium acetate, 150 mM sodium hydroxide. Oligosaccharides were detected using fluorescence, with excitation at 330 nm and emission at 420 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe relative contents of the various Factor VII oligosaccharide structures (Klausen et al., 1998) were calculated as the relative peak areas for the carbohydrate peaks in the anion-exchange HPLC analysis. Based on the structural elements of each oligosaccharide, it was assigned to one of the following: (i) chains containing at least one sialic acid; (ii) chains lacking any sialic acid (i.e., neutral); (iii) chains containing at least one terminal galactose residue; (iv) chains containing at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; and (v) chains containing at least one uncapped antenna (i.e., at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue). Finally, the sum of the relative contents of the oligosaccharide chains assigned to each group was calculated as a percentage of the total oligosaccharide chains. The standard deviation of this determination was calculated to be 0.08% (intraday variation); 0.7% (day-to-day variation); and 0.5% (1-100 µg interval).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting glycoform patterns are illustrated in the following table:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(i)\n \n \n \n(ii)\n \n \n \n(iii)\n \n \n \n(iv)\n \n \n \n(v)\n \n \n \n \n \n \na\n \n \n93.1-98.7\n \n1.3-6.9\n \n5.9-16.4\n \n5.9-8.7\n \n11.7-23.9\n \n \n \n \nb\n \n \n88.3-92.5\n \n7.5-12.9\n \n9.4-16.8\n \n19.0-28.6\n \n30.1-39.0\n \n \n \n \nc\n \n \n99.5%\n \n<0.5%\n \n2-3%\n \n0%\n \n2-3%\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nThe recombinant Factor VII preparations produced according to this Example (i.e., in the absence of serum) exhibit a glycoform pattern that differs from both the glycoform pattern of recombinant Factor VII produced in the presence of serum and native Factor VII isolated from human plasma. The oligosaccharides of recombinant Factor VII produced in the absence of serum are sialylated to a higher extent than those produced in the presence of serum and contain less neutral chains and less chains that terminate in either galactose or N-acetylgalatosamine.\n\n\n\n\n \nIII. \nBioavailability:\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe following experiment was performed to compare the bioavailability of two Factor VII preparations produced as above (I and II) with that of two reference Factor VII preparations (i.e., produced in the presence of serum) (A and B).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGroups of 8 rats were administered either a test preparation or a reference preparation at a dose of 25 µg/kg (≈ 100 µg/rat) in a glycylglycine buffer (pH 7.4) containing sodium chloride (7.87 mg/ml), calcium chloride dihydrate (1.48 mg/ml), mannitol (2.5 mg/ml) and polysorbate 80. Blood samples were withdrawn at 10 min and 30 min following the initial administration. Plasma was obtained from the samples and Factor VII was quantified by ELISA. Bioavailability of each sample is expressed as the dose-adjusted area under the plasma concentration curve for Factor VII based on the 10 and 30-min samples (AUC\n10-30\ndose).

A 10% increase in the % sialylation, moreover, causes a 40-50% increase in bioavailability.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 2: \nAnalysis of Factor VII preparations exhibiting an altered glycoform pattern\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nFactor VII was produced as described in Example 1 above, with the exception that the Factor VII was harvested from 500-I cultures.

All animals received each of the three test preparations A, B, and C and the reference preparation D at a dose of ≈90 µg/kg in a glycylglycine buffer (pH 5.5) containing sodium chloride (2.92 mg/ml), calcium chloride dihydrate (1.47 mg/ml), mannitol (30 mg/ml) and polysorbate 80.

FEBS Lett. 385: 241-243\n). Briefly, it carries the cDNA nucleotide sequence encoding human FVII including the propeptide under the control of a mouse metallothionein promoter for transcription of the inserted cDNA, and mouse dihydrofolate reductase cDNA under the control of an SV40 early promoter for use as a selectable marker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor construction of a plasmid vector encoding a gamma-carboxylation recognition sequence, a cloning vector (pBluescript II KS+, Stratagene) containing cDNA encoding FVII including its propeptide was used (pLN171). (\nPersson et al. 1997. J. Biol. Chem. 272: 19919-19924\n). A nucleotide sequence encoding a stop codon was inserted into the cDNA encoding FVII after the propeptide of FVII by inverse PCR-mediated mutagenesis using this cloning vector. The template plasmid was denatured by treatment with NaOH followed by PCR with Pwo (Boehringer-Mannheim) and Taq (Perkin-Elmer) polymerases with the following primers:\n\n \n \n \na) 5'-AGC GTT TTA GCG CCG GCG CCG GTG CAG GAC-3'\n \nb) 5'-CGC CGG CGC TAA AAC GCT TTC CTG GAG GAG CTG CGG CC-3'\n \n\n\n \n \n \nThe resulting mix was digested with Dpnl to digest residual template DNA and \nEscherichia coli\n were transformed with the PCR product. Clones were screened for the presence of the mutation by sequencing. The cDNA from a correct clone was transferred as a BamHI-EcoRI fragment to the expression plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was termed pLN329. CHO K1 cells (ATCC CCI61) were transfected with equal amounts of pLN174 and pLN329 with the Fugene6 method (Boehriner-Mannheim). Transfectants were selected by the addition of methotrexate to 1µM and G-418 to 0.45 mg/ml. The pool of transfectants were cloned by limiting dilution and FVII expression from the clones was measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA high producing clone was further subcloned and a clone E11 with a specific FVII expression of 2.4 pg/cell/day in Dulbecco-modified Eagle's medium with 10 % fetal calf serum was selected. The clone was adapted to serum free suspension culture in a commercially available CHO medium (JRH Bioscience) free of animal derived components.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe adapted cells were propagated sequentially in spinner cultures and as the cell number increased, the volume was gradually increased by addition of new medium. After 25 days, 6 I of spinner culture were inoculated into a 50-liter bioreactor. The cells were propagated in the bioreactor and as the cell number increased, the volume was gradually increased by addition of new medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, 50 I of seed culture were inoculated into a 500-liter production bioreactor containing macroporous Cytopore 1 carriers (Pharmacia), after which the suspension cells became immobilized in the carriers. The culture was maintained at 36°C at a pH of 7.0-7.1 and a Dissolved Oxygen Tension (DOT) of 50% of saturation. The volume in the bioreactor was gradually increased by addition of new medium as the cell number increased. When the cell density reached approximately 10-12 x 105 cells/ml, the production phase was initiated and a medium change was performed every 24 hours: agitation was stopped to allow for sedimentation of the cell-containing carriers, and 80% of the culture supernatant was then harvested and replaced with new medium. The harvested culture supernatant was filtered to remove non-trapped cells (i.e. cells that were not immobilized in carriers) and cell debris and was then transferred for further processing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDuring the production phase the cells reached 2-3 x 107 cells/ml and a titer of 8 mg Factor VII/liter.\n\n\n \nII. \nGlycoform Analysis\n:\n\n\n \n \n \nA. The oligosaccharide pattern of a Factor VII preparation produced as described above (a) was compared with those of (b) recombinant Factor VII preparations produced in BHK cells in the presence of calf serum and (c) a Factor VII preparation purified from human plasma. The methods used were essentially as described in Example 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results are shown in the Table below. The oligosaccharide assignments are as follows: (i) chains containing at least one sialic acid; (ii) chains lacking any sialic acid (i.e., neutral); (iii) chains containing at least one terminal galactose residue; (iv) chains containing at least one terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residue; and (v) chains containing at least one uncapped antenna (i.e., at least one terminal galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residue).\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(i)\n \n \n \n(ii)\n \n \n \n(iii)\n \n \n \n(iv)\n \n \n \n(v)\n \n \n \n \n \n \na\n \n \n95.2\n \n4.8\n \n22.9\n \n0.1\n \n23.0\n \n \n \n \nb\n \n \n88.3-92.5\n \n7.5-12.9\n \n9.4-16.8\n \n19.0-28.6\n \n30.1-39.0\n \n \n \n \nc\n \n \n99.5%\n \n<0.5%\n \n2-3%\n \n0%\n \n2-3%\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nB. The oligosaccharide patterns of five independent Factor VII preparations produced as described in this Example (a) were compared with those of (b) recombinant Factor VII preparations produced in BHK cells in the presence of calf serum and (c) a Factor VII preparation purified from human plasma, using the analytical methods described in Example 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the structural elements of each oligosaccharide, it was assigned to one of the following: (i) chains containing at least one sialic acid; (ii) chains lacking any sialic acid (i.e., neutral); (iii) chains containing at least one fucose linked to the antenna. Finally, the sum of the relative contents of the oligosaccharide chains assigned to each group was calculated as a percentage of the total oligosaccharide chains. The standard deviation of this determination was calculated to be 0.08% (intraday variation); 0.7% (day-to-day variation); and 0.5% (1-100 µg interval).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe resulting glycoform patterns are illustrated in the following Table:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(i)\n \n(ii)\n \n(iii)\n \n \n \n \na\n \n89.0-97.9%\n \n2.1-11.0%\n \n6.3-21.3%\n \n \n \nb\n \n88.3-92.5%\n \n7.5-12.9%\n \n0%\n \n \n \nc\n \n99.5%\n \n<0.5%\n \n0%\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe recombinant Factor VII preparations produced according to Example 1 (i.e., produced in the absence of serum by the CHO cell line) exhibit a glycoform pattern that differs from both the glycoform pattern of recombinant Factor VII produced in the presence of serum and native Factor VII isolated from human plasma. The oligosaccharides of recombinant Factor VII produced in the absence of serum by the CHO 282.4 cell line include structures with fucose linked to the antenna, which are absent from both of the reference preparations. Two of the structures have been purified and characterized by matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry, by treatment with linkage specific fucosidase enzymes and by anion-exchange HPLC as described above. The two structures have been shown to contain the sialyl Lewis x structure, i.e., fucose linked α1->3 to an antennary N-acetylglucosamine in a sialylated oligosaccharide.\n\n\n \nIII. \nBioactivity\n:\n\n\n \n \n \nFive Factor VII preparations produced as described in this Example were analyzed for (a) thrombin generation and (b) binding to tissue factor (TF) and compared with recombinant Factor VII produced in BHK cells in the presence of serum (reference). The following Table correlates the glycoform patterns (% of oligosaccharide chains containing sialic acid and the % containing fucosylated antenna) and the two bioactivities.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFactor VII Preparation\n \nOligosaccharide Pattern\n \nThrombin generation (% of reference)\n \nTF binding Kd (nM)\n \n \n \n% Sialyl\n \n%Fucosyl\n \n \n \n \n1\n \n98\n \n6\n \n125\n \n2.8\n \n \n \n2\n \n94\n \n13\n \n123\n \n2.0\n \n \n \n3\n \n93\n \n14\n \n126\n \n1.8\n \n \n \n4\n \n88\n \n16\n \n145\n \n3.3\n \n \n \n5\n \n86\n \n21\n \n158\n \n2.8\n \n \n \nreference\n \n86-93\n \n0\n \n100\n \n2.2-6.6\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results indicate that Factor VII preparations having fucosylated antennae exhibit higher TF-independent Factor VII activity (as exhibited, e.g. by thrombin generation) than Factor VII preparations lacking fucosylated antennae.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 4: \n \nIn Vitro\n Hydrolysis Assay\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following method can be used to assay Factor VIIa bioactivity. The assay is carried out in a microtiter plate (MaxiSorp, Nunc, Denmark). The chromogenic substrate D-Ile-Pro-Arg-\np\n-nitroanilide (S-2288, Chromogenix, Sweden), at a final concentration of 1 mM, is added to Factor VIIa (final concentration 100 nM) in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl\n2\n and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The absorbance at 405 nm is measured continuously in a SpectraMax™ 340 plate reader (Molecular Devices, USA). The absorbance developed during a 20-minute incubation, after subtraction of the absorbance in a blank well containing no enzyme, is used to calculate the ratio between the activities of a test and a reference Factor VIIa.\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 5: \n \nIn Vitro\n Proteolysis Assay\n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following method can be used to assay Factor VIIa bioactivity. The assay is carried out in a microtiter plate (MaxiSorp, Nunc, Denmark). Factor VIIa (10 nM) and Factor X (0.8 microM) in 100 µl 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 M NaCl, 5 mM CaCl\n2\n and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, are incubated for 15 min. Factor X cleavage is then stopped by the addition of 50µl 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The amount of Factor Xa generated is measured by addition of the chromogenic substrate Z-D-Arg-Gly-Arg-\np\n-nitroanilide (S-2765, Chromogenix, Sweden), final concentration 0.5 mM. The absorbance at 405 nm is measured continuously in a SpectraMax™ 340 plate reader (Molecular Devices, USA). The absorbance developed during 10 minutes, after subtraction of the absorbance in a blank well containing no FVIIa, is used to calculate the ratio between the proteolytic activities of a test and a reference Factor VIIa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll patents, patent applications, and literature references referred to herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany variations of the present invention will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art in light of the above detailed description.
