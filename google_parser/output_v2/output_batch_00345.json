Description\n\n\n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\n\nThis application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/930,186, filed May 15, 2007, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nFIELD\n\n\nThe present invention relates to aminoazacyclyl-3-sulfonylindazole compounds, compositions containing these compounds, and methods of their use in the treatment of central nervous system disorders related to or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor. One potential therapeutic use of modulators of 5-HT6 receptor function is in the enhancement of cognition and memory in human diseases such as Alzheimer's.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nSerotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine)(5-HT) receptors play a critical role in many physiological and behavioral functions in humans and animals. These functions are mediated through various 5-HT receptors distributed throughout the body. There are now approximately fifteen different human 5-HT receptor subtypes that have been cloned, many with well-defined roles in humans. One of the most recently identified 5-HT receptor subtypes is the 5-HT6 receptor, first cloned from rat tissue in 1993 (Monsma, F. J.; Shen, Y.; Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W. \nMolecular Pharmacology \n1993, 43, 320-327) and subsequently from human tissue (Kohen, R.; Metcalf, M. A.; Khan, N.; Druck, T.; Huebner, K.; Sibley, D. R. \nJournal of Neurochemistry \n1996, 66, 47-56). The receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) positively coupled to adenylate cyclase (Ruat, M.; Traiffort, E.; Arrang, J-M.; Tardivel-Lacombe, L.; Diaz, L.; Leurs, R.; Schwartz, J-C. \nBiochemical Biophysical Research Communications \n1993, 193, 268-276). The receptor is found almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS) areas both in rat and in human. In situ hybridization studies of the 5-HT6 receptor in rat brain using mRNA indicate principal localization in the areas of 5-HT projection including striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and hippocampal formation (Ward, R.

M. \nNeuroscience \n1995, 64, 1105-1111).\n\n\nThere are many potential therapeutic uses for 5-HT6 ligands in humans based on direct effects and on indications from available scientific studies. These studies include the localization of the receptor, the affinity of ligands with known in vivo activity, and various animal studies conducted so far.\n\n\nThe high levels of receptor found in important structures in the forebrain, including the caudate/putamen, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and cortex suggest a role for the receptor in memory and cognition since these areas are known to play a vital role in memory (Gerard, C.; Martres, M.-P.; Lefevre, K.; Miquel, M. C.; Verge, D.; Lanfumey, R.; Doucet, E.; Hamon, M.; E I Mestikawy, S. \nBrain Research, \n1997, 746, 207-219). The ability of known 5-HT6 receptor ligands to enhance cholinergic transmission also supported the potential cognition use (Bentley, J. C.; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J. \nBritish Journal of Pharmacology, \n1999, 126(7), 1537-1542). Studies have found that a known 5-HT6 selective antagonist significantly increased glutamate and aspartate levels in the frontal cortex without elevating levels of noradrenaline, dopamine, or 5-HT. This selective elevation of neurochemicals known to be involved in memory and cognition strongly suggests a role for 5-HT6 ligands in cognition (Dawson, L. A.; Nguyen, H. Q.; Li, P. \nBritish Journal of Pharmacology, \n2000, 130(1), 23-26). Animal studies of memory and learning with a known selective 5-HT6 antagonist found some positive effects (Rogers, D. C.; Hatcher, P. D.; Hagan, J. J. \nSociety of Neuroscience, Abstracts \n2000, 26, 680). Further support for the role of a selective 5-HT6 ligand in cognition can be found in Woolley, M. L.; Marsden, C. A.; Sleight, A. J.; and Fone, K. C. F., \nPsychopharmacology, \n2003, 170(4), 358-367.\n\n\nA related potential therapeutic use for 5-HT6 ligands is the treatment of attention deficit disorders (ADD, also known as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD) in both children and adults. Because 5-HT6 antagonists appear to enhance the activity of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and because ADHD has been linked to abnormalities in the caudate (Ernst, M; Zametkin, A. J.; Matochik, j. H.; Jons, P. A.; Cohen, R. M. \nJournal of Neuroscience \n1998, 18(15), 5901-5907), 5-HT6 antagonists may attenuate attention deficit disorders.\n\n\nEarly studies examining the affinity of various CNS ligands with known therapeutic utility or a strong structural resemblance to known drugs suggests a role for 5-HT6 ligands in the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. For example, clozapine (an effective clinical antipsychotic) has high affinity for the 5-HT6 receptor subtype. Also, several clinical antidepressants have high affinity for the receptor as well and act as antagonists at this site (Branchek, T. A.; Blackburn, T. P. \nAnnual Reviews in Pharmacology and Toxicology \n2000, 40, 319-334).\n\n\nFurther, recent in vivo studies in rats indicate 5-HT6 modulators may be useful in the treatment of movement disorders including epilepsy (Stean, T.; Routledge, C.; Upton, N. \nBritish Journal of Pharmacology \n1999, 127 Proc. Supplement 131P and Routledge, C.; Bromidge, S. M.; Moss, S. F.; Price, G. W.; Hirst, W.; Newman, H.; Riley, G.; Gager, T.; Stean, T.; Upton, N.; Clarke, S. E.; Brown, A. M. \nBritish Journal of Pharmacology \n2000, 130(7), 1606-1612).\n\n\nTaken together, the above studies strongly suggest that compounds which are 5-HT6 receptor modulators, i.e. ligands, may be useful for therapeutic indications including: the treatment of diseases associated with a deficit in memory, cognition, and learning such as Alzheimer's and attention deficit disorder; the treatment of personality disorders such as schizophrenia; the treatment of behavioral disorders, e.g., anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorders; the treatment of motion or motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy; the treatment of diseases associated with neurodegeneration such as stroke and head trauma; or withdrawal from drug addiction including addiction to nicotine, alcohol, and other substances of abuse.\n\n\nTherefore, it is an object of this invention to provide compounds which are useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of a variety of central nervous system disorders related to or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor.\n\n\nIt is another object of this invention to provide therapeutic methods and pharmaceutical compositions useful for the treatment of central nervous system disorders related to or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor.\n\n\nIt is a feature of this invention that the compounds provided may also be used to further study and elucidate the 5-HT6 receptor.\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nThe present invention provides a compound of formula I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1 \nis H, halogen, CN, COR\n9\n, OCO\n2\nR\n10\n, CO\n2\nR\n11\n, CONR\n12\nR\n13\n, SO\np\nR\n14\n, NR\n15\nR\n16\n, OR\n17 \nor a C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n7\ncycloalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl group each optionally substituted;\n \nR\n2 \nis an optionally substituted aryl, or optionally substituted heteroaryl group or an optionally substituted 8- to 13-membered bicyclic or tricyclic ring system having a N atom at the bridgehead and optionally containing 1, 2 or 3 additional heteroatoms selected from N, O or S;\n \nR\n3 \nis H or C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl or C\n3\n-C\n7\ncycloalkyl;\n \nR\n4 \nand R\n5 \nare each independently H, C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl or C\n3\n-C\n7\ncycloalkyl or R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nmay be taken together with the atom to which they are attached to form an optionally substituted 3- to 7-membered ring;\n \nm is an integer of 1, 2 or 3;\n \nn is 0 or an integer of 1, 2 or 3;\n \np is 0 or an integer of 1 or 2;\n \nR\n9\n, R\n10\n, R\n11 \nand R\n17 \nare each independently H or a C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\nalkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\nalkynyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\ncycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl group each optionally substituted;\n \nR\n12\n, R\n13\n, R\n15 \nand R\n16 \nare each independently H or an optionally substituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl group or R\n12 \nand R\n13 \nmay be taken together with the atom to which they are attached to form a 5- to 7-membered ring optionally containing another heteroatom selected from O, NR\n18 \nor SO\np \nor R\n15 \nand R\n16 \nmay be taken together with the atom to which they are attached to form a 5- to 7-membered ring optionally containing another heteroatom selected from O, NR\n18 \nor SO\np\n;\n \nR\n14 \nis a C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\nalkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\nalkynyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\ncycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl group each optionally substituted; and\n \nR\n18 \nis H or a C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\nalkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\nalkynyl, C\n3\n-C\n7\ncycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl group each optionally substituted; or\n\n\na stereoisomer thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n \n \n \n\n\nThe present invention also provides methods and compositions useful in the treatment of central nervous system disorders.\n\n\nIn particular, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition, which includes a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; and at least one compound of formula I.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the present invention provides a method of treatment of a central nervous system disorder related to or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor in a patient in need thereof.

Its ability to bind a wide range of therapeutic compounds used in psychiatry, coupled with its intriguing distribution in the brain has stimulated significant interest in new compounds which are capable of interacting with or affecting said receptor. Significant efforts are being made to understand the possible role of the 5-HT6 receptor in psychiatry, cognitive dysfunction, motor function and control, memory, mood and the like. To that end, compounds which demonstrate a binding affinity for the 5-HT6 receptor are earnestly sought both as an aid in the study of the 5-HT6 receptor and as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of central nervous system disorders (for example see C. Reavill and D. C. Rogers, Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2001, 2(1):104-109, Pharma Press Ltd.).\n\n\nSurprisingly, it has now been found that aminoazacyclyl-3-sulfonylindazoles of formula I demonstrate 5-HT6 affinity along with significant 5-HT receptor sub-type selectivity. Advantageously, said formula I indazoles are effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders associated with or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor.

For example, the substituent “arylalkyloxycabonyl” refers to the group (aryl)-(alkyl)-O—C(O)—.\n\n\nIt is understood that in all substituted groups defined above, polymers arrived at by defining substituents with further substituents to themselves (e.g., substituted aryl having a substituted aryl group as a substituent which is itself substituted with a substituted aryl group, which is further substituted by a substituted aryl group etc.) are not intended for inclusion herein. In such cases, the maximum number of such substitutions is three. For example, serial substitutions of substituted aryl groups with two other substituted aryl groups are limited to -substituted aryl-(substituted aryl)-substituted aryl.\n\n\nSimilarly, it is understood that the above definitions are not intended to include impermissible substitution patterns (e.g., methyl substituted with 5 fluoro groups). Such impermissible substitution patterns are well known to the skilled artisan.\n\n\nAt various places in the present specification, substituents of compounds are disclosed in groups or in ranges. It is specifically intended that the description include each and every individual subcombination of the members of such groups and ranges. For example, the term “C\n1-6 \nalkyl” is specifically intended to individually disclose C\n1\n, C\n2\n, C\n3\n, C\n4\n, C\n5\n, C\n6\n, C\n1\n-C\n6\n, C\n1\n-C\n5\n, C\n1\n-C\n4\n, C\n1\n-C\n3\n, C\n1\n-C\n2\n, C\n2\n-C\n6\n, C\n2\n-C\n5\n, C\n2\n-C\n4\n, C\n2\n-C\n3\n, C\n3\n-C\n6\n, C\n3\n-C\n5\n, C\n3\n-C\n4\n, C\n4\n-C\n6\n, C\n4\n-C\n5\n, and C\n5\n-C\n6 \nalkyl. By way of another example, the term “5-7 membered ring” is specifically intended to individually disclose a ring having 5, 6, 7, 5-7, and 5-6 ring atoms.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention include esters, carbamates or other conventional prodrug forms, which in general, are functional derivatives of the compounds of the invention and which are readily converted to the inventive active moiety in vivo. Correspondingly, the method of the invention embraces the treatment of the various conditions described hereinabove with a compound of formula I or with a compound which is not specifically disclosed but which, upon administration, converts to a compound of formula I in vivo. Also included are metabolites of the compounds of the present invention defined as active species produced upon introduction of these compounds into a biological system.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention may exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. One skilled in the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active or may exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when separated from the other stereoisomer(s). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, enrich or selectively prepare said stereoisomers. Accordingly, the present invention comprises compounds of formula I, the stereoisomers thereof and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The compounds of the invention may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers, or as an optically active or enantiomerically pure form.\n\n\nPreferred compounds of the invention are those compounds of formula I wherein R\n1 \nis H. Another group of preferred compounds are those compounds of formula I wherein R\n2 \nis a phenyl or naphthyl group each group optionally substituted. In one preferred embodiment, R\n2 \nis an aryl group, such as a phenyl or naphthyl group, optionally substituted by 0-4 substituents independently selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, chloro, bromo, fluoro, iodo or a combination thereof. A further group of preferred compounds of the invention are those compounds of formula I wherein R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nare independently H or methyl. Also preferred are those compounds of formula I wherein the azacyclic ring is attached to the indazole in the 5 position.\n\n\nMore preferred compounds of the invention are those compounds of formula I wherein R\n1 \nis H; R\n3 \nis H or C\n1 \nto C\n4\nalkyl; and R\n2 \nis a phenyl or naphthyl group each group optionally substituted. Another group of more preferred compounds are those compounds of formula I wherein R\n1 \nis H; R\n3 \nis H or C\n1 \nto C\n4 \nalkyl; R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nare independently H or methyl; R\n2 \nis a phenyl or naphthyl group each group optionally substituted; and the azacyclic ring is attached to the indazole in the 5 position. In one preferred embodiment, the optional substituent present in the phenyl or naphthyl group is a C\n1 \nto C\n4\nalkyl group or halogen.\n\n\nAmong the preferred compounds of the invention are:\n\n \n \n(3R)-1-[3-(1-naphthylsulfonyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl]pyrrolidin-3-amine;\n \n1-[3-(1-naphthylsulfonyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl]piperidin-4-amine;\n \n1-{3-[(4-methyl-1-naphthyl)sulfonyl]-1H-indazol-5-yl}piperidin-4-amine;\n \n1-{3-[(5-chloro-1-naphthyl)sulfonyl]-1H-indazol-5-yl}piperidin-4-amine;\n \n1-{3-[(3-chlorophenyl)sulfonyl]-1H-indazol-5-yl}piperidin-4-amine;\n \n1-[3-(2-naphthylsulfonyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl]piperidin-4-amine;\n \n1-{3-[(4-isopropylphenyl)sulfonyl]-1H-indazol-5-yl}piperidin-4-amine;\n \n1-[3-(1-naphthylsulfonyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl]azetidin-3-amine;\n \n(3S)-1-[3-(1-naphthylsulfonyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl]pyrrolidin-3-amine;\n \n(3S)-1-(3-phenylsulfonyl-1H-indazol-5-yl)pyrrolidin-3-amine;\n \n(3R)-1-(3-phenylsulfonyl-1H-indazol-5-yl)pyrrolidin-3-amine;\n \n(R)—N,N-dimethyl-1-(3-(naphthalen-1-ylsulfonyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)pyrrolidin-3-amine;\n \n(S)—N,N-dimethyl-1-(3-(naphthalen-1-ylsulfonyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)pyrrolidin-3-amine;\n \n1-(3-(phenylsulfonyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)azetidin-3-amine;\n \n(R)-1-(1-methyl-3-(naphthalen-1-ylsulfonyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)pyrrolidin-3-amine;\n \n(R)-1-(1-isopropyl-3-(naphthalen-1-ylsulfonyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)pyrrolidin-3-amine;\n \n(R)-1-(1-isobutyl-3-(naphthalen-1-ylsulfonyl)-1H-indazol-5-yl)pyrrolidin-3-amine;\n\n\na stereoisomer thereof; or\n\n\na pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n \n\n\nIn one embodiment, a compound of the present invention exists as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. More particularly, in one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt is hydrochloride (HCl).\n\n\nCompounds of the invention may be prepared using conventional synthetic methods and, if required, standard separation or isolation techniques. For example, compounds of formula I wherein R\n3\n, R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nare H (Ia) may be prepared by reacting a halonitrobenzene compound of formula II with a chloromethylsulfone of formula III in the presence of strong base, such as KO-t-Bu or KOH, to give the benzylsulfonyl compound of formula IV; reacting said formula IV compound with a protected azacyclylamine of formula V in the presence of a base such as K\n2\nCO\n3 \nto give the compound of formula VI; reacting said formula VI compound with a reducing agent such as Sn, Fe or Zn in the presence of an acid or H\n2 \nin the presence of a palladium catalyst to give the corresponding amine of formula VII; reacting said amine with NaNO\n2 \nin the presence of an acid to give the corresponding protected aminoazacyclyl-3-sulfonylindazole compound; and deprotecting said protected compound to give the desired compound of formula Ia. The reaction is illustrated in flow diagram I wherein Hal represents Cl or F and P represents a protecting group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, compounds of formula VI may be prepared by reacting a halonitrobenzene compound of formula II with a protected azacyclylamine of formula V in the presence of a base such as K\n2\nCO\n3 \nto give the compound of formula VIII and reacting the formula VIII compound with a chloromethylsulfone of formula III in the presence of strong base, such as KO-t-Bu or KOH, to give the desired intermediate compound of formula VI. The reaction is shown in flow diagram II wherein wherein Hal represents Cl or F and P represents a protecting group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtecting groups suitable for use in the reactions shown hereinabove include t-butyloxycarbonyl, benzyl, acetyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, or any conventional group known to protect a basic nitrogen in standard synthetic procedures.\n\n\nThe chloromethylarylsulfone reagent (III) used in Flow diagrams I and II was either purchased from commercial resources or prepared via the chemical route depicted below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds of formula Ia wherein R\n3 \nis other than H and R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nare H (Ib) may be prepared using conventional alkylation/deprotection procedures. For example, compounds of formula I wherein R\n3 \nis other than H and R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nare H (Ib) may be prepared by reacting a protected compound of formula IX with an alkylating agent of formula X in the presence of a base and a solvent optionally in the presence of a phase-transfer agent to give the corresponding protected alkylated compound and deprotecting said protected compound to give the desired compound of formula Ib. The reaction is shown in flow diagram III wherein P is a protecting group as described hereinabove and LG is a leaving group such as Cl, Br, I, OH, B(OH)\n2\n, tosyl, mesyl or the like. Under conditions described in flow diagram III, a byproduct (Ic) from this reaction was isolated and characterized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the processes of preparation described herein, it is contemplated that variables, such as protecting groups, can be modified or substituted in between recited steps, so long as the modified group falls within the claimed genus. For example, in Flow Diagram I, a protecting group P on a compound of formula (VI) may be Cbz, whereas in a later step, the protecting group P at the same position of a compound of formula (VII) may be Boc. In such instances, a 2-step, deprotecting-protecting reaction will occur.\n\n\nThe term “protecting group” with respect to amine groups, hydroxyl groups and sulfhydryl groups refers to forms of these functionalities which are protected from undesirable reaction with a protected group known to those skilled in the art, such as those set forth in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene, T. W.; Wuts, P. G. M., John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y., (3\nrd \nEdition, 1999), the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference, which protecting groups can be added or removed using the procedures set forth therein. Examples of protected hydroxyl groups include, but are not limited to, silyl ethers such as those obtained by reaction of a hydroxyl group with a reagent such as, but not limited to, t-butyldimethyl-chlorosilane, trimethylchlorosilane, triisopropylchlorosilane, triethylchlorosilane; substituted methyl and ethyl ethers such as, but not limited to methoxymethyl ether, methythiomethyl ether, benzyloxymethyl ether, t-butoxymethyl ether, 2-methoxyethoxymethyl ether, tetrahydropyranyl ethers, 1-ethoxyethyl ether, allyl ether, benzyl ether; esters such as, but not limited to, benzoylformate, formate, acetate, trichloroacetate, and trifluoracetate. Examples of protected amine groups include, but are not limited to, amides such as, formamide, acetamide, trifluoroacetamide, and benzamide; carbamates; e.g. Boc; imides, such as phthalimide, Fmoc, Cbz, PMB, benzyl, and dithiosuccinimide; and others. Examples of protected or capped sulfhydryl groups include, but are not limited to, thioethers such as S-benzyl thioether, and S-4-picolyl thioether; substituted S-methyl derivatives such as hemithio, dithio and aminothio acetals; and others.\n\n\nReference to “leaving group” as used herein indicates having an electrophilic moiety bound to a substituent, capable of being displaced by a nucleophile. Examples of preferred leaving groups are halogens, such as F, Cl, Br or I; triflate; mesylate, or tosylate; esters; aldehydes; ketones; epoxides; and the like. An example of a leaving group is propyliodide, which is readily attacked by a nucleophile, such as a 1-indazolyl group to form a propyl-1-indazolyl functionality.\n\n\nThe terms “deprotecting” or “removing the protecting group” refer to removal of a protecting group, such as removal of a benzyl or BOC group bound to an amine. Deprotecting may be performed by heating and/or addition of reagents capable of removing protecting groups. In preferred embodiments, the deprotecting step involves addition of an acid, base, reducing agent, oxidizing agent, heat, or any combination thereof. One preferred method of removing BOC groups from amino groups is to add HCl or TFA to a solution. Many deprotecting reactions are well known in the art and are described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Greene, T. W., John Wiley & Sons, New York, N.Y., (1st Edition, 1981), the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein\n\n \n \n \n \nR\n1 \nis H, halogen, CN, COR\n9\n, OCO\n2\nR\n10\n, CO\n2\nR\n11\n, CONR\n12\nR\n13\n, SO\np\nR\n14\n, NR\n15\nR\n16\n, OR\n17 \nor a C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n7\ncycloalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl group each optionally substituted;\n \nR\n2 \nis an optionally substituted aryl, or optionally substituted heteroaryl group or an optionally substituted 8- to 13-membered bicyclic or tricyclic ring system having a N atom at the bridgehead and optionally containing 1, 2 or 3 additional heteroatoms selected from N, O or S;\n \nR\n3 \nis H or C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl or C\n3\n-C\n7\ncycloalkyl;\n \nR\n4 \nand R\n5 \nare each H;\n \nm is an integer of 1, 2 or 3;\n \nn is 0 or an integer of 1, 2 or 3;\n \np is 0 or an integer of 1 or 2;\n \nR\n9\n, R\n10\n, R\n11 \nand R\n17 \nare each independently H or a C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\nalkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\nalkynyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\ncycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl group each optionally substituted;\n \nR\n12\n, R\n13\n, R\n15 \nand R\n16 \nare each independently H or an optionally substituted C\n1\n-C\n4\nalkyl group or R\n12 \nand R\n13 \nmay be taken together with the atom to which they are attached to form a 5- to 7-membered ring optionally containing another heteroatom selected from O, NR\n18 \nor SO\np \nor R\n15 \nand R\n16 \nmay be taken together with the atom to which they are attached to form a 5- to 7-membered ring optionally containing another heteroatom selected from O, NR\n18 \nor SO\np\n;\n \nR\n14 \nis a C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\nalkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\nalkynyl, C\n3\n-C\n6\ncycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl or heteroaryl group each optionally substituted; and\n \nR\n18 \nis H or a C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\nalkenyl, C\n2\n-C\n6\nalkynyl, C\n3\n-C\n7\ncycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl or\n \n \n \n\n\nheteraryl group each optionally substituted;\n\n\nwhich process comprises (i) or (ii) below:\n\n\n(i) cyclizing a compound of formula (VII):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein, P is a protecting group and R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare as defined hereinabove for formula I to form a compound of formula (IX):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n \n \n \n \ndeprotecting said compound of formula (IX) to give the compound of formula (I), wherein R\n3 \nof formula I is H;\n \n \n \n\n\nor\n\n\n(ii) reacting R\n3\n-LG with a compound of formula (IX):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein R\n3 \nis other than H as described hereinabove, LG is a leaving group, P is a protecting group, and R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare as defined hereinabove for formula I; and thereafter removing the protecting group to give the compound of formula (I) wherein R\n3 \nis other than H as described hereinabove.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the compound of formula (IX) in (ii) above is prepared by: cyclizing the compound of said formula (VII) to form the compound of formula (IX).\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the cyclizing step includes reacting the compound of formula (VII) with sodium nitrate (NaNO\n2\n).\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the cyclizing step is performed in the presence of HCl.\n\n\nIn some embodiments, the compound of formula (VII) is prepared by: reducing a compound of formula (VI):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein, P is a protecting group, and R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare as defined hereinabove for formula I, to form the compound of formula (VII).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the reducing step is performed in the presence of tin chloride (SnCl\n2\n) and HCl.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the reducing step is performed in the presence of H\n2 \nand a palladium catalyst.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the compound of formula (VI) is prepared by: reacting a benzylsulfonyl chloride compound of formula (IV):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein, Hal is a halogen atom and R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare as defined hereinabove for formula I, with a protected azacyclylamine of formula V:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein P is a protecting group,\n\n\nto form the compound of formula (VI).\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the reacting step is performed in the presence of a base.\n\n\nThe compounds prepared by these processes are useful in vitro or in vivo in modulating 5-HT6 activity. In a particular embodiment, modulating refers to inhibiting activity.\n\n\nAdvantageously, the formula I compounds of the invention are useful for the treatment of CNS disorders relating to or affected by 5-HT6 receptor including motor, mood, personality, behavioral, psychiatric, cognitive, neurodegenerative, or the like disorders, for example Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, attention deficit disorder, anxiety, epilepsy, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, sleep disorders, neurodegenerative disorders (such as head trauma or stroke), feeding disorders (such as anorexia or bulimia), schizophrenia, memory loss, disorders associated withdrawal from drug or nicotine abuse, or the like or certain gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for the treatment of a disorder of the central nervous system related to or affected by the 5-HT6 receptor in a patient in need thereof which comprises providing said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I as described hereinabove. The compounds may be provided by oral or parenteral administration or in any common manner known to be an effective administration of a therapeutic agent to a patient in need thereof.\n\n\nThe term “providing” as used herein with respect to providing a compound or substance embraced by the invention, designates either directly administering such a compound or substance, or administering a prodrug, derivative or analog which forms an equivalent amount of the compound or substance within the body.\n\n\nThe therapeutically effective amount provided in the treatment of a specific CNS disorder may vary according to the specific condition(s) being treated, the size, age and response pattern of the patient, the severity of the disorder, the judgment of the attending physician or the like. In general, effective amounts for daily oral administration may be about 0.01 to 1,000 mg/kg, preferably about 0.5 to 500 mg/kg and effective amounts for parenteral administration may be about 0.1 to 100 mg/kg, preferably about 0.5 to 50 mg/kg.\n\n\nIn actual practice, the compounds of the invention are provided by administering the compound or a precursor thereof in a solid or liquid form, either neat or in combination with one or more conventional pharmaceutical carriers or excipients. Accordingly, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and an effective amount of a compound of formula I as described hereinabove.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” means a non-toxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil; sesame oil; olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of the formulator. Other suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are described in “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences,” Mack Pub. Co., New Jersey, 1991, incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may be administered to humans and other animals orally, parenterally, sublingually, by aerosolization or inhalation spray, rectally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, bucally, intrathecally or topically in dosage unit formulations containing conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles as desired. Topical administration may also involve the use of transdermal administration such as transdermal patches or ionophoresis devices. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques.\n\n\nMethods of formulation are well known in the art and are disclosed, for example, in Remington: \nThe Science and Practice of Pharmacy\n, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 19th Edition (1995). Pharmaceutical compositions for use in the present invention can be in the form of sterile, non-pyrogenic liquid solutions or suspensions, coated capsules, suppositories, lyophilized powders, transdermal patches or other forms known in the art.\n\n\nInjectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-propanediol or 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.\n\n\nIn order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form may be accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations may also be prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions, which are compatible with body tissues.\n\n\nSolid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, acetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.\n\n\nSolid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.\n\n\nThe solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.\n\n\nThe active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.\n\n\nSolid carriers suitable for use in the composition of the invention include one or more substances which may also act as flavoring agents, lubricants, solubilizers, suspending agents, fillers, glidants, compression aides, binders, tablet-disintegrating agents or encapsulating materials. In powders, the carrier may be a finely divided solid which is in admixture with a finely divided compound of formula I. In tablets, the formula I compound may be mixed with a carrier having the necessary compression properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. Said powders and tablets may contain up to 99% by weight of the formula I compound. Solid carriers suitable for use in the composition of the invention include calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes and ion exchange resins.\n\n\nLiquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, EtOAc, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.\n\n\nAny pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier suitable for preparing solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups and elixirs may be employed in the composition of the invention. Compounds of formula I may be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier such as water, an organic solvent, or a pharmaceutically acceptable oil or fat, or a mixture thereof. Said liquid composition may contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such as solubilizers, emulsifiers, buffers, preservatives, sweeteners, flavoring agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, coloring agents, viscosity regulators, stabilizers, osmo-regulators, or the like. Examples of liquid carriers suitable for oral and parenteral administration include water (particularly containing additives as above, e.g., cellulose derivatives, preferably sodium carboxymethyl cellulose solution), alcohols (including monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols, e.g., glycols) or their derivatives, or oils (e.g., fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil).

Cultured Hela cells expressing human cloned 5-HT6 receptors are harvested and centrifuged at low speed (1,000×g) for 10.0 min to remove the culture media. The harvested cells are suspended in half volume of fresh physiological phosphate buffered saline solution and recentrifuged at the same speed. This operation is repeated. The collected cells are then homogenized in ten volumes of 50 mM Tris.HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.5 mM EDTA. The homogenate is centrifuged at 40,000×g for 30.0 min and the precipitate is collected. The obtained pellet is resuspended in 10 volumes of Tris.HCl buffer and recentrifuged at the same speed. The final pellet is suspended in a small volume of Tris.HCl buffer and the tissue protein content is determined in aliquots of 10-25 μl volumes. Bovine Serum Albumin is used as the standard in the protein determination according to the method described in Lowry et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n193:265 (1951). The volume of the suspended cell membranes is adjusted to give a tissue protein concentration of 1.0 mg/ml of suspension. The prepared membrane suspension (10 times concentrated) is aliquoted in 1.0 ml volumes and stored at −70° C. until used in subsequent binding experiments.\n\n\nBinding experiments are performed in a 96 well microtiter plate format, in a total volume of 200 μl. To each well is added the following mixture: 80.0 μl of incubation buffer made in 50 mM Tris.HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10.0 mM MgCl\n2 \nand 0.5 mM EDTA and 20 μl of [\n3\nH]-LSD (S.A., 86.0 Ci/mmol, available from Amersham Life Science), 3.0 nM. The dissociation constant, K\nD \nof the [\n3\nH]LSD at the human serotonin 5-HT6 receptor is 2.9 nM, as determined by saturation binding with increasing concentrations of [\n3\nH]LSD. The reaction is initiated by the final addition of 100.0 μl of tissue suspension. Nonspecific binding is measured in the presence of 10.0 μM methiothepin. The test compounds are added in 20.0 μl volume.\n\n\nThe reaction is allowed to proceed in the dark for 120 min at room temperature, at which time, the bound ligand-receptor complex is filtered off on a 96 well unifilter with a Packard Filtermate® 196 Harvester. The bound complex caught on the filter disk is allowed to air dry and the radioactivity is measured in a Packard TopCount® equipped with six photomultiplier detectors, after the addition of 40.0 μl Microscint®-20 scintillant to each shallow well. The unifilter plate is heat-sealed and counted in a PackardTopCount® with a tritium efficiency of 31.0%.\n\n\nSpecific binding to the 5-HT6 receptor is defined as the total radioactivity bound less the amount bound in the presence of 10.0 μM unlabeled methiothepin. Binding in the presence of varying concentrations of test compound is expressed as a percentage of specific binding in the absence of test compound. The results are plotted as log % bound versus log concentration of test compound. Nonlinear regression analysis of data points with a computer assisted program Prism® yields both the IC\n50 \nand the K\ni \nvalues of test compounds with 95% confidence limits.\n\n\nAlternatively, a linear regression line of data points is plotted, from which the IC\n50 \nvalue is determined and the K\ni \nvalue is determined based upon the following equation:\n\n\n\nK\n \ni\n \n=IC\n \n50\n/(1\n+L/K\n \nD\n)\n\n\nwhere L is the concentration of the radioactive ligand used and K\nD \nis the dissociation constant of the ligand for the receptor, both expressed in nM.\n\n\n\nUsing this assay, the Ki values are determined and compared to those values obtained by representative compounds known to demonstrate binding to the 5-HT6 receptor. The data are shown in Table IV, below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE IV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5-HT6 Binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEx.
