No. 61/028,162, filed Feb. 12, 2008. The entire contents of the provisional application are hereby incorporated by reference in the present application.\n\n\n \nGOVERNMENT SUPPORT\n\n\n \n \n \nThe work described herein was carried out, at least in part, using funds from the United States government under contract number HDTRA1-07-C-0082 from the Defense/Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and contract number HHSN26600600012C from the Department of Health and Human Services/NIH/NAIAD. The United States government may therefore have certain rights in the invention.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA), and its use in mediating RNA interference to inhibit the expression of the CD45 gene and the use of the dsRNA to treat infectious diseases and autoimmune disease.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nCD45 is a hematopoietic cell-specific transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase essential for T and B cell antigen receptor-mediated signaling and also plays a important role in cytokine receptor signaling, chemokine and cytokine response and apoptosis regulation in multiple different leukocyte cell subsets (T cells, B cells, NK cells, myeloid cells, granulocytes, and dendritic cells). CD45 constitutes nearly 10% of T and B cell surface protein. The protein includes a large extracellular domain, and a phosphatase containing cytosolic domain. CD45 may act as both a positive and negative regulator depending on the nature of the stimulus and the cell type involved. CD45 RNA transcripts are alternatively spliced at the N-terminus, which results in extracellular domains of various sizes. The protein controls the activity of Src-family kinases, which if left unregulated, can cause cancer and autoimmunity. Mice and humans lacking CD45 expression have been shown to be immunodeficient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMultiple human or rodent mutations that result in altered CD45 expression or functional activity are associated with distinct malignancies, including autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, overt activation of T cells, susceptibility to infection, type I or type II associated immune disorders, and haemotologic malignancies (reviewed in Tchilian and Beverly, Trends in Immunology, 2006).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDouble-stranded RNA molecules (dsRNA) have been shown to block gene expression in a highly conserved regulatory mechanism known as RNA interference (RNAi). WO 99/32619 (Fire et al.) discloses the use of a dsRNA of at least 25 nucleotides in length to inhibit the expression of the unc-22 gene in \nC. elegans\n. dsRNA has also been shown to degrade target RNA in other organisms, including plants (see, e.g., WO 99/53050, Waterhouse et al.; and WO 99/61631, Heifetz et al.), \nDrosophila \n(see, e.g., Yang, D., et al., \nCurr. Biol\n. (2000) 10:1191-1200), and mammals (see WO 00/44895, Limmer; and DE 101 00 586.5, Kreutzer et al.).\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA), as well as compositions and methods for inhibiting the expression of the CD45 gene in a cell or mammal using such dsRNA. The invention also provides compositions and methods for treating pathological conditions and diseases caused by the expression of the CD45 gene, such as infectious disease and autoimmune disease. The dsRNA featured in the invention includes an RNA strand (the antisense strand) having a region which is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and which is substantially complementary or fully complementary to the corresponding region of an mRNA transcript of the CD45 gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention features, double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) molecules for inhibiting the expression of the CD45 gene.

In some embodiments, the dsRNA is from about 10 to about 15 nucleotides, and in other embodiments the dsRNA is from about 25 to about 30 nucleotides in length. In another embodiment, the dsRNA is at least 15 nucleotides in length.

In one embodiment, the CD45 dsRNA is formulated in a stable nucleic acid particle (SNALP).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNA molecules featured in the invention include dsRNAs that cleave a CD45 mRNA in a target sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs:97-144.

Alternatively, the modified nucleotide may be chosen from the group of: a 2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro modified nucleotide, a 2′-deoxy-modified nucleotide, a locked nucleotide, an abasic nucleotide, 2′-amino-modified nucleotide, 2′-alkyl-modified nucleotide, morpholino nucleotide, a phosphoramidate, and a non-natural base comprising nucleotide. Generally, the first sequence of the dsRNA is selected from the group consisting of the sense sequences of Tables 2, 4 and 5, and the second sequence is selected from the group consisting of the antisense sequences of Tables 2, 4 and 5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides a cell including a dsRNA targeting CD45.

The invention also provides compositions and methods for treating pathological conditions and diseases in a mammal caused by the expression of the CD45 gene using dsRNA. dsRNA directs the sequence-specific degradation of mRNA through a process known as RNA interference (RNAi). The process occurs in a wide variety of organisms, including mammals and other vertebrates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNAs featured in the invention includes an RNA strand (the antisense strand) having a region which is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and is substantially or fully complementary to at least part of an mRNA transcript of the CD45 gene. The use of these dsRNAs enables the targeted degradation of mRNAs of genes that are implicated in autoimmunity and infectious disease in mammals. Using cell-based and animal assays, the present inventors have demonstrated that very low dosages of these dsRNA can specifically and efficiently mediate RNAi, resulting in significant inhibition of expression of the CD45 gene. Thus, the methods and compositions featured in the invention including these dsRNAs are useful for treating autoimmunity and infectious disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following detailed description discloses how to make and use the dsRNA and compositions containing dsRNA to inhibit the expression of a target CD45 gene, as well as compositions and methods for treating diseases and disorders caused by the expression of CD45, such as an infectious disease or autoimmune disease. The pharmaceutical compositions featured in the invention include a dsRNA having an antisense strand having a region of complementarity which is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length, and is substantially complementary to at least part of an RNA transcript of the CD45 gene, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, certain aspects featured in the invention provide pharmaceutical compositions including a dsRNA targeting CD45 together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, methods of using the compositions to inhibit expression of the CD45 gene, and methods of using the pharmaceutical compositions to treat diseases caused by expression of the CD45 gene.\n\n\n \nI. DEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nFor convenience, the meaning of certain terms and phrases used in the specification, examples, and appended claims, are provided below. If there is an apparent discrepancy between the usage of a term in other parts of this specification and its definition provided in this section, the definition in this section shall prevail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“G,” “C,” “A,” “T” and “U” each generally stand for a nucleotide that contains guanine, cytosine, adenine, thymidine and uracil as a base, respectively. However, it will be understood that the term “ribonucleotide” or “nucleotide” can also refer to a modified nucleotide, as further detailed below, or a surrogate replacement moiety. The skilled person is well aware that guanine, cytosine, adenine, thymidine and uracil may be replaced by other moieties without substantially altering the base pairing properties of an oligonucleotide including a nucleotide bearing such replacement moiety. For example, without limitation, a nucleotide including inosine as its base may base pair with nucleotides containing adenine, cytosine, or uracil. Hence, nucleotides containing uracil, guanine, or adenine may be replaced in the dsRNAs featured in the invention by a nucleotide containing, for example, inosine. In another example, adenine and cytosine anywhere in the oligonucleotide can be replaced with guanine and uracil, respectively to form G-U Wobble base pairing with the target mRNA. Sequences including such replacement moieties are embodiments featured in the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy “CD45” as used herein is meant a CD45 mRNA, protein, peptide, or polypeptide. The term “CD45” is also known in the art as PTPRC (protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type, C), B220, GP180, LCA, LY5, and T200. The sequence of human CD45 cDNA is recorded at GenBank Accession No. NM\n—\n002838.2 (version dated Jan. 13, 2008) (see \nFIGS. 5A and 5B\n). Other human CD45 sequences are recorded at GenBank Accession Nos. NM\n—\n080921.2, NM\n—\n080922.2, NM\n—\n080923.2, Y00062.1, Y00638.1, BC014239.2, BC017863.1, BC031525.1, BC121086.1, BC121087.1, BC127656.1, BC127657.1, AY429565.1, AY567999.1, AK130573.1, DA670254.1, DA948670.1, AY429566.1, and CR621867.1. Mouse CD45 mRNA sequences are found at GenBank Accession Nos. NM\n—\n011210.2, AK054056.1, AK088215.1, AK154893.1, AK171802.1, BC028512.1, EF101553.1, L36091.1, M11934.1, M14342.1, M14343.1, M15174.1, M17320.1, and M92933.1. Rhesus monkey CD45 mRNA sequence are found at GenBank Accession No. XR\n—\n012672.1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “target sequence” refers to a contiguous portion of the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA molecule formed during the transcription of the CD45 gene, including mRNA that is a product of RNA processing of a primary transcription product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “strand including a sequence” refers to an oligonucleotide including a chain of nucleotides that is described by the sequence referred to using the standard nucleotide nomenclature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “complementary”, “fully complementary” and “substantially complementary” herein may be used with respect to the base matching between the sense strand and the antisense strand of a dsRNA, or between the antisense strand of a dsRNA and a target sequence, as will be understood from the context of their use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, and unless otherwise indicated, the term “complementary,” when used to describe a first nucleotide sequence in relation to a second nucleotide sequence, refers to the ability of an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide including the first nucleotide sequence to hybridize and form a duplex structure under certain conditions with an oligonucleotide or polynucleotide including the second nucleotide sequence, as will be understood by the skilled person. Complimentary includes both fully complimentary and substantially complimentary states. Fully complimentary means comlimentarity at each nucleotide pair of to compared sequences, e.g., an antisence strand and the corresponding portion of a target mRNA. For substantial complementarity, such conditions can, for example, be stringent conditions, where stringent conditions may include: 400 mM NaCl, 40 mM PIPES pH 6.4, 1 mM EDTA, 50° C. or 70° C. for 12-16 hours followed by washing. Other conditions, such as physiologically relevant conditions as may be encountered inside an organism, can apply. The skilled person will be able to determine the set of conditions most appropriate for a test of complementarity of two sequences in accordance with the ultimate application of the hybridized nucleotides. In other embodiments, substantial complimentarity can mean not more than 4, 3 or 2 mismatched base pairs upon hybridization, while retaining the ability to hybridize under the conditions most relevant to their ultimate application. Where two oligonucleotides are designed to form, upon hybridization, one or more single stranded overhangs, such overhangs shall not be regarded as mismatches with regard to the determination of complementarity. For example, a dsRNA including one oligonucleotide 21 nucleotides in length and another oligonucleotide 23 nucleotides in length, wherein the longer oligonucleotide includes a sequence of 21 nucleotides that is fully complementary to the shorter oligonucleotide, may yet be referred to as “fully complementary” for the purposes of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Complementary” sequences, as used herein, may also include, or be formed entirely from, non-Watson-Crick base pairs and/or base pairs formed from non-natural and modified nucleotides, in as far as the above requirements with respect to their ability to hybridize are fulfilled. Such non-Watson-Crick base pairs includes, but not limited to, G:U Wobble or Hoogstein base pairing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a polynucleotide which is “substantially complementary to at least part of” a messenger RNA (mRNA) refers to a polynucleotide which is substantially complementary to a contiguous portion of the mRNA of interest (e.g., encoding CD45). For example, a polynucleotide is complementary to at least a part of a CD45 mRNA if the sequence is substantially complementary to a non-interrupted portion of an mRNA encoding CD45.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “double-stranded RNA” or “dsRNA”, as used herein, refers to a ribonucleic acid molecule, or complex of ribonucleic acid molecules, having a duplex structure including two anti-parallel and substantially complementary, as defined above, nucleic acid strands. The two strands forming the duplex structure may be different portions of one larger RNA molecule, or they may be separate RNA molecules. Where the two strands are part of one larger molecule, and therefore are connected by an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides between the 3′-end of one strand and the 5′ end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure, the connecting RNA chain is referred to as a “hairpin loop”. Where the two strands are connected covalently by means other than an uninterrupted chain of nucleotides between the 3′-end of one strand and the 5′ end of the respective other strand forming the duplex structure, the connecting structure is referred to as a “linker.” The RNA strands may have the same or a different number of nucleotides. The maximum number of base pairs is the number of nucleotides in the shortest strand of the dsRNA. In addition to the duplex structure, a dsRNA may comprise one or more nucleotide overhangs. A dsRNA as used herein is also referred to as a “small inhibitory RNA” or “siRNA.”\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “nucleotide overhang” refers to the unpaired nucleotide or nucleotides that protrude from the duplex structure of a dsRNA when a 3′-end of one strand of the dsRNA extends beyond the 5′-end of the other strand, or vice versa. “Blunt” or “blunt end” means that there are no unpaired nucleotides at that end of the dsRNA, i.e., no nucleotide overhang. A “blunt ended” dsRNA is a dsRNA that is double-stranded over its entire length, i.e., no nucleotide overhang at either end of the molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “antisense strand” refers to the strand of a dsRNA which includes a region that is substantially complementary to the corresponding sequence of a target sequence. As used herein, the term “region of complementarity” refers to the region on the antisense strand that is substantially complementary to a sequence, for example a target sequence, as defined herein. Where the region of complementarity is not fully complementary to the target sequence, the mismatches may be in the internal or terminal regions of the molecule. Generally, the most tolerated mismatches are in the terminal regions, e.g., within 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2 nucleotides of the 5′ and/or 3′ terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “sense strand,” as used herein, refers to the strand of a dsRNA that includes a region that is substantially complementary to a region of the antisense strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “identity” is the relationship between two or more polynucleotide sequences, as determined by comparing the sequences. Identity also means the degree of sequence relatedness between polynucleotide sequences, as determined by the match between strings of such sequences. While there exist a number of methods to measure identity between two polynucleotide sequences, the term is well known to skilled artisans (see, e.g., Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heinje, G., Academic Press (1987); and Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M. Stockton Press, New York (1991)). “Substantially identical,” as used herein, means there is a very high degree of homology (preferably 100% sequence identity) between the sense strand of the dsRNA and the corresponding part of the target gene. However, dsRNA having greater than 90% or 95% sequence identity may be used in the present invention, and thus sequence variations that might be expected due to genetic mutation, strain polymorphism, or evolutionary divergence can be tolerated. Although 100% identity is typical, the dsRNA may contain single or multiple base-pair random mismatches between the RNA and the target gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “SNALP” refers to a stable nucleic acid-lipid particle. A SNALP represents a vesicle of lipids coating a reduced aqueous interior comprising a nucleic acid such as an iRNA agent or a plasmid from which an iRNA agent is transcribed. SNALPs are described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 20060240093, 20070135372, and U.S. Ser. No. 61/045,228 filed Apr. 15, 2008. These applications are hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Introducing into a cell,” when referring to a dsRNA, means facilitating uptake or absorption into the cell, as is understood by those skilled in the art. Absorption or uptake of dsRNA can occur through unaided diffusive or active cellular processes, or by auxiliary agents or devices. The meaning of this term is not limited to cells in vitro; a dsRNA may also be “introduced into a cell,” wherein the cell is part of a living organism. In such instance, introduction into the cell will include the delivery to the organism. For example, for in vivo delivery, dsRNA can be injected into a tissue site or administered systemically. In vivo delivery can also be by a beta-glucan delivery system, such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,032,401 and 5,607,677, and U.S. Publication No. 2005/0281781. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,032,401 and 5,607,677, and U.S. Publication No. 2005/0281781 are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In vitro introduction into a cell includes methods known in the art such as electroporation and lipofection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “silence” and “inhibit the expression of,” “down-regulate the expression of,” “suppress the expression of,” and the like, in as far as they refer to the CD45 gene, herein refer to the at least partial suppression of the expression of the CD45 gene, as manifested by a reduction of the amount of CD45 mRNA, which may be isolated from a first cell or group of cells in which the CD45 gene is transcribed, and which has or have been treated such that the expression of the CD45 gene is inhibited, as compared to a second cell or group of cells substantially identical to the first cell or group of cells but which has or have not been so treated (control cells). The degree of inhibition is usually expressed in terms of\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\nmRNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrol\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncells\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n·\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the degree of inhibition may be given in terms of a reduction of a parameter that is functionally linked to CD45 gene expression, e.g. the amount of protein encoded by the CD45 gene which is present on the cell surface, or the number of cells displaying a certain phenotype, e.g apoptosis. In principle, CD45 gene silencing may be determined in any cell expressing the CD45, either constitutively or by genomic engineering, and by any appropriate assay. However, when a reference is needed in order to determine whether a given siRNA inhibits the expression of the CD45 gene by a certain degree and therefore is encompassed by the instant invention, the assays provided in the Examples below shall serve as such reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, in certain instances, expression of the CD45 gene is suppressed by at least about 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, or 50% by administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide featured in the invention. In one embodiment, the CD45 gene is suppressed by at least about 50%, 60%, or 70% by administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide featured in the invention. In another embodiment, the CD45 gene is suppressed by at least about 75%, 80%, 90% or 95% by administration of the double-stranded oligonucleotide featured in the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “treat,” “treatment,” and the like, refer to relief from or alleviation of an infectious disease or an autoimmune disease. In the context of the present invention insofar as it relates to any of the other conditions recited herein below (e.g., a CD45-mediated condition other than an infectious disease or autoimmune disease), the terms “treat,” “treatment,” and the like mean to relieve or alleviate at least one symptom associated with such condition, or to slow or reverse the progression of such condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “CD45-mediated condition or disease” and related terms and phrases refer to a condition or disorder characterized by inappropriate, e.g., greater than normal, CD45 activity. Inappropriate CD45 functional activity might arise as the result of CD45 expression in cells which normally do not express CD45 or increased CD45 expression (leading to, e.g., autoimmune disease). A CD45-mediated condition or disease may be completely or partially mediated by inappropriate CD45 functional activity. However, a CD45-mediated condition or disease is one in which modulation of CD45 results in some effect on the underlying condition or disorder (e.g., a CD45 inhibitor results in some improvement in patient well-being in at least some patients).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrases “therapeutically effective amount” and “prophylactically effective amount” refer to an amount that provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment, prevention, or management of an infectious disease or an overt symptom of infection, or an autoimmune disease. The specific amount that is therapeutically effective can be readily determined by ordinary medical practitioner, and may vary depending on factors known in the art, such as, e.g. the type of infection or autoimmune disease, the patient's history and age, the stage of the disease, and the administration of other agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “pharmaceutical composition” includes a pharmacologically effective amount of a dsRNA and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, “pharmacologically effective amount,” “therapeutically effective amount” or simply “effective amount” refers to that amount of a RNA effective to produce the intended pharmacological, therapeutic or preventive result. For example, if a given clinical treatment is considered effective when there is at least a 25% reduction in a measurable parameter associated with a disease or disorder, a therapeutically effective amount of a drug for the treatment of that disease or disorder is the amount necessary to effect at least a 25% reduction in that parameter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a carrier for administration of a therapeutic agent. Such carriers include, but are not limited to, saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof. The term specifically excludes cell culture medium. For drugs administered orally, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preservatives. Suitable inert diluents include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, and lactose, while corn starch and alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin, while the lubricating agent, if present, will generally be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a “transformed cell” is a cell into which a vector has been introduced from which a dsRNA molecule may be expressed.\n\n\n \nII. DOUBLE-STRANDED RIBONUCLEIC ACID (dsRNA)\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) molecules for inhibiting the expression of the CD45 gene in a cell or mammal. The dsRNA includes an antisense strand including a region of complementarity which is complementary to the corresponding region of an mRNA formed in the expression of the CD45 gene, and wherein the region of complementarity is less than 30 nucleotides in length, generally 19-24 nucleotides in length. In another embodiment the dsRNA, upon contact with a cell expressing said CD45 gene, inhibits the expression of said CD45 gene, e.g., in an assay described herein, e.g., in a P388D1 cell assay (or an assay based on a similar cell) as described herein, by at least 20%, or preferably by at least 40%. The dsRNA includes two RNA strands that are sufficiently complementary to hybridize to form a duplex structure. The sense strand includes a region which is complementary to the antisense strand, such that the two strands hybridize and form a duplex structure when combined under suitable conditions. Generally, the duplex structure is between 15 and 30, more generally between 18 and 25, yet more generally between 19 and 24, and most generally between 21 and 23 base pairs in length. Similarly, the region of complementarity to the target sequence is between 15 and 30, more generally between 18 and 25, yet more generally between 19 and 24, and most generally between 19 and 21 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, the dsRNA is between 10 and 15 nucleotides in length, and in other embodiments, the dsRNA is between 25 and 30 nucleotides in length. The dsRNA featured in the invention may further include one or more single-stranded nucleotide overhang(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNA can be synthesized by standard methods known in the art as further discussed below, e.g., by use of an automated DNA synthesizer, such as are commercially available from, for example, Biosearch, Applied Biosystems, Inc. In one embodiment, the CD45 gene is the human CD45 gene. In some embodiments, the antisense strand of the dsRNA includes a sense sequence from Tables 2, 4 and 5, and the sense strand of the dsRNA includes a sense sequence from Tables 2, 4 and 5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the dsRNA includes at least one nucleotide sequence selected from the groups of sequences provided in Tables 2, 4 and 5. In other embodiments, the dsRNA includes at least two sequences selected from this group, wherein one of the at least two sequences is complementary to another of the at least two sequences, and one of the at least two sequences is substantially complementary to a sequence of an mRNA generated in the expression of the CD45 gene. Generally, the dsRNA includes two oligonucleotides, wherein one oligonucleotide is described as a sense strand in Tables 2, 4, or 5, and the second oligonucleotide is described as an antisense strand in Tables 2, 4 or 5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled person is well aware that dsRNAs including a duplex structure of between 20 and 23, but specifically 21, base pairs have been identified as particularly effective in inducing RNA interference (Elbashir et al., EMBO 2001, 20:6877-6888). However, others have found that shorter or longer dsRNAs can be effective as well. In the embodiments described above, by virtue of the nature of the oligonucleotide sequences provided in Tables 2, 4, or 5, the dsRNAs featured in the invention can include at least one strand of a length of minimally 21 nt. It can be reasonably expected that shorter dsRNAs including one of the sequences of Table 2, 4 or 5, minus only a few nucleotides on one or both ends may be similarly effective as compared to the dsRNAs described above. Hence, dsRNAs including a partial sequence of at least 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more contiguous nucleotides from one of the sequences of Table 2, 4 or 5, and differing in their ability to inhibit the expression of the CD45 gene in a FACS assay as described herein below by not more than 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30% inhibition from a dsRNA including the full sequence, are contemplated by the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the dsRNA agents provided in Tables 2, 4 and 5 identify sites in the CD45 mRNA that are susceptible to RNAi based cleavage. As such, the invention further includes dsRNAs that target within the sequence targeted by one of the agents featured in the present invention. As used herein, a second dsRNA is said to target within the sequence of a first dsRNA if the second dsRNA cleaves the message anywhere within the mRNA that is complementary to the antisense strand of the first dsRNA. Such a second agent will generally consist of at least 15 contiguous nucleotides from one of the sequences provided in Tables 2, 4 and 5 coupled to additional nucleotide sequences taken from the region contiguous to the selected sequence in the CD45 gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNA featured in the invention can contain one or more mismatches to the target sequence. In one embodiment, the dsRNA targeting CD45 contains no more than 3 mismatches. If the antisense strand of the dsRNA contains mismatches to a target sequence, it is preferable that the area of mismatch not be located in the center of the region of complementarity. If the antisense strand of the dsRNA contains mismatches to the target sequence, it is preferable that the mismatch be restricted to 5 nucleotides from either end, for example 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 nucleotide from either the 5′ or 3′ end of the region of complementarity. For example, for a 23 nucleotide dsRNA strand which is complementary to a region of the CD45 gene, the dsRNA generally does not contain any mismatch within the central 13 nucleotides. The methods described within the invention can be used to determine whether a dsRNA containing a mismatch to a target sequence is effective in inhibiting the expression of the CD45 gene. Consideration of the efficacy of dsRNAs with mismatches in inhibiting expression of the CD45 gene is important, especially if the particular region of complementarity in the CD45 gene is known to have polymorphic sequence variation within the population.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, at least one end of the dsRNA has a single-stranded nucleotide overhang of 1 to 4, generally 1 or 2 nucleotides. dsRNAs having at least one nucleotide overhang have unexpectedly superior inhibitory properties than their blunt-ended counterparts. In one embodiment the presence of only one nucleotide overhang strengthens the interference activity of the dsRNA, without affecting its overall stability. dsRNA having only one overhang has proven particularly stable and effective in vivo, as well as in a variety of cells, cell culture mediums, blood, and serum. Generally, the single-stranded overhang is located at the 3′-terminal end of the antisense strand or, alternatively, at the 3′-terminal end of the sense strand. The dsRNA may also have a blunt end, generally located at the 5′-end of the antisense strand. Such dsRNAs have improved stability and inhibitory activity, thus allowing administration at low dosages, i.e., less than 5 mg/kg body weight of the recipient per day. In one embodiment, the antisense strand of the dsRNA has a 1-10 nucleotide overhang at the 3′ end and/or the 5′ end. In one embodiment, the sense strand of the dsRNA has a 1-10 nucleotide overhang at the 3′ end and/or the 5′ end. In another embodiment, one or more of the nucleotides in the overhang is replaced with a nucleoside thiophosphate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the dsRNA is chemically modified to enhance stability. The nucleic acids featured in the invention may be synthesized and/or modified by methods well established in the art, such as those described in “Current protocols in nucleic acid chemistry”, Beaucage, S. L. et al. (Edrs.), John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y., USA, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Specific examples of dsRNA compounds useful in this invention include dsRNAs containing modified backbones or no natural internucleoside linkages. As defined in this specification, dsRNAs having modified backbones include those that retain a phosphorus atom in the backbone and those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the backbone. For the purposes of this specification, and as sometimes referenced in the art, modified dsRNAs that do not have a phosphorus atom in their internucleoside backbone can also be considered to be oligonucleosides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModified dsRNA backbones include, for example, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3′-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3′-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, and boranophosphates having normal 3′-5′ linkages, 2′-5′ linked analogs of these, and those) having inverted polarity wherein the adjacent pairs of nucleoside units are linked 3′-5′ to 5′-3′ or 2′-5′ to 5′-2′. Various salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also included.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative U.S. patents that teach the preparation of the above phosphorus-containing linkages include, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat.

The base units are maintained for hybridization with an appropriate nucleic acid target compound. One such oligomeric compound, a dsRNA mimetic that has been shown to have excellent hybridization properties, is referred to as a peptide nucleic acid (PNA). In PNA compounds, the sugar backbone of a dsRNA is replaced with an amide containing backbone, in particular an aminoethylglycine backbone. The nucleobases are retained and are bound directly or indirectly to aza nitrogen atoms of the amide portion of the backbone.

The present invention also includes dsRNA compounds which are chimeric compounds. “Chimeric” dsRNA compounds or “chimeras,” in the context of this invention, are dsRNA compounds, particularly dsRNAs, which contain two or more chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least one monomer unit, i.e., a nucleotide in the case of a dsRNA compound. These dsRNAs typically contain at least one region wherein the dsRNA is modified so as to confer upon the dsRNA increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, and/or increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid. An additional region of the dsRNA may serve as a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA:DNA or RNA:RNA hybrids. By way of example, RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of dsRNA inhibition of gene expression. Consequently, comparable results can often be obtained with shorter dsRNAs when chimeric dsRNAs are used, compared to phosphorothioate deoxydsRNAs hybridizing to the same target region. Cleavage of the RNA target can be routinely detected by gel electrophoresis and, if necessary, associated nucleic acid hybridization techniques known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain instances, the dsRNA may be modified by a non-ligand group. A number of non-ligand molecules have been conjugated to dsRNAs in order to enhance the activity, cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the dsRNA, and procedures for performing such conjugations are available in the scientific literature. Such non-ligand moieties have included lipid moieties, such as cholesterol (Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1989, 86:6553), cholic acid (Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 1994, 4:1053), a thioether, e.g., hexyl-5-tritylthiol (Manoharan et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 1992, 660:306; Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let., 1993, 3:2765), a thiocholesterol (Oberhauser et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1992, 20:533), an aliphatic chain, e.g., dodecandiol or undecyl residues (Saison-Behmoaras et al., EMBO J., 1991, 10:111; Kabanov et al., FEBS Lett., 1990, 259:327; Svinarchuk et al., Biochimie, 1993, 75:49), a phospholipid, e.g., di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol or \ntriethylammonium\n 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-H-phosphonate (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36:3651; Shea et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1990, 18:3777), a polyamine or a polyethylene glycol chain (Manoharan et al., Nucleosides & Nucleotides, 1995, 14:969), or adamantane acetic acid (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36:3651), a palmityl moiety (Mishra et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1995, 1264:229), or an octadecylamine or hexylamino-carbonyl-oxycholesterol moiety (Crooke et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1996, 277:923). Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of such dsRNA conjugates have been listed above. Typical conjugation protocols involve the synthesis of dsRNAs bearing an aminolinker at one or more positions of the sequence. The amino group is then reacted with the molecule being conjugated using appropriate coupling or activating reagents. The conjugation reaction may be performed either with the dsRNA still bound to the solid support or following cleavage of the dsRNA in solution phase. Purification of the dsRNA conjugate by HPLC typically affords the pure conjugate. The use of a cholesterol conjugate is particularly suitable since such a moiety can increase targeting vaginal epithelium cells, a site of CD45 expression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVector Encoded dsRNA Agents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNA featured in the invention can also be expressed from recombinant viral vectors intracellularly in vivo. The recombinant viral vectors featured in the invention comprise sequences encoding the dsRNA and any suitable promoter for expressing the dsRNA sequences. Suitable promoters include, for example, the U6 or H1 RNA pol III promoter sequences and the cytomegalovirus promoter. Selection of other suitable promoters is within the skill in the art. The recombinant viral vectors can also comprise inducible or regulatable promoters for expression of the dsRNA in a particular tissue or in a particular intracellular environment. The use of recombinant viral vectors to deliver dsRNA to cells in vivo is discussed in more detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \ndsRNA featured in the invention can be expressed from a recombinant viral vector either as two separate, complementary RNA molecules, or as a single RNA molecule with two complementary regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny viral vector capable of accepting the coding sequences for the dsRNA molecule(s) to be expressed can be used, for example vectors derived from adenovirus (AV); adeno-associated virus (AAV); retroviruses (e.g, lentiviruses (LV), Rhabdoviruses, murine leukemia virus); herpes virus, and the like. The tropism of viral vectors can be modified by pseudotyping the vectors with envelope proteins or other surface antigens from other viruses, or by substituting different viral capsid proteins, as appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, lentiviral vectors can be pseudotyped with surface proteins from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), rabies, Ebola, Mokola, and the like. AAV vectors can be made to target different cells by engineering the vectors to express different capsid protein serotypes. For example, an AAV vector expressing a \nserotype\n 2 capsid on a \nserotype\n 2 genome is called \nAAV\n 2/2. This \nserotype\n 2 capsid gene in the \nAAV\n 2/2 vector can be replaced by a serotype 5 capsid gene to produce an \nAAV\n 2/5 vector. Techniques for constructing AAV vectors which express different capsid protein serotypes are within the skill in the art; see, e.g., Rabinowitz J E et al. (2002), J Virol 76:791-801, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelection of recombinant viral vectors suitable for use in the invention, methods for inserting nucleic acid sequences for expressing the dsRNA into the vector, and methods of delivering the viral vector to the cells of interest are within the skill in the art. See, for example, Dornburg R (1995), Gene Therap. 2: 301-310; Eglitis M A (1988), Biotechniques 6: 608-614; Miller A D (1990), Hum Gene Therap. 1: 5-14; Anderson W F (1998), Nature 392: 25-30; and Rubinson D A et al., Nat. Genet. 33: 401-406, the entire disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical viral vectors are those derived from AV and AAV. In one embodiment, the dsRNA featured in the invention is expressed as two separate, complementary single-stranded RNA molecules from a recombinant AAV vector including, for example, either the U6 or H1 RNA promoters, or the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable AV vector for expressing the dsRNA featured in the invention, a method for constructing the recombinant AV vector, and a method for delivering the vector into target cells, are described in Xia H et al. (2002), Nat. Biotech. 20: 1006-1010.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable AAV vectors for expressing the dsRNA featured in the invention, methods for constructing the recombinant AV vector, and methods for delivering the vectors into target cells are described in Samulski R et al. (1987), J. Virol. 61: 3096-3101; Fisher K J et al. (1996), J. Virol, 70: 520-532; Samulski R et al. (1989), J. Virol. 63: 3822-3826; U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,479; U.S. Pat.

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS INCLUDING dsRNA\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention provides pharmaceutical compositions including a dsRNA, as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition including the dsRNA is useful for treating a disease or disorder associated with the expression or activity of the CD45 gene, such as pathological processes mediated by CD45 expression. Such pharmaceutical compositions are formulated based on the mode of delivery. One example is compositions that are formulated for systemic administration via parenteral delivery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions featured in the invention are administered in dosages sufficient to inhibit expression of the CD45 gene. The present inventors have found that, because of their improved efficiency, compositions including the dsRNA can be administered at surprisingly low dosages. Dosages of 0.6 mg or greater of dsRNA per kilogram body weight of recipient per day is sufficient to suppress expression of the CD45 gene by greater than 35%, with higher dosages capable of achieving 65% reduction in expression of the CD45 gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, a suitable dose of dsRNA will be in the range of 0.01 to 200.0 milligrams per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, generally in the range of 0.02 to 50 mg per kilogram body weight per day. For example, the dsRNA can be administered at 0.01, 0.1, 0.05 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg per single dose. The pharmaceutical composition may be administered once daily, or the dsRNA may be administered as two, three, or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day or even using continuous infusion or delivery through a controlled release formulation. In that case, the dsRNA contained in each sub-dose must be correspondingly smaller in order to achieve the total daily dosage. The dosage unit can also be compounded for delivery over several days, e.g., using a conventional sustained release formulation which provides sustained release of the dsRNA over a several day period. Sustained release formulations are well known in the art and are particularly useful for vaginal delivery of agents, such as could be used with the dsRNAs featured in the invention. In this embodiment, the dosage unit contains a corresponding multiple of the daily dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe skilled artisan will appreciate that certain factors may influence the dosage and timing required to effectively treat a subject, including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments, the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Moreover, treatment of a subject with a therapeutically effective amount of a composition can include a single treatment or a series of treatments. Estimates of effective dosages and in vivo half-lives for the individual dsRNAs encompassed by the invention can be made using conventional methodologies or on the basis of in vivo testing using an appropriate animal model, as described elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdvances in mouse genetics have generated a number of mouse models for the study of various human diseases, such as pathological processes mediated by CD45 expression. Such models are used for in vivo testing of dsRNA, as well as for determining a therapeutically effective dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions and formulations which include dsRNA targeting CD45. The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in a number of ways depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (e.g., by a transdermal patch), pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal and transdermal), oral or parenteral. Administration may also be designed to result in preferential localization to particular tissues through local delivery, e.g., by direct intraarticular injection into joints, by rectal administration for direct delivery to the gut and intestines, by intravaginal administration for delivery to the cervix and vagina, by intravitreal administration for delivery to the eye. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, intraarticular, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or infusion; subdermal, e.g., via an implanted device; or intracranial, e.g., by intrathecal or intraventricular administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful. Typical topical formulations include those in which the dsRNAs featured in the invention are in admixture with a topical delivery agent such as lipids, liposomes, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, steroids, chelating agents and surfactants. Typical lipids and liposomes include neutral (e.g., dioleoylphosphatidyl DOPE ethanolamine, dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline DMPC, distearolyphosphatidyl choline) negative (e.g., dimyristoylphosphatidyl glycerol DMPG), and cationic (e.g., dioleoyltetramethylaminopropyl DOTAP and dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine DOTMA). DsRNAs featured the invention may be encapsulated within liposomes or may form complexes thereto, in particular to cationic liposomes. Alternatively, dsRNAs may be complexed to lipids, in particular to cationic lipids. Typical fatty acids and esters include but are not limited arachidonic acid, oleic acid, eicosanoic acid, lauric acid, caprylic acid, capric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monoolein, dilaurin, glyceryl 1-monocaprate, 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, an acylcarnitine, an acylcholine, or a C\n1-10 \nalkyl ester (e.g., isopropylmyristate IPM), monoglyceride, diglyceride or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Topical formulations are described in detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/315,298 filed May 20, 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, a dsRNA featured in the invention is fully encapsulated in the lipid formulation (e.g., to form a SPLP, pSPLP, SNALP, or other nucleic acid-lipid particle). As used herein, the term “SNALP” refers to a stable nucleic acid-lipid particle, including SPLP. As used herein, the term “SPLP” refers to a nucleic acid-lipid particle comprising plasmid DNA encapsulated within a lipid vesicle. SNALPs and SPLPs typically contain a cationic lipid, a non-cationic lipid, and a lipid that prevents aggregation of the particle (e.g., a PEG-lipid conjugate). SNALPs and SPLPs are extremely useful for systemic applications, as they exhibit extended circulation lifetimes following intravenous (i.v.) injection and accumulate at distal sites (e.g., sites physically separated from the administration site). SPLPs include “pSPLP,” which include an encapsulated condensing agent-nucleic acid complex as set forth in PCT Publication No. WO 00/03683. The particles of the present invention typically have a mean diameter of about 50 nm to about 150 nm, more typically about 60 nm to about 130 nm, more typically about 70 nm to about 110 nm, most typically about 70 to about 90 nm, and are substantially nontoxic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the nucleic acids when present in the nucleic acid-lipid particles of the present invention are resistant in aqueous solution to degradation with a nuclease. Nucleic acid-lipid particles and their method of preparation are disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,976,567; 5,981,501; 6,534,484; 6,586,410; 6,815,432; and PCT Publication No. WO 96/40964.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the lipid to drug ratio (mass/mass ratio) (e.g., lipid to dsRNA ratio) will be in the range of from about 1:1 to about 50:1, from about 1:1 to about 25:1, from about 3:1 to about 15:1, from about 4:1 to about 10:1, from about 5:1 to about 9:1, or about 6:1 to about 9:1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cationic lipid may be, for example, N,N-dioleyl-N,N-dimethylammonium chloride (DODAC), N,N-distearyl-N,N-dimethylammonium bromide (DDAB), N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP), N-(1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA), N,N-dimethyl-2,3-dioleyloxy)propylamine (DODMA), 1,2-DiLinoleyloxy-N,N-dimethylaminopropane (DLinDMA),1,2-Dilinolenyloxy-N,N-dimethylaminopropane (DLenDMA), 1,2-Dilinoleylcarbamoyloxy-3-dimethylaminopropane (DLin-C-DAP), 1,2-Dilinoleyoxy-3-(dimethylamino)acetoxypropane (DLin-DAC), 1,2-Dilinoleyoxy-3-morpholinopropane (DLin-MA), 1,2-Dilinoleoyl-3-dimethylaminopropane (DLinDAP), 1,2-Dilinoleylthio-3-dimethylaminopropane (DLin-S-DMA), 1-Linoleoyl-2-linoleyloxy-3-dimethylaminopropane (DLin-2-DMAP), 1,2-Dilinoleyloxy-3-trimethylaminopropane chloride salt (DLin-TMA.Cl), 1,2-Dilinoleoyl-3-trimethylaminopropane chloride salt (DLin-TAP.Cl), 1,2-Dilinoleyloxy-3-(N-methylpiperazino)propane (DLin-MPZ), or 3-(N,N-Dilinoleylamino)-1,2-propanediol (DLinAP), 3-(N,N-Dioleylamino)-1,2-propanedio (DOAP), 1,2-Dilinoleyloxo-3-(2-N,N-dimethylamino)ethoxypropane (DLin-EG-DMA), 2,2-Dilinoleyl-4-dimethylaminomethyl-[1,3]-dioxolane (DLin-K-DMA), or a mixture thereof. The cationic lipid may comprise from about 20 mol % to about 50 mol % or about 40 mol % of the total lipid present in the particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe non-cationic lipid may be an anionic lipid or a neutral lipid including, but not limited to, distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG), dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (DOPE-mal), dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine (DPPE), dimyristoylphosphoethanolamine (DMPE), distearoyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (DSPE), 16-O-monomethyl PE, 16-O-dimethyl PE, 18-1-trans PE, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidyethanolamine (SOPE), cholesterol, or a mixture thereof. The non-cationic lipid may be from about 5 mol % to about 90 mol %, about 10 mol %, or about 58 mol % if cholesterol is included, of the total lipid present in the particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe conjugated lipid that inhibits aggregation of particles may be, for example, a polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-lipid including, without limitation, a PEG-diacylglycerol (DAG), a PEG-dialkyloxypropyl (DAA), a PEG-phospholipid, a PEG-ceramide (Cer), or a mixture thereof. The PEG-DAA conjugate may be, for example, a PEG-dilauryloxypropyl (Ci\n2\n), a PEG-dimyristyloxypropyl (Ci\n4\n), a PEG-dipalmityloxypropyl (Ci\n6\n), or a PEG-distearyloxypropyl (C]\n8\n). The conjugated lipid that prevents aggregation of particles may be from 0 mol % to about 20 mol % or about 2 mol % of the total lipid present in the particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the nucleic acid-lipid particle further includes cholesterol at, e.g., about 10 mol % to about 60 mol % or about 48 mol % of the total lipid present in the particle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the lipidoid ND98.4HCl (MW 1487) (Formula 1), Cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich), and PEG-Ceramide C16 (Avanti Polar Lipids) can be used to prepare lipid-siRNA nanoparticles (i.e., LNP01 particles). Stock solutions of each in ethanol can be prepared as follows: ND98, 133 mg/mL; Cholesterol, 25 mg/mL, PEG-Ceramide C16, 100 mg/mL. The ND98, Cholesterol, and PEG-Ceramide C16 stock solutions can then be combined in a, e.g., 42:48:10 molar ratio. The combined lipid solution can be mixed with aqueous siRNA (e.g., in sodium acetate pH 5) such that the final ethanol concentration is about 35-45% and the final sodium acetate concentration is about 100-300 mM. Lipid-siRNA nanoparticles typically form spontaneously upon mixing. Depending on the desired particle size distribution, the resultant nanoparticle mixture can be extruded through a polycarbonate membrane (e.g., 100 nm cut-off) using, for example, a thermobarrel extruder, such as Lipex Extruder (Northern Lipids, Inc). In some cases, the extrusion step can be omitted. Ethanol removal and simultaneous buffer exchange can be accomplished by, for example, dialysis or tangential flow filtration. Buffer can be exchanged with, for example, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at about pH 7, e.g., about pH 6.9, about pH 7.0, about pH 7.1, about pH 7.2, about pH 7.3, or about pH 7.4.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLNP01 formulations are described, e.g., in International Application Publication No. WO 2008/042973, which is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations prepared by either the standard or extrusion-free method can be characterized in similar manners. For example, formulations are typically characterized by visual inspection. They should be whitish translucent solutions free from aggregates or sediment. Particle size and particle size distribution of lipid-nanoparticles can be measured by light scattering using, for example, a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, USA). Particles should be about 20-300 nm, such as 40-100 nm in size. The particle size distribution should be unimodal. The total siRNA concentration in the formulation, as well as the entrapped fraction, is estimated using a dye exclusion assay. A sample of the formulated siRNA can be incubated with an RNA-binding dye, such as Ribogreen (Molecular Probes) in the presence or absence of a formulation disrupting surfactant, e.g., 0.5% Triton-X100. The total siRNA in the formulation can be determined by the signal from the sample containing the surfactant, relative to a standard curve. The entrapped fraction is determined by subtracting the “free” siRNA content (as measured by the signal in the absence of surfactant) from the total siRNA content.

These compositions may be generated from a variety of components that include, but are not limited to, preformed liquids, self-emulsifying solids and self-emulsifying semisolids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical formulations featured in the invention, which may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, may be prepared according to conventional techniques well known in the pharmaceutical industry. Such techniques include the step of bringing into association the active ingredients with the pharmaceutical carrier(s) or excipient(s). In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredients with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions featured in the invention may be formulated into any of many possible dosage forms such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gel capsules, liquid syrups, soft gels, suppositories, and enemas. The compositions featured in the invention may also be formulated as suspensions in aqueous, non-aqueous or mixed media. Aqueous suspensions may further contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension including, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran. The suspension may also contain stabilizers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated and used as a foam. Pharmaceutical foams include formulations such as, but not limited to, emulsions, microemulsions, creams, jellies and liposomes. While basically similar in nature these formulations vary in the components and the consistency of the final product. The preparation of such compositions and formulations is generally known to those skilled in the pharmaceutical and formulation arts and may be applied to the formulation of the compositions featured herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmulsions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions featured in the invention may be prepared and formulated as emulsions. Emulsions are typically heterogenous systems of one liquid dispersed in another in the form of droplets usually exceeding 0.1 μm in diameter (Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 199; Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nVolume\n 1, p. 245; Block in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 2, p. 335; Higuchi et al., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 301). Emulsions are often biphasic systems including two immiscible liquid phases intimately mixed and dispersed with each other. In general, emulsions may be of either the water-in-oil (w/o) or the oil-in-water (o/w) variety. When an aqueous phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk oily phase, the resulting composition is called a water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion. Alternatively, when an oily phase is finely divided into and dispersed as minute droplets into a bulk aqueous phase, the resulting composition is called an oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion. Emulsions may contain additional components in addition to the dispersed phases, and the active drug which may be present as a solution in either the aqueous phase, oily phase or itself as a separate phase. Pharmaceutical excipients such as emulsifiers, stabilizers, dyes, and anti-oxidants may also be present in emulsions as needed. Pharmaceutical emulsions may also be multiple emulsions that are comprised of more than two phases such as, for example, in the case of oil-in-water-in-oil (o/w/o) and water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) emulsions. Such complex formulations often provide certain advantages that simple binary emulsions do not. Multiple emulsions in which individual oil droplets of an o/w emulsion enclose small water droplets constitute a w/o/w emulsion. Likewise a system of oil droplets enclosed in globules of water stabilized in an oily continuous phase provides an o/w/o emulsion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEmulsions are characterized by little or no thermodynamic stability. Often, the dispersed or discontinuous phase of the emulsion is well dispersed into the external or continuous phase and maintained in this form through the means of emulsifiers or the viscosity of the formulation. Either of the phases of the emulsion may be a semisolid or a solid, as is the case of emulsion-style ointment bases and creams. Other means of stabilizing emulsions entail the use of emulsifiers that may be incorporated into either phase of the emulsion. Emulsifiers may broadly be classified into four categories: synthetic surfactants, naturally occurring emulsifiers, absorption bases, and finely dispersed solids (Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 199).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthetic surfactants, also known as surface active agents, have found wide applicability in the formulation of emulsions and have been reviewed in the literature (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 285; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, \nvolume\n 1, p. 199). Surfactants are typically amphiphilic and comprise a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic portion. The ratio of the hydrophilic to the hydrophobic nature of the surfactant has been termed the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB) and is a valuable tool in categorizing and selecting surfactants in the preparation of formulations. Surfactants may be classified into different classes based on the nature of the hydrophilic group: nonionic, anionic, cationic and amphoteric (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 285).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNaturally occurring emulsifiers used in emulsion formulations include lanolin, beeswax, phosphatides, lecithin and acacia. Absorption bases possess hydrophilic properties such that they can soak up water to form w/o emulsions yet retain their semisolid consistencies, such as anhydrous lanolin and hydrophilic petrolatum. Finely divided solids have also been used as good emulsifiers especially in combination with surfactants and in viscous preparations. These include polar inorganic solids, such as heavy metal hydroxides, nonswelling clays such as bentonite, attapulgite, hectorite, kaolin, montmorillonite, colloidal aluminum silicate and colloidal magnesium aluminum silicate, pigments and nonpolar solids such as carbon or glyceryl tristearate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA large variety of non-emulsifying materials are also included in emulsion formulations and contribute to the properties of emulsions. These include fats, oils, waxes, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty esters, humectants, hydrophilic colloids, preservatives and antioxidants (Block, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 335; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 199).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHydrophilic colloids or hydrocolloids include naturally occurring gums and synthetic polymers such as polysaccharides (for example, acacia, agar, alginic acid, carrageenan, guar gum, karaya gum, and tragacanth), cellulose derivatives (for example, carboxymethylcellulose and carboxypropylcellulose), and synthetic polymers (for example, carbomers, cellulose ethers, and carboxyvinyl polymers). These disperse or swell in water to form colloidal solutions that stabilize emulsions by forming strong interfacial films around the dispersed-phase droplets and by increasing the viscosity of the external phase.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSince emulsions often contain a number of ingredients such as carbohydrates, proteins, sterols and phosphatides that may readily support the growth of microbes, these formulations often incorporate preservatives. Commonly used preservatives included in emulsion formulations include methyl paraben, propyl paraben, quaternary ammonium salts, benzalkonium chloride, esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and boric acid. Antioxidants are also commonly added to emulsion formulations to prevent deterioration of the formulation. Antioxidants used may be free radical scavengers such as tocopherols, alkyl gallates, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, or reducing agents such as ascorbic acid and sodium metabisulfite, and antioxidant synergists such as citric acid, tartaric acid, and lecithin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe application of emulsion formulations via dermatological, oral and parenteral routes and methods for their manufacture have been reviewed in the literature (Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 199). Emulsion formulations for oral delivery have been very widely used because of ease of formulation, as well as efficacy from an absorption and bioavailability standpoint (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 245; Idson, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 199). Mineral-oil base laxatives, oil-soluble vitamins and high fat nutritive preparations are among the materials that have commonly been administered orally as o/w emulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the compositions of dsRNAs and nucleic acids are formulated as microemulsions. A microemulsion may be defined as a system of water, oil and amphiphile which is a single optically isotropic and thermodynamically stable liquid solution (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 245). Typically, microemulsions are systems that are prepared by first dispersing an oil in an aqueous surfactant solution and then adding a sufficient amount of a fourth component, generally an intermediate chain-length alcohol to form a transparent system. Therefore, microemulsions have also been described as thermodynamically stable, isotropically clear dispersions of two immiscible liquids that are stabilized by interfacial films of surface-active molecules (Leung and Shah, in: Controlled Release of Drugs: Polymers and Aggregate Systems, Rosoff, M., Ed., 1989, VCH Publishers, New York, pages 185-215). Microemulsions commonly are prepared via a combination of three to five components that include oil, water, surfactant, cosurfactant and electrolyte. Whether the microemulsion is of the water-in-oil (w/o) or an oil-in-water (o/w) type is dependent on the properties of the oil and surfactant used and on the structure and geometric packing of the polar heads and hydrocarbon tails of the surfactant molecules (Schott, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 271).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phenomenological approach utilizing phase diagrams has been extensively studied and has yielded a comprehensive knowledge, to one skilled in the art, of how to formulate microemulsions (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 245; Block, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 335). Compared to conventional emulsions, microemulsions offer the advantage of solubilizing water-insoluble drugs in a formulation of thermodynamically stable droplets that are formed spontaneously.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurfactants used in the preparation of microemulsions include, but are not limited to, ionic surfactants, non-ionic surfactants, Brij 96, polyoxyethylene oleyl ethers, polyglycerol fatty acid esters, tetraglycerol monolaurate (ML310), tetraglycerol monooleate (MO310), hexaglycerol monooleate (PO310), hexaglycerol pentaoleate (PO500), decaglycerol monocaprate (MCA750), decaglycerol monooleate (M0750), decaglycerol sequioleate (SO750), decaglycerol decaoleate (DAO750), alone or in combination with cosurfactants. The cosurfactant, usually a short-chain alcohol such as ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol, serves to increase the interfacial fluidity by penetrating into the surfactant film and consequently creating a disordered film because of the void space generated among surfactant molecules. Microemulsions may, however, be prepared without the use of cosurfactants and alcohol-free self-emulsifying microemulsion systems are known in the art. The aqueous phase may typically be, but is not limited to, water, an aqueous solution of the drug, glycerol, PEG300, PEG400, polyglycerols, propylene glycols, and derivatives of ethylene glycol. The oil phase may include, but is not limited to, materials such as \nCaptex\n 300, Captex 355, Capmul MCM, fatty acid esters, medium chain (C8-C12) mono, di, and tri-glycerides, polyoxyethylated glyceryl fatty acid esters, fatty alcohols, polyglycolized glycerides, saturated polyglycolized C8-C10 glycerides, vegetable oils and silicone oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroemulsions are particularly of interest from the standpoint of drug solubilization and the enhanced absorption of drugs. Lipid based microemulsions (both o/w and w/o) have been proposed to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs, including peptides (Constantinides et al., Pharmaceutical Research, 1994, 11, 1385-1390; Ritschel, Meth. Find. Exp. Clin. Pharmacol., 1993, 13, 205). Microemulsions afford advantages of improved drug solubilization, protection of drug from enzymatic hydrolysis, possible enhancement of drug absorption due to surfactant-induced alterations in membrane fluidity and permeability, ease of preparation, ease of oral administration over solid dosage forms, improved clinical potency, and decreased toxicity (Constantinides et al., Pharmaceutical Research, 1994, 11, 1385; Ho et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 1996, 85, 138-143). Often microemulsions may form spontaneously when their components are brought together at ambient temperature. This may be particularly advantageous when formulating thermolabile drugs, peptides or dsRNAs. Microemulsions have also been effective in the transdermal delivery of active components in both cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. It is expected that the microemulsion compositions and formulations featured in the invention will facilitate the increased systemic absorption of dsRNAs and nucleic acids from the gastrointestinal tract, as well as improve the local cellular uptake of dsRNAs and nucleic acids within the gastrointestinal tract, vagina, buccal cavity and other areas of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroemulsions may also contain additional components and additives such as sorbitan monostearate (Grill 3), Labrasol, and penetration enhancers to improve the properties of the formulation and to enhance the absorption of the dsRNAs and nucleic acids featured in the invention. Penetration enhancers used in microemulsions may be classified as belonging to one of five broad categories—surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating non-surfactants (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92). Each of these classes has been discussed above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere are many organized surfactant structures besides microemulsions that have been studied and used for the formulation of drugs. These include monolayers, micelles, bilayers and vesicles. Vesicles, such as liposomes, have attracted great interest because of their specificity and the duration of action they offer from the standpoint of drug delivery. As used herein, the term “liposome” means a vesicle composed of amphiphilic lipids arranged in a spherical bilayer or bilayers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes are unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles which have a membrane formed from a lipophilic material and an aqueous interior. The aqueous portion contains the composition to be delivered. Cationic liposomes possess the advantage of being able to fuse to the cell wall. Non-cationic liposomes, although not able to fuse as efficiently with the cell wall, are taken up by macrophages in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to cross intact mammalian skin, lipid vesicles must pass through a series of fine pores, each with a diameter less than 50 nm, under the influence of a suitable transdermal gradient. Therefore, it is desirable to use a liposome which is highly deformable and able to pass through such fine pores.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther advantages of liposomes include; liposomes obtained from natural phospholipids are biocompatible and biodegradable; liposomes can incorporate a wide range of water and lipid soluble drugs; liposomes can protect encapsulated drugs in their internal compartments from metabolism and degradation (Rosoff, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Lieberman, Rieger and Banker (Eds.), 1988, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., \nvolume\n 1, p. 245). Important considerations in the preparation of liposome formulations are the lipid surface charge, vesicle size and the aqueous volume of the liposomes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes are useful for the transfer and delivery of active ingredients to the site of action. Because the liposomal membrane is structurally similar to biological membranes, when liposomes are applied to a tissue, the liposomes start to merge with the cellular membranes and as the merging of the liposome and cell progresses, the liposomal contents are emptied into the cell where the active agent may act.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomal formulations have been the focus of extensive investigation as the mode of delivery for many drugs. There is growing evidence that for topical administration, liposomes present several advantages over other formulations. Such advantages include reduced side-effects related to high systemic absorption of the administered drug, increased accumulation of the administered drug at the desired target, and the ability to administer a wide variety of drugs, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic, into the skin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral reports have detailed the ability of liposomes to deliver agents including high-molecular weight DNA into the skin. Compounds including analgesics, antibodies, hormones and high-molecular weight DNAs have been administered to the skin. The majority of applications resulted in the targeting of the upper epidermis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes fall into two broad classes. Cationic liposomes are positively charged liposomes which interact with the negatively charged DNA molecules to form a stable complex. The positively charged DNA/liposome complex binds to the negatively charged cell surface and is internalized in an endosome. Due to the acidic pH within the endosome, the liposomes are ruptured, releasing their contents into the cell cytoplasm (Wang et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1987, 147, 980-985).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes which are pH-sensitive or negatively-charged, entrap DNA rather than complex with it. Since both the DNA and the lipid are similarly charged, repulsion rather than complex formation occurs. Nevertheless, some DNA is entrapped within the aqueous interior of these liposomes. pH-sensitive liposomes have been used to deliver DNA encoding the thymidine kinase gene to cell monolayers in culture. Expression of the exogenous gene was detected in the target cells (Zhou et al., Journal of Controlled Release, 1992, 19, 269-274).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne major type of liposomal composition includes phospholipids other than naturally-derived phosphatidylcholine. Neutral liposome compositions, for example, can be formed from dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Anionic liposome compositions generally are formed from dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol, while anionic fusogenic liposomes are formed primarily from dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE). Another type of liposomal composition is formed from phosphatidylcholine (PC) such as, for example, soybean PC, and egg PC. Another type is formed from mixtures of phospholipid and/or phosphatidylcholine and/or cholesterol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral studies have assessed the topical delivery of liposomal drug formulations to the skin. Application of liposomes containing interferon to guinea pig skin resulted in a reduction of skin herpes sores while delivery of interferon via other means (e.g. as a solution or as an emulsion) were ineffective (Weiner et al., Journal of Drug Targeting, 1992, 2, 405-410). Further, an additional study tested the efficacy of interferon administered as part of a liposomal formulation to the administration of interferon using an aqueous system, and concluded that the liposomal formulation was superior to aqueous administration (du Plessis et al., Antiviral Research, 1992, 18, 259-265).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-ionic liposomal systems have also been examined to determine their utility in the delivery of drugs to the skin, in particular systems including non-ionic surfactant and cholesterol. Non-ionic liposomal formulations including Novasome™ I (glyceryl dilaurate/cholesterol/po-lyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether) and Novasome™ II (glyceryl distearate/cholesterol/polyoxyethylene-10-stearyl ether) were used to deliver cyclosporin-A into the dermis of mouse skin. Results indicated that such non-ionic liposomal systems were effective in facilitating the deposition of cyclosporin-A into different layers of the skin (Hu et al. S. T. P. Pharma. Sci., 1994, 4, 6, 466).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLiposomes also include “sterically stabilized” liposomes, a term which, as used herein, refers to liposomes including one or more specialized lipids that, when incorporated into liposomes, result in enhanced circulation lifetimes relative to liposomes lacking such specialized lipids. Examples of sterically stabilized liposomes are those in which part of the vesicle-forming lipid portion of the liposome (A) includes one or more glycolipids, such as monosialoganglioside G\nM1\n, or (B) is derivatized with one or more hydrophilic polymers, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is thought in the art that, at least for sterically stabilized liposomes containing gangliosides, sphingomyelin, or PEG-derivatized lipids, the enhanced circulation half-life of these sterically stabilized liposomes derives from a reduced uptake into cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) (Allen et al., FEBS Letters, 1987, 223, 42; Wu et al., Cancer Research, 1993, 53, 3765).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious liposomes including one or more glycolipids are known in the art. Papahadjopoulos et al. (Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 1987, 507, 64) reported the ability of monosialoganglioside G\nM1\n, galactocerebroside sulfate and phosphatidylinositol to improve blood half-lives of liposomes. These findings were expounded upon by Gabizon et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1988, 85, 6949). U.S. Pat. No. 4,837,028 and WO 88/04924, both to Allen et al., disclose liposomes including (1) sphingomyelin and (2) the ganglioside G\nM1 \nor a galactocerebroside sulfate ester. U.S. Pat. No. 5,543,152 (Webb et al.) discloses liposomes including sphingomyelin. Liposomes including 1,2-sn-dimyristoylphosphat-idylcholine are disclosed in WO 97/13499 (Lim et al).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany liposomes including lipids derivatized with one or more hydrophilic polymers, and methods of preparation thereof, are known in the art. Sunamoto et al. (Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 1980, 53, 2778) described liposomes including a nonionic detergent, 2C\n12\n15G, that contains a PEG moiety. Illum et al. (FEBS Lett., 1984, 167, 79) noted that hydrophilic coating of polystyrene particles with polymeric glycols results in significantly enhanced blood half-lives. Synthetic phospholipids modified by the attachment of carboxylic groups of polyalkylene glycols (e.g., PEG) are described by Sears (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,426,330 and 4,534,899). Klibanov et al. (FEBS Lett., 1990, 268, 235) described experiments demonstrating that liposomes including phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) derivatized with PEG or PEG stearate have significant increases in blood circulation half-lives. Blume et al. (Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1990, 1029, 91) extended such observations to other PEG-derivatized phospholipids, e.g., DSPE-PEG, formed from the combination of distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DSPE) and PEG. Liposomes having covalently bound PEG moieties on their external surface are described in European Patent No. \nEP\n 0 445 131 B1 and WO 90/04384 to Fisher. Liposome compositions containing 1-20 mole percent of PE derivatized with PEG, and methods of use thereof, are described by Woodle et al. (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,013,556 and 5,356,633) and Martin et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,213,804 and European Patent No. \nEP\n 0 496 813 B1). Liposomes including a number of other lipid-polymer conjugates are disclosed in WO 91/05545 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,212 (both to Martin et al.) and in WO 94/20073 (Zalipsky et al.) Liposomes including PEG-modified ceramide lipids are described in WO 96/10391 (Choi et al). U.S. Pat. No. 5,540,935 (Miyazaki et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,556,948 (Tagawa et al.) describe PEG-containing liposomes that can be further derivatized with functional moieties on their surfaces.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA limited number of liposomes including nucleic acids are known in the art. WO 96/40062 to Thierry et al. discloses methods for encapsulating high molecular weight nucleic acids in liposomes. U.S. Pat. No. 5,264,221 to Tagawa et al. discloses protein-bonded liposomes and asserts that the contents of such liposomes may include an dsRNA RNA. U.S. Pat. No. 5,665,710 to Rahman et al. describes certain methods of encapsulating oligodeoxynucleotides in liposomes. WO 97/04787 to Love et al. discloses liposomes including dsRNA dsRNAs targeted to the raf gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransfersomes are yet another type of liposomes, and are highly deformable lipid aggregates which are attractive candidates for drug delivery vehicles. Transfersomes may be described as lipid droplets which are so highly deformable that they are easily able to penetrate through pores which are smaller than the droplet. Transfersomes are adaptable to the environment in which they are used, e.g. they are self-optimizing (adaptive to the shape of pores in the skin), self-repairing, frequently reach their targets without fragmenting, and often self-loading. To make transfersomes it is possible to add surface edge-activators, usually surfactants, to a standard liposomal composition. Transfersomes have been used to deliver serum albumin to the skin. The transfersome-mediated delivery of serum albumin has been shown to be as effective as subcutaneous injection of a solution containing serum albumin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurfactants find wide application in formulations such as emulsions (including microemulsions) and liposomes. The most common way of classifying and ranking the properties of the many different types of surfactants, both natural and synthetic, is by the use of the hydrophile/lipophile balance (HLB). The nature of the hydrophilic group (also known as the “head”) provides the most useful means for categorizing the different surfactants used in formulations (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, p. 285).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the surfactant molecule is not ionized, it is classified as a nonionic surfactant. Nonionic surfactants find wide application in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products and are usable over a wide range of pH values. In general their HLB values range from 2 to about 18 depending on their structure. Nonionic surfactants include nonionic esters such as ethylene glycol esters, propylene glycol esters, glyceryl esters, polyglyceryl esters, sorbitan esters, sucrose esters, and ethoxylated esters. Nonionic alkanolamides and ethers such as fatty alcohol ethoxylates, propoxylated alcohols, and ethoxylated/propoxylated block polymers are also included in this class. The polyoxyethylene surfactants are the most popular members of the nonionic surfactant class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the surfactant molecule carries a negative charge when it is dissolved or dispersed in water, the surfactant is classified as anionic. Anionic surfactants include carboxylates such as soaps, acyl lactylates, acyl amides of amino acids, esters of sulfuric acid such as alkyl sulfates and ethoxylated alkyl sulfates, sulfonates such as alkyl benzene sulfonates, acyl isethionates, acyl taurates and sulfosuccinates, and phosphates. The most important members of the anionic surfactant class are the alkyl sulfates and the soaps.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the surfactant molecule carries a positive charge when it is dissolved or dispersed in water, the surfactant is classified as cationic. Cationic surfactants include quaternary ammonium salts and ethoxylated amines. The quaternary ammonium salts are the most used members of this class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the surfactant molecule has the ability to carry either a positive or negative charge, the surfactant is classified as amphoteric. Amphoteric surfactants include acrylic acid derivatives, substituted alkylamides, N-alkylbetaines and phosphatides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe use of surfactants in drug products, formulations and in emulsions has been reviewed (Rieger, in Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y., 1988, p. 285).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPenetration Enhancers\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, various penetration enhancers are used to effect the efficient delivery of nucleic acids, particularly dsRNAs, to the skin of animals. Most drugs are present in solution in both ionized and nonionized forms. However, usually only lipid soluble or lipophilic drugs readily cross cell membranes. It has been discovered that even non-lipophilic drugs may cross cell membranes if the membrane to be crossed is treated with a penetration enhancer. In addition to aiding the diffusion of non-lipophilic drugs across cell membranes, penetration enhancers also enhance the permeability of lipophilic drugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPenetration enhancers may be classified as belonging to one of five broad categories, i.e., surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating non-surfactants (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92). Each of the above mentioned classes of penetration enhancers are described below in greater detail.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurfactants (or “surface-active agents”) are chemical entities, which when dissolved in an aqueous solution, reduce the surface tension of the solution or the interfacial tension between the aqueous solution and another liquid, with the result that absorption of dsRNAs through the mucosa is enhanced. In addition to bile salts and fatty acids, these penetration enhancers include, for example, sodium lauryl sulfate, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether and polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, p. 92); and perfluorochemical emulsions, such as FC-43. Takahashi et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1988, 40, 252).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFatty acids: Various fatty acids and their derivatives which act as penetration enhancers include, for example, oleic acid, lauric acid, capric acid (n-decanoic acid), myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, dicaprate, tricaprate, monoolein (1-monooleoyl-rac-glycerol), dilaurin, caprylic acid, arachidonic acid, glycerol 1-monocaprate, 1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one, acylcarnitines, acylcholines, C\n1-10 \nalkyl esters thereof (e.g., methyl, isopropyl and t-butyl), and mono- and di-glycerides thereof (i.e., oleate, laurate, caprate, myristate, palmitate, stearate, linoleate, etc.) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carryier Systems, 1991, p. 92; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33; El Hariri et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1992, 44, 651-654).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBile salts: The physiological role of bile includes the facilitation of dispersion and absorption of lipids and fat-soluble vitamins (Brunton, Chapter 38 in: Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Ed., Hardman et al. Eds., McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996, pp. 934-935). Various natural bile salts, and their synthetic derivatives, act as penetration enhancers. Thus the term “bile salts” includes any of the naturally occurring components of bile as well as any of their synthetic derivatives. The bile salts include, for example, cholic acid (or its pharmaceutically acceptable sodium salt, sodium cholate), dehydrocholic acid (sodium dehydrocholate), deoxycholic acid (sodium deoxycholate), glucholic acid (sodium glucholate), glycholic acid (sodium glycocholate), glycodeoxycholic acid (sodium glycodeoxycholate), taurocholic acid (sodium taurocholate), taurodeoxycholic acid (sodium taurodeoxycholate), chenodeoxycholic acid (sodium chenodeoxycholate), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), sodium tauro-24,25-dihydro-fusidate (STDHF), sodium glycodihydrofusidate and polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether (POE) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92; Swinyard, Chapter 39 In: Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990, pages 782-783; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33; Yamamoto et al., J. Pharm. Exp. Ther., 1992, 263, 25; Yamashita et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 1990, 79, 579-583).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Chelating Agents” are defined as compounds that remove metallic ions from solution by forming complexes therewith, with the result that absorption of dsRNAs through the mucosa is enhanced. With regards to their use as penetration enhancers, chelating agents have the added advantage of also serving as DNase inhibitors, as most characterized DNA nucleases require a divalent metal ion for catalysis and are thus inhibited by chelating agents (Jarrett, J. Chromatogr., 1993, 618, 315-339). Chelating agents include but are not limited to disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), citric acid, salicylates (e.g., sodium salicylate, 5-methoxysalicylate and homovanilate), N-acyl derivatives of collagen, laureth-9 and N-amino acyl derivatives of beta-diketones (enamines) (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92; Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33; Buur et al., J. Control Rel., 1990, 14, 43-51).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-chelating non-surfactants: As used herein, non-chelating non-surfactant penetration enhancing compounds can be defined as compounds that demonstrate insignificant activity as chelating agents or as surfactants but that nonetheless enhance absorption of dsRNAs through the alimentary mucosa (Muranishi, Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1990, 7, 1-33). This class of penetration enhancers include, for example, unsaturated cyclic ureas, 1-alkyl- and 1-alkenylazacyclo-alkanone derivatives (Lee et al., Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems, 1991, page 92); and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as diclofenac sodium, indomethacin and phenylbutazone (Yamashita et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 1987, 39, 621-626).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgents that enhance uptake of dsRNAs at the cellular level may also be added to the pharmaceutical and other compositions featured in the invention. For example, cationic lipids, such as lipofectin (Junichi et al, U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,188), cationic glycerol derivatives, and polycationic molecules, such as polylysine (Lollo et al., PCT Application WO 97/30731), are also known to enhance the cellular uptake of dsRNAs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther agents may be utilized to enhance the penetration of the administered nucleic acids, including glycols such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, pyrrols such as 2-pyrrol, azones, and terpenes such as limonene and menthone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarriers\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compositions featured herein also incorporate carrier compounds in the formulation. As used herein, “carrier compound” or “carrier” can refer to a nucleic acid, or analog thereof, which is inert (i.e., does not possess biological activity per se), but is recognized as a nucleic acid by in vivo processes that reduce the bioavailability of a nucleic acid having biological activity by, for example, degrading the biologically active nucleic acid or promoting its removal from circulation. The coadministration of a nucleic acid and a carrier compound, typically with an excess of the latter substance, can result in a substantial reduction of the amount of nucleic acid recovered in the liver, kidney or other extracirculatory reservoirs, presumably due to competition between the carrier compound and the nucleic acid for a common receptor. For example, the recovery of a partially phosphorothioate dsRNA in hepatic tissue can be reduced when it is coadministered with polyinosinic acid, dextran sulfate, polycytidic acid or 4-acetamido-4′isothiocyano-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (Miyao et al., DsRNA Res. Dev., 1995, 5, 115-121; Takakura et al., DsRNA & Nucl. Acid Drug Dev., 1996, 6, 177-183.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExcipients\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast to a carrier compound, a “pharmaceutical carrier” or “excipient” is a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, suspending agent or any other pharmacologically inert vehicle for delivering one or more nucleic acids to an animal. The excipient may be liquid or solid and is selected, with the planned manner of administration in mind, so as to provide for the desired bulk, consistency, etc., when combined with a nucleic acid and the other components of a given pharmaceutical composition. Typical pharmaceutical carriers include, but are not limited to, binding agents (e.g., pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, etc.); fillers (e.g., lactose and other sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, pectin, gelatin, calcium sulfate, ethyl cellulose, polyacrylates or calcium hydrogen phosphate, etc.); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, silica, colloidal silicon dioxide, stearic acid, metallic stearates, hydrogenated vegetable oils, corn starch, polyethylene glycols, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, etc.); disintegrants (e.g., starch, sodium starch glycolate, etc.); and wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate, etc).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic excipients suitable for non-parenteral administration, and that do not deleteriously react with nucleic acids, can also be used to formulate the compositions featured in the present invention. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, water, salt solutions, alcohols, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for topical administration of nucleic acids may include sterile and non-sterile aqueous solutions, non-aqueous solutions in common solvents such as alcohols, or solutions of the nucleic acids in liquid or solid oil bases. The solutions may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives. Pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic excipients suitable for non-parenteral administration which do not deleteriously react with nucleic acids can be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include, but are not limited to, water, salt solutions, alcohol, polyethylene glycols, gelatin, lactose, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, viscous paraffin, hydroxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and the like.\n\n\n \nOther Components\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compositions featured in the invention may additionally contain other adjunct components conventionally found in pharmaceutical compositions, at their art-established usage levels. Thus, for example, the compositions may contain additional, compatible, pharmaceutically-active materials such as, for example, antipruritics, astringents, local anesthetics or anti-inflammatory agents, or may contain additional materials useful in physically formulating various dosage forms of the compositions featured in the present invention, such as dyes, flavoring agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opacifiers, thickening agents and stabilizers. However, such materials, when added, should not unduly interfere with the biological activities of the components of the compositions featured in the invention. The formulations can be sterilized and, if desired, mixed with auxiliary agents, e.g., lubricants, preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salts for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers, colorings, flavorings and/or aromatic substances and the like which do not deleteriously interact with the nucleic acid(s) of the formulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAqueous suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension including, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran. The suspension may also contain stabilizers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain embodiments featured in the invention provide pharmaceutical compositions containing (a) one or more antisense compounds and (b) one or more other therapeutic agents which function by a non-antisense mechanism. For example, the one or more other therapeutic agents include antibiotic or antiviral agents. Exemplary antibiotics include, e.g., amphotericin B, norfloxacin, miconazole nitrate, ofloxacin, idoxuridine, chloramphenicol, colistin sodium methanesulfonate, carbenicillin sodium, beta-lactam antibiotics, cefoxitin, n-formanidolthienamycin and other thienamycin derivatives, tetracyclines, neomycin, carbenicillin, colistin, penicillin G, polymyxin B, vancomycin, cefazolin, cephaloridine, chibrorifamycin, gramicidin, bacitracin and sulfonamides. Exemplary antiviral agents include, e.g., acyclovir and interferon. For the treatment of autoimmune disease the one or more other therapeutic agents can include, e.g., interferon beta (e.g., IFNbeta-1a and IFN-1b, gliatriamer acetate (Copaxone), cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, azathioprine (Imuran), cladribine (Leustatin), cyclosporine, mitoxantrone, and glucocorticoids (e.g., adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), methylprednisolone, and dexamethasone). For treatment of Graves' disease, for example, the additional therapeutic agent can be, e.g., an antithyroid drug, such as propylthiouracil (PTU) or methimazole. The invention also includes methods of treating a disorder described herein by administration of a dsRNA described herein and one or more other therapeutic agents which function by a non-antisense mechanism, e.g., one or more of the agents listed above. The agents can be administered in a single formulation or may be administered separately, at the same or at different times.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such compounds can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Suitable compounds typically exhibit high therapeutic indices.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulation a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of compositions featured in the invention lies generally within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the methods featured in the invention, the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range of the compound or, when appropriate, of the polypeptide product of a target sequence (e.g., achieving a decreased concentration of the polypeptide) that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to their administration individually or as a plurality, as discussed above, the dsRNAs featured in the invention can be administered in combination with other known agents effective in treatment of pathological processes mediated by CD45 expression. In any event, the administering physician can adjust the amount and timing of dsRNA administration on the basis of results observed using standard measures of efficacy known in the art or described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for Treating Diseases Caused by Expression of the CD45 Gene\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating a subject having a pathological condition mediated by the expression of the CD45 gene, such as an autoimmune disease or an infectious disease. In this embodiment, the dsRNA acts as a therapeutic agent for controlling the expression of the CD45 protein. The method includes administering a pharmaceutical composition featured in the invention to the patient (e.g., human), such that expression of the CD45 gene is silenced. Because of their high specificity, the dsRNAs featured in the invention specifically target mRNAs of the CD45 gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “CD45-mediated condition or disease” and related terms and phrases refer to a condition or disorder characterized by unwanted or inappropriate, e.g., abnormal CD45 activity. Inappropriate CD45 functional activity might arise as the result of CD45 expression in cells which normally do not express CD45, increased CD45 expression and/or activity (leading to, e.g., autoimmune disorders and diseases, or increased susceptibility to disease). A CD45-mediated condition or disease may be completely or partially mediated by inappropriate CD45 functional activity which may result by way of inappropriate activation of CD45. Regardless, a CD45-mediated condition or disease is one in which modulation of CD45 via RNA interference results in some effect on the underlying condition or disorder (e.g., a CD45 inhibitor results in some improvement in patient well-being in at least some patients).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-CD45 dsRNAs featured in the present invention may be used to treat or diagnose an infection or immune disorder in a subject. The methods include administering to a subject an anti-CD45 dsRNA in an amount effective to treat an infectious disease or autoimmune disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPathological processes refer to a category of biological processes that produce a deleterious effect. For example, unregulated expression of CD45 is associated with autoimmunity and infectious disease. A compound featured in the invention can typically modulate a pathological process when the compound reduces the degree or severity of the process. For instance, autoimmunity or an infection may be prevented or related pathological processes can be modulated by the administration of compounds that reduce or modulate in some way the expression or at least one activity CD45.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dsRNA molecules featured herein may, therefore, be used to treat an autoimmune or infectious disease. Autoimmune diseases that can be treated with a dsRNA that targets CD45 include, but are not limited to, Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, multiple sclerosis, and systemic sclerosis. In one embodiment, a dsRNA targeting CD45 is administered to a patient who has received an organ transplant, such as to reduce the risk of damage to the organ (e.g., from ischemia and reperfusion, such as caused by an inflammatory response) and the risk of organ rejection. Infectious diseases that can be treated with a dsRNA that targets CD45 include but are not limited to influenza, anthrax, Ebola, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), rabies, Mokola, Rous sarcoma virus, and hepatitis, such as hepatitis A, B and C strains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions encompassed by the invention may be administered by any means known in the art including, but not limited to oral or parenteral routes, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intravitreal, transdermal, airway (aerosol), nasal, rectal, vaginal and topical (including buccal and sublingual) administration, and epidural administration. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intraveneously by infusion or injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBefore administration of a full dose of a dsRNA targeting CD45, a patient can be administered a smaller dose, such as a 5% infusion reaction, and monitored for adverse effects, such as an allergic reaction. In another example, the patient can be monitored for unwanted immunostimulatory effects, such as increased cytokine (e.g., TNF-alpha or INF-alpha) levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany CD45-associated diseases and disorders are hereditary. Therefore, a patient in need of a dsRNA targeting CD45 can be identified by taking a family history. A healthcare provider, such as a doctor, nurse, or family member, can take a family history before prescribing or administering a dsRNA. A DNA test may also be performed on the patient to identify a mutation in the target gene, before a dsRNA is administered to the patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for Inhibiting Expression of the CD45 Gene\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another aspect, the invention provides a method for inhibiting the expression of the CD45 gene in a mammal. The method includes administering a CD45 dsRNA to the mammal such that expression of the target CD45 gene is silenced. Because of their high specificity, the dsRNAs specifically target RNAs (primary or processed) of the target CD45 gene. Compositions and methods for inhibiting the expression of the CD45 gene using dsRNAs can be performed as described elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the method includes administering a composition including a dsRNA, wherein the dsRNA includes a nucleotide sequence which is complementary to at least a part of an RNA transcript of the CD45 gene of the mammal to be treated. When the organism to be treated is a mammal such as a human, the composition may be administered by any means known in the art including, but not limited to oral or parenteral routes, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intracranial, subcutaneous, intravitreal, transdermal, airway (aerosol), nasal, rectal, vaginal and topical (including buccal and sublingual) administration. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by intraveneous infusion or injection.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

Human mRNA sequences to CD45, RefSeq ID number: NM\n—\n002838.3, NM\n—\n080921.2, NM\n—\n080922.2, NM\n—\n080923.2, Y00062.1, Y00638.1, BC014239.2, BC017863.1, BC031525.1, BC121086.1, BC121087.1, BC127656.1, BC127657.1, AY429565.1, AY567999.1, AK130573.1, DA670254.1, DA948670.1, AY429566.1, and CR621867.1 were used. Mouse mRNA sequences to CD45, RefSeq ID number: NM\n—\n011210.2, AK054056.1, AK088215.1, AK154893.1, AK171802.1, BC028512.1, EF101553.1, L36091.1, M11934.1, M14342.1, M14343.1, M15174.1, M17320.1, and M92933.1 were used. Rhesus monkey mRNA sequence to CD45, RefSeqID number; XR\n—\n012672.1 was also used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA duplexes cross-reactive to human, mouse and rhesus CD45 transcripts were designed. Forty-eight duplexes were synthesized and screened as outlined in Tables 1-3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sequences for human, mouse and partial rhesus CD45 mRNAs were downloaded from NCBI Nucleotide database and the human sequence (Human CD45: NM\n—\n002838.3, 5330 bp) was further used as reference sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor identification of further rhesus CD45 sequences, a blast search with the human reference sequence was conducted at NCBI against the rhesus reference genome. The downloaded rhesus sequence and the hit regions in the blast hit were assembled to a rhesus consensus sequence with 91% identity to human CD45 reference sequence over the full-length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll conserved 19 mers were extracted from the human mRNA reference sequence, resulting in the pool of candidate target sites corresponding to 5312 (sense strand) sequences. Human-mouse-rhesus cross-reactivity was defined as a prerequisite for in silico selection of siRNAs out of this candidate pool. As no conserved regions are present in all human and/or mouse variants, the criterion for selection was relaxed to cross-reactivity to most relevant human and mouse CD45 sequences, which we assumed to be RefSeq sequences as well as other mRNAs for which protein expression has been described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine cross-reactivity to human and mouse CD45 variants and rhesus-reactive siRNAs, the presence of each candidate siRNA target site was searched in the sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, the predicted specificity of the siRNA was used as criterion for selection out of the pool of human-mouse-rhesus cross-reactive siRNAs, manifested by targeting human CD45 mRNA sequences, but not other human mRNAs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specificity of an siRNA can be expressed via its potential to target other genes, which are referred to as “off-target genes.” For predicting the off-target potential of an siRNA, the following assumptions were made: (1) off-target potential of a strand can be deduced from the number and distribution of mismatches to an off-target; (2) the most relevant off-target, that is the gene predicted to have the highest probability to be silenced due to tolerance of mismatches, determines the off-target potential of the strand; (3) positions 2 to 9 (counting 5′ to 3′) of a strand (seed region) may contribute more to off-target potential than the rest of the sequence (that is non-seed and cleavage site region); (4) positions 10 and 11 (counting 5′ to 3′) of a strand (cleavage site region) may contribute more to off-target potential than non-seed region (that is positions 12 to 18, counting 5′ to 3′); (5) positions 1 and 19 of each strand are not relevant for off-target interactions; (6) off-target potential can be expressed by the off-target score of the most relevant off-target, calculated based on number and position of mismatches of the strand to the most homologous region in the off-target gene considering assumptions 3 to 5; and (7) off-target potential of antisense and sense strand will be relevant, whereas potential abortion of sense strand activity by internal modifications introduced is likely.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSiRNAs with low off-target potential were defined as preferable and assumed to be more specific.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to identify human CD45-specific siRNAs, all other human transcripts that were considered potential off-targets, were searched for potential target regions for human-mouse-rhesus cross-reactive 19 mer sense strand sequences as well as complementary antisense strands. For this, the fastA algorithm was used to determine the most homologous hit region in each sequence of the human RefSeq database, which we assume to represent the comprehensive human transcriptome.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFastA output files were analyzed further by a Perl script to rank all potential off-targets according to \nassumptions\n 3′ to 5′, and thus to identify the most relevant off-target gene and its off-target score.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe script extracted the following off-target properties for each 19 mer input sequence and each off-target gene to calculate the off-target score:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNumber of mismatches in non-seed region, number of mismatches in seed region, and number of mismatches in cleavage site region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe off-target score was calculated by considering \nassumptions\n 3 to 5 as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \nOff-target score=number of seed mismatches*10+number of cleavage site mismatches*1.2+number of non-seed mismatches*1\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most relevant off-target gene for each 19 mer sequence was defined as the gene with the lowest off-target score. Accordingly, the lowest off-target score was defined as representative for the off-target potential of a strand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the siRNA set in Table 2, cross-reactivity to rhesus, all human and mouse RefSeq sequences as well as to most variants with described protein was defined as prerequisite for selection.

For the most potent siRNAs, dose response was performed by bDNA analysis in P388D1 to identify the IC20, IC50 and IC80 dose that lowers the level of CD45 transcript by 20, 50 and 80%, respectively. siRNAs with the best IC values in the bDNA assay were screened by flow cytometry to identify the IC20, IC50 and IC80 dose required to lower the amount of CD45 protein by 20, 50 and 80%, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell Line. A P388D1 mouse macrophage cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville Md., USA; ATCC # TIB-63) and grown in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4 mM L-glutamine, 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate at 37° C. under a 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere at 37° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell Culture, siRNA transfection. P388D1 cells were plated in 24-well plates at 8×10\n4 \ncells per well in 0.4 ml growth medium a day before transfection. P388D1 cells were 80% confluent the day of siRNA transfection. Before transfection, cells are fed with 0.25 ml growth medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrior to adding to cells, 1.5 ml (50 μl per well) Optimem I (Invitrogen) and 90 μl (3 μl per well) Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen), the amount sufficient for transfection of one 24 well plate, were combined in a 2 ml Sarstedt tube and incubated for 10-15 minutes at room temperature. The appropriate amount of siRNA dissolved in transfection buffer is then added to the Optimem/\nlipofectamine\n 2000 mixture to give the desired final concentration, mixed, and incubated an additional 15-25 minutes at room temperature. 50 μl of the siRNA/reagent complex was then added dropwise to each well as dictated by the experimental design. Plates were then gently rocked to ensure complete mixing and incubated at 37° C. at 5% CO2/95% air for 48 hours. The cells were lysed and CD45 mRNA transcript was quantitated in relation to a house-keeping gene transcript by branched DNA (bDNA) assay. CD45 protein expression level was determined by flow cytometry, for this assay cells were harvested by pipetting without lysing.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA to CD45 silenced CD45 in mouse macrophages in vivo. C57B1/6J mice (Jackson Labs) were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mL of 4% Brewers thioglycollate medium (Difco) 3 days prior to injecting 10 mg/kg of 98N12-5 formulated siCD45 or siGFP i.p. (4 mice per group). The thioglycollate acted as a sterile inflammation stimulus. Peritoneal lavage was collected 4 days later and stained with fluorophore conjugated antibodies to CD11b, Gr1 and CD45 (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry samples were run on the LSR11 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (Treestar) was used to identify the CD11b\nhigh \nGr1\nlow \nmacrophage population and quantify CD45 expression. A 65% reduction of CD45 protein expression was observed in the peritoneal macrophage population when treated with the formulated CD45 siRNA (\nFIG. 1\n). Two independent dose response experiments were conducted examining the effect of 0.6-15.0 mg/kg administration of 98N12-5 formulated siCD45 or siGFP i.p. (2-3 mice per group). These experiments were conducted identically to those described above and demonstrated effective specific in vivo silencing of CD45 protein expression at all concentrations tested when treated with the formulated CD45 siRNA (\nFIG. 1\n, top panel). The 98N12-5 formulation is a lipidoid synthesized by addition of acrylamides or acrylates to amines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sequences for the sense and antisense strands of the CD45 siRNA are as follows.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-cuGGcuGAAuuucAGAGcATsT-3′ sense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 89 single strand # A22825)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5′-UGCUCUGAAAUUcAGCcAGTsT-3′ antisense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 90 single strand #_A22826)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe siGFP sequences are as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 145)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5′-CcAcAuGAAGcAGcACGACusU-3′ sense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(single strand # AL4545)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 146)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5′-AAGUCGUGCUGCUUCAUGUGgsusC-3′ antisense \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(single strand # AL4381)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2′-O-Me modified nucleotides are in lower case, and phosphorothioate linkages are represented by an “s”. siRNAs were generated by annealing equimolar amounts of complementary sense and antisense strands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll procedures used in animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and were consistent with local, state, and federal regulations as applicable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLipidoid-based siRNA formulations included lipidoid, cholesterol, poly(ethylene glycol)-lipid (PEG-lipid), and siRNA. Formulations were prepared using a protocol similar to that described by Semple and colleagues (Maurer et al. Biophys. J. 80:2310-2326, 2001; Semple et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1510:152-166, 2001). Stock solutions of 98N12-5(1).4HCl MW 1489, mPEG2000-Ceramide C16 (Avanti Polar Lipids) MW 2634 or mPEG2000-DMG MW 2660, and cholesterol MW 387 (Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared in ethanol and mixed to yield a molar ratio of 42:10:48. Mixed lipids were added to 125 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.2 to yield a solution containing 35% ethanol, resulting in spontaneous formation of empty lipidoid nanoparticles. Resulting nanoparticles were extruded through a 0.08μ membrane (2 passes). siRNA in 35% ethanol and 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5.2 was added to the nanoparticles at 1:7.5 (wt:wt) siRNA:total lipids and incubated at 37° C. for 30 min. Ethanol removal and buffer exchange of siRNA-containing lipidoid nanoparticles was achieved by tangential flow filtration against phosphate buffered saline using a 100,000 MWCO membrane. Finally, the formulation was filtered through a 0.2μ sterile filter. Particle size was determined using a Malvern Zetasizer NanoZS (Malvern, UK). siRNA content was determined by UV absorption at 260 nm and siRNA entrapment efficiency was determined by Ribogreen assay 32. Resulting particles had a mean particle diameter of approximately 50 nm, with peak width of 20 nm, and siRNA entrapment efficiency of >95%. See also PCT/US2007/080331.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\n \n \n \nBone marrow-derived macrophage transfection. Murine bone marrow derived macrophages were cultured according to standard protocol (Cunnick et al., \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n311:96-105, 2006). Cells were cultured in 12-well dishes for five days in the presence of 8 ng/mL of M-CSF. The optimal siRNA to lipidoid ratio was determined for each lipidoid (a ratio of either 5 or 10 wt:wt was used). Mixtures of irrelevant control siRNA or siCD45 (SEQ ID NOs:89 and 90, above) with lipidoids were prepared as described above. siRNA-lipidoid mixtures were added to macrophage cultures at the desired concentrations for 6 hours. Media was exchanged and GFP expression was analyzed by flow cytometry five days later. The formulated CD45 siRNA were shown to effectively silence primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages with 65% protein reduction (\nFIG. 2\n)\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\n \n \n \nCD45 as a cellular protein target that regulates infection from a broad range of pathogens. CD45 mitigates viral and bacterial infections. Genetically-modified mice with reduced expression level of CD45 were protected from \nB. anthracia\n, influenza, and Ebola (see \nFIG. 3\n). Given the ability of formulated CD45 siRNA to inhibit CD45 expression in vitro and in vivo by up to 65%, it is notable that significant protective effects against lethal Ebola challenge were seen in genetically-modified mice when CD45 expression was reduced by 11-65% (\nFIG. 3\n).\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\n \n \n \nCD45 siRNA silenced CD45 expression in human cells in vitro. The human acute myelogenous leukemia cell line, KG-1, was cultured according to standard protocol. Cells were plated into 96 wells and then untreated or treated with CD45 siRNA-lipidoid mixtures (as outlined for \nFIGS. 1 and 2\n) at the desired concentrations for 6 hours. Media was exchanged and CD45 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry four days later. The liposomally formulated CD45 siRNA were shown to effectively silence in human cells in vitro (\nFIG. 4\n). These results are consistent with the fact that the CD45 siRNA has 100% sequence identity to human and rodent CD45 and was shown to be active in reducing murine CD45 in vitro and in vivo (Table 3; \nFIGS. 1 and 2\n).\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\ndsRNA Synthesis\n\n\n \n \n \nSource of Reagents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere the source of a reagent is not specifically given herein, such reagent may be obtained from any supplier of reagents for molecular biology at a quality/purity standard for application in molecular biology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nsiRNA Synthesis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSingle-stranded RNAs were produced by solid phase synthesis on a scale of 1 μmole using an Expedite 8909 synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Applera Deutschland GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) and controlled pore glass (CPG, 500 Å, Proligo Biochemie GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) as solid support. RNA and RNA containing 2′-O-methyl nucleotides were generated by solid phase synthesis employing the corresponding phosphoramidites and 2′-O-methyl phosphoramidites, respectively (Proligo Biochemie GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). These building blocks were incorporated at selected sites within the sequence of the oligoribonucleotide chain using standard nucleoside phosphoramidite chemistry such as described in Current protocols in nucleic acid chemistry, Beaucage, S. L. et al. (Edrs.), John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y., USA. Phosphorothioate linkages were introduced by replacement of the iodine oxidizer solution with a solution of the Beaucage reagent (Chruachem Ltd, Glasgow, UK) in acetonitrile (1%). Further ancillary reagents were obtained from Mallinckrodt Baker (Griesheim, Germany).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDeprotection and purification of the crude oligoribonucleotides by anion exchange HPLC were carried out according to established procedures. Yields and concentrations were determined by UV absorption of a solution of the respective RNA at a wavelength of 260 nm using a spectral photometer (DU 640B, Beckman Coulter GmbH, Unterschleitβheim, Germany). Double stranded RNA was generated by mixing an equimolar solution of complementary strands in annealing buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8; 100 mM sodium chloride), heated in a water bath at 85-90° C. for 3 minutes and cooled to room temperature over a period of 3-4 hours. The annealed RNA solution was stored at −20° C. until use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the synthesis of 3′-cholesterol-conjugated siRNAs (herein referred to as -Chol-3′), an appropriately modified solid support is used for RNA synthesis.
