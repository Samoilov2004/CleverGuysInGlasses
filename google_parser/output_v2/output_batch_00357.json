This invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing the pyrimidine-5-carboxamide compounds and methods of using the compounds or compositions to treat a condition characterized by undesired thrombosis. The invention is also directed to methods of making the compounds described herein.\n\n\nState of the Art\n\n\n[0003] Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are responsible for the control of a variety of signal transduction processes within cells (see, e.g., Hardie and Hanks, The Protein Kinase Facts Book, I and II, Academic Press, San Diego,\n\n\nCalif, 1995). Protein kinases are thought to have evolved from a common ancestral gene due to the conservation of their structure and catalytic function. Almost all kinases contain a similar 250-300 amino acid catalytic domain. The kinases can be categorized into families by the substrates they phosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these families (see, e.g., Hanks & Hunter, (1995), FASEB J. 9:576-596; Knighton et al., (1991), Science 253:407-414; Hiles et al., (1992), Cell 70:419-429; Kunz et al., (1993), Cell 73:585-596; Garcia-Bustos et al., (1994), EMBO J. 13:2352-2361). [0004] Many diseases are associated with abnormal cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated events. These diseases include autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, \n\n bone diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies, asthma, alzheimer's disease and hormone-related diseases. As a consequence, there has been substantial efforts in medicinal chemistry to find inhibitors of protein kinases for use as therapeutic agents. [0005] Immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM)-mediated signaling has emerged as a primary event in signaling pathways responsible for human pathologies. ITAM- mediated signaling is responsible for relaying activation signals initiated at classical immune receptors such as T-cell receptors, B-cell receptors, Fc receptors in immune cells and at GPVI and FcγRIIa in platelets to downstream intracellular molecules such as syk and ZAP-70 (Underhill, D.M and Goodridge, H. S., Trends Immunol, 28:66-73, 2007).\n\n\n[0006] The binding of a ligand to an ITAM-containing receptor triggers signaling events which allows for the recruitment of proteins from a family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases called the Src family. These kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the ITAM sequence, a region with which the tandem SH2 domains on either syk or ZAP-70 interact. [0007] Syk, along with Zap-70, is a member of the syk family of protein tyrosine kinases. The interaction of syk or ZAP-70 with diphosphorylated ITAM sequences induces a conformation change in the kinases that allows for tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase itself. Phosphorylated Syk family members activate a multitude of downstream signaling pathway proteins which include Src homology 2 (SH2) domain containing leukocyte-specific phosphoprotein of 76 kDa (SLP-76), Linker of Activation of T-cells (LAT) and PLC (phospholipase C)γ2.\n\n\n[0008] Human pathologies attributed to dysfunctional ITAM-mediated signaling include autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, multiple sclerosis, hemolytic anemia, immune-thrombocytopenia purpura, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and arteriosclerosis. Interestingly, many of the above mentioned diseases are thought to occur through crosslinking of Fc receptors by antibodies which, via syk, activate a signaling cascade in mast, basophil and other immune cells that result in the release of cell mediators responsible for inflammatory reactions. The release of mediators and the production of cytokines in IgE stimulation-dependent allergic and inflammatory reactions from mast cells and basophiles can be controlled by inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of syk (Rossi, A.B. et al., J Allergy CHn Immunol, 118:749-755, 2006). In immune- thrombocytopenia, antibody bound platelets are cleared by the spleen by an Fc \n\n receptor/ITAM/syk-mediated process (Crow, A.R. et ah, Blood, 106:abstract 2165, 2005). Drug-induced thrombocytopenia, caused by heparin- platelet factor 4 immune complexes that activate platelet FcγRIIa, also involve syk signaling downstream of receptor engagement (Reilly, M.P., Blood, 98:2442-2447, 2001). [0009] Platelet agonists induce inside-out integrin signaling resulting in fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation. This initiates outside-in signaling which produces further stimulation of platelets, syk is activated during both phases of integrin signaling, and inhibition of syk is shown to inhibit platelet adhesion to immobilized proteins (Law, D. A. et ah, Blood, 93:2645-2652, 1999). Release of arachidonic acid and serotonin and platelet aggregation induced by collagen are markedly inhibited in platelets derived from syk deficient mouse (Poole, A. et ah, EMBO J., 16:2333-2341, 1997). Thus syk inhibitors may also possess anticoagulation action.\n\n\n[0010] Because of the role syk plays in Ig-induced platelet activations, it is likely to be important in arteriosclerosis and restenosis. Arteriosclerosis is a class of diseases characterized by the thickening and hardening of the arterial walls of blood vessels.\n\n\nAlthough all blood vessels are susceptible to this serious degenerative condition, the aorta and the coronary arteries serving the heart are most often affected. Arteriosclerosis is of profound clinical importance since it can increase the risk of heart attacks, myocardial infarctions, strokes, and aneurysms. [0011] The traditional treatment for arteriosclerosis includes vascular recanalization procedures for less-serious blockages and coronary bypass surgery for major blockages. A serious shortcoming of intravascular procedures is that, in a significant number of treated individuals, some or all of the treated vessels restenose {i.e., re-narrow). For example, restenosis of an atherosclerotic coronary artery after PTCA occurs in 10-50% of patients undergoing this procedure and subsequently requires either further angioplasty or a coronary artery bypass graft. Furthermore, restenosis of an atherosclerotic coronary artery after stenting occurs in 10-20% of patients undergoing this procedure and subsequently requires repeat treatments to maintain adequate blood flow through the affected artery. Restenosis generally occurs in a relatively brief time period, e.g., roughly less than six months, after treatment.\n\n\n[0012] While the exact hormonal and cellular processes promoting restenosis have not been determined, restenosis is thought to be due in part to mechanical injury to the walls of the \n\n blood vessels caused by the balloon catheter or other intravascular device. For example, the process of PTCA, in addition to opening the obstructed artery, also injures resident coronary arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In response to this injury, adhering platelets, infiltrating macrophages, leukocytes, or the smooth muscle cells themselves release cell- derived growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), with subsequent proliferation and migration of medial SMCs through the internal elastic lamina to the area of the vessel intima. Further proliferation and hyperplasia of intimal SMCs and, most significantly, production of large amounts of extracellular matrix over a period of three to six months results in the filling in and narrowing of the vascular space sufficient to significantly obstruct blood flow.\n\n\n[0013] In addition to the role syk plays in Ig-induced platelet activations, syk plays a very important role in collagen-mediated signaling. The primary adhesive protein responsible for platelet adhesion and activation is collagen. Collagen is a filamentous protein contained within the fibrotic caps of atheromas which becomes exposed to blood during plaque rupture. Collagen functions initially by binding von Willebrand factor which tethers platelets through binding platelet membrane GPIb. Collagen functions secondarily by engaging the two collagen receptors on platelets, GPVI and integrin α2βl.\n\n\n[0014] GPVI exists in platelet membranes as a complex with FcRγ, an interaction required for the expression of GPVI. Activation of FcγRIIa on platelets results in platelet shape change, secretion and thrombosis. Signaling by the GPVI/FcRγ complex is initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITAM domain of FCRγ followed by the recruitment of syk. Activation of GPVI leads to induction of multiple platelet functions including: activation of integrins α2βl to achieve firm platelet adhesion, and GP Hb-IIIa which mediates platelet aggregation and thrombosis growth; platelet secretion, allowing for the delivery of inflammatory proteins such as CD40L, RANTES and TGFβ to the vessel wall; and the expression of P-selectin which allows for the recruitment of leukocytes. Therefore, it is believed that syk inhibitors can inhibit thrombotic events mediated by platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation.\n\n\n[0015] It has been reported that the tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular protein (activation) induced by stimulation of a receptor for IgG antibody, FcγR, and the phagocytosis mediated by FcγR are considerably inhibited in macrophages derived from syk \n\n deficient mouse (Crowley, M.T. et al., J. Exp. Med., 186:1027-1039, 1997). This suggests that syk has a markedly important role in the FcγR-mediated phagocytosis of macrophages.\n\n\n[0016] It has also been reported that an antisense oligonucleotide of syk suppresses the apoptosis inhibition of eosinophils induced by GM-CSF (Yousefi, S. et al., J. E. Med., 183: 1407-1414, 1996), showing that syk is essential for the life extending signal of eosinophils caused by GM-CSF and the like. Since life extension of eosinophils is closely related to the transition of diseases into a chronic state in allergic disorders, such as asthma, syk inhibitors can also serve as therapeutic agents for chronic eosinophilic inflammation.\n\n\n[0017] Syk is important for the activation of B-cells via a B-cell antigen receptor and is involved in the phosphatidylinositol metabolism and increase in the intracellular calcium concentration caused by the antigen receptor stimulation (Hutchcroft, J E. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 267:8613-8619, 1992; and Takata, M. et al., EMBO J., 13:1341-1349, 1994). Thus, syk inhibitors may be used to control the function of B-cells and are, therefore, expected to serve as therapeutic agents for antibody-related diseases. [0018] Syk binds to a T-cell antigen receptor, quickly undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation through crosslinking of the receptor and synergistically acts upon intracellular signals mediated by Src tyrosine kinases such as Lck (Couture, C. et al., P roc. Natl. Acad. ScL USA, 91:5301-5305, 1994; and Couture, C. et al., MoI. Cell. Biol., 14:5249-5258, 1994). syk is present in mature T-cell populations, such as intraepithelial γδ T-cells and naive αβ T-cells, and has been reported to be capable of phosphorylation of multiple components of the TCR signaling cascade (Latour, S. et. al., MoI Cell Biol, 17:4434-4441, 1997). As a consequence, syk inhibitors may serve as agents for inhibiting cellular immunity mediated by T-cell antigen receptor.\n\n\n[0019] Recent comparative genomic hybridization studies have identied syk as another gene important in the pathogenesis of Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) (Chen, R. et al. Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2007 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings (Post-Meeting Edition).Vol 25, No 18S (June 20 Supplement), 2007: 8056). MCL represents 5-10% of all non-Hodgkins lymphomas and it is a difficult form of lymphoma to treat. It has the worst prognosis among the B cell lymphomas with median survival of three years. It has been reported that Syk is overexpressed in MCL (Rinaldi, A, et.al, Br. J. Haematol, 2006; 132:303-316) and that Syk mediates mTOR (mammalian target of Rapamycin) survival \n\n signals in follicular, mantel cell, Burkitt's, and diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (Leseux, L., et. al, Blood, 2006; 108:4156-4162).\n\n\n[0020] Several lines of evidence suggest that many B-cell lymphomas depend upon B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated survival signals. BCR signaling induces receptor oligomerization and phosphorylation of Igα and β immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activated motifs by SRC family kinases. ITAM phosphorylation results in the recruitment and activation of syk that initiates downstream events and amplifies the original BCR signal. Given the role of tonic BCR signaling in normal B cell and syk-dependent survival of non-Hodgkins lymphoma cell lines in vitro (Chen, L., et.al, Blood, 2006; 108:3428-3433), syk inhibition is a promising rational treatment target for certain B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (Stefania Gobessi, Luca Laurenti, Pablo Longo, Laura Carsetti, Giuseppe Leone, Dimitar G. Efremov, Constitutive activation of the protein tyrosine kinase Syk in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia B-cells, Blood, 2007, 110, Abstract 1123). Recent data shows that administration of a multikinase inhibitor which inhibits syk, may have significant clinical activity in CLL patients (Friedberg JW et al, Blood 2008; 1 12(11), Abstract 3).\n\n\n[0021] The oncogenic potential of the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) has been described in a number of different settings. Clinically, Syk over-expression is reported in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (Rinaldi, A, et.al, Br. J. Haematol, 2006; 132:303-316) and the TEL-Syk fusion protein (Translocated ETS Leukemia) generated by a chromosomal translocation (t(9; 12)(q22;pl2)) leads to increased Syk activity and is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (Kuno, Y., et.al, Blood, 2001; 97: 1050-1055). Leukemia is induced in mice by adoptively transferring bone marrow cells that express human TEL-Syk (Wossning, T., JEM, 2006; 203:2829-2840). Further, in mouse primary bone marrow cells, over-expression of Syk results in IL-7 independent growth in culture (Wossning, T., et.al, JEM, 2006; 203:2829- 2840).\n\n\n[0022] Interestingly, Syk signaling appears to be required for B-cell development and survival in humans and mouse. Inducible loss of the B-cell receptor (Lam, K., et.al, Cell, 1997; 90: 1073-1083) or Igα (Kraus, M., et.al, Cell, 2004; 117:787-800) results in loss of peripheral B-cells in mice. Over-expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-RO, which is known to negatively regulate Syk activity, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in cell lines derived from non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (Chen, L., et.al, Blood, 2006; \n\n 108:3428-3433). Finally, B-cell lymphomas rarely exhibit loss of BCR expression, and antiidiotype therapy rarely leads to resistance (Kuppers, R. Nat Rev Cancer, 2005; 5:251-262).\n\n\n[0023] Engagement of the antigen-specific B cell receptor (BCR) activates multiple signaling pathways that ultimately regulate the cells activation status, promoting survival and clonal expansion. Signaling through the BCR is made possible by its association with two other members of the immunoglobulin super-family; Igα and Igβ, each bearing an immuno- tyrosine based activation motif (ITAM) (Jumaa, Hendriks et al. Annu Rev Immunol 23: 415- 45 (2005). The ITAM domain is directly phosphorylated by Src family kinases in response to BCR engagement. The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) docks with and phosphorylates the ITAM, a process that enhances its kinase activity, resulting in Syk autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple downstream substrates (Rolli, Gallwitz et al. MoI Cell 10(5): 1057-69 (2002). This signaling pathway is active in B cells beginning at the transition from pro- to pre-B cell stage of development, when the newly formed pre-BCR is expressed. In fact, B cell development arrests at the pro-B cell stage in Syk knockout mice (Cheng, Rowley et al. 1995; Turner, Mee et al. Nature 378(6554): 303-6 (1995). Inducible loss of the B cell receptor (Lam, Kuhn et al. Cell 90(6): 1073-83 (1997) or Igα (Kraus, Alimzhanov et al. Cell 117(6): 787-800 (2004) results in loss of peripheral B cells in mice. Human B cells also appear to require Syk for proliferation and survival. Over-expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-RO, a negative regulator of Syk activity, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in cell lines derived from non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) (Chen, Juszczynski et al. Blood 108(10): 3428-33 (2006). Knock down of Syk by siRNA in the NHL line SUDHL-4 led to a block in the Gl/S transition of the cell cycle (Gururajan, Dasu et al. J Immunol 178(1): 1 1 1-21 (2007). Together, these data suggest that Syk signaling is required for the development, proliferation, and even survival of human and mouse B cells. [0024] Conversely, the oncogenic potential of Syk has been described in a number of different settings. Clinically, Syk over-expression is reported in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (Rinaldi, Kwee et al. Br J Haematol 132(3): 303-16 (2006) and the TEL-Syk fusion protein (Translocated ETS Leukemia) generated by a chromosomal translocation (t(9;12)(q22;pl2)) leads to increased Syk activity and is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (Kuno, Abe et al. Blood 97(4): 1050-5 (2001). Leukemia is induced in mice by the adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells that express human TEL-Syk (Wossning, Herzog et al. J Exp Med 203(13): 2829-40 (2006). Further, in mouse primary bone marrow cells, over-expression of Syk results in IL-7 independent growth in culture (Wossning, Herzog et al. 2006). \n\n Consistently, Syk was reported to mediate mTOR (mammalian target of Rapamycin) survival signals in follicular, mantle cell, Burkitt's, and diffuse large B-cell NHL (Leseux, Hamdi et al. Blood 108(13): 4156-62 (2006). Additional recent studies also suggest that Syk- dependant survival signals may play a role in B-cell malignancies, including DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma (Gururajan, Jennings et al. 2006; Irish, Czerwinski et al. J Immunol 176(10): 5715-9 (2006). Given the role of tonic BCR signaling in normal B cells and Syk-dependent survival of NHL cell lines in vitro, the specific inhibition of Syk may prove promising for the treatment of certain B-cell lymphomas.\n\n\n[0025] Recently, R406 (Rigel Pharmaceuticals) was reported to inhibit ITAM signaling in response to various stimuli, including FcεRl and BCR induced Syk activation (Braselmann, Taylor et al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther 319(3): 998-1008( 2006). Interestingly, this ATP- competitive inhibitor of Syk was also active against Flt3, cKit, and JAK kinases, but not against Src kinsase (Braselmann, Taylor et al. 2006). Activating mutations to Flt3 are associated with AML and inhibition of this kinase is currently under clinical development (Burnett and Knapper Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program 2007: 429-34 (2007).\n\n\nOver-activation of the tyrosine kinase cKit is also associated with hematologic malignancies, and a target for cancer therapy (Heinrich, Griffith et al. Blood 96(3): 925-32 (2000). Similarly, JAK3 signaling is implicated in leukemias and lymphomas, and is currently exploited as a potential therapeutic target (Heinrich, Griffith et al. 2000). Importantly, the multi-kinase inhibitory activity of R406 attenuates BCR signaling in lymphoma cell lines and primary human lymphoma samples, resulting in apoptosis of the former (Chen, Monti et al. Blood 1 11(4): 2230-7 (2008). Further, a phase II clinical trial reported favorable results by this compound in refractory NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Friedberg JW et al, Blood 2008; 112(1 1), Abstract 3). Although the precise mechanism of action is unclear for R406, the data suggest that inhibition of kinases that mediate survival signaling in lymphocytes is clinically beneficial.\n\n\n[0026] Additional recent studies also suggest that syk-dependant survival signals may play a role in B-cell malignancies, including DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma (see e.g., S. Linfengshen et al. Blood, Feb. 2008; 111: 2230-2237; J. M. Irish et al. Blood, 2006; 108: 3135-3142; A. Renaldi et al. Brit J. Haematology, 2006; 132: 303-316; M. Guruoajan et al. J. Immunol, 2006; 176: 5715-5719; L. Laseux et al. Blood, 2006; 108: 4156- 4162. \n\n [0027] JAK kinases (Janus Kinases) are a family of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases including JAKl, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. The JAKs play a crucial role in cytokine signaling. Each of the JAK kinases is selective for the receptors of certain cytokines, though multiple JAK kinases can be affected by particular cytokine or signaling pathways. Studies suggest that J AK3 associates with the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (Fcγ or γc) of the various cytokine receptors. JAK3 in particular selectively binds to receptors and is part of the cytokine signaling pathway for and activated by IL-2, IL-4, JL-I, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21. JAKl interacts with, among others, the receptors for cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL- 21, while JAK2 interacts with, among others, the receptors for IL-9 and TNF-α. Upon the binding of certain cytokines to their receptors (e.g., LL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21), receptor oligomerization occurs, resulting in the cytoplasmic tails of associated JAK kinases being brought into proximity and facilitating the trans-phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the JAK kinase. This trans-phosphorylation results in the activation of the JAK kinase.\n\n\n[0028] The downstream substrates of JAK family kinases include the signal tranducer activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Phosphorylated JAK kinases bind various STAT (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) proteins. STAT proteins, which are DNA binding proteins activated by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, function both as signaling molecules and transcription factors and ultimately bind to specific DNA sequences present in the promoters of cytokine-responsive genes (Leonard et ah, (2000), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 105:877-888).\n\n\n[0029] JAK/STAT signaling has been implicated in the mediation of many abnormal immune responses such as allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases such as transplant (allograft) rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, as well as in solid and hematologic malignancies such as leukemia and lymphomas. For a review of the pharmaceutical intervention of the JAK/STAT pathway see Frank, (1999), MoI. Med. 5:432:456 and Seidel et ah, (2000), Oncogene 19:2645-2656.\n\n\n[0030] JAK3 in particular has been implicated in a variety of biological processes. For example, the proliferation and survival of murine mast cells induced by IL-4 and IL-9 have been shown to be dependent on JAK3- and gamma chain-signaling (Suzuki et ah, (2000), Blood 96:2172-2180). JAK3 also plays a crucial role in IgE receptor-mediated mast cell degranulation responses (Malaviya et ah, (1999), Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 257:807-813), and inhibition of JAK3 kinase has been shown to prevent type I \n\n hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis (Malaviya et al., (1999), J. Biol. Chem. 274:27028-27038). JAK3 inhibition has also been shown to result in immune suppression for allograft rejection (Kirken, (2001), Transpl. Proc. 33:3268-3270). JAK3 kinases have also been implicated in the mechanism involved in early and late stages of rheumatoid arthritis (Muller-Ladner et al., (2000), J. Immunal. 164:3894-3901); familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Trieu et al., (2000), Biochem Biophys. Res. Commun. 267:22-25); leukemia (Sudbeck et al., (1999), Clin. Cancer Res. 5: 1569-1582); mycosis fungoides, a form of T-cell lymphoma (Nielsen et al., (1997), Prac. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:6764-6769); and abnormal cell growth (Yu et al., (1997), J. Immunol. 159:5206-5210; Catlett-Falcone et al., (1999), Immunity 10: 105-115).\n\n\n[0031] JAKl, JAK2, and TYK2 are expressed ubiquitously, whereas JAK3 is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells. The JAK kinases, including JAK3, are abundantly expressed in primary leukemic cells from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood cancer, and studies have correlated STAT activation in certain cells with signals regulating apoptosis (Demoulin et al., (1996), MoI. Cell. Biol. 16:4710-6; Jurlander et al., (1997), Blood. 89:4146-52; Kaneko et al., (1997), Clin. Exp. Immun. 109: 185-193; and Nakamura et al.,(1996), J. Biol. Chem. 271: 19483-8). They are also known to be important for lymphocyte differentiation, function and survival. JAK-3 in particular plays an essential role in the function of lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells. Given the importance of this JAK kinase, compounds which modulate the JAK pathway, including those selective for JAK3, can be useful for treating diseases or conditions where the function of lymphocytes, macrophages, or mast cells is involved (Kudlacz et al., (2004) Am. J. Transplant 4:51-57; Changelian (2003) Science 302:875-878). Conditions in which targeting of the JAK pathway or modulation of the JAK kinases, particularly JAK3, are contemplated to be therapeutically useful include, leukemia, lymphoma, transplant rejection (e.g., pancreas islet transplant rejection, bone marrow transplant applications (e.g., graft- versus-host disease), autoimmune diseases (e.g., diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriasis), and inflammation (e.g., asthma, allergic reactions). Conditions which can benefit from JAK3 inhibition are discussed in greater detail below. Recent data on JAK inhibition has been reported in kidney allograft patients treated with CP-690,550 and showed that markers of allogeneic response (interferon gamma) can be reduced (Van Gurp EA et al (2009) Transplanatation 87:79-86). \n\n [0032] In view of the numerous conditions that are contemplated to benefit by treatment involving modulation of the JAK pathway it is immediately apparent that new compounds that modulate JAK pathways and methods of using these compounds should provide substantial therapeutic benefits to a wide variety of patients. Provided herein are novel 2,4- pyrimidinediamine compounds for use in the treatment of conditions in which targeting of the JAK pathway or inhibition of JAK kinases, particularly JAK3, are therapeutically useful.\n\n\n[0033] Patents and patent applications related to modulation of the JAK pathway include: U.S. Pat.

Thus, in one embodiment, methods are disclosed which include the administration of an effective amount of a compound of formula (I), typically in the form of a pharmaceutical composition, to a subject in need thereof.\n\n\n[0039] The conditions associated with cardiovascular disease is selected from the group consisting of acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, refractory angina, occlusive coronary thrombosis occurring post-thrombolytic therapy or post-coronary angioplasty, a thrombotically mediated cerebrovascular syndrome, embolic stroke, thrombotic stroke, transient ischemic attacks, venous thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, coagulopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, thromboangiitis obliterans, thrombotic disease associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic complications associated with extracorporeal circulation, thrombotic complications associated with instrumentation such as cardiac or other intravascular catheterization, intra-aortic balloon pump, coronary stent or cardiac valve, and conditions requiring the fitting of prosthetic devices.\n\n\n[0040] The present invention also provides a method for inhibiting the syk activity of a blood sample comprising contacting said sample with a compound of the present invention.\n\n\n[0041] The present invention further provides compounds in purified forms, as well as chemical intermediates.\n\n\n[0042] These and other aspects, objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent upon reference to the following detailed description and figures. To this end, various references are set forth herein which describe in more detail certain background information, procedures, compounds and/or compositions, and are each hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. \n\n BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\n\n[0043] Figure 1 shows how Syk serves as a key mediator of Fc receptor mediated signaling in cellular biology and multiple diseases.\n\n\n[0044] Figure 2 shows how gene targeting of Syk indicated that Syk serves as a key mediator in arterial platelet biology and a selective target for treating arterial thrombosis.\n\n\n[0045] Figure 3 shows a general synthesis of compounds of the present invention.\n\n\n[0046] Figure 4 provides table 1 illustrating compounds of the present invention and syk IC\n50\nS.\n\n\n[0047] Figure 5 provides table 2 illustrating compounds of the present invention and syk IC\n50\nS.\n\n\n[0048] Figure 6 provides table 3 illustrating compounds of the present invention and syk\n\n\nIC\n50\nS.\n\n\n[0049] Figure 7A and B provide tables 4A and 4B illustrating compounds of the present invention and syk IC\n5\noS. [0050] Figure 8 shows a series of compounds that were indentied to selectively inhibit Syk in purified kinase assays. Figure 8A) Compounds from the Syk-specific series (P459-72 and P505-15) and multi-kinase series (example 100b) were screened at 30OnM against the Millipore purified kinase panel (270 kinases tested with lOμM ATP) to determine potency and selectivity for Syk. Data are represented as a heat-map, defined at the bottom. Figure 8B) Subset of the purified kinases that had >80% inhibition by any of the three compounds. P459-72 only inhibited Syk and MLKl. P505-15 at 5OnM (~10x greater than its Syk IC50) only inhibited Syk. Example 100b inhibited multiple kinases, including Syk, JAK2 and JAK3. The IC50 of Syk inhibition is reported for each compound on the left of the heat map. Percent kinase inhibition is given in each panel within the heat-map. [0051] Figure 9 shows the selective inhibition of Syk in non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma cell lines. B cells were stimulated with anti-BCR antibody in the presence of the indicated concentrations of Syk specific inhibitors P459-72 and P505-15 (Figure 9A and Figure 9B) or the dual Syk/JAK inhibitor example 100b (Figure 9C). Western blot analyses of whole cell lysates were then performed to evaluate Syk kinase activity (pBLNK Y84 and total BLNK; top two gels) and Src kinase activity (pSyk Y352 and total Syk; bottom two gels). \n\n Experiments were performed 2-3 times each, bar graphs represent mean ± S. D. of pBLNK Y84. The calculated IC50s of Syk kinase inhibition are presented above the graphs.\n\n\n[0052] Figure 10 provides a comparison of Syk-Specific and Dual Syk/JAK Inhibition in NHL Cell Lines. B cells were stimulated with anti-BCR (Figure 10A), or IL-4 (Figure 10B) for 15min in the presence of various concentrations of each inhibitor, as indicated. Cells were then evaluated for inhibition of signaling pathways by phospho-flow cytometry. Figure 10A) bar graphs (mean ± S. D., n=3) representing Src activity (pSyk Y352 MFI) and Syk activity (pERK Y204 MFI) following BCR stimulation under the various treatment conditions. Figure 10B) Bar graphs depicting pSTAT-6 Y641 MFI (mean ± S.D., n=3) following stimulation with IL-4 in the presence of various concentrations of each inhibitor, as indicated.\n\n\n[0053] Figure 11 shows how Syk-specific inhibitors disrupt proliferation and survival of and induces apoptosis in NHL cell lines . The Syk-dependent \"BCR type\" and Syk- independent \"non-BCR type\" NHL cell lines were previously described (Polo, Juszczynski et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 104(9): 3207-12 (2007). Figure HA) Cells were treated for 72h with 1 and 3μM of the Syk-specific inhibitor P505-15. Apoptosis was determined by FACS analysis of active caspase 3; data is represented as histograms. Figure HB) Additional cell lines were tested for sensitivity to Syk specific (P459-72 and P505-15) versus dual Syk/JAK (example 100b) inhibition. Bar graphs represent mean ± S. D. (n=3) of the percent of caspase 3 positive cells following each condition.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n[0054] As used herein, the below terms have the following meanings unless specified otherwise:\n\n\n1.

For example, \"Ci-salkyl\" refers to a hydrocarbon radical straight or \n\n branched, containing from 1 to 8 carbon atoms that is derived by the removal of one hydrogen atom from a single carbon atom of a parent alkane. The phrase \"unsubstituted alkyl\" refers to alkyl groups that do not contain groups other than fully saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radicals. Thus the phrase includes straight chain alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl and the like. The phrase also includes branched chain isomers of straight chain alkyl groups such as isopropyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, and the like.

Further representative alkyl groups include straight and branched chain alkyl groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 carbon atoms.\n\n\n[0058] \"Alkenyl\" by itself or as part of another substituent refers to a straight or branched chain, which may be mono- or polyunsaturated, having the number of carbon atoms designated. For example, \"C\n2\n-C\n8\n alkenyl\" means an alkenyl radical having from 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 atoms that is derived by the removal of one hydrogen atom from a single carbon atom of a parent alkane. Examples include, but are not limited to vinyl, 2-propenyl i.e. -\n\n\nCH=C(H)(CH\n3\n), -CH=C(CH\n3\n)\n2\n, -C(CH\n3\n)=C(H)\n2\n, -C(CH\n3\n)=C(H)(CH\n3\n), -C(CH\n2\nCH\n3\n)=CH\n2\n, butadienyl e.g. 2-(butadienyl), pentadienyl e.g. 2,4-pentadienyl and 3-(l,4-pentadienyl), and hexadienyl, among others, and higher homologs and stereoisomers thereof. A \"substituted\" alkenyl group includes alkenyl groups in which a non-carbon or non-hydrogen atom is bonded to a carbon double bonded to another carbon and those in which one of the non- carbon or non-hydrogen atoms is bonded to a carbon not involved in a double bond to another carbon. Each site of unsaturation may be either cis or trans configuration about the double bond(s).\n\n\n[0059] The term \"alkynyl\", by itself or as part of another substituent, means a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radical, which may be mono- or polyunsaturated, having the number of carbon atoms designated. For example, \"C\n2\n-C\n8\n alkynyl\" means an alkynyl radical having from 2 to 8 carbon atoms that is derived by the removal of one hydrogen atom from a single carbon atom of a parent alkane. \"Unsubstituted alkynyl\" refers to straight and branched chain groups such as those described with respect to unsubstituted alkyl groups as defined above, except that at least one triple bond exists between two carbon atoms.\n\n\nExamples include, but are not limited to ethynyl e.g. -C≡C(H), 1- propynyl e.g. -C≡C(CH\n3\n), -C=C(CH\n2\nCH\n3\n), -C(H\n2\n)C≡C(H), -C(H)\n2\nC=C(CH\n3\n), and -C(H)\n2\nC≡C(CH\n2\nCH\n3\n) among others, and higher homologs and isomers thereof. A \"substituted\" alkynyl group includes \n\n alkynyl groups in which a non-carbon or non-hydrogen atom is bonded to a carbon triple bonded to another carbon and those in which a non-carbon or non-hydrogen atom is bonded to a carbon not involved in a triple bond to another carbon.\n\n\n[0060] \"Alkylene\" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from an alkane, as exemplified by -CH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\nCH\n2\n-. Typically, an alkylene group will have from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 carbon atoms that is derived by the removal of one hydrogen atom from a single carbon atom of a parent alkyl.\n\n\n[0061] \"Cycloalkyl\" or \"carbocycle\", by themselves or in combination with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of \"alkyl\", \"alkenyl\" and \"alkynyl\" in which all ring atoms are carbon. \"Cycloalkyl\" or \"carbocycle\" refers to a mono- or polycyclic group. When used in connection with cycloalkyl substituents, the term \"polycyclic\" refers herein to fused and non-fused alkyl cyclic structures. \"Cycloalkyl\" or \"carbocycle\" may form a bridged ring or a spiro ring. The cycloalkyl group may have one or more double or triple bond(s). The term \"cycloalkenyl\" refers to a cycloalkyl group that has at least one site of alkenyl unsaturation between the ring vertices. The term \"cycloalkynyl\" refers to a cycloalkyl group that has at least one site of alkynyl unsaturation between the ring vertices. When \"cycloalkyl\" is used in combination with \"alkyl\", as in C\n3\n.\n8\ncycloalkylC\n3-8\nalkylene-, the cycloalkyl portion is meant to have the stated number of carbon atoms (e.g., from three to eight carbon atoms), while the alkylene portion has from one to eight carbon atoms. Typical cycloalkyl substituents have from 3 to 8 ring atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl include cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like.\n\n\n[0062] \"Aryl\" by itself or as part of another substituent refers to a polyunsaturated, aromatic, hydrocarbon group containing from 6 to 14 carbon atoms, which can be a single ring or multiple rings (up to three rings) which are fused together or linked covalently. Thus the phrase includes, but is not limited to, groups such as phenyl, biphenyl, anthracenyl, naphthyl by way of example. Non-limiting examples of unsubstituted aryl groups include phenyl, 1 -naphthyl, 2-naphthyl and 4-biphenyl. \"Substituted aryl group\" includes, for example, -CH2OH (one carbon atom and one heteroatom replacing a carbon atom) and -CH2SH. The term \"heteroalkylene\" by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified by -CH2-CH2-S-CH2CH2- - and -CH2-S-CH2-CH2-NH-CH2- For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either \n\n or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied.\n\n\n[0063] The terms \"heterocycle\", \"heterocyclyl\" or \"heterocyclic\" refer to a saturated or unsaturated non-aromatic cyclic group containing at least one heteroatom. As used herein, the term \"heteroatom\" is meant to include oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S) and silicon (Si). Each heterocycle can be attached at any available ring carbon or heteroatom. Each heterocycle may have one or more rings. When multiple rings are present, they can be fused together or linked covalently. Each heterocycle typically contains 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, independently selected heteroatoms. Preferably, these groups contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 carbon atoms, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 nitrogen atoms, 0, 1 or 2 sulfur atoms and 0, 1 or 2 oxygen atoms. More preferably, these groups contain 1, 2 or 3 nitrogen atoms, 0-1 sulfur atoms and 0-1 oxygen atoms. Non-limiting examples of heterocycle groups include morpholin-3-one, piperazine-2-one, piperazin-1 -oxide, pyridine-2-one, piperidine, morpholine, piperazine, isoxazoline, pyrazoline, imidazoline, pyrazol-5-one, pyrrolidine-2,5- dione, imidazolidine-2,4-dione, pyrrolidine, tetrahydroquinolinyl, decahydroquinolinyl, tetrahydrobenzooxazepinyl dihydrodibenzooxepin and the like.\n\n\n[0064] \"Heteroaryl\" refers to a cyclic or polycyclic aromatic radical that contain from one to five heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S, wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms are optionally oxidized, and the nitrogen atom(s) are optionally quaternized. A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom or through a carbon atom and can contain 5 to 10 carbon atoms.

Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed \"stereoisomers\". \"Stereoisomer\" and \"stereoisomers\" refer to compounds that exist in different stereoisomeric forms if they possess one or more asymmetric centers or a double bond with asymmetric substitution and, therefore, can be produced as individual stereoisomers or as mixtures. Stereoisomers include enantiomers and diastereomers. Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed \"diastereomers\" and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed \"enantiomers\". When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (-)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a \"racemic mixture\". Unless otherwise indicated, the description is intended to include individual stereoisomers as well as mixtures. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art (see discussion in Chapter 4 of ADVANCED ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 4th edition J. March, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1992) differ in the chirality of one or more stereocenters.\n\n\n[0167] \"Thioacyl\" refers to the groups R\na\n-C(S)-. [0168] \"Thiol\" refers to the group -SH. \n\n [0169] \"Tautomer\" refers to alternate forms of a molecule that differ in the position of a proton, such as enol-keto and imine-enamine tautomers, or the tautomeric forms of heteroaryl groups containing a -N=C(H)-NH- ring atom arrangement, such as pyrazoles, imidazoles, benzimidazoles, triazoles, and tetrazoles. A person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that other tautomeric ring atom arrangements are possible.\n\n\n[0170] It is understood that in all substituted groups defined above, polymers arrived at by defining substituents with further substituents to themselves (e.g., substituted aryl having a substituted aryl group as a substituent which is itself substituted with a substituted aryl group, which is further substituted by a substituted aryl group, etc.) are not intended for inclusion herein. In such cases, the maximum number of such substitutions is three. For example, serial substitutions of substituted aryl groups are limited to -substituted aryl-(substituted aryl)- substituted aryl.\n\n\n[0171] \"Protecting group\" refers to a group of atoms that, when attached to a reactive functional group in a molecule, mask, reduce or prevent the reactivity of the functional group. Typically, a protecting group may be selectively removed as desired during the course of a synthesis. Examples of protecting groups can be found in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, 3\nrd\n Ed., 1999, John Wiley & Sons, NY and Harrison et al., Compendium of Synthetic Organic Methods, VoIs. 1-8, 1971-1996, John Wiley & Sons, NY. Representative amino protecting groups include, but are not limited to, formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (\"CBZ\"), tert-butoxycarbonyl (\"Boc\"), trimethylsilyl (\"TMS\"), 2-trimethylsilyl-ethanesulfonyl (\"TES\"), trityl and substituted trityl groups, allyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (\"FMOC\"), nitro- veratryloxycarbonyl (\"NVOC\") and the like. Representative hydroxy protecting groups include, but are not limited to, those where the hydroxy group is either acylated or alkylated such as benzyl and trityl ethers, as well as alkyl ethers, tetrahydropyranyl ethers, trialkylsilyl ethers (e.g., TMS or TIPPS groups) and allyl ethers.\n\n\n[0172] The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salts\" is meant to include salts of the active compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of salts derived from \n\n pharmaceutical! y-acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically-acceptable organic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including substituted amines, cyclic amines, naturally- occurring amines and the like, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N'- dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, e.g., Berge, S. M. et al., \"Pharmaceutical Salts,\" Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66: 1-19, 1977). Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts. [0173] The neutral forms of the compounds may be regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the present invention. [0174] In addition to salt forms, the present invention provides compounds which are in a prodrug ester form. \"Prodrug\"s of the compounds described herein are those compounds that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present invention. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the \n\n present invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present invention when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent. Prodrugs are frequently, but not necessarily, pharmacologically inactive until converted into the active drug. Prodrugs are typically obtained by masking a functional group in the drug believed to be in part required for activity with a progroup (defined below) to form a promoiety which undergoes a transformation, such as cleavage, under the specified conditions of use to release the functional group, and hence the active drug. The cleavage of the promoiety may proceed spontaneously, such as by way of a hydrolysis reaction, or it may be catalyzed or induced by another agent, such as by an enzyme, by light, by acid or base, or by a change of or exposure to a physical or environmental parameter, such as a change of temperature. The agent may be endogenous to the conditions of use, such as an enzyme present in the cells to which the prodrug is administered or the acidic conditions of the stomach, or it may be supplied exogenously. [0175] \"Progroup\" refers to a type of protecting group that, when used to mask a functional group within an active drug to form a promoiety, converts the drug into a prodrug. Progroups are typically attached to the functional group of the drug via bonds that are cleavable under specified conditions of use. Thus, a progroup is that portion of a promoiety that cleaves to release the functional group under the specified conditions of use. As a specific example, an amide promoiety of the formula -NH-C(O)CH\n3\n comprises the progroup -C(O)CH\n3\n.\n\n\n[0176] A wide variety of progroups, as well as the resultant promoieties, suitable for masking functional groups in the active syk and/or JAK selective inhibitory compounds to yield prodrugs are well-known in the art. For example, a hydroxyl functional group may be masked as a sulfonate, ester (such as acetate or maleate) or carbonate promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the hydroxyl group. An amino functional group may be masked as an amide, carbamate, imine, urea, phosphenyl, phosphoryl or sulfenyl promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the amino group. A carboxyl group may be masked as an ester (including methyl, ethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, silyl esters and thioesters), amide or hydrazide promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the carboxyl group. The invention includes those esters and acyl groups known in the art for modifying the solubility or hydrolysis characteristics for use as sustained-release or prodrug formulations. Other specific examples of suitable progroups and their respective promoieties will be apparent to those of skill in the art. \n\n [0177] Certain compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. \"Solvate\" refers to a complex formed by combination of solvent molecules with molecules or ions of the solute. The solvent can be an organic compound, an inorganic compound, or a mixture of both. Some examples of solvents include, but are not limited to, methanol, N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfoxide, and water. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms. In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present invention and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n[0178] Certain compounds of the present invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers, regioisomers and individual isomers (e.g., separate enantiomers) are all intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. These isomers can be resolved or asymmetrically synthesized using conventional methods to render the isomers \"optically pure\", i.e., substantially free of its other isomers. If, for instance, a particular enantiomer of a compound of the present invention is desired, it may be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, or by derivation with a chrial auxilliary, where the resulting diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxilliary group cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic functional group, such as amino, or an acidic functional group, such as carboxyl, diastereomeric salts are formed with an appropriate optically-active acid or base, followed by resolution of the diasteromers thus formed by fractional crystallization or chromatagraphic means well known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantiomers. [0179] The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (\n3\nH), iodine-125 (\n125\nI) or carbon-14 (\n14\nC). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n[0180] The term \"administering\" refers to oral administration, administration as a suppository, topical contact, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intralesional, \n\n intranasal or subcutaneous administration, or the implantation of a slow-release device e.g., a mini-osmotic pump, to a subject. Adminsitration is by any route, including parenteral and transmucosal (e.g., buccal, sublingual, palatal, gingival, nasal, vaginal, rectal, or transdermal). Parenteral administration includes, e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, intra- arteriole, intradermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intraventricular, and intracranial. Other modes of delivery include, but are not limited to, the use of liposomal formulations, intravenous infusion, transdermal patches, etc.\n\n\n[0181] An \"agonist\" or \"activator\" refers to an agent or molecule that binds to a receptor of the invention, stimulates, increases, opens, activates, facilitates, enhances activation or enzymatic activity, sensitizes or up regulates the activity of a receptor of the invention.\n\n\n[0182] An \"antagonist\" or \"inhibitor\" refers to an agent or molecule that inhibits or binds to, partially or totally blocks stimulation or activity, decreases, closes, prevents, delays activation or enzymatic activity, inactivates, desensitizes, or down regulates the activity of a receptor of the invention. As used herein, \"antagonist\" also includes a reverse or inverse agonist.\n\n\n[0183] As used herein, the term \"condition or disorder responsive to modulation of syk and/or JAK \" and related terms and phrases refer to a condition or disorder associated with inappropriate, e.g., less than or greater than normal, activity of syk and/or JAK and at least partially responsive to or affected by modulation of syk and/or JAK (e.g., syk and/or JAK antagonist or agonist results in some improvement in patient well-being in at least some patients). Inappropriate functional activity of syk and/or JAK might arise as the result of expression of syk and/or JAK in cells which normally do not express the receptor, greater than normal production of syk and/or JAK, or slower than normal metabolic inactivation or elimination of syk and/or JAK or its active metabolites, increased expression of syk and/or JAK or degree of intracellular activation (leading to, e.g., inflammatory and immune-related disorders and conditions) or decreased expression of syk and/or JAK. A condition or disorder associated with syk and/or JAK may include a \" syk and/or JAK -mediated condition or disorder\".\n\n\n[0184] As used herein, the phrases \"a condition or disorder mediated at least in part by syk or JAK kinase activity\", and related phrases and terms refer to a condition or disorder characterized by inappropriate, e.g., greater than normal, syk and/or JAK activity. Inappropriate syk and/or JAK functional activity might arise as the result of syk and/or JAK \n\n expression in cells which normally do not express syk and/or JAK or increased syk and/or JAK expression or degree of intracellular activation (leading to, e.g., inflammatory and immune-related disorders and conditions). A condition or disorder mediated at least in part by syk or JAK kinase activity may be completely or partially mediated by inappropriate syk and/or JAK functional activity. However, a condition or disorder mediated at least in part by syk or JAK kinase activity is one in which modulation of syk and/or JAK results in some effect on the underlying condition or disorder (e.g., an syk and/or JAK antagonist results in some improvement in patient well-being in at least some patients).\n\n\n[0185] The term \"inflammation\" as used herein refers to infiltration of white blood cells (e.g., leukocytes, monocytes, etc.) into the area being treated for restenosis.\n\n\n[0186] The term \"intervention\" refers to an action that produces an effect or that is intended to alter the course of a disease process. For example, \"vascular intervention\" refers to the use of an intravascular procedure such as angioplasty or a stent to open an obstructed blood vessel. [0187] The term \"intravascular device\" refers to a device useful for a vascular recanalization procedure to restore blood flow through an obstructed blood vessel. Examples of intravascular devices include, without limitation, stents, balloon catheters, autologous venous/arterial grafts, prosthetic venous/arterial grafts, vascular catheters, and vascular shunts. [0188] As used herein, the term \"JAK\" refers to a Janus kinase (RefSeq Accession No. P- 43408) or a variant thereof that is capable of mediating gene expression in vitro or in vivo. JAK variants include proteins substantially homologous to native JAK, i.e., proteins having one or more naturally or non-naturally occurring amino acid deletions, insertions or substitutions (e.g., JAK derivatives, homologs and fragments). The amino acid sequence of JAK variant preferably is at least about 80% identical to a native JAK, more preferably at least about 90% identical, and most preferably at least about 95% identical.\n\n\n[0189] The term \"leukocyte\" refers to any of the various blood cells that have a nucleus and cytoplasm, separate into a thin white layer when whole blood is centrifuged, and help protect the body from infection and disease. Examples of leukocytes include, without limitation, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. \n\n [0190] The term \"mammal\" includes, without limitation, humans, domestic animals (e.g., dogs or cats), farm animals (cows, horses, or pigs), monkeys, rabbits, mice, and laboratory animals.\n\n\n[0191] The terms \"modulate\", \"modulation\" and the like refer to the ability of a compound to increase or decrease the function and/or expression of syk and/or JAK, where such function may include transcription regulatory activity and/or protein-binding. Modulation may occur in vitro or in vivo. Modulation, as described herein, includes the inhibition, antagonism, partial antagonism, activation, agonism or partial agonism of a function or characteristic associated with syk and/or JAK, either directly or indirectly, and/or the upregulation or downregulation of the expression of syk and/or JAK, either directly or indirectly. In a preferred embodiment, the modulation is direct. Inhibitors or antagonists are compounds that, e.g., bind to, partially or totally block stimulation, decrease, prevent, inhibit, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or downregulate signal transduction. Activators or agonists are compounds that, e.g., bind to, stimulate, increase, open, activate, facilitate, enhance activation, activate, sensitize or upregulate signal transduction. The ability of a compound to inhibit the function of syk and/or JAK can be demonstrated in a biochemical assay, e.g., binding assay, or a cell-based assay, e.g., a transient transfection assay.\n\n\n[0192] \"Modulators\" of activity are used to refer to \"ligands\", \"antagonists\" and \"agonists\" identified using in vitro and in vivo assays for activity and their homologs and mimetics. Modulators include naturally occurring and synthetic ligands, antagonists, agonists, molecules and the like. Assays to identify antagonists and agonists include, e.g., applying putative modulator compounds to cells, in the presence or absence of a receptor of the invention and then determining the functional effects on a receptor of the invention activity. Samples or assays comprising a receptor of the invention that are treated with a potential activator, inhibitor, or modulator are compared to control samples without the inhibitor, activator, or modulator to examine the extent of effect. Control samples (untreated with modulators) are assigned a relative activity value of 100%. Inhibition is achieved when the activity value of a receptor of the invention relative to the control is about 80%, optionally 50% or 25-1%. Activation is achieved when the activity value of a receptor of the invention relative to the control is 110%, optionally 150%, optionally 200-500%, or 1000-3000% higher. \n\n [0193] \"Patient\" refers to human and non-human animals, especially mammals. Examples of patients include, but are not limited to, humans, cows, dogs, cats, goats, sheep, pigs and rabbits.\n\n\n[0194] Turning next to the compositions of the invention, the term \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient\" means a carrier or excipient that is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes a carrier or excipient that is acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. A \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient\" as used in the specification and claims includes both one and more than one such carrier or excipient.\n\n\n[0195] The terms \"pharmaceutically effective amount\", \"therapeutically effective amount\" or \"therapeutically effective dose\" refers to the amount of the subject compound that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The term \"therapeutically effective amount\" includes that amount of a compound that, when administered, is sufficient to prevent development of, or alleviate to some extent, one or more of the symptoms of the condition or disorder being treated. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending on the compound, the disorder or condition and its severity and the age, weight, etc., of the mammal to be treated. [0196] The term \"platelet\" refers to a minute, nonnucleated, disklike cell found in the blood plasma of mammals that functions to promote blood clotting.\n\n\n[0197] The terms \"prevent\", \"preventing\", \"prevention\" and grammatical variations thereof as used herein, refers to a method of partially or completely delaying or precluding the onset or recurrence of a disorder or condition and/or one or more of its attendant symptoms or barring a subject from acquiring or reacquiring a disorder or condition or reducing a subject's risk of acquiring or reaquiring a disorder or condition or one or more of its attendant symptoms.\n\n\n[0198] The term \"recanalization\" refers to the process of restoring flow to or reuniting an interrupted channel of the body, such as a blood vessel. [0199] The term \"restenosis\" refers to a re-narrowing or blockage of an artery at the same site where treatment, such as an angioplasty or a stent procedure, has been performed. \n\n [0200] The phrase \"selectively\" or \"specifically\" when referring to binding to a receptor, refers to a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the receptor, often in a heterogeneous population of receptors and other biologies. Thus, under designated conditions, the compounds bind to a particular receptor at least two times the background and more typically more than 10 to 100 times background. Specific binding of a compound under such conditions requires a compound that is selected for its specificity for a particular receptor. For example, small organic molecules can be screened to obtain only those compounds that specifically or selectively bind to a selected receptor and not with other receptors or proteins. A variety of assay formats may be used to select compounds that are selective for a particular receptor. For example, High-throughput screening assays are routinely used to select compounds that are selective for a particular a receptor.\n\n\n[0201] As used herein, the term \"Sickle cell anemia\" refers to an inherited disorder of the red blood cells in which both hemoglobin alleles encode the sickle hemoglobin (S) protein, i.e., the S/S genotype. The presence of abnormal hemoglobin results in the production of unusually shaped cells, which do not survive the usual length of time in the blood circulation. Thus, anemia results. \"Anemia\" refers to a decrease in the number of red blood cells and/or hemoglobin in the blood.\n\n\n[0202] The term \"Sickle cell disease\" refers to an inherited disorder of the red blood cells in which one hemoglobin allele encodes the sickle hemoglobin (S) protein, and the other allele encodes another unusual hemoglobin protein, such as hemoglobin (S), (C), (D), (E), and\n\n\n(βThal). Examples of sickle cell disease genotypes include, without limitation, the S/S, S/C, S/D, S/E, and S/βThal genotypes. The most common types of sickle cell disease include sickle cell anemia, sickle-hemoglobin C disease, sickle beta-plus thalassemia, and sickle beta- zero thalassemia.

Methods of Synthesis \n\n [0272] The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by known organic synthesis techniques, including the methods described in more detail in the Examples. In general, the compounds of structure (I) above may be made by the following Figure 3, wherein all substituents are as defined above unless indicated otherwise. [0273] Compounds having formula I may be prepared according to Figure 3. Carboxylic acid 1.1 is converted to acid chloride 1.2 via a one-step procedure by treatment with a chlorination agent, such as thionyl chloride, and esterification with an alcohol, such as ethanol, to form compound 1.3 using conditions similar to that described below. Ester 1.3 is dichlorinated with a chlorinating agent, such as phosphorous oxychloride. Selective displacement of the 4-chloro group of the 2,4-dichloropyrimidine by an appropriate amine, such as R\n1\n-D\n1\n-NH\n2\n (available commercially or synthesized using methods known to those skilled in the art), under basic conditions, such as with diisopropylamine (DIA), provides compounds of formula 1.5. Subsequent hydrolysis of the ester, displacement of the second chloro group with EDC and treatment with ammonia gives compound 1.7. Benzotriazolyl ether compound 1.7 may also be prepared through a linear route. Displacement of the benzotriazolyl ether group with an appropriate amine, such as R\n2\n-Y'-NH\n2\n (available commercially or synthesized using methods known to those skilled in the art), gives the desired product I, wherein R\n1\n and R\n2\n are as previously defined.\n\n\n[0274] One skilled in the art will recognize that in certain embodiments of structure (I) when R '-D\n1\n or R\n\"\n- Y\n1\n comprises a terminal heteroatom, it may be advantageous to use a protecting group strategy. The protecting group can be removed using methods known to those skilled in the art to yield compounds of structure (1).\n\n\n[0275] The compounds of the present invention may generally be utilized as the free base. Alternatively, the compounds of this invention may be used in the form of acid addition salts as described below.\n\n\nc. Inhibition of syk and JAK Kinases\n\n\n[0276] The activity of a specified compound as an inhibitor of a JAK kinase may be assessed in vitro or in vivo. In some embodiments, the activity of a specified compound can be tested in a cellular assay. Selectivity could also be ascertained in biochemical assays with isolated kinases. \n\n [0277] Similar types of assays can be used to assess JAK kinase inhibitory activity and to determine the degree of selectivity of the particular compound as compared to syk kinase. One means of assaying for such inhibition is detection of the effect of the compounds of the present invention on the upregulation of downstream gene products. In the Ramos/IL4 assay, B-cells are stimulated with the cytokine Interleukin-4 (IL-4) leading to the activation of the JAK/Stat pathway through phosphorylation of the JAK family kinases, JAKl and JAK3, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor Stat-6. One of the genes upregulated by activated Stat-6 is the low affinity IgE receptor, CD23. To study the effect of inhibitors (e.g., the 2,4-substituted pyrimindinediamine compounds described herein) on the JAKl and JAK3 kinases, human Ramos B-cells are stimulated with human IL-4. 10' post- stimulation, cells are subjected to intracellular flow cytometry to measure the extent of STAT-6 phosphorylation. 20 to 24 hours post-stimulation, cells are stained for upregulation of CD23 and analyzed using flow cytometry. A reduction of the amount of phospohorylated STAT-6 and/or cell surface CD23 present compared to control conditions indicates that the test compound actively inhibits the JAK kinase pathway.\n\n\n[0278] Additionally, IL-6 stimulation of Ramos B-cells induces JAKs 1, 2, and Tyk2, leading to Stat-3 and Erk phosphorylation. 10' post-stimulation, cells are subjected to intracellular flow cytometry to measure the ability of compound to inhibit these phosphorylation events. To specifically measure the activity of JAK2, the CellSensor irfl-bla HEL cell line expressing the beta-lactamase reporter gene controlled by Stat5 will be used (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). These cells express a constituitively active JAK2 mutant (JAK2V617F), found naturally in myeloproliferative neoplasms (Constantinescu, S., et.al, Trends Biochem ScL, 2008; 33: 122-31). A reduction in the amount of beta-lactamase reporter gene expression is used a measure of the JAK2 inhibitory activity of compounds. [0279] The activity of the compounds of the invention may additionally be characterized by assaying the effect of the compounds of the present invention described herein on A549 lung epithelial cells and U937 cells. A549 lung epithelial cells and U937 cells up-regulate ICAM-I (CD54) surface expression in response to a variety of different stimuli. Therefore, using ICAM-I expression as readout, test compound effects on different signaling pathways can be assessed in the same cell type. Stimulation with EL- lβ through the IL-I β receptor activates the TRAF6/NFκB pathway resulting in up-regulation of ICAM-I. IFN. gamma, induces ICAM-I up-regulation through activation of the JAK1/JAK2 pathway. The up-regulation of \n\n ICAM-I can be quantified by flow cytometry across a compound dose curve and EC\n50\n values are calculated.\n\n\n[0280] The activity of the compounds of the invention may additionally be characterized by assaying the effect of the compounds of the present invention described herein on A549 lung epithelial cells and U937 cells.

Exemplary assays of this type are described in greater detail in the Examples.\n\n\n[0281] Active compounds as described herein generally inhibit the JAK kinase pathway with an IC\n5O\n in the range of about 1 mM or less, as measured in the assays described herein. Of course, skilled artisans will appreciate that compounds which exhibit lower IC\n50\nS, (on the order, for example, of 100 μM, 75 μM, 50 μM, 40 μM, 30 μM, 20 μM, 15 μM, 10 μM, 5 μM, 1 μM, 500 nM, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, or even lower) can be particularly useful in therapeutic applications. In instances where activity specific to a particular cell type is desired, the compound can be assayed for activity with the desired cell type and counter- screened for a lack of activity against other cell types. The desired degree of \"inactivity\" in such counter screens, or the desired ratio of activity vs. inactivity, may vary for different situations and can be selected by the user.\n\n\n[0282] The active compounds also typically inhibit EL-4 stimulated expression of CD23 in B-cells with an IC\n50\n in the range of about 20 μM or less, typically in the range of about 10 μM, 1 μM, 500 nM, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, or even lower. A suitable assay that can be used is the assay described in the Examples, \"Assay for Ramos B-cell Line Stimulated with IL-4.\" In certain embodiments, the active compounds of the present invention have an IC\n50\n of less than or equal to 5 μM, greater than 5 μM but less than 20 μM, greater than 20 μM, or greater than 20 μM but less than 50 μM in the assay described in the Examples. [0283] The active compounds also typically inhibit expression of ICAMl (CD54) induced by IFN.gamma. exposure in U937 or A549 cells with an IC\n50\n in the range of about 20 μM or \n\n less, typically in the range of about 10 μM, 1 μM, 500 nM, 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, or even lower. The IC\n50\n against expression of ICAM (CD54) in IFN. gamma, stimulated cells can be determined in a functional cellular assay with an isolated A549 or U937 cell line. Suitable assays that can be used are the assays described in the Examples, \"A549 Epithelial Line Stimulated with IFNγ\" and \"U937 IFN.gamma. ICAMl FACS Assay,\" respectively. In certain embodiments, the active compounds of the present invention have an IC\n50\n of less than or equal to 20 μM, greater than 20 μM, or greater than 20μM but less than 50 μM in the assays described in the Examples.\n\n\nd.

A host of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the pharmaceutical field. If pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention are utilized in these compositions, those salts are preferably derived from inorganic or organic acids and bases.

Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are thereby obtained.\n\n\n[0287] The compounds utilized in the compositions and methods of this invention may also be modified by appending appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system, etc.), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion.\n\n\n[0288] The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be manufactured by methods well known in the art such as conventional granulating, mixing, dissolving, encapsulating, lyophilizing, or emulsifying processes, among others. Compositions may be produced in various forms, including granules, precipitates, or particulates, powders, including freeze dried, rotary dried or spray dried powders, amorphous powders, tablets, capsules, syrup, suppositories, injections, emulsions, elixirs, suspensions or solutions. Formulations may optionally contain stabilizers, pH modifiers, surfactants, bioavailability modifiers and combinations of these. \n\n [0289] The term \"unit dosage form\" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of drug calculated to produce the desired onset, tolerability, and/or therapeutic effects, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient (e.g., an ampoule). In addition, more concentrated compositions may be prepared, from which the more dilute unit dosage compositions may then be produced. The more concentrated compositions thus will contain substantially more than, e.g., at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more times the amount of one or more syk and/or JAK inhibitors.\n\n\n[0290] Methods for preparing such dosage forms are known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, REMINGTON'S P HARM A CEUTICAL SCIENCES, 18TH ED. , Mack Publishing Co. , Easton, PA (1990)).

March, Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure, 4\nth\n Ed. (New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1992).\n\n\n[0291] The compositions typically include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and may additionally include other medicinal agents, carriers, adjuvants, diluents, tissue permeation enhancers, solubilizers, and the like.

[0294] Administration of a composition comprising one or more syk and/or JAK inhibitors with one or more suitable pharmaceutical excipients as advantageous can be carried out via any of the accepted modes of administration. Thus, administration can be, for example, oral, topical, intravenous, subcutaneous, transcutaneous, transdermal, intramuscular, intra-joint, parenteral, intra-arteriole, intradermal, intraventricular, intracranial, intraperitoneal, intralesional, intranasal, rectal, vaginal, by inhalation or via an implanted reservoir. The term \"parenteral\" as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques. Preferably, the compositions are administered orally or intravenously. The formulations of the invention may be designed as short-acting, fast-releasing, or long- acting. Still further, compounds can be administered in a local rather than systemic means, such as administration (e.g., injection) as a sustained release formulation. According to a representative embodiment, the compositions of this invention are formulated for pharmaceutical administration to a mammal, preferably a human being.\n\n\n[0295] The compositions of the present invention containing one or more syk and/or JAK inhibitors can be administered repeatedly, e.g., at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more times, or the composition may be administered by continuous infusion. Suitable sites of administration include, but are not limited to, skin, bronchial, gastrointestinal, anal, vaginal, eye, and ear. The formulations may take the form of solid, semi-solid, lyophilized powder, or liquid dosage forms, such as, for example, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, suppositories, retention enemas, creams, ointments, lotions, gels, aerosols, or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable for simple administration of precise dosages. \n\n [0296] The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be in any orally acceptable dosage form, including tablets, capsules, cachets, emulsions, suspensions, solutions, syrups, elixirs, sprays, boluses, lozenges, powders, granules, and sustained-release formulations.

Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered syk and/or JAK inhibitors with any suitable carrier.\n\n\n[0298] Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These may be prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax, polyethylene glycol (PEG), hard fat, and/or hydrogenated cocoglyceride. Compositions suitable for rectal administration may also comprise a rectal enema unit containing one or more syk and/or JAK inhibitors and pharmaceutically- acceptable vehicles (e.g., 50% aqueous ethanol or an aqueous salt solution) that are physiologically compatible with the rectum and/or colon. The rectal enema unit contains an applicator tip protected by an inert cover, preferably comprised of polyethylene, lubricated with a lubricant such as white petrolatum, and preferably protected by a one-way valve to \n\n prevent back-flow of the dispensed formula. The rectal enema unit is also of sufficient length, preferably two inches, to be inserted into the colon via the anus.\n\n\n[0299] Liquid compositions can be prepared by dissolving or dispersing one or more syk and/or JAK inhibitors and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants in a carrier such as, for example, aqueous saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to form a solution or suspension, e.g., for oral, topical, or intravenous administration. Pharmaceutical formulations may be prepared as liquid suspensions or solutions using a sterile liquid, such as oil, water, alcohol, and combinations thereof. Pharmaceutically suitable surfactants, suspending agents or emulsifying agents, may be added for oral or parenteral administration. Suspensions may include oils, such as peanut oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil and olive oil. Suspension preparation may also contain esters of fatty acids, such as ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, fatty acid glycerides and acetylated fatty acid glycerides. Suspension formulations may include alcohols, such as ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, hexadecyl alcohol, glycerol and propylene glycol. Ethers, such as poly(ethyleneglycol), petroleum hydrocarbons, such as mineral oil and petrolatum, and water may also be used in suspension formulations.\n\n\n[0300] The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be in a topical form, especially when the target of treatment includes areas or organs readily accessible by topical application, including diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs. For topical administration, the composition containing one or more syk and/or JAK inhibitors can be in the form of emulsions, lotions, gels, foams, creams, jellies, solutions, suspensions, ointments, and transdermal patches.\n\n\n[0301] Topical application for the lower intestinal tract may be effected in a rectal suppository formulation (see above) or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically- transdermal patches may also be used. For topical applications, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one or more carriers. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a suitable lotion or cream containing the active components suspended or \n\n dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable carriers include mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters, wax, cetyl alcohol, 2- octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.\n\n\n[0302] The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. For delivery by inhalation, the compositions can be delivered as a dry powder or in liquid form via a nebulizer. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons and/or other conventional solubilizing or dispersing agents.\n\n\n[0303] For ophthalmic use, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated as micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, either with our without a preservative, such as benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic uses, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in an ointment, such as petrolatum.\n\n\n[0304] For parenteral administration, the compositions can be in the form of sterile injectable solutions and sterile packaged powders. Preferably, injectable solutions are formulated at a pH of about 4.5 to about 7.5.\n\n\n[0305] Sterile injectable forms of the compositions of this invention may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension. These suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents which are commonly used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms \n\n including emulsions and suspensions. Other commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation. Compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection such as by bolus injection or continuous infusion. A unit dosage form for injection may be in ampoules or in multi- dose containers.\n\n\n[0306] The compositions of the present invention can also be provided in a lyophilized form. Such compositions may include a buffer, e.g., bicarbonate, for reconstitution prior to administration, or the buffer may be included in the lyophilized composition for reconstitution with, e.g., water. The lyophilized composition may further comprise a suitable vasoconstrictor, e.g., epinephrine. The lyophilized composition can be provided in a syringe, optionally packaged in combination with the buffer for reconstitution, such that the reconstituted composition can be immediately administered to a patient.\n\n\n[0307] Any of the above dosage forms containing effective amounts are within the bounds of routine experimentation and within the scope of the invention. A therapeutically effective dose may vary depending upon the route of administration and dosage form. The representative compound or compounds of the invention is a formulation that exhibits a high therapeutic index. The therapeutic index is the dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects which can be expressed as the ratio between LD\n5O\n and ED\n50\n. The LD\n50\n is the dose lethal to 50% of the population and the ED\n50\n is the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population. The LD\n50\n and ED\n50\n are determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in animal cell cultures or experimental animals.\n\n\n[0308] Besides those representative dosage forms described above, pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and carriers and dosage forms are generally known to those skilled in the art and are included in the invention. It should be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient, and the time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, judgment of the treating physician and severity of the particular disease being treated. The amount of active ingredient(s) will also depend upon the particular compound and other therapeutic agent, if present, in the composition. \n\n e. Methods of Use [0309] The invention provides methods of inhibiting or decreasing syk and/or JAK activity as well as treating or ameliorating a syk and/or JAK associated state, symptom, condition, disorder or disease in a patient in need thereof (e.g., human or non-human). In one embodiment, the syk and/or JAK associated state, symptom, condition, disorder or disease is mediated, at least in part by syk and/or JAK kinase activity. In more specific embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating a condition or disorder mediated at least in part by syk and/or JAK kinase activity is cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disease or autoimmune disease. [0310] In one embodiment, the invention provides methods for preventing or treating a condition in a mammal characterized by undesired thrombosis comprising the step of administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention. Such conditions include, but are not limited, to restenosis, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, refractory angina, occlusive coronary thrombosis occurring post-thrombolytic therapy or post-coronary angioplasty, a thrombotically mediated cerebrovascular syndrome, embolic stroke, thrombotic stroke, transient ischemic attacks, venous thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, coagulopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, thromboangiitis obliterans, thrombotic disease associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic complications associated with extracorporeal circulation, thrombotic complications associated with instrumentation such as cardiac or other intravascular catheterization, intra-aortic balloon pump, coronary stent or cardiac valve, conditions requiring the fitting of prosthetic devices, and the like.\n\n\n[0311] In a further embodiment, the present invention provides a method for treating thrombosis, immune thrombocyte purura, heparin induced thrombocytopenia, dilated cardiomypathy, sickle cell disease, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, vacular inflammation, unstable angina or acute coronary syndromes.\n\n\n[0312] In another embodiment, the present invention also provides a method for treating allergy, asthma, theumatoid arthritis, B Cell mediated disease such as Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, anti phospholipids syndrome, lupus, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, end stage renal disease or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. \n\n [0313] In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method for treating hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\n\n[0314] The compounds described herein are also potent and/or selective inhibitors of JAK kinases. As a consequence of this activity, the compounds can be used in a variety of in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo contexts to regulate or inhibit JAK kinase activity, signaling cascades in which JAK kinases play a role, and the biological responses effected by such signaling cascades. For example, in one embodiment, the compounds can be used to inhibit JAK kinase, either in vitro or in vivo, in virtually any cell type expressing the JAK kinase, such as in hematopoietic cells in which, for example, JAK3 is predominantly expressed. They may also be used to regulate signal transduction cascades in which JAK kinases, particularly JAK3, play a role. Such JAK-dependent signal transduction cascades include, but are not limited to, the signaling cascades of cytokine receptors that involve the common gamma chain, such as, for example, the IL-4, JL-I, IL-5, IL-9, IL- 15 and IL-21, or IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 receptor signaling cascades. The compounds may also be used in vitro or in vivo to regulate, and in particular to inhibit, cellular or biological responses affected by such JAK-dependent signal transduction cascades. Such cellular or biological responses include, but are not limited to, IL-4/ramos CD23 upregulation and IL-2 mediated T-cell proliferation. Importantly, the compounds can be used to inhibit JAK kinases in vivo as a therapeutic approach towards the treatment or prevention of diseases mediated, either wholly or in part, by a JAK kinase activity (referred to herein as \"JAK kinase mediated diseases\").\n\n\nNon-limiting examples of JAK kinase mediated diseases that can be treated or prevented with the compounds include, but are not limited to, the following: allergies; asthma; autoimmune diseases such as transplant rejection (e.g., kidney, heart, lung, liver, pancreas, skin, small intestine, large intestine, host versus graft reaction (HVGR), and graft versus host reaction (GVHR)), rheumatoid arthritis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, psoraiasis, and Sjogren's syndrome; Type II inflammatory diseases such as vascular inflammation (including vasculitis, arteritis, atherosclerosis, and coronary artery disease); diseases of the central nervous system such as stroke; pulmonary diseases such as bronchitis obliteraus and primary pulmonary hypertension; solid, delayed Type IV hypersensitivity reactions; and hematologic malignancies such as leukemia and lymphomas.\n\n\n[0315] Examples of diseases that are mediated, at least in part, by JAK kinases that can be treated or prevented according to the methods include, but are not limited to, allergies, \n\n asthma, autoimmune diseases such as transplant rejection (e.g., kidney, heart, lung, liver, pancreas, skin, host versus graft reaction (HVGR), etc.), rheumatoid arthritis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, psoraiasis and Sjogren's syndrome, Type II inflammatory disease such as vascular inflammation (including vasculitis, ateritis, atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease) or other inflammatory diseases such as osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, spastic colon, low grade scarring (e.g., scleroderma, increased fibrosis, keloids, post-surgical scars, pulmonary fibrosis, vascular spasms, migraine, reperfusion injury and post myocardial infarction), and sicca complex or syndrome, diseases of the central nervous system such as stroke, pulmonary diseases such as bronchitis obliterous and primary and primary pulmonary hypertension, delayed or cell-mediated, Type IV hypersensitivity and solid and hematologic malignancies such as leukemias and lyphomas.\n\n\n[0316] In another embodiment, this invention provides a method of inhibiting an activity of a JAK kinase, comprising contacting the JAK kinase with an amount of a compound effective to inhibit an activity of the JAK kinase, wherein the compound is selected from the compounds of this invention. In certain embodiments of the methods described herein, the method is carried out in vivo.\n\n\n[0317] In another embodiment, this invention provides a method of inhibiting an activity of a JAK kinase, comprising contacting in vitro a JAK3 kinase with an amount of a compound effective to inhibit an activity of the JAK kinase, wherein the compound is selected from the compounds of this invention.\n\n\n[0318] In a specific embodiment, the compounds can be used to treat and/or prevent rejection in organ and/or tissue transplant recipients (i.e., treat and/or prevent allorgraft rejection). Allografts can be rejected through either a cell-mediated or humoral immune reaction of the recipient against transplant (histocompability) antigens present on the membranes of the donor's cells. The strongest antigens are governed by a complex of genetic loci termed human leukocyte group A (HLA) antigens. Together with the ABO blood groups antigens, they are the chief transplantation antigens detectable in humans. [0319] Rejection following transplantation can generally be broken into three categories: hyperacute, occurring hours to days following transplantation; acute, occurring days to \n\n months following transplantation; and chronic, occurring months to years following transplantation.\n\n\n[0320] Hyperacute rejection is caused mainly by the production of host antibodies that attack the graft tissue. In a hyperacute rejection reaction, antibodies are observed in the transplant vascular very soon after transplantation. Shortly thereafter, vascular clotting occurs, leading to ischemia, eventual necrosis and death. The graft infarction is unresponsive to known immunosuppressive therapies. Because HLA antigens can be identified in vitro, pre-transplant screening is used to significantly reduce hyperacute rejection. As a consequence of this screening, hyperacute rejection is relatively uncommon today. [0321] Acute rejection is thought to be mediated by the accumulation of antigen specific cells in the graft tissue. The T-cell-mediated immune reaction against these antigens (i.e., HVGR or GVHR) is the principle mechanism of acute rejection. Accumulation of these cells leads to damage of the graft tissue. It is believed that both CD4+ helper T-cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells are involved in the process and that the antigen is presented by donor and host dendritic cells. The CD4+ helper T-cells help recruit other effector cells, such as macrophapges and eosinophils, to the graft. Accessing T-cell activation signal transduction cascades (for example, CD28, CD40L, and CD2 cascades) are also involved.\n\n\n[0322] The cell-mediated acute rejection can be reversed in many cases by intensifying immunotherapy. After successful reversal, severely damaged elements of the graft heal by fibrosis and the remainder of the graft appears normal. After resolution of acute rejection, dosages of immunosuppressive drugs can be reduced to very low levels.\n\n\n[0323] Chronic rejection, which is a particular problem in renal transplants, often progresses insidiously despite increased immunosuppressive therapy. It is thought to be due, in large part, to cell-mediated Type FV hypersensitivity. The pathologic profile differs from that of acute rejection. The arterial endothelium is primarily involved with extensive proliferation that may gradually occlude the vessel lumen, leading to ischemia, fibrosis, a thickened intima, and atherosclerotic changes. Chronic rejection is mainly due to a progressive obliteration of graft vasculature and resembles a slow, vasculitic process.\n\n\n[0324] In Type IV hypersensitivity, CD8 cytotoxic T-cells and CD4 helper T cells recognize either intracellular or extracellular synthesized antigen when it is complexed, respectively, with either Class I or Class II MHC molecules. Macrophages function as antigen-presenting cells and release IL-I, which promotes proliferation of helper T-cells. \n\n Helper T-cells release interferon gamma and IL-2, which together regulate delayed hyperactivity reactions mediated by macrophage activation and immunity mediated by T cells. In the case of organ transplant, the cytotoxic T-cells destroy the graft cells on contact.\n\n\n[0325] Since JAK kinases play a critical role in the activation of T-cells, the compounds described herein can be used to treat and/or prevent many aspects of transplant rejection, and are particularly useful in the treatment and/or prevention of rejection reactions that are mediated, at least in part, by T-cells, such as HVGR or GVHR. The compounds can also be used to treat and/or prevent chronic rejection in transplant recipients and, in particular, in renal transplant recipients. The compound can also be administered to a tissue or an organ prior to transplanting the tissue or organ in the transplant recipient.\n\n\n[0326] In another embodiment, this invention provides a method of treating a T-cell mediated autoimmune disease, comprising administering to a patient suffering from such an autoimmune disease an amount of a compound effective to treat the autoimmune disease wherein the compound is selected from the compounds of the invention. In certain embodiments of the methods the autoimmune disease is multiple sclerosis (MS), psoraisis, or Sjogran's syndrome. Such autoimmune disease include, but are not limited to, those autoimmune diseases that are frequently designated as single organ or single cell-type autoimmune disorders and those autoimmune disease that are frequently designated as involving systemic autoimmune disorder. Non-limiting examples of diseases frequently designated as single organ or single cell-type autoimmune disorders include: Hashimoto's thyroiditis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune atrophic gastritis of pernicious anemia, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, autoimmune orchitis, Goodpasture's disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, sympathetic ophthalmia, myasthenia gravis, Graves' disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic aggressive hepatitis, ulcerative colitis and membranous glomerulopathy. Non-limiting examples of diseases often designated as involving systemic autoimmune disorder include: systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, Reiter's syndrome, polymyositis-dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, polyarteritis nodosa, multiple sclerosis and bullous pemphigoid. Additional autoimmune diseases, which can be .beta.-cell (humoral) based or T-cell based, include Cogan's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, autoimmune alopecia, Type I or juvenile onset diabetes, and thyroiditis. \n\n [0327] The types of autoimmune diseases that may be treated or prevented with such prodrugs generally include those disorders involving tissue injury that occurs as a result of a humoral and/or cell-mediated response to immunogens or antigens of endogenous and/or exogenous origin. Such diseases are frequently referred to as diseases involving the nonanaphylactic (i.e., Type II, Type III and/or Type FV) hypersensitivity reactions.\n\n\n[0328] Type I hypersensitivity reactions generally result from the release of pharmacologically active substances, such as histamine, from mast and/or basophil cells following contact with a specific exogenous antigen. As mentioned above, such Type I reactions play a role in numerous diseases, including allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, etc. [0329] Type II hypersensitivity reactions (also referred to as cytotoxic, cytolytic complement-dependent or cell-stimulating hypersensitivity reactions) result when immunoglobulins react with antigenic components of cells or tissue, or with an antigen or hapten that has become intimately coupled to cells or tissue. Diseases that are commonly associated with Type II hypersensitivity reactions include, but are not limited, to autoimmune hemolytic anemia, erythroblastosis fetalis and Goodpasture's disease.\n\n\n[0330] Type III hypersensitivity reactions, (also referred to as toxic complex, soluble complex, or immune complex hypersensitivity reactions) result from the deposition of soluble circulating antigen-immunoglobulin complexes in vessels or in tissues, with accompanying acute inflammatory reactions at the site of immune complex deposition. Non-limiting examples of prototypical Type III reaction diseases include the Arthus reaction, rheumatoid arthritis, serum sickness, systemic lupus erythematosis, certain types of glomerulonephritis, multiple sclerosis and bullous pemphingoid.\n\n\n[0331] Type IV hypersensitivity reactions (frequently called cellular, cell-mediated, delayed, or tuberculin-type hypersensitivity reactions) are caused by sensitized T- lymphocytes which result from contact with a specific antigen. Non-limiting examples of diseases cited as involving Type IV reactions are contact dermatitis and allograft rejection.\n\n\n[0332] Autoimmune diseases associated with any of the above nonanaphylactic hypersensitivity reactions may be treated or prevented with the prodrugs according to structural formulae (I) and (Ia). In particular, the methods may be used to treat or prevent those autoimmune diseases frequently characterized as single organ or single cell-type autoimmune disorders including, but not limited to: Hashimoto's thyroiditis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune atrophic gastritis of pernicious anemia, autoimmune \n\n encephalomyelitis, autoimmune orchitis, Goodpasture's disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, sympathetic ophthalmia, myasthenia gravis, Graves' disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic aggressive hepatitis, ulcerative colitis and membranous glomerulopathy, as well as those autoimmune diseases frequently characterized as involving systemic autoimmune disorder, which include but are not limited to: systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, Reiter's syndrome, polymyositis-dermatomyositis, systemic sclerosis, polyarteritis nodosa, multiple sclerosis and bullous pemphigoid.\n\n\n[0333] It will be appreciated by skilled artisans that many of the above-listed autoimmune diseases are associated with severe symptoms, the amelioration of which provides significant therapeutic benefit even in instances where the underlying autoimmune disease may not be ameliorated.\n\n\n[0334] Therapy using the compounds described herein can be applied alone, or it can be applied in combination with or adjunctive to other common immunosuppressive therapies, such as, for example, the following: mercaptopurine; corticosteroids such as prednisone; methylprednisolone and prednisolone; alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide; calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus; inhibitors of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) such as mycophenolate, mycophenolate mofetil, and azathioprine; and agents designed to suppress cellular immunity while leaving the recipient's humoral immunologic response intact, including various antibodies (for example, antilymphocyte globulin (ALG), antithymocyte globulin (ATG), monoclonal anti-T-cell antibodies (0KT3)) and irradiation. These various agents can be used in accordance with their standard or common dosages, as specified in the prescribing information accompanying commercially available forms of the drugs (see also: the prescribing information in the 2006 Edition of The Physician's Desk Reference), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. Azathioprine is currently available from Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., under the brand name AZASAN; mercaptopurine is currently available from Gate Pharmaceuticals, Inc., under the brand name PURINETHOL; prednisone and prednisolone are currently available from Roxane Laboratories, Inc.; Methyl prednisolone is currently available from Pfizer; sirolimus (rapamycin) is currently available from Wyeth-Ayerst under the brand name RAPAMUNE; tacrolimus is currently available from Fujisawa under the brand name PROGRAF; cyclosporine is current available from Novartis under the brand dame SANDIMMUNE and from Abbott under the brand name GENGRAF; IMPDH inhibitors \n\n such as mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolic acid are currently available from Roche under the brand name CELLCEPT and from Novartis under the brand name MYFORTIC; azathioprine is currently available from Glaxo Smith Kline under the brand name IMURAN; and antibodies are currently available from Ortho Biotech under the brand name ORTHOCLONE, from Novartis under the brand name SEVIULECT (basiliximab), and from Roche under the brand name ZENAPAX (daclizumab).\n\n\n[0335] In another embodiment, the compounds could be administered either in combination or adjunctively with an inhibitor of a syk kinase, syk kinase is a tyrosine kinase known to play a critical role in Fey receptor signaling, as well as in other signaling cascades, such as those involving B-cell receptor signaling (Turner et al., (2000), Immunology Today 21: 148- 154) and integrins beta(l), beta (2), and beta (3) in neutrophils (Mocsai et al., (2002), Immunity 16:547-558). For example, syk kinase plays a pivotal role in high affinity IgE receptor signaling in mast cells that leads to activation and subsequent release of multiple chemical mediators that trigger allergic attacks. However, unlike the JAK kinases, which help regulate the pathways involved in delayed or cell-mediated Type FV hypersensitivity reactions, syk kinase helps regulate the pathways involved in immediate IgE-mediated, Type I hypersensitivity reactions. Certain compounds that affect the syk pathway may or may not also affect the JAK pathways.\n\n\n[0336] Suitable syk inhibitory compounds are described, for example, in Ser. No. 10/355,543 filed Jan. 31 , 2003 (publication no. 2004/0029902); WO 03/063794; Ser. No.\n\n\n10/631,029 filed JuI. 29, 2003; WO 2004/014382; Ser.

The activity of a specified compound as an inhibitor of a syk and/or JAK kinase can be assessed in vitro or in vivo. In some embodiments, the activity of a specified compound can be tested in a cellular assay. [0356] \"Cell proliferative disorder\" refers to a disorder characterized by abnormal proliferation of cells. A proliferative disorder does not imply any limitation with respect to the rate of cell growth, but merely indicates loss of normal controls that affect growth and cell division. Thus, in some embodiments, cells of a proliferative disorder can have the same cell division rates as normal cells but do not respond to signals that limit such growth. Within the ambit of \"cell proliferative disorder\" is neoplasm or tumor, which is an abnormal growth of tissue. Cancer refers to any of various malignant neoplasms characterized by the proliferation of cells that have the capability to invade surrounding tissue and/or metastasize to new colonization sites.\n\n\n[0357] Generally, cell proliferative disorders treatable with the compounds disclosed herein relate to any disorder characterized by aberrant cell proliferation. These include various tumors and cancers, benign or malignant, metastatic or non-metastatic. Specific properties of cancers, such as tissue invasiveness or metastasis, can be targeted using the methods described herein. Cell proliferative disorders include a variety of cancers, including, among others, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung squamous carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma.\n\n\n[0358] In some embodiments, the cell proliferative disorder treated is a hematopoietic neoplasm, which is aberrant growth of cells of the hematopoietic system. Hematopoietic malignancies can have its origins in pluripotent stem cells, multipotent progenitor cells, oligopotent committed progenitor cells, precursor cells, and terminally differentiated cells involved in hematopoiesis. Some hematological malignancies are believed to arise from hematopoietic stem cells, which have the ability for self renewal. For instance, cells capable of developing specific subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (Cynthia K. Hahn, \n\n Kenneth N. Ross, Rose M. Kakoza, Steven Karr, Jinyan Du, Shao-E Ong, Todd R. Golub, Kimberly Stegmaier, Syk is a new target for AML differentiation, Blood, 2007, 110, Abstract 209) upon transplantation display the cell surface markers of hematopoietic stem cells, implicating hematopoietic stem cells as the source of leukemic cells. Blast cells that do not have a cell marker characteristic of hematopoietic stem cells appear to be incapable of establishing tumors upon transplantation (Blaire et al., 1997, Blood 89:3104-3112). The stem cell origin of certain hematological malignancies also finds support in the observation that specific chromosomal abnormalities associated with particular types of leukemia can be found in normal cells of hematopoietic lineage as well as leukemic blast cells. For instance, the reciprocal translocation t(9q34;22ql 1) associated with approximately 95% of chronic myelogenous leukemia appears to be present in cells of the myeloid, erythroid, and lymphoid lineage, suggesting that the chromosomal aberration originates in hematopoietic stem cells. A subgroup of cells in certain types of CML displays the cell marker phenotype of hematopoietic stem cells. [0359] Although hematopoietic neoplasms often originate from stem cells, committed progenitor cells or more terminally differentiated cells of a developmental lineage can also be the source of some leukemias. For example, forced expression of the fusion protein Bcr/Abl (associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia) in common myeloid progenitor or granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells produces a leukemic-like condition. Moreover, some chromosomal aberrations associated with subtypes of leukemia are not found in the cell population with a marker phenotype of hematopoietic stem cells, but are found in a cell population displaying markers of a more differentiated state of the hematopoietic pathway (Turhan et al., 1995, Blood 85:2154-2161). Thus, while committed progenitor cells and other differentiated cells may have only a limited potential for cell division, leukemic cells may have acquired the ability to grow unregulated, in some instances mimicking the self-renewal characteristics of hematopoietic stem cells (Passegue et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2003, 100: 11842-9).\n\n\n[0360] In some embodiments, the hematopoietic neoplasm treated is a lymphoid neoplasm, where the abnormal cells are derived from and/or display the characteristic phenotype of cells of the lymphoid lineage. Lymphoid neoplasms can be subdivided into B-cell neoplasms, T and NK-cell neoplasms, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. B-cell neoplasms can be further subdivided into precursor B-cell neoplasm and mature/peripheral B-cell neoplasm. Exemplary B-cell neoplasms are precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (precursor \n\n B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) while exemplary mature/peripheral B-cell neoplasms are B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, plasma cell myeloma/plasmacytoma, extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of MALT type, nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and Burkitt's lymphoma/Burkitt cell leukemia. T- cell and Nk-cell neoplasms are further subdivided into precursor T-cell neoplasm and mature (peripheral) T-cell neoplasms. Exemplary precursor T-cell neoplasm is precursor T- lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia) while exemplary mature (peripheral) T-cell neoplasms are T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia T-cell granular lymphocytic leukemia, aggressive NK-cell leukemia, adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (HTLV-I), extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, enteropathy- type T-cell lymphoma, hepatosplenic gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, Mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome, Anaplastic large- cell lymphoma, T/null cell, primary cutaneous type, Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise characterized, Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, T/null cell, primary systemic type. The third member of lymphoid neoplasms is Hodgkin's lymphoma, also referred to as Hodgkin's disease. Exemplary diagnosis of this class that can be treated with the compounds include, among others, nodular lymphocyte- predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma, and various classical forms of Hodgkin's disease, exemplary members of which are Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's lymphoma (grades 1 and 2), Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, Mixed cellularity Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Lymphocyte depletion Hodgkin's lymphoma. In various embodiments, any of the lymphoid neoplasms that are associated with aberrant JAK activity can be treated with the syk and/or JAK inhibitory compounds.\n\n\n[0361] In some embodiments, the hematopoietic neoplasm treated is a myeloid neoplasm. This group comprises a large class of cell proliferative disorders involving or displaying the characteristic phenotype of the cells of the myeloid lineage. Myeloid neoplasms can be subdivided into myeloproliferative diseases, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases, myelodysplastic syndromes, and acute myeloid leukemias. Exemplary myeloproliferative diseases are chronic myelogenous leukemia (e.g., Philadelphia chromosome positive (t(9;22)(qq34;ql I)), chronic neutrophilic leukemia, chronic eosinophilic \n\n leukemia/hypereosinophilic syndrome, chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocythemia. Exemplary myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases are chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Exemplary myelodysplastic syndromes are refractory anemia, with ringed sideroblasts and without ringed sideroblasts, refractory cytopenia\n\n\n(myelodysplastic syndrome) with multilineage dysplasia, refractory anemia (myelodysplastic syndrome) with excess blasts, 5q-syndrome, and myelodysplastic syndrome. In various embodiments, any of the myeloid neoplasms that are associated with aberrant syk and/or JAK activity can be treated with the syk and/or JAK inhibitory compounds. [0362] In some embodiments, the compounds can be used to treat Acute myeloid leukemias (AML), which represent a large class of myeloid neoplasms having its own subdivision of disorders. These subdivisions include, among others, AMLs with recurrent cytogenetic translocations, AML with multilineage dysplasia, and other AML not otherwise categorized. Exemplary AMLs with recurrent cytogenetic translocations include, among others, AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22), AMLl(CBF-alpha)/ETO, Acute promyelocytic leukemia (AML with t(15;17)(q22;ql 1-12) and variants, PMIVR AR-alpha), AML with abnormal bone marrow eosinophils (inv(16)(pl3q22) or t(16;16)(pl3;ql 1), CBFb/MYHl IX), and AML with I lq23 (MLL) abnormalities. Exemplary AML with multilineage dysplasia are those that are associated with or without prior myelodysplastic syndrome. Other acute myeloid leukemias not classified within any definable group include, AML minimally differentiated, AML without maturation, AML with maturation, Acute myelomonocytic leukemia, Acute monocytic leukemia, Acute erythroid leukemia, Acute megakaryocytic leukemia, Acute basophilic leukemia, and Acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis.\n\n\n[0363] \"Treating\" within the context of the invention means an alleviation of symptoms associated with a disorder or disease, or halt of further progression or worsening of those symptoms, or prevention or prophylaxis of the disease or disorder.\n\n\n[0364] The term \"mammal\" includes organisms which express syk and/or JAK. Examples of mammals include mice, rats, cows, sheep, pigs, goats, horses, bears, monkeys, dogs, cats and, preferably, humans. Transgenic organisms which express syk and/or JAK are also included in this definition.\n\n\n[0365] The inventive methods comprise administering an effective amount of a compound or composition described herein to a mammal or non-human animal. As used herein, \n\n \"effective amount\" of a compound or composition of the invention includes those amounts that antagonize or inhibit syk and/or JAK. An amount which antagonizes or inhibits syk and/or JAK is detectable, for example, by any assay capable of determining syk and/or JAK activity, including the one described below as an illustrative testing method. Effective amounts may also include those amounts which alleviate symptoms of a syk and/or JAK associated disorder treatable by inhibiting syk and/or JAK. Accordingly, \"antagonists of syk\" or \"antagonists of JAK\" include compounds which interact with the syk or JAK, respectively, and modulate, e.g., inhibit or decrease, the ability of a second compound, e.g., another syk or JAK ligand, to interact with the syk or JAK, respectively. The syk or JAK binding compounds are preferably antagonists of syk or JAK, respectively. The language \"syk binding compound\" and \"JAK-binding compound\" (e.g., exhibits binding affinity to the receptor) includes those compounds which interact with syk or JAK resulting in modulation of the activity of syk or JAK, respectively, syk and/or JAK binding compounds may be identified using an in vitro (e.g., cell and non-cell based) or in vivo method. A description of in vitro methods are provided below.\n\n\n[0366] The amount of compound present in the methods and compositions described herein should be sufficient to cause a detectable decrease in the severity of the disorder, as measured by any of the assays described in the examples. The amount of syk and/or JAK modulator needed will depend on the effectiveness of the modulator for the given cell type and the length of time required to treat the disorder. In certain embodiments, the compositions of this invention may further comprise another therapeutic agent. When a second agent is used, the second agent may be administered either as a separate dosage form or as part of a single dosage form with the compounds or compositions of this invention. While one or more of the inventive compounds can be used in an application of monotherapy to treat a disorder, disease or symptom, they also may be used in combination therapy, in which the use of an inventive compound or composition (therapeutic agent) is combined with the use of one or more other therapeutic agents for treating the same and/or other types of disorders, symptoms and diseases. Combination therapy includes administration of the two or more therapeutic agents concurrently or sequentially. The agents may be administered in any order. Alternatively, the multiple therapeutic agents can be combined into a single composition that can be administered to the patient. For instance, a single pharmaceutical composition could comprise the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug thereof according to the formula I, another therapeutic agent (e.g., methotrexate) or a \n\n pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier.\n\n\n[0367] The invention comprises a compound having the formula I, a method for making an inventive compound, a method for making a pharmaceutical composition from at least one inventive compound and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient, and a method of using one or more inventive compounds to treat a variety of disorders, symptoms and diseases (e.g., inflammatory, autoimmune, neurological, neurodegenerative, oncology and cardiovascular), such as RA, osteoarthritis, irritable bowel disease IBD, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD and MS. The inventive compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or neutral compositions may be formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier and the resulting composition may be administered in vivo to mammals, such as men, women and animals, to treat a variety of disorders, symptoms and diseases. Furthermore, the inventive compounds can be used to prepare a medicament that is useful for treating a variety of disorders, symptoms and diseases.\n\n\n[0368] All of the compounds of the present invention are either potent inhibitors of syk and/or JAK kinases, exhibiting IC\n50\nS in the respective assay in the range of less than 5 μM, with most being in the nanomolar, and several in the sub-nanomolar, range. In some embodiments, the compounds of the present invention may be \"dual\" syk/JAK inhibitors in that they inhibit both syk and JAK kinase to some degree. In other embodiments, the compounds of the present invention may selectively inhibit syk kinase, but not appreciably inhibit one or more JAK kinases. In other embodiments, the compounds of the present invention may selectively inhibit JAK kinase, but not appreciably inhibit one or more syk kinases.\n\n\nf. Kits\n\n\n[0369] Still another aspect of this invention is to provide a kit comprising separate containers in a single package, wherein the inventive pharmaceutical compounds, compositions and/or salts thereof are used in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers to treat states, disorders, symptoms and diseases where syk and/or JAK plays a role. \n\n EXAMPLES\n\n\n[0370] The following examples are offered to illustrate, but not to limit, the claimed invention.

The in vitro and in vivo human syk activities of the inventive compounds can be determined by various procedures known in the art, such as a test for their ability to inhibit the activity of human plasma syk. The potent affinities for human syk inhibition exhibited by the inventive compounds can be measured by an IC\n50\n value (in nM). The IQo value is the concentration (in nM) of the compound required to provide 50% inhibition of human syk proteolytic activity. The smaller the IC50 value, the more active (potent) is a compound for inhibiting syk activity. \n\n [0707] An in vitro assay for detecting and measuring inhibition activity against syk is as follows:\n\n\nInhibition of svk tyrosine phosphorylation activity\n\n\n[0708] Potency of candidate molecules for inhibiting syk tyrosine phosphorylation activity is assessed by measuring the ability of a test compound to inhibit syk-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of a syk-specifϊc substrate.\n\n\n[0709] SYK tyrosine phosphorylation activity is measured using the LANCE™ Technology developed by Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences (Boston, MA). LANCE™ refers to homogeneous time resolved fluorometry applications using techniques such as time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay (TR-FRET) (see generally for procedures in Perkin Elmer Application Note- How to Optimize a Tyrosine Kinase Assay Using Time Resolved Fluorescence-Based LANCE Detection, wwww.perkinelmer.com/lifesciences). The assay principle involves detection of a phosphorylated substrate using energy transfer from a phosphospecific europium-labeled antibody to streptavidin-allophycocyanin as an acceptor.\n\n\n[0710] To test the ability of candidate molecules to inhibit SYK tyrosine phosphorylation activity, molecules are reconstituted in 30 % DMSO and serially diluted 1 :3 with the final dilution containing DMSO in the absence of the candidate molecule. The final DMSO concentration in the assay is 3%. Kinase assays are performed as a two part reaction. The first reaction is a kinase reaction and which comprises of a candidate molecule, full length active recombinant SYK enzyme (Millipore, CA) and biotin-labeled SYK-specific substrate biotin-DEED YESP-OH. The second reaction involves termination of the kinase reaction and the simultaneous addition of the detection reagents- europium-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine reagent (Eu-W 1024-PY 100, Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) and Streptavidin-Allophycocyanin detection reagent (SA-APC, Prozyme, CA). The kinase reaction is performed in a black U- bottom 96-well microtitre plate. The final reaction volume is 50 μL and contains a final concentration of 1 nM active SYK enzyme, 550 nM SYK-substrate, and 100 μM ATP diluted in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, and ImM DTT. The reaction is allowed to proceed for 1 hour at room temperature. The quench buffer contains 100 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl\n2\n, 20 mM EDTA, 0.02% Brij35, and 0.5% BSA. The detection reagents are added to the reaction mixture at the following dilutions- 1 :500 for Eu-W1024- PYlOO and 1:250 for SA-APC. The kinase reaction is terminated by the addition of 50 μL \n\n quench buffer containing the detection reagents. The detection is allowed to proceed for 1 hr at room temperature. Detection of the phosphorlated substrate in the absence and presence of inhibitors is measured in the TR-FRET instrument, Analyst HT (Molecular Probes, Sunnyvale, CA) and the condition for measurements are set up using CriterionHost Release 2.0 (Molecular Probes, Sunnyvale, CA). The settings used are a follows: excitation 360 nm, emission 665 - 7.5 nm, beam splitter 350 nm 50/50, flash 100 pulses, delay 60 us, integration 400 us, z-height 2 mm. Inhibition of S YK-tyrosine kinase activity is calculated as the maximum response observed in the presence of inhibitor, compared to that in the absence of inhibitor. IC\n50\nS were derived by non-linear regression analysis. [0711] Intracellular phospho-flow cytometry was used to test compound inhibition of Syk activity in intact non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines Ramos and SUDHL-6. 10x 10\n6\n cells in log phase growth were aliqoted; Syk kinase is activated by incubating cells for 10 minutes with 3μg/ml antibody specific to the B cell receptor. Directly following, cells are fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 5 minutes at room temperature, washed in phosphate buffered saline, and then permeablized by incubation for 2 hours in ice cold methanol. Cells are again washed in phosphate buffered saline, then incubated for 30 minutes with antibody specific for phosphorylated Erk (Y204) and BLNK (Y84), which are indicators of Syk kinase activity, and phosphorylated Syk (Y352), a measure of Src family kinase activity. All antibodies used are purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). After incubation with antibodies, cells are again washed and subjected to flow cytometry. Representative data detailing inhibition of B cell receptor singaling by compounds are shown in Table 1 as IC\n5O\n ranges.\n\n\n[0712] The anti-proliferative effects of compounds on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B cell lines SUDHL-4, SUDHL-6, and Toledo was also assessed. SUDHL-4 and SUDHL-6 require B cell receptor signaling for growth and survival, while the Toledo cell line (serving here as a negative control) does not. Cells were aliquoted into each well of a 96-well plate and incubated with increasing concentrations of compound for 72 hours, after which cell survival and proliferation was determined using the MTT assay (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) following protocols supplied by the manufacturer. Data are detailed in Table 2 as IC\n5\no values plus or minus standard deviations from 5 or 6 independent experiments. [0713] Induction of apoptosis in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B cell lines SUDHL-4,\n\n\nSUDHL-6, and Toledo was assessed by measuring the apoptotis marker Caspase 3. Cells were incubated with 1, 3, or lOμM compound for 24, 48, and 72 hours. At the conclusion of \n\n each time point, cells were processed for flow cytometry analysis using the Monoclonal Rabbit Anti-Active Caspase-3 Antibody Kit and related protocols (BD Pharmingen). Data from two independent experiments are presented in Tables 3A and 3B, representing the percent of total cells undergoing apoptosis following incubation with compounds under the indicated conditions.\n\n\n[0714] Syk activity is not only required for B cell signaling, proliferation, and survival, as shown, but is also critical for cellular activation upon cross-linking of the B cell receptor. B cell activation leads to increased cell surface expression of several proteins involved in cell signaling, antigen presentation, and adhesion. Among these, CD80, CD86, and CD69 are commonly measured to determine B cell activation status. Therefore, primary mouse B cells isolated from spleen were aliquoted and incubated with increasing concentrations of compound (0.05 to 2μM) in the presence of goat anti-mouse IgD (eBiosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA) for 20 hours to cross-link the B cell receptor. Following, cells were washed and incubated for 30 minutes on ice with antibodies specific for the CD80, CD86, and CD69 B cell activation markers. B cells were identified from the pooled population by staining with the B cell marker CD45RO. All antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Table 4 depicts the IC\n5O\n range in which these compounds inhibited B cell receptor induced activation of mouse primary B cells.\n\n\n[0715] In the table below, activity in the Syk and/or Jak assays is provided as follows: +++++ = IC\n50\n < 0.0010 μM; ++++ = 0.0010 μM < IC\n50\n < 0.010 μM, +++ = 0.010 μM < IC\n50\n < 0.10 μM, ++ = 0.10 μM < IC\n50\n < 1 μM, + = IC\n50\n > 1 μM..\n\n\nTable 7:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of GPVI-Mediated Platelet Function In Vitro\n\n\n[0716] The ability for candidate molecules to inhibit syk-mediated platelet functions are tested by measuring the inhibition the GPVI-specific agonist Convulxin-induced human platelet calcium-mobilization or aggregation. Calcium-mobilization is assessed in human washed platelets in a 96-well microtiter format. Aggregation is assessed in a 96-well microtiter assay (see generally the procedures in Jantzen, H. M. et al. (1999) Thromb. Hemost. 81: 1 11-117) or standard cuvette light transmittance aggregometry using human platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Inhibition of Convulxin-Mediated Platelet Calcium-Mobilization In Vitro\n\n\n[0717] Inhibition of Convulxin-induced calcium-mobilization was determined in human washed platelets using the FLIRP Calcium 3 Assay Kit (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For preparation of washed platelets, human venous blood is collected from healthy, drug-free volunteers into ACD (85 mM sodium citrate, 111 mM glucose, 71.4 mM citric acid) containing PGI\n2\n (1.25 ml ACD containing 0.2 μM PGI\n2\n final; PGI\n2\n was from Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is prepared by centrifugation at 160 X g for 20 minutes at room temperature. Washed platelets are prepared by centrifuging PRP for 10 minutes at 730 g and resuspending the platelet pellet in CGS (13 mM sodium citrate, 30 mM glucose, 120 mM NaCl; 2 ml CGS/10 ml original blood volume). After incubation at 37 \n0\nC for 15 minutes, the platelets are collected by centrifugation at 730 g for 10 minutes and resuspended at a concentration of 3 X 10\n8\n platelets/ml in Hepes-Tyrode's buffer (10 mM Hepes, 138 mM NaCl, 5.5 mM glucose, 2.9 mM KCl, 12 mM NaHCO\n3\n, pH 7.4). This \n\n platelet suspension is kept >45 minutes at room temperature before use in calcium mobilization assays.\n\n\n[0718] For 96-well plate Calcium-mobilization experiments, equal volumes of 3 X 10\n8\n washed platelets/ml were incubated with equal volumes of Calcium-3 Assay Reagent A resuspended in 1 X Hank's Balanced Salt Solution, pH 7.4, 20 mM Hepes buffer. The total reaction volume of 0.2 ml/well includes 1.5 x 10\n8\n/ml washed platelet/Calcium-3 Assay reagent A mix, 10 μM Eptifibatide (Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc, Cambridge, MA), serial dilutions (1:3) of test compounds in 0.75% DMSO. DMSO alone is added to 1 well of each 8 set to allow for a maximal calcium-mobilization reading. After 20 minutes preincubation at room temperature the 96-well microplate reader is loaded into the FlexStation (Molecular\n\n\nDevices, Sunnyvale, Calif). The FlexStation experimental conditions for measuring Calcium mobilization are set up using SOFTMax Pro. The settings used are detailed below. Fluorescence parameters-assay mode: flex, excitation 485 nM, 525 nM with a cut-off of 515 nM; Parameters- PMT sensitivity- 6, pipette height 230 μl, read time 2 minutes and 40 seconds, read intervals 2 seconds, temperature-23-25°C. After 18 seconds of baseline reading, calcium-mobilization is initiated by the addition of Convulxin to a final concentration of 125 ng/ml. Inhibition of calcium-mobilization was calculated as the maximum response observed in the presence of inhibitor, compared to that in the absence of inhibitor. IC\n50\nS were derived by non-linear regression analysis.\n\n\nInhibition of Convulxin-Mediated platelet Aggregation In Vitro\n\n\n[0719] For preparation of human platelet-rich plasma for aggregation assays, human venous blood was collected from healthy, drug-free volunteers into 0.38 % sodium citrate (0.013 M, pH 7.0 final). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is prepared by centrifugation of whole blood at 160 x g for 20 minutes at room temperature. The PRP layer is removed, transferred to a new tube, and the platelet count is adjusted, if advantageous, to achieve a platelet concentration of ~3 x 10\n8\n platelets/ml using platelet-poor plasma (PPP). PPP is prepared by centrifugation of the remaining blood sample (after removal of PRP) for 20 minutes at 800 x g. This preparation of PRP can subsequently be used for aggregation assays in either a 96- well plate or standard cuvette aggregometry. \n\n [0720] Inhibition of Convulxin-induced aggregation is determined in 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plates using a microtiter plate shaker and plate reader similar to the procedure described by Frantantoni et al, Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 94, 613 (1990). All steps are performed at room temperature. For 96-well plate aggregation using platelet-rich plasma (PRP), the total reaction volume of 0.2 ml/well includes 190 μl of PRP (~3 x 10\n8\n platelets/ml, see above), and 5 μl of either serial dilution of test compounds in 30% DMSO or buffer (for control wells). After 20 minutes preincubation at room temperature 5 μl of 320 ng/ml Convulxin agonist solution is added to each well to give a final concentration of 8 ng/ml Convulxin. The plates are then agitated for 5 min on a microtiter plate shaker and the 5 minute reading is obtained in the microtitre plate reader (Softmax, Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, Calif.). Aggregation is calculated from the decrease of OD at 650 nm at t=5 minutes. IC\n50\nS were derived by nonlinear regression analysis.\n\n\n[0721] Inhibition of Convulxin-induced aggregation was also determined for cuvette light transmittance aggregation assays, serial dilutions (1:2) of test compounds were prepared in 30% DMSO in a 96 well V-bottom plate (final DMSO concentration in the cuvette was\n\n\n0.3%). The test compound (5 μl of serial dilutions in DMSO) was preincubated with PRP for 20 minutes prior to initiation of aggregation reactions, which is performed in a ChronoLog aggregometer by addition of agonist (125-250 ng/ml Convulxin) to 495 μL of PRP at 37\n0\nC. The aggregation reaction is recorded for 4 min, and maximum extent of aggregation is determined by the difference in extent of aggregation at baseline, compared to the maximum aggregation that occurs during the 4 minute period of the assay. Inhibition of aggregation was calculated as the maximum aggregation observed in the presence of inhibitor, compared to that in the absence of inhibitor. IC\n5\noS were derived by non-linear regression analysis.\n\n\n[0722] Examples of compounds and their syk and PRP IC\n5O\n values are given in tables 1-5. Calcium flux assay in Ramos cells induced by BCR cross-linking\n\n\n[0723] Ramos cells (2G6.4C10, Burkitt's lymphoma, ATCC Item Number: CRL-1923) are sub-cultured at 5 xlO\n5\n cells/ml in fresh medium 3 or 4 days ahead of experiments. Cells are harvest and re-suspend in fresh medium at 8 x 10\n6\n cells/ml before dye-loading. An equal volume of Calcium 3 loading dye (Molecular Device) is added and mixed into cell suspension. Loading cells are dispensed in a 96 well plate and incubated 30 min.\n\n\nCompounds are then added in the dye-loaded cells and incubated for another 30 min. Spin cell down at 1000 rpm for 3 min before fluorescence measurement in FlexStation. BCR \n\n stimulation is carried by the addition of 5 μg/ml antibody (AffiniPure F(ab')\n2\n fragment Donkey anti-human IgM, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboraotries).\n\n\nCalcium flux assay in Jurkat cells induced by TCR cross-linking [0724] The protocol is very similar to B cell calcium flux as described in the previous section. The only differences are that T cells (clone E6-1, Acute T cell Leukemia, ATCC Item Number: Tib- 152) and anti-human CD3 (Functional Grade Purified anti-human CD3, clone OKT3, eBioscience, No. 16-0037) replaced B cells and anti-human IgM. Cell density is kept the same but antibody is used at a concentration of 100 ng/ml.\n\n\nIL-2 secretion in Jurkat cells induced by TCR cross-linking\n\n\n[0725] Jurkat cell propagation and compound incubation procedures are the same as described in Jurkat calcium flux assay in the previous section. Antibody (anti CD3, OKT3) is coated onto a fresh plate (without cells) at 100 ng/well. Cells are suspended at 8 x 10\n6\n cells/ml and incubated with compounds for 30 min in a separate plate. At the end of incubation, cells are transferred to the antibody-coated plate and incubated for 16 hours. 100 μl of cell medium after incubation is used for IL-2 measurement after incubation. IL-2 level is determined using an IL-2 ELISA kit (Human IL-2 ELISA kit II, BD Bioscience, No. 55061 1).\n\n\nExample 333 Millipore Upstate KinaseProfiler™ screening\n\n\n[0726] This assay is a direct measurement of the effect of compound on the catalytic activity of JAK3. Purified human JAK3 (GenBank AF513860) sequence (residue 781 - C terminus) was obtained from insect cells. The catalytic hydrolysis of ATP is measured using a radiometric filter binding method. Incubation of kinase with \n33\n [P]ATP and substrate leads to incorporation of \n33\n [P] into the substrate which can then be separated from the other reaction components by filtration. Assays were performed using 10 μM ATP and in the absence or presence of 1, 0.3, or 0.1 μM compound. Activity was expressed as % of inhibition of control.\n\n\nTable 8: Inhibition (%) of catalytic activity of JAK3 by 1, 0.3 or 0.1 μM compound as determined by Millipore using their KinaseProfiler Assay. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nND: not done\n\n\nExample 334 Ambit KinomeScan screening\n\n\n[0727] This assay is an ATP-site dependent competition binding assay in which human kinases of interest are fused to a proprietary tag (T7 bacteriophage). The amount of kinase bound to an immobilized, active-site directed ligand is measured in the presence and absence of the test compound. Ambit's JAK assays use kinase domains and not full-length proteins. The domain used for JAKl binding is the pseudo kinase domain while that for JAK3 binding is the catalytic domain (Mazen W Karaman, Sanna Herrgard, Daniel K Treiber, et. al. A Quantitative analysis of kinase inhibitotr selectivity. Nature Biotechnology, 2008, Volume 26, No. 1, Page 127-132).\n\n\nTable 9a: KD values (nM) for compound binding inhibition of JAKl and JAK3 to immobilized ligand in the Ambit KinomeScan assay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 9b Potency and Specificity of Kinase Inhibtion (IC50 in nM) \n\n\n\n\n\nTable 10: (Ambit Panel) inhibition of Kinases in Kd (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 335 JAK3/STAT6 cellular assay\n\n\n[0728] Stimulation of Ramos B cells by interleukin 4 (IL4) leads to signaling through JAK1/JAK3 resulting in phosphorylation of STAT6 (signal transducers and activators of transcription). The effect of compounds on inhibition of JAK3 and/or JAKl can be assessed by measuring the amount of phosphorylated STAT6. This is performed by Western blotting using a specific phospho-STAT6 antibody.\n\n\n[0729] Ramos B cells were suspended in 10 mM Hepes-buffered RPMI media (2 x 10\n7\n cells/ml). Cells (90 μl) were incubated with 10 μl 3.3 μg/ml interleukin 4 (R & D Systems Inc, cat # 204-IL; final concentration: 0.33 μg/ml). Incubations were for 10 min at 37° C in the absence or presence of 2 μl compound diluted in 30 % DMSO. Reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2x lysis buffer (100 mM TRIS-HCl pH 8.0, 2 % Triton- X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 250 mM NaCl, 20 % glycerol, 1.25 mM PMSF, 5 mM sodium \n\n orthovandate, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, mini complete EDTA protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)).\n\n\n[0730] Samples were incubated with 1 μl of the nuclease, benzonase (Novagen, cat # 71205-3) for 1 hour, room temperature and then 50 μl 5x loading buffer (330 mM TRIS pH 6.8, 9.5 % SDS, 34 % glycerol, 0.01 % bromophenol blue, 10 % beta-mercaptoethanol) was added.\n\n\n[0731] Cell lysates (15 μL) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (No vex 4-12 % TRIS-glycine gels, Invitrogen) under reducing conditions, followed by electroblot-transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then incubated in Zymed blocking buffer (Invitrogen) for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) then overnight at 4° C with 1:500 anti phosphotyrosine- STAT6 (Cell Signaling Technology, cat # 9364) primary antibody in Zymed blocking buffer. Following 5 x 10 min washes with Tris-buffered saline, 0.25 % NP40 (TBSN), blots were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature in the presence of 1: 10,000 HRP-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences, cat # NA934V) in Zymed blocking buffer. After 4 x 10 min TBSN washes, blots were visualized by ECL (Pierce Western Lightening, Perkin Elmer cat # NELlOl). In order to determine total β3 content, blots were stripped, washed 4 x with TBSN, and re-probed with 1:2000 C3A antibody in block buffer overnight at 4° C. After 4 x 10 min TBSN washes, blots were incubated with 1: 10,000 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody in blocking buffer, washed 4 more times with TBSN and exposed to Western Lightening reagent. Levels of stimulation over background and the extent of inhibition of compound are determined by densitometry.\n\n\nExample 336 Inhibition of JAK kinase activity assay for Ramos B-cell Line Stimulated with IL-4\n\n\n[0732] These examples illustrate methods for evaluating the in vitro and in vivo human JAK kinase activities of the inventive compounds can be determined by various procedures known in the art, such as a test for their ability to inhibit the activity of human plasma JAK kinase. The potent affinities for human JAK kinase inhibition exhibited by the inventive compounds can be measured by an IC\n50\n value (in nM). The IC\n50\n value is the concentration (in nM) of the compound required to provide 50% inhibition of human JAK kinase activity. \n\n The smaller the IC\n50\n value, the more active (potent) is a compound for inhibiting JAK kinase activity.\n\n\n[0733] An in vitro assay for detecting and measuring inhibition activity against JAK kinase is as follows: [0734] The activity of the compounds for JAK kinases is confirmed in cellular assays designed to test for JAK inhibition. Briefly, JAK inhibition is tested in human Ramos B-cells activated with cytokine Interleukin-4 (IL-4). Twenty to 24 hours post stimulation, the cells are stained for upregulation of CD23 and analyzed by FACS. Stimulation of the B-cells with IL-4 leads to the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway through phosphorylation of the JAK kinase JAKl and JAK3, which in turn phosphorylate and activate transcription of factors STAT-5 and STAT-6. The low-affinity IgE receptor (CD23) is upregulated by activated STAT-5.\n\n\n[0735] For the assay, human Ramos B-cells (ATCC, Catalog No. CRL- 1596) are cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro, Catalog No. 10-040-CM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH, Catalog No. 12106-500M) according to the propagation protocol supplied with the cells, and maintained at a density of approximately 3.5 X 10\n5\n cells/ml. The day before the assay, the cells are diluted to 3.5 X 10\n5\n cells/ml to insure they are in the logorithmic growth phase. The cells are spun down, and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Cellgro, MediaTech, Inc., Herndon, Va., Cat No. 10-040-CM) containing 5-10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), heat inactivated (JRH Biosciences, Inc, Lenexa, Kans., Cat No. 12106-500M) according to ATCC propagation protocol. Cells are maintained at a density of 3.5 X 10\n4\"5\n cells/ml. The day before the experiment, Ramos B-cells are diluted to 3.5 X 10\n5\n cells/mL to ensure that they are in a logarithmic growth phase and aliquots dispensed into a 96-well tissue culture plate. Cells are incubated with test compound (dissolved in DMSO) or DMSO (control) for 1 hr at 37° C. and then stimulated with IL-4 (Pepotech, Catalog No. 200-04) for 20-24 hours (final concentration is 50 Units/ml).\n\n\n[0736] Cells are spun down and suspended in RPMI with 5% serum. 5X10\n4\n cells are used per point in a 96-well tissue culture plate. Cells are pre-incubated with compound or DMSO (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., Cat No. D2650) vehicle control for 1 hour in a 37° C. incubator. Cells are then stimulated with EL-4 (Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ. , Cat No. 200- 04) for a final concentration of 50 units/mL for 20-24 hours. Cells are then spun down and stained with anti-CD23-PE(BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif., Cat No. 55571 1) and \n\n analyzed by FACS. Detection is performed using a BD LSR I System Flow Cytometer, purchased from Becton Dickinson Biosciences of San Jose, Calif. \\\n\n\n[0737] Proliferation is measured using CellTiter-Glo.RTM. Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega), which determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, as an indicator of metabolically active cells. The substrate is thawed and allowed to come to room temperature. After mixing the Cell Titer-Glo reagent and diluent together, 100 μL is added to each well. The plates are mixed on an orbital shaker for two minutes to induce lysis and incubated at room temperature for an additional ten minutes to allow the signal to equilibrate. Detection is performed using a Wallac Victor2 1420 multilabel counter purchased from Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn.\n\n\n[0738] On day two, A549 cells are pre-incubated with a 2,4-pyrimidinediamine test compound or DMSO (control) (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., Catalog No. D2650) for 1 hour. The cells are then stimulated with EFNγ (75 ng/mL) (Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ. , Cat. No. 300-02) and allowed to incubate for 24 hours. The final test compound dose range is 30 μM to 14 nM in 200 μL F12K media containing 5% FBS, 0.3% DMSO.\n\n\n[0739] On day three, the cell media is removed and the cells are washed with 200 μL PBS (phosphate buffered saline). Each well is trypsinized to dissociate the cells, then neutralized by addition of 200 μL complete F12K media. Cells are pelleted and stained with an APC conjugated mouse anti-human ICAM-I (CD54) (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif., Catalog #559771) antibody for 20 minutes at 4° C. Cells are washed with ice cold FACS buffer\n\n\n(PBS+2% FBS) and surface ICAM-I expression is analyzed by flow cytometry. Detection is performed using a BD LSR I System Flow Cytometer, purchased from BD Biosciences of San Jose, Calif. Events are gated for live scatter and the geometric mean is calculated (Becton-Dickinson CellQuest software version 3.3, Franklin Lakes, NJ. ). Geometric means are plotted against the compound concentration to generate a dose response curve.\n\n\nExample 337: Inhibition of Syk-mediated signal transduction through the B cell receptor in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines.\n\n\n[0740] Cells were pre-treated for 1 hour without or with compound (0.02 to 2uM) prior to stimulation of B cell receptor singling by incubation of cells with 3μg/ml anti-mu antibody for 10 minutes at 37\n0\nC. Ca\n2+\n flux was measured using the Calcium 3 loading dye and the FlexStation (Molecular Device). B cell receptor signaling was assayed by intracellular phospho-Flow Cytometry, following protocols supplied by BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). \n\n Syk activation was measured by induction of BLNK tyrosine phosphorylation at amino acid position 84 (pBLNK Y84) and induction of ERK1/2 tyrosine phosphorylation at amino acid position 204 (pERK Y204). Activation of the Src family member Lyn was measured by induction of Syk tyrosine phosphorylation at amino acid position 352 (pSyk Y352). Data are presented as μM IC\n50\nS. Each compound effectively inhibited B cell receptor-induced Ca\n2+\n fluxing and activation of Syk, but not the Src family member Lyn.\n\n\nExample 338: Syk inhibition exerts an anti-proliferative effect on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines. [0741] Cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of each compound, then evaluated at 72 hours for extent of proliferation using the MTT assay (company, city, state) following the manufacturer supplied protocol. Data are presented as μM IC50 values, representing the mean plus/minus standard deviation from 5 or 6 independent experiments. Each compound inhibited proliferation of SUDHL-4 and -6 cell lines, which rely on Syk for survival and growth signals, in the low μM range. Toledo cells which do not require Syk, was noticeably less sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of Syk inhibition.\n\n\nExample 339: Syk inhibition induces apoptosis in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines.\n\n\n[0742] Data represent two independent experiments to evaluate the effect of Syk and Syk/JAK inhibition on survival of diffuse large non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B cell lines. SUDHL-4 and SUDHL-6 cells lines rely on Syk-mediated B cell receptor signaling for survival, while Toledo cells do not. Cells were incubated with compounds at the indicated concentrations and times; induction of apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using the Caspase 3 Detection Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Luis, MO). Data are presented as the percent of total cells positive for the apoptosis marker, caspase 3. As expected, Syk inhibition resulted in the induction of apoptosis in SUDHL-4 and -6 cell lines, but not the Toledo cell line.\n\n\nExample 340: Inhibition of mouse primary B cell activation by Syk inhibitors\n\n\n[0743] Mouse primary splenocytes were pre-treated for 1 hour with increasing concentrations of each compound (0.05-2μM) prior to addition of control or goat anti-mouse IgD serum. Anti-IgD induced B cell activation was measured 16 hours later by flow cytometry, staining for the activation markers CD80/86 and CD69.\n\n\nExample 341: Mouse model of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia \n\n [0744] Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is caused by antibodies directed against platelet surface glycoproteins, antibodies against drug-containing complexes on the platelet surface, or by antibody-coated cells or immune complexes that interact with the platelet surface. Select compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit platelet clearance in a mouse model of antibody-mediated thrombocytopenia. In this model, a rapid clearance of circulating platelets (approximately 50%) results from the intravenous administration of a rat anti-mouse GPIIb (clone MWReg30) antibody (BD Biosciences, Pharmingen). To evaluate capacity for inhibition of platelet clearance, compounds were suspended into 0.5% methycellulose in water and administered via oral gavage (100 ul/mouse) at a time prior to antibody injection when the compound would achieve maximum plasma concentration (typically 1 - 2 hours based on separate pharmacokinetic experiments for individual compounds). At 4 and 8 hours after injection of antibody, terminal blood samples were obtained from groups of vehicle and test article treated mice (n=5 -10 mice/group) via cardiac puncture. Blood was anticoagulated using trisodium citrate or EDTA. Whole blood samples were measured for platelet counts on a hematology analyzer (Hemavet, Drew Scientific).\n\n\nRemaining blood was processed for plasma and compound concentrations measured by mass spectrometry.\n\n\n[0745] Platelet clearance was determined by measuring the difference in platelet number between the average non-antibody treatment group and animals administered the rat anti- mouse GPIIb antibody. Inhibition of platelet clearance was determined by comparing the difference between platelet clearance of vehicle and compound treated animals.\n\n\nExample 342: Mouse model of collagen antibody induced arthritis\n\n\n[0746] The inhibitory activity of select compounds was investigated in a mouse model of collagen antibody induced arthritis (CAIA). Collagen induced arthritis is mediated by autoantibodies to type II collagen and complement, thus arthritis can be induced by administration of polyclonal antibodies or a mixture of monoclonal antibodies to type II collagen. The CAIA model (Chondrex, Inc., Redmond, WA) uses a mixture of 4 clones which recognize individual epitopes clustered within an 83 amino acid peptide fragment of type II collagen. These epitopes share common amino acid sequences with many different species of type II collagen including chicken, mouse, rat, bovine, porcine, monkey and human. The model utilizes a monoclonal antibody cocktail followed by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce a severe and consistent arthritis in mice within 7 days. \n\n This model was developed based on the hypothesis that bacterial toxins absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract play a synergistic and pathologic role with autoantibodies to type II collagen in triggering arthritis in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.\n\n\n[0747] For these experiments, the monoclonal antibody cocktail (Lot # OC-708) was injected intravenously via tail vein at a dose of 4 mg/mouse (40 mg/ml) on day 0 followed by intraperitoneal injection of LPS diluted into normal saline at a dose of 25 ug/mouse in 8 week old, female Balb/C mice (Charles River, Inc.). Dosing of test articles was started just before or after the IV injection of antibody cocktail. Compounds were suspended into 0.5% methylcellulose in water and administered via oral gavage (100 ul/mouse) daily for the duration of the 7 - 10 day study. Clinical inflammation scores were obtained daily.\n\n\nInhibition of clinical inflammation scores was determined based on the difference between vehicle and test article treated mice at the end of the experiment. Plasma concentrations represent peak concentration at 1 hour post last dose on the day of study termination.\n\n\nExample 343: Inhibition of IL-4 induced JAK 1/3 to Stat-6 phosphorylation in Ramos B cells [0748] Ramos B cells were pre-treated for 1 hour with increasing concentrations of compound, as indicated prior to addition of IL-4. Cells were incubated with EL-4 for 10 minutes, and then subjected to intracellular flow cytometry to measure the percent inhibition of IL-4 induced Stat-6.\n\n\nExample 344: Inhibition of IL-4 induced JAK1/3 to Stat-6 phosphorylation in Ramos B cells [0749] Ramos B cells were pre-treated for 1 hour with increasing concentrations of compound, as indicated prior to addition of IL-4. Cells were incubated with IL-4 for 10 minutes, and then subjected to intracellular flow cytometry to measure the percent inhibition of IL-4 induced Stat-6.\n\n\nExample 345: Primary Human T-cell Proliferation Assay Stimulated with IL-2 [0750] Primary human T-cells derived from peripheral blood and pre-activated through stimulation of the T-cell receptor and CD28 proliferate in vitro in response to the cytokine Interleukin-2 (IL-2). This proliferative response is dependent on the activation of JAK-I and JAK-3 tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate and activate the transcription factor Stat-5.\n\n\n[0751] Human primary T cells are prepared as follows. Whole blood is obtained from a healthy volunteer, mixed 1: 1 with PBS, layered on to Ficoll Hypaque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J., Catalog #17-1440-03) in 2: 1 blood/PBS :ficoll ratio and \n\n centrifuged for 30 min at 4° C. at 1750 rpm. The lymphocytes at the serum: fϊcoll interface are recovered and washed twice with 5 volumes of PBS. The cells are resuspended in Yssel's medium (Gemini Bio-products, Woodland, Calif., Catalog #400-103) containing 40 U/mL recombinant IL2 (R and D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., Catalog #202-IL (20 μg)) and seeded into a flask pre-coated with 1 μg/mL anti-CD3 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif., Catalog #555336) and 5 μg/mL anti-CD28 (Immunotech, Beckman Coulter of Brea Calif., Catalog #IM1376). The primary T-cells are stimulated for 3 to 4 days, then transferred to a fresh flask and maintained in RPMI with 10% FBS and 40 U/mL IL-2.\n\n\n[0752] Primary T-cells are washed twice with PBS to remove the EL-2 and resuspended in Yssel's medium at 2X 10\n6\n cells/mL. 50 μL of cell suspension containing 80 U/mL IL-2 is added to each well of a flat bottom 96 well black plate. For the unstimulated control, IL-2 is omitted from the last column on the plate. Compounds are serially diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.7% pure, cell culture tested, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., Catalog No. D2650) from 5 mM in 3-fold dilutions and then diluted 1:250 in Yssel's medium. 50 μL of 2X compound is added per well in duplicate and the cells are allowed to proliferate for 72 hours at 37° C.\n\n\n[0753] Proliferation is measured using CellTiter-Glo.RTM. Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega), which determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present, as an indicator of metabolically active cells. The substrate is thawed and allowed to come to room temperature. After mixing the Cell Titer-Glo reagent and diluent together, 100 μL is added to each well. The plates are mixed on an orbital shaker for two minutes to induce lysis and incubated at room temperature for an additional ten minutes to allow the signal to equilibrate. Detection is performed using a Wallac Victor2 1420 multilabel counter purchased from Perkin Elmer, Shelton, Conn. Example 346. A549 Epithelial Line Stimulated with IFNγ\n\n\n[0754] A549 lung epithelial cells up-regulate ICAM-I (CD54) surface expression in response to a variety of different stimuli. Therefore, using ICAM-I expression as readout, compound effects on different signaling pathways can be assessed in the same cell type. IFNγ up- regulates ICAM-I through activation of the JAK/Stat pathway. In this example, the up- regulation of ICAM-I by IFNγ is assessed. \n\n [0755] The A549 lung epithelial carcinoma cell line originated from the American Type Culture Collection. Routine culturing is with F12K media (Mediatech Inc., Lenexa, Kans., Cat. No. 10-025-CV) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 LU. penicillin and 100 ng/mL streptomycin (complete F12k media). Cells are incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n2\n at 37° C. Prior to use in the assay, A549 cells are washed with PBS and trypsinized (Mediatech Inc., Cat. No. 25-052-CI) to lift the cells. The trypsin cell suspension is neutralized with complete F12K media and centrifuged to pellet the cells. The cell pellet is resuspended in complete F12K media at a concentration of 2.0X 10\n5\n/mL. Cells are seeded at 20,000 per well, 100 μL total volume, in a flat bottom tissue culture plate and allowed to adhere overnight.\n\n\n[0756] On day two, A549 cells are pre-incubated with a 2,4-pyrimidinediamine test compound or DMSO (control) (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., Catalog No. D2650) for 1 hour. The cells are then stimulated with IFNγ (75 ng/mL) (Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, N.J., Cat. No. 300-02) and allowed to incubate for 24 hours. The final test compound dose range is 30 μM to 14 nM in 200 μL F12K media containing 5% FBS, 0.3% DMSO.\n\n\n[0757] On day three, the cell media is removed and the cells are washed with 200 μL PBS (phosphate buffered saline). Each well is trypsinized to dissociate the cells, then neutralized by addition of 200 μL complete F12K media. Cells are pelleted and stained with an APC conjugated mouse anti-human ICAM-I (CD54) (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, Calif., Catalog #559771 ) antibody for 20 minutes at 4° C. Cells are washed with ice cold FACS buffer\n\n\n(PBS+2% FBS) and surface ICAM-I expression is analyzed by flow cytometry. Detection is performed using a BD LSR I System Flow Cytometer, purchased from BD Biosciences of San Jose, Calif. Events are gated for live scatter and the geometric mean is calculated (Becton-Dickinson CellQuest software version 3.3, Franklin Lakes, N. J.). Geometric means are plotted against the compound concentration to generate a dose response curve.\n\n\nExample 347. U937 IFNγlCAMl FACS Assay\n\n\n[0758] LJ937 human monocytic cells up-regulate ICAM-I (CD54) surface expression in response to a variety of different stimuli. Therefore, using ICAM-I expression as readout, compound effects on different signaling pathways can be assessed in the same cell type. IFNγ up-regulates ICAM-I through activation of the JAK/Stat pathway. In this example, the up- regulation of ICAM-I by IFNγ is assessed. \n\n [0759] The U937 human monocytic cell line is obtained from ATCC of Rockville, Md., catalog number CRL-1593.2, and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) FCS. U937 cells are grown in 10% RPMI. The cells are then plated at a concentration of 100,000 cells per 160 μL in 96 well flat bottom plates. The test compounds are then diluted as follows: 10 mM test compound is diluted 1:5 in DMSO (3 μL 10 mM test compound in 12 μL DMSO), followed by a 1:3 serial dilution of test compound in DMSO (6 μL test compound serially diluted into 12 μL DMSO to give 3-fold dilutions). Then 4 μL of test compound is transferred to 76 μL of 10% RPMI resulting in a 1OX solution (100 μM test compound, 5% DMSO). For control wells, 4 μL of DMSO is diluted into 76 μL 10% RPMI. [0760] The assay is performed in duplicate with 8 points (8 3-fold dilution concentrations from 10 μL) and with 4 wells of DMSO only (control wells) under stimulated conditions and 4 wells of DMSO only under unstimulated conditions.\n\n\n[0761] The diluted compound plate is mixed 2X using a multimek (Beckman Coulter of Brea, Calif.) and then 20 μL of the diluted compounds is transferred to the 96 well plate containing 160 μL of cells, which are then mixed again twice at low speeds. The cells and compounds are then pre-incubated for 30 minutes at 37° C with 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n[0762] The 1OX stimulation mix is made by preparing a 100 ng/mL solution of human EFNγ in 10% RPMI. The cells and compound are then stimulated with 20 μL of IFNγ stimulation mix to give a final concentration of 10 ng/mL IFNγ, 10 μM test compound, and 0.5% DMSO. The cells are kept under conditions for stimulation for 18-24 hours at 37° C with 5% CO\n2\n.\n\n\n[0763] The cells are transferred to a 96 well round bottom plate for staining and then kept on ice for the duration of the staining procedure. Cells are spun down at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4° C, following which the supernatant is removed. Following removal of the supernatant, 1 μL APC conjugated mouse anti-human ICAM-I antibody is added per 100 μL FACS buffer. The cells are then incubated on ice in the dark for 30 minutes. Following incubation, 150 μL of FACS buffer is added and the cells are centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4° C, following which the supernatant is removed. After removal of the supernatant, 200 μL of FACS buffer is added and the cells are resuspended. After suspension, the cells are centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4° C. Supernatant is then removed prior to resuspension of the cells in 150 μL FACS buffer. \n\n [0764] Detection is performed using a BD LSR I System Flow Cytometer, purchased from BD Biosciences of San Jose, Calif. The live cells are gated for live scatter and the geometric mean of ICAM-APC is measured (Becton-Dickinson CellQuest software version 3.3, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). Both % live cells and ICAM-I expression is analyzed. The assays for the test compounds is carried out in parallel with a control compound of known activity. The EC\n5O\n for the control compound is typically 40-100 nM.\n\n\nExample 348. Analysis of B cell signaling:\n\n\n[0765] The human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B cell lines SUDHL-4 (#ACC 495), SUDHL-6 (#ACC572), and Karpas-422 (#ACC32) were obtained from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany); Toledo (#CRL-2631) and Ramos (#CRL-1596) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). All cells were maintained in RPMI media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (ATCC) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and maintained in a 37°C humidified tissue culture incubator. Antibodies used in these studies include polyclonal goat F(ab)'2 anti-human IgG (H+L) and anti-human IgM (BioSource, Camarillo, CA); rabbit anti-human Syk, rabbit anti- human phospho-Syk (Y525/526), rabbit anti-human phospho- Syk (Y352), anti-human BLNK, anti-human phospho-BLNK (Y84) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies, Inc. (Danvers, MA). The following antibodies were obtained from Becton Dickenson (San Jose, CA) for phospho-flow cytometry: Alexa fluor 488-conjugated mouse anti-human phospho-STAT6 (Y641), Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse anti-human phospho-Zap70 (Y319)/Syk(Y352), and Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-human phospho-ERKl/2 (T202/Y204).\n\n\n[0766] Phospho-flow cytometry was performed essentially as described elsewhere (Irish, Czerwinski et al. Blood 108(9): 3135-42 (2006). 0.5x106 cells in growth media were stimulated with lμg/ml anti-μ or anti-γ antibody for 10 minutes. Induced signaling was terminated immediately following the indicated time by the addition of paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) to a final concentration of 1%. Cells were incubated with paraformaldehyde for 5 minutes at room temperature, washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), then resuspended and incubated overnight at 4°C in pre- chilled methanol (-80\n0\nC) (company, address). Fixed and permeablized cells were subsequently washed once in PBS, a second time in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and then stained with the indicated \n\n antibodies diluted 1:20 in PBS + 1% BSA. After 30 minutes, cells were washed once in PBS and subjected to flow cytometry using the FACS Calibur (Becton Dickenson). For Western blot analyses, 106 cells were stimulated for 30 minutes with 2μg/ml of the indicated BCR- specifϊc antibodies. Signaling was terminated by resuspending the cells in lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 1 hour. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and the cleared protein lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and probed with the indicated antibodies following recommendations made by the manufacturers. Where indicated, cells were pre- treated for 1 hour at 37°C with Syk inhibitors or vehicle control (0.5% DMSO) at several concentrations prior to stimulation with anti-BCR antibody. Example 349. Selective inhibition of Syk activity.\n\n\n[0767] Compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit purified Syk. P459-72 and P505-15 (two compounds from a Syk-specifϊc series as shown in Table 9b) and example 100b (from a series with dual Syk and JAK inhibitory activities) were found to suppress Syk kinase activity with IC50s of 43nM, 6nM, and 31 nM, respectively. The selectivity of these compounds for Syk was determined by screening each against a panel of 270 independent purified kinases at 30OnM (Millipore). The percent inhibition relative to vehicle control was calculated, and the numbers were converted into a heat-map; no inhibition is represented as green, increasing blending with red indicates increasing percent inhibition with yellow representing 50% inhibition and red representing 100% inhibition (Figure 8). As depicted in Figure 8A, P459-72 and P505-15 were highly Syk specific (first and second rows, respectively) whereas example 100b inhibited multiple kinases (third row). The subset of kinases that were inhibited by >80% by any of the three compounds are shown in Figure 8B. example 100b inhibited Syk and MLK-I (first row). At 30OnM P505-15 inhibited 10 different kinases (second row). When re-tested at 5OnM (approximately 10x above its Syk IC50 value of 6nM), however, Syk was the only kinase that remained inhibited (third row). P420-89 inhibited Syk, JAK2 and JAK3, along with several other kinases (fourth row).\n\n\n[0768] Employing the Milipore panel of purified kinases P5O5-15 (IC\n5O\n = InM) inhibited 98% of purified Syk kinase activity at 5OnM. IC50 values were determined for those kinases that were inhibited by >80% at 30OnM in the Millipore kinase panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0769] By contrast, multi-kinase inhibitor P420-89 is more akin to Rigel's R788. At 30OnM, P420-89 inhibited Syk by 88%, along with >80% inhibition of 32 additional kinases. Among these were JAK 2 and 3 (93% and 85% inhibited, respectively), Flt-3 (83-92% inhibited), and cKit (95-97% inhibited), all targets for therapeutic manipulation of lymphocyte function.\n\n\nExample 350. Calcium flux assay and Selective inhibition of Syk in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B cell lines.\n\n\n[0770] Ramos cells were cultured (maintaining approximately 0.5 xl06 cells/ml) in growth medium 3 to 4 days ahead of experiments. Cells were harvested and re-suspended in fresh medium at 8x106 cells/ml before dye-loading. An equal volume of Calcium 3 loading dye (Molecular Device, Sunneyvale, CA) was added to the cell suspensions. Loaded cells were dispensed in a 96 well plate and incubated for 20 minutes. Syk inhibitors were then added to the loaded cells and incubated for another 30 minutes. B cells were stimulated with 5μg/ml anti-μ antibody. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured using the FlexSTATion (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).\n\n\n[0771] The selectivity and potency of Syk inhibition in B cells was initially interrogated by Western blot, measuring BCR-mediated induction of pSyk Y525/526 and pBLNK Y84, both measures of Syk kinase activity, and the induction of pSyk Y352, a measure of Src kinase activity. SUDHL-6 B cells were stimulated with anti-BCR specific antibody for 30 minutes in the presence or absence of each Syk inhibitor or vehicle control. Treatment with 0.16 or lμM of each compound reduced BCR-induced Syk autophorphorylation (Y525/526) by roughly 40% and 60%, respectively, as estimated by densitometry (data not shown). An \n\n expanded range of concentrations was used to further evaluate the effect of these compounds on BCR induced Syk and Src kinase activity. As shown in Figure 9, A-C, each compound inhibited Syk activity (pBLNK Y84) with IC50 values ranging from 0.16 to lμM, while no effect on Src activity (pSyk Y352) was observed as high as 2.5μM. [0772] The ability of each compound to suppress signaling events more distal to the BCR was also measured. Cells were again stimulated by anti-BCR antibody in the presence or absence of various concentrations of each Syk inhibitor. The induction of pSyk Y352 was measured as a specificity control, while that of pERKl/2 T202/Y204 was used as a measure of more distal Syk-dependent signaling (Jiang, Craxton et al. J Exp Med 188(7): 1297-306 (1998). Figure 12C shows representative FACS plots depicting the effect of the most specific and potent Syk inhibitor of the three, P505-15, on BCR signaling. At 125nM, ERK1/2 activation was completely suppressed, whereas the stimulated cells still stained positive for Syk Y352. This experiment was repeated, in which the effect of all three compounds on Src and Syk activity were determined (Figure 10A). Concentrations of less than 125nM were sufficient to suppress BCR induced Syk signaling to ERK1/2. By contrast, much higher concentrations were required to cause a modest suppression of Src activity; an effect on Src that was not observed by Western blot (Figure 9, A-C). None of these Syk inhibitors suppressed PMA-induced ERK 1/2 tyrosine phosphorylation, demonstrating these compounds do not inhibit signaling events down-stream of PKC. [0773] Whereas P459-72 and P505-15 specifically inhibited Syk in purified and cellular assays, example 100b additionally demonstrated activity against purified JAK kinases. These compounds were tested for inhibition of IL-4 signaling to STAT-6 via JAK 1/3 in B cells, a signaling pathway that does not require Syk. The Syk specific compounds did not suppress IL4 signaling at concentrations as high as 2μM. Conversely, example 100b did suppress IL4 signaling, with an IC50 around 125nM (Figure 10B).\n\n\n[0774] This shows that selective inhibition of Syk suppressed BCR-induced Ca2+ flux in B cells with IC50 values around 10OnM. This suggests that by inhibiting Syk, these compounds suppress the signaling pathway, blocking the cellular response.\n\n\n[0775] Selective inhibition of Syk is sufficient to suppress BCR signaling without affecting Src (Figures 11 and 12) or JAK (Figure 10B). Additionally, P5O5-15 and example 100b equally induced apoptosis in these cells (Figure HB). This data demonstrates the role of Syk \n\n signaling in the survival of NHL cell lines, and demonstrates that inhibition of kinases other than Syk is not required to achieve this effect.\n\n\nExample 351. Caspase 3 and proliferation assays: Syk Inhibition Disrupts Proliferation and Survival of non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma B Cell Lines. [0776] Induction of apoptosis was measured using the PE-conjugated monoclonal active caspase-3 antibody apoptosis kit (Becton Dickenson) following the supplied protocol. Cells were suspended in growth media (0.5x106 cells/ml) and treated with the indicated concentrations of each Syk inhibitor or vehicle control for 24, 48, or 72 hours prior to FACS analysis. The MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a tetrazole) assay (company name) was used as a measure of cell viability and growth, following protocols supplied by the manufacturer. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of each Syk inhibitor or vehicle control for 72 hours.\n\n\n[0777] SUDHL-4 and SUDHL-6 cells were previously classified as \"BCR-type\" (Monti, Savage et al. Blood 105(5): 1851-61 (2005); Polo, Juszczynski et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 104(9): 3207-12 (2007) and sensitive to Syk inhibition by R406 (Chen, Monti et al. 2008). The Toledo and Karpas-422 cell lines that lack BCR and BLNK expression, respectively (Gabay, Ben-Bassat et al. Eur J Haematol 63(3): 180-91 (1999); Sprangers, Feldhahn et al. Oncogene 25(36): 5056-62 (2006), having therefore adapted to survive independent of BCR signals, were insensitive to R406 (Chen, Monti et al. 2008). The proliferation of these cell lines when cultured in the presence or absence of various concentrations of each Syk inhibitor for 72 hours was tested.\n\n\n[0778] Selective inhibition of Syk was sufficient to induce apoptosis in \"BCR-type\" NHL cell lines. Cells were incubated with 1 or 3μM of the inhibitor for 72h. As demonstrated in Figure HA, SUDHL-4 and -6 cells each underwent apoptosis, whereas the Toledo and Karpas-422 cells did not (Figure HA). In replicate experiments, the specific inhibition of Syk by P459-72 and P505-15 induced apoptosis only in the SUDHL and Ramos cell lines. By comparison, example 100b, which potently inhibits Syk and JAK kinases, induced apoptosis in all the \"BCR-type\" cell lines, as well as in Karpas-422 and JJN-3, a multiple myeloma cell line that lacks BCR, and BLNK expression (Sprangers, Feldhahn et al. Oncogene 25(36): 5056-62 (2006). The Toledo cells remained insensitive to all three compounds (Figure HB). In a separate experiment, the SUDHL-6 and Toledo cells were found to be equally sensitive to induction of apoptosis by 72h treatment with lμM PMA. \n\n These data demonstrate the specific requirement of Syk in the survival of certain NHL cell lines.\n\n\nExample 352. Xenograft studies and Tumor and plasma concentration analysis.\n\n\n[0779] Syk Inhibition Protects Against Tumor Formation in a Xenograft Mouse Model. Mice were received (company) and acclimated in-house at least three days prior to use.\n\n\nRamos cells (3x106) were injected subcutaneously into the hind flank area of conscious mice using a 27 gauge needle in an injection volume of less than 0.5ml. Following injection, mice were randomized into treatment groups (n = 15) and dosed twice daily by oral gavage with vehicle or 10, 15, or 20mg/kg of the inhibitor. Body weights were obtained at least once per week and caliper measurements of tumors were determined twice per week beginning when palpable tumorrs were formed until the end of the study. Tumor volume was assessed by caliper measurement using a formula [maximum length x width x height x π/6]. Twice daily dosing of vehicle or the inhibitor continued until the vehicle or any treatment group exhibited tumors that exceeded 1.5 grams in size. At the time of termination (5 weeks post Ramos innoculation) the mice were anesthetized with a ketamine cocktail. A blood sample was obtained for CBC and plasma concentration determination via cardiac puncture and the mice were euthanized via cervical dislocation. Tumors were then be excised and weighed. One half of the tumor was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for determination of concentration of the inhibitor in the tumor tissue and the other half was placed in 10% buffered formalin for histological investigation.\n\n\n[0780] The effect of Syk inhibition on Ramos tumor formation in a xenograft mouse model was assessed. Mice were dosed twice daily with 10, 15, or 20mg/kg P505-15 or vehicle control beginning the day of tumor cell inoculation. Caliper measurements were initiated when tumors began to form, approximately thee weeks post-tumor inoculation, and repeated every third day until termination of the study. The study was terminated when tumor weights began reaching approximately 1.5mg, at which time tumors were excised and weighed. Tumor and plasma samples were subjected to pharmacokinetic analysis.\n\n\n[0781] Each tumor sample was homogenized in 3 ml of saline per gram of tumor using the Kontes® Microtube Pellet Pestle® Rods and Motor (Kimble Chase, Vineland, NJ). Plasma and tumor samples were analyzed for P505-15 concentration using a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS). In brief, plasma and tumor samples were processed in a 96-well Captiva™ filter plate (0.2 μm, Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Aliquots of plasma \n\n and homogenized tumor samples were precipitated with acetonitrile containing 200 ng/mL of:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound A, the internal standard. The mixture was vortexed and refrigerated at 4°C for 30 minutes to allow complete protein precipitation. The mixture was filtered into a 96-well collection plate. The filtrate was injected onto a Sciex API3000 LC/MS/MS equipped with a turbo-ion spray source. P505-15 and Compound A were separated on a Phenomenex Luna 5μ HELIC column (4.6 x 100 mm, 5mm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). A mobile phase gradient mixture of 10% mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water) and 90% mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid in 90% acetonitrile, 10% water) to 65% mobile phase B was programmed over 1.1 minutes followed by a gradient of mobile phase B from 65% to 90% over 0.01 minutes. The peak areas of the m/z 394/360 product ion of P505-15 were measured against those of the m/z 357/295 product ion of Compound A (internal standard) in positive ion mode. The analytical range was 2 to 5000 ng/ml.\n\n\n[0782] Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that at steady-state, tumor concentrations of P505- 15 followed the concentration-time profiles seen with plasma in the 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg dose groups. Nonlinear increases in Cmax, AUC (0-8), and tumor Cmin were observed as the dose was increased, but a dose-proportional increase in plasma Cmin was noted. Mean Cmax and AUC (0-8) in plasma was at least 2-fold greater than that in tumor for all doses examined; however, mean nadir concentrations (Cmin) were higher in tumor than in plasma (Table HA), indicating accumulation of P505-15 in the tumor compartment.\n\n\n \n\n Determined from tumor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 IB\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Nadir (0), 1.5, 4, and 8h samples were taken on the da of harvest following the AM dose. The second dose was not administered on the day of harvest; therefore, pharmacokinetic values above were determined after a single AM dose at steady-state.\n\n\n*Only one tumor sample was available for the 8h time-point and may have been an outlier (tumor concentrations at 8h - 608ng/ml); therefore, pharmacokinetic parameters were determined between 0 to 4h for the 15mg/kg BID P5O5-15 dose group. As a result, AUC (0- 8) and AUC based tumor/plamsa ration for this dose group may be underestimated.\n\n\nThe difference between plasma and tumor Cmin became more prominent as the dose was increased, as indicated by the increase in tumor/plasma ratios determined from Cmin (Table HB). Tumor/plasma ratios determined from Cmax and AUC (0-8) were similar across the various dose groups. Tumor concentrations were sustained above 60, 170, and 64OnM over the entire dosing interval at steady-state for P505-15 at 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg, respectively.\n\n\n[0783] Mice dosed with all three concentrations of P505-15 were protected from Ramos tumor growth in vivo. This was first evident from caliper measurements (data not shown), which revealed a reduced rate of tumor growth in the presence of the Syk inhibitor. Upon study completion, mice were euthanized and tumors excised and weighed. Consistent with caliper measurements, a statistically significant reduction in average tumor weight was achieved in all dosing groups, relative to vehicle control. [0784] The Syk-specific inhibitor P505-15 was also tested for activity in a Ramos tumor mouse xenograft model. At all the concentrations tested, statistically significant reductions in tumor growth were observed in mice dosed BID with P505-15. The lowest concentration tested was 10mg/kg, achieving tumor concentrations ranging from 64 to 14OnM over the course of the day. Suppression of tumor growth at these concentrations in vivo is consistent \n\n with concentrations of <125nM found to suppress BCR-induced Ca2+ flux and distal BCR signaling to pERK Y204 (Figures 12). The selective pharmacological inhibition of Syk results in effects on the proliferations and survival of NHL cell lines. These data suggest that the selective targeting of Syk may similarly have clinical benefit in a variety of B-cell proliferative disorders.\n\n\n[0785] As detailed herein, Syk has been implicated experimentally in B cell development, proliferation, and survival. Moreover, Syk is implicated as an oncogene. Expression of constitutively active Syk in adoptively transferred bone marrow cells induces leukemia in mice, and over-activity of Syk is associated with a variety of lymphomas in humans Given the role of Syk in B cell biology, its selective inhibition may be sufficient to provide clinical benefit in B cell proliferative disorders, while reducing toxicities that may arise due to suppression of other off-target kinases.\n\n\n[0786] The present invention provides a number of embodiments. It is apparent that the examples may be altered to provide other embodiments of this invention.
