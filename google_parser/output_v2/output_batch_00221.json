(canceled) Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to an anti-CGRP antibody for use in the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory pain and/or symptoms of inflammatory pain, and to a method of treating and/or preventing inflammatory pain and/or symptoms of inflammatory pain using an anti-CGRP antibody.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe inflammatory process is a complex series of biochemical and cellular events, activated in response to tissue injury or the presence of foreign substances, which results in swelling and pain (Levine and Taiwo, 1994, Textbook of Pain, 45-56). Arthritic pain is the most common inflammatory pain. Rheumatoid disease is one of the commonest chronic inflammatory conditions in developed countries and rheumatoid arthritis is a common cause of disability. The exact aetiology of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, but current hypotheses suggest that both genetic and microbiological factors may be important (Grennan & Jayson, 1994, Textbook of Pain, 397-407). It has been estimated that almost 16 million Americans have symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) or degenerative joint disease, most of whom are over 60 years of age, and this is expected to increase to 40 million as the age of the population increases, making this a public health problem of enormous magnitude (Houge & Mersfelder, 2002, Ann Pharmacother., 36, 679-686; McCarthy et al., 1994, Textbook of Pain, 387-395). Most patients with osteoarthritis seek medical attention because of the associated pain. Arthritis has a significant impact on psychosocial and physical function and is known to be the leading cause of disability in later life. Ankylosing spondylitis is also a rheumatic disease that causes arthritis of the spine and sacroiliac joints. It varies from intermittent episodes of back pain that occur throughout life to a severe chronic disease that attacks the spine, peripheral joints and other body organs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of inflammatory pain is visceral pain which includes pain associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Visceral pain is pain associated with the viscera, which encompass the organs of the abdominal cavity. These organs include the sex organs, spleen and part of the digestive system. Pain associated with the viscera can be divided into digestive visceral pain and non-digestive visceral pain. Commonly encountered gastrointestinal (G1) disorders that cause pain include functional bowel disorder (FBD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These GI disorders include a wide range of disease states that are currently only moderately controlled, including, in respect of FBD, gastro-esophageal reflux, dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS), and, in respect of IBD, Crohn's disease, ileitis and ulcerative colitis, all of which regularly produce visceral pain. Other types of visceral pain include the pain associated with dysmenorrhea, cystitis and pancreatitis and pelvic pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is a critical medical need to identify new pharmaceutically active compounds that interfere with key steps of the inflammatory pain process and particularly for the treatment and/or prevention of arthritis pain and/or symptoms of arthritis pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly we have found that administration of an anti-CGRP antibody is effective in prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory pain, arthritis pain and in particular osteoarthritis pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) is a 37 amino acid neuropeptide which acts as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It binds with high affinity to the CGRP receptor, Calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR), activating adenylate cyclase and protein kinase A production.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCentrally penetrating spinally administered, small molecule selective CGRP antagonists have been shown to be useful in the treatment of neuropathic and nociceptive pain conditions (Adwanikar et al, Pain 2007) suggesting that removal of endogenous CGRP in the spinal cord has an antinociceptive effect. Additionally intrathecal administration of antiserum against CGRP has been shown to reduce nociceptive behaviour in rodent models of arthritis (Kuraishi, Y., et. al Neurosci. lett (1998) 92, 325-329).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSurprisingly we have found that administration of an anti-CGRP antibody is effective, with a peripheral site of action, in the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory pain and in particular osteoarthritis pain when administered peripherally. This peripheral administration route provides a distinct advantage over the requirement to administer antibodies intrathecally or spinally, a more high risk and inconvenient procedure.\n\n\n \nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides the use of an anti-CGRP antagonist antibody for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory pain and/or symptoms of inflammatory pain, wherein the medicament is prepared to be peripherally administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides a method of prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory pain and/or symptoms of inflammatory pain, in an individual, which comprises peripherally administering to said individual a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-CGRP antagonist antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the anti-CGRP antagonist antibody acts peripherally on administration.\n\n\n \n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n: Osteoarthritis pain model.

Capra, eds., Harwood Academic Publishers, 1995); and Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology (V. T. DeVita et al., eds., J.B. Lippincott Company, 1993).\n\n\n \nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nAn âantibodyâ is an immunoglobulin molecule capable of specific binding to a target, such as a carbohydrate, polynucleotide, lipid, polypeptide, etc., through at least one antigen recognition site, located in the variable region of the immunoglobulin molecule. As used herein, the term encompasses not only intact polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, but also fragments thereof (such as Fab, Fabâ², F(abâ²)\n2\n, Fv, dAb), single chain antibodies (ScFv), mutants thereof, chimeric antibodies, diabodies, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, and any other modified configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that comprises an antigen recognition site. An antibody includes an antibody of any class, such as IgG, IgA, or IgM (or sub-class thereof), and the antibody need not be of any particular class. Depending on the antibody amino acid sequence of the constant domain of its heavy chains, immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1 and IgA2. The heavy-chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu, respectively. The subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known âFvâ is an antibody fragment that contains a complete antigen-recognition and -binding site. In a two-chain Fv species, this region consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight, non-covalent association. In a single-chain Fv species, one heavy and one light chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a dimeric structure analogous to that in a two-chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen-binding specificity on the surface of the VH-VL dimer. However, even a single variable domain (or half of a Fv comprising only 3 CDRs specific for an antigen) has the ability to recognize and bind antigen, although generally at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain (CH1) of the heavy chain. Fabâ² fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge regions. A F(ab)2 fragment is a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody can have one or more binding sites (for combining with antigen). If there is more than one binding site, the binding sites may be identical to one another or may be different. For instance, a naturally-occurring immunoglobulin has two identical binding sites, a single chain antibody or Fab fragment has one binding site, while a âbispecificâ or âbifunctionalâ antibody (diabody) has two different binding sites, in terms of sequence and/or antigen/epitope recognition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn âisolated antibodyâ is an antibody that (1) is not associated with naturally-associated components, including other naturally-associated antibodies, that accompany it in its native state, (2) is free of other proteins from the same species, (3) is expressed by a cell from a different species, or (4) does not occur in nature.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âmonoclonal antibodyâ refers to a homogeneous antibody population wherein the monoclonal antibody is comprised of amino acids (naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring) that are involved in the selective binding of an antigen. A population of monoclonal antibodies is highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. The term âmonoclonal antibodyâ encompasses not only intact monoclonal antibodies and full-length monoclonal antibodies, but also fragments thereof (such as Fab, Fabâ², F(abâ²)\n2\n, Fv), single chain (ScFv), mutants thereof, fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, and any other modified configuration of the immunoglobulin molecule that comprises an antigen recognition site of the required specificity and the ability to bind to an antigen. It is not intended to be limited as regards to the source of the antibody or the manner in which it is made (e.g., by hybridoma, phage selection, recombinant expression, transgenic animals, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âhumanizedâ antibodies refer to forms of non-human (e.g. murine) antibodies that are specific chimeric immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin chains, or fragments thereof (such as Fv, Fab, Fabâ², F(abâ²)\n2 \nor other antigen-binding subsequences of antibodies) that contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a complementarity determining region (CDR) of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, or rabbit having the desired specificity, affinity, and biological activity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, the humanized antibody may comprise residues that are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences, but are included to further refine and optimize antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region or domain (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. Antibodies may have Fc regions modified as described in WO 99/58572. Other forms of humanized antibodies have one or more CDRs (one, two, three, four, five, six) which are altered with respect to the original antibody, which are also termed one or more CDRs âderived fromâ one or more CDRs from the original antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âhuman antibodyâ means an antibody having an amino acid sequence corresponding to that of an antibody produced by a human and/or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies known in the art or disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis definition of a human antibody includes antibodies comprising at least one human heavy chain polypeptide or at least one human light chain polypeptide. One such example is an antibody comprising murine light chain and human heavy chain polypeptides. Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art. In one embodiment, the human antibody is selected from a phage library, where that phage library expresses human antibodies (Vaughan et al., 1996, Nature Biotechnology, 14:309-314; Sheets et al., 1998, PNAS, (USA) 95:6157-6162; Hoogenboom and Winter, 1991, J. Mol. Biol., 227:381; Marks et al., 1991, J. Mol. Biol., 222:581). Human antibodies can also be made by introducing human immunoglobulin loci into transgenic animals, e.g., mice in which the endogenous immunoglobulin genes have been partially or completely inactivated. This approach is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,545,807; 5,545,806; 5,569,825; 5,625,126; 5,633,425; and 5,661,016. Alternatively, the human antibody may be prepared by immortalizing human B lymphocytes that produce an antibody directed against a target antigen (such B lymphocytes may be recovered from an individual or may have been immunized in vitro). See, e.g., Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, Alan R. Liss, p. 77 (1985); Boerner et al., 1991, J. Immunol., 147 (1):86-95; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,373.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA single chain antibody (scFc) is an antibody in which VL and VH regions are paired to form a monovalent molecule via a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain (Bird et al Science, 242: 423-426 (1988) and Huston et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:5879-5883 (1988)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiabodies are bivalent, bispecific antibodies in which VH and VL domains are expressed on a single polypeptide chain, but using a linker that is too short to allow for pairing between the two domains on the same chain, thereby forcing the domains to pair with complementary domains of another chain and creating two antigen binding sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâChimeric antibodiesâ refers to those antibodies wherein one portion of each of the amino acid sequences of heavy and light chains is homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular class, while the remaining segment of the chains is homologous to corresponding sequences in another. Typically, in these chimeric antibodies, the variable region of both light and heavy chains mimics the variable regions of antibodies derived from one species of mammals, while the constant portions are homologous to the sequences in antibodies derived from another. One clear advantage to such chimeric forms is that, for example, the variable regions can conveniently be derived from presently known sources using readily available hybridomas or B cells from non human host organisms in combination with constant regions derived from, for example, human cell preparations. While the variable region has the advantage of ease of preparation, and the specificity is not affected by its source, the constant region being human, is less likely to elicit an immune response from a human subject when the antibodies are injected than would the constant region from a non-human source. However, the definition is not limited to this particular example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âfunctional Fc regionâ possesses at least one effector function of a native sequence Fc region. Exemplary âeffector functionsâ include Cl q binding; complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down-regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor; BCR), etc. Such effector functions generally require the Fc region to be combined with a binding domain (e.g. an antibody variable domain) and can be assessed using various assays known in the art for evaluating such antibody effector functions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA ânative sequence Fc regionâ comprises an amino acid sequence identical to the amino acid sequence of an Fc region found in nature. A âvariant Fc regionâ comprises an amino acid sequence which differs from that of a native sequence Fc region by virtue of at least one amino acid modification, yet retains at least one effector function of the native sequence Fc region. Preferably, the variant Fc region has at least one amino acid substitution compared to a native sequence Fc region or to the Fc region of a parent polypeptide, e.g. from about one to about ten amino acid substitutions, and preferably from about one to about five amino acid substitutions in a native sequence Fc region or in the Fc region of the parent polypeptide. The variant Fc region herein will preferably possess at least about 80% sequence identity with a native sequence Fc region and/or with an Fc region of a parent polypeptide, and most preferably at least about 90% sequence identity therewith, more preferably at least about 95% sequence identity therewith.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein âantibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicityâ and âADCCâ refer to a cell-mediated reaction in which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc receptors (FcRs) (e.g. natural killer (NK) cells, neutrophils, and macrophages) recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. ADCC activity of a molecule of interest can be assessed using an in vitro ADCC assay, such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 or 5,821,337. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and NK cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al., 1998, PNAS (USA), 95:652-656.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âFc receptorâ and âFcRâ describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover, a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody (a gamma receptor) and includes receptors of the FcÎ³RI, FcÎ³RII, and FcÎ³RIII subclasses, including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. FcÎ³RII receptors include FcÎ³RIIA (an âactivating receptorâ) and FcÎ³RIIB (an âinhibiting receptorâ), which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet, 1991, Ann. Rev. Immunol., 9:457-92; Capel et al., 1994, Immunomethods, 4:25-34; and de Haas et al., 1995, J. Lab. Clin. Med., 126:330-41. âFcRâ also includes the neonatal receptor, FcRn, which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus (Guyer et al., 1976, J. Immunol., 117:587; and Kim et al., 1994, J. Immunol., 24:249).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâComplement dependent cytotoxicityâ and âCDCâ refer to the lysing of a target in the presence of complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system (C1q) to a molecule (e.g. an antibody) complexed with a cognate antigen. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay, e.g. as described in Gazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol. Methods, 202:163 (1996), may be performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms âG1â and âantibody G1â are used interchangeably to refer to an antibody produced by the expression vectors having deposit numbers ATCC-PTA-6867 and ATCC-PTA-6866. The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain and light chain variable regions are shown in SEQ ID Nos. 1 and 2. The CDR portions of antibody G1 (including Chothia and Kabat CDRs) are diagrammatically depicted in FIG. 5 of WO2007/054809, the content of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The polynucleotides encoding the heavy and light chain variable regions are shown in SEQ ID Nos. 9 and 10. The characterization of antibody G1 is described in the Examples of WO2007/054809, the entire content of which is herein incorporated by reference. G1 is a humanized monoclonal blocking antibody (IgG2) which blocks binding and activity of the neuropeptide CGRP (a and b) and its effect of neurogenic vasodilatation caused by CGRP release. G1 is an IgG2Îa monoclonal anti-CGRP antagonist antibody derived from the murine anti-CGRP antagonist antibody precursor, denoted muMAb7E9 as identified in a screen using spleen cells prepared from a mouse immunized with human and rat CGRP that were fused with murine plasmacytoma cells. G1 was created by grafting the muMAb 7E9 derived CDRs of light and heavy chain into the closest human germ line sequence followed by the introduction of at least 1 mutation into each CDR and 2 framework mutations in V\nH\n. Two mutations were introduced into the Fc domain of G1 to suppress human Fc-receptor activation. G1 and muMab7E9 have been shown to recognise the same epitope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms âG2â and âantibody G2â are used interchangeably to refer to an anti-rat CGRP mouse monoclonal antibody as described in Wong H C et al. Hybridoma 12:93-106 (1993). The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain and light chain variable regions are shown in SEQ ID Nos. 19 and 20. The polynucleotides encoding the heavy and light chain variable regions are shown in SEQ ID Nos. 27 and 28. The CDR portions of antibody G2 are provided in SEQ ID Nos. 21 to 26. G2 has been shown to recognise the same epitope as G1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âimmunospecificâ binding of antibodies refers to the antigen specific binding interaction that occurs between the antigen-combining site of an antibody and the specific antigen recognized by that antibody (i.e., the antibody reacts with the protein in an ELISA or other immunoassay, and does not react detectably with unrelated proteins).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn epitope that âspecifically bindsâ, or âpreferentially bindsâ (used interchangeably herein) to an antibody or a polypeptide is a term well understood in the art, and methods to determine such specific or preferential binding are also well known in the art. A molecule is said to exhibit âspecific bindingâ or âpreferential bindingâ if it reacts or associates more frequently, more rapidly, with greater duration and/or with greater affinity with a particular cell or substance than it does with alternative cells or substances. An antibody âspecifically bindsâ or âpreferentially bindsâ to a target if it binds with greater affinity, avidity, more readily, and/or with greater duration than it binds to other substances. It is also understood by reading this definition that, for example, an antibody (or moiety or epitope) that specifically or preferentially binds to a first target may or may not specifically or preferentially bind to a second target. As such, âspecific bindingâ or âpreferential bindingâ does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding. Generally, but not necessarily, reference to binding means preferential binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms âpolypeptideâ, âoligopeptideâ, âpeptideâ and âproteinâ are used interchangeably herein to refer to polymers of amino acids of any length. The polymer may be linear or branched, it may comprise modified amino acids, and it may be interrupted by non-amino acids. The terms also encompass an amino acid polymer that has been modified naturally or by intervention; for example, disulfide bond formation, glycosylation, lipidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, or any other manipulation or modification, such as conjugation with a labeling component. Also included within the definition are, for example, polypeptides containing one or more analogs of an amino acid (including, for example, unnatural amino acids, etc.), as well as other modifications known in the art. It is understood that, because the polypeptides of this invention are based upon an antibody, the polypeptides can occur as single chains or associated chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâPolynucleotide,â or ânucleic acid,â as used interchangeably herein, refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, modified nucleotides or bases, and/or their analogs, or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides, such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present, modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non-nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after polymerization, such as by conjugation with a labeling component. Other types of modifications include, for example, âcapsâ, substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoamidates, cabamates, etc.) and with charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (e.g., nucleases, toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, ply-L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelators (e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide(s). Further, any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced, for example, by phosphonate groups, phosphate groups, protected by standard protecting groups, or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides, or may be conjugated to solid supports. The 5â² and 3â² terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping groups moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art, including, for example, 2â²-O-methyl-, 2â²-O-allyl, 2â²-fluoro- or 2â²-azido-ribose, carbocyclic sugar analogs, Î±-anomeric sugars, epimeric sugars such as arabinose, xyloses or lyxoses, pyranose sugars, furanose sugars, sedoheptuloses, acyclic analogs and abasic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include, but are not limited to, embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P(O)S (âthioateâ), P(S)S (âdithioateâ), â(O)NR\n2 \n(âamidateâ), P(O)R, P(O)ORâ², CO or CH\n2 \n(âformacetalâ), in which each R or Râ² is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl (1-20 C) optionally containing an ether (âOâ) linkage, aryl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein, including RNA and DNA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âvariable regionâ of an antibody refers to the variable region of the antibody light chain or the variable region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combination. The variable regions of the heavy and light chain each consist of four framework regions (FR) connected by three complementarity determining regions (CDRs) also known as hypervariable regions. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and, with the CDRs from the other chain, contribute to the formation of the antigen-binding site of antibodies. There are at least two techniques for determining CDRs: (1) an approach based on cross-species sequence variability (i.e., Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, (5th ed., 1991, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Md.)); and (2) an approach based on crystallographic studies of antigen-antibody complexes (Chothia et al. (1989) Nature 342:877; Al-lazikani et al (1997) J. Molec. Biol. 273:927-948)). As used herein, a CDR may refer to CDRs defined by either approach or by a combination of both approaches.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âconstant regionâ of an antibody refers to the constant region of the antibody light chain or the constant region of the antibody heavy chain, either alone or in combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an âanti-CGRP antagonist antibodyâ (interchangeably termed âanti-CGRP antibodyâ) refers to an antibody which is able to bind to CGRP and inhibit CGRP biological activity and/or downstream pathway(s). An anti-CGRP antagonist antibody encompasses antibodies that block, antagonize, suppress or reduce (including significantly) CGRP biological activity. For purpose of the present invention, it will be explicitly understood that the term âanti-CGRP antagonist antibodyâ encompass all the previously identified terms, titles, and functional states and characteristics whereby the CGRP itself, a CGRP biological activity, or the consequences of the biological activity, are substantially nullified, decreased, or neutralized in any meaningful degree. Examples of anti-CGRP antagonist antibodies are provided herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âsubstantially pureâ refers to material which is at least 50% pure (i.e., free from contaminants), more preferably at least 90% pure, more preferably at least 95% pure, more preferably at least 98% pure, more preferably at least 99% pure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âhost cellâ includes an individual cell or cell culture that can be or has been a recipient for vector(s) for incorporation of polynucleotide inserts. Host cells include progeny of a single host cell, and the progeny may not necessarily be completely identical (in morphology or in genomic DNA complement) to the original parent cell due to natural, accidental, or deliberate mutation. A host cell includes cells transfected in vivo with a polynucleotide(s) of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âtreatmentâ is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired clinical results. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: improvement or alleviation of any aspect of inflammatory pain and/or symptom of inflammatory pain. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: including lessening severity, alleviation of pain and/or a symptom associated with inflammatory pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn âeffective amountâ of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results including clinical results such as alleviation or reduction in pain sensation. An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations. For purposes of this invention, an effective amount of drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition is an amount sufficient to treat, ameliorate, reduce the intensity of and/or prevent inflammatory pain or symptom associated with inflammatory pain. As is understood in the clinical context, an effective amount of a drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition may or may not be achieved in conjunction with another drug, compound, or pharmaceutical composition. Thus, an âeffective amountâ may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable result may be or is achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, âprepared forâ herein means the medicament is in the form of a dosage unit or the like suitably packaged and/or marked for use in peripheral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâReducing incidenceâ of inflammatory pain and/or a symptom associated with inflammatory pain means any of reducing severity (which can include reducing need for and/or amount of (e.g., exposure to) other drugs and/or therapies generally used for these conditions), duration, and/or frequency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâAmelioratingâ inflammatory pain and/or a symptom associated with inflammatory pain means a lessening or improvement of one or more symptoms of inflammatory pain and/or symptoms associated with inflammatory pain as compared to not administering an anti-CGRP antagonist antibody. âAmelioratingâ also includes shortening or reduction in duration of a symptom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâPalliatingâ inflammatory pain and/or a symptom associated with inflammatory pain means lessening the extent of one or more undesirable clinical manifestations of inflammatory pain in an individual or population of individuals treated with an anti-CGRP antagonist antibody in accordance with the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used therein, âdelayingâ the development of inflammatory pain means to defer, hinder, slow, retard, stabilize, and/or postpone progression of inflammatory pain and/or a symptom associated with inflammatory pain. This delay can be of varying lengths of time, depending on the history of the disease and/or individuals being treated. As is evident to one skilled in the art, a sufficient or significant delay can, in effect, encompass prevention, in that the individual does not develop inflammatory pain. A method that âdelaysâ development of the symptom is a method that reduces probability of developing the symptom in a given time frame and/or reduces extent of the symptoms in a given time frame, when compared to not using the method. Such comparisons are typically based on clinical studies, using a statistically significant number of subjects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âbiological sampleâ encompasses a variety of sample types obtained from an individual and can be used in a diagnostic or monitoring assay. The definition encompasses blood and other liquid samples of biological origin, solid tissue samples such as a biopsy specimen or tissue cultures or cells derived therefrom, and the progeny thereof. The definition also includes samples that have been manipulated in any way after their procurement, such as by treatment with reagents, solubilization, or enrichment for certain components, such as proteins or polynucleotides, or embedding in a semi-solid or solid matrix for sectioning purposes. The term âbiological sampleâ encompasses a clinical sample, and also includes cells in culture, cell supernatants, cell lysates, serum, plasma, biological fluid, and tissue samples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn âindividualâ or âsubjectâ is a vertebrate, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human.

An expression control sequence can be a promoter, such as a constitutive or an inducible promoter, or an enhancer. The expression control sequence is operably linked to the nucleic acid sequence to be transcribed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âpharmaceutically acceptable carrierâ includes any material which, when combined with an active ingredient, allows the ingredient to retain biological activity and is non-reactive with the subject's immune system. Examples include, but are not limited to, any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions such as oil/water emulsion, and various types of wetting agents. Preferred diluents for aerosol or parenteral administration are phosphate buffered saline or normal (0.9%) saline. Compositions comprising such carriers are formulated by well known conventional methods (see, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, A. Gennaro, ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1990; and Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 20th Ed. Mack Publishing, 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term âperipherally administeredâ as used herein refers to the route by which the a substance, medicament and/or anti-CGRP antagonist antibody is to be delivered, in particular it means not centrally, not spinally, not intrathecally, not delivered directly into the CNS.

The resulting joint pain leads to the development of sustained changes in weight bearing (assessed using an incapacitance meter) in the rat hind limbs and mechanical (tactile) allodynia (assessed using von Frey filaments), in the hind paw, lasting several weeks. Studies were carried out accordingly to a blind protocol, where the investigator was not aware of the identity of the compound/control or the treatment of the animal.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody G2 (an anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody) reversed weight bearing deficit of the OA hind limb at the highest dose tested, 10 mg/kg, IV. Its effect was comparable to celecoxib. Both compounds reversed the shift in weight bearing on the OA limb to normal value. No effect was seen with the lower dose. This effect lasted 10 days post administration when the plasma exposure of antibody G2 achieved an average value of 65.1Â±3 ug/ml (6.3Â±0.3 ug/ml, for the lower dose at 10 days post IV).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe negative control, null antibody, i.e. does not bind CGRP, (see \nFIG. 1\n), demonstrated an effect on weight bearing at the early time points. This effect was unexpected and cannot be explained, but was not sustained and not observed on the allodynia end points (\nFIG. 1\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepeat experiments under the same conditions using a buffer as negative control showed no effect on weight bearing for the negative control and reversed the shift in weight bearing on the OA limb to normal value for G1.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nBinding Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nA binding assay was performed to measure the IC\n50 \nof anti-CGRP antibody G2 and G1 in blocking human Î±-CGRP from binding to the CGRP1-receptor in SK-N-MC cells. Dose response curves were plotted and K\ni \nvalues were determined using the equation: K\ni\n=IC\n50\n/(1+([ligand]/K\nD\n); \nFIG. 2\n, where the equilibrium dissociation constant K\nD\n=0.37 nM for human Î±-CGRP to CGRP1-receptor as present in SK-N-MC cells. The reported IC\n50 \nvalue (in terms of IgG molecules) was converted to binding sites so that it could be compared with the affinities (K\nD\n) determined by Biacore using N-biotinylated human and rat Î±-CGRPs were captured on individual flow cells at low levels (typically 100 response units) to provide the reaction surfaces, while an unmodified flow cell served as a reference channel.

Binding affinity of G2 for rat Î± and Î² CGRP was equivalent (16 and 17 nM, respectively). Additionally G1 binding affinity is 40-fold more potent in human than rat for Î±-CGRP (Kd=0.042 and 1.22 nM, respectively) and equi-potent in human and rat for Î²-CGRP (Kd=0.155 and 0.152 nM, respectively). Antibody G1 also demonstrated good cross species selectivity and binds rat Î±-CGRP with the same affinity as antibody G2 (around 1.2 nM) Table 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nG1 binds human and cynomolgus monkey Î±- and Î²-CGRP with high affinity (K\nD\n=63 and 155 Î¼M, respectively). G1 displays species selectivity for human/cyno CGRP and binds Î±- and Î²-CGRP from other species e.g. rat with lower affinity (K\nD\n=2.57 nM and 152 Î¼M, respectively).\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nHalf Life of Anti-CGRP In-Vivo\n\n\n \n \n \nSerum measurements of anti-CGRP in rat, \nFIG. 3\n, indicate that the half life is of the order of 7 days. The antibody is peripherally restricted having a molecular weight of around 150,000, \nFIGS. 3\n \na\n, \n3\n \nb\n, i.e. it does not cross into the central nervous system or cross the blood brain barrier.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nSelectivity of Anti-CGRP Antibody\n\n\n \n \n \nWe determined the specificity of antibody G1 to human or rat CGRP by using the Biacore chip to âprobeâ the free concentration of a premixed complex of mAb+peptide. As expected when we pre-incubated antibody G1 with human or rat CGRP the response was fully blocked. In contrast pre-incubating G1, with an excess of amylin, calcitonin or adrenomedullin was comparable to the control response (G1 plus buffer) demonstrating that G1 did not form a complex with these peptides (\nFIG. 5\n).\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nIdentification of Antibody G1 Binding Epitope\n\n\n \n \n \nInteraction analysis was conducted at 25Â° C. on a Biacore 3000â¢ system equipped with streptavidin-coated (SA) sensor chips (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using a standard Biacore running buffer (HBS-P). First we confirmed that an N-biotinylated 25-37 human Î±-CGRP fragment bound with the same affinity to antibody G1, as full-length N-biotinylated human Î±-CGRP. Each amino acid between position 27-37 was then mutated individually to alanine and expressed the fold loss in affinity compared to the wild-type fragment. N-biotinylated fragments were captured on individual flow cells at low levels (typically 100 response units) to provide the reaction surfaces, while an unmodified flow cell served as a reference channel. Purified Fab fragments of antibody G1 were generated. Fab fragments were titrated over the chip using 1 Î¼M as the top concentration of a two-fold dilution series. Association and dissociation phases were monitored at 100 Î¼l/min for 1 minute and 5 minutes respectively. Surfaces were regenerated with a mixture of 35% ethanol+25 mM NaOH+0.5M NaCl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alanine scan results show that antibody G1 binds to the C-terminal region of human Î±-CGRP, particularly \nresidues\n 25 to 37, and shows specific binding to a region (i.e. loss of affinity is markedly increased when the specific binding region is mutated) which can be defined as the epitope and which lies within the last 5 C-terminal amino acids, i.e. from G33A to F37A. Most profound changes in affinity are caused through the G33A and F37A mutation (\nFIG. 4\n). C-terminal Phe is important for selectivity of antibody G1 for CGRP vs related peptides and gene family members (\nFIG. 6\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides an anti-CGRP antagonist antibody which specifically binds to an epitope defined by amino acids G33 to F37 of CGRP. The anti-CGRP antagonist antibody may specifically bind to the epitope defined by the amino acid sequence GSKAF, more specifically to the epitope of CGRP is defined as GXXXF where X can be any amino acid, the G33 and F37 being the most important residues of the epitope for defining high affinity binding of the anti-CGRP antagonist antibody.\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nAnalysis of Indicators of Physical or Psychological Dependence\n\n\n \n \n \nNeither antibody G1 nor antibody G2 demonstrate CNS penetration. Additionally long term observation of animals (rats) dosed with either antibody to levels used in the previous examples did not reveal adverse CNS events such as sedation or stimulation/euphoric behaviour in comparison to control animals. These observations indicate an absence of dependency risk for the antibodies and hence a significantly improved safety of the antibodies over current opiates used in current pain therapies.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nAnalysis of Indicators of Gastro-Intestinal Adverse Effects\n\n\n \n \n \nA 1 month in-vivo rat study with antibody G2 and 1 week comparative study with antibody G1 demonstrated that no adverse gastro intestinal effects were observed on behaviour, food intake, stool production or histopathology in comparison to control animals. These observations indicate an absence of gastrointestinal risk for the antibodies and hence a significantly improved safety of the antibodies over current NSAIDs used in current pain therapies.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nG1 and G2 as Anti-CGRP Antagonist Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nA known consequence of CGRP biological activity is the generation neurogenic flare when delivered in vivo. G1 and G2 are demonstrated to be anti-CGRP antagonist antibodies in that they prevent the development of neurogenic flare in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing a neurogenic skin flare rat model the efficacy of G1 was tested for its ability to block CGRP effect in vivo. The saphenous nerve in the rat is electrically stimulated causing CGRP release from nerve endings and leading to vasodilation, the resulting changes in blood flow can be measured using laser Dopler methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChanges in blood flow parameters were expressed as the area under the curve (AUC, change in arbitrary Doppler flux units multiplied by time). CGRP receptor antagonist CGRP\n8-37 \n(400 nmol/kg, i.v.) was used as a positive control to validate the specificity of the model (data not shown). To determine the effect of G1 prior to dosing for each animal, the baseline blood flow response to stimulation was established with two saphenous nerve stimulations each 30 minutes apart. Rats were treated with G1 after the blood flow response of the second stimulation had returned to baseline levels (approximately 10 minutes post stimulation) and an additional four stimulations at 30 minute intervals were performed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults (\nFIG. 7\n) demonstrated that in vehicle treated animals no significant change in blood flow response was but rats treated with G1 showed a significant decrease in blood flow response starting at 90 and 120 minutes post dose for 10 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg, respectively. Similar activity was achieved using D2. Additionally in further neurogenic flare and vasodilatation model tests G1 showed marked effect at 7 days post IV dosing (predicted ED\n50\n=6 ug/ml in saphenous nerve stimulation model). The conclusions form the tests done is that G1 and G2 demonstrate anti-CGRP antagonist activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar CGRP function-blocking ability for the antibodies is also shown in the publication, Zeller J, et. al.

The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe current invention relates to the field of immunology. More specifically, the present invention provides compositions and methods for producing an immunological response in a subject against a self-antigen, e.g., TNFÎ±, or any of a myriad of other self-antigens, or producing or increasing an immunological response in a subject against a foreign (non-self) antigen, by administering an immunogen that corresponds to a target moiety (i.e., either the self-moiety or the foreign-moiety) into which one or more unnatural amino acids have been incorporated.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nA major challenge in modern medicine concerns the treatment of medical conditions that either do not elicit production of antibodies by a subject (e.g., due to the subject's immunological tolerance to self-antigens) or which do not elicit strong/robust antibody responses (e.g., certain bacterial/viral infections). Numerous medical conditions exist which fall into such categories. For example, conditions arising from or involving a subject's own self-proteins can involve moieties such as TNFÎ± (involved/implicated in Crohn's disease, endotoxic shock, cerebral malaria, etc.), IL 10 (involved in SLE), and the like. Furthermore, it can be difficult for a subject to produce a robust antibody response to a variety of viral and bacterial infections such as HIV, CMV, tuberculosis, and \nstaphylococcus. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nA number of different approaches have been put forth to address such immunological response problems. For example, some approaches have considered improved adjuvants/carriers, introduction of strong T cell epitopes into antigens, conjugation vaccines and combination vaccines. See, e.g., Baldridge, et al., \nVaccine Adjuvants: Immunological and Clinical Principles\n. C. J. Hackett, Ham, D. A. Jr., Eds. (Humana Press, Totowa, N.J., 2006), pp. 235-255; Makela, et al., \nExpert Rev Vaccines, \n1(3): 399-410 (2002); Dalum, et al., \nNat. Biotechnol. \n17:666 (1999); and Restifo, \nCurr Opin Immunol \n8:658 (1996). Other approaches have tried immunization with nonspecifically labeled antigens (i.e., diazonium derivatized antigens). See, Weigle, \nJ Exp Med \n121:289 (1965).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, there is a continuing need for better, more widely applicable methods and compositions to produce or enhance a subject's immunological response against specific self-proteins, e.g., TNFÎ±, and/or against specific proteins from various pathogens, e.g., bacterial, viral, fungal, and/or prion pathogens. The current invention provides these and other benefits, as will be apparent upon examination.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability to selectively induce a strong immune response against self-proteins, or to increase the immunogenicity of specific epitopes of foreign antigens, is significant in the production of vaccines for a number of disease states, including cancer, protein folding diseases, and infectious diseases (e.g., bacterial or viral infections). The current invention utilizes the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins to produce unnatural immunogens to be used in vaccinations or to produce antibodies to be used in passive immunization. In the invention, the immunogens to which the unnatural amino acids are added correspond to target moieties (e.g., disease related moieties) within the subject to be vaccinated/immunized or correspond to target moieties (e.g., disease related moieties) that are capable of being within the subject. In embodiments where the immunogen with the unnatural amino acid is administered to a subject, the presence of the unnatural amino acid elicits an immunological response against the immunogen which is cross reactive against the target (e.g., disease related) moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a first aspect, the invention provides methods of producing or enhancing an immunological response, e.g., a B-cell mediated response and/or a T-cell mediated response, in a subject against a target moiety, e.g., a polypeptide, a carbohydrate, or a combination of both, that is in the subject or that is capable of being within the subject. The methods include providing an unnatural immunogen that comprises one or more unnatural amino acids, and administering the unnatural immunogen to the subject. The subject (e.g., a human, a monkey, a mouse, a rat, a pig, a cow, a chicken, a cage bird, an aviary bird, a reptile, and/or an amphibian) produces one or more antibodies against the unnatural immunogen, which antibodies are cross-reactive against the target moiety (thus producing or enhancing the immunogenic response against the target).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe unnatural immunogen administered to the subject to produce or enhance an immunological response corresponds to at least one target moiety within the subject (or to at least one moiety that is capable of being within the subject). In some embodiments, the target moiety can comprise a first amino acid sequence, and the unnatural immunogen can comprise a second amino acid sequence that is the same as the target's sequence, except that one or more natural amino acids of the target moiety's sequence have been substituted with one or more unnatural amino acids in the immunogen's sequence. Alternatively or additionally, the target moiety can comprise a first amino acid sequence, and the unnatural immunogen can comprise a second amino acid sequence, that is the same as the target moiety's sequence except that the immunogen's sequence further comprises one or more additional unnatural amino acids. In various embodiments, the unnatural immunogen can comprise a substantially similar structure to the target moiety from which it is derived and/or it can comprise tertiary and/or quaternary structure that is substantially similar to the target moiety from which it is derived.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe one or more unnatural amino acids present in the unnatural immunogen can optionally be antibody accessible. The one or more cross-reactive antibodies produced in the methods of this aspect can optionally be specific for an epitope on the target moiety that comprises the same sequence as the corresponding epitope on the unnatural immunogen. However, the cross-reactive antibodies can optionally be specific for an epitope on the target moiety that comprises a different sequence as compared to the corresponding epitope on the unnatural immunogen, e.g., a different sequence that optionally comprises the one or more unnatural amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this aspect, an unnatural immunogen that is derived from a target moiety can be produced in a variety of ways. In preferred embodiments, the unnatural immunogen is produced in an orthogonal translation system. However, the unnatural immunogen can optionally be produced in in an in vivo translation system (e.g., via selective pressure incorporation); in an in vitro translation system (e.g., using tRNAs that have been chemically acylated with an unnatural amino acid); by a process other than post-translational modification; or by a process other than chemical modification of one of the 20 naturally occurring canonical amino acids present in the immunogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe unnatural amino acids that can be incorporated into an unnatural immunogen can optionally comprise any unnatural amino acid other than one of the 20 naturally occurring canonical amino acids. The unnatural amino acid that can be incorporated can also comprise any one other than one of the 20 cannonical amino acids wherein the unnatural amino acid comprises a structure of:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere R is any substituent other than a side chain used in any of the 20 canonical natural amino acids; wherein R\n1 \nis any substituent used in one of the 20 canonical natural amino acids; wherein R2 is any substituent such that R2-R1 together is other than a side chain of any of the 20 canonical natural amino acids; wherein Z is OH, NH\n2\n, SH, NHâRâ², or SâRâ²; wherein Râ² is any substituent other than H; and wherein X and Y are each S or O and where R is of the L configuration if Râ² is H). In some embodiments, the one or more unnatural amino acids that can be incorporated into an immunogen can optionally include one or more: p-nitrophenylalanine; an o-nitrophenylalanine; an m-nitrophenylalanine; a p-boronyl Phe; an o-boronyl Phe; an m-boronyl Phe; a p-amino Phe; an o-amino Phe; an m-amino Phe; a p-acyl Phe; an o-acyl Phe; an m-acyl Phe; a p-OMe Phe; an o-OMe Phe; an m-OMe Phe; a p-sulfo Phe; an o-sulfo Phe; an m-sulfo Phe; a 5-nitro His; a 3-nitro Tyr; a 2-nitro Tyr; a nitro substituted Leu; a nitro substituted His; a nitro substituted Ile; a nitro substituted Trp; a 2-nitro Trp; a 4-nitro Trp; a 5-nitro Trp; a 6-nitro Trp; a 7-nitro Trp; 3-aminotyrosine, 2-aminotyrosine, O-sulfotyrosine, 2-sulfooxyphenylalanine, 3-sulfooxyoxyphenylalanine or p-carboxyphenylalanine, o-carboxyphenyalanine, and m-carboxyphenylalanine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the target moiety against which an immunological response is produced or enhanced can be a non-self moiety, e.g., a moiety derived from a bacterium, a virus, a fungus, a \nMycoplasma\n, a protozoan, a helminth, or a prion. A non-self target moiety can optionally include one or more of: a bacterial antigen, a viral antigen, a fungal antigen, a mycoplasmal antigen, a protozoan antigen, a helminth antigen, a prion antigen, an HIV antigen, HIVgp120, HIV gp41, HIV gag, HIV pol, HIV env, HIV tat, HIV nef, HIV rev, a calicivirus capsid antigen, a hepatitis B core antigen, a hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis delta

produced or enhanced can optionally comprise a self-moiety of the subject. The self moiety can optionally comprise any of a variety of disease-related moieties, e.g., a self antigen related to an autoimmune disease, a tumor associated antigen, an Alzheimer's disease associated antigen, amyloid beta40, amyloid beta42, a breast cancer associated antigen, an ovarian cancer associated antigen, a prostate cancer associated antigen, MAGE, BAGE, RAGE, NY-ESO, a lineage-specific tumor associated antigen, a melanocyte-melanoma lineage antigen, MART-1/Melan-A, a tyrosinase or tyrosinase-related protein, tyrosinase-\nrelated protein\n 2, PSMA, PSA, mutated ras, rearranged bcr/ab1, Her2/neu, mutated or wild-type p53, cytochrome P450 1B1, an abnormally expressed intron sequence of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-V, CA19-9, p53, OCAA, HOXB7, Ca125, PSA, PSMA, STEAP, PCTA-1, Ca15-3, EGF, EGFR, HER-1, CXCR4, a G protein-coupled receptor (GCPR), or CA27-29.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments the target self-moiety is TNFÎ± and the unnatural immunogen is an unnatural TNFÎ±. For example, in embodiments in which the subject is a mouse, the target moiety can be mTNFÎ±, and the immunogen can be an unnatural mTNFÎ±, e.g., an unnatural mTNFÎ± that comprises pNO\n2\nPhe\n86\n-mTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n11\n-mTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n19\n-mTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n21\n-mTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n42\n-mTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n49\n-mTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n104\n-mTNFÎ±, or pNO\n2\nPhe\n113\n-mTNFÎ±.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilarly, in embodiments in which the subject is a human, the target self-moiety can be an hTNFÎ±, and the immunogen can be an unnatural hTNFÎ±, e.g., a pNO\n2\nPhe\n11\n-hTNFÎ±c, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n19\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n21\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n42\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n49\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n87\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n105\n-hTNFÎ±, and a pNO\n2\nPhe\n114\n-hTNFÎ±.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods of prophylactically or therapeutically treating a disease state in a subject, e.g., by producing a B-cell mediated response and/or a T-cell mediated response in the subject. In various embodiments, the disease state can be, but is not limited to, one or more of: an autoimmune disorder, a cancer, a bacterial infection, a viral infection, a fungal infection, a \nMycoplasma \ninfection, a prion infection, a protozoan infection, or a helminth infection. One set of methods of the aspect includes administering an unnatural immunogen that comprises one or more unnatural amino acids to a subject, e.g., a human, a monkey, a mouse, a rat, a pig, a cow, a chicken, a cage bird, an aviary bird, a reptile, or an amphibian. The unnatural immunogen thus stimulates production of antibodies within the subject that are cross-reactive against one or more target moieties, e.g., polypeptides and/or carbohydrates, in the subject, or against one or more target moieties capable of being within the subject, that are associated with the disease state. In a second set of methods, of this aspect, the invention comprises prophyllactically or therapeutically treating a disease state in a subject by producing an antibody against one or more target moieties (e.g., a disease related moiety that is associated with the disease state/condition). Producing such an antibody comprises creating an antibody against an unnatural immunogen comprising one or more unnatural amino acids, which antibody is cross-reactive against the target moiety. The antibody is then administered to the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe unnatural immunogen in the methods of this aspect typically corresponds to at least one target moiety within the subject (or to at least one target moiety that is capable of being within the subject). In various embodiments, the target moiety can comprise a first amino acid sequence, and the unnatural immunogen can comprise a second amino acid sequence that is the same as the target's sequence, except that one or more natural amino acids of the target's sequence have been substituted with one or more unnatural amino acids in the immunogen's. Alternatively or additionally, the target moiety can comprise a first amino acid sequence, and the unnatural immunogen can comprise a second amino acid sequence, where the immunogen's sequence is the same as the target's sequence except that the immunogen's sequence further comprises one or more additional unnatural amino acids. The unnatural immunogen can comprise a substantially similar structure to the target moiety from which it is derived and/or can comprise tertiary and/or quaternary structure that is substantially similar to the target moiety from which it is derived.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe one or more unnatural amino acids present in the unnatural immunogens of the methods of the aspect can optionally be antibody accessible. The one or more cross-reactive antibodies can optionally be specific for an epitope on the target moiety that comprises the same sequence as the corresponding epitope on the unnatural immunogen. However, the cross-reactive antibodies can optionally be specific for an epitope on the target moiety that comprises a different sequence as compared to the corresponding epitope on the unnatural immunogen, e.g., a different sequence that optionally comprises one or more unnatural amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments of this aspect, the immunogen that is administered to the subject or against which an antibody is produced can be produced by any of the methods described in the earlier aspects or elsewhere herein. The unnatural immunogen can optionally include any unnatural amino acid, e.g., any of the unnatural amino acids described in the earlier aspects or elsewhere herein. The target moiety can optionally comprise a non-self moiety, e.g., including any of the non-self moieties described in the earlier aspects or elsewhere herein, or a self-moiety, e.g., a disease-related self-moiety, such as those described in the earlier aspects or elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of this aspect, the target moiety is TNFÎ±, and the methods of prophylatically or therapeutically treating a disease state can optionally include treating any one or more of the following disease states: endotoxic shock, cerebral malaria, an autoimmune disorder, multiple organ failure, multiple sclerosis, cardiac dysfunction, atherosclerosis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, insulin resistance, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, cachexia, septic shock, AIDS, graft-versus-host disease, bactericidal granulomas, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments wherein the subject is a mouse, the target moiety can be an mTNFÎ±, and the immunogen can be an unnatural mTNFÎ±, e.g., an unnatural mTNFÎ± comprising a pNO\n2\nPhe\n86\n-mTNFÎ±: a pNO\n2\nPhe\n11\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n19\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n21\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n42\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n49\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n104\n-mTNFÎ±, and a pNO\n2\nPhe\n113\n-mTNFÎ±. In some embodiments wherein the subject is a human, the self-moiety can be an hTNFÎ±, and the immunogen can be an unnatural hTNFÎ±, e.g., a pNO\n2\nPhe\n11\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n19\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n21\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n42\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n49\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n87\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n105\n-hTNFÎ±, and a pNO\n2\nPhe\n114\n-hTNFÎ±.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention provides methods of producing a vaccine (as well as a vaccine produced thereby), such methods include identifying a target moiety, e.g., a polypeptide and/or carbohydrate, that does not comprise an unnatural amino acid, for antibody therapy, providing an unnatural immunogen that comprises one or more unnatural amino acids, and admixing the unnatural immunogen with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, carrier or excipient, thus producing the vaccine. The unnatural immunogen that is provided in these methods can be structurally similar to the target moiety such that when administered to a subject, e.g., as described in the earlier aspects or elsewhere herein, the subject will produce antibodies against the unnatural immunogen that are cross-reactive against the target moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe unnatural immunogen in the methods of this aspect corresponds to at least one target moiety, within the subject (or to at least one target moiety that is capable of being within the subject). In various embodiments, the target moiety can comprise a first amino acid sequence and the unnatural immunogen can comprise a second amino acid sequence that is the same as the target's sequence, except that one or more natural amino acids of the target's sequence have been substituted with one or more unnatural amino acids in the immunogen's sequence. Alternatively or additionally, the target moiety can comprise a first amino acid sequence and the unnatural immunogen can comprise a second amino acid sequence, where the immunogen's sequence is the same as the target's sequence except that the immunogen's sequence further comprises one or more additional unnatural amino acids. The unnatural immunogen can comprise a substantially similar structure to the target moiety from which it is derived and/or can comprise tertiary and/or quaternary structure that is substantially similar to the target moiety from which it is derived.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe unnatural amino acid(s) present in the unnatural immunogen can optionally be antibody accessible. The one or more cross-reactive antibodies can optionally be specific for an epitope on the target moiety that comprises the same sequence as the corresponding epitope on the unnatural immunogen. However, the cross-reactive antibodies can optionally be specific for an epitope on the target moiety that comprises a different sequence as compared to the corresponding epitope on the unnatural immunogen, e.g., a different sequence that optionally comprises one or more unnatural amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, the immunogen that is provided to produce a vaccine can itself be produced by any of the methods described in the aspects above or elsewhere herein. Also the unnatural immunogen can optionally include any of the unnatural amino acids described in the aspects above or elsewhere herein. The target moiety can optionally comprise a non-self moiety, e.g., including any the non-self antigens or moieties described in the aspects above or elsewhere herein, or a self-moiety, e.g., a disease-related self-moiety, such as any of those described in the aspects above or elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of this aspect, the target self-moiety can be TNFÎ±. For example, in embodiments in which the subject is a mouse, the target self-moiety can be an mTNFÎ±, and the immunogen can be an unnatural mTNFÎ±, e.g., an unnatural mTNFÎ± comprising a pNO\n2\nPhe\n86\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n11\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n19\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n21\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n42\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n49\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n104\n-mTNFÎ±, and a pNO\n2\nPhe\n113\n-mTNFÎ±. In embodiments wherein the subject is a human, the target self-moiety can be an hTNFÎ±, and the immunogen can be an unnatural hTNFÎ±, e.g., a pNO\n2\nPhe\n11\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n19\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n21\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n42\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n49\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n87\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n105\n-hTNFÎ±, and a pNO\n2\nPhe\n114\n-hTNFÎ±.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention also provides methods of producing an unnatural TNFÎ± comprising pNO\n2\nPhe\n86\n-TNFÎ± in a cell. The methods include growing a cell in an appropriate medium. In such embodiments, the cell can comprise a nucleic acid that encodes a TNFÎ± and which comprises at least one selector codon at \namino acid position\n 86. The cell can also comprise an orthogonal-tRNA (O-tRNA) that recognizes the selector codon and an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (OâRS) that preferentially animoacylates the O-tRNA with the pNO\n2\nPhe. The methods also include providing a pNO\n2\nPhe, which permits the (OâRS) that preferentially aminoacylate the O-tRNA with the pNO\n2\nPhe and permits the orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to incorporate the pNO\n2\nPhe into \namino acid position\n 86 in response to the selector codon, thus producing the unnatural TNFÎ±. Other embodiments herein include methods of producing any other unnatural immunogen with any desired unnatural amino acid at any desired location in the immunogen through similar methods with appropriate modification (e.g., a nucleic acid for the desired immunogen, the appropriate selector codon at the desired locations, the presence of the desired unnatural amino acids, and the appropriate corresponding orthogonal machinery ORS, OtRNA, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides unnatural TNFÎ±s. Unnatural mTNFÎ±s provided by the invention include pNO\n2\nPhe\n86\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n11\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n19\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n21\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n42\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n49\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n104\n-mTNFÎ±, and a pNO\n2\nPhe\n113\n-mTNFÎ±. Unnatural hTNFÎ±s provided by the invention include a pNO\n2\nPhe\n11\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n19\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n21\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n42\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n49\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n87\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n105\n-hTNFÎ±, and a pNO\n2\nPhe\n114\n-hTNFÎ±. Compositions comprising these unnatural TNFÎ±s are also provided herein\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides antibodies against the unnatural TNFÎ±'s described above and compositions comprising these antibodies. The invention also provides antibodies that are cross-reactive against a natural TNFÎ± that does not comprise any unnatural amino acids and a TNFÎ± comprising one or more unnatural amino acid as well as compositions that include these antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also provides an unnatural mRBP4 comprising a pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4 and compositions that include such unnatural mRBP4. In addition, the invention provides antibodies against this unnatural mRBP4 that are cross-reactive against an RBP4, which does not comprise an unnatural amino acid, and compositions that include these antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the various aspects herein, the one or more unnatural amino acids that are incorporated into the unnatural immunogen are done so during synthesis of the immunogen. In some embodiments, the one or more unnatural amino acids are incorporated into the unnatural immunogen through a process other than post-translational modification or post-synthesis chemical modification. Thus, in various embodiments, the one or more unnatural amino acids are incorporated into the unnatural immunogen through one or more of: orthogonal translation; in vitro translation; native chemical ligation; expressed protein ligation; or solid-phase synthesis. In the various embodiments herein, the unnatural immunogen comprises one or more of the 20 naturally occurring canonical amino acids that has been glycosylated, nitroaryl modified, nitrated, aklylated, acetylated, oxidized, sulfated, or phosphorylated (e.g., glycosylated, nitroaryl modified, nitrated, alkylated, acetylated, oxidized, sulfated, or phosphorylated by a process other than post-translational modification or by a process other than chemical modification).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the invention provides a kit or an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the methods and compositions described herein. Such kits can optionally comprise one or more containers, labels, and instructions, as well components for construction of antibodies and/or unnatural immunogens and/or actual antibodies and/or unnatural immunogens (e.g., unnatural TNFÎ±s). The kits can also optionally comprise one or more antibody (e.g., an antibody against an unnatural immunogen, which antibody is cross-reactive against a natural target moiety within a subject) and/or one or more unnatural immunogen as well as optionally other components (e.g., various antibiotics, various antifungal agents, etc.). Such unnatural immunogens can include, but are not limited to, any one or more of the unnatural TNFÎ±s provided by the invention or any other unnatural immunogen described herein. The kits can optionally include tubes or other containers (e.g., of glass, plastic, nylon, cotton, polyester, metal, etc.) to store the components or in which to mix/prepare the components as well as one or more devices with which to administer such to a subject (e.g., a human in need of treatment, etc.). In some embodiments, the device with which to administer the components to the subject comprises the container in which the components are stored and/or mixed/prepared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kits can also optionally include additional components in addition to the antibody/unnatural immunogen components of the invention, e.g., buffers, diluents, filters, dressings, bandages, applicators, gauze, barriers, semi-permeable barriers, tongue depressors, needles, and syringes, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the kits comprise instructions (e.g., typically written instructions) relating to the use of the kit to treat a subject for one or more medical condition/disease state). In some embodiments, the kits comprise a URL address or phone number or the like for users to contact for instructions or further instructions. The kits can be unit doses, bulk packages (e.g., multi-dose packages), or sub-unit doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be apparent to those of skill in the art that the methods and compositions of the invention can be used alone or in combination with one another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese and other features of the invention will become more fully apparent when the following detailed description is read in conjunction with the accompanying figures and claims.\n\n\n \nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n \n \n \nBefore describing the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular devices or biological systems, which can, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms âa,â âan,â and âtheâ include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to âa surfaceâ includes âa combination of two or more surfacesâ; reference to âbacteriaâ includes âmixtures of bacteria,â and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice for testing of the present invention, the preferred materials and methods are described herein. In describing and claiming the present invention, the following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions set out below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody: As used herein, an âantibodyâ refers to a protein comprising one or more polypeptides substantially or partially encoded by immunoglobulin genes or fragments of immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively. A typical immunoglobulin, e.g., antibody, structural unit comprises a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one âlightâ (about 25 kD) and one âheavyâ chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms variable light chain (VL) and variable heavy chain (V\nH\n) refer to these light and heavy chains, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies can exist as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of well-characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases. Thus, for example, pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(abâ²)\n2\n, a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to V\nH\n-\nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 by a disulfide bond. The F(abâ²)\n2 \nmay be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region thereby converting the F(abâ²)\n2\ndimer into an Fabâ² monomer. The Fabâ² monomer is essentially an Fab with part of the hinge region (see, \nFundamental Immunology\n, W. E. Paul, ed., Raven Press, N.Y. (1999), for a more detailed description of other antibody fragments). While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that such Fabâ² fragments, etc. may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by utilizing recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term antibody, as used herein also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies. Antibodies include single chain antibodies, including single chain Fv (sFv or scFv) antibodies in which a variable heavy and a variable light chain are joined together (directly or through a peptide linker) to form a continuous polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn antibody that âcross-reactsâ with two or more different moieties is capable of binding to each of the different moieties, e.g. as determined by ELISA, FACS or other methods known to those of skill in the art. For example, an antibody that binds with an unnatural TNFÎ±, e.g., any one of the unnatural TNFÎ±s described herein, such as pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, and that also binds with native (or natural) TNFÎ± (which does not comprise any unnatural amino acids), thus cross-reacts with the two moieties. In particular embodiments herein, an antibody against an unnatural protein cross-reacts with the natural version of the same protein (i.e., the same protein, but which does not comprise an unnatural amino acid). In various embodiments, an antibody that binds to an unnatural molecule, cross-reacts to the natural version of the same molecule at about 1-50% or 50-100% or more of the binding ability of the antibody for the unnatural molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen: The term âantigenâ is used herein to refer to a molecule or substance that induces an antibody response in a subject immunized therewith. The antigen may be a protein, peptide, carbohydrate, nucleic acid, lipid, hapten or other naturally occurring or synthetic compound (or combination thereof). The antigen can be, e.g., an innate (self) antigen, or can be derived from, e.g., a bacterium, a virus, a parasite, a fungus, etc. The term also intends any of the various tumor antigens, autoimmune disease related antigens, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCognate: The term âcognateâ refers to components that function together, or have some aspect of specificity for each other, e.g., an orthogonal tRNA (O-tRNA) and an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (OâRS), in which the OâRS specifically aminoacylates the O-tRNA with an unnatural amino acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDerived from: As used herein, the term âderived fromâ refers to a component that is isolated from or made using a specified molecule or organism, or sequence information from the specified molecule or organism. For example, a polypeptide that is derived from a second polypeptide can include an amino acid sequence that is identical or substantially similar to the amino acid sequence of the second polypeptide. In the case of polypeptides, the derived species can be obtained by, for example, naturally occurring mutagenesis, artificial directed mutagenesis or artificial random mutagenesis. The mutagenesis used to derive polypeptides can be intentionally directed or intentionally random, or a mixture of both. The mutagenesis of a polypeptide to create a different polypeptide derived from the first can be a random event, e.g., caused by polymerase infidelity, and the identification of the derived polypeptide can be made by appropriate screening methods, e.g., as discussed in references cited herein. Mutagenesis of a polypeptide typically entails manipulation of the polynucleotide that encodes the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTarget moiety or target molecule: A âtarget moiety,â a âtarget molecule,â a âtarget protein moiety,â a âtarget antigenâ and the like refer to a moiety, e.g., a protein, peptide, carbohydrate, lipid, nucleic acid, or combination of any of such, against which it is desirable to create/enhance an immunological response through use of the current invention. Thus, a target moiety can be an innate (self) or an exogenous (foreign) molecule. It will be appreciated that recitation of specific examples herein, e.g., TNFÎ±, should not be taken as limiting and that the target moiety (and thus an unnatural immunogen that corresponds to it) can be any molecule to which an immunological response is desired. Thus, a target moiety is one upon which the unnatural immunogen is modeled or designed, from which it is derived, to which it corresponds, etc. As explained further below, an unnatural immunogen comprises the same, or nearly the same, sequence as a target moiety except that the unnatural immunogen comprises one or more unnatural amino acids (and is created through, e.g., orthogonal translation systems, in vitro translation systems, etc. and/or through methods other than post-translational or chemical modification). In many embodiments, a target moiety is a disease related moiety, i.e., a moiety that arises or is present in a subject due to a disease state (e.g., cancer, autoimmune disorders, or from/caused by an infectious organism, such as a bacterium, virus, prion, mycoplasm, fungus, parasite, etc.). A natural target moiety (i.e., not comprising an unnatural amino acid) can be antigenic/and or immunogenic or not (e.g., it can be weakly immunogenic). In particular embodiments, an unnatural version of a target moiety (e.g., a moiety that is similar to the natural target moiety but which comprises one or more unnatural amino acids as replacement of corresponding natural amino acids in the target moiety and/or as additions to the amino acids of the target moiety) is antigenic and/or immunogenic (whether or not the natural target moiety is antigenic and/or immunogenic). Such unnatural target moieties are described as âunnatural target moieties,â âunnatural antigens,â or, more often, as âunnatural immunogens,â or the like herein. Thus, an âunnaturalâ immunogen, moiety, molecule, etc., herein, is one that comprises one or more unnatural amino acid. In some such unnatural moieties, the unnatural amino acid is optionally either wholly or partially accessible to an antibody (e.g., an antibody can bind to the region of the moiety comprising the unnatural amino acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffective amount: The term âeffective amountâ means a dosage or amount sufficient to produce a desired result. The desired result may comprise an objective or subjective improvement in the recipient of the dosage or amount (e.g., production of cross-reactive antibodies, long-term survival, decrease in number and/or size of tumors, effective prevention or partial prevention of a disease state, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEncode: As used herein, the term âencodeâ refers to any process whereby the information in a polymeric macromolecule or sequence string is used to direct the production of a second molecule or sequence string that is different from the first molecule or sequence string. The term is used broadly herein, and can have a variety of applications. In some aspects, the term âencodeâ describes the process of semi-conservative DNA replication, where one strand of a double-stranded DNA molecule is used as a template to encode a newly synthesized complementary sister strand by a DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. In another aspect, the term âencodeâ refers to any process whereby the information in one molecule is used to direct the production of a second molecule that has a different chemical nature from the first molecule. For example, a DNA molecule can encode an RNA molecule, e.g., by the process of transcription incorporating a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme. Also, an RNA molecule can encode a polypeptide, as in the process of translation. When used to describe the process of translation, the term âencodeâ also extends to the triplet codon that encodes an amino acid. In some aspects, an RNA molecule can encode a DNA molecule, e.g., by the process of reverse transcription incorporating an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. In another aspect, a DNA molecule can encode a polypeptide, where it is understood that âencodeâ as used in that case incorporates both the processes of transcription and translation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunogen: As used herein, an âimmunogenâ refers to a moiety, which optionally can be administered to a subject, which induces an immunological response. An âunnatural immunogenâ is a moiety, e.g., a target moiety such as a disease-related moiety, comprising one or more unnatural amino acids and which can be administered to a subject to induce an immunological response. See also above. For unnatural immunogens of the invention, serum antibodies, B-cells, and/or T-cells produced by such immunological response are advantageously cross-reactive against the corresponding natural target moiety (e.g., from which the immunogen is derived, from which it is modeled/designed, to which it corresponds, etc.) that comprises no unnatural amino acids, thus producing an immunological response against the natural target moiety. Thus, in some embodiments, an unnatural immunogen can induce an immunological response that is protective against a disease (or that can be used to treat a disease state) associated with the natural target moiety from which the unnatural immunogen is derived (or to which the unnatural immunogen corresponds, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunogenic composition: An âimmunogenic compositionâ is a composition that comprises one or more molecule where administration of the composition to a subject results in the development in the subject of a humoral and/or a cellular immune response to the moiety. The immunogenic composition can be introduced directly into a recipient subject, such as by injection, inhalation, oral, intranasal and mucosal (e.g., intra-rectally or intra-vaginally) administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunological response or immune response: An âimmunological responseâ or âimmune responseâ to a moiety or composition thereof is the development in a subject of a cellular and/or antibody-mediated immune response to the moiety. Usually, an immunological response includes but is not limited to one or more of the following effects: the production of antibodies (preferably), B cells, helper T cells, suppressor T cells, and/or cytotoxic T cells and/or Î³Î´ T cells, directed specifically to one or more antigen of the moiety. In various embodiments, the subject will display either a therapeutic or prophylactic immunological response such that resistance to a new challenge with the moiety will be enhanced and/or the clinical severity of the disease state caused by/associated with the moiety is reduced.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn response to: As used herein in regard to orthogonal production of unnatural molecules, the term âin response toâ refers to the process in which an O-tRNA recognizes a selector codon and mediates the incorporation of the unnatural amino acid, which is coupled to the tRNA, into the growing polypeptide chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrthogonal: As used herein, the term âorthogonalâ refers to a molecule, e.g., an orthogonal tRNA (O-tRNA) and/or an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (OâRS)) that functions with endogenous components of a cell with reduced efficiency as compared to a corresponding molecule that is endogenous to the cell or translation system, or that fails to function with endogenous components of the cell. In the context of tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, orthogonal refers to an inability or reduced efficiency, e.g., less than 20% efficiency, less than 10% efficiency, less than 5% efficiency, or less than 1% efficiency, of an orthogonal tRNA to function with an endogenous tRNA synthetase compared to an endogenous tRNA to function with the endogenous tRNA synthetase, or of an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to function with an endogenous tRNA compared to an endogenous tRNA synthetase to function with the endogenous tRNA. The orthogonal molecule lacks a functionally normal endogenous complementary molecule in the cell. For example, an orthogonal tRNA in a cell is aminoacylated by any endogenous RS of the cell with reduced or even zero efficiency, when compared to aminoacylation of an endogenous tRNA by the endogenous RS. In another example, an orthogonal RS aminoacylates any endogenous tRNA a cell of interest with reduced or even zero efficiency, as compared to aminoacylation of the endogenous tRNA by an endogenous RS. A second orthogonal molecule can be introduced into the cell that functions with the first orthogonal molecule. For example, an orthogonal tRNA/RS pair includes introduced complementary components that function together in the cell with an efficiency, e.g., 45% efficiency, 50% efficiency, 60% efficiency, 70% efficiency, 75% efficiency, 80% efficiency, 90% efficiency, 95% efficiency, or 99% or more efficiency, as compared to that of a control, e.g., a corresponding tRNA/RS endogenous pair, or an active orthogonal pair.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase: As used herein, an orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (OâRS) is an enzyme that preferentially aminoacylates the O-tRNA with an amino acid in a translation system of interest. The amino acid that the OâRS loads onto the O-tRNA can be any amino acid, whether natural, unnatural or artificial, and is not limited herein. The synthetase is optionally the same as, or homologous to, a naturally occurring tyrosyl amino acid synthetase, or the same as, or homologous to, a synthetase designated as an OâRS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrthogonal tRNA: As used herein, an orthogonal tRNA (O-tRNA) is a tRNA that is orthogonal to a translation system of interest, where the tRNA is, e.g., (1) identical or substantially similar to a naturally occurring tRNA, (2) derived from a naturally occurring tRNA by natural or artificial mutagenesis, (3) derived by any process that takes a sequence of a wild-type or mutant tRNA sequence of (1) or (2) into account, (4) homologous to a wild-type or mutant tRNA; (5) homologous to any example tRNA that is designated as a substrate for an orthogonal tRNA synthetase or (6) a conservative variant of any example tRNA that is designated as a substrate for an orthogonal tRNA synthetase. The O-tRNA can exist charged with an amino acid, or in an uncharged state. It is also to be understood that an âO-tRNAâ optionally is charged (aminoacylated) by a cognate synthetase with an unnatural amino acid. Indeed, it will be appreciated that an O-tRNA is advantageously used to insert essentially any unnatural amino acid into a growing polypeptide, during translation, in response to a selector codon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical composition: The term âpharmaceutical compositionâ herein refers to a composition suitable for pharmaceutical use in, or administration to, a subject, including an animal or human. A pharmaceutical composition generally comprises an effective amount of an active agent, e.g., an antibody and/or unnatural immunogen of the invention, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, a buffer, adjuvant, or the like. A âpharmaceutically acceptableâ or âpharmacologically acceptableâ material is one that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the material may be administered to an individual in a formulation or composition without causing any (or causing few) undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the components of the composition in which it is contained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolypeptide: A polypeptide is any oligomer of amino acid residues (natural or unnatural, or a combination thereof), of any length, typically but not exclusively joined by covalent peptide bonds. A polypeptide can be from any source, e.g., a naturally occurring polypeptide, a polypeptide produced by recombinant molecular genetic techniques, a polypeptide from a cell or translation system, or a polypeptide produced by cell-free synthetic means. A polypeptide is characterized by its amino acid sequence, e.g., the primary structure of its component amino acid residues. As used herein, the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide is not limited to full-length sequences, but can be partial or complete sequences. Furthermore, it is not intended that a polypeptide be limited by possessing or not possessing any particular biological activity. As used herein, the term âproteinâ is synonymous with polypeptide. The term âpeptideâ refers to a small polypeptide, for example but not limited to, from 2-25 amino acids in length.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferentially aminoacylates: As used herein in reference to orthogonal translation systems, an OâRS âpreferentially aminoacylatesâ a cognate O-tRNA when the OâRS charges the O-tRNA with an amino acid more efficiently than it charges any endogenous tRNA in an expression system. That is, when the O-tRNA and any given endogenous tRNA are present in a translation system in approximately equal molar ratios, the OâRS will charge the O-tRNA more frequently than it will charge the endogenous tRNA. Preferably, the relative ratio of O-tRNA charged by the OâRS to endogenous tRNA charged by the OâRS is high, preferably resulting in the OâRS charging the O-tRNA exclusively, or nearly exclusively, when the O-tRNA and endogenous tRNA are present in equal molar concentrations in the translation system. The relative ratio between O-tRNA and endogenous tRNA that is charged by the OâRS, when the O-tRNA and OâRS are present at equal molar concentrations, is greater than 1:1, preferably at least about 2:1, more preferably 5:1, still more preferably 10:1, yet more preferably 20:1, still more preferably 50:1, yet more preferably 75:1, still more preferably 95:1, 98:1, 99:1, 100:1, 500:1, 1,000:1, 5,000:1 or higher.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe OâRS âpreferentially aminoacylates an O-tRNA with an unnatural amino acidâ when (a) the OâRS preferentially aminoacylates the O-tRNA compared to an endogenous tRNA, and (b) where that aminoacylation is specific for the unnatural amino acid, as compared to aminoacylation of the O-tRNA by the OâRS with any natural amino acid. That is, when the unnatural and natural amino acids are present in equal molar amounts in a translation system comprising the OâRS and O-tRNA, the OâRS will load the O-tRNA with the unnatural amino acid more frequently than with the natural amino acid. Preferably, the relative ratio of O-tRNA charged with the unnatural amino acid to O-tRNA charged with the natural amino acid is high. More preferably, OâRS charges the O-tRNA exclusively, or nearly exclusively, with the unnatural amino acid. The relative ratio between charging of the O-tRNA with the unnatural amino acid and charging of the O-tRNA with the natural amino acid, when both the natural and unnatural amino acids are present in the translation system in equal molar concentrations, is greater than 1:1, preferably at least about 2:1, more preferably 5:1, still more preferably 10:1, yet more preferably 20:1, still more preferably 50:1, yet more preferably 75:1, still more preferably 95:1, 98:1, 99:1, 100:1, 500:1, 1,000:1, 5,000:1 or higher.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProphylactic treatment: A âprophylactic treatmentâ is a treatment administered to a subject who does not display signs or symptoms of a disease, pathology, or medical disorder, or displays only early signs or symptoms of a disease, pathology, or disorder, such that treatment is administered for the purpose of diminishing, preventing, or decreasing the risk of developing the disease, pathology, or medical disorder. A prophylactic treatment functions as a preventative treatment against a disease or disorder. A âprophylactic activityâ is an activity of an agent, such an unnatural immunogen and/or antibody, or composition thereof, that, when administered to a subject who does not display signs or symptoms of a pathology, disease, or disorder (or who displays only early signs or symptoms of such) diminishes, prevents, or decreases the risk of the subject developing the pathology, disease, or disorder.

The current invention utilizes the direct incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins to produce unnatural immunogens that can be beneficially used in vaccinations or to produce antibodies for passive immunization. In the invention, the proteins into which the unnatural amino acids are incorporated correspond to target moieties (e.g., disease-related moieties) within the subject to be vaccinated/immunized (or correspond to target moieties that are capable of being within the subject). In embodiments where the immunogen with the unnatural amino acid is administered to a subject, the presence of the unnatural amino acid elicits an immunological response against the unnatural immunogen. Antibodies produced by such response are beneficially cross-reactive against the natural target moiety from which the immunogen is derived (or corresponds to), thus producing an immunological response against the target moiety. The methods of the invention are particularly useful in generating an immunological response against non-immunogenic or weakly immunogenic target moieties that are in (or capable of being in) the subject. The invention also includes embodiments in which a subject is administered antibodies produced against the unnatural immunogen (i.e., the immunogen having the unnatural amino acid) that are cross-reactive against the corresponding natural target moiety (again, e.g., disease-related moiety) within (or capable of being within) the subject. In either embodiment, the invention results in increased immunological protection against challenge by the target moiety, whether such is an innate self-protein, e.g., TNFÎ±, or a foreign molecule, e.g., a bacterial antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one example, the invention described herein also provides compositions and methods that can be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of pathologies associated with the activity of TNFÎ±. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±) is a pleiotropic cytokine that is implicated in exacerbating and/or causing many chronic inflammatory diseases, e.g., septic shock, rheumatoid arthritis, cerebral malaria, and Crohn's disease. The invention provides methods of producing an unnatural TNFÎ±, e.g., a TNFÎ± comprising one or more immunogenic, antibody-accessible unnatural amino acid. The invention also provides methods for using an unnatural TNFÎ± to break immunological tolerance for TNFÎ±, e.g., to induce the immune system to produce or enhance an immune response against the body's endogenous TNFÎ±. Neutralizing endogenous TNFÎ±, e.g., with antibodies elicited against an unnatural TNFÎ±, which antibodies cross react with epitopes on TNFÎ±, can alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of such diseases as, e.g., endotoxic shock, cerebral malaria, autoimmune disorders, multiple organ failure, multiple sclerosis, cardiac dysfunction, atherosclerosis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, insulin resistance, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, cachexia, septic shock, AIDS, graft-versus-host disease, bactericidal granulomas, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and/or silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments comprising TNFÎ±, the unnatural amino acid p-nitrophenylalanine, which comprises a highly immunogenic nitrophenyl moiety, replaces a tyrosine residue at \nposition\n 86 of the mTNFÎ± protein to produce an unnatural TNFÎ± derivative with useful therapeutic and/or prophylactic properties. Additional unnatural TNFÎ± derivatives that can find use in therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatments in a subject (e.g., a mouse) include a pNO\n2\nPhe\n11\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n19\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n21\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n42\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n49\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n104\n-mTNFÎ±, or a pNO\n2\nPhe\n113\n-mTNFÎ±. Additional unnatural TNFÎ± derivatives that can find use in therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatments in a subject (e.g., a human) include a pNO\n2\nPhe\n11\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n19\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n21\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n42\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n49\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n87\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n105\n-hTNFÎ±, or a pNO\n2\nPhe\n114\n-hTNFÎ±.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, the invention described herein also provides compositions and methods that can be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of pathologies associated with the activity of retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4). RBP4 has been implicated in presence/development of, e.g., Matthew Wood Syndrome, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and Stargardt's disease, etc.\n\n\n \n \nBreaking Immunological Tolerance with Unnatural Immunogens\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA major challenge in modern medical treatment has been the development of robust methods to either increase the immunogenicity of specific weakly-immunogenic foreign antigens, e.g., to elicit neutralizing antibodies, or to selectively overcome tolerance to self-antigens. Important to the process of immunological discrimination between self and non-self is the concept of self-tolerance in which a mammal's immune system is âtolerizedâ to self-proteins in order to avoid autoimmune disease, primarily due to the absence or inactivation of self-reactive B- or T-cells. Several strategies have been pursued to address these challenges, including the development of improved adjuvants and carriers, the introduction of strong T cell epitopes into antigens, lipid conjugation, and combination vaccines, etc. See, e.g., Dalum et al., \nNat Biotechnol \n17:666 (1999); Makela, et al., \nExpert Rev Vaccines \n1:399 (2002); Restifo, \nCurr Opin Immunol \n8:658 (1996); and Baldridge, et al., \nVaccine Adjuvants: Immunological and Clinical Principles\n. C. J. Hackett, Harn, D. A. Jr., Eds. (Humana Press, Totowa, N.J., 2006), pp. 235-255; and Zuany-Amorim, et al. (2004) âInduction of TNF-alpha autoantibody production by AutoVac TNF106: a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of allergic diseasesâ \nInt Arch Allergy Immunol \n133:154-163. It has been demonstrated that immunization of rabbits with a rabbit thyroglobulin that has been extensively nonspecifically labeled with a diazonium derivative induces cross-reactive antibodies to native thyroglobulin. See, Weigle, \nJ Exp Med \n121:289 (1965). However, such an approach is not easily modified/controlled to address other antigens, etc. Also, the nonspecific derivatization of autologous cancer cells with dinitrophenyl groups has been exploited as a vaccine in melanoma patients (Berd, D. (2004) âM-Vax: an autologous, hapten-modified vaccine for human cancerâ \nExpert Rev Vaccines \n3:521-527). Further references are found thoughout (e.g., the Examples below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast to prior attempts, the current invention permits the substitution (at particular desired locations) of one or more natural amino acids in a target epitope of a target moiety (e.g., a disease-related moiety) with one or more unnatural amino acids (UAA) in order to create an unnatural immunogen. Alternately or additionally, one or more specific unnatural amino acid residues can be added to a target epitope in a target moiety to create an unnatural immunogen. Such unnatural amino acid substitutions and/or additions can create one or more immunogenic, optionally structurally conservative epitopes in the unnatural immunogen that are capable of eliciting a strong immune response, e.g., a T-cell response and/or B-cell response, to the corresponding region in the wild-type (wt) natural target protein (e.g., in a subject). Also, as explained further below, cross-reactive antibodies produced in response to an unnatural immunogen can also be specific for regions of the corresponding natural target molecule which do not include an unnatural amino acid. See below. The current invention can optionally be superior to previous attempts at breaking tolerance using monoclonal antibodies or chimeric drugs, which are problematic due to the frequent injections and large quantities or protein required. As indicated herein, in some embodiments, the serum durability of antibodies produced in a subject through use of unnatural immogens of the invention can allow a low frequency of booster immunizations to be required during treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB cells recognize free (soluble) antigen (e.g., an unnatural immunogen) in the blood or lymph via BCRs (B cell receptors) or membrane bound-immunoglobulins. Following the recognition of the antigen, a B cell will internalize it and display fragments of the antigen on its surface complexed with an MHC. Once activated, B cells can develop into memory B cells, which produce and secrete antibodies that can assist insuch actions as neutralizing a diease-associated target moiety from which the antigen (the unnatural immunogen) was derived (corresponds to) and/or in the destruction of infectious target agents on which the epitope is antibody accessible.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nT cells, e.g., CD4\n+\n T cells, specific for an antigen (e.g., the unnatural immunogen), will bind to the MHC-complexed peptide fragments displayed by, e.g., B cells. The T cells can then proliferate and release cytokines that stimulate immune cell proliferation and differentiation. Some of these primed T cells develop into memory cells which confer immediate protection against, e.g., the target (e.g., disease-related) moiety from which the unnatural immunogen was derived, as well as the capacity to mount a more rapid and effective secondary immune response. This activity can be quantified in T lymphocyte proliferation assays (see Examples 1 and 2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOver fifty unnatural amino acids have been genetically encoded in either bacteria, yeast or mammalian cells in response to specific nonsense and frameshift codons. See, e.g., Wang, et al., \nScience \n292:498 (2001); Chin, et al., \nScience \n301:964 (2003); Liu, et al., \nNat Methods \n4:239 (2007); Anderson, et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n101:7566 (2004); and Wang, et al., \nAngew Chem Int Ed Eng\n144:34 (2004), as well as other references herein. These include metal-binding and posttranslationally modified amino acids, fluorescent and redox-active amino acids, and photo- and chemically-reactive amino acids. For example, the phenylalanine derivative p-nitrophenylalanine (pNO\n2\nPhe, \nFIG. 1A\n) has been incorporated into proteins in bacteria in response to the amber nonsense codon with high fidelity and good efficiency for use as a spectroscopic distance probe. See Tsao, et al., \nJ Am Chem Soc \n128:4572 (2006). It will be appreciated that while the examples and description herein may discuss use of pNO\n2\nPhe, that such should not be considered limiting and that the invention encompasses use of any unnatural amino acid (e.g., including, but not limited to, those listed herein and/or described in the references herein). Additional information on unnatural amino acids that can be used in various embodiments of the invention is given below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of Breaking Immunological Tolerance with Unnatural Immunogens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNitroaryl groups have historically been used as highly immunogenic haptens (see Keinan, Ed., \nCatalytic Antibodies \n(Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005), pages 1-28), likely due to the propensity of the electron deficient pi system to interact with the Tyr and Trp side chains common to antibody combining sites. Because of their close structural similarity, either PheâpNO\n2\nPhe or TyrâpNO\n2\nPhe mutations in a target moiety (e.g., disease-related moiety) of interest can produce an immunogen that generates a robust immune response that is cross-reactive with the native natural target moiety from which the immunogen is derived (corresponds to).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, as shown in the Examples, immunization of mice with, e.g., a Tyr\n86\nâpNO\n2\nPhe mutant of murine tumor necrosis factor-Î± (mTNFÎ±), generates a high titer antibody response to wild-type mTNFÎ± (wt mTNFÎ±), which efficiently protects mice against a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nmTNFÎ± was chosen as the target protein to illustrate aspects of the current invention because it is a well-characterized cytokine involved in the regulation of infectious, inflammatory and autoimmune phenomena (see Vassalli, \nAnnu Rev Immunol \n10:411 (1992)); and the biological properties of mTNFÎ±, including its expression, structure, function, and signaling mechanisms have been extensively studied. See, e.g., Vassalli, supra; Baeyens, et al., \nActa Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr \n55:772 (1999); Pennica, et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n82:6060 (1985); Pasparakis, et al., \nJ Exp Med \n184:1397 (1996); Baeyens, H. L. et al., \nActa Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr \n53:329 (1997); and Aggarwal, Vilcek, J., Ed., \nTumor necrosis factors: structure, function, and mechanism of action \n(Dekker, New York, 1992), pages 1-587. In addition, mTNFÎ± knockout mice are viable and show no apparent phenotypic abnormalities (see Pasparakis, supra), which suggests that the mice would survive a neutralizing immune response against TNF, thus allowing the vaccinated animals to be analyzed for anti-TNFÎ± antibody production and biological activity. Furthermore, anti-TNFÎ± antibodies (Knight, et al., \nMol Immunol \n30:1443 (1993); and Present, et al., \nN Engl J Med \n340:1398 (1999)) and soluble chimeric TNFÎ± receptors (Peppel, et al., \nJ Exp Med \n174:1483 (1991); and Williams, et al., \nImmunology \n84:433 (1995)) had been widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, a TNFÎ±-specific vaccine for clinical use would be desirable (Datum, supra; Spohn, et al., \nJ Immunol \n178:7450 (2007); Buanec, et al., \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n103:19442 (2006); Capini, et al., \nVaccine \n22:3144 (2004)). On the basis of the X-ray crystal structure of trimeric mTNFÎ± (Baeyens, et al., \nActa Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr \n55:772 (1999); and Baeyens, et al., \nActa Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr \n53:329 (1997)), a single Tyr\n86\nâpNO\n2\nPhe mutant mTNFÎ± (pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, see \nFIG. 1B\n) was selected as an immunogen for illustration of the invention. Tyr\n86 \nis highly conserved among different mammalian TNFs and it has been determined that mutations at this site have no effect on protein folding or on trimer formation. Mutations at Tyr\n86 \nalso lead to a significant loss in cytotoxicity, which is advantageous for vaccination purposes. See, e.g., Van Ostade, et al., \nProtein Eng \n7:5 (1994); Loetscher, et al., \nJ Biol Chem \n268:26350 (1993); and Zhang, et al., \nJ Biol Chem \n267:24069 (1992).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExample 2 provides further illustration of the broad applicability of the current invention by, e.g., characterizing the nature and durability of the polyclonal IgG antibody response against TNFÎ± and by showing the generation of an antibody response against wild-type \nretinol binding protein\n 4, mRBP4, (thus showing the use of the invention with a self-protein that is unrelated to immune function). Interestingly, Example 2 also shows that pNO\n2\nPhe-induced breakdown of self-tolerance generates an antibody response against multiple epitopes in WT mTNFÎ±, which epitopes do not necessarily include the region in the natural TNFÎ± corresponding to the region comprising the pNO\n2\nPhe residue in the unnatural immunogen TNFÎ±. Thus, immunization with an unnatural immunogen of the invention can advantageously result in immunoglobulin epitope spreading, whereby epitopes distinct from an inducing epitope become major targets of an ongoing immune response. See below. The broadening of immunity to epitopes throughout the disease-associated moiety from which the unnatural immunogen is derived is a phenomenon that is particularly sought after in vaccine design. Enhancing the immune system's ability to attack multiple targets on a disease-associated moiety can increase the efficiency and/or robustness of an immune response against the moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that the illustrations in the Examples below are not the only TNFÎ± or RPB4 embodiments of the invention. As will be apparent from the description herein, various embodiments can comprise one or more of ANY unnatural amino acid in the unnatural TNFÎ± and RPB4 moieties. Furthermore, the unnatural amino acids present in such unnatural immunogens can optionally be in any location within the immunogens. The unnatural amino acids that replace the corresponding natural amino acids in the natural TNFÎ± and RBP4 can be conservative amino acid replacements or can be non-conservative amino acid replacements. Also, the unnatural immunogenic TNFÎ± and RBP4 can be constructed in any of a number of methods. While many embodiments utilize orthogonal translation (see below) as the route of direct incorporation of the unnatural amino acids, other direct incorporation methods (e.g., in vitro translation systems, solid-phase synthesis, etc.) can also optionally be used. The embodiments herein typically do not use post-translational or chemical modification methods except in conjunction or in addition to direct incorporation methods such as orthogonal translation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods and Compositions to Strengthen/Enhance Immunogenic Responses\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs can be seen from the Examples and description herein, unnatural immunogens of the invention can produce a robust cross-reactive antibody response against a native target moiety(s) (e.g., a disease-related protein that does not comprise an unnatural amino acid) that is protective against a disease (or that can be used to treat a disease state) associated with the target moiety(s). Thus, the invention can break immunological self-tolerance by the site-specific incorporation of an unnatural amino acid into a specific epitope of a target moiety of interest, e.g., a surface exposed epitope or a T-cell epitope in a disease related moiety). For example, in the simplified scematic below, a target moiety (e.g., a disease related moiety) comprises \n \n \nepitopes\n \n \n 1, 2, and 3. The unnatural immunogen also comprises \n \n \nepitopes\n \n \n 1, 2, and 3, which are derived from or correspond to (e.g., have identical sequences as) \n \n \nepitopes\n \n \n 1, 2, and 3 of the moiety. However, \nepitope\n 2 of the unnatural immunogen includes an unnatural amino acid (indicated by the asterisk) which replaces the corresponding natural amino acid in the target moiety. The presence of the unnatural amino acid in the unnatural immunogen can lead to the production of cross-reactive antibodies that can recognize different epitopes of the target moiety (epitope spreading). For example, cross reactive antibodies can be generated against \nepitopes\n 1 and 3 (which do not correspond to the epitope in the unnatural immunogen that comprises the unnatural amino acid) as well as to epitope 2 (which does correspond to the epitope in the unnatural immunogen having the unnatural amino acid).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTarget moiety\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEpitope\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1\n\n\n \nEpitope\n 2\n\n\n \nEpitope\n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nUnnatural Immunogen\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEpitope\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1\n\n\n \nEpitope\n 2 *\n\n\n \nEpitope\n 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBreaking immunological self-tolerance by site-specific incorporation of an unnatural amino acid into a specific epitope of a target moiety of interest to thus create an unnatural immunogen is applicable to a large number of endogenous moieties (e.g., proteins), including those associated with protein folding diseases or cancer (e.g., an amyloid-beta (1-42) peptide or prostate specific antigen, respectively). In addition, this approach also allows generation of a strong antibody response against weakly immunogenic epitopes to result in neutralizing antibodies against foreign target moieties, e.g., foreign targets arising from viral, bacterial, fungal, prion, or parasitic infections.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that various embodiments herein utilize administration of an unnatural immunogen (i.e., a molecule that corresponds to a target moiety, but which comprises one or more unnatural amino acids) which, when inoculated into a subject, will lead to production of antibodies, B cells, and/or T-cells against the unnatural immunogen that are cross-reactive against the target moiety, e.g., a disease-related moiety that does not comprise unnatural amino acids and which moiety is within the subject or capable of being within the subject. In yet other embodiments, an unnatural immunogen can be used to produce antibodies that cross-react with the natural target moiety, which antibodies are in turn administered as prophylactic/therapeutic treatments to a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, in some embodiments herein, the invention comprises methods of producing an immunogenic (or immunological) response against a target moiety in a subject (e.g., a disease related moiety, a self-molecule of the subject, a molecule from a pathogen in the subject, or a molecule from a pathogen that is capable of being within the subject, etc.) by administering an unnatural immunogen that comprises one or more unnatural amino acid to the subject. Antibodies against the immunogen, which corresponds to a target moiety that does not comprise unnatural amino acids, are produced by the subject, which antibodies are cross-reactive against the particular target moiety. Again, it will be appreciated that the antibodies produced are not necessarily specific for the epitope on the target moiety that corresponds to the epitope that has the unnatural amino acid on the unnatural immunogen. The methods of the invention can be used to break immunological tolerance in a subject in regard to the target (e.g., disease related) moiety. Also, while described herein in terms of production via an orthogonal translation system or other direct incorporation methods (see below), the immunogenic unnatural antigens can be, once created, modified through other methods as well (e.g., chemical modification, etc.). Such indirect methods are typically used in conjunction with or in addition to direct incorporation methods such as orthogonal methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs explained in more detail below, the immunogen used to produce the immunological response in the subject typically comprises an âunnaturalâ version of a target moiety within a subject or a target moiety that is capable of being within the subject (e.g., a moiety from a bacteria that could infect the subject, a moiety from a tumor that could arise in the subject, etc.). In other words, the unnatural immunogen optionally comprises the same amino acid sequence/structure as the target moiety, except that one or more amino acid residue in the target moiety has been substituted with an unnatural amino acid (see Example sections below for additional illustration). Alternately or additionally, the unnatural immunogen can comprise the amino acid sequence of the target moiety along with one or more additional unnatural amino acid residues. In particular embodiments, the replacement and/or additional unnatural amino acid(s) does not change (or only slightly) changes the conformational structure of the unnatural immunogen as compared to the original target moiety. Thus, the tertiary and/or quaternary structure of the unnatural immunogen and the target moiety can be the same, or can be very similar to one another. Placement of the one or more unnatural amino acids in the unnatural immunogen is optionally chosen based on, e.g., whether placement in that location would change the conformation of the immunogen vs. the target moiety from which it is derived, whether the location allows the unnatural amino acid to be antibody accessible (e.g., can an antibody bind to the area comprising the unnatural amino acid), etc. The unnatural amino acid that is incorporated into the unnatural immunogen can be a conservative or non-conservative replacement (as compared to the corresponding natural amino acid in the target moiety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther embodiments of the invention are drawn to methods of prophylactically and/or therapeutically treating a subject by administering one or more unnatural immunogen and/or administering antibodies against one or more such unnatural immunogen that are cross-reactive with the corresponding natural target moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also includes embodiments comprising methods of producing a vaccine by identifying a target moiety (e.g., a disease-related moiety) that is at least putatively susceptible to treatment (e.g., TNFÎ±). It will be appreciated that such target moiety is typically ânaturalâ and does not comprise any unnatural amino acids. The methods also comprise providing an unnatural immunogen, i.e., a corresponding âunnaturalâ version of the target moiety and which comprises one or more unnatural amino acid, e.g., a replacement and/or additional unnatural amino acid. Again, the immunogen can comprise the same or nearly the same structural conformation as the target moiety such that administration of the unnatural immunogen to a subject elicits antibodies against the immunogen that are cross-reactive against the target moiety. The invention also comprises vaccines produced by such methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that in the various embodiments herein, the natural target moiety may or may not be present in the subject when the immunological response is created and/or when prophylactic treatment is administered, etc. Thus, when a target moiety herein is described as being in or within a subject, it should be appreciated that such also includes wherein the target moiety is capable of being within the subject. Thus, the target moiety could be from a tumor that could arise in the subject, or from an infectious agent that could infect the subject, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, as explained throughout, in various embodiments, the target moiety can be a disease related moiety, an innate moiety, a foreign moiety, etc. The target moiety can be non-immunogenic by itself or can be partially or weakly immunogenic, etc. The target moieties that are foreign can be from any organism (e.g., bacteria, virus, etc.). The target moieties that are self can be any self antigen (e.g., tumor associated, etc.). The unnatural amino acid that is incorporated into the unnatural immunogen can be any unnatural amino acid, see below, and can be located anywhere within the immunogen. When compared to the natural amino acid in the target moiety, the replacement unnatural amino acid in the immunogen can be a conservative or a non-conservative replacement. Also, as described further below, the unnatural immunogens can be created through any of a number of direct incorporation methods (e.g., orthogonal translation, solid-phase synthesis, etc.). Typical embodiments herein do not create unnatural immunogens though indirect incorporation methods such as post-translational modification or chemical modification (but such can optionally be used in conjunction with or in addition to direct incorporation methods such as orthogonal translation or can be used after direct incorporation methods such as orthogonal translation).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisease States and Disease-Related Target Moieties\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods and compositions of the invention can be used to prophylactically and/or therapeutically treat a wide variety of medical conditions/disease states.

Those of skill in the art will be familiar with numerous tumor associated antigens and corresponding cancers and self antigens and immune disorders that can be addressed through the current invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the invention comprises treatment for HIV infection, wherein the unnatural antigen can correspond to a target disease-related moiety associated with HIV/AIDS, e.g., gp120, gp41, gp160, etc. Other exemplary HIV moieties include, but are not limited to: gag, pol, env, tat, nef, and rev.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the invention can be

treatment of an ectoparasite infection and the unnatural immunogens created can correspond to a target disease-related moiety associated with an ectoparasite. Such ectoparasite can include, e.g., fleas; ticks, including hard ticks and soft ticks; flies, such as midges, mosquitoes, sand flies, black flies, horse flies, horn flies, deer flies, tsetse flies, stable flies, myiasis-causing flies and biting gnats; ants; spiders, lice; mites; and true bugs, such as bed bugs and kissing bugs. In yet other embodiments, the immunogen can correspond to a target moiety of a pollen or an allergen.\n\n\n \nUnnatural Amino Acids\n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein, an unnatural amino acid refers to any amino acid, modified amino acid, or amino acid analogue other than selenocysteine and/or pyrrolysine and the following twenty canonical genetically encoded alpha-amino acids: alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, valine. In various embodiments of the invention, the one or more unnatural amino acid that is incorporated into the unnatural immunogen can be any unnatural amino acid. Thus, it will be appreciated that recitation of specific unnatural amino acids herein should not necessarily be taken as limiting on the invention. A wide variety of unnatural amino acids have been incorporated into proteins by coding for them in vivo, e.g., using translation systems that comprise orthogonal elements. See, e.g., Liu, et al. (2007) âGenetic incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins in mammalian cellsâ \nNat Methods \n4:239-244; Wang, et al. (2006) âExpanding the genetic codeâ \nAnnu Rev Biophys Biomol Struct \n35:225-249; Xie & Schultz (2006) âA chemical toolkit for proteinsâan expanded genetic codeâ \nNat Rev Mol Cell Biol \n7:775-782; Wang and Schultz âExpanding the Genetic Code,â \nAngewandte Chemie Int. Ed., \n44(1):34-66 (2005) and Chin, et al. (2003) âAn expanded eukaryotic genetic codeâ \nScience \n301:964-967 for a review.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, in various embodiments of the present invention, unnatural amino acids can be incorporated into immunogens in vitro, e.g., using biosynthetic methods in which a suppressor tRNA is chemically acylated with a desired unnatural amino acid and is added to an in vitro extract capable of supporting immunogen biosynthesis. For a description of such in vitro synthetic methods, see, e.g., V. W. Cornish, D. Mendel and P. G. Schultz, \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., \n1995, 34:621 (1995); C. J. Noren, S. J. Anthony-Cahill, M. C. Griffith, P. G. Schultz, âA general method for site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins,â \nScience \n244 182-188 (1989); and, J. D. Bain, C. G. Glabe, T. A. Dix, A. R. Chamberlin, E. S. Diala, âBiosynthetic site-specific incorporation of a non-natural amino acid into a polypeptide,â \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n111 8013-8014 (1989). Unnatural amino acids can also be added to naturally or synthetically produced proteins by available synthetic peptide chemistries (or natural amino acids can be converted to unnatural amino acids by such methods), or by post-translational processing. Again, however, it will be appreciated that such post-translation and chemical modifications are typically done in conjunction with, or in addition to, incorporation of one or more unnatural amino acids during synthesis of a molecule (e.g., direct incorporation such as orthogonal translation, solid-phase synthesis, etc.). Thus, post-translational addition or chemical modification of amino acids are typically done, if at all, only on molecules already having unnatural amino acids that were added during the synthesis of the molecule. Further information on non-orthogonal incorporation of unnatural amino acids into immunogens is given below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe generic structure of an alpha-amino acid is illustrated by Formula I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn unnatural amino acid is typically any structure having Formula I wherein the R group is any substituent other than one used in the twenty natural amino acids. See, e.g., \nBiochemistry \nby L. Stryer, 3\nrd \ned. 1988, Freeman and Company, New York, for structures of the twenty natural amino acids. Note that, the unnatural amino acids of the invention, e.g., used to enhance an immunological response, can be naturally occurring compounds other than the twenty alpha-amino acids above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBecause the unnatural amino acids used herein typically differ from the natural amino acids in side chain, the unnatural amino acids form amide bonds with other amino acids, e.g., natural or unnatural, in the same manner in which they are formed in naturally occurring proteins. However, the unnatural amino acids have side chain groups that distinguish them from the natural amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn unnatural amino acids, for example, R in Formula I optionally comprises an alkyl-, aryl-, acyl-, hydrazine, cyano-, halo-, hydrazide, alkenyl, ether, borate, boronate, phospho, phosphono, phosphine, enone, imine, ester, hydroxylamine, amine, and the like, or any combination thereof. Other unnatural amino acids of interest include, but are not limited to, amino acids comprising a photoactivatable cross-linker, spin-labeled amino acids, fluorescent amino acids, metal binding amino acids, metal-containing amino acids, radioactive amino acids, amino acids with novel functional groups, amino acids that covalently or noncovalently interact with other molecules, photocaged and/or photoisomerizable amino acids, biotin or biotin-analogue containing amino acids, keto containing amino acids, glycosylated amino acids, a saccharide moiety attached to the amino acid side chain, amino acids comprising polyethylene glycol or polyether, heavy atom substituted amino acids, chemically cleavable or photocleavable amino acids, amino acids with an elongated side chain as compared to natural amino acids (e.g., polyethers or long chain hydrocarbons, e.g., greater than about 5, greater than about 10 carbons, etc.), carbon-linked sugar-containing amino acids, amino thioacid containing amino acids, and amino acids containing one or more toxic moiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention can utilize unnatural amino acids having the general structure illustrated by Formula IV below:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn unnatural amino acid having this structure is typically any structure where R\n1 \nis a substituent used in one of the twenty natural amino acids (e.g., tyrosine or phenylalanine) and R\n2 \nis a substituent such that R2âR1 together is other than a side chain of any of the 20 canonical natural amino acids. Thus, this type of unnatural amino acid can be viewed as a natural amino acid derivative.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnnatural amino acids can also optionally comprise modified backbone structures, e.g., as illustrated by the structures of Formula II and III:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein Z typically comprises OH, NH\n2\n, SH, NHâRâ², or SâRâ²; X and Y, which can be the same or different, typically comprise S or O, and R and Râ², which are optionally the same or different, are typically any substituent other than H (where R is of the L configuration if Râ² is H). For example, unnatural amino acids herein can optionally comprise substitutions in the amino or carboxyl group as illustrated by Formulas II and III. Unnatural amino acids of this type include, but are not limited to, Î±-hydroxy acids, Î±-thioacids Î±-aminothiocarboxylates, e.g., with side chains corresponding to the common twenty natural amino acids or unnatural side chains. In addition, substitutions at the Î±-carbon optionally include L, D, or Î±-Î±-disubstituted amino acids such as D-glutamate, D-alanine, D-methyl-O-tyrosine, aminobutyric acid, and the like. Other structural alternatives include cyclic amino acids, such as proline analogues as well as 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 membered ring proline analogues, Î² and Î³ amino acids such as substituted Î²-alanine and Î³-amino butyric acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some aspects, the invention utilizes unnatural amino acids in the L-configuration. However, it is not intended that the invention be limited to the use of L-configuration unnatural amino acids. It is contemplated that the D-enantiomers of these unnatural amino acids also find use with the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious embodiments of the invention can also include, tyrosine analogs which include para-substituted tyrosines, ortho-substituted tyrosines, and meta substituted tyrosines, wherein the substituted tyrosine comprises an alkynyl group, acetyl group, a benzoyl group, an amino group, a hydrazine, an hydroxyamine, a thiol group, a carboxy group, an isopropyl group, a methyl group, a C\n6\n-C\n20 \nstraight chain or branched hydrocarbon, a saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon, an O-methyl group, a polyether group, a nitro group, or the like. In addition, multiply substituted aryl rings are also contemplated.

Other unnatural amino acids that can be included in various embodiments of the invention include, e.g., p-nitrophenylalanine; an o-nitrophenylalanine; an m-nitrophenylalanine; a p-boronyl Phe; an o-boronyl Phe; an m-boronyl Phe; a p-amino Phe; an o-amino Phe; an m-amino Phe; a p-acyl Phe; an o-acyl Phe; an m-acyl Phe; a p-OMe Phe; an o-OMe Phe; an m-OMe Phe; a p-sulfo Phe; an o-sulfo Phe; an m-sulfo Phe; a 5-nitro His; a 3-nitro Tyr; a 2-nitro Tyr; a nitro substituted Leu; a nitro substituted His; a nitro substituted Ile; a nitro substituted Trp; a 2-nitro Trp; a 4-nitro Trp; a 5-nitro Trp; a 6-nitro Trp; a 7-nitro Trp; 3-aminotyrosine, 2-aminotyrosine, O-sulfotyrosine, 2-sulfooxyphenylalanine, 3-sulfooxyoxyphenylalanine or p-carboxyphenylalanine, o-carboxyphenyalanine, and m-carboxyphenylalanine. Yet other embodiments can comprise unnatural amino acids such as an aliphatic, aryl or heterocycle substituted boronic acid, a p-boronophenylalanine, an o-boronophenylalanine, or an m-boronophenylalanine. In the various embodiments herein, the unnatural immunogen comprises one or more of the 20 naturally occurring canonical amino acids that has been glycosylated, nitroaryl modified, nitrated, alkylated, acetylated, oxidized, sulfated, or phosphorylated (e.g., glycosylated, nitroaryl modified, nitrated, alkylated, acetylated, oxidized, sulfated, or phosphorylated by a process other than post-translational modification or by a process other than chemical modification). The structures of a variety of unnatural amino acids that can be incorporated using orthogonal translation systems are known. See the references cited herein, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemical Synthesis of Unnatural Amino Acids\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany of the unnatural amino acids provided above are commercially available, e.g., from Sigma (USA) or Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis., USA). Those that are not commercially available are optionally synthesized as provided in various publications or using standard methods known to those of skill in the art. For organic synthesis techniques, see, e.g., \nOrganic Chemistry \nby Fessendon and Fessendon, (1982, Second Edition, Willard Grant Press, Boston Mass.); \nAdvanced Organic Chemistry \nby March (Third Edition, 1985, Wiley and Sons, New York); and \nAdvanced Organic Chemistry \nby Carey and Sundberg (Third Edition, Parts A and B, 1990, Plenum Press, New York).

See also, International Publication WO 2004/058946, entitled âPROTEIN ARRAYS,â filed on Dec. 22, 2003.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCellular Uptake of Unnatural Amino Acids\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnnatural amino acid uptake by a cell is one issue that is typically considered when designing and selecting unnatural amino acids, e.g., for incorporation into an immunogen via genetically coding orthogonal pairs (an ORS that charges an OtRNA that recognizes a selector codon). For example, the high charge density of Î±-amino acids may limit uptake. Natural amino acids are taken up into the cell via a collection of protein-based transport systems often displaying varying degrees of amino acid specificity. A rapid screen can be done which assesses which unnatural amino acids are taken up by cells. See, e.g., the toxicity assays in, e.g., International Publication WO 2004/058946, entitled âPROTEIN ARRAYS,â filed on Dec. 22, 2003; and Liu and Schultz (1999) âProgress toward the evolution of an organism with an expanded genetic code,â \nPNAS \n96:4780-4785. Although uptake is easily analyzed with various assays, an alternative to designing unnatural amino acids that are amenable to cellular uptake pathways is to provide biosynthetic pathways to create amino acids in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBiosynthesis of Unnatural Amino Acids\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany biosynthetic pathways already exist in cells for the production of amino acids and other compounds. While a biosynthetic method for a particular unnatural amino acid may not exist in nature, e.g., in a cell, various embodiments of the invention provide such methods. For example, biosynthetic pathways for unnatural amino acids are optionally generated in a host cell by adding new enzymes or modifying existing host cell pathways. Additional new enzymes are optionally naturally occurring enzymes or artificially evolved enzymes. For example, the biosynthesis of p-aminophenylalanine (as presented in WO 2002/085923, supra) relies on the addition of a combination of known enzymes from other organisms. The genes for these enzymes can be introduced into a cell by transforming the cell with a plasmid comprising the genes. The genes, when expressed in the cell, provide an enzymatic pathway to synthesize the desired compound. Examples of the types of enzymes optionally added can be found, e.g., in Genbank. Artificially evolved enzymes are also optionally added into a cell in the same manner. In this manner, the cellular machinery and resources of a cell are manipulated to produce unnatural amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndeed, any of a variety of methods can be used for producing novel enzymes for use in biosynthetic pathways, or for evolution of existing pathways, for the production of unnatural amino acids, in vitro or in vivo. Many available methods of evolving enzymes and other biosynthetic pathway components can be applied to the present invention to produce unnatural amino acids (or, indeed, to evolve synthetases to have new substrate specificities or other activities of interest). For example, DNA shuffling is optionally used to develop novel enzymes and/or pathways of such enzymes for the production of unnatural amino acids (or production of new synthetases), in vitro or in vivo. See, e.g., Stemmer (1994) âRapid evolution of a protein in vitro by DNA shuffling,â \nNature \n370(4):389-391; and Stemmer (1994)âDNA shuffling by random fragmentation and reassembly: In vitro recombination for molecular evolution,â \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., \n91:10747-10751. A related approach shuffles families of related (e.g., homologous) genes to quickly evolve enzymes with desired characteristics. An example of such âfamily gene shufflingâ methods is found in Crameri, et al., (1998) âDNA shuffling of a family of genes from diverse species accelerates directed evolutionâ \nNature, \n391(6664): 288-291. New enzymes (whether biosynthetic pathway components or synthetases) can also be generated using a DNA recombination procedure known as âincremental truncation for the creation of hybrid enzymesâ (âITCHYâ), e.g., as described in Ostermeier, et al., (1999) âA combinatorial approach to hybrid enzymes independent of DNA homologyâ \nNature Biotech \n17:1205. This approach can also be used to generate a library of enzyme or other pathway variants which can serve as substrates for one or more in vitro or in vivo recombination methods. See also, Ostermeier, et al. (1999) âCombinatorial Protein Engineering by Incremental Truncation,â \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, \n96: 3562-67, and Ostermeier, et al. (1999), âIncremental Truncation as a Strategy in the Engineering of Novel Biocatalysts,â \nBiological and Medicinal Chemistry, \n7: 2139-44. Another approach optionally used herein uses exponential ensemble mutagenesis to produce libraries of enzyme or other pathway variants that are, e.g., selected for an ability to catalyze a biosynthetic reaction relevant to producing an unnatural amino acid (or a new synthetase). In this approach, small groups of residues in a sequence of interest are randomized in parallel to identify, at each altered position, amino acids which lead to functional proteins. Examples of such procedures, which can be adapted to the present invention to produce new enzymes for the production of unnatural amino acids (or new synthetases) are found in Delegrave and Youvan (1993) \nBiotechnology Research \n11:1548-1552. In yet another approach, random or semi-random mutagenesis using doped or degenerate oligonucleotides for enzyme and/or pathway component engineering can be used, e.g., by using the general mutagenesis methods of, e.g., Arkin and Youvan (1992) âOptimizing nucleotide mixtures to encode specific subsets of amino acids for semi-random mutagenesisâ \nBiotechnology \n10:297-300; or Reidhaar-Olson, et al. (1991) âRandom mutagenesis of protein sequences using oligonucleotide cassettes,â \nMethods Enzymol. \n208:564-86. Yet another approach, often termed a ânon-stochasticâ mutagenesis, which uses polynucleotide reassembly and site-saturation mutagenesis can be used to produce enzymes and/or pathway components, which can then be screened for an ability to perform one or more synthetase or biosynthetic pathway function (e.g., for the production of unnatural amino acids in vivo). See, e.g., Short âNON-STOCHASTIC GENERATION OF GENETIC VACCINES AND ENZYMESâ WO 00/46344.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn alternative to such mutational methods involves recombining entire genomes of organisms and selecting resulting progeny for particular pathway functions (often referred to as âwhole genome shufflingâ). This approach can be applied to various embodiments of the present invention, e.g., by genomic recombination and selection of an organism (e.g., an \nE. coli \nor other cell) for an ability to produce an unnatural amino acid (or intermediate thereof). For example, methods taught in the following publications can be applied to pathway design for the evolution of existing and/or new pathways in cells to produce unnatural amino acids in vivo: Patnaik, et al. (2002) âGenome shuffling of \nlactobacillus \nfor improved acid toleranceâ \nNature Biotechnology, \n20(7):707-712; and Zhang, et al. (2002) âGenome shuffling leads to rapid phenotypic improvement in bacteriaâ \nNature\n, February 7, 415(6872):644-646.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther techniques for organism and metabolic pathway engineering, e.g., for the production of desired compounds are also available and can also be applied to the production of unnatural amino acids. Examples of publications teaching useful pathway engineering approaches include: Nakamura and White (2003) âMetabolic engineering for the microbial production of 1,3 propanediolâ \nCurr. Opin. Biotechnol. \n14(5):454-9; Berry, et al. (2002) âApplication of Metabolic Engineering to improve both the production and use of Biotech Indigoâ \nJ. Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology \n28:127-133; Banta, et al. (2002) âOptimizing an artificial metabolic pathway: Engineering the cofactor specificity of \n \nCorynebacterium\n \n2,5-diketo-D-gluconic acid reductase for use in vitamin C biosynthesisâ \nBiochemistry, \n41(20):6226-36; Selivonova, et al. (2001) âRapid Evolution of Novel Traits in Microorganismsâ \nApplied and Environmental Microbiology, \n67:3645, and many others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegardless of the method used, typically, the unnatural amino acid produced with an engineered biosynthetic pathway is produced in a concentration sufficient for efficient protein biosynthesis, e.g., a natural cellular amount, but not to such a degree as to significantly affect the concentration of other cellular amino acids or to exhaust cellular resources. Typical concentrations produced in vivo in this manner are about 10 mM to about 0.05 mM. Once a cell is engineered to produce enzymes desired for a specific pathway and an unnatural amino acid is generated, in vivo selections are optionally used to further optimize the production of the unnatural amino acid for both ribosomal protein synthesis and cell growth.\n\n\n \nUnnatural Immunogens\n\n\n \n \n \nThe unnatural immunogen used herein to produce the immunological response in the subject typically comprises an âunnaturalâ version of a target (e.g., disease-related) moiety within a subject or a target moiety that is capable of being within the subject (e.g., a moiety from a bacteria that could infect the subject, a moiety from a tumor that could arise in the subject, etc.). In other words, the unnatural immunogen optionally comprises the same amino acid sequence/structure as the target moiety, except that one or more amino acid residues in the target moiety have been substituted with an unnatural amino acid (see Examples section below for illustration). Alternately or additionally, the unnatural immunogen can comprise the same amino acid sequence as the target moiety but along with one or more additional unnatural amino acid residues. The unnatural immunogens of the invention can comprise, e.g., 10 or more unnatural amino acids, 5-10 unnatural amino acids, 5 or fewer unnatural amino acids, or 2 or fewer unnatural amino acids, etc. An unnatural immunogen can comprise, e.g., 10% or more, 5-10%, 5% or less, 2% or less, or 1% or less percentage of unnatural amino acids as compared to total amino acids. Again, as will be appreciated, the unnatural immunogens herein can comprise one or more of a number of different unnatural amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLocation of the one or more unnatural amino acids in an unnatural immunogen of the invention should also not necessarily be taken as limiting. Thus, for example, an unnatural amino acid can be present at either the C or N terminus of an immunogen, or the unnatural amino acid can be present anywhere internally in the primary amino acid sequence of the immunogen. See, Examples section below. Placement of the unnatural amino acid(s) (and also choice of the particular unnatural amino acid) can optionally be guided by a number of considerations. For example, the location/choice of the unnatural amino acid can optionally not significantly alter the structural conformation of the immunogen vs. the natural target protein moiety from which it is derived (to which it corresponds). Thus, the structural conformation of the resulting unnatural immunogen can optionally still closely match that of the corresponding natural target moiety, such that antibody cross-reactivity occurs. Therefore, in some embodiments herein, the particular unnatural amino acid and its particular location within an immunogen can be chosen to minimize structural (e.g., tertiary/quaternary) changes to the immunogen as compared to the natural target moiety. In some embodiments, the choice of unnatural amino acid and the choice of its placement can also be influenced by whether such choice/placement will help in decreasing infectivity, cytotoxicity, etc. The unnatural amino acid(s) incorporated into the immunogen can optionally be structurally distinct from the natural amino acid(s) they replace. Thus, in some embodiments, the particular unnatural amino acid is a nonconservative alternative to the natural amino acid in the target moiety. See Examples below where a Lys residue in a target moiety was replaced with a pNO\n2\nPhe in the unnatural immunogen. In the other embodiments, the unnatural amino acid is a conservative alternative to the natural amino acid. Also, the location of the unnatural amino acid in the immunogen can be influenced by antibody accessibility and/or its ability to generate a serum antibody, B-cell, and/or T-cell response. Thus, in the various unnatural immunogens of the invention, the unnatural amino acid can be antibody accessible, e.g., surface exposed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, the unnatural amino acid can be any unnatural amino acid. Further to the above, unnatural amino acids that can be used in the invention have side chain groups that distinguish them from the natural amino acids, although unnatural amino acids can be naturally occurring compounds other than the twenty proteinogenic alpha-amino acids. The unnatural amino acids finding use with the invention can include an O-methyl-L-tyrosine, an L-3-(2-naphthyl)alanine, a 3-methyl-phenylalanine, an O-4-allyl-L-tyrosine, a 4-propyl-L-tyrosine, a tri-O-acetyl-GlcNAcb-serine, an L-Dopa, a fluorinated phenylalanine, an isopropyl-L-phenylalanine, a p-azido-L-phenylalanine, a p-acyl-L-phenylalanine, a p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine, an L-phosphoserine, a phosphonoserine, a phosphonotyrosine, a p-iodo-phenylalanine, a p-bromophenylalanine, a p-amino-L-phenylalanine, an isopropyl-L-phenylalanine, an unnatural analogue of a tyrosine amino acid; an unnatural analogue of a glutamine amino acid; an unnatural analogue of a phenylalanine amino acid; an unnatural analogue of a serine amino acid; an unnatural analogue of a threonine amino acid; an alkyl, aryl, acyl, azido, cyano, halo, hydrazine, hydrazide, hydroxyl, alkenyl, alkynl, ether, thiol, sulfonyl, seleno, ester, thioacid, borate, boronate, phospho, phosphono, phosphine, heterocyclic, enone, imine, aldehyde, hydroxylamine, keto, or amino substituted amino acid, or any combination thereof; an amino acid with a photoactivatable cross-linker; a spin-labeled amino acid; a fluorescent amino acid; an amino acid with a novel functional group; an amino acid that covalently or noncovalently interacts with another molecule; a metal binding amino acid; a metal-containing amino acid; a radioactive amino acid; a photocaged and/or photoisomerizable amino acid; a biotin or biotin-analogue containing amino acid; a glycosylated or carbohydrate modified amino acid; a keto containing amino acid; amino acids comprising polyethylene glycol or polyether; a heavy atom substituted amino acid; a chemically cleavable or photocleavable amino acid; an amino acid with an elongated side chain; an amino acid containing a toxic group; a sugar substituted amino acid, e.g., a sugar substituted serine or the like; a carbon-linked sugar-containing amino acid; a redox-active amino acid; an a-hydroxy containing acid; an amino thio acid containing amino acid; an a,a disubstituted amino acid; a b-amino acid; and a cyclic amino acid other than proline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn various embodiments, the unnatural immunogens herein, e.g., unnatural TNFÎ±s, can comprise one or more of: p-nitrophenylalanine; an o-nitrophenylalanine; an m-nitrophenylalanine; a p-boronyl Phe; an o-boronyl Phe; an m-boronyl Phe; a p-amino Phe; an o-amino Phe; an m-amino Phe; a p-acyl Phe; an o-acyl Phe; an m-acyl Phe; a p-OMe Phe; an o-OMe Phe; an m-OMe Phe; a p-sulfo Phe; an o-sulfo Phe; an m-sulfo Phe; a 5-nitro His; a 3-nitro Tyr; a 2-nitro Tyr; a nitro substituted Leu; a nitro substituted His; a nitro substituted Be; a nitro substituted Trp; a 2-nitro Trp; a 4-nitro Trp; a 5-nitro Trp; a 6-nitro Trp; a 7-nitro Trp; 3-aminotyrosine, 2-aminotyrosine, O-sulfotyrosine, 2-sulfooxyphenylalanine, 3-sulfooxyoxyphenylalanine or p-carboxyphenylalanine, o-carboxyphenyalanine, and m-carboxyphenylalanine. Again, it will be appreciated that recitation of particular unnatural amino acids should not be taken as limiting on the invention, and that other unnatural amino acids, e.g., as noted herein, can also be used with the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose of skill in the art will be readily familiar with determination of protein shape/conformation and determination of the effect, if any, of incorporation of an unnatural amino acid into a particular polypeptide, e.g., through use of protein crystallography, NMR, etc. Examples of production of an unnatural immunogen and determination of structural conformation and antibody accessibility of such an immunogen are shown in the Examples below. Such determination can optionally aid in choice and/or placement of particular unnatural amino acids in an unnatural immunogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe unnatural immunogens of the invention can be based on numerous target moieties and can include not only polypeptides/proteins, but also polypeptides/proteins associated with carbohydrates, lipids, haptens and/or other non-proteinaceous molecules. An immunogen of the invention can include, but is not limited to, any of the target (e.g., disease-related) moieties described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one class of useful embodiments described herein, the unnatural immunogen comprises unnatural TNFÎ± and can comprise a highly immunogenic (E. Keinan, Ed. \nCatalytic Antibodies \n(Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005) pp. 1-28), structurally conservative, antibody accessible p-nitrophenylalanine (pNO\n2\nPhe, \nFIG. 1A\n), e.g., pNO\n2\nPhe\n86\nTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n11\n-mTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n19\n-mTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n21\n-mTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n42\n-mTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n49\n-mTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n104\n-mTNFÎ±, or pNO\n2\nPhe\n113\n-mTNFÎ±. In such embodiments, the substitution mutation permits the unnatural mTNFÎ± to maintain a tertiary and quaternary protein structure that is substantially similar to that of the natural mTNFÎ±, thus increasing the probability that neutralizing antibodies produced against the unnatural mTNFÎ± can cross react with corresponding epitopes on the wt mTNFÎ±. As detailed elsewhere herein, the replacement of and/or addition of an unnatural amino acid optionally does not change (or does not significantly change) the conformational structure of the unnatural mTNFÎ± as compared to the endogenous mTNFÎ±. Unnatural hTNFÎ± that can find use in therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatments in a human subject include a pNO\n2\nPhe\n11\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n19\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n21\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n42\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n49\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n87\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n105\n-hTNFÎ±, or a pNO\n2\nPhe\n114\n-hTNFÎ±.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, elevated serum levels of TNFÎ± are associated with a variety of disease states. It will be appreciated, however, that a subject in whom the immunological response is created and/or to whom the prophylactic treatment is administered, etc. may not exhibit at serum TNFÎ± levels that represent a disease state. Thus, it should be appreciated that the antibodies, and/or the unnatural immunogens of the invention can be administered both to individuals who do exhibit a TNFÎ±-associated disease as well as those who do not.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments of the invention, the unnatural immunogen can comprise an unnatural RBP4, e.g., to treat and/or prevent RBP4-associated disease states. Any natural RBP4 can be substituted with one or more unnatural amino acid to produce an unnatural RBP4. As will be appreciated, and as for TNFÎ± or any other target moiety, the substitution need not (but can) replace the natural amino acid with a structurally conservative unnatural amino acid. Alternatively or additionally, one or more additional unnatural amino acids can be added to an RBP4 polypeptide (rather than âreplaceâ natural amino acids within it) to produce an unnatural RBP4. As described above for unnatural TNFÎ± immunogens, and again, as for any other immunogen construction herein, an unnatural RBP4 can optionally comprise a structure that is substantially similar to the natural RBP4, thus increasing the probability that neutralizing antibodies produced against the unnatural RBP4 can cross react with corresponding epitopes on the natural RBP4 (whether or not such epitopes in the target RBP4 correspond to the epitope(s) in the unnatural RBP4 that have an unnatural amino acid). Of course, here too, any unnatural amino acid in an unnatural immunogen that is used to replace a natural amino acid in a target moiety does not need to be a conservative substitution. See Examples below. Unnatural RBP4s that can find use in therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatments in a subject include a pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4 and a pNO\n2\nPhe\n108\nmRBP4 as well as their corresponding human counterparts.\n\n\n \nProduction of Unnatural Immunogens\n\n\n \n \n \nAs will be appreciated, the unnatural immunogens of the invention can be constructed through a variety of methods, typically direct incorporation methods. Thus, while the description and examples herein primarily focus on use of orthogonal translation systems to incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins, other methods can also optionally be used to create the unnatural immunogens to be administered to a subject, e.g., to produce an immunological response against the target moiety to which the immunogen corresponds, or to produce the unnatural immunogens used in the creation of cross-reactive antibodies that are to be administered to a subject to, e.g., neutralize a target moiety. In many embodiments, the unnatural amino acid is added to the unnatural immunogen during construction of the immunogen (e.g., during the construction of the immunogen through orthogonal translation, in vitro synthesis or chemo-synthetic methods, etc.) rather than through post-translational modification or chemical modification of a natural amino acid in the molecule after it has been synthesized (although such methods can optionally be used in combination with or in addition to direct incorporation approaches). Therefore, while particular methods of constructing molecules that comprise unnatural amino acids are detailed herein, e.g., orthogonal translation, they such should not necessarily be taken as limiting. Other methods of constructing molecules having unnatural amino acids that include non-post-translational and non-chemical modification are also included herein in the many embodiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that genetic incorporation of unnatural amino acids into immunogens (e.g., through orthogonal translation systems such as those described and referenced to herein) can, in some embodiments, offer benefits over generation of unnatural immunogens through solid-phase peptide synthesis or other similar in vitro methods. For example, the genetic incorporation of unnatural amino acids into immunogens in vivo uses the biosynthetic machinery of living cells to synthesize the unnatural immunogen. Such in vivo production can produce an accurate functional immunogen (or any other moiety) similar to the native (natural) target moiety, but with the added active/functional groups introduced via the unnatural amino acids. This, thus, helps generate a robust immune response that is cross-reactive with a native (natural) target moiety or wild-type moiety. Furthermore, use of the novel biotechnological tool of in vivo incorporation of unnatural amino acids, can help produce the proper native conformation of immunogens (i.e., similar or identical to that of the corresponding target moiety) with high yields at low cost. Total synthesis of proteins with unnatural amino acids using other in vitro methods such as solid-phase peptide synthesis can in some embodiments be more targeted to shorter molecules (e.g., Ë60-100 amino acids) as well as producing denatured proteins at a lower yield which can optionally be ligated together, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrthogonal tRNA/Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase Technology\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs explained herein, unnatural immunogens used in the invention to produce an immunological response against a natural target moiety (either innate or foreign to a subject) are typically constructed through orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase systems. Thus, an understanding of the novel compositions and methods of the present invention is further developed through an understanding of the activities associated with orthogonal tRNA and orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pairs. In general, in order to add unnatural amino acids to the genetic code, new orthogonal pairs comprising an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and a suitable tRNA are needed that can function efficiently in the host translational machinery, but that are âorthogonalâ to the translation system at issue. Thus, the orthogonal moieties function independently of the synthetases and tRNAs endogenous to the translation system. Desired characteristics of the orthogonal pair include tRNA that decode or recognize only a specific codon, such as a selector codon, e.g., an amber stop codon, that is not decoded by any endogenous tRNA, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that preferentially aminoacylates, or âchargesâ its cognate tRNA with only one specific unnatural amino acid. The O-tRNA is also not typically aminoacylated, or is poorly aminoacylated, i.e., charged, by endogenous synthetases. For example, in an \nE. coli \nhost system, an orthogonal pair will include an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that does not cross-react with any of the endogenous tRNA, of which there are 40 endogenous in \nE. coli\n, and an orthogonal tRNA that is not aminoacylated by any of the endogenous synthetases, of which there are 21 in \nE. coli. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe general principles of orthogonal translation systems that are suitable for making proteins that comprise one or more unnatural amino acid in the invention are known in the art, as are the general methods for producing orthogonal translation systems.

See, e.g., \nBiochemistry \nby L. Stryer, 3rd ed. 1988, Freeman and Company, New York, for structures of the twenty natural amino acids. In various embodiments, the unnatural amino acid is any immunogenic amino acid (e.g., an immunogenic analogue of a common amino acid). Unnatural amino acids of the invention have side chain groups that distinguish them from the natural amino acids, although unnatural amino acids can be naturally occurring compounds other than the twenty proteinogenic alpha-amino acids. Non-limiting examples of unnatural amino acids that can be used in the immogens of the invention include an O-methyl-L-tyrosine, an L-3-(2-naphthyl)alanine, a 3-methyl-phenylalanine, an O-4-allyl-L-tyrosine, a 4-propyl-L-tyrosine, a tri-O-acetyl-GlcNAcb-serine, an L-Dopa, a fluorinated phenylalanine, an isopropyl-L-phenylalanine, a p-azido-L-phenylalanine, a p-acyl-L-phenylalanine, a p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine, an L-phosphoserine, a phosphonoserine, a phosphonotyrosine, a p-iodo-phenylalanine, a p-bromophen ylalanine, a p-amino-L-phenylalanine, an isopropyl-L-phenylalanine, an unnatural analogue of a tyrosine amino acid; an unnatural analogue of a glutamine amino acid; an unnatural analogue of a phenylalanine amino acid; an unnatural analogue of a serine amino acid; an unnatural analogue of a threonine amino acid; an alkyl, aryl, acyl, azido, cyano, halo, hydrazine, hydrazide, hydroxyl, alkenyl, alkynl, ether, thiol, sulfonyl, seleno, ester, thioacid, borate, boronate, phospho, phosphono, phosphine, heterocyclic, enone, imine, aldehyde, hydroxylamine, keto, or amino substituted amino acid, or any combination thereof; an amino acid with a photoactivatable cross-linker; a spin-labeled amino acid; a fluorescent amino acid; an amino acid with a novel functional group; an amino acid that covalently or noncovalently interacts with another molecule; a metal binding amino acid; a metal-containing amino acid; a radioactive amino acid; a photocaged and/or photoisomerizable amino acid; a biotin or biotin-analogue containing amino acid; a glycosylated or carbohydrate modified amino acid; a keto containing amino acid; amino acids comprising polyethylene glycol or polyether; a heavy atom substituted amino acid; a chemically cleavable or photocleavable amino acid; an amino acid with an elongated side chain; an amino acid containing a toxic group; a sugar substituted amino acid, e.g., a sugar substituted serine or the like; a carbon-linked sugar-containing amino acid; a redox-active amino acid; an a-hydroxy containing acid; an amino thio acid containing amino acid; an a,a disubstituted amino acid; a b-amino acid; and a cyclic amino acid other than proline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular embodiments, the unnatural immunogens herein, such as unnatural TNFÎ±s or any other unnatural immunogen, can comprise one or more of: p-nitrophenylalanine; an o-nitrophenylalanine; an m-nitrophenylalanine; a p-boronyl Phe; an o-boronyl Phe; an m-boronyl Phe; a p-amino Phe; an o-amino Phe; an m-amino Phe; a p-acyl Phe; an o-acyl Phe; an m-acyl Phe; a p-OMe Phe; an o-OMe Phe; an m-OMe Phe; a p-sulfo Phe; an o-sulfo Phe; an m-sulfo Phe; a 5-nitro His; a 3-nitro Tyr; a 2-nitro Tyr; a nitro substituted Leu; a nitro substituted His; a nitro substituted Be; a nitro substituted Trp; a 2-nitro Trp; a 4-nitro Trp; a 5-nitro Trp; a 6-nitro Trp; a 7-nitro Trp; 3-aminotyrosine, 2-aminotyrosine, O-sulfotyrosine, 2-sulfooxyphenylalanine, 3-sulfooxyoxyphenylalanine or p-carboxyphenylalanine, o-carboxyphenyalanine, and m-carboxyphenylalanine. Again, it will be appreciated that recitation of particular unnatural amino acids should not be taken as limiting on the invention, and that other unnatural amino acids (e.g., other immunogenic unnatural amino acids) can also be used with the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrthogonal Translation Systems\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrthogonal translation systems generally comprise cells, e.g., prokaryotic cells such as \nE. coli\n, that include an orthogonal tRNA (O-tRNA), an orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (OâRS), and an unnatural amino acid, e.g., para-nitrophenylalanine (pNO\n2\nPhe), para-carboxyphenylalanine, sulfotyrosine, etc. (see above), where the OâRS aminoacylates the O-tRNA with the unnatural amino acid. An orthogonal pair can include an O-tRNA, e.g., a suppressor tRNA, a frameshift tRNA, or the like, and a cognate OâRS. Orthogonal systems, that can be used to produce the unnatural proteins herein, which typically include O-tRNA/OâRS pairs, can comprise a cell or a cell-free environment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, when an orthogonal pair recognizes a selector codon and loads an amino acid in response to the selector codon, the orthogonal pair is said to âsuppressâ the selector codon. That is, a selector codon that is not recognized by the translation system's, e.g., the \nE. coli \ncell's, endogenous machinery is not ordinarily charged, which results in blocking production of a polypeptide that would otherwise be translated from the nucleic acid. In an orthogonal pair system, the OâRS aminoacylates the O-tRNA with a specific unnatural amino acid, e.g., para-nitrophenylalanine (pNO\n2\nPhe) as used in the Examples herein. The charged O-tRNA recognizes the selector codon and suppresses the translational block caused by the selector codon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe translation system, e.g., an \nE. coli \ncell, uses the O-tRNA/OâRS pair to incorporate an unnatural amino acid into a growing polypeptide chain, e.g., via a polynucleotide that encodes a polypeptide of interest (such as an unnatural immunogen that corresponds to a target moiety that is in or capable of being in a subject, etc.), where the polynucleotide comprises a selector codon that is recognized by the O-tRNA. In certain systems, the cell can include one or more additional O-tRNA/OâRS pairs, where an additional O-tRNA is loaded by an additional OâRS with a different unnatural amino acid. For example, one of the O-tRNAs can recognize a four base codon and the other O-tRNA can recognize a stop codon. Alternately, multiple different stop codons, multiple different four base codons, multiple different rare codons and/or multiple different non-coding codons can be used in the same coding nucleic acid. Thus, a single polypeptide, e.g., unnatural immunogen, can comprise multiple unnatural amino acids and/or different polypeptides created in the system can comprise different unnatural amino acids. For further details regarding available OâRS/O-tRNA cognate pairs and their use, see, e.g., the references noted elsewhere herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, some translational systems can comprise multiple O-tRNA/OâRS pairs, which allow incorporation of more than one unnatural amino acid into a polypeptide. For example, the translation system can further include an additional different O-tRNA/OâRS pair and a second unnatural amino acid, where this additional O-tRNA recognizes a second selector codon and this additional OâRS preferentially aminoacylates the O-tRNA with the second unnatural amino acid. For example, a cell that includes an O-tRNA/OâRS pair, where the O-tRNA recognizes, e.g., an amber selector codon, can further comprise a second orthogonal pair, where the second O-tRNA recognizes a different selector codon, e.g., an opal codon, an ochre codon, a four-base codon, a rare codon, a non-coding codon, or the like. In some systems, the different orthogonal pairs are derived from different sources, which can facilitate recognition of different selector codons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain translation systems can comprise a cell, such as an \nE. coli \ncell, that includes an orthogonal tRNA (O-tRNA), an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (OâRS), an unnatural amino acid, and a nucleic acid that comprises a polynucleotide that encodes a polypeptide of interest, e.g., an unnatural immunogen corresponding to a self-protein target of a subject, where the polynucleotide comprises the selector codon that is recognized by the O-tRNA. Although orthogonal translation systems can utilize cultured cells to produce proteins having unnatural amino acids, it is not intended that orthogonal translation systems used herein require an intact, viable cell. For example, an orthogonal translation system can utilize a cell-free system in the presence of a cell extract. Indeed, the use of cell free, in vitro transcription/translation systems for protein production is a well established technique. Adaptation of these in vitro systems to produce proteins having unnatural amino acids using orthogonal translation system components described herein is well within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe O-tRNA and/or the OâRS can be naturally occurring or can be, e.g., derived by mutation of a naturally occurring tRNA and/or RS, e.g., by generating libraries of tRNAs and/or libraries of RSs, from any of a variety of organisms and/or by using any of a variety of available mutation strategies. For example, one strategy for producing an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair involves importing a tRNA/synthetase pair that is heterologous to the system in which the pair will function from a source, or multiple sources, other than the translation system in which the tRNA/synthetase pair will be used. The properties of the heterologous synthetase candidate include, e.g., that it does not charge any host cell tRNA, and the properties of the heterologous tRNA candidate include, e.g., that it is not aminoacylated by any host cell synthetase. In addition, the heterologous tRNA is orthogonal to all host cell synthetases. A second strategy for generating an orthogonal pair involves generating mutant libraries from which to screen and/or select an O-tRNA or OâRS. Such strategies can also be combined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrthogonal tRNA (O-tRNA)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn orthogonal tRNA (O-tRNA) desirably mediates incorporation of an unnatural amino acid into a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide that comprises a selector codon recognized by the O-tRNA, e.g., in vivo or in vitro.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus compositions comprising an O-tRNA can further include an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (OâRS), where the OâRS preferentially aminoacylates the O-tRNA with an unnatural amino acid. Such compositions including an O-tRNA can further include a translation system, e.g., in vitro or in vivo. A nucleic acid that comprises a polynucleotide that encodes a polypeptide of interest, where the polynucleotide comprises a selector codon that is recognized by the O-tRNA, or a combination of one or more of these can also be present in the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for producing a recombinant orthogonal tRNA and screening its efficiency with respect to incorporating an unnatural amino acid into a polypeptide in response to a selector codon can be found in, e.g., International Application Publications WO 2002/086075, entitled âMETHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ORTHOGONAL tRNA AMINOACYL-tRNA SYNTHETASE PAIRSâ; WO 2004/094593, entitled âEXPANDING THE EUKARYOTIC GENETIC CODEâ; and WO 2005/019415, filed Jul. 7, 2004.

Additional details concerning such systems can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,045,337; 7,083,970; 7,238,510; 7,129,333; 7,262,040; 7,183,082; 7,199,222; and 7,217,809.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSource and Host Organisms\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe orthogonal translational components (O-tRNA and OâRS) that can optionally be used to create the unnatural immunogens of the invention, can be derived from any organism, or a combination of organisms, for use in a host translation system from any other species, with the caveat that the O-tRNA/OâRS components and the host system work in an orthogonal manner. It is not a requirement that the O-tRNA and the OâRS from an orthogonal pair be derived from the same organism. For example, the orthogonal components can be derived from archaebacterial genes for use in a eubacterial host system.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the orthogonal O-tRNA can be derived from an archaebacterium, such as \nMethanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Halobacterium \nsuch as \nHaloferax volcanii \nand \nHalobacterium \nspecies NRC-1, \nArchaeoglobus fulgidus, Pyrococcus furiosus, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Aeuropyrum pernix, Methanococcus maripaludis, Methanopyrus kandleri, Methanosarcina mazei \n(Mm), \nPyrobaculum aerophilum, Pyrococcus abyssi, Sulfolobus solfataricus \n(Ss), \nSulfolobus tokodaii, Thermoplasma acidophilum, Thermoplasma volcanium\n, or the like, or a \neubacterium\n, such as \nEscherichia coli, Thermus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermphilus\n, or the like, while the orthogonal OâRS can be derived from an organism or combination of organisms, e.g., an archaebacterium, such as \nMethanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Halobacterium \nsuch as \nHaloferax volcanii \nand \nHalobacterium \nspecies NRC-1, \nArchaeoglobus fulgidus, Pyrococcus furiosus, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Aeuropyrum pernix, Methanococcus maripaludis, Methanopyrus kandleri, Methanosarcina mazei, Pyrobaculum aerophilum, Pyrococcus abyssi, Sulfolobus solfataricus, Sulfolobus tokodaii, Thermoplasma acidophilum, Thermoplasma volcanium\n, or the like, or a eubacterium, such as \nEscherichia coli, Thermus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermphilus\n, or the like. In other systems, eukaryotic sources, e.g., plants, algae, protists, fungi, yeasts, animals, e.g., mammals, insects, arthropods, or the like can also be used as sources of O-tRNAs and OâRSs. Furthermore, the individual components of an O-tRNA/OâRS pair can be derived from the same organism or different organisms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe O-tRNA, OâRS or O-tRNA/OâRS pair can be selected or screened in vivo or in vitro and/or used in a cell, e.g., a eubacterial cell, to produce a polypeptide with an unnatural amino acid. The eubacterial cell used is not limited and can include, for example, \nEscherichia coli, Thermus thermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermphilus\n, or the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelector Codons\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVarious selector codons expand the genetic codon framework of protein biosynthetic machinery. For example, a selector codon can include, e.g., a unique three base codon, a nonsense codon, such as a stop codon, e.g., an amber codon (UAG), or an opal codon (UGA), an unnatural codon, at least a four base codon, a rare codon, or the like. A number of selector codons can be introduced into a desired gene, e.g., one or more, two or more, more than three, etc. Conventional site-directed mutagenesis can be used to introduce the selector codon at the site of interest in a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of interest (e.g., a self antigen of a subject, etc.). See, e.g., Sayers, et al., (1988) â5â², 3â² Exonuclease in phosphorothioate-based oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesisâ \nNucl Acid Res \n16:791-802. By using different selector codons, multiple orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pairs can be used that allow the simultaneous site-specific incorporation of multiple unnatural amino acids e.g., including at least one unnatural amino acid, using these different selector codons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnnatural amino acids can also be encoded with rare codons. For example, when the arginine concentration in an in vitro protein synthesis reaction is reduced, the rare arginine codon AGG has proven to be efficient for insertion of Ala by a synthetic tRNA acylated with alanine. See, e.g., Ma, et al., (1993) âIn vitro protein engineering using synthetic tRNA\nAla \nwith different anticodonsâ \nBiochemistry \n32:7939-7945. In such case, the synthetic tRNA competes with the naturally occurring tRNA\nArg\n, which exists as a minor species in \nEscherichia coli\n. In addition, some organisms do not use all triplet codons. An unassigned codon AGA in \nMicrococcus luteus \nhas been utilized for insertion of amino acids in an in vitro transcription/translation extract. See, e.g., Kowal and Oliver, (1997) âExploiting unassigned codons in \nMicrococcus luteus \nfor tRNA-based amino acid mutagenesisâ \nNucl Acid Res \n25:4685-4689.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelector codons can also comprise extended codons, e.g., four or more base codons, such as, four, five, six or more base codons. Examples of four base codons include, e.g., AGGA, CUAG, UAGA, CCCU, and the like. Examples of five base codons include, e.g., AGGAC, CCCCU, CCCUC, CUAGA, CUACU, UAGGC and the like. Particular methods of incorporating unnatural amino acids into proteins, e.g., unnatural immunogens such as any of the unnatural TNFÎ±s described below, or, indeed, any target moiety of interest, can include using extended codons based on frameshift suppression. Four or more base codons can insert, e.g., one or multiple unnatural amino acids, into the same protein. In other instances, the anticodon loops can decode, e.g., at least a four-base codon, at least a five-base codon, or at least a six-base codon or more. Since there are 256 possible four-base codons, multiple unnatural amino acids can be encoded in the same cell using a four or more base codon. See also, Anderson, et al., (2002) âExploring the Limits of Codon and Anticodon Sizeâ \nChemistry and Biology \n9:237-244; Magliery, et al., (2001) âExpanding the Genetic Code: Selection of Efficient Suppressors of Four-base Codons and Identification of âShiftyâ Four-base Codons with a Library Approach in \nEscherichia coliâ J Mol Biol \n307:755-769; Ma, et al., (1993) âIn vitro protein engineering using synthetic tRNA\nAla \nwith different anticodonsâ \nBiochemistry \n32:7939; Hohsaka, et al., (1999) âEfficient Incorporation of Normatural Amino Acids with Large Aromatic Groups into Streptavidin in In Vitro Protein Synthesizing Systemsâ \nJ Am Chem Soc \n121:34-40; and Moore, et al., (2000) âQuadruplet Codons: Implications for Code Expansion and the Specification of Translation Step Sizeâ \nJ Mol Biol \n298:195-209. Four base codons have been used as selector codons in a variety of orthogonal systems. See, e.g., WO 2005/019415; WO 2005/007870; and WO 2005/07624. See also, Wang and Schultz, (2005) âExpanding the Genetic Codeâ \nAngewandte Chemie Int Ed \n44:34-66.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor a given system, a selector codon can also include one of the natural three base codons, where the endogenous system does not use (or rarely uses) the natural base codon. For example, such can include a system that is lacking a tRNA that recognizes the natural three base codon, and/or a system where the three base codon is a rare codon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelector codons optionally include unnatural base pairs. Descriptions of unnatural base pairs which can be adapted for use with the methods and compositions herein include, e.g., Hirao, et al., (2002) âAn unnatural base pair for incorporating amino acid analogues into proteinâ \nNature Biotechnology \n20:177-182. See also, Wu, et al., (2002) âEnzymatic Phosphorylation of Unnatural Nucleosidesâ \nJ Am Chem Soc \n124:14626-14630.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs stated above, in different embodiments of the invention, unnatural immunogens (that can be used either to produce an immune response in a subject or to produce cross-reactive antibodies that, in turn, can be administered to a subject) can be constructed in various fashions. For example, the unnatural immunogens can typically be constructed via direct incorporation methods such as an orthogonal translation system or an in vitro translation system or through solid-phase synthesis. However, indirect incorporations such as chemical modification and post-translational modification can done when in conjunction with (or in addition to) orthogonal translation system methods or in vitro translation system methods or as further modification to amino acids added through orthogonal or in vitro translation systems (or to natural amino acids in such already constructed molecules). It will be appreciated that various embodiments of the invention can include unnatural immunogens constructed through a number of available methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-Orthogonal Methods for the Incorporation of Unnatural Amino Acids into Immunogens\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther to the above, various non-orthogonal strategies can be employed to introduce unnatural amino acids into moieties herein (or to modify unnatural amino acids incorporated into target moieties (e.g., disease related moieties) through orthogonal methods) to produce unnatural immunogens (e.g., in combination with the orthogonal methods above). It will be appreciated that in typical embodiments herein, an unnatural amino acid is incorporated into an immunogen during construction of the immunogen (e.g., when the immunogen is being translated, created/synthesized, etc.) and is not added through later chemical modification or post-translational modification. Thus, in some embodiments, derivatization of amino acids with reactive side-chains such as Lys, Cys and Tyr, e.g., the conversion of lysine to N\n2\n-acetyl-lysine, can be used in conjunction with and/or in addition to orthogonal methods or other direct incorporation methods. Chemical synthesis can also provide a method to incorporate unnatural amino acids. See, e.g., Dawson, et al., \nAnnu. Rev. Biochem., \n69:923 (2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another example, a general in vitro biosynthetic method in which a suppressor tRNA chemically acylated with the desired unnatural amino acid is added to an in vitro extract capable of supporting protein biosynthesis, as has been used to site-specifically incorporate over 100 unnatural amino acids into a variety of proteins of virtually any size can be used herein to create unnatural immunogens. See, e.g., Cornish, et al., \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., \n1995, 34:621 (1995); Noren, et al., \nScience \n244 182-188 (1989); and, Bain, et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n111 8013-8014 (1989).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn in vivo method, termed selective pressure incorporation, can also be used to exploit the promiscuity of wild-type synthetases and thus create unnatural immunogens herein. See, e.g., Budisa, et al., \nFASEB J., \n13:41 (1999). In such an auxotrophic strain, the relevant metabolic pathway supplying the cell with a particular natural amino acid is switched off, and the strain is grown in minimal media containing limited concentrations of the natural amino acid while transcription of the target gene is repressed. At the onset of a stationary growth phase, the natural amino acid is depleted and replaced with the unnatural amino acid analog. Induction of expression of the recombinant protein results in the accumulation of a protein containing the unnatural analog. See, e.g., Minks, et al., \nAnal. Biochem., \n284:29 (2000); Duewel, et al., \nBiochemistry, \n36:3404 (1997); and Tang, et al., \nAngew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., \n40:1494 (2001). For additional examples, see, e.g., Hendrickson, et al., \nEMBO J., \n9:1665 (1990); Boles, et al., \nNat. Struct. Biol., \n1:283 (1994); Budisa, et al., \nEur. J. Biochem., \n230:788 (1995); Budisa, et al., \nJ. Mol. Biol., \n270:616 (1997); vanHest et al., \nFEBS Lett., \n428:68 (1998); van Hest, et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc., \n122:1282 (2000); and, Kiick et al., \nTetrahedron, \n56:9487 (2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nYet another optional/additional strategy to incorporate unnatural amino acids into immunogens herein is to modify synthetases that have proofreading mechanisms. These synthetases cannot discriminate, and therefore charge tRNAs with amino acids that are structurally similar to the cognate natural amino acids with which the tRNAs are ordinarily charged. This error is corrected at a separate site of the synthetase, which deacylates the mischarged amino acid from the tRNA to maintain the fidelity of protein translation. If the proofreading activity of the synthetase is disabled, tRNAs charged with structural analogs of the amino acids with which they are normally charged can escape the editing function and incorporate the structural amino acid analog into a growing polypeptide chain. See, Doring, et al., \nScience, \n292:501 (2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid-phase synthesis and semisynthetic methods can also be used for the synthesis of immunogens containing unnatural amino acids herein. For example, see the following publications and references cited within: Crick, et al., \nNature, \n1227-1232 (1961); Hofmann, et al., \nJ. Am. Chem, \n5914-5919 (1966); Kaiser, et al., \nAcc Chem Res, \n47-54 (1989); Nakatsuka, et al., \nJ Am Chem Soc, \n3808-3810 (1987); Schnolzer, et al., \nScience, \n221-225 (1992); Chaiken, et al., \nCRC Crit. Rev Biochem, \n255-301 (1981); Offord, \nProtein Eng., \n151-157 (1987); and, Jackson, et al., \nScience, \n243 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChemical modification can be used in the various embodiments herein to introduce a variety of unnatural side chains, including cofactors, spin labels and oligonucleotides into unnatural immunogens of the invention. Again, chemical modification along with other post-translational modifications are typically used, if at all, as an adjuct to the direct incorporation methods such as orthogonal translation. Thus, chemical modification can optionally be used in combination with the orthogonal or other methods above such as to modify unnatural amino acids incorporated through orthogonal methods. See, e.g., Corey, et al., \nScience, \n1401-1403 (1987); Kaiser, et al., \nRev Biochem, \n565-595 (1985); Kaiser, et al., \nScience, \n505-511 (1984); Neet, et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n6392-6401 (1968); Polgar, et al., \nJ. Am. Chem Soc, \n3153-3154 (1966); and, Pollack, et al., \nScience, \n1038-1040 (1988).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, biosynthetic methods that employ chemically modified aminoacyl-tRNAs as have been used to incorporate several biophysical probes into proteins synthesized in vitro can be used herein to create unnatural immunogens. See the following publications and their cited references: Brunner, J., \nAnnu. Rev Biochem, \n483-514 (1993); and, Krieg, et al., \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci, \n8604-8608 (1986).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnnatural amino acids can also be site-specifically incorporated into unnatural immunogens of the invention by the addition of chemically aminoacylated suppressor tRNAs to protein synthesis reactions programmed with a gene containing a desired amber nonsense mutation. Using these approaches, one can substitute a number of the common twenty amino acids with close structural homologues, e.g., fluorophenylalanine for phenylalanine, using strains auxotropic for a particular amino acid. See, e.g., Noren, et al., \nScience, \n244:182-188 (1989); Nowak, et al., \nScience \n268:439-42 (1995); Bain, et al., \nJ. Am. Chem Soc, \n111:8013-8014 (1989); Budisa et al., \nFASEB J., \n13:41-51 (1999); Ellman et al., \nMethods in Enz., \n301-336 (1992); and, Mendel, et al., \nAnnu Rev Biophys. Biomol Struct., \n24, 435-62 (1995).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicroinjection techniques can also be used to incorporate unnatural amino acids into unnatural immunogens of the invention. See, e.g., Nowak, et al., \nScience, \n268:439 (1995); and Dougherty, \nCurr. Opin. Chem. Biol., \n4:645 (2000). See also, e.g., Turcatti, et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem., \n271:19991 (1996); Gallivan, et al., \nChem. Biol., \n4:739 (1997); Miller, et al., \nNeuron, \n20:619 (1998); England, et al., \nCell, \n96:89 (1999); and, Lu, et al., \nNat. Neurosci., \n4:239 (2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid phase peptide synthesis is another method that is widely used to chemically synthesize peptides and small proteins that comprise unnatural amino acids (see, e.g., Merrifield (1963) âSolid Phase Peptide synthesis. I. The synthesis of a tetrapeptide.â \nJACS \n85:2149-2154) and which can be adapted to produce unnatural immunogens of the invention. This technique typically comprises two stages: The first stage SPPS can include the assembly of a peptide chain using protected amino acid derivatives on a polymeric support via repeated cycles of coupling-deprotection. The free N-terminal amine of a solid-phase attached peptide can then be coupled to a single N-protected amino acid unit. This unit is then deprotected, revealing a new N-terminal amine to which a further amino acid may be attached. In the second stage of SPPS, the peptide is cleaved from the support and side-chain protecting groups are removed to produce the peptide, e.g., a peptide comprising one or more unnatural amino acids. There are two major used forms of solid phase peptide synthesis: Fmoc (Carpino, et al. (1972) â9-Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl amino-protecting group.â\nJ Org Chem \n37:3404-3409), in which a base labile alpha-amino protecting group is used, and t-Boc, in which an acid labile protecting group is used. Each method involves different resins and amino acid side-chain protection and consequent cleavage/deprotection steps.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein semi-synthesis can also be used to incorporate an unnatural amino acid into a protein to produce an unnatural immunogen herein. Protein semisynthesis often uses a split intein, a section of a protein that can excise itself and reattach the remaining portions, e.g., the exteins, to give a newly active protein called the splicing product. For example, one protein domain that does not comprise an unnatural amino acid can be used with a second protein domain that does comprise an unnatural amino acid, thus producing an unnatural immunogen. This strategy can be of beneficial use to produce unnatural immunogens that are difficult to express in in vivo protein expression systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of chemical ligation techniques can also be used to incorporate an unnatural amino acid into a protein herein, e.g., during protein semi synthesis, thus producing an unnatural immunogen. For example, in a native chemical ligation (NCL) reaction, a peptide comprising an N-terminal cysteine reacts with, e.g., an unnatural amino acid comprising an Î±-thioester group, e.g. a C-terminal thioester, in the presence of an exogenous thiol catalyst to yield a native peptide bond at the site of ligation (Dawson, et al. (1994) âSynthesis of Proteins by Native Chemical Ligationâ \nScience \n266:776-779). Expressed protein ligation (EPL) is a protein engineering approach that allows recombinant and synthetic polypeptides to be chemoselectively and regioselectively joined together. This approach makes the primary structure of most proteins accessible to the tools of synthetic organic chemistry, enabling the addition of any of a variety of unnatural amino acids to be incorporated into a protein to produce an unnatural immunogen. Further details regarding these and other protein chemical ligation techniques can be found in, e.g., Howl, ed. \nPeptide Synthesis and Its Applications\n, Humana Press: Totowa N.J., 2005 and others.\n\n\n \nAdditional Details Regarding Techniques\n\n\n \n \n \nAdditional useful references for producing RS and tRNA mutations, as well as a variety of recombinant and in vitro nucleic acid manipulation methods (including cloning, expression, PCR, and the like) include Berger and Kimmel, \nGuide to Molecular Cloning Techniques, Methods in Enzymology volume \n152 Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, Calif.

A variety of protein isolation and detection methods are well known in the art, including, e.g., those set forth in R. Scopes, \nProtein Purification\n, Springer-Verlag, N.Y. (1982); Deutscher, \nMethods in Enzymology Vol. \n182: \nGuide to Protein Purification\n, Academic Press, Inc. N.Y.

Additional details regarding protein purification and detection methods can be found in Satinder Ahuja ed., \nHandbook of Bioseparations\n, Academic Press (2000). These available methods can be used (optionally in conjunction with other protein purification methods) to isolate and/or purify unnatural immunogens produced through various methods herein (e.g., through orthogonal translation methods) in order to, e.g., prepare immunogens to use in treatments, vaccines, or other aspects of the current invention.\n\n\n \nAntibodies and Antibody Production\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the invention comprises one or more antibody against an immunogen (i.e., an unnatural disease-related moiety that comprises one or more unnatural amino acid), which antibody can be administered to a subject. As detailed above, such an antibody is typically cross-reactive with a corresponding target moiety within the subject, or that is capable of being within the subject, which natural target moiety does not comprise an unnatural amino acid and from which the âunnaturalâ immunogen is derived or to which the immunogen corresponds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, an antibody refers to a protein consisting of one or more polypeptides substantially encoded by immunoglobulin genes or fragments of immunoglobulin genes. The recognized immunoglobulin genes include the kappa, lambda, alpha, gamma, delta, epsilon and mu constant region genes, as well as myriad immunoglobulin variable region genes. Light chains are classified as either kappa or lambda. Heavy chains are classified as gamma, mu, alpha, delta, or epsilon, which in turn define the immunoglobulin classes, IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA typical immunoglobulin (antibody) structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains, each pair having one âlightâ (about 25 kD) and one âheavyâ chain (about 50-70 kD). The N-terminus of each chain defines a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The terms âvariable light chain (VL)â and âvariable heavy chain (VH)â refer to these light and heavy chains respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the invention can exist as intact immunoglobulins or as a number of well-characterized fragments produced by digestion with various peptidases. Thus, for example, pepsin digests an antibody below the disulfide linkages in the hinge region to produce F(ab)â²2, a dimer of Fab which itself is a light chain joined to VH-CH1 by a disulfide bond. The F(ab)â²2 may be reduced under mild conditions to break the disulfide linkage in the hinge region thereby converting the (Fabâ²)\n2 \ndimer into a Fabâ² monomer. The Fabâ² monomer is essentially a Fab with part of the hinge region (see, Fundamental Immunology, W. E. Paul, ed., Raven Press, N.Y. (1999), for a more detailed description of other antibody fragments). While various antibody fragments are defined in terms of the digestion of an intact antibody, one of skill will appreciate that such Fabâ² fragments may be synthesized de novo either chemically or by utilizing recombinant DNA methodology. Thus, the term antibody, as used herein, also includes antibody fragments either produced by the modification of whole antibodies or synthesized de novo using recombinant DNA methodologies. Particular antibodies include single chain antibodies (antibodies that exist as a single polypeptide chain), or single chain Fv antibodies (sFv or scFv) in which a variable heavy and a variable light chain are joined together (directly or through a peptide linker) to form a continuous polypeptide. The single chain Fv antibody is a covalently linked VH-VL heterodimer that can be expressed from a nucleic acid including VH- and VL-encoding sequences either joined directly or joined by a peptide-encoding linker. See, Huston, et al. (1988) \nProc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, \n85:5879-5883. While the VH and VL are connected to each as a single polypeptide chain, the VH and VL domains associate non-covalently. The scFv antibodies and a number of other structures converting the naturally aggregated, but chemically separated light, and heavy polypeptide chains from an antibody V region into a molecule that folds into a three dimensional structure substantially similar to the structure of an antigen-binding site are known to those of skill in the art (see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,091,513, 5,132,405, and 4,956,778). Antibodies useful in the current invention include polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe unnatural immunogens of the invention, or their fragments, can be used to produce antibodies of the invention. Polyclonal antibodies, humanized antibodies, monoclonal antibodies, or antibody fragments can be produced using the unnatural immunogens of the invention. The antibodies can be purified by standard methods to provide antibody preparations that are substantially free of unwanted contaminants, e.g., serum proteins, that may affect their reactivity. For polyclonal antibodies, a selected mammal, (e.g., mouse, rabbit, goat, horse, etc.) can be immunized with an unnatural immunogen of the invention. Serum from the immunized animal can then be collected and treated according to procedures well known to those of skill in the art. Furthermore, polyclonal antibodies can be purified by immunoaffinity chromatography, again using procedures well known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, or additionally, monoclonal antibodies against an unnatural immunogen of the invention can be created. The making of monoclonal antibodies through hybridoma technology is well known to those of kill in the art. For example, an immortal cell line that produces an antibody of the invention can be created by cell fusion, or by other techniques, e.g., direct transformation of B lymphocytes with oncogenic DNA, transfection with Epstein-Barr virus, etc. See, e.g., Schreier, et al., Hybridoma Techniques (1980); Hammerling, et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and T-cell Hybridomas (1981); Kennett et al., Monoclonal Antibodies (1980); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,341,761; 4,399,121; 4,427,783; 4,444,887; 4,452,570; 4,466,917; 4,472,500; 4,491,632; and 4,493,890, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs those of skill in the art readily appreciate, other numerous well-known protocols exist to guide design and production of antibodies (e.g., monoclonal, polyclonal, humanized, etc.). Antibodies also can be prepared by any of a number of commercial services (e.g., Berkeley Antibody Laboratories, Bethyl Laboratories, Anawa, Eurogenetec, etc.).\n\n\n \nAnti-TNFÎ± Immunotherapy Based on an Unnatural TNFÎ± Immunogen Comprising an Antibody-Accessible P-Nitrophenylalanine\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a particular embodiment, described in further detail in the Examples below, the invention provides compositions and methods that can be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of pathologies associated with the activity of TNFÎ±.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFÎ±) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of many chronic inflammatory diseases, including Crohn's disease, endotoxic shock, cerebral malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and others. A major challenge in the treatment and/or prevention of these diseases has been the development of methods that permit the immune system to selectively overcome tolerance to endogenous TNFÎ± in order to stimulate the production of TNFÎ±-neutralizing antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNeutralizing TNFÎ± can alleviate symptoms of such diseases. For example, anti-TNFÎ± antisera have been employed in numerous experiments to determine their therapeutic potential (reviewed in Veres, et al., (2007) âInfliximab therapy for pediatric Crohn's diseaseâ \nExpert Opin Biol Ther \n7:1869-1880; Ackermann, et al. (2007) âTumor necrosis factor as a therapeutic target of rheumatologic diseaseâ \nExpert Opin Ther Targets \n8:2553-68, Knight, et al. (1993) âConstruction and initial characterization of a mouse-human chimeric anti-TNF antibodyâ \nMol Immunol \n30:1443-1453; Present, et al. (1999) âInfliximab for the Treatment of Fistulas in Patients with Crohn's Diseaseâ \nNew Engl J Med \n340:1398-1405). Soluble chimeric TNFÎ± receptors have also been studied for their efficacy in minimizing the symptoms associated with arthritis, septic shock, and Crohn's disease (Peppel, et al. (1991) âA tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-IgG heavy chain chimeric protein as a bivalent antagonist of TNF activity.â \nJ Exp Med \n174:1483-1489; Williams, et al. (1995) âSuccessful therapy of collagen-induced arthritis with TNF receptor-IgG fusion protein and combination with anti-CD4â \nImmunology \n84:433-439; Hoy, et al. (2007) âEtanercept: A Review of its Use in the Management of Ankylosing Spondylitis and Psoriatic Arthritisâ \nDrugs \n67:2609-2633; Fisher, et al. (1996) âTreatment of Septic Shock with the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor:Fc Fusion Proteinâ \nNew Eng J Med \n334:1697-1702; Korzenik (2004) âCrohn's disease: future anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies beyond infliximabâ \nGastro Clin of North Am \n33:285-301). Breaking a subject's immunological tolerance to self-TNFÎ± is one strategy by which TNFÎ±-associated diseases can be treated and/or prevented.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe challenge of breaking immunological tolerance has been attempted by a number of strategies, described and referenced elsewhere herein. Some embodiments of the present invention provide an unnatural TNFÎ±, i.e. a TNFÎ± that comprises unnatural amino acid (UAA), that, when administered to a subject, stimulates or enhances an immunological response against an endogenous TNFÎ±, e.g., a TNFÎ± that may or may not be present in the subject at serum levels and/or expression levels that represent a disease state. Also provided herein are treatments for and vaccines against disease states, e.g. those listed herein associated with the presence or level of presence of TNFÎ±, that entail administering anti-unnatural TNFÎ± antibodies, which antibodies are cross-reactive with a natural TNFÎ±, to attenuate or prevent the symptoms associated with TNFÎ±-related disease states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, elevated serum levels of TNFÎ± are associated with a variety of disease states. It will be appreciated, however, that a subject in whom the immunological response is created and/or to whom the prophylactic treatment is administered, etc may not exhibit at serum TNFÎ± levels that represent a disease state. Thus, it should be appreciated that the antibodies, and/or the unnatural immunogens of the invention can be administered both to individuals who do exhibit a TNFÎ±-associated disease as well as those who do not.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for producing an unnatural TNFÎ± comprising any unnatural amino acid, e.g., any of the unnatural TNFÎ±s described herein, are elaborated herein in UNNATURAL IMMUNOGENS and UNNATURAL IMMUNOGEN PRODUCTION and in the Examples. Although the unnatural TNFÎ±s described in the Examples below have been produced using orthogonal translation systems, it will be appreciated that unnatural TNFÎ±s can also be produced using any one or more of the non-orthogonal methods detailed herein that are not chemical modifications or post-translational modifications (e.g., selective pressure incorporation, solid-phase synthesis, protein semi-synthesis, and others).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment described herein, an unnatural TNFÎ± comprises a highly immunogenic (E. Keinan, Ed. \nCatalytic Antibodies \n(Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005) pp. 1-28), structurally conservative, antibody accessible p-nitrophenylalanine (pNO\n2\nPhe, \nFIG. 1A\n) residue at \namino acid position\n 86, e.g., pNO\n2\nPhe\n86\nTNFÎ±. In this embodiment, the substitution mutation permits the unnatural TNFÎ±, e.g., pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, to maintain a tertiary and quaternary protein structure that is substantially similar to that of the self-TNFÎ±, thus increasing the probability that neutralizing antibodies produced against the unnatural TNFÎ±, e.g., pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, can cross react with corresponding epitopes on the natural mTNFÎ±, e.g., a mouse TNFÎ±. As detailed above, the replacement of and/or addition of an unnatural amino acid can optionally not change (or not significantly change) the conformational structure of the unnatural TNFÎ± as compared to the endogenous natural TNFÎ±. Additional unnatural mTNFÎ± derivatives (e.g., of GenBank Accession No. NP\nâ\n038721) that can find use in therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatments in a mouse subject include a pNO\n2\nPhe\n11\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n19\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n21\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n42\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n49\n-mTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n104\n-mTNFÎ±, or a pNO\n2\nPhe\n113\n-mTNFÎ±. Unnatural hTNFÎ±s derivations (e.g., of GenBank Accession No. AAA61200) that can find use in therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatments in a human subject include a pNO\n2\nPhe\n11\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n19\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n21\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n42\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n49\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n87\n-hTNFÎ±, a pNO\n2\nPhe\n105\n-hTNFÎ±, or a pNO\n2\nPhe\n114\n-hTNFÎ±.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, elevated serum levels of TNFÎ± are associated with a variety of disease states. Again, it will be appreciated, however, that a subject in whom the immunological response is created and/or to whom the prophylactic treatment is administered, etc. may not exhibit at serum TNFÎ± levels that represent a disease state. Thus, it should be appreciated that the vaccines, the antibodies, and/or the unnatural immunogens of the invention can be administered both to individuals who do exhibit a TNFÎ±-associated disease as well as those who do not.\n\n\n \nAnti-RBP4 Immunotherapy Based on an Unnatural RBP Immunogen Comprising an Antibody-Accessible P-nitrophenylalanine\n\n\n \n \n \nIn embodiments described in Example 2, the methods and compositions of the invention can be beneficially used to treat and/or prevent of RBP4-associated diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRBP4, a low molecular weight serum protein, is secreted from the liver and adipose tissue and is the principal carrier of 90% of serum vitamin A. Excess levels of RBP4 contribute to such visual diseases as Matthew Wood Syndrome, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and Stargardt's disease, among other conditions. Furthermore, elevated levels of serum RBP4 are also known to contribute to the development of insulin resistance and/or diabetes. Some embodiments of the present invention provide an unnatural RBP4, i.e., an RBP4 that comprises an unnatural amino acid, that can be administered to a subject to treat and/or prevent these diseases, e.g., by stimulating an antibody, B cell, or T cell response against a corresponding natural RBP4. It will be appreciated, however, that here too, a subject in whom the immunological response is created and/or to whom the prophylactic treatment is administered, etc. may not exhibit at serum RBP4 levels that represent a disease state. Thus, it should be appreciated that the vaccines, the antibodies, and/or the unnatural immunogens of the invention can be administered both to individuals who do exhibit a RBP4-associated disease as well as those who do not.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods that can be used to produce an unnatural TNFÎ±, elaborated herein, can also be used to produce an unnatural RBP4. The unnatural RBP4 can include any unnatural amino acid described herein that is incorporated into the unnatural RBP4 in a method that is other than post-translational modification or chemical modification. Any natural RBP4 can be substituted with any unnatural amino acid to produce an unnatural RBP4. The substitution need not replace the natural amino acid with a structurally conservative unnatural amino acid. Alternatively or additionally, one or more additional unnatural amino acids can be added to an RBP4 polypeptide to produce an unnatural RBP4. The unnatural RBP4 can optionally comprise a structure that is substantially similar to the natural RBP4, thus increasing the probability that neutralizing antibodies produced against the unnatural RBP4 can cross react with corresponding epitopes on the natural RBP4. Unnatural RBP4s that can find use in therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatments in a subject include a pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4 and a pNO\n2\nPhe\n108 \nmRBP4, as well corresponding human constructs, etc.\n\n\n \nAdministration and Formulation\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibody and/or Immunogen Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn order to produce or enhance an immunological response against a target moiety, e.g., a TNFÎ±, or any other of the myriad possible targets noted herein, the treatment methods of the invention can employ an antibody against an immunogen, e.g., a derivative of the target moiety that comprises one or more unnatural amino acids, and/or employ the immunogen itself, e.g., an unnatural TNFÎ±. Typically, such antibodies and/or immunogens are present in combination with a physiologically acceptable adjuvant, excipient, and/or stabilizer that is non-toxic to recipients (e.g., subjects) at the dosages employed. It will be appreciated, however, that the current invention is not necessarily limited by the specific formulations of antibody and/or immunogen preparations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of antibodies and/or immunogens (i.e., derivatives of target moieties that comprise one or more unnatural amino acids) can include a physiologically acceptable adjuvant, excipient, and/or stabilizer. Excipients known in the art include, for example, vegetable and animal oils and fats. Stabilizing agents, wetting and emulsifying agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers for maintaining a desirable pH, and/or skin penetration enhancers can be used as auxiliary (i.e., excipient) agents in the various formulations. Methods for preparing various conventional dosage forms are known or will be apparent to those skilled in the art; for example, see, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (21\nst \nEdition, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005). Formulation can also include one or more adjuvants such as alum, Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA), Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), squalene, virosomes, MSP1, QS21, etc. Furthermore, the formulation can also comprise wherein the immunogen is fused to carriers such as a polypeptide carrier, a carbohydrate carrier (e.g., one or more units of a monosaccharide such as mannose, one or more units of mucin, etc.), keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), ovalbumin, hen egg albumin, tetanus toxin or diphtheria toxin, etc. Those of skill in the art will be familiar with a number of adjuvants, carriers, excipients, stabilizers, etc., that can optionally be used with the current invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, examples of common excipients that can be used for either antibody and/or immunogen formulations include buffers (such as phosphate buffer, citrate buffer, and buffers made from other organic acids), antioxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid), low-molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptides, additional proteins (such as serum albumin, gelatin, and an immunoglobulin), hydrophilic polymers (such as polyvinylpyrrolidone), amino acids (such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine, and lysine), monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates (including glucose, mannose, and dextrins), chelating agents (e.g., ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA]), sugar alcohols (such as mannitol and sorbitol), salt-forming counter ions (e.g., sodium), and/or anionic surfactants (such as Tweenâ¢, Pluronicsâ¢, and PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated that particular adjuvants, excipients, or stabilizers and formulations used can vary depending upon, e.g., whether the formulation comprises an antibody or an unnatural immunogen of the invention, the specific route of administration, other drugs given, dosage used, etc. For example, in intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous administration, the antibody or immunogen can be incorporated into a pharmaceutically acceptable and injectable excipient. Typically, the excipient is one such as sterile water, aqueous saline solution, aqueous buffered saline solution, aqueous dextrose solution, aqueous glycerol solution, ethanol, or combinations thereof. The preparation of such solutions ensuring sterility, proper pH, isotonicity, and stability is achieved according to protocols established in the art for administration of antibodies or antigenic proteins. Generally, an excipient is selected to minimize allergic and other undesirable effects, and to suit the particular route of administration, e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the formulations can be prepared for oral administration, e.g., incorporated into a food or drink, formulated into a chewable or swallowable tablet or capsule, etc. Such formulations, thus, allow rapid uptake in the bloodstream and distribution to various compartments of the body. Typically for oral administration, excipients can include pharmaceutical grades of lactose, mannitol, starch, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, talcum, cellulose, glucose, gelatin, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like. When the composition is employed in the form of solid preparations for oral administration, the preparations may be tablets, granules, powders, capsules, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the invention utilizes sustained-release pharmaceutical formulations to deliver the antibody and/or unnatural immunogen. An exemplary sustained-release formulation comprises a semipermeable matrix of a solid hydrophobic polymer to which the antibodies and/or unnatural immunogens of the invention are attached or in which such are encapsulated. Examples of suitable polymers include a polyester, a hydrogel, a polylactide, a copolymer of L-glutamic acid and T-ethyl-L-glutamase, non-degradable ethylene-vinylacetate, a degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer, and poly-D-(â)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. Such matrices can be in the form of shaped articles, such as films, or microcapsules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the various methods herein, the immunogens, e.g., any of the unnatural TNFÎ±s or any other immunogens described herein, or anti-immunogen antibodies that cross-react with target moieties can also be prepared in formulations to be administered to a subject transdermally. For transdermal administration, the antibody and/or unnatural immunogen can be incorporated into a lipophilic carrier and formulated as a topical cream or ointment or in an adhesive patch. Methods for preparing various conventional dosage forms are known or will be apparent to those skilled in the art; for example, see, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (21\nst \nEdition, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005). Thus, a sustained-release formulation can include liposomally entrapped active agents. Liposomes are small vesicles composed of various types of lipids, phospholipids, and/or surfactants. These components are typically arranged in a bilayer formation, similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Liposomes containing antibodies/unnatural immunogens can be prepared by known methods, such as, for example, those described in Epstein, et al. (1985) \nPNAS USA \n82:3688-92, and Hwang, et al., (1980) \nPNAS USA, \n77:4030-34. Useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse-phase evaporation method, using a lipid formulation including, for example, phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and PEG-derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE). If desired, liposomes can be extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes of a particular diameter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the antibodies and/or unnatural immunogens of the invention, such as those described throughout, can be prepared into formulations for mucosal administration. Mucosal administration includes such routes as buccal, endotracheal, inhalation, nasal, pharyngeal, rectal, sublingual, vaginal, etc. For administration through the mucosal membranes, the antibodies and/or unnatural immunogens can be formulated as an emulsion, gum, lozenge, spray, tablet or the like. Nasal administration can be conducted through a powder or spray formulation. For rectal and vaginal administration the formulations can comprise a cream, douche, enema or suppository, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the antibody and/or unnatural immunogens can be prepared into formulations for ocular administration by incorporating them into a solution or suspension adapted for ocular application, e.g., drops or sprays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations utilized herein can also include the antibodies and/or unnatural immunogens adsorbed onto a membrane, such as a silastic membrane, which can be implanted, as described in International Publication No. WO 91/04014.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical formulations utilized by the invention can be stored in any standard form, including, e.g., an aqueous solution or a lyophilized cake. Such formulations are typically sterile when administered to subjects. Sterilization of an aqueous solution is readily accomplished by filtration through a sterile filtration membrane. If the formulation is stored in lyophilized form, the formulation can be filtered before or after lyophilization and reconstitution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of Antibodies and/or Unnatural Immunogens\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described herein, the present invention concerns compositions and methods to produce or enhance an immunological response in a subject against a target moiety, e.g., a self moiety such as a TNFÎ±, through administration of antibodies against an unnatural target moiety (an unnatural immunogen), which antibody is cross reactive with the target moiety and/or through administration of the unnatural target moiety itself. Such target moieties can include, for example, any of the unnatural TNFÎ±s described in the Examples below as well as myriad other molecules, e.g., as described herein. Typically, the specific formulation is given either alone or in combination (e.g., co-administered) with other treatments or medications to therapeutically and/or prophylactically treat one or more of a number of medical conditions/disease states. It will be appreciated that depending upon whether an antibody against the unnatural immunogen is administered, whether an unnatural immunogen is administered, the specific formulation of the antibody and/or unnatural immunogen that is administered, etc., the administration/treatment regime can vary. Thus, in some embodiments, administration of an antibody of the invention is different (e.g., in dosage, time-course, etc.) than administration of an unnatural immunogen of the invention. It will also be appreciated that recitation of particular formulations and/or administration regimes herein should not necessarily be taken as limiting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose of skill in the art will be familiar with numerous medical/physiological/psychological tests and measurements to help in selection of subjects that are to be administered the compositions and/or to whom the methods of the invention are to be performed. For example detection of viral or bacterial infection or the like (e.g., HIV infection) is well known and widely practiced by those of skill in the art. Similarly, numerous diagnostic tests (e.g., based on symptoms and/or presence of specific infectious agents, etc.) are available for other medical disorders, e.g., cancer, autoimmune disorders (e.g., SLE), etc. Such determination can be used to help select subjects herein to which the unnatural immunogens and/or antibodies against such are to be administered. Furthermore, in some instances, subjects are optionally chosen based on their familial history, environmental exposure, etc. For example, subjects can be chosen based on a family history or family predisposition to a disease state (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, etc.). Also, subjects can optionally be chosen based on exposure or potential/risk of exposure to an infectious agent or other disease causative agent (e.g., exposure or possible exposure of sex workers to HIV, exposure or possible exposure of healthcare workers to hepatitis, exposure of workers to silica compounds possibly leading to silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis, etc.). Those of skill in the art will be familiar with additional examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody Administration\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the invention have therapeutic and/or prophylactic utility. Thus, in various embodiments, they can be used to, e.g., produce or enhance an immunological response against one or more specific target moieties. Therefore, the invention provides methods for treating one or more disease state (e.g., cancer, an autoimmune condition, a pathogenic infection, etc.) related to or associated with such target moiety by using antibodies of the invention. As explained throughout, antibodies of the invention can be used to treat and/or prevent numerous diseases and/or disorders. For example, diseases/disorders such as endotoxic shock, cerebral malaria, an autoimmune disorder, multiple organ failure, multiple sclerosis, cardiac dysfunction, atherosclerosis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, insulin resistance, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, cachexia, septic shock, AIDS, graft-versus-host disease, bactericidal granulomas, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and/or silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis, as well as numerous others, can be treated through use of the current invention. As explained above, the antibodies of the invention are specific for an unnatural immunogen (an unnatural disease-related moiety, such as an unnatural TNFÎ±), but are cross-reactive with the corresponding target moiety that does not comprise an unnatural amino acid (such as a natural TNFÎ±). As will be appreciated, the various methods of the invention comprising antibody administration can optionally be used in combination with other therapeutic/prophylactic treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, antibiotic and/or antiviral treatment, surgery, etc.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the invention can be administered to a subject through injection (e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular injection), or by other methods such as infusion. The antibodies can also be administered via intratumoral, peritumoral, intralesional, or perilesional routes and therefore exert local as well as systemic effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEffective dosages, time courses, schedules, etc., for administering antibodies of the invention can be determined empirically. Those of skill in the art will be familiar with such tailoring of antibody treatment for numerous medical conditions. The parameters (e.g., dosage, time course, etc.) involved in antibody treatment of a subject can vary depending on, e.g., the individual subject to receive the antibodies (e.g., the subject's species, disease state, overall physical condition, etc.), the route of administration, the particular type of antibody used and other drugs being administered whether the treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic, etc. Further guidance in creating antibody treatment programs can be found throughout the literature, e.g., \nHandbook of Monoclonal Antibodies\n, Ferrone, et al., eds., Noges Publications, Park Ridge, N.J., (1985); Antibodies in Diagnosis and Therapy: Technologies Mechanisms and Clinical Data, CRC, 1999.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnnatural Immunogen Administration\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the unnatural immunogens of the invention (i.e., versions of a target moiety which have one or more unnatural amino acid, including, but not limited to, any of the unnatural TNFÎ±s or RBP4s described hereinbelow) can be administered to a subject in order for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment. As detailed herein, administration of such unnatural immunogens produces an immunological response in the subject, an antibody response against the unnatural immunogen. Furthermore, however, the antibodies produced by the subject against the unnatural immunogen, are preferably cross-reactive against a natural version of the target moiety (which corresponds to the unnatural immunogen) that is within the subject or that is capable of being in the subject (i.e., a disease-related moiety whether arising from pathogenic infection, cancer, an autoimmune condition, etc., but which does not comprise an unnatural amino acid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the methods herein, the unnatural immunogens, such as unnatural TNFÎ±s or any of the other myriad possible targets listed herein, can be administered in any of the commonly accepted manners for administration of pharmaceutical compositions. Again, those of skill in the art will be quite familiar with such routes and delivery protocols. For example, routes of administration for unnatural immunogens can include, but are not limited to: oral, intracerebral, intrathecal, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, transdermal, mucosal (e.g., via suppository or intranasal or transbuccal administration) or ocular administration, etc. Thus, depending upon the route of administration, the unnatural immunogens can be provided in various dosage forms, such as, for example, tablets, capsules, powders, controlled-release formulations, suspensions, emulsions, suppositories, creams, ointments, lotions, or aerosols. See above. Particular embodiments utilize dosage forms suitable for simple administration of precise dosages.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDelivery can contain up to a full daily dose, or the unnatural immunogen can be delivered over an extended period, e.g., 3-10 days, in an amount effective to produce at least an average daily dose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhere an antibody response (typically against the corresponding natural target moiety that does not comprise an unnatural amino acid) in a subject is weak or lower than desired, further administration of the unnatural immunogen can be performed (e.g., until the titer of the desired antibody increases sufficiently). Furthermore, after immunization with the unnatural immunogen, serum samples can be taken from the subject to test for production of the desired antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCo-Administration of Antibodies and/or Unnatural Immunogens and Other Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf desired, administration of antibodies and/or unnatural immunogens of the invention can be performed in conjunction with administration of one or more other drug or treatment. The antibodies/unnatural immunogens can be administered in the same formulation as another drug, or can be administered separately (e.g., at separate times, in different formulations, according to different schedules, according to different criteria, etc.). Furthermore, in various embodiments, multiple antibody types and/or multiple unnatural immunogens can be administered to a subject, again, either concurrently or sequentially, optionally along with other drugs (or treatments).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies and/or unnatural immunogens of the invention can also be administered, either concurrently or sequentially, with various treatments such as surgery, radiation treatment, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe additional drugs/treatments with which the antibodies and/or unnatural immunogens of the invention can be co-administered optionally are to treat the same particular aspect of the medical condition as the antibodies/unnatural immunogens of the invention (e.g., decrease of a particular target moiety within the subject) or can be to treat other or related (or even unrelated) medical conditions in the subject. Thus, the co-administered drugs/treatments can be to treat other aspects of an underlying medical condition (disease state). For example, in the various treatments, the antibodies and/or unnatural immunogens of the invention are optionally administered along with any of a number of common treatments, such as aspirin, salisylates, ibuprofen, naproxen, sulindac (e.g., Clinorilâ¢), oxaprozin and tolmetin for fever, joint pain and inflammation, etc. In some embodiments, antimalarial drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine and quinacrine can be indicated for treatment of malaria or for various skin abnormalities involved in other conditions (e.g., SLE). Corticosteroids, typically prednisone, can be administered for organ inflammation, etc. Some androgenic compounds, e.g., danazol (e.g., Danocrineâ¢) can be used in controlling immune thrombocytopenia and severe hemolytic anemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the antibodies/unnatural immunogens of the invention can also be administered along with drugs that are effective for secondary conditions arising from the underlying medical condition or even arising from the treatment for the underlying medical condition. For example, in some embodiments, the treatments of the invention can be administered along with calcitonin to help treat bone density loss arising from treatment of various ancillary conditions that may arise from use of prednisone, methotrexate, immunosuppressants, anti-inflammatories, etc., in a treatment program.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTime-Course and Adjustment of Dosage of Antibodies and/or Unnatural Immunogens\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs stated above, the range of antibody/unnatural immunogen dosages and dose rates effective for achieving the desired outcome in a subject (and, thus, optionally an effective treatment of a medical condition/disease state) can be determined in accordance with standard industry practices. These ranges can be expected to differ depending upon whether the desired response is the prophylactic, therapeutic or curative treatment of the medical condition (e.g., cancer, SLE, Sjogren's syndrome, bacterial infection, viral infection, scleroderma, allergic diseases, HIV/AIDS, etc.), the type or severity of symptoms, other medications being administered, the age, gender, medical history and other individual parameters of the subject being treated, etc. In some embodiments, the dosages can be determined based upon changes produced in particular levels of a target moiety, as measured, e.g., in changes as measured by ELISA or the like. To determine such levels in a subject, typical embodiments herein can measure the levels of the moiety in any one or more of a biological tissue, peripheral blood, serum, plasma, urine, vaginal fluid, semen, saliva, peritoneal fluid, lymphatic fluid, aqueous or vitreous humor, tears, pulmonary effusion or serosal fluid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose skilled in the art will be familiar with individual tailoring of treatment regimes to effect the desired outcome in various subjects. Thus, in many embodiments, while a particular dosage of antibody and/or unnatural immunogen is used as either a starting point or a target level, such dosage is optionally adjusted based on specific factors of the subject receiving treatment. For example, the dosage can be increased if the desired level of target moiety is not reached. Alternately or additionally, if/when the desired level is achieved, the dosage can be tapered down to find the lowest level that will achieve stability at the desired level.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibody/unnatural immunogen dosage can also be adjusted based upon symptoms of the underlying medical condition being treated. For example, if the subject is being treated for a particular medical condition, then symptoms of that particular condition are optionally used as guidelines or indicators for dosages (amounts and time courses). Thus, in some embodiments, evaluations of the seventy of the condition, e.g., as measured by time intervals between outbursts of symptoms, etc., can be used as indirect measurement of progress of treatment, and, thus, administration can be tailored accordingly. Those of skill in the art will be aware of other tests/diagnostic scales capable of use to monitor symptoms in medical conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubjects to which Antibodies and/or Unnatural Immunogens Can Be Administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA variety of animals can benefit from vaccines, therapeutic treatments, and/or prohyllactic treatments provided by the invention, as well. Such animals include, but are not limited to, domestic livestock, such as cows, pigs, goats, sheep, chickens, and/or other common farm animals. Common household pets, e.g., cats, dogs, parrots, parakeets, etc., can also benefit from being administered a cross-reactive antibody against an unnatural immunogen and/or the immunogen itself.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther details regarding the use of animal models and animal subjects in biomedical testing and veterinary treatment are elaborated in, e.g., Ng, Chow, and Ogden, eds. \nUsing Animal Models in Biomedical Research: A Primer for the Investigator\n. First Edition. Singapore: World Scientific Publishing Company, 2008; Conn, ed. \nSourcebook of Models for Biomedical Research\n. Totowa, N.J.: Springer, 2008; Woodhead, ed. \nNonmammalian Animal Models for Biomedical Research \n(\nVol \n1). New York: Academic Press, 1990.

USA: Merck, 2005; and references cited therein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies and/or unnatural immunogens provided by the invention can be administered not only to treat a disease state in a subject, e.g., a human, but also to perform treatment efficacy tests, as well as metabolic tests, toxicology tests, and specific tests to determine the effects of the antibodies and/or unnatural immunogens on reproductive function or embryonic toxicity, or to determine their carcinogenic potential. Performing such observational studies can entail administering the antibodies and/or unnatural immunogens of the invention to a variety of animal subjects. Those of skill in the art will be quite familiar with numerous medical tests and measurements to help in selection of animal subjects that are to be administered the compositions and/or to whom the methods of the invention are to be performed. Such animal subjects include, but are not limited to, e.g., mammals such as goats sheep, camels, cows, pigs, rabbits, horses, hamsters, non-human primates (monkeys, including cynomologous monkeys, baboons, Old World Monkeys, and chimpanzees), guinea pigs, rats, mice, and/or cats. Birds such as, e.g., domestic fowl (chickens, turkeys), cockatiels, psittacine birds, and cage and/or aviary birds, as well as bird embryos, can also be used in the research and development, production, quality control, or safety testing of antibodies and/or unnatural immunogens provided by the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFish, such as zebrafish, platyfish, and swordtails; amphibians, including, e.g., frogs and salamanders; and reptiles (snakes, lizards, and turtles) can also be used in a wide variety of tests to determine the safety, effective dose, and/or toxicology of the compositions described herein and/or the methods of their administration. See, e.g., Barry, et al. (2002) âInformation Resources for Reptiles, Amphibians, Fish, and Cephalopods Used in Biomedical Research.â United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Library Animal Welfare Information Center, and the references cited therein.\n\n\n \nKits and Articles of Manufacture\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the invention provides a kit or an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the methods and compositions described herein. Such kits can optionally comprise one or more containers, labels, and instructions, as well components for construction of antibodies and/or unnatural immunogens and/or actual antibodies and/or unnatural immunogens (e.g., unnatural TNFÎ±s or any of the other myriad examples herein).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kits can also optionally comprise one or more antibody (i.e., an antibody against an unnatural immunogen, which antibody is cross-reactive against a natural target moiety within a subject) and/or one or more unnatural immunogen as well as optionally other components (e.g., various antibiotics, various antifungal agents, etc.). Such unnatural immunogens can include, but are not limited to, any one or more of the unnatural TNFÎ±s provided by the invention. The kits can optionally include tubes or other containers (e.g., of glass, plastic, nylon, cotton, polyester, metal, etc.) to store the components or in which to mix/prepare the components as well as one or more devices with which to administer such to a subject (e.g., a human in need of treatment, etc.). In some embodiments, the device with which to administer the components to the subject comprises the container in which the components are stored and/or mixed/prepared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kits can also optionally include additional components in addition to the antibody/unnatural immunogen components of the invention, e.g., buffers, diluents, filters, dressings, bandages, applicators, gauze, barriers, semi-permeable barriers, tongue depressors, needles, and syringes, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn many embodiments, the kits comprise instructions (e.g., typically written instructions) relating to the use of the kit to treat a subject for one or more medical condition/disease state). In some embodiments, the kits comprise a URL address or phone number or the like for users to contact for instructions or further instructions. The kits can be unit doses, bulk packages (e.g., multi-dose packages), or sub-unit doses.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following examples are offered to illustrate, but not to limit the claimed invention. It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nBreaking Immunological Tolerance with a Genetically Encoded Unnatural Amino Acid\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability to selectively induce a strong immune response against self-proteins, or increase the immunogenicity of specific epitopes in foreign antigens, would have a significant impact on the production of vaccines for cancer, protein-misfolding diseases, and infectious diseases. Here, we show that site-specific incorporation of an immunogenic unnatural amino acid into a protein of interest produces high-titer antibodies that cross-react with WT protein. Specifically, mutation of a single tyrosine residue (Tyr\n86\n) of murine tumor necrosis factor-Î± (mTNFÎ±) to p-nitrophenylalanine (pNO\n2\nPhe) induced a high-titer antibody response in mice, whereas no significant antibody response was observed for a Tyr\n86\nâPhe mutant. The antibodies generated against the pNO\n2\nPhe are highly cross-reactive with native mTNFÎ± and protect mice against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced death. This approach may provide a general method for inducing an antibody response to specific epitopes of self- and foreign antigens that lead to a neutralizing immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA major challenge in modern vaccinology is the development of robust methods to selectively induce a strong immune response against self-proteins or to increase the immunogenicity of specific epitopes in foreign antigens that can elicit neutralizing antibodies but that are not immunodominant. A number of strategies are being pursued to address this challenge including the development of improved adjuvants, the introduction of foreign helper peptides into chimeric antigens, and the use of DNA vaccines (Dalum, et al. (1999) âTherapeutic antibodies elicited by immunization against TNF-alpha.â \nNat Biotechnol \n17: 666-669; Makela, et al. (2002) âEvolution of conjugate vaccines.â \nExpert Rev Vaccines \n1: 399-410; Restifo, et al. (1996) âThe new vaccines: building viruses that elicit anti-tumor immunity.â Curr Opin Immunol, 8: 658-663; Baldridge, et al., \nVaccine Adjuvants: Immunological and Clinical Principles\n. C. J. Hackett, Ham, D. A., Jr., Ed. (Humana Press, Totowa, N.J., 2006), pp 235-255). Interestingly, almost 50 years ago, Weigle (Weigle (1965) âThe induction of autoimmunity on rabbits following injections of heterologous or altered homologous thyroglobulin.â \nJ Exp Med \n121: 289-308) showed that rabbits immunized with a rabbit thyroglobulin that had been nonspecifically labeled with a diazonium derivative produced cross-reactive antibodies to native thyroglobulin. Although these early experiments produced a highly heterogeneous antigen, one interpretation is that chemical modification results in immunogenic epitopes that induce high-titer cross-reactive antibodies. Similarly, there is anecdotal evidence that T cell tolerance can be broken by autoreactive B cells, which are readily elicited by immunization with cross-reactive foreign antigens that differ from self-antigen by one or a few amino acids (Mamula, et al. (1992) Breaking T cell tolerance with foreign and self co-immunogens. A study of autoimmune B and T cell epitopes of cytochrome c.â \nJ Immunol \n149: 789-795).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn contrast to the relatively nonselective chemical methods for modifying proteins, it is now possible to make highly precise âchemical mutationsâ to protein structure by means of genetically encoded unnatural amino acids. More than 50 unnatural amino acids have been encoded in bacteria, yeast, or mammalian cells including metal-binding and posttranslationally modified amino acids, fluorescent and redox-active amino acids, and photo- and chemically reactive amino acids (Wang, et al. (2001) Expanding the genetic code of \nEscherichia coli.â Science \n292: 498-500; Chin, et al. (2003) âAn expanded eukaryotic genetic code.â \nScience \n301: 964-967; Xie and Schultz (2006) âA chemical toolkit for proteinsâan expanded genetic code.â \nNat Rev Mol Cell Biol \n7: 775-782). More specifically, the phenylalanine derivative p-nitrophenylalanine (pNO\n2\nPhe, \nFIG. 1A\n) has been incorporated into proteins in bacteria in response to the amber nonsense codon with high fidelity and good efficiency for use as a spectroscopic distance probe (Tsao, et al. (2006) âThe genetic incorporation of a distance probe into proteins in \nEscherichia coli.â J Am Chem Soc \n128: 4572-4573). Nitroaryl groups have historically been used as highly immunogenic haptens (Keinan, Ed., Catalytic Antibodies (Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005), most likely because of the propensity of the electron-deficient pi system to interact with the Tyr and Trp side chains common to antibody combining sites. Because of their close structural similarity, we postulated that proteins containing either PheâpNO\n2\nPhe or TyrâpNO\n2\nPhe mutations might generate a robust immune response that would be cross-reactive with the native protein. Here, we show that immunization of mice with a Tyr\n86\nâpNO\n2\nPhe mutant of murine tumor necrosis factor-Î± (mTNFÎ±) generates a high-titer antibody response to WT mTNFÎ± that efficiently protects mice against a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nmTNFÎ± was chosen as the target protein for this study because: (i) it is a well characterized cytokine involved in the regulation of infectious, inflammatory, and autoimmune phenomena (Vassalli (1992) âThe Pathophysiology of Tumor Necrosis Factors.â \nAnn Rev Immunol \n10: 411-452); (ii) the biological properties of this protein have been extensively studied including its expression, structure, function, and signaling mechanisms (Vassalli (1992) âThe Pathophysiology of Tumor Necrosis Factors.â \nAnn Rev Immunol \n10: 411-452; Baeyens, et al. (1999) âThe structure of mouse tumour-necrosis factor at 1.4 A resolution: towards modulation of its selectivity and trimerization.â \nActa Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr \n55: 772-778; Pennica, et al. (1985) âCloning and expression in \nEscherichia coli \nof the cDNA for murine tumor necrosis factor.â \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n82: 6060-6064: Pasparakis, et al. (1996) âImmune and inflammatory responses in TNF alpha-deficient mice: a critical requirement for TNF alpha in the formation of primary B cell follicles, follicular dendritic cell networks and germinal centers, and in the maturation of the humoral immune response.â \nJ Exp Med \n184: 1397-1411; Baeyens, et al. (1997) âCrystallization and preliminary X-ray studies of mouse tumor necrosis factor.â \nActa Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr \n53: 329-330; B. B. Aggarwal, Vileck, J., Ed., \nTumor Necrosis Factors: Structure, Function and Mechanism of Action\n. (Dekker, New York, 1992), pp. 1-587); and (iii) mTNFÎ± knockout mice are viable and show no apparent phenotypic abnormalities (Pasparakis, et al. (1996) âImmune and inflammatory responses in TNF alpha-deficient mice: a critical requirement for TNF alpha in the formation of primary B cell follicles, follicular dendritic cell networks and germinal centers, and in the maturation of the humoral immune response.â \nJ Exp Med \n184: 1397-1411), suggesting that mice will survive a neutralizing immune response against TNFÎ±. In addition, anti-TNFÎ± antibodies (Knight, et al. (1993) âConstruction and initial characterization of a mouse-human chimeric anti-TNF antibody.â \nMol Immunol \n30: 1443-1453; Present, et al. (1999) âInfliximab for the Treatment of Fistulas in Patients with Crohn's Disease.â \nNew Engl J Med \n340: 1398-1405) and soluble chimeric TNFÎ± receptors (Peppel, et al. (1991) âA tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-IgG heavy chain chimeric protein as a bivalent antagonist of TNF activity.â \nJ Exp Med \n174: 1483-1489; Williams, et al. (1995) âSuccessful therapy of collagen-induced arthritis with TNF receptor-IgG fusion protein and combination with anti-CD4.â \nImmunology \n84: 433-439) are widely used in the treatment of autoimmune disease, and a number of approaches are being pursued to develop TNFÎ±-specific vaccines for clinical use. The latter include recombinant TNFÎ± molecules containing foreign immunodominant T-helper epitopes, TNFÎ± fusions to virus-like particles of the bacteriophage Q\nÎ²\n, and keyhole limpet hemocyanin-TNFÎ± heterocomplexes (Datum, et al. (1999) âTherapeutic antibodies elicited by immunization against TNF-alpha.â \nNat Biotechnol \n17: 666-669, Spohn, et al. (2007) âA Virus-Like Particle-Based Vaccine Selectively Targeting Soluble TNFÎ± Protects from Arthritis without Inducing Reactivation of Latent Tuberculosis.â \nJ Immunol \n178: 7450-7457; Le Buanec, et al. âTNFÎ± kinoid vaccination-induced neutralizing antibodies to TNFÎ± protect mice from autologous TNFÎ±-driven chronic and acute inflammation.â \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n103: 19442-19447).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on the X-ray crystal structure of trimeric mTNFÎ± (Baeyens, et al. (1997) âCrystallization and preliminary X-ray studies of mouse tumor necrosis factor.â \nActa Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr \n53: 329-330; Baeyens, et al. (1999) âThe structure of mouse tumour-necrosis factor at 1.4 A resolution: towards modulation of its selectivity and trimerization.â \nActa Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr \n55: 772-778) a single Tyr\n86\nâpNO\n2\nPhe mutant mTNFÎ± (pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±) was selected as an immunogen for our initial studies (\nFIG. 1B\n). Tyr\n86 \nis highly conserved among different mammalian TNFs, and it has been determined that mutations at this site have no effect on protein folding and trimer formation, but lead to a significant loss in cytotoxicity (Van Ostade, et al. (1994) âStructure-activity studies of human tumour necrosis factors.â \nProtein Engineering \n7: 5-22; Loetscher, et al. (1993) âHuman tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) mutants with exclusive specificity for the 55-kDa or 75-kDa TNF receptors.â \nJ Biol Chem \n268: 26350-7; Zhang, et al. (1992) âSite-directed mutational analysis of human tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor binding site and structure-functional relationship.â \nJ Biol Chem \n267: 24069-75) (which is advantageous for vaccination purposes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this example, the unnatural amino acid p-nitrophenylalanine (pNO\n2\nPhe) was genetically introduced into murine tumor necrosis factor-Î± (mTNFÎ±) to replace residue Tyr\n86\n. Mice immunized with this pNO\n2\nPhe containing protein were found to generate a strongly neutralizing antibody response that effectively cross-reacted with wild-type mTNFÎ±. Furthermore, this immunization was found to efficiently protect mice against a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced lethality. These results show that a self-protein, which bears a unique NO\n2 \ngroup, a highly immunogenic moiety not found in naturally occurring proteins, will be recognized as a foreign antigen by the immune system. Due to the close structure similarity of the protein comprising the unique NO\n2 \ngroup and the native protein, the antibodies elicited against the modified protein cross-reacted with the corresponding self-protein. This approach thus provides a general method for breaking immune tolerance of self-proteins and the production of vaccines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the experiments, \nE. coli \nXL1-Blue and BL21(DE3) were used as hosts for cloning and expression, respectively. The vector pET26b was obtained from Novagen (Madison, Wis., USA). Unless described otherwise, \nE. coli \nstrains were grown in minimal medium containing 1% glycerol and 0.3 mM leucine (GMML medium) or 2ÃYT medium. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, dNTPs, and factor Xa protease were obtained from NEB (Beverly, Mass., USA). IPTG and 4-12% Bis-Tris Gels for sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif., USA). pNO\n2\n-Phe was purchased from Advanced ChemTech (Louisville, KY, USA). Primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa, USA). DNA polymerase was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, Calif., USA). The anti-TNFÎ± antibody was from R&D system (Minneapolis, Minn., USA) and recombinant mTNFÎ± was obtained from BioSource (Camarillo, Calif., USA). Plasmid DNA was isolated using QIAGEN Plasmid Purification Kits and DNA purification after restriction digestion was performed using QIAquick PCR or gel purification kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, Calif., USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConstruction of an mTNFÎ± Expression Vector\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo express mTNFÎ± in \nE. coli\n, plasmid pET26-mTNFÎ± was constructed that consists of an N-terminal His\n6 \ntag, a factor Xa cleavage site and the mTNFÎ± gene behind the T7-lac promoter, was used. The plasmid was constructed as follows: The murine tnfÎ± gene was amplified from plasmid pMuTNFÎ± (ATCC # 63169) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the following primers: 5â²-ATATACATATGCTCAGATCATCTTCTCA AAATTCG and 5â²-AACAACCTCGAGTTATCACAGAGCAATGACTCCAAAGT AGACC. The resulting PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes and ligated into a pET26b vector (Novagen). The recombinant vector was then modified to append an N-terminal hexahistidine-tag (His\n6\n-tag) followed by a proteolysis site for factor Xa immediately prior to the first codon for mature WT mTNFÎ±. Site specific incorporation of pNO\n2\nPhe into mTNFÎ± mutant was carried out by mutating the codon for Tyr\n86\n, Lys\n11\n, or Asp\n42 \nwith a TAG amber codon in plasmid pET26-mTNFÎ±, and these substitutions were generated using the Quick Change Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The same kit was also used to prepare the mTNFÎ± mutants Ala\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± and Phe\n42 \nmTNFÎ±. The sequences of all mTNFÎ± constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis performed by the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (San Diego, Calif., USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExpression of pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± in \nEscherichia coli \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ±, and pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± mutants were then expressed in the presence of an orthogonal, amber suppressor tRNA\nCUA\n/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair derived from \nM. jannaschii \nthat specifically inserts pNO\n2\nPhe (structure shown in \nFIG. 1A\n) into proteins in \nE. coli \nin response to amber codon (Tsao, et al., (2006) âThe genetic incorporation of a distance probe into proteins in \nEscherichia coli.â J Am Chem Soc \n128:4572-4573). The mutant protein (Ë1 mg/L in GMML minimum medium) was purified by Ni\n2+\n affinity chromatography either under denaturing or native conditions, followed by cleavage of the His\n6 \ntag and size-exclusion chromatography. To express the pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ±, and pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± mutants, \nE. coli \nBL21(DE3) cells were co-transformed with mutNO\n2\nPheRS, mutRNA\nCUA \nand the respective mutant mTNFÎ± gene. The transformed cells were grown in the presence of 1 mM pNO\n2\nPhe in GMML medium at 37Â° C. and induced with 1 mM IPTG when OD\n600nm \nreached 0.5. The cells were then continually shaken at 37Â° C. for 12-16 h and then harvested. The cell pellet was stored at â80Â° C. until use. WT mTNFÎ±, Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, and Phe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± were expressed by essentially the same procedure. However, in contrast to the pNO\n2\nPhe mTNFÎ± mutants, these proteins were expressed in rich medium (2ÃYT medium) in the absence of pNO\n2\nPhe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification of WT mTNFÎ± and pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± Under Denaturing Conditions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll purification steps were performed at room temperature. After thawing the cell pellet for 15 minutes on ice, the cell paste was resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, pH=8.0, 10 mM Tris/HCl, 8M urea) at 5 ml per gram of wet weight. The cell suspension was sonicated on ice for 3 minutes. After centrifugation at 10,000Ãg for 25 minutes, 10 ml of Ni-NTA His-Bind Resin (Novagen, Madison, Wis., USA) was added to the supernatant and mixed on a rotary shaker for 60 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe lysate-resin mixture was loaded into a 5 ml polypropylene column (QIAGEN) and washed twice with 40 ml of wash buffer A (100 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, pH=6.3, mM Tris/HCl, 8M urea). After another two washing steps with 10 ml of wash buffer B (100 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, pH=5.9, 10 mM Tris/HCl, 8M urea), elution was carried out with 100 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, pH=4.5, 10 mM Tris/HCl, 8M urea. The protein mixture was concentrated with a 10K molecular weight cut-off Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore, Bedford, Mass., USA) and loaded onto a \nHiPrepâ¢\n 26/10 desalting column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J., USA) pre-equilibrated with factor Xa cleavage buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl; 200 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA, pH=7.4). Turbid fractions containing inclusion bodies were concentrated by several rounds of diafiltration using a 10K molecular weight cut-off Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device prior to addition of factor Xa (5% w/w).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nQuantitative removal of the N-terminal His\n6\n-tag was achieved within Ë3 days at room temperature as verified by SDS-PAGE analysis. After protease digestion, soluble factor Xa protease and the His\n6\n-tag peptide were separated from the inclusion bodies by centrifugation. The protein was then dissolved in Ë1 ml solubilization buffer (8M urea, 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH=8.0, 10 mM DTT) and injected onto a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with solubilization buffer. Two rounds of size-exclusion chromatography were carried out on an ÃKTA purifier instrument (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/minute. For refolding, the protein sample was dialyzed against renaturation buffer (240 mM NaCl; 10 mM KCl; 0.5% Triton X-100; 50 mM Tris/HCl; 1 mM EDTA, pH=8.0) using a 10K molecular weight cut-off Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassette (Pierce, Rockford, Ill., USA). The refolded pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification of WT and Mutant mTNFÎ± Under Native Conditions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll purification steps under native conditions were performed at 4Â° C. After thawing the cell pellet for 15 min on ice, the cell paste was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH=8.0; 150 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol) at 5 ml per gram wet weight. After addition of Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, 1N, USA), 10 mL of cell suspension was treated with 150 Î¼L of lysozyme (100 mg/mL; MP Biomedicals, Irvine, Calif., USA), 50 Î¼L of DNase I (5 mg/mL; Roche), 5 Î¼L of RNase A (100 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA), and 125 U benzonase nuclease (Novagen). The cell suspension was stirred at room temperature for 20 min to allow lysis to occur. The prelysed cells were then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed in a 37Â° C. water bath. This freeze-thaw cycle was repeated once. Complete lysis was then achieved by sonication on ice for 2 min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter centrifugation at 18,000Ãg for 20 min, 1 ml of Ni-NTA His-Bind Resin (Novagen) was added to the supernatant and mixed on a rotary shaker for 30 min. The lysate-resin mixture was loaded onto a 5 ml polypropylene column (QIAGEN) and washed twice with 20 ml of lysis buffer. Protein was eluted with 2 mL of elution buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; 150 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol), concentrated with a 10K molecular weight cut-off Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore), and further purified by a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (flow rate of 0.3 ml/min) pre-equilibrated with PBS. All proteins were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, which was performed on a Voyager-DE-STR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., USA) with sinapinic acid as a matrix at the Scripps Center for Mass Spectrometry, The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, Calif., USA). All mTNFÎ± proteins purified under native conditions were completely soluble at >10 mg/mL in PBS buffer (pH=7.5) at 25Â° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalyzing the Composition and Homogeneity of pNO Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe composition and homogeneity of the mutant protein was subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE (\nFIG. 1C\n) and mass spectrometry (\nFIG. 1D\n). Shown in \nFIG. 1C\n is the expression of the Tyr\n86 \namber mutant of mTNFÎ± in the absence (lane 2) and presence (lane 3) of 1 mM pNO\n2\nPhe with the pNO\n2\nPhe specific mutRNACUA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair. Protein samples were purified by Ni-NTA affinity column and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with SimplyBlueâ¢ staining. \nLane\n 4 represents wild-type mTNFÎ± and \nlane\n 1 is a molecular mass standard. The results depicted in \nFIG. 1C\n show that the pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± purified under denaturing conditions has a similar mobility on SDS-PAGE as WT mTNFÎ±; no full-length mTNFÎ± was observed when the mutant gene was expressed in the absence of pNO\n2\nPhe, indicating that there is no detectable incorporation of endogenous amino acids at \nposition\n 86.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe composition of homogeneity of the mutant protein was also analyzed by MS/MS sequencing analysis of its tryptic fragments (\nFIG. 1D\n). To prepare the protein sample for this procedure, an excised gel slice containing pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± was diced into small pieces and mixed with 100 Î¼L of 25 mM NH\n4\nHCO\n3\n/50% acetonitrile. After vortexing for 10 minutes, the supernatant was discarded. This step was repeated twice, and the gel pieces were then dried in a Speed Vac for approximately 20 minutes. The protein sample was reduced by addition of 25 Î¼l of 10 mM DTT in 25 mM NH\n4\nHCO\n3\n. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 56Â° C. for 1 hour. After removal of the supernatant, the gel pieces were mixed with 25 Î¼l of 55 mM iodoacetamide. After incubation in the dark for 45 minutes at room temperature, the gel pieces were subjected to tryptic in-gel digestion as described in a published procedure (Rosenfeld, et al., (1992) âIn-gel digestion of proteins for internal sequence analysis after one- or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.â \nAnal Biochem \n203:173-179; Hellman, et al., (1995) âImprovement of an âIn-Gelâ digestion procedure for the micropreparation of internal protein fragments for amino acid sequencing.â \nAnal Biochem \n224:451-455). The resultant peptide mixture was purified with C18 ZipTip (Millipore) and subjected to MS/MS fragmentation on a Thermo Finnigan LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Somerset, N.J., USA), which was run in positive ion mode using the nanospray source at the Scripps Center for Mass Spectrometry, The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, Calif., USA). The MS/MS analysis of an 8-mer tryptic fragment, prepared as described above, exactly matches the pattern for the incorporation of pNO\n2\nPhe at residue 86 (\nFIG. 1D\n, \nFIG. 12\n). The partial sequence of the octomer fragment FAISXQEK, where X denotes pNO\n2\nPhe, can be read from the annotated b or y ion series in \nFIG. 1D\n. In \nFIG. 12\n, the sequence of the tryptic fragment containing pNO\n2\n-Phe is shown in single letter code (X, pNO\n2\n-Phe). Observed fragment ions of the y and b series are indicated. Key y and b ions proving the incorporation of pNO\n2\n-Phe are represented in red. All masses are reported as monoisotopic masses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll proteins were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (\nFIGS. 2\n, \n3\n, and Table 1), which was performed on a Voyager-DE-STR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., USA) with sinapinic acid as a matrix at the Scripps Center for Mass Spectrometry, The Scripps Research Institute (La Jolla, Calif., USA). The MALDI-TOF spectrum (Table 1, \nFIG. 2\n) also shows a peak ([M-H]+:17287) that matches the expected molecular weight of pNO\n2\nPhe containing full-length mTNFÎ± ([M-H]+:17286).

All protein samples were analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FLPC) with a Superdex 75 10/300 GL gel filtration column (GE Healthcare). Size-exclusion chromatography was performed in PBS buffer at 25Â° C. using a flow rate of 0.3 ml/minute. Both WT mTNFÎ± and pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± were completely soluble at >10 mg/ml in PBS buffer (pH=7.5) at 25Â° C. The column was calibrated with a molecular weight gel-filtration standard from Bio-Rad (Bio-Rad Labs, Hercules, Calif., USA) containing thyroglobulin (670 kDa), gamma globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44.0 kDa), myoglobin (17.0 kDa), and vitamin B-12 (1.35 kDa). Protein elution was followed by measuring the absorption of eluted fractions at 280 nm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth WT mTNFÎ± and pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± showed a similar retention time that corresponded to a molecular weight matching their trimeric forms. A plot of the logarithm of the molecular mass of the protein standards versus the retention time on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL gel filtration column is shown in \nFIG. 4\n. Thyroglobulin (670 kDa) was omitted for calculation, because its molecular weight was far outside the separation range of the Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (3 kDa-70 kDa). Based on the plot shown in \nFIG. 4\n, the molecular masses of the quaternary structures pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, WT mTNFÎ±, mTNFÎ± F\n86\n, pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ±, mTNFÎ± F\n42\n, and pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ± were determined, and are shown in Table 2 (below).

HEK293 cells stably expressing NFÎºB-Luc were used in the reporter gene assay (Ye, et al., (2000) âER Stress Induces Cleavage of Membrane-Bound ATF6 by the Same Proteases that Process SREBPsâ \nMol Cell \n6:1355-1364). The stable cells were dissociated with trypsin, resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS at 5Ã10\n5 \ncells/ml, and plated at 20 Î¼l/well in 384-well white plate (Greiner, Longwood, Fla.). After 2 hours incubation at 5% CO\n2 \nin a 37Â° C. tissue culture incubator, 20 Î¼l of TNFÎ± was added to the cells. The cells were continuously incubated for 24 hours. Luciferase activities were measured by addition of 20 Î¼l Bright-Glo (Promega, Madison, Wis.), and the plate was read using a luminescence plate reader. The results of the assay indicated that, WT mTNFÎ± activated NFÎºB signaling in a NFÎºB-luciferase reporter cell line. In contrast, the pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmutant (\nFIG. 5\n) had only 2% of the activity of WT mTNFÎ± in the assay, consistent with previous reports that Tyr\n86 \nis essential for receptor binding and that a variety of mutations at \nresidue\n 86 lead to a significant loss in activity (Van Ostade, et al., (1994) âStructure-activity studies of human tumour necrosis factorsâ \nProtein Engineering \n7:5-22; Loetscher, et al., (1993) âHuman tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) mutants with exclusive specificity for the 55-kDa or 75-kDa TNF receptorsâ \nJ Biol Chem \n268:26350-7; Zhang, et al., (1992) âSite-directed mutational analysis of human tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor binding site and structure-functional relationshipâ \nJ Biol Chem \n267:24069-75). One additional peak was also found in the MALDI-TOF spectrum which corresponded to the deletion of first two amino acids of pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (Table 1, \nFIG. 2\n), presumably due to over-digestion during factor Xa proteolytic cleavage step. Because it was difficult to separate this truncated protein from full-length protein, and because the deletion of the first two N-terminal amino acids only slightly affected TNF activity (Van Ostade, et al., (1994) âStructure-activity studies of human tumour necrosis factorsâ \nProtein Engineering \n7:5-22), the mixture was used directly to immunize mice both for the mutant mTNFÎ± and WT control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional experiments were performed to show that the presence or absence of an N-terminal His\n6 \ntag had no influence on the immunization results (\nFIG. 13\n). Five Bcl2 mice, e.g., #3262, #3263, #3264, #3331, #3351, were randomized into two groups and injected with His\n6\n-Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (WT) or His\n6\n-pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, respectively, using the RIMMS (repetitive immunization at multiple sites) protocol (described below). Briefly, the mice were injected 8 times over 18 days. In each injection, 5 Î¼g of protein in 200 Î¼l PBS was mixed 1:1 with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) for the first injection, or with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) for the remaining injections at 6 specific sites proximal to peripheral lymph nodes. On \nday\n 21, antibody titers against pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± and Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a horseradish peroxidase conjugate of goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. See \nFIG. 13\n. In the figure, before immunization, the mouse serum was diluted 100 fold (1:100 pre) and after immunization the mouse serum was diluted either 1,000 fold (1:1 K post) or 10,000 fold (1:10 K post) and subjected to ELISA. The ELISA plate was coated either with WT mTNFÎ± (WT, first three bars) or pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (mod, last three bars).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalyzing Serum Titer Against pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± or WT mTNFÎ± in Mice Immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±\n\n\n \n \n \n \nmTNFÎ± knockout mice are viable and show no apparent phenotypic abnormalities (Pasparakis, et al. (1996) âImmune and inflammatory responses in TNF alpha-deficient mice: a critical requirement for TNF alpha in the formation of primary B cell follicles, follicular dendritic cell networks and germinal centers, and in the maturation of the humoral immune response.â \nJ Exp Med \n184: 1397-1411), suggesting that mice will survive a neutralizing immune response against TNFÎ±, allowing vaccinated mice to be analyzed for anti-TNFÎ± antibody production and biological activity. To determine the immunogenicity of the pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± mutant, thirty-two C57BL/6 mice were divided into three groups and injected with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, WT mTNFÎ±, and PBS buffer, respectively, following the RIMMS (repetitive immunization at multiple sites) protocol (Kilpatrick, et al., (1997) âRapid development of affinity matured monoclonal antibodies using RIMMSâ \nHybridoma \n16:381-389). To avoid adverse effects due to cytotoxicity of mTNFÎ±, a dose of 5 Î¼g of mTNFÎ± per injection was used throughout this study (Libert, et al., (1999) âIdentification of a locus on \ndistal mouse chromosome\n 12 that controls resistance to tumor necrosis factor-induced lethal shockâ \nGenomics \n55:284-289). \nFIG. 6\n shows the serum titers for C57BL/6 mice immunized with PBS (\n6\nA); WT mTNFÎ± (\n6\nB); pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (\n6\nC); or Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (\n6\nD). Briefly, mice were injected 8 times over 17 days. In each injection, 5 Î¼g of protein in 200/21 of PBS was mixed 1:1 with complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) for the first injection or with incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) for the remaining injections at 6 specific sites proximal to peripheral lymph nodes. On \nday\n 21, antibody titers against pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± and WT mTNFÎ± were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a horseradish peroxidase conjugate of goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo perform the ELISA, Maxisorp 384-well plates (Nunc, Rochester, N.Y.) were coated with 30 Î¼l of 0.5 Î¼g/ml protein overnight at 4Â° C. The coated plates were washed with PBS+0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), blocked with 80 Î¼l of 1% BSA in PBS, and washed again with PBST. The plates were sequentially incubated with 200 of primary antibody or serum diluted in 1% BSA in PBS, 20 Î¼l of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.), and 20 Î¼l of TMB substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, Md.), and read at an absorbance of 650 nm. The plates were washed with PBST between incubations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nELISAs were measured against WT mTNFÎ± (\nFIGS. 6A and 6B\n, left bars) or pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (\nFIGS. 6A and 6B\n, right bars). For mice immunized with Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, ELISAs were measured against WT mTNFÎ± (\nFIGS. 6C and 6D\n, left bars) or Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (\nFIGS. 6C and 6D\n, right bars). Before measurement, serum samples were diluted 1/1000 with 1% BSA in PBS buffer. Mice immunized with either WT mTNFÎ± or PBS buffer alone had insignificant serum IgG titers against both pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± and WT mTNFÎ± (\nFIG. 6\n). This is expected since WT mTNFÎ± is a self-protein and should be tolerated by the murine immune system. In contrast, mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± were found to display markedly high serum titers for both pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (\nFIG. 6C\n, right bars in each pair of bars) as well as WT mTNFÎ± (\nFIG. 6C\n, left bars in eacf pair of bars). Thus, a single pNO\n2\nPhe mutation (which altered the monomer molecular weight by 29 Daltons) induced a strong immunological response that resulted in antibodies that are highly cross-reactive with WT mTNFÎ±. Similar results were obtained with Bcl-2 mice, indicating that this result was not strain dependent (\nFIG. 7\n). Again, the RIMMS protocol involved 8 injections (5 Î¼g protein/injection) over a period of 17 days in the presence of CFA for the initial injection and IFA for the remaining 7 injections. ELISAs were measured against WT mTNFÎ± (second and first bars in each group of four bars) or pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (fourth and third bars in each group of four bars). Before measurement, serum samples were diluted either 1/100 or 1/1000 with 1% BSA in PBS buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe also examined the immunogenicity in the absence of strong immunopotentiators and found that immunization of Bcl-2 mice with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± in the absence of any adjuvant also elicited significant anti-TNFÎ± titers (\nFIG. 8\n), suggesting that this approach can be applicable to therapeutic settings in which strong adjuvants are not desirable. Serum titers for Bcl-2 mice immunized with (a) WT mTNFÎ±, or (b) pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± for 8 injections (5 Î¼g protein/injection) over a period of 17 days in the absence of either CFA or IFA. ELISAs were measured against WT mTNFÎ± (left bar in each pair of bars) or pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (right bar in each pair of bars). Before measurement, serum samples were diluted 1/1000 with 1% BSA in PBS buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the duration of the antibody response after a sequence of eight immunizations with the pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± was found to quite robust after 19 weeks (\nFIG. 14\n). Such a long sustainability is highly desirable for clinical use, because current strategies often suffer from rapidly decreasing autoantibody titers when immunization ceases. \nFIG. 14\n shows results of the determination of serum titer durability. To perform the experiment, three Bcl-2 transgenic mice were immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±. After a sequence of eight immunizations, bleeds were taken for ELISA analysis against pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± at defined time points. Before each measurement, serum samples were diluted 1:100 with 1% BSA in PBS buffer. At corresponds to the time period between the last immunization and the bleed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo verify that the immunological response was a result of the immunogenic nitroaryl group of the unnatural amino acid, a Tyr\n86\nâPhe mutant, mTNFÎ± (Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±) was generated. After confirmation of its trimeric quaternary structure by size-exclusion chromatography, Bcl2 mice were immunized with this mutant either in the presence or absence of CFA/IFA. For mice immunized without adjuvant, the RIMMS protocol involved 8 injections (5 Î¼g protein/injection) over a period of 17 days. For mice immunized with adjuvant, CFA was used for the first injection and IFA for the remaining 7 injections. ELISAs were measured against WT mTNFÎ± (\nFIG. 9\n, second and first bars in each group of four bars) or Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (\nFIG. 9\n, fourth and third bars in each group of four bars). Before measurement, serum samples were diluted either 1/100 or 1/1000 with 1% BSA in PBS buffer. In both cases, e.g., presence or absence of adjuvant, no significant anti-TNFÎ± titers were generated, indicating that the NO\n2 \ngroup is required to break immunological tolerance (\nFIGS. 6D and 9\n). Furthermore, CD\n4\n \n+\n T cells specific for pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± were elicited only when mice were immunized with this mutant protein and not when mice were immunized with WT mTNFÎ± or Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (\nFIG. 15A\n). In contrast, no significant proliferation was observed when CD\n4\n \n+\n T cells from pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±-immunized Bcl-2 mice were stimulated in vitro with WT mTNFÎ± (\nFIG. 15B\n). To perform the T-cell proliferation assays, CD4\n+\n T cells from immunized mice were isolated from lymph nodes by magnetic depletion with MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotec). T cells were then placed into culture with irradiated splenocytes from naÃ¯ve Bcl-2 mice and increasing amounts of antigen. The cultures were incubated for 48 h and then pulsed with [\n3\nH]thymidine overnight. The culture plates were harvested onto filter mats and radioactivity was quantified with a TopCount scintillation counter (PerkinElmer).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreliminary epitope mapping experiments with mTNFÎ± mutants and peptide fragments of WT mTNFÎ± indicate that the polyclonal response to pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± involves multiple protein epitopes. Together, these results suggest that insertion of pNO\n2\nPhe into the sequence of mTNFÎ± creates a T cell epitope, which enhances T cell help to trigger an effective immune response against this disease-associated self protein. Other immunization protocols (e.g., sequential immunization with the mutant and WT TNFÎ±) can also yield high-titer cross-reactive antibodies. These results are consistent with those of Dalum, et al. (1999) âTherapeutic antibodies elicited by immunization against TNF-alpha.â \nNat Biotechnol \n17: 666-669, who incorporated immunodominant T-helper cell epitopes into mTNFÎ± to break immune tolerance. The current strategy, however, results in minor pertubations in a protein and should not disrupt its tertiary fold or dramatically affect expression, solubility, or stability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe polypeptide sequence surrounding Tyr\n86 \nis not predicted to be a T-cell epitope based on in silico sequence-based analysis of potential MHC class II DR epitopes in TNFÎ± (Steed, et al. (2003) âInactivation of TNF Signaling by Rationally Designed Dominant-Negative TNF Variants.â \nScience \n301: 1895-1898). Nonetheless, to begin to explore the generality of this approach, we determined whether substitution of pNO\n2\nPhe at other sites might have a similar effect. The surface exposed residue Asp\n42\n, which is not involved in trimerization or receptor binding, was therefore mutated to pNO\n2\nPhe. After confirming the mutation by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, two groups of C57BL/6 mice were immunized with either pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± or the Phe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± mutant (\nFIG. 10\n). The RIMMS protocol involved 8 injections (5 Î¼g protein/injection) over a period of 17 days in the absence of adjuvant. ELISAs were measured against WT mTNFÎ± (\nFIG. 10A\n, first bars in each group of three bars; \nFIG. 10B\n, first bars in each pair of bars), pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ±/pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ± (\nFIG. 10A\n, second bars in each group of three bars; \nFIG. 10B\n, second bars in each pair of bars in 7, 8, and 9), or Phe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± (\nFIG. 10A\n, third bars in each group of bars) or PBS (\nFIG. 10B\n, second bars in each pair of bars in 5 and 6). Before measurement, serum samples were diluted 1/100 (\nFIG. 10A\n) or 1/800 (\nFIG. 10B\n) with 1% BSA in PBS buffer. Again, significant anti-TNFÎ± titers were elicited only by immunization with pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± immunized mice elicited significant anti-TNFÎ± titers. This result indicated that pNO\n2\nPhe mutagenesis would be a fairly general approach to render specific self- or foreign antigens highly immunogenic.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar result was obtained with mutation of another surface-exposed residue, Lys\n11\n, to pNO\n2\nPhe. These results suggest that pNO\n2\nPhe mutagenesis can be a fairly general approach to render specific self- or foreign antigens highly immunogenic and may not be limited to substitutions at surface-exposed Tyr or Phe residues. However, preliminary studies indicate that incorporation of pNO\n2\nPhe is less effective at \npositions\n 104 and 19. Immunization of C57BL/6 mice with pNO\n2\nPhe\n104 \nmTNFÎ± resulted in the generation of antibodies that lacked significant cross-reactivity with native mTNFÎ±. Thus, context effects play a role in determining the nature of the immune response. Finally, it is likely that other genetically encoded immunogenic amino acids can also be beneficially used; alternatively for smaller antigens, immunogenic unnatural amino acids can be incorporated by semisynthesis or total peptide synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalyzing the Response of pNO Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± Immunized Mice to LPS Challenge\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe next determined whether vaccination of mice with the pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nTNFÎ± would protect against a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in a severe endotoxemia mouse model (F. Niessen, et al. (2008) âDendritic cell PAR-S1P3 signalling couples coagulation and inflammation.â \nNature \n452: 654-658). Septic shock induced by LPS in this model was known to involve in the production and release of TNFÎ±. All experiments to study mouse endotoxemia were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Animal Protection Guidelines and were approved by The Scripps Research Institute Animal Care and Use Committee. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, \nE. coli \nO111:B4, Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences, San Diego, Calif., USA) was dissolved in 37Â° C. normal saline (0.9% w/v of NaCl) by vortexing for 30 seconds before and after two minutes of sonication. Male C57BL/6 mice from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Me., USA) were injected intraperitoneally under 2% isoflurane at the age of 9 weeks with 7.5 mg/kg LPS for the passive immunizations or 15 weeks with 8.5 mg/kg LPS for the active immunization. All experiments were carried out in a room with alternating 12 h light dark cycles under stable conditions of temperature (20-22Â° C.) and relative humidity (40-60%). Kaplan-Meier survival plots of mice receiving active or passive immunizations are shown in \nFIG. 11\n. The Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted and survival differences were analyzed using a log rank test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC57BL/6 mice were immunized with PBS, WT mTNFÎ± and pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±. These mice were subsequently injected intraperitoneally with LPS (8.5 mg/kg) three days after completion of the above immunization regime, and their survival rate was determined. In \nFIG. 11A\n, mice (8 per group) immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± or WT mTNFÎ± were compared with 7 mice receiving sham immunizations. Survival advantage of mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (p<0.01) vs. wild-type is shown. In \nFIG. 11B\n, mice (8 per group) injected with 100 Î¼g purified IgG from pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± or wild-type immunized mice were compared to controls receiving saline injection. Survival advantage of mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (p<0.01) vs. wild-type is shown. In \nFIG. 11C\n, mice (6 per group) received 100 Î¼L of pooled serum from mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± or wild-type mTNFÎ±. Survival advantage of mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (p<0.01) vs. wild-type is shown. Control mice were injected with equal volumes of physiological saline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs depicted in \nFIG. 11A\n, mice immunized with the pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± mutant showed a significantly greater survival advantage (87.5%) than those that received PBS and WT mTNFÎ± (12.5% survival rate) immunizations. Similarly, C57BL/6 mice receiving either pooled serum (100 uL) or purified IgG antibody (4 mg/kg) collected from Bcl-2 mice pre-immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± showed a significantly higher survival rate (83.3-87.5%) than those receiving pooled serum or IgG from Bcl-2 mice immunized with WT mTNFÎ± (16.7-25.0%) (\nFIGS. 11B\n, \n11\nC). Hence, these results demonstrate that a single NO\n2\nPhe mutant of a self-protein induces a robust cross-reactive antibody response against native protein that is protective in a disease model. We are currently extending these studies to other TNFÎ± dependent models including collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model and KRN transgenic mouse (K/BÃN) model (Ditzel (2004) âThe K/BÃN mouse: A model of human inflammatory arthritis.â \nTrends Mol Med \n10: 40-45).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IgG antibody used in the injections described above was prepared by loading murine serum onto a 10 ml sepharose-conjugated protein G affinity column (GammaBind Plus Sepharose, Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, N.J., USA). The column was washed with three column volumes of PBS (\npH\n 7=4). Elution was carried out with two column volumes of 0.1M acetic acid (\npH\n 3=0). The eluate was then neutralized with 1M Tris/HCl (pH=9.0) and dialyzed into PBS (pH=7.4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMice were passively immunized 24 hours prior to the endotoxin challenge. In the first experiment, mice received an intraperitoneal injection of 100 Î¼L of pooled serum from mice immunized with either pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± or WT mTNFÎ±. A second cohort received 4 mg/kg of IgG purified from serum of mice immunized with either pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± or WT mTNFÎ±. Control mice were injected with equal volumes of physiological saline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above findings demonstrate that a single mutation of Tyr\n86 \nto pNO\n2\nPhe (the only difference with WT-protein was substitution of an âOH with an âNO\n2 \ngroup at a solvent exposed site) dramatically enhanced the immunogenicity of the protein and led to a neutralizing antibody response in a TNFÎ± dependent mouse model. Mutagenesis of \nresidues\n 86 and close proximal residue 85 to Ala had little effect on the antibody titers to either the pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nor WT protein, indicating that the antibodies recognized a discontinuous epitope. The results indicate that a protein bearing a unique NO\n2 \ngroup, a highly immunogenic moiety not found in natural occurring proteins, will be recognized as a foreign antigen by the immune system. Due to the close structure similarity, the elicited antibodies cross-reacted with the corresponding self-protein thereby breaking immunological tolerance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis example shows that it is possible to break immunological self-tolerance tolerance, e.g., for vaccine production, by the site-specific incorporation of pNO\n2\nPhe into a protein epitope, e.g., in target self-proteins. Although it has been known for some time that altered proteins can induce autologous antibodies, the ill-defined nature of the changes that render the proteins immunogenic complicate their production and therapeutic utility (Lerner, et al. (1968) âThe induction of acute glomerulonephritis in rabbits with soluble antigens isolated from normal homologous and autologous urineâ \nJ Immunol \n100:1277-1287). For example, the arsanil-sulfanil-thryoglobulin preparations used in the studies of Weigle contained Ë50 azo linkages per molecule of thyroglobulin (Weigle (1965) âThe production of thyroiditis and antibody following injection of unaltered thyroglobulin without adjuvant into rabbits previously stimulated with altered thyroglobulinâ \nJ Exp Med \n122:1049-1062), resulting in a highly heterogeneous and possibly aggregated or partially unfolded antigen. Similarly, insertion of T-cell epitopes at various positions in antigens can create proteins with altered tertiary structure, solubility, and stability compared with native protein. In contrast, the changes made here are chemically defined and confined to single residues. Moreover, these mutations do not appear to affect the overall quaternary structure of the protein nor its solubility. The resulting antibodies are therefore more likely to recognize the corresponding epitopes in the native protein. Finally, pNO\n2\nPhe-containing TNFÎ± mutants induced a protective cross-reactive immune response without the need for strong adjuvants and resulted in high titers for at least 4 months, attributes that may facilitate therapeutic applications of this methodology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis strategy can be applicable to other self-proteins, including those associated with protein folding diseases (e.g., amyloid-beta1-42 peptide) or cancer. In addition, by introducing the pNO\n2\nPhe group at weakly immunogenic or otherwise silent epitopes, this approach may also permit the generation of a strong antibody response against regions of a pathogen that are predicted to result in neutralizing antibodies against viral, bacterial or parasite infections (e.g., the CS1 protein of malaria or the E410 epitope of HIV-1 gp41). Furthermore, the selective introduction of immunogenic amino acids into proteins can facilitate the generation of functional antibodies, e.g., agonists or antagonists, of G protein-coupled receptors and other membrane-bound receptors for which it has historically been difficult to generate strong antibody responses. The structural bases for this phenomenon and exploration of its application to human disease are currently being elucidated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExplanation of Results Depicted in Figures of Example 1\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 1\n shows the results of experiments that were performed to confirm the incorporation of pNO\n2\nPhe into mTNFÎ±. \nFIG. 1A\n shows the structure of the unnatural amino acid pNO\n2\nPhe. \nFIG. 1B\n provides an X-ray crystal structure of mTNFÎ± trimer with Tyr-86, Asp-42, and Lys-11 indicated (PDB ID code 2TNF). \nFIG. 1C\n shows the results of experiments that were performed to confirm, that the expression of the Tyr\n86 \namber mutant of mTNFÎ± occurs in the presence (lane 3), but not in the absence (lane 2) of 1 mM pNO\n2\nPhe with the pNO\n2\nPhe-specific mutRNA\nCUA\n/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair. Protein samples in \nFIG. 1C\n were purified by Ni-NTA affinity column under denaturing conditions and analyzed by SDS/PAGE with SimplyBlue staining. \nLane\n 4 contains WT mTNFÎ±, and \nlane\n 1 is a molecular mass standard. The pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± mutant is characterized in \nFIG. 1D\n. A tandem mass spectrum of the octamer fragment FAISXQEK is provided, where X denotes pNO\n2\nPhe. The octamer fragment was produced from trypsin digestion of pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±. The partial sequence of the octamer containing pNO\n2\nPhe can be read from the annotated b or y ion series.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral experiments were performed to confirm the incorporation of pNO\n2\nPhe into mTNFÎ± and to show that the incorporation of pNO\n2\nPhe did not affect the quaternary structure of the unnatural TNFÎ±. \nFIG. 2\n provides the results of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, and \nFIG. 3\n provides the results of a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of WT mTNFÎ±. The peaks in \nFIG. 2\n confirm that the mass of the unnatural TNFÎ± indicate that a pNO\n2\nPhe residue was incorporated. \nFIG. 4\n depicts the results of FPLC experiments performed to determine the effects of Tyr\n86\nâpNO\n2\nPhe substitution on the tertiary structure of a mutant mTNFÎ± protein. The mutant eluted at a time that indicates that the mutant trimerizes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivity asses were also performed on the mutant TNFÎ±. \nFIG. 5\n shows the results of NF-ÎºB-luciferase activity analysis of WT mTNFÎ± (squares), pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (triangles), pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± (inverted triangles), Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (diamonds), and Phe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± (circles). The unnatural TNFÎ±'s activity is reduced compared to WT TNFÎ±.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSerum titers for C57BL/6 mice immunized with PBS are shown in \nFIG. 6A\n; serum titers for mice immunized with WT mTNFÎ± are shown in \nFIG. 6B\n; serum titers for mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± are shown in \nFIG. 6C\n; and serum titers mice immunized with Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± are shown in \nFIG. 6D\n. Mice immunized with either WT mTNFÎ± or PBS buffer alone had insignificant serum IgG titers against both pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± and WT mTNFÎ±. This is expected since WT mTNFÎ± is a self-protein and should be tolerated by the murine immune system. In contrast, mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± were found to display markedly high serum titers for both pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe protocol involved eight injections (5 Î¼g of protein per injection) over a period of 17 days in the presence of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) for the initial injection and incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) for the remainder. ELISAs were measured against WT mTNFÎ± (left bars in each pair of bars 1-32) pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (right bars in each pair of bars 1-32). For mice immunized with Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (\nFIG. 6D\n), ELISAs were measured against WT mTNFÎ± (left bars in each pair of bars 33-36) or Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (right bars in each pair of bars 33-36). Before measurement, serum samples were diluted 1:1,000 with 1% BSA in PBS buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar results were as those above were obtained with Bcl-2 mice, indicating that this result was not strain dependent. \nFIG. 7\n shows serum titer levels against WT mTNFÎ± and pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± for Bcl2 mice immunized WT mTNFÎ± or pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±. The MAIMS protocol involved eight injections (5 Î¼g of protein per injection) over a period of 17 days in the presence of CFA for the initial injection and IFA for the remaining seven injections. ELISAs were measured against WT mTNFÎ± (second and first bars in each group of four bars) or pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (fourth and third bars in each group of four bars). Before measurement, serum samples were diluted either 1:100 or 1:1,000 with 1% BSA in PBS buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 8\n shows the results of serum titer measurements for mice that were immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± in the absence of adjuvant. This immunization also elicited significant anti-TNFÎ± titers, suggesting that this approach can be applicable to therapeutic settings in which strong adjuvants are not desirable. Serum titers for Bcl-2 mice immunized with WT mTNFÎ± are shown in \nFIG. 8A\n, and titers for mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± are shown in \nFIG. 8B\n. The immunizations were performed as follows: eight injections (5 Î¼g of protein per injection) were done over a period of 17 days in the absence of either CFA or IFA. ELISAs were measured against WT mTNFÎ± (left bars in each pair of bars) or pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (right bars in each pair of bars). Before measurement, serum samples were diluted 1:1,000 with 1% BSA in PBS buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo verify that the immunological response was a result of the immunogenic nitroaryl group of the unnatural amino acid, a Tyr\n86\nâPhe mutant, mTNFÎ± (Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±) was generated, and Bcl2 mice were immunized with this mutant either in the presence or absence of CFA/IFA. \nFIG. 9\n provides serum titer measurements against WT mTNFÎ± and Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± for Bcl2 mice immunized with Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± in the absence or presence of adjuvant. In both cases, e.g., presence or absence of adjuvant, no significant anti-TNFÎ± titers were generated, indicating that the NO\n2 \ngroup is required to break immunological tolerance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor mice immunized without adjuvant, the RIMMS protocol involved eight injections (5 Î¼g of protein per injection) over a period of 17 days. For mice immunized with adjuvant, CFA was used for the first injection and IFA for the remaining seven injections. ELISAs were measured against WT mTNFÎ± (second and first bars in each group of four bars) or Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (fourth and third bars in each group of four bars). Before measurement, serum samples were diluted either 1:100 or 1:1,000 with 1% BSA in PBS buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 10\n shows the results of experiments that were performed to determine the immunogenicity of other surface sites on TNFÎ±. In \nFIG. 10A\n, serum titers against WT mTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ±, and Phe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± for C57BL/6 mice immunized with either pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± or Phe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± are shown. In \nFIG. 10B\n, serum titers against WT mTNFÎ±, PBS, and pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ± for C57BL16 mice immunized with either pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ± or WT mTNFÎ± are shown. Significant anti-TNFÎ± titers were elicited only by immunization with pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± immunized mice elicited significant anti-TNFÎ± titers. This result indicated that pNO\n2\nPhe mutagenesis would be a fairly general approach to render specific self- or foreign antigens highly immunogenic\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe RIMMS protocol in the experiment involved eight injections (5 Î¼g of protein per injection) over a period of 17 days in the absence of adjuvant. ELISAs were measured against WT mTNFÎ± (first bars in each group of three bars in \n10\nA; left bars in each pair of bars in \n10\nB), pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ±/pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ± (second bars in each group of three bars in \n10\nA; right bars in each pair of \n \n \nbars\n \n \n 7, 8, and 9 in \n10\nB), Phe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± (third bars in each group of three bars in \n10\nA), or PBS (right bars in each pair of \n \nbars\n \n 5 and 6 in \n10\nB). Before measurement, serum samples were diluted 1/100 (for \n10\nA) or 1/800 (for \n10\nB) with 1% BSA in PBS buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeptic shock induced by LPS in this model was known to involve in the production and release of TNFÎ±. Thus, it was next determined whether vaccination of mice with the pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nTNFÎ± would protect against a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in a severe endotoxemia mouse model (F. Niessen, et al. (2008) âDendritic cell PAR-S1P3 signalling couples coagulation and inflammation.â \nNature \n452: 654-658). \nFIG. 11\n shows the results of experiments that were performed to determine whether immunization with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± improves survival of mice in a TNFÎ±-dependent severe endotoxemia model. Kaplan-Meier survival plots of mice receiving active or passive immunizations are shown. In \nFIG. 11A\n, mice (eight per group) immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± or WT mTNFÎ± are compared with seven mice receiving sham immunizations. Survival advantage of mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (P<0.01) vs. WT is shown. In \nFIG. 11B\n, mice (eight per group) injected with 100 Î¼g of purified IgG from pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± or WT immunized mice were compared with controls receiving saline injection. Survival advantage of mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (P<0.01) vs. WT is shown. In \nFIG. 11C\n, Mice (six per group) received 100 Î¼l of pooled serum from mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± or WT mTNFÎ±. Survival advantage of mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (P<0.01) vs. WT is shown.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 12\n provides the results of MS/MS analysis of an 8-mer tryptic fragment derived from pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±. The sequence of the tryptic fragment containing pNO\n2\nPhe is shown in single letter code (X=pNO\n2\nPhe). Observed fragment ions of the y and b series are indicated. Key y and b ions proving the incorporation of pNO\n2\nPhe are b\n5\n, b\n6\n, b\n7\n, y\n7\n, y\n6\n, y\n5\n, and y\n4\n. All masses are reported as monoisotopic masses. The MS/MS analysis exactly matches the pattern for the incorporation of pNO\n2\nPhe at \nresidue\n 86.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 13\n depicts the results of experiments that were performed to show that the presence of an N-terminal His\n6 \ntag on His\n6\n-Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (WT) or His\n6\n-pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± had no influence on the results of subsequent immunization experiments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLong sustainability of serum antibody titers is highly desirable for clinical use, because current strategies often suffer from rapidly decreasing autoantibody titers when immunization ceases. \nFIG. 14\n shows the results of experiments performed to determine serum titer durability of the immune response againt TNFÎ±. Three Bcl-2 transgenic mice were immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±. After a sequence of eight immunizations, bleeds were taken for ELISA analysis against pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± at defined time points. Before each measurement, serum samples were diluted 1:100 with 1% BSA in PBS buffer. Ît corresponds to the time period between the last immunization and the bleed. The first bar in each group of 6 bars is prebleed, the second bar is Ît=1 week, the third bar is Ît=8 weeks, the fourth bar is Ît=12 weeks, the fifth bar is Ît=16 weeks, and the sixth bar is Ît=19 weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 15\n shows the results of T cell proliferative assays. In \nFIG. 15A\n, proliferation of CD4+ T cells from Bcl-2 transgenic mice immunized with WT mTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, and Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± and stimulated in vitro with serial dilutions of pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± is shown. In \nFIG. 15B\n, proliferation of CD4+ T cells from Bcl-2 transgenic mice immunized with WT mTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, and Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± and stimulated in vitro with serial dilutions of WT mTNFÎ± is shown. CD\n4\n \n+\n T cells specific for pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± were elicited only when mice were immunized with this mutant protein and not when mice were immunized with WT mTNFÎ± or Phe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±. In contrast, no significant proliferation was observed when CD\n4\n \n+\n T cells from pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±-immunized Bcl-2 mice were stimulated in vitro with WT mTNFÎ±.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nMechanistic Studies of the Immunochemical Termination of Tolerance with Unnatural Amino Acids\n\n\n \n \n \nExample 2 characterizes the nature and durability of the polyclonal IgG antibody response created by incorporation of an unnatural amino acid(s) into TNFÎ± and adds additional support for the generality of unnatural amino acid-induced (e.g., pNO\n2\nPhe-induced) loss of self-tolerance. Example 2 shows that the mutation of several surface residues of murine tumor necrosis factor-Î± (mTNFÎ±) independently to p-nitrophenylalanine (pNO\n2\nPhe) lead to a T cell-dependent polyclonal and sustainable anti-mTNFÎ± IgG autoantibody response lasting for at least 40 weeks. The Example shows that the antibodies bound multiple epitopes on mTNFÎ± and protected mice from severe endotoxemia induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Immunization of mice with a pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmutant of murine retinol binding protein (RBP4) was also shown to elicit a high titer IgG antibody response, which was cross-reactive with wild-type mRBP4. Thus, Example 2 further supports that the current invention can be a general approach to generate effective immunotherapeutics against cancer-associated or other weakly immunogenic antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor over two centuries active immunotherapy has been at the forefront of efforts to prevent infectious disease (Waldmann, T. A. (2003) âImmunotherapy: past, present and futureâ \nNat Med \n9:269-277). However, the decreased ability of the immune system to mount a robust immune response to self-antigens has made it more difficult to generate therapeutic vaccines against cancer or chronic degenerative diseases. Recently, we showed that the site-specific incorporation of an immunogenic unnatural amino acid into an autologous protein offers a simple and effective approach to overcome self-tolerance (see Grunewald, J. et al. (2008) âImmunochemical termination of self-toleranceâ \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n105:11276-11280 and Example 1). Here we characterize the nature and durability of the polyclonal IgG antibody response and begin to establish the generality of pNO\n2\nPhe-induced loss of self-tolerance. Mutation of several surface residues of murine tumor necrosis factor-Î± (mTNFÎ±) independently to p-nitrophenylalanine (pNO\n2\nPhe) leads to a T cell-dependent polyclonal and sustainable anti-mTNFÎ± IgG autoantibody response that lasts for at least 40 weeks. The antibodies bind multiple epitopes on mTNFÎ± and protect mice from severe endotoxemia induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Immunization of mice with a pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmutant of murine retinol binding protein (RBP4) also elicited a high titer IgG antibody response, which was cross-reactive with wild-type mRBP4. These findings suggest that this may be a relatively general approach to generate effective immunotherapeutics against cancer associated or other weakly immunogenic antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCritical to the process of immunological self-nonself discrimination is self-tolerance (Goodnow (2007) âMultistep pathogenesis of autoimmune diseaseâ \nCell \n130:25-35), in which a mammal's immune system is âtolerizedâ to self-proteins in order to avoid autoimmune disease, primarily due to the absence or inactivation of self-reactive B- or T-cells. It has been known for years, however, that the immune system can be induced to attack self-proteins. For example, cross-reactive immune responses to self-proteins can be induced by introducing foreign T helper cell epitopes into chimeric antigens (Dalum, et al. (1999) âTherapeutic antibodies elicited by immunization against TNF-alphaâ \nNat Biotechnol \n17:666-669, Zuany-Amorim, et al. (2004) âInduction of TNF-alpha autoantibody production by AutoVac TNF106: a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of allergic diseasesâ \nInt Arch Allergy Immunol \n133:154-163), by extensive chemical derivatization of self-antigens (Weigle, W. O. (1965) âThe Induction of Autoimmunity in Rabbits Following Injection of Heterologous or Altered Homologous Thyroglobulinâ \nJ Exp Med \n121:289-308), and by DNA vaccines (Leitner, et al. (2003) âAlphavirus-based DNA vaccine breaks immunological tolerance by activating innate antiviral Pathwaysâ \nNat Med \n9:33-39). Furthermore, a number of specific genes and cellular mechanisms involved in self-tolerance have been identified which when disrupted result in breakdown of tolerance and autoimmune disease (Goodnow (2007) âMultistep pathogenesis of autoimmune diseaseâ \nCell \n130:25-35; Hill, et al. (2008) âRecent acquisitions on the genetic basis of autoimmune diseaseâ \nFront Biosci \n13:4838-4851). Despite these advances, the design of effective immunotherapeutics has been a slow process, as exemplified by the fact that only a few vaccines for cancer treatment have reached late stage clinical development (Small, et al. (2006) âPlacebo controlled phase III trial of immunologic therapy with sipuleucel-T (APC8015) in patients with metastatic, asymptomatic hormone refractory prostate cancerâ \nJ Clin Oncol \n24:3089-3094; Schlom, et al. (2007) âRole of vaccine therapy in cancer: biology and practiceâ \nCurr Oncol \n14:238-245).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNitroaryl groups are highly immunogenic, likely due to their ability to form strong stacking and van der Waals interactions. Indeed, the nonspecific derivatization of autologous cancer cells with dinitrophenyl groups has been exploited as a vaccine in melanoma patients (Berd, D. (2004) âM-Vax: an autologous, hapten-modified vaccine for human cancer.â \nExpert Rev Vaccines \n3:521-527), and physiological 3â²-nitrotyrosine formation has been implicated in the pathology of a number of autoimmune diseases (Aulak, et al. (2001) âProteomic method identifies proteins nitrated in vivo during inflammatory challengeâ \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n98:12056-12061; Pacher, et al. (2007) âNitric oxide and peroxynitrite in health and diseaseâ\nPhysiol Rev \n87:315-424; Hardy, et al. (2008) âConversion of tyrosine to the inflammation-associated \nanalog\n 3â²-nitrotyrosine at either TCR- or MHC-contact positions can profoundly affect recognition of the MHC class I-restricted epitope of lymphocytic \nchoriomeningitis virus glycoprotein\n 33 by CD8 T cells.â \nJ Immunol \n180: 5956-5962). To test whether this immunogenic group could be used to break tolerance to specific self-proteins, we previously introduced a p-nitrophenylalanine (pNO\n2\nPhe) residue at a single site in murine TNFÎ±. Genetic substitution of pNO2Phe for Tyr86 of mTNFÎ± created a T cell epitope, which enhanced T cell help to elicit a strong cross-reactive antibody response against this disease-related self-protein (Grunewald, J. et al. (2008) âImmunochemical termination of self-tolerance.â \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n105: 11276-11280). Here, we show that immunochemical breakdown of self-tolerance leads to sustained high-titer antibody responses that efficiently protect mice against a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. Moreover, we demonstrate that this methodology is generalizable to a self-protein unrelated to immune function, namely retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMechanistic Studies of pNO Phe-Induced Breakdown of Self-Tolerance\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreviously, we showed that substitution of pNO\n2\nPhe for Tyr86 in mTNFÎ± led to a high titer cross-reactive antibody response to wildtype (WT) protein. The mutant protein was shown to induce T-cell proliferation in immunized animals, whereas WT protein did not (Grunewald, J. et al. (2008) âImmunochemical termination of self-tolerance.â \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n105: 11276-11280). To provide further evidence for a T cell-dependent immune response against pNO\n2\nPhe TNFÎ±, we have carried out ELISA analysis of the mTNFÎ± autoantibodies with either anti-mouse IgM or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. The majority of the anti-mTNFÎ± autoantibodies in sera from Bcl-2 mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± are of the IgG subtype, indicating T cell-mediated immunoglobulin class switching (\nFIG. 16A\n). To determine whether the presence of pNO\n2\nPhe is critical throughout the immunization process, we initially injected 4 mice with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) followed by 7 injections of either WT mTNFÎ± or pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA). The results shown in \nFIG. 20\n clearly demonstrate that, in contrast to pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, WT mTNFÎ± cannot sustain significant titers of cross-reactive anti-mTNFÎ± antibodies. This result supports the notion that pNO\n2\nPhe-induced breakdown of self-tolerance requires a T cell response mediated by the nitrophenyl group, and is consistent with previous studies which showed that a Tyr86Phe TNFÎ± mutant is not able to elicit a strong immune response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne question regarding the mechanism of pNO\n2\nPhe-induced breakdown of self-tolerance is whether the antibody response is directed at the epitope that contains pNO\n2\nPhe, or whether epitope spreading occurs, resulting in a polyclonal IgG response against multiple epitopes in the target protein. To address this issue, Bcl-2 mice were immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± to generate 50 B cell hybridomas, which were screened by ELISA to identify those clones that produced antibodies against WT mTNFÎ±. We then assessed the binding of these monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to a set of three mTNFÎ± fragments that were expressed in \nE. coli \nand whose molecular weights were verified by MALDI TOF (\nFIG. 21\n): an N-terminal fragment (aa 1-60), an internal fragment (aa 61-100), and a C-terminal fragment (aa 101-156). Although this assay largely detects specificities against linear (presumably continuous) B cell epitopes, we identified five mAbs (3L24, 5K19, 6J22, 701, and 7F23) that bound the N-terminal fragment and one mAb (1P19) that bound the C-terminal fragment (\nFIG. 22\n). Significantly, none of the mAbs bound the internal fragment encoding pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nin the original immunogen. Thus, antibodies binding more than one epitope are produced through pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± immunization, and these epitopes do not necessarily include the pNO\n2\nPhe residue of the immunogen. The polyclonal IgGs from pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±-immunized mice cross-react with native mTNFÎ± with Kd values in the nanomolar range (\nFIG. 16B\n). Together, these results further support the hypothesis that a cross-reactive neutralizing antibody response can be generated against a self-protein by simply inserting a pNO\n2\nPhe residue into its sequence.\n\n\n \nSustainability of pNO\n2\nPhe-Induced Antibody Response\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine the durability of anti-mTNFÎ± IgG antibody titers, we immunized three Bcl-2 mice with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±. After the last boost injection, bleeds were analyzed by ELISA against pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± at defined time points. Remarkably, antibody levels were maintained at greater than 80% their initial levels for at least 40 weeks (\nFIG. 16C\n), after which time the mice were sacrificed. In contrast, in a previous anti-mTNFÎ± vaccination study based on immunization with mTNFÎ± mutant containing a hen egg-white lysozyme T-cell epitope, titers declined four weeks after the last boost, and after 26 weeks the mTNFÎ± antibody titers had dropped by 80-87% (Dalum, et al. (1999) âTherapeutic antibodies elicited by immunization against TNF-alpha.â \nNat Biotechnol \n17: 666-669). Thus, our pNO\n2\nPhe-based vaccine strategy is effective in inducing persistent immunity and long-term protection against TNFÎ± as a disease-associated self-antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExtension to Mutations at Other Surface Sites within mTNFÎ±\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo examine the generality of the pNO\n2\nPhe-induced breakdown of self-tolerance, four additional surface-exposed residues of mTNFÎ± were mutated to pNO\n2\nPhe: Lys\n11\n, Gln\n21\n, Asp\n42\n, and Val\n49 \n(\nFIG. 23A\n). These residues are also structurally distinct from p-nitrophenylalanine. After confirming the composition and homogeneity of pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n21 \nmTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ±, and pNO\n2\nPhe\n49 \nmTNFÎ± by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry (\nFIG. 23B\n and Table 3), the quaternary structure of these mutant proteins was shown to be trimeric by size exclusion chromatography (Table 4). Furthermore, an NFÎºB-luciferase reporter gene assay showed that pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ± has 9%, pNO\n2\nPhe\n21 \nmTNFÎ± has 22%, pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± has 22%, and pNO\n2\nPhe\n49 \nmTNFÎ± has 10% of the activity of WT mTNFÎ± (Table 4 and \nFIG. 23C\n). All mutants are therefore significantly more active than the previously characterized pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, which has only 2% of the activity of the wild-type protein in this assay. To determine the immunogenicity of these pNO\n2\nPhe mTNFÎ± mutants, fourteen C57BL/6 mice were randomized into five groups and injected with these mutants, or WT mTNFÎ± by the RIMMS (repetitive immunization at multiple sites) protocol (Kilpatrick, et al. (1997) âRapid development of affinity matured monoclonal antibodies using RIMMS.â \nHybridoma \n16: 381-389). An ELISA analysis revealed no correlation between mTNFÎ± activity in the NFÎºB-luciferase reporter gene assay and the ability to induce an antibody response, ruling out a direct effect on the immune system. As shown in FIG. \n17\n, pNO\n2\nPhe at \nposition\n 11 induced a high titer IgG response to WT mTNFÎ±, equivalent to that against the pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ± immunogen. In contrast, although mutations of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 21, 42, and 49 also yielded high titer IgG responses against the pNO\n2\nPhe-containing immunogen, the IgG antibodies had only moderate cross-reactivity to WT mTNFÎ±. Antibodies generated against all four mutant TNFÎ±s were then used for passive immunization of forty C57BL/6 mice, which were randomized into five groups and injected with the anti-pNO\n2\nPhe or anti-WT mTNFÎ± IgG. Twenty-four hours after passive immunization, the animals were challenged with LPS as described previously (Niessen, et al. (2008) âDendritic cell PAR1-S1P3 signalling couples coagulation and inflammation.â \nNature \n452: 654-658). All mice receiving anti-pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ± IgG survived the lethal LPS challenge (\nFIG. 18\n). Even the other groups receiving moderately cross-reactive anti-pNO\n2\nPhe\n21 \nmTNFÎ± IgG, anti-pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± IgG, and anti-pNO\n2\nPhe\n49 \nmTNFÎ± IgG had survival rates of at least 75%; whereas mice injected with anti-WT mTNFÎ± IgG showed a survival rate of only 13%. Thus, the ability to break self-tolerance using pNO\n2\nPhe is not dependent on a single amino acid position, since we have shown that at least five positions (including position 86) can induce a neutralizing cross-reactive anti-mTNFÎ± IgG response in vivo. Moreover, the site of substitution does not need to be structurally similar to p-nitrophenylalanine.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nESI mass spectrometry analysis of mRBP4 variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nObserved mass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(calculated mass), Da\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFull-length\n\n\nProtein\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample\n\n\nMethod\n\n\nprotein\n\n\nwithout Mat\n1\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\npNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ±\n\n\nMALDI TOF\n\n\n19178 (19232)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\npNO\n2\nPhe\n21 \nmTNFÎ±\n\n\nMALDI TOF\n\n\n19191 (19232)\n\n\n\n\n\n\npNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ±\n\n\nMALDI TOF\n\n\n19222 (19245)\n\n\n\n\n\n\npNO\n2\nPhe\n49 \nmTNFÎ±\n\n\nMALDI TOF\n\n\n19249 (19261)\n\n\n\n\n\n\npNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nMRBP4\n\n\nESI\n\n\n23710 (23710)\n\n\n23579 (23579)\n\n\n\n\n\n\npNO\n2\nPhe\n108 \nMRBP4\n\n\nESI\n\n\n23710 (23710)\n\n\n23579 (23579)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWT mRBP4\n\n\nESI\n\n\nn.d.

Specifically, we examined the ability of pNO\n2\nPhe to break self-tolerance against another model self-protein found in serum, RBP4 (Zanotti, et al. (2004) âPlasma retinol-binding protein: structure and interactions with retinol, retinoids, and transthyretin.â \nVitam Horm \n69: 271-295; Raghu, et al. (2004) âInteractions amongst plasma retinol-binding protein, transthyretin and their ligands: implications in vitamin A homeostasis and transthyretin amyloidosis.â \nBiochim Biophys Acta \n1703: 1-9). In contrast to TNFÎ±, this is a highly soluble, relatively low molecular weight (20 kDa), monomeric protein. RBP4 knockout mice show no apparent phenotypic abnormalities other than visual deficiency (Vogel, et al. (2002) âRetinol-binding protein-deficient mice: biochemical basis for impaired vision.â \nBiochemistry \n41: 15360-15368), suggesting that mice will survive a neutralizing immune response against self-RBP4. Based on the x-ray crystal structure of monomeric human RBP4 (Cowan, et al. (1990) âCrystallographic refinement of human serum retinol binding protein at 2A resolution.â \nProteins \n8: 44-61), we selected the following surface-exposed residues for mutation to pNO\n2\nPhe: Tyr\n43 \nand Tyr\n108 \n(\nFIG. 24\n). These residues are highly conserved among different mammalian RBP4s, including murine RBP4 (mRBP4). These mRBP4 mutants as well as WT mRBP4 were expressed in \nE. coli \nas N-terminal His6-tagged proteins, purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions, and refolded according to a previously described protocol (Greene, et al. (2001) âRole of conserved residues in structure and stability: tryptophans of human serum retinol-binding protein, a model for the lipocalin superfamily.â \nProtein Sci \n10: 2301-2316). The site-specific incorporation of pNO\n2\nPhe into mRBP4 at positions 43 and 108 was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis, as well as by MS/MS fragmentation of the tryptic fragments containing the unnatural amino acid (\nFIGS. 24\n, \n25\n and \n27\n). Analytical size-exclusion chromatography indicated a monomeric structure for all mRBP4 proteins, which is in agreement with the published quaternary structure of human RBP4 (Table 5) (Cowan, et al. (1990) âCrystallographic refinement of human serum retinol binding protein at 2A resolution.â \nProteins \n8: 44-61). Moreover, according to a retinol displacement assay, all pNO\n2\nPhe mRBP4 mutants bind retinol with Kd values in the nanomolar range, which is in good agreement with WT mRBP4 (Table 5).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTABLE 5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nQuaternary structure determination and retinol binding affinities\n \n \n \nof mRBP4 proteins.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSample\n \nObserved mass\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRetention time\n \n(calculated mass of\n \n \n \nSample\n \n(min)\n \nmonomer) (kDa)\n \nKd (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4\n \n42.63\n \n9.6 (23.7)\n \n191.4\n \n \n \npNO\n2\nPhe\n108 \nmRBP4\n \n41.84\n \n10.9 (23.7)â\n \n229.5\n \n \n \nWT mRBP4\n \n42.51\n \n9.8 (23.7)\n \n170.8\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe quaternary structures of pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4, pNO\n2\nPhe\n108 \nmRBP4, and WT mRBP4 were determined based on a plot of the logarithm of the molecular mass of the protein standards versus the retention time on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column. The binding affinities of mRBP4 proteins were determined by a TR-FRET retinol binding assay.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerality of pNO2Phe-Induced Breakdown of Self-Tolerance\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo determine the immunogenicity of the pNO\n2\nPhe mRBP4 mutants, twelve Bcl2 mice were randomized into four groups and injected with pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4, pNO\n2\nPhe\n108 \nmRBP4, and WT mRBP4 by the RIMMS protocol. (See, e.g., Kilpatrick, et al. (1997) âRapid development of affinity matured monoclonal antibodies using RIMMS.â \nHybridoma \n16: 381-389). According to ELISA analysis, mice immunized with either WT mRBP4 or pNO\n2\nPhe\n108 \nmRBP4 had insignificant serum IgG titers against WT mRBP4 (\nFIG. 19A\n). In contrast, mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4 were found to display markedly high serum IgG titers (up to 1:100,000), binding both the pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4 immunogen and the wild-type protein. Similar results were obtained with C57BL/6 mice (\nFIG. 26\n). Furthermore, in accordance with previous observations with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, CD4\n+\n T cells specific for pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4 were induced upon immunization with pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4 protein, indicating a mature T cell-dependent immune response (\nFIG. 19B\n). Together, these results further support the hypothesis that the introduction of pNO\n2\nPhe into a protein sequence can create a strong T cell epitope, which initiates a sustained cross-reactive IgG antibody response. Not all sites lead to a strong cross-reactive immune response, which is not surprising since it is unlikely that all sites correspond to potential T cell epitopes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWe have shown that the genetic introduction of pNO\n2\nPhe leads to sustained IgG antibody responses against the self-proteins mTNFÎ± and mRBP4. In terms of mechanism, incorporation of the p-nitrophenyl group at a single position results 10 in T cells that can only be stimulated by the pNO2Phe mutant but not the WT protein. This pNO\n2\nPhe-induced T cell-dependent response ultimately leads to activation of autoreactive B cells and the production of polyclonal antibodies that are highly cross-reactive to the native self-protein. These results are comparable to recent studies showing that post-translationally modified proteins can enhance T cell responsiveness (Cantaert, et al. (2006) âCitrullinated proteins in rheumatoid arthritis: crucial . . . but not sufficient!â \nArthritis Rheum \n54: 3381-3389; Backlund, et al. (2002) âPredominant selection of T cells specific for the glycosylated collagen type II epitope (263-270) in humanized transgenic mice and in rheumatoid arthritis.â \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n99: 9960-9965; Dzhambazov, et al. (2005) âThe major T cell epitope on type II collagen is glycosylated in normal cartilage but modified by arthritis in both rats and humansâ \nEur J Immunol \n35: 357-366). For example, citrullination and glycosylation are post-translational modifications involved in T cell-dependent autoimmune diseases (Cantaert, et al. (2006) âCitrullinated proteins in rheumatoid arthritis: crucial . . . but not sufficient!â \nArthritis Rheum \n54: 3381-3389; Backlund, et al. (2002) âPredominant selection of T cells specific for the glycosylated collagen type II epitope (263-270) in humanized transgenic mice and in rheumatoid arthritis.â \nProc Nall Acad Sci USA \n99: 9960-9965; Dzhambazov, et al.

(2008) âImmunity to citrullinated proteins in rheumatoid arthritis.â \nAnnu Rev Immunol \n26: 651-675; Sollid, L. M. (2000) âMolecular basis of celiac disease.â \nAnnu Rev Immunol \n18: 53-81). Similarly, dinitrofluorobenzene modification of skin antigens has been used for decades as a model of the T cell response in contact hypersensitivity (Toews, et al. (1980) âEpidermal Langerhans cell density determines whether contact hypersensitivity or unresponsiveness follows skin painting with DNFB.â \nJ Immunol \n124: 445-453). Site-specific incorporation of pNO\n2\nPhe into self-proteins therefore establishes a simple model system to biochemically mimic post-translationally or chemically mediated loss of self-tolerance. This methodology should therefore also help to understand how the immune system responds to chemically modified antigens during autoimmunity. Furthermore, pNO\n2\nPhe-induced breakdown of self-tolerance should not only afford a robust method for raising neutralizing antibodies against pathogenic self proteins associated with cancer or degenerative diseases, it can also be applicable to weakly immunogenic foreign antigens of infectious agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBacterial Strains and Reagents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nE. coli \nXL1-Blue and XL10-Gold were used as hosts for cloning, and \nE. coli \nBL21(DE3) was used as an expression strain. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, dNTPs, and factor Xa protease were obtained from NEB (Beverly, Mass.). Primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, Iowa). Plasmid DNA preparation was carried out with PureLinkâ¢ Quick Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Invitrogen), and DNA purification after restriction digestion was performed using PureLinkâ¢ PCR Micro Kit (Invitrogen).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProduction of pNO\n2\nPhe-Containing mTNFÎ± and WT mTNFÎ±\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWT mTNFÎ± and pNO\n2\nPhe mTNFÎ± mutants were produced as previously described (Grunewald, J. et al. (2008) âImmunochemical termination of self-tolerance.â \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n105: 11276-11280). Briefly, site-specific incorporation of pNO\n2\nPhe into the murine TNFÎ± gene was carried out by introducing TAG amber codons using standard PCR mutagenesis procedures. To express pNO\n2\nPhe mTNFÎ± mutants, \nE. coli \nBL21(DE3) cells were cotransformed with mutNO\n2\nPheRS, mutRNA\nCUA \nand the mutated mTNFÎ± gene. The transformed cells were then grown in the presence of 1 mM pNO\n2\nPhe (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, Mass.) in minimal medium containing 1% glycerol and 0.3 mM leucine (GMML medium) at 37Â° C. and protein expression was initiated by the addition of 1 mM IPTG. WT mTNFÎ± was expressed in 2ÃYT medium in the absence of pNO\n2\nPhe. Protein purification was carried out by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) under either native or denaturing conditions. All proteins were characterized by MALDI-TOF or ESI mass spectrometry. Successful incorporation of pNO\n2\nPhe into mutant proteins was also verified by tryptic in-gel digestion and subsequent MS/MS fragmentation of the respective tryptic fragment containing this unnatural amino acid. Protein quaternary structures were analyzed by analytical SEC on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL gel filtration column, which was calibrated by a molecular weight gel-filtration standard from Bio-Rad (Bio-Rad Labs, Hercules, Calif.). The activity of pNO\n2\nPhe mTNFÎ± mutants was determined by an NFÎºB-luciferase reporter gene assay using HEK293 cells stably expressing NFÎºB-luciferase as described previously (Grunewald, J. et al. (2008) âImmunochemical termination of self-tolerance.â \nProc Natl Acad Sci USA \n105: 11276-11280).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConstruction of mRBP4 Expression Vector, pSpeedET-mRBP4\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cDNA encoding murine RBP4 (aa 19-201) (Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation) was amplified with PCR using two primers designed specifically for the Polymerase Incomplete Primer Extension (PIPE) cloning method (Klock, et al.

The pSpeedET vector was amplified using a 5â² \nvector reverse primer\n 5â²-\nGCCCTGGAAGTACA\nGGTTTTCGTGATGATGATGATGATG and a 3â² \nvector forward primer\n 5â²-TAACGCGACTTAATTAACTCGTTTAAACGGTCTCCAGC. The underlined and italicized bases highlight the two distinct complementary regions between primers where annealing occurs. The pSpeedET vector appends an N-terminal His6-tag sequence (MGSDKLHHEIHHH), followed by a TEV protease site (ENLYFQG) immediately before the 19th codon for mRBP4. The unpurified mRBP4 (aa 19-201) insert PCR product was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with the unpurified pSpeedET vector PCR product. After mixing, \nE. coli \nXL10-Gold cells were transformed with 2 Î¼L of the reaction mixture. Site-specific incorporation of pNO\n2\nPhe into mRBP4 (aa 19-201) was performed by mutating the codons for Tyr43 or Tyr108 to a TAG amber codon. The sequences of all pSpeedET-mRBP4 constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein Expression and Purification of pNO2Phe mRBP4 and WT mRBP4\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo express the pNOPhe mRBP4 mutants, \nE. coli \nBL21(DE3) cells were cotransformed with mutNO\n2\nPheRS, mutRNA\nCUA\n, and the respective mutant mRBP4 gene. The transformed strains were grown at 37Â° C. in the presence of 1 mM pNO\n2\nPhe in GMML medium, induced with 0.2% (w/v) arabinose when the OD\n600 \nreached 0.5, and harvested after 12-16 h. In contrast to the pNO\n2\nPhe mRBP4 mutants, WT mRBP4 was expressed in 2ÃYT medium in the absence of pNO\n2\nPhe for 3 h. The cell pellets were suspended in 8 M urea containing 100 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and lysed by sonication on ice for 3 minutes. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 40,000Ãg for 25 min. 5 \nml\n 50% Ni-NTA slurry (Novagen, Madison, Wis.) was added to the supernatant and mixed gently by shaking for 60 minutes. The Ni-NTA beads were washed with 8 M urea, 100 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, and 10 mM Tris (pH 6.3). Elution was carried out with 8 M urea containing 100 mM NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n, and 10 mM Tris (pH 4.5). The protein was concentrated with a 10K molecular mass cut-off Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore, Bedford, Mass.). The mRBP4 protein was precipitated by dialysis against phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), and redissolved in 8 M urea containing 20 mM Tris and 20 mM dithiothreitol (pH 8.0). In vitro folding of mRBP4 protein was performed according to Greene, et al. (2001) âRole of conserved residues in structure and stability: tryptophans of human serum retinol-binding protein, a model for the lipocalin superfamily.â Protein Sci 10: 2301-2316. Briefly, native protein was generated by adding the denatured material in 8 M urea dropwise to folding buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 10 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM 2-hydroxyethyldisulfide, and 1% glycerol (pH 8.5) at a rate of Ë30 drops/minute. Folding was allowed to proceed for 16 h at 4Â° C., and the protein solution was then concentrated using a 10K molecular mass cut-off Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore). The protein was further purified by SEC on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.) equilibrated with PBS (pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/minute.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMouse Model of Severe Systemic Inflammation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Animal Protection Guidelines and were approved by The Scripps Research Institute Animal Care and Use Committee. Animal experiments were performed in a room with alternating 12 h light dark cycles under stable conditions of temperature (20-22Â° C.) and relative humidity (40-60%) (Niessen, et al. (2008) âDendritic cell PAR1-S1P3 signalling couples coagulation and inflammation.â Nature 452: 654-658). Twenty four hours before LPS challenge, 9-week old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, Me.) were passively immunized by injection into the left half of the peritoneal cavity with 4 mg/kg of IgG purified from serum of mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n21 \nmTNFÎ±, pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ±, and pNO\n2\nPhe\n49 \nmTNFÎ± IgG derived from non-immunized wild-type mice was employed as a negative control. Mice were then injected into the right half of the peritoneal cavity under 2% isoflurane with 7.5 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS, \nE. coli \nO111:B4 Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, Calif.). For statistical analysis, Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted and survival differences were analyzed using a log rank test with Bonferroni correction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nElisa\n\n\n \n \n \n \n30 Î¼l of 0.5 Î¼g/ml protein was used to coat the wells of Maxisorp 384-well plates (Nunc, Rochester, N.Y.) overnight at 4Â° C. After washing with PBS+0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), the coated plates were blocked with 80 Î¼l of 1% BSA in PBS, and washed again with PBST. The plates were sequentially incubated with 20 Î¼l of primary antibody or serum diluted in 1% BSA in PBS, 20 Î¼l of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-mouse IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, Pa.), and 20 Î¼l of TMB substrate (KPL, Gaithersburg, Md.), and read at an absorbance of 650 nm. Between incubations, the plates were washed at least six times with PBST.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nT Cell Proliferation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIsolation of CD4\n+\n T cells from the lymph nodes of immunized C57BL/6 mice was carried out by magnetic depletion with MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, Calif.). T cells were then placed into culture with irradiated splenocytes from naÃ¯ve C57BL/6 mice and increasing amounts of antigen. Following incubation for 48 h, the cultures were incubated with \n3\nH-thymidine overnight. After harvesting the culture plates onto filter mats, radioactivity was quantified with a TopCount scintillation counter (PerkinElmer, Boston, Mass.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMurine RBP4 Activity Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWT and pNO\n2\nPhe mRBP4 mutant proteins were labeled with biotin using the Sulfo-NHS-Biotin kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.) according to manufacturer instructions. For determination of retinol binding activity, 10 nM biotin-labeled RBP4 was mixed with 1 nM Streptavidin-Europium chelate (LANCEÂ® Eu-W8044 Streptavidin, Perkin Elmer, Foster City, Calif.). Increasing concentrations of Cy5-labeled retinol were added to the reaction and retinol binding was assessed by homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunization and Generation of Monoclonal Antibody (mAb)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurified WT or pNO\n2\nPhe mTNFÎ± was used as immunogen to produce anti-mTNFÎ± antibodies. Bcl-2 transgenic mice (C57BL/6-TgN(BCL2)22Wehi) or C57BL/6 mice were immunized using the RIMMS protocol. See, e.g., Kilpatrick, et al. (1997) âRapid development of affinity matured monoclonal antibodies using RIMMS.â \nHybridoma \n16: 381-389. Bcl-2 transgenic mice demonstrate extended B cell survival and follicular lymphoproliferation making them especially suitable for immunization._Briefly, mice were injected 8 times over 18 days. In each injection, 5 Î¼g of protein in 200 Î¼l PBS was 1:1 mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant (first injection) or with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (for the remaining injections). Immunogen was injected at 6 specific sites proximal to peripheral lymph nodes (PLNs). On the day of the 8th injection, a test bleed was collected, and the serum antibody titer was analyzed by ELISA. PLNs from a high serum titer mouse were harvested and dissociated. The isolated lymphocytes were fused to F0 mouse myeloma cells using 50% PEG 1500. Fused cells were plated in a 384-well tissue culture plate. Hybridomas were selected in hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine (HAT) medium and screened by ELISA against WT mTNFÎ±.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExplanation of Results Depicted in Figures of Example 2\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 16\n shows the results of experiments that were performed to determine whether pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± immunization promotes class-switching to an IgG response. The IgG response that was detected displays significant cross-reactivity with WT mTNFÎ± and lasts for at least 40 weeks in mice. In \nFIG. 16A\n, serum titers for Bcl-2 mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± or WT mTNFÎ± were determined over a period of 17 days in the presence of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) for the initial injection and incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) for the remainder. ELISAs were measured against WT mTNFÎ± using either anti-mouse IgM (first and second bars in each group of four bars) or anti-mouse IgG (third and fourth bars in each group of four bars) as a secondary antibody. Before measurement, serum samples were diluted 1:100 (first and third bars) or 1:1,000 (second and fourth bars) with 1% BSA in PBS buffer. \nFIG. 16B\n shows ELISA titrations that were performed to quantify the affinity of polyclonal anti-WT mTNFÎ± IgG (inverted triangles) and polyclonal anti-pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± IgG (diamonds) for either pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± or WT mTNFÎ±. \nFIG. 16C\n shows serum titer durability study of three Bcl-2 mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±. After a sequence of eight immunizations, bleeds were taken for 20 ELISA analysis against pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± at defined time points (Ît corresponds to the time period between the last immunization and the bleed). Before each measurement, serum samples were diluted 1:100 with 1% BSA in PBS buffer. The first bar in each group of 7 bars is prebleed, the second bar is Î19 weeks, the third bar is Î23 weeks, the fourth bar is Î28 weeks, the fifth bar is Î32 weeks, the sixth bar is Î36 weeks, and the seventh bar is Î40 weeks.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther surface-exposed sites on mTNFÎ± are also significantly immunogenic. In \nFIG. 17A\n, serum titers against WT mTNFÎ± (left bars in each pair of bars), pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ± (right bars in \n \npairs\n \n 3, 4, and 5), and PBS (right bars in \npairs\n 1 and 2) for C57BL/6 mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ± or WT mTNFÎ± are shown. In \nFIG. 17B\n, serum titers against WT mTNFÎ± (left bars in each pair of bars), pNO\n2\nPhe\n21 \nmTNFÎ± (right bars in \n \npairs\n \n 6, 7, and 8), and PBS (right bars in \npairs\n 1 and 2) for C57BL/6 mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n21 \nmTNFÎ± or WT mTNFÎ± are shown. In \nFIG. 17C\n, serum titers against WT mTNFÎ± (left bars in each pair of bars), pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± (right bars in \n \npairs\n \n 9, 10, and 11), and PBS (right bars in \npairs\n 1 and 2) for C57BL/6 mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± or WT mTNFÎ± are shown. In \nFIG. 17D\n, serum titers against WT mTNFÎ± (left bars in each pair of bars), pNO\n2\nPhe\n49 \nmTNFÎ± (right bars in \n \npairs\n \n 12, 13, and 14), and PBS right bars in \npairs\n 1 and 2) for C57BL/6 mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n49 \nmTNFÎ± or WT mTNFÎ± are shown. Before each measurement, serum samples were diluted (17A) 1/800; (17B) 1/200; (17C) 1/200; or (17D) 1/200 with 1% BSA in PBS buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results indicate that pNO\n2\nPhe at \nposition\n 11 induced a high titer IgG response to WT mTNFÎ±, equivalent to that against the pNO\n2\nPhe\n11\nmTNFÎ± immunogen. In contrast, although mutations of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 21, 42, and 49 also yielded high titer IgG responses against the pNO\n2\nPhe-containing immunogen, the IgG antibodies had only moderate cross-reactivity to WT mTNFÎ±.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 18\n shows that there exists a significant survival benefit for mice immunized with various pNO\n2\nPhe mTNFÎ± mutants after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. In \nFIG. 18A\n, Male C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with 4 mg/kg purified IgG from mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ± and pNO\n2\nPhe\n49 \nmTNFÎ± one day before LPS challenge. In \nFIG. 18B\n, the mice were intraperitoneally injected with 4 mg/kg purified IgG from mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n21 \nmTNFÎ± and pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± one day before LPS challenge. Kaplan-Meier survival plots of these mice were compared to mice injected with control IgG (n=8/group). Survival advantage of mice immunized with each modified TNF p<0.01 versus control, log rank test with Bonferroni correction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll mice receiving anti-pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ± IgG survived the lethal LPS challenge. Even the other groups receiving moderately cross-reactive anti-pNO\n2\nPhe\n21 \nmTNFÎ± IgG, anti-pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± IgG, and anti-pNO\n2\nPhe\n49 \nmTNFÎ± IgG had survival rates of at least 75%; whereas mice injected with anti-WT mTNFÎ± IgG showed a survival rate of only 13%. Thus, the ability to break self-tolerance using pNO\n2\nPhe is not dependent on a single amino acid position\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 19\n depicts the results of experiments that show the loss of tolerance to a second self-antigen, mRBP4. Serum titers for Bcl-2 mice immunized with WT mRBP4 (19A); pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4 (19B); pNO\n2\nPhe\n108 \nmRBP4 (19C), are shown. ELISAs were measured against WT mRBP4 (single bars in 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9; left bars in each pair of \n \nbars\n \n 4, 5, and 6) and pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4 (right bars in each pair of \n \nbars\n \n 4, 5, and 6). Before measurement, serum samples were diluted 1:1,000 with 1% BSA in PBS buffer. \nFIG. 19B\n depicts results that show the proliferation of CD4\n+\n T cells from C57BL/6 mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4 and stimulated in vitro with serial dilutions of pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccording to the ELISA analyses in \nFIG. 19\n, mice immunized with either WT mRBP4 or pNO\n2\nPhe\n108 \nmRBP4 had insignificant serum IgG titers against WT mRBP4. In contrast, mice immunized with pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4 were found to display markedly high serum IgG titers (up to 1:100,000), binding both the pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4 immunogen and the wild-type protein\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 20\n shows that WT mTNFÎ± cannot sustain pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± induced loss of tolerance. Serum titers for Bcl-2 mice immunized by the RIMMS protocol with WT mTNFÎ± (20A), pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (20B), and pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± followed by WT mTNFÎ± (20C). For (20C), the immunization involved one initial injection of pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± in CFA and seven subsequent injections of WT mTNFÎ± in IFA. Before ELISA measurements, serum samples were diluted 1:1,000 with 1% BSA in PBS buffer. ELISAs were measured against WT mTNFÎ± (left bars in each pair of bars) or pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (right bars in each pair of bars). In contrast to pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, WT mTNFÎ± cannot sustain significant titers of cross-reactive anti-mTNFÎ± antibodies. This result supports the notion that pNO\n2\nPhe-induced breakdown of self-tolerance requires a T cell response mediated by the nitrophenyl group\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 21\n shows the results of mass spectrometric analyses of three mTNFÎ± fragments. \nFIG. 21A\n shows MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of N-terminal fragment mTNFÎ± (aa 1-60); calc. mass, 7776.51. \nFIG. 21B\n shows MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of internal fragment mTNFÎ± (aa 61-100); calc. mass, 5597.36. \nFIG. 21C\n shows MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of C-terminal fragment mTNFÎ± (aa 101-156); calc. mass, 7388.18. The peaks in each panel in \nFIG. 21\n confirm that each of the TNFÎ± fragments are the expected mass.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExperiments were performed to determine the binding of anti-mTNFÎ± mAbs to three mTNFÎ± fragments. In \nFIG. 22\n, ELISAs were measured against WT mTNFÎ± aa 1-156 (first bars in each group of four bars) or WT mTNFÎ± aa 1-60 (second bars in each group of four bars), WT mTNFÎ± aa 61-100 (third bars in each group of four bars), and WT mTNFÎ± aa 101-156 (fourth bars in each group of four bars). Fifty hybridomas that secreted anti-mTNFÎ± IgG were generated from pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±-immunized mice. Three fragments of mTNFÎ± were expressed and purified from \nE. coli\n: an N-terminal fragment (aa 1-60), an internal fragment (aa 61-100), and a C-terminal fragment (aa 101-156). Note that the pNO\n2\nPhe is encoded at position 86 (internal fragment) in the original immunogen. ELISA analysis was performed using each fragment and WT mTNFÎ± as a control. Antibodies that bind one of the fragments are marked: square, N-terminal fragment; asterisk, C-terminal fragment). Only six mAbs were found to clearly recognize one fragment. One mAb (6G17) recognized all three and likely represents non-specific binding activity. Of note, none of the 50 mAbs recognize a linear epitope corresponding to the middle fragment, which is the region that contains the pNO\n2\nPhe in the mutant TNFÎ±.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 23\n shows the results of experiments performed to determine whether pNO\n2\nPhe was incorporated into surface-exposed sites of mTNFÎ±. \nFIG. 23A\n provides a schematic of a X-ray crystal structure of mTNFÎ± trimer with Lys\n11\n, Gln\n21\n, Asp\n42\n, Val\n49\n, and Tyr\n86 \nindicated (PDB ID code 2TNF)\n30\n.

Protein samples were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography under native conditions and analyzed by SDS PAGE with Coomassie G-250 staining. \nFIG. 23C\n provides the results of NF-ÎºB-luciferase activity analysis of WT mTNFÎ± (small squares), pNO\n2\nPhe\n11 \nmTNFÎ± (triangles), pNO\n2\nPhe\n21 \nmTNFÎ± (hollow diamonds), pNO\n2\nPhe\n42 \nmTNFÎ± (filled diamonds), pNO\n2\nPhe\n49 \nmTNFÎ± (circles), and pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ± (large squares). All mutants are therefore significantly more active than the previously characterized pNO\n2\nPhe\n86 \nmTNFÎ±, which has only 2% of the activity of the wild-type protein in this assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 24\n shows the results of experiments performed to confirm the site-specific insertion of pNO\n2\nPhe into surface sites of mRBP4. \nFIG. 24A\n provides a schematic of a X-ray crystal structure of human RBP4 with Tyr\n43 \nand Tyr\n108 \nindicated (PDB ID code 1RBP)\n21\n.

These results show that pNO\n2\nPhe is incorporated into the mRBP mutants with high specificity. Protein samples were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie G-250 staining. \nLane\n 5 contains WT mRBP4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nFIG. 25\n, MS/MS analyses of tryptic fragments of pNO\n2\nPhe\n43 \nmRBP4 and pNO\n2\nPhe\n108 \nmRBP4 match the patterns for the incorporation of pNO\n2\nPhe. \nFIG. 25A\n shows a tandem mass spectrum of the undecamer fragment FSGLWXAIAKK, where X denotes pNO\n2\nPhe.

No. 11/836,318, filed Aug. 9, 2007, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/837,197, filed Aug. 11, 2006, which is incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates generally to IL-17A specific binding compounds, such as antibodies, and uses thereof. More specifically, the invention relates to chimeric and humanized antibodies that recognize human IL-17A and modulate its activity, particularly in inflammatory, autoimmune and proliferative disorders.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe immune system functions to protect individuals from infective agents, e.g., bacteria, multi-cellular organisms, and viruses, as well as from cancers. This system includes several types of lymphoid and myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), eosinophils, T cells, B cells, and neutrophils. These lymphoid and myeloid cells often produce signaling proteins known as cytokines. The immune response includes inflammation, i.e., the accumulation of immune cells systemically or in a particular location of the body. In response to an infective agent or foreign substance, immune cells secrete cytokines which, in turn, modulate immune cell proliferation, development, differentiation, or migration. Immune response can produce pathological consequences, e.g., when it involves excessive inflammation, as in the autoimmune disorders (see, e.g., Abbas et al. (eds.) (2000) \nCellular and Molecular Immunology\n, W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, Pa.; Oppenheim and Feldmann (eds.) (2001) \nCytokine Reference\n, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.; von Andrian and Mackay (2000) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n343:1020-1034; Davidson and Diamond (2001) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n345:340-350).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInterleukin-17A (IL-17A; also known as Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-associated Antigen 8 (CTLA8), IL-17) is a homodimeric cytokine produced by memory T cells following antigen recognition. The development of such T cells is promoted by interleukin-23 (IL-23). McKenzie et al. (2006) \nTrends Immunol. \n27(1): 17-23; Langrish et al. (2005) \nJ. Exp. Med. \n201(2):233-40. IL-17A acts through two receptors, IL-17RA and IL-17RC to induce the production of numerous molecules involved in neutrophil biology, inflammation, and organ destruction. This cytokine synergizes with tissue necrosis factor (TNF) and or interleukin 1Î² (IL-1Î²) to promote a greater pro-inflammatory environment. Antagonizing the activity of IL-17A with antibodies or antigen binding fragments of antibodies has been proposed for the treatment of a variety of inflammatory, immune and proliferative disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis osteoporosis, inflammatory fibrosis (e.g. scleroderma, lung fibrosis, and cirrhosis), gingivitis, periodontitis or other inflammatory periodontal diseases, inflammatory bowel disorders (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease), asthma (including allergic asthma), allergies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and cancer. (See, e.g., US 2003/0166862, WO 2005/108616, WO 2005/051422, and WO 2006/013107).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most significant limitation in using antibodies as a therapeutic agent in vivo is the immunogenicity of the antibodies. As most monoclonal antibodies are derived from rodents, repeated use in humans results in the generation of an immune response against the therapeutic antibody, e.g., human against mouse antibodies or HAMA. Such an immune response results in a loss of therapeutic efficacy at a minimum and a potential fatal anaphylactic response at a maximum. Initial efforts to reduce the immunogenicity of rodent antibodies involved the production of chimeric antibodies, in which mouse variable regions (Fv) were fused with human constant regions. Liu et al. (1987) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n84:3439-43. However, mice injected with hybrids of human variable regions and mouse constant regions develop a strong anti-antibody response directed against the human variable region, suggesting that the retention of the entire rodent Fv region in such chimeric antibodies may still result in unwanted immunogenicity in patients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is generally believed that complementarity determining region (CDR) loops of variable domains comprise the binding site of antibody molecules. Therefore, the grafting of rodent CDR loops onto human frameworks (i.e., humanization) has been attempted to further minimize rodent sequences. Jones et al. (1986) \nNature \n321:522; Verhoeyen et al. (1988) \nScience \n239:1534. However, CDR loop exchanges still do not uniformly result in an antibody with the same binding properties as the antibody of origin. Changes in framework residues (FR), residues involved in CDR loop support, in humanized antibodies also are often required to preserve antigen binding affinity. Kabat et al. (1991) \nJ. Immunol. \n147:1709. While the use of CDR grafting and framework residue preservation in a number of humanized antibody constructs has been reported, it is difficult to predict if a particular sequence will result in the antibody with the desired binding, and sometimes biological, properties. See, e.g., Queen et al. (1989) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n86:10029, Gorman et al. (1991) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n88:4181, and Hodgson (1991) \nBiotechnology \n(NY) 9:421-5. Moreover, most prior studies used different human sequences for animal light and heavy variable sequences, rendering the predictive nature of such studies questionable. Sequences of known antibodies have been used or, more typically, those of antibodies having known X-ray crystal structures, such as antibodies NEW and KOL. See, e.g., Jones et al., supra; Verhoeyen et al., supra; and Gorman et al., supra. Exact sequence information has been reported for a few humanized constructs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe need exists for antagonists of IL-17A, such as anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies, for use in treatment of human disorders, such as inflammatory, autoimmune, and proliferative disorders. Such antagonists will preferably exhibit low immunogenicity in human subjects, allowing for repeated administration without adverse immune responses.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to anti-human IL-17A antibodies having one or more desirable properties, including high binding affinities, neutralizing activities, good pharmacokinetics and low antigenicity in human subjects.

Unless specifically defined elsewhere in this document, all other technical and scientific terms used herein have the meaning commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, including the appended claims, the singular forms of words such as âa,â âan,â and âthe,â include their corresponding plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâActivation,â âstimulation,â and âtreatment,â as it applies to cells or to receptors, may have the same meaning, e.g., activation, stimulation, or treatment of a cell or receptor with a ligand, unless indicated otherwise by the context or explicitly. âLigandâ encompasses natural and synthetic ligands, e.g., cytokines, cytokine variants, analogues, muteins, and binding compounds derived from antibodies. âLigandâ also encompasses small molecules, e.g., peptide mimetics of cytokines and peptide mimetics of antibodies. âActivationâ can refer to cell activation as regulated by internal mechanisms as well as by external or environmental factors. âResponse,â e.g., of a cell, tissue, organ, or organism, encompasses a change in biochemical or physiological behavior, e.g., concentration, density, adhesion, or migration within a biological compartment, rate of gene expression, or state of differentiation, where the change is correlated with activation, stimulation, or treatment, or with internal mechanisms such as genetic programming.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâActivityâ of a molecule may describe or refer to the binding of the molecule to a ligand or to a receptor, to catalytic activity; to the ability to stimulate gene expression or cell signaling, differentiation, or maturation; to antigenic activity, to the modulation of activities of other molecules, and the like. âActivityâ of a molecule may also refer to activity in modulating or maintaining cell-to-cell interactions, e.g., adhesion, or activity in maintaining a structure of a cell, e.g., cell membranes or cytoskeleton. âActivityâ can also mean specific activity, e.g., [catalytic activity]/[mg protein], or [immunological activity]/[mg protein], concentration in a biological compartment, or the like. âActivityâ may refer to modulation of components of the innate or the adaptive immune systems. âProliferative activityâ encompasses an activity that promotes, that is necessary for, or that is specifically associated with, e.g., normal cell division, as well as cancer, tumors, dysplasia, cell transformation, metastasis, and angiogenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâAdministrationâ and âtreatment,â as it applies to an animal, human, experimental subject, cell, tissue, organ, or biological fluid, refers to contact of an exogenous pharmaceutical, therapeutic, diagnostic agent, or composition to the animal, human, subject, cell, tissue, organ, or biological fluid. âAdministrationâ and âtreatmentâ can refer, e.g., to therapeutic, pharmacokinetic, diagnostic, research, and experimental methods. Treatment of a cell encompasses contact of a reagent to the cell, as well as contact of a reagent to a fluid, where the fluid is in contact with the cell. âAdministrationâ and âtreatmentâ also means in vitro and ex vivo treatments, e.g., of a cell, by a reagent, diagnostic, binding compound, or by another cell. âTreatment,â as it applies to a human, veterinary, or research subject, refers to therapeutic treatment, prophylactic or preventative measures, to research and diagnostic applications. âTreatmentâ as it applies to a human, veterinary, or research subject, or cell, tissue, or organ, encompasses contact of an IL-17A agonist or IL-17A antagonist to a human or animal subject, a cell, tissue, physiological compartment, or physiological fluid. âTreatment of a cellâ also encompasses situations where the IL-17A agonist or IL-17A antagonist contacts IL-17A receptor, e.g., in the fluid phase or colloidal phase, but also situations where the agonist or antagonist does not contact the cell or the receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâTreatâ or âtreatingâ means to administer a therapeutic agent, such as a composition containing any of the binding compounds of the present invention, internally or externally to a patient having one or more disease symptoms for which the agent has known therapeutic activity. Typically, the agent is administered in an amount effective to alleviate one or more disease symptoms in the treated patient or population, whether by inducing the regression of or inhibiting the progression of such symptom(s) by any clinically measurable degree. The amount of a therapeutic agent that is effective to alleviate any particular disease symptom (also referred to as the âtherapeutically effective amountâ) may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, and weight of the patient, and the ability of the drug to elicit a desired response in the patient. Whether a disease symptom has been alleviated can be assessed by any clinical measurement typically used by physicians or other skilled healthcare providers to assess the severity or progression status of that symptom. While an embodiment of the present invention (e.g., a treatment method or article of manufacture) may not be effective in alleviating the target disease symptom(s) in every patient, it should alleviate the target disease symptom(s) in a statistically significant number of patients as determined by any statistical test known in the art such as the Student's t-test, the chi\n2\n-test, the U-test according to Mann and Whitney, the Kruskal-Wallis test (H-test), Jonckheere-Terpstra-test and the Wilcoxon-test.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour variants of human IL-17A protein are referred to herein. i) As used herein, the terms âhuman IL-17Aâ and ânative human IL-17Aâ (âhuIL-17Aâ and âhumIL-17Aâ) refer to the mature forms (i.e. residues 24-155) of human IL-17A protein accession numbers NP\nâ\n002181 and AAT22064, and naturally occurring variants and polymorphisms thereof ii) As used herein, the term ârhIL-17Aâ refers to a recombinant derivative of native human IL-17A in which two additional amino acids (LE) are appended at the N-terminus of the mature form of native human IL-17A. This nomenclature is adopted for convenience in referring to various forms of IL-17A, and may not match usage in the literature. iii) As used herein, the term âFLAG-huIL-17Aâ refers to a variant of native human IL-17A having an N-terminal FLAGÂ® peptide tag appended. In some experiments the FLAG-huIL-17A is biotinylated. iv) R&D Systems human IL-17A referred to herein is residues 20-155 of human IL-17A protein accession numbers NP\nâ\n002181 and AAT22064, with an additional N-terminal methionine. Table 1 is a summary of the variant N-termini of the IL-17A molecules referenced herein.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLEâ1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariantâFormsâofâHumanâIL-17A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSEQ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIL-17AâVariant\n\n\nSequenceâ(NâC)\n\n\nNO.:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nhuIL-17Aâ(native)\n\n\nâââââââââGITIPRNâ.â.â.â\nVHHVA\n \n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\nâââââââ\nLE\nGITIPRNâ.â.â.âVHHVA\n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFLAG-huIL-17A\n\n\n \nDYKDDDDKL\nGITIPRNâ.â.â.âVHHVA\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRâ&âDâIL-17A\n\n\nââââ\nMIVKA\nGITIPRNâ.â.â.âVHHVA\n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise noted, any IL-17A used in the experiments described herein that is produced using adenoviral vectors is rhIL-17A. The term âIL-17Aâ refers to generally to human IL-17A, native or recombinant, and non-human homologs of human IL-17A. Unless otherwise indicated, molar concentrations of IL-17A are calculated using the molecular weight of a homodimer of IL-17A (e.g., 30 kDa for human IL-17A).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term âantibodyâ refers to any form of antibody that exhibits the desired biological activity. Thus, it is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers, but is not limited to, monoclonal antibodies (including full length monoclonal antibodies), polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies). As used herein, the terms âIL-17A binding fragment or âbinding fragmentâ of an antibody (the âparental antibodyâ) encompass a fragment or a derivative of an antibody, typically including at least a portion of the antigen binding or variable regions (e.g. one or more CDRs) of the parental antibody, that retains at least some of the binding specificity of the parental antibody. Examples of antibody binding fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fabâ², F(abâ²)\n2\n, and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules, e.g., sc-Fv; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Typically, a binding fragment or derivative retains at least 10% of its IL-17A binding activity when that activity is expressed on a molar basis. Preferably, a binding fragment or derivative retains at least 20%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 100% or more of the IL-17A binding affinity as the parental antibody. It is also intended that an IL-17A binding fragment can include conservative amino acid substitutions (referred to as âconservative variantsâ of the antibody) that do not substantially alter its biologic activity. The term âbinding compoundâ refers to both antibodies and binding fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âFab fragmentâ is comprised of one light chain and the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and variable regions of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of a Fab molecule cannot form a disulfide bond with another heavy chain molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn âFcâ region contains two heavy chain fragments comprising the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 domains of an antibody. The two heavy chain fragments are held together by two or more disulfide bonds and by hydrophobic interactions of the CH3 domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âFabâ² fragmentâ contains one light chain and a portion of one heavy chain that contains the V\nH \ndomain and the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 domain and also the region between the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and \nC\n \n \n \nH\n2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between the two heavy chains of two Fabâ² fragments to form a F(abâ²)\n2 \nmolecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âF(abâ²)\n2 \nfragmentâ contains two light chains and two heavy chains containing a portion of the constant region between the \nC\n \n \n \nH\n1 and C\nH\n \n2 \ndomains, such that an interchain disulfide bond is formed between the two heavy chains. A F(abâ²)\n2 \nfragment thus is composed of two Fabâ² fragments that are held together by a disulfide bond between the two heavy chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe âFv regionâ comprises the variable regions from both the heavy and light chains, but lacks the constant regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term âsingle-chain Fvâ or âscFvâ antibody refers to antibody fragments comprising the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of an antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv, see Pluckthun (1994) T\nHE \nP\nHARMACOLOGY OF \nM\nONOCLONAL \nA\nNTIBODIES\n, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315. See also, International Patent Application Publication No. WO 88/01649 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,260,203.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âdomain antibodyâ is an immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragment containing only the variable region of a heavy chain or the variable region of a light chain. In some instances, two or more V\nH \nregions are covalently joined with a peptide linker to create a bivalent domain antibody. The two V\nH \nregions of a bivalent domain antibody may target the same or different antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA âbivalent antibodyâ comprises two antigen binding sites. In some instances, the two binding sites have the same antigen specificities. However, bivalent antibodies may be bispecific (see below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, unless otherwise indicated, an âanti-IL-17Aâ antibody refers to an antibody that is raised against human IL-17A or a variant thereof, such as huIL-17A, rhIL-17A, FLAG-huIL-17A and R&D IL-17A, or any antigenic fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term âmonoclonal antibodyâ, as used herein, refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic epitope. In contrast, conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations typically include a multitude of antibodies directed against (or specific for) different epitopes. The modifier âmonoclonalâ indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. (1975) \nNature \n256: 495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The âmonoclonal antibodiesâ may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. (1991) \nNature \n352: 624-628 and Marks et al. (1991), \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222: 581-597, for example. See also Presta (2005) \nJ. Allergy Clin. Immunol. \n116:731.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include âchimericâ antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., (1984) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81: 6851-6855).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, a âchimeric antibodyâ is an antibody having the variable domain from a first antibody and constant domain from a second antibody, where the first and second antibodies are from different species. Typically the variable domains are obtained from an antibody from an experimental animal (the âparental antibodyâ), such as a rodent, and the constant domain sequences are obtained from human antibodies, so that the resulting chimeric antibody will be less likely to elicit an adverse immune response in a human subject than the parental rodent antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe monoclonal antibodies herein also include camelized single domain antibodies. See, e.g., Muyldermans et al. (2001) \nTrends Biochem. Sci. \n26:230; Reichmann et al. (1999) \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n231:25; WO 94/04678; WO 94/25591; U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,079, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties). In one embodiment, the present invention provides single domain antibodies comprising two V\nH \ndomains with modifications such that single domain antibodies are formed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term âdiabodiesâ refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) in the same polypeptide chain (V\nH\n-V\nL \nor V\nL\n-V\nH\n). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, e.g., EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Holliger et al. (1993) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n90: 6444-6448. For a review of engineered antibody variants generally see Holliger and Hudson (2005) \nNat. Biotechnol. \n23:1126-1136.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term âhumanized antibodyâ refers to forms of antibodies that contain sequences from both human and non-human (e.g., murine, rat) antibodies. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all of the framework (FR) regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody may optionally comprise at least a portion of a human immunoglobulin constant region (Fc).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention also include antibodies with modified (or blocked) Fc regions to provide altered effector functions. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821; WO2003/086310; WO2005/120571; WO2006/0057702. Such modification can be used to enhance or suppress various reactions of the immune system, with possible beneficial effects in diagnosis and therapy. Alterations of the Fc region include amino acid changes (substitutions, deletions and insertions), glycosylation or deglycosylation, and adding multiple Fc. Changes to the Fc can also alter the half-life of antibodies in therapeutic antibodies, enabling less frequent dosing and thus increased convenience and decreased use of material. See Presta (2005) \nJ. Allergy Clin. Immunol. \n116:731 at 734-35.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term âfully human antibodyâ refers to an antibody that comprises human immunoglobulin protein sequences only. A fully human antibody may contain murine carbohydrate chains if produced in a mouse, in a mouse cell, or in a hybridoma derived from a mouse cell. Similarly, âmouse antibodyâ refers to an antibody that comprises mouse immunoglobulin sequences only. Alternatively, a fully human antibody may contain rat carbohydrate chains if produced in a rat, in a rat cell, or in a hybridoma derived from a rat cell. Similarly, ârat antibodyâ refers to an antibody that comprises rat immunoglobulin sequences only.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term âhypervariable regionâ refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen-binding. The hypervariable region comprises amino acid residues from a âcomplementarity determining regionâ or âCDRâ (i.e. residues 24-34 (CDRL1), 50-56 (CDRL2) and 89-97 (CDRL3) in the light chain variable domain and residues 31-35 (CDRH1), 50-65 (CDRH2) and 95-102 (CDRH3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Kabat et al. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.) and/or those residues from a âhypervariable loopâ (i.e. residues 26-32 (CDRL1), 50-52 (CDRL2) and 91-96 (CDRL3) in the light chain variable domain and 26-32 (CDRH1), 53-55 (CDRH2) and 96-101 (CDRH3) in the heavy chain variable domain; Chothia and Lesk (1987) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n196: 901-917). As used herein, the term âframeworkâ or âFRâ residues refers to those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues defined herein as CDR residues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâBinding substanceâ refers to a molecule, small molecule, macromolecule, antibody, a fragment or analogue thereof, or soluble receptor, capable of binding to a target. âBinding substanceâ also may refer to a complex of molecules, e.g., a non-covalent complex, to an ionized molecule, and to a covalently or non-covalently modified molecule, e.g., modified by phosphorylation, acylation, cross-linking, cyclization, or limited cleavage, that is capable of binding to a target. âBinding substanceâ may also refer to a molecule capable of binding to a target in combination with a stabilizer, excipient, salt, buffer, solvent, or additive. âBindingâ may be defined as an association of the binding substance with a target where the association results in reduction in the normal Brownian motion of the binding substance, in cases where the binding substance can be dissolved or suspended in solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâConservatively modified variantsâ or âconservative substitutionâ refers to substitutions of amino acids in a protein with other amino acids having similar characteristics (e.g. charge, side-chain size, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, backbone conformation and rigidity, etc.), such that the changes can frequently be made without altering the biological activity of the protein. Those of skill in this art recognize that, in general, single amino acid substitutions in non-essential regions of a polypeptide do not substantially alter biological activity (see, e.g., Watson et al. (1987) \nMolecular Biology of the Gene\n, The Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co., p. 224 (4th Ed.)). In addition, substitutions of structurally or functionally similar amino acids are less likely to disrupt biological activity. Various embodiments of the binding compounds of the present invention comprise polypeptide chains with sequences that include up to 0 (no changes), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20 or more conservative amino acid substitutions when compared with the specific amino acid sequences disclosed herein, e.g. SEQ ID NOs: 2, 4, 5, or 6. As used herein, the phrase âup to Xâ conservative amino acid substitutions includes 0 substitutions and any number of substitutions up to and including X substitutions. Such exemplary substitutions are preferably made in accordance with those set forth in Table 2 as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExemplary Conservative Amino Acid Substitutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOriginal residue\n\n\nConservative substitution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAla (A)\n\n\nGly; Ser\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nArg (R)\n\n\nLys; His\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsn (N)\n\n\nGln; His\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAsp (D)\n\n\nGlu; Asn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCys (C)\n\n\nSer; Ala\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln (Q)\n\n\nAsn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGlu (E)\n\n\nAsp; Gln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly (G)\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis (H)\n\n\nAsn; Gln\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIle (I)\n\n\nLeu; Val\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLeu (L)\n\n\nIle; Val\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLys (K)\n\n\nArg; His\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMet (M)\n\n\nLeu; Ile; Tyr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPhe (F)\n\n\nTyr; Met; Leu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPro (P)\n\n\nAla\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer (S)\n\n\nThr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr (T)\n\n\nSer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTrp (W)\n\n\nTyr; Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTyr (Y)\n\n\nTrp; Phe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVal (V)\n\n\nIle; Leu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms âconsists essentially of,â or variations such as âconsist essentially ofâ or âconsisting essentially of,â as used throughout the specification and claims, indicate the inclusion of any recited elements or group of elements, and the optional inclusion of other elements, of similar or different nature than the recited elements, which do not materially change the basic or novel properties of the specified dosage regimen, method, or composition. As a nonlimiting example, a binding compound which consists essentially of a recited amino acid sequence may also include one or more amino acids that do not materially affect the properties of the binding compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâEffective amountâ encompasses an amount sufficient to ameliorate or prevent a symptom or sign of the medical condition. Effective amount also means an amount sufficient to allow or facilitate diagnosis. An effective amount for a particular patient or veterinary subject may vary depending on factors such as the condition being treated, the overall health of the patient, the method route and dose of administration and the severity of side affects (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,888,530 issued to Netti, et al.). An effective amount can be the maximal dose or dosing protocol that avoids significant side effects or toxic effects. The effect will result in an improvement of a diagnostic measure or parameter by at least 5%, usually by at least 10%, more usually at least 20%, most usually at least 30%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, most preferably at least 60%, ideally at least 70%, more ideally at least 80%, and most ideally at least 90%, where 100% is defined as the diagnostic parameter shown by a normal subject (see, e.g., Maynard, et al. (1996) \nA Handbook of SOPs for Good Clinical Practice\n, Interpharm Press, Boca Raton, Fla.; Dent (2001) \nGood Laboratory and Good Clinical Practice\n, Urch Publ., London, UK).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâExogenousâ refers to substances that are produced outside an organism, cell, or human body, depending on the context. âEndogenousâ refers to substances that are produced within a cell, organism, or human body, depending on the context.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâHomologyâ refers to sequence similarity between two polynucleotide sequences or between two polypeptide sequences. When a position in both of the two compared sequences is occupied by the same base or amino acid monomer subunit, e.g., if a position in each of two DNA molecules is occupied by adenine, then the molecules are homologous at that position. The percent of homology between two sequences is a function of the number of matching or homologous positions shared by the two sequences divided by the number of positions compared Ã100. For example, if 6 of 10 of the positions in two sequences are matched or homologous when the sequences are optimally aligned then the two sequences are 60% homologous. Generally, the comparison is made when two sequences are aligned to give maximum percent homology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâImmune conditionâ or âimmune disorderâ encompasses, e.g., pathological inflammation, an inflammatory disorder, and an autoimmune disorder or disease. âImmune conditionâ also refers to infections, persistent infections, and proliferative conditions, such as cancer, tumors, and angiogenesis, including infections, tumors, and cancers that resist eradication by the immune system. âCancerous conditionâ includes, e.g., cancer, cancer cells, tumors, angiogenesis, and precancerous conditions such as dysplasia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâInflammatory disorderâ means a disorder or pathological condition where the pathology results, in whole or in part, from, e.g., a change in number, change in rate of migration, or change in activation, of cells of the immune system. Cells of the immune system include, e.g., T cells, B cells, monocytes or macrophages, antigen presenting cells (APCs), dendritic cells, microglia, NK cells, NKT cells, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast cells, or any other cell specifically associated with the immunology, for example, cytokine-producing endothelial or epithelial cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâIsolated binding compoundâ refers to the purification status of a binding compound and in such context means the molecule is substantially free of other biological molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, or other material such as cellular debris and growth media. Generally, the term âisolatedâ is not intended to refer to a complete absence of such material or to an absence of water, buffers, or salts, unless they are present in amounts that substantially interfere with experimental or therapeutic use of the binding compound as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâIsolated nucleic acid moleculeâ means a DNA or RNA of genomic, mRNA, cDNA, or synthetic origin or some combination thereof which is not associated with all or a portion of a polynucleotide in which the isolated polynucleotide is found in nature, or is linked to a polynucleotide to which it is not linked in nature. For purposes of this disclosure, it should be understood that âa nucleic acid molecule comprisingâ a particular nucleotide sequence does not encompass intact chromosomes. Isolated nucleic acid molecules âcomprisingâ specified nucleic acid sequences may include, in addition to the specified sequences, coding sequences for up to ten or even up to twenty or more other proteins or portions thereof, or may include operably linked regulatory sequences that control expression of the coding region of the recited nucleic acid sequences, and/or may include vector sequences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe phrase âcontrol sequencesâ refers to DNA sequences necessary for the expression of an operably linked coding sequence in a particular host organism. The control sequences that are suitable for prokaryotes, for example, include a promoter, optionally an operator sequence, and a ribosome binding site. Eukaryotic cells are known to use promoters, polyadenylation signals, and enhancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA nucleic acid is âoperably linkedâ when it is placed into a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a presequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a preprotein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, âoperably linkedâ means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading phase. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the expressions âcell,â âcell line,â and âcell cultureâ are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. Thus, the words âtransformantsâ and âtransformed cellsâ include the primary subject cell and cultures derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. Where distinct designations are intended, it will be clear from the context.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âpolymerase chain reactionâ or âPCRâ refers to a procedure or technique in which minute amounts of a specific piece of nucleic acid, RNA and/or DNA, are amplified as described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195. Generally, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond needs to be available, such that oligonucleotide primers can be designed; these primers will be identical or similar in sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. The 5â² terminal nucleotides of the two primers can coincide with the ends of the amplified material. PCR can be used to amplify specific RNA sequences, specific DNA sequences from total genomic DNA, and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA, bacteriophage or plasmid sequences, etc. See generally Mullis et al. (1987) \nCold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. \n51:263; Erlich, ed., (1989) P\nCR \nT\nECHNOLOGY \n(Stockton Press, N.Y.) As used herein, PCR is considered to be one, but not the only, example of a nucleic acid polymerase reaction method for amplifying a nucleic acid test sample comprising the use of a known nucleic acid as a primer and a nucleic acid polymerase to amplify or generate a specific piece of nucleic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term âgermline sequenceâ refers to a sequence of unrearranged immunoglobulin DNA sequences. Any suitable source of unrearranged immunoglobulin may be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâInhibitorsâ and âantagonists,â or âactivatorsâ and âagonists,â refer to inhibitory or activating molecules, respectively, e.g., for the activation of, e.g., a ligand, receptor, cofactor, a gene, cell, tissue, or organ. A modulator of, e.g., a gene, a receptor, a ligand, or a cell, is a molecule that alters an activity of the gene, receptor, ligand, or cell, where activity can be activated, inhibited, or altered in its regulatory properties. The modulator may act alone, or it may use a cofactor, e.g., a protein, metal ion, or small molecule. Inhibitors are compounds that decrease, block, prevent, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or down regulate, e.g., a gene, protein, ligand, receptor, or cell. Activators are compounds that increase, activate, facilitate, enhance activation, sensitize, or up regulate, e.g., a gene, protein, ligand, receptor, or cell. An inhibitor may also be defined as a compound that reduces, blocks, or inactivates a constitutive activity. An âagonistâ is a compound that interacts with a target to cause or promote an increase in the activation of the target. An âantagonistâ is a compound that opposes the actions of an agonist. An antagonist prevents, reduces, inhibits, or neutralizes the activity of an agonist. An antagonist can also prevent, inhibit, or reduce constitutive activity of a target, e.g., a target receptor, even where there is no identified agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo examine the extent of inhibition, for example, samples or assays comprising a given, e.g., protein, gene, cell, or organism, are treated with a potential activator or inhibitor and are compared to control samples without the inhibitor. Control samples, i.e., samples not treated with antagonist, are assigned a relative activity value of 100% Inhibition is achieved when the activity value relative to the control is about 90% or less, typically 85% or less, more typically 80% or less, most typically 75% or less, generally 70% or less, more generally 65% or less, most generally 60% or less, typically 55% or less, usually 50% or less, more usually 45% or less, most usually 40% or less, preferably 35% or less, more preferably 30% or less, still more preferably 25% or less, and most preferably less than 25%. Activation is achieved when the activity value relative to the control is about 110%, generally at least 120%, more generally at least 140%, more generally at least 160%, often at least 180%, more often at least 2-fold, most often at least 2.5-fold, usually at least 5-fold, more usually at least 10-fold, preferably at least 20-fold, more preferably at least 40-fold, and most preferably over 40-fold higher.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEndpoints in activation or inhibition can be monitored as follows. Activation, inhibition, and response to treatment, e.g., of a cell, physiological fluid, tissue, organ, and animal or human subject, can be monitored by an endpoint. The endpoint may comprise a predetermined quantity or percentage of, e.g., indicia of inflammation, oncogenicity, or cell degranulation or secretion, such as the release of a cytokine, toxic oxygen, or a protease. The endpoint may comprise, e.g., a predetermined quantity of ion flux or transport; cell migration; cell adhesion; cell proliferation; potential for metastasis; cell differentiation; and change in phenotype, e.g., change in expression of gene relating to inflammation, apoptosis, transformation, cell cycle, or metastasis (see, e.g., Knight (2000) \nAnn. Clin. Lab. Sci. \n30:145-158; Hood and Cheresh (2002) \nNature Rev. Cancer \n2:91-100; Timme, et al. (2003) \nCurr. Drug Targets \n4:251-261; Robbins and Itzkowitz (2002) \nMed. Clin. North Am. \n86:1467-1495; Grady and Markowitz (2002) \nAnnu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. \n3:101-128; Bauer, et al. (2001) \nGlia \n36:235-243; Stanimirovic and Satoh (2000) \nBrain Pathol. \n10:113-126).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn endpoint of inhibition is generally 75% of the control or less, preferably 50% of the control or less, more preferably 25% of the control or less, and most preferably 10% of the control or less. Generally, an endpoint of activation is at least 150% the control, preferably at least two times the control, more preferably at least four times the control, and most preferably at least ten times the control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâLigandâ refers, e.g., to a small molecule, peptide, polypeptide, and membrane associated or membrane-bound molecule, or complex thereof, that can act as an agonist or antagonist of a receptor. âLigandâ also encompasses an agent that is not an agonist or antagonist, but that can bind to the receptor. Moreover, âligandâ includes a membrane-bound ligand that has been changed, e.g., by chemical or recombinant methods, to a soluble version of the membrane-bound ligand. By convention, where a ligand is membrane-bound on a first cell, the receptor usually occurs on a second cell. The second cell may have the same or a different identity as the first cell. A ligand or receptor may be entirely intracellular, that is, it may reside in the cytosol, nucleus, or some other intracellular compartment. The ligand or receptor may change its location, e.g., from an intracellular compartment to the outer face of the plasma membrane. The complex of a ligand and receptor is termed a âligand receptor complex.â Where a ligand and receptor are involved in a signaling pathway, the ligand occurs at an upstream position and the receptor occurs at a downstream position of the signaling pathway.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâSmall moleculeâ is defined as a molecule with a molecular weight that is less than 10 kDa, typically less than 2 kDa, preferably less than 1 kDa, and most preferably less than about 500 Da. Small molecules include, but are not limited to, inorganic molecules, organic molecules, organic molecules containing an inorganic component, molecules comprising a radioactive atom, synthetic molecules, peptide mimetics, and antibody mimetics. As a therapeutic, a small molecule may be more permeable to cells, less susceptible to degradation, and less apt to elicit an immune response than large molecules. Small molecules, such as peptide mimetics of antibodies and cytokines, as well as small molecule toxins, have been described (see, e.g., Casset, et al. (2003) \nBiochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. \n307:198-205; Muyldermans (2001) \nJ. Biotechnol. \n74:277-302; Li (2000) \nNat. Biotechnol. \n18:1251-1256; Apostolopoulos, et al. (2002) \nCurr. Med. Chem. \n9:411-420; Monfardini, et al. (2002) \nCurr. Pharm. Des. \n8:2185-2199; Domingues, et al. (1999) \nNat. Struct. Biol. \n6:652-656; Sato and Sone (2003) \nBiochem. J. \n371:603-608; U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,482 issued to Stewart, et al).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâSpecificallyâ or âselectivelyâ binds, when referring to a ligand/receptor, antibody/antigen, or other binding pair, indicates a binding reaction that is determinative of the presence of the protein in a heterogeneous population of proteins and other biologics. Thus, under designated conditions, a specified ligand binds to a particular receptor and does not bind in a significant amount to other proteins present in the sample. The antibody, or binding compound derived from the antigen-binding site of an antibody, of the contemplated method binds to its antigen, or a variant or mutein thereof, with an affinity that is at least two fold greater, preferably at least ten times greater, more preferably at least 20-times greater, and most preferably at least 100-times greater than the affinity with any other antigen. In a preferred embodiment the antibody will have an affinity that is greater than about 10\n9 \nM\nâ1\n, as determined, e.g., by Scatchard analysis (Munsen et al. (1980) \nAnalyt. Biochem. \n107:220-239).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term âimmunomodulatory agentâ refers to natural or synthetic agents that suppress or modulate an immune response. The immune response can be a humoral or cellular response. Immunomodulatory agents encompass immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâImmunosuppressive agentsâ, âimmunosuppressive drugsâ, or âimmunosuppressantsâ as used herein are therapeutics that are used in immunosuppressive therapy to inhibit or prevent activity of the immune system. Clinically they are used to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs and tissues (e.g. bone marrow, heart, kidney, liver), and/or in the treatment of autoimmune diseases or diseases that are most likely of autoimmune origin (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis) Immunosuppressive drugs can be classified as: glucocorticoids; cytostatics; antibodies (biological response modifiers); drugs acting on immunophilins; other drugs, including known chemotherpeutic agents used in the treatment of proliferative disorders. For multiple sclerosis, in particular, the antibodies of the present invention can be administered in conjunction with a new class of myelin binding protein-like therapeutics, known as copaxones.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nâAnti-inflammatory agentsâ or âanti-inflammatory drugsâ refer to both steroidal and non-steroidal therapeutics. Steroids, also known as corticosteroids, are drugs that closely resemble cortisol, a hormone produced naturally by adrenal glands. Steroids are used as the main treatment for certain inflammatory conditions, such as: systemic vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels); and myositis (inflammation of muscle). Steroids might also be used selectively to treat inflammatory conditions such as: rheumatoid arthritis (chronic inflammatory arthritis occurring in joints on both sides of the body); systemic lupus erythematosus (a generalized disease caused by abnormal immune system function); SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (chronic disorder that causes dry eyes and a dry mouth).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, usually abbreviated to NSAIDs, are drugs with analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effectsâthey reduce pain, fever and inflammation. The term ânon-steroidalâ is used to distinguish these drugs from steroids, which (amongst a broad range of other effects) have a similar eicosanoid-depressing, anti-inflammatory action. NSAIDs are generally indicated for the symptomatic relief of the following conditions: rheumatoid arthritis; osteoarthritis; inflammatory arthropathies (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome); acute gout; dysmenorrhoea; metastatic bone pain; headache and migraine; postoperative pain; mild-to-moderate pain due to inflammation and tissue injury; pyrexia; and renal colic. NSAIDs include salicylates, arlyalknoic acids, 2-arylpropionic acids (profens), N-arylanthranilic acids (fenamic acids), oxicams, coxibs, and sulphonanilides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be administered, often in combination with NSAIDs. Commonly prescribed DMARDs include hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, methotrexate, gold therapy, sulfasalazine, and azathioprine.\n\n\n \nII. Antibodies Specific for Human IL-17A\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides engineered anti-IL-17A antibodies and uses thereof to treat various inflammatory, immune and proliferative disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis osteoporosis, inflammatory fibrosis (e.g., scleroderma, lung fibrosis, and cirrhosis), inflammatory bowel disorders (e.g., Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease), asthma (including allergic asthma), allergies, COPD, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable method for generating monoclonal antibodies may be used to generate the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention. For example, a recipient animal may be immunized with a linked or unlinked (e.g. naturally occurring) form of the IL-17A homodimer, or a fragment thereof. Any suitable method of immunization can be used. Such methods can include adjuvants, other immunostimulants, repeated booster immunizations, and the use of one or more immunization routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable form of IL-17A can be used as the immunogen (antigen) for the generation of the non-human antibody specific for IL-17A, which antibody can be screened for biological activity. The eliciting immunogen may be full-length mature human IL-17A, including linked and naturally occurring homodimers, or peptides thereof encompassing single epitopes or multiple epitopes. The immunogen may be used alone or in combination with one or more immunogenicity enhancing agents known in the art. The immunogen may be purified from a natural source or produced in a genetically modified cell. DNA encoding the immunogen may be genomic or non-genomic (e.g., cDNA) in origin. Immunogen-encoding DNA may be expressed using suitable genetic vectors, including but not limited to adenoviral vectors, adenoassociated viral vectors, baculoviral vectors, plasmids, and non-viral vectors, such as cationic lipids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable method can be used to elicit an antibody response with the desired biologic properties, e.g. to inhibit IL-17A binding to its receptor. In some embodiments, antibodies are raised in mammalian hosts such as mice, rodents, primates, humans, etc. Techniques for preparing monoclonal antibodies may be found in, e.g., Stites et al. (eds.) B\nASIC AND \nC\nLINICAL \nI\nMMUNOLOGY \n(4th ed.) Lange Medical Publications, Los Altos, Calif., and references cited therein; Harlow and Lane (1988) A\nNTIBODIES\n: A \nLABORATORY \nM\nANUAL \nCSH Press; Goding (1986) M\nONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES\n: P\nRINCIPLES AND \nP\nRACTICE \n(2d ed.) Academic Press, New York, N.Y. Thus, monoclonal antibodies may be obtained by a variety of techniques familiar to researchers skilled in the art. Typically, spleen cells from an animal immunized with a desired antigen are immortalized, commonly by fusion with a myeloma cell. See Kohler and Milstein (1976) \nEur. J. Immunol. \n6:511-519. Alternative methods of immortalization include transformation with Epstein Barr Virus, oncogenes, or retroviruses, or other methods known in the art. See, e.g., Doyle et al. (eds.) (1994 and periodic supplements) C\nELL AND \nT\nISSUE CULTURE\n: L\nABORATORY \nP\nROCEDURES\n, John Wiley and Sons, New York, N.Y. Colonies arising from single immortalized cells are screened for production of antibodies of the desired specificity and affinity for the antigen. The yield of monoclonal antibodies produced by such cells may be enhanced by various techniques, including injection into the peritoneal cavity of a vertebrate host.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable techniques involve selection of libraries of antibodies in phage or similar vectors. See, e.g., Huse et al., Science 246:1275-1281 (1989); and Ward et al., \nNature \n341:544-546 (1989). The antibodies of the present invention may be used without modification, e.g. as the parental rodent antibody, or with modifications to facilitate their use as therapeutic agents in human subjects, such as chimeric or humanized antibodies. In some embodiments, the antibodies will be labeled, covalently or non-covalently, with a substance that provides a detectable signal. A wide variety of labels and conjugation techniques are known and are reported extensively in both the scientific and patent literature. Suitable labels include radionuclides, enzymes, substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, fluorescent moieties, chemiluminescent moieties, magnetic particles, and the like. Patents teaching the use of such labels include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,817,837; 3,850,752; 3,939,350; 3,996,345; 4,277,437; 4,275,149; and 4,366,241. Also, recombinant immunoglobulins may be produced, see Cabilly U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Queen et al. (1989) \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n86:10029-10033; or made in transgenic mice, see Mendez et al. (1997) \nNature Genetics \n15:146-156; also see Abgenix and Medarex technologies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies against predetermined fragments of IL-17A can be raised by immunization of animals with conjugates of the predetermined fragment of IL-17A with carrier proteins. Monoclonal antibodies are prepared from cells secreting the desired antibody. These antibodies can be screened for binding to normal or defective IL-17A. These monoclonal antibodies will usually bind with at least a K\nd \nof about 1 Î¼M, more usually at least about 300, 30, 10, or 3 nM, preferably at least about 300, 100, 30, 10, 3, or 1 pM. Because of the inverse relationship of K\nd \nvalues and affinity, references to binding with a given K\nd \nâor lessâ refers to binding with an affinity that is at least as high as the recited numerical value, i.e. with a K\nd \nthat is at least as low as the cited value. Binding affinities may be determined by ELISA (see Examples 5-6, infra), or by BiacoreÂ® surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, KinExA or ECL methods (see Example 7, infra). Suitable non-human antibodies may also be identified using the biological assays described in Examples 8-11 and 16-17, infra.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary method of producing anti-human IL-17A antibodies of the present invention is described at Example 2.\n\n\n \nIII. Humanization of IL-17A Specific Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nAny suitable non-human antibody can be used as a source for the hypervariable region of an anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention. Sources for non-human antibodies include, but are not limited to, rodents (e.g. mouse, rat), Lagomorphs (including rabbits), cows, and nonhuman primates. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which hypervariable region residues of the recipient are replaced by hypervariable region residues from a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity and affinity. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody, such as modifications made to further refine antibody performance of the desired biological activity. For further details, see Jones et al. (1986) \nNature \n321: 522-525; Reichmann et al. (1988) \nNature \n332: 323-329; and Presta (1992) \nCurr. Op. Struct. Biol. \n2: 593-596.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for recombinantly engineering and producing antibodies have been described, e.g., by Boss et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,397), Cabilly et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567), Law et al. (European Patent Application Publication No. 438 310) and Winter (European Patent Application Publication No. 239 400).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence variants of humanized anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention may be prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody DNA, or by peptide synthesis. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution may be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post-translational processing of the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody, such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne useful method for identifying residues or regions of a humanized anti-IL-17A antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called âalanine scanning mutagenesis.â Cunningham and Wells (1989) \nScience \n244: 1081-1085. A group of target residues is identified (e.g., charged residues such as Arg, Asp, His, Lys, and Glu) and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (most preferably alanine or polyalanine) to alter the interaction of the amino acids with IL-17A. The residues showing functional sensitivity to alanine substitutions are then refined by introducing further amino acid substitutions. In one embodiment, the effect of mutations at a given target codon is determined by alanine scanning or random mutagenesis followed by activity and binding analysis of the resulting humanized anti-IL-17A antibody variants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include humanized anti-IL-17A antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to an epitope tag. Other variants include the fusion of an enzyme or a polypeptide that increases the serum half-life of an antibody to the N- or C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody molecule removed and a different residue inserted in its place. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable loops, but FR alterations are also contemplated. Hypervariable region residues or FR residues involved in antigen binding are generally substituted in a relatively conservative manner.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther amino acid variants of the antibody alter the original glycosylation pattern of the antibody, e.g. by eliminating one or more carbohydrate moieties and/or adding one or more glycosylation sites. Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N-linked or O-linked. N-linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine-X-serine and asparagine-X-threonine, where X is any amino acid except proline, are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. The presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O-linked glycosylation involves attachment of N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid, most commonly serine or threonine, although 5-hydroxyproline or 5-hydroxylysine may also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlycosylation sites can be added to the antibodies of the present invention by inserting one or more of the above-described tripeptide sequences (for N-linked glycosylation sites), or addition of one or more serine or threonine residues (for O-linked glycosylation sites).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of humanized IL-17A-specific antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, isolation from a natural source (in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants), or by oligonucleotide-mediated (or site-directed) mutagenesis, PCR mutagenesis, or cassette mutagenesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOrdinarily, amino acid sequence variants of the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody will have an amino acid sequence having at least 50% amino acid sequence identity with the original humanized antibody amino acid sequences of either the heavy or the light chain, preferably at least 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. Identity or homology with respect to this sequence is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with the humanized anti-IL-17A residues when the sequences are optimally aligned (i.e. after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity), and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. None of N-terminal, C-terminal, or internal extensions, deletions, or insertions into the antibody sequence is considered to affect sequence identity or homology.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe humanized antibody can be selected from any class of immunoglobulins, including IgM, IgG, IgD, IgA, and IgE. In one embodiment, the antibody is an IgG antibody. Any isotype of IgG can be used, including IgG\n1\n, IgG\n2\n, IgG\n3\n, and IgG\n4\n. Variants of the IgG isotypes are also contemplated. The humanized antibody may comprise sequences from more than one class or isotype. Optimization of the necessary constant domain sequences to generate the desired biologic activity is readily achieved by screening the antibodies in the biological assays described below in the Examples.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLikewise, either class of light chain can be used in the compounds and methods herein. Specifically, kappa, lambda, or variants thereof are useful in the present compounds and methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable portion of the CDR sequences from the non-human antibody can be used to create the humanized antibodies of the present invention. The CDR sequences may be mutagenized by substitution, insertion or deletion, although such mutations would be minimal because of the need to maintain IL-17A binding affinity and specificity. Typically, at least 75% of the humanized antibody CDR residues will correspond to those of the non-human CDR residues, more often 90%, and most preferably greater than 95%, and frequently 100%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny suitable portion of the FR sequences from the human antibody can be used. The FR sequences can be mutagenized by substitution, insertion or deletion of at least one residue such that the FR sequence is distinct from the human and non-human antibody sequence employed. It is contemplated that such mutations would be minimal. Typically, at least 75% of the humanized antibody residues will correspond to those of the human FR residues, more often 90%, and most preferably greater than 95%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso contemplated are chimeric antibodies or fragments thereof, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al. (1984) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81: 6851-6855). As noted above, typical chimeric antibodies comprise constant domain sequences from antibodies from one species linked to the variable domain of an antigen-specific antibody obtained from a different species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe binding compounds of the invention may comprise bispecific antibodies. As used herein, the term âbispecific antibodyâ refers to an antibody, typically a monoclonal antibody, having binding specificities for at least two different antigenic epitopes. In one embodiment, the epitopes are from the same antigen. In another embodiment, the epitopes are from two different antigens. Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. For example, bispecific antibodies can be produced recombinantly using the co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain/light chain pairs. See, e.g., Milstein et al. (1983) \nNature \n305: 537-39. Alternatively, bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. See, e.g., Brennan, et al. (1985) \nScience \n229: 81. Bispecific antibodies include bispecific antibody fragments. See, e.g., Hollinger, et al. (1993) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n90: 6444-48, Gruber, et al., \nJ. Immunol. \n152: 5368 (1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn exemplary method of humanizing anti-human IL-17A antibodies of the present invention is described at Example 3.\n\n\n \nIV.

Although they were obtained as independent clones, parental rat antibodies 16C10 and 4C3 are identical in the sequence of the V\nH \nregion and differ in the V\nL \nregion only by a framework substitution (isoleucine at position 15 in 16C10 is valine in 4C3). As a result, the CDRs are identical for these two parental rat antibodies, and thus for their humanized forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequences are provided for humanized V\nL \nregions of antibodies 16C10/4C3 and 30C10 at SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 22, respectively. Sequences are provided for humanized V\nH \nregions of antibodies 16C10/4C3 and 30C10 at SEQ ID NOs: 6 and 23, respectively. These humanized variable domains may be used to create full-length chimeric or humanized antibodies by adding the appropriate constant domain sequences. Other embodiments include various other alterations in the CDR amino acid residues in the 16C10 heavy chain, for example, as illustrated in Table 4. With reference to the residue numbering of \nFIG. 1B\n, the alterations described in Table 4 (and in SEQ ID NOs: 17 and 20) are N54A, N54Q, N60A, N60Q, M96L, M96A, M96K, M96F, M100hF, M100hL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the present invention, chimeric light and heavy chains of antibody 16C10 are created by appending human constant domains (human kappa light chain and human IgG1 constant domain, respectively) to the C-terminus of the humanized V\nL \n(SEQ ID NO: 5) and V\nH \nregions (SEQ ID NO: 6). Sequences of chimeric 16C10 light and heavy chains are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 9 and 10. In other embodiments, chimeric forms of antibodies 30C10 and 4C3 are created by fusing the same constant domains from chimeric 16C10 to their respective humanized V\nL \nand V\nH \nregions (SEQ ID NOs: 22 and 23 for 30C10; SEQ ID NOs: 5 and 6 for 4C3). The chimeric form of humanized 4C3 would, of course, be identical to the chimeric form of humanized 16C10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, full length humanized antibodies are created by substituting framework residues (i.e. those amino acid residues in the variable domain that are not part of a CDR) of the chimeric forms antibodies with human germline framework sequences, as described in more detail in Example 3. The resulting antibodies retain only the CDR sequences from the rat antibodies, with the constant domains and framework sequences replaced by human-derived sequences. Full-length light and heavy chains for humanized antibody 16C10, including signal sequences, are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4, respectively. In other embodiments, humanized forms of antibodies 4C3 and 23E12 are created by analogy with the method described for 16C10, i.e. substituting the appropriate human framework sequences into the sequence of the chimeric versions of these antibodies (described supra). See Example 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, the full-length light and heavy chains of the humanized antibodies of the present invention are cloned to have a signal peptide at their N-terminus to facilitate secretion from cells when the antibody is produced. In one embodiment, a 19 amino acid signal sequence is added to both the light and heavy chains of the humanized 16C10 antibody (residues â19 to â1 of SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4). DNA sequences of the full length light and heavy chains of humanized 16C10, with signal sequence added, are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 3. Such DNA sequences can be cloned and expressed in any suitable expression vector for production of the humanized antibodies of the present invention. In other embodiments, signal sequences may be added to the light and heavy chains of humanized antibodies 30C10 and 4C3, as described for antibody 16C10. In other embodiments, signal sequence peptides are added that are different than the specific signal sequence provided in SEQ ID NOs: 1-4, depending on the intended method of production of the antibodies. Such signal sequences may be obtained from the scientific literature, for example Choo et al. (2005) âSPdbâa signal peptide database,â \nBMC Bioinformatics \n6:249.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, different constant domains may be appended to the humanized V\nL \nand V\nH \nregions provided herein. For example, if a particular intended use of an antibody (or fragment) of the present invention were to call for altered effector functions, a heavy chain constant domain other than IgG1 may be used. Although IgG1 antibodies provide for long half-life and for effector functions, such as complement activation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, such activities may not be desirable for all uses of the antibody. In such instances an IgG4 constant domain, for example, may be used.\n\n\n \nV. Affinity and Biological Activity of Humanized Anti-IL-17A\n\n\n \n \n \nAntibodies having the characteristics identified herein as being desirable in a humanized anti-IL-17A antibody can be screened for inhibitory biologic activity in vitro, in vivo, or by measuring binding affinity. To screen for antibodies that bind to the same epitope on human IL-17A bound by an antibody of interest (e.g., those which block binding of the cytokine to its receptor), a routine cross-blocking assay can be performed such as that described in A\nNTIBODIES\n, A L\nABORATORY \nM\nANUAL\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Ed Harlow and David Lane (1988). Alternatively, epitope mapping can be performed to determine whether the antibody binds an epitope of interest, e.g., as described in Champe et al. (1995) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n270:1388-1394. Antibody affinities (e.g. for human IL-17A) may be determined using standard methods, including those described in Example 7. Preferred humanized antibodies are those which bind human IL-17A with a K\nd \nvalue of no more than about 100 nM (1Ã10\nâ7\nM); preferably no more than about 10 nM; more preferably no more than about 1 nM. Even more preferred are embodiments in which the antibodies have K\nd \nvalues of no more than about 200 pM (2Ã10\nâ10 \nM), 100 pM, 50 pM, 20 pM, 10 pM, 5 pM or even 2 pM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies, and fragments thereof, useful in the present compounds and methods include, but are not limited to, biologically active antibodies and fragments. As used herein, the term âbiologically activeâ refers to an antibody or antibody fragment that is capable of binding the desired the antigenic epitope and directly or indirectly exerting a biologic effect. Typically, these effects result from the failure of IL-17A to bind its receptor. As used herein, the term âspecificâ refers to the selective binding of the antibody to the target antigen epitope. Antibodies can be tested for specificity of binding by comparing binding to IL-17A to binding to irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture under a given set of conditions. An antibody is considered to be specific if it binds to IL-17A with an affinity at least 10-fold, and preferably 50-fold higher than its affinity for an irrelevant antigen or antigen mixture. An antibody that âspecifically bindsâ to a protein comprising IL-17A (or a fragment thereof) does not bind to proteins that do not comprise the IL-17A-derived sequences, i.e. âspecificityâ as used herein relates to IL-17A specificity, and not any other sequences that may be present in the protein in question. For example, as used herein, an antibody that âspecifically bindsâ to FLAG-hIL-17A, which is a fusion protein comprising IL-17A and a FLAGÂ® peptide tag, does not bind to the FLAGÂ® peptide tag alone or when it is fused to a protein other than IL-17A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data presented in the Examples below show (e.g. Example 7) that humanized antibody 16C10 (including the N54Q and M96A substitutions relative to the parental rat heavy chain CDRs) has a high affinity for binding to human IL-17A, with a K\nd \nin the 1-10 pM range as determined by KinExA analysis. In vitro activity assays, such as Ba/F3 hIL-17Rc-GCSFR cell proliferation assay (Example 11), normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) assay (Example 9), and human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synoviocyte assay (Example 8) confirm that hu16C10 is a high affinity antibody since the observed IC50 values were typically less than or equal to 50% of the concentration of hIL-17A present in the assay (100 pM, 1000 pM, and 1000 pM in the three assays, respectively). The bivalent character of the antibodies used in the experiments, and the potential for IL-17A dimer formation, make it possible to achieve 50% inhibition of a given concentration of IL-17A with less than 0.5 molar equivalents of antibody. In vivo activity assays, such as administration to mice exhibiting collagen-induced arthritis (Example 16) and BAL neutrophil recruitment assay (Example 17) confirm the activity of several of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention in animals. The in vitro and in vivo activity assays also confirm that humanized antibody 16C10 is a neutralizing antibody, which was not known from the binding experiments alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of several of the antibodies of the present invention to bind to cyno IL-17A as well as human IL-17A is advantageous because such a potential therapeutic antibody can be used directly in cynomolgus monkey for toxicology studies, rather than having to develop a separate cyno-specific antibody for such studies. The high affinity of several of the antibodies of the present invention is also advantageous in that may reduce the required dosage in human (and other) subjects, which reduces the likelihood of certain adverse reactions. In addition, the high affinity may reduce the volume that must be administered to a subject and reduce the cost of treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe serum half-life of hu16C10 was measured in mouse and in cynomolgus monkeys. In cyno, half-life after intravenous (iv) administration was evaluated in a dose ranging study with 0.4, 4.0 and 40 mg/kg dosing. Serum concentrations of drug were measured periodically for 42 days. The half-life for subcutaneous (sc) administration in cyno was determined at 4 mg/kg dosing, which was also followed for 42 days. The half-life in cynomolgus monkeys was 10-19 days iv and 28 days sc as measured by the terminal slope of the drug concentration versus time profile. Certain anomalous datapoints at higher dosings were excluded from the analysis. Similar experiments in mice showed that the hu16C10 antibody had a half-life of 13-25 days iv and 12-22 days sc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExample 19 describes methods used to determine the epitope bound by an exemplary anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention (16C10), i.e. residues in the region of L74-Y85 of human IL-17A (SEQ ID NO.: 40). Since the biological assay data presented herein demonstrate that antibody 16C10 is a high affinity neutralizing antibody, other antibodies that bind to the same epitope may also be expected to be neutralizing antibodies, and perhaps also have high binding affinity. The epitope as determined herein is obtained by functional measurements, rather than structure determinations, and the epitope reported herein may differ in detail from the epitope determined by structural methods. The epitope reported herein includes at least some, but not necessarily all, of the amino acid residues that are important for antibody 16C10 binding. The epitope bound by antibodies of the present invention may also be determined by other methods, such as cross-blocking experiments (see Example 12), or by structural methods such as X-ray crystal structure determination. Additional antibodies binding to the same epitope as antibody 16C10 may be obtained, for example, by screening of antibodies raised against hIL-17A, or by immunization of an animal with a peptide comprising the epitope sequence.\n\n\n \nV. Antibody Production\n\n\n \n \n \nFor recombinant production of the antibody, the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) or for expression. DNA encoding the monoclonal antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence. In one embodiment, both the light and heavy chains of the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention are expressed from the same vector, e.g. a plasmid or an adenoviral vector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies of the present invention may be produced by any method known in the art. In one embodiment, antibodies are expressed in mammalian or insect cells in culture, such as chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, mouse myeloma NSO cells, baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells, \nSpodoptera frugiperda \novarian (Sf9) cells. In one embodiment, antibodies secreted from CHO cells are recovered and purified by standard chromatographic methods, such as protein A, cation exchange, anion exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Resulting antibodies are concentrated and stored in 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the antibodies of the present invention are produced in yeast according to the methods described in WO2005/040395. Briefly, vectors encoding the individual light or heavy chains of an antibody of interest are introduced into different yeast haploid cells, e.g. different mating types of the yeast \nPichia pastoris\n, which yeast haploid cells are optionally complementary auxotrophs. The transformed haploid yeast cells can then be mated or fused to give a diploid yeast cell capable of producing both the heavy and the light chains. The diploid strain is then able to secret the fully assembled and biologically active antibody. The relative expression levels of the two chains can be optimized, for example, by using vectors with different copy number, using transcriptional promoters of different strengths, or inducing expression from inducible promoters driving transcription of the genes encoding one or both chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the respective heavy and light chains of a plurality of different anti-IL-17A antibodies (the âoriginalâ antibodies) are introduced into yeast haploid cells to create a library of haploid yeast strains of one mating type expressing a plurality of light chains, and a library of haploid yeast strains of a different mating type expressing a plurality of heavy chains. These libraries of haploid strains can be mated (or fused as spheroplasts) to produce a series of diploid yeast cells expressing a combinatorial library of antibodies comprised of the various possible permutations of light and heavy chains. The combinatorial library of antibodies can then be screened to determine whether any of the antibodies has properties that are superior (e.g. higher affinity for IL-17A) to those of the original antibodies. See. e. g., WO2005/040395.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, antibodies of the present invention are human domain antibodies in which portions of an antibody variable domain are linked in a polypeptide of molecular weight approximately 13 kDa. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Publication No. 2004/0110941. Such single domain, low molecular weight agents provide numerous advantages in terms of ease of synthesis, stability, and route of administration.\n\n\n \nVI. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration\n\n\n \n \n \nTo prepare pharmaceutical or sterile compositions of the anti-huIL-17A antibodies of the present invention, the antibody is admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. See, e.g., \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences \nand \nU.S. Pharmacopeia: National Formulary\n, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1984).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of therapeutic and diagnostic agents may be prepared by mixing with physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients, or stabilizers in the form of, e.g., lyophilized powders, slurries, aqueous solutions or suspensions (see, e.g., Hardman, et al. (2001) \nGoodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics\n, McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y.; Gennaro (2000) \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy\n, Lippincott, Williams, and Wilkins, New York, N.Y.; Avis, et al. (eds.) (1993) \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Parenteral Medications\n, Marcel Dekker, NY; Lieberman, et al. (eds.) (1990) \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets\n, Marcel Dekker, NY; Lieberman, et al. (eds.) (1990) \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Disperse Systems\n, Marcel Dekker, NY; Weiner and Kotkoskie (2000) \nExcipient Toxicity and Safety\n, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, N.Y.). In one embodiment, anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention are diluted to an appropriate concentration in a sodium acetate solution pH 5-6, and NaCl or sucrose is added for tonicity. Additional agents, such as \npolysorbate\n 20 or \npolysorbate\n 80, may be added to enhance stability.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the antibody compositions, administered alone or in combination with another agent, can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD\n50 \n(the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED\n50 \n(the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index (LD\n50\n/ED\n50\n). Antibodies exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED\n50 \nwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mode of administration is not particularly important. Suitable routes of administration include oral, rectal, transmucosal, or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. Administration can be carried out in a variety of conventional ways, such as oral ingestion, inhalation, insufflation, topical application or cutaneous, transdermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, parenteral, intra-arterial or intravenous injection. Intravenous administration to the patient is preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternately, one may administer the antibody in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the antibody directly into an arthritic joint or pathogen-induced lesion characterized by immunopathology, often in a depot or sustained release formulation. Furthermore, one may administer the antibody in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with a tissue-specific antibody, targeting, for example, arthritic joint or pathogen-induced lesion characterized by immunopathology. The liposomes will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the afflicted tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe administration regimen depends on several factors, including the serum or tissue turnover rate of the therapeutic antibody, the level of symptoms, the immunogenicity of the therapeutic antibody, and the accessibility of the target cells in the biological matrix. Preferably, the administration regimen delivers sufficient therapeutic antibody to effect improvement in the target disease state, while simultaneously minimizing undesired side effects. Accordingly, the amount of biologic delivered depends in part on the particular therapeutic antibody and the severity of the condition being treated. Guidance in selecting appropriate doses of therapeutic antibodies is available (see, e.g., Wawrzynczak (1996) \nAntibody Therapy\n, Bios Scientific Pub. Ltd, Oxfordshire, UK; Kresina (ed.) (1991) \nMonoclonal Antibodies, Cytokines and Arthritis\n, Marcel Dekker, New York, N.Y.; Bach (ed.) (1993) \nMonoclonal Antibodies and Peptide Therapy in Autoimmune Diseases\n, Marcel Dekker, New York, N.Y.; Baert, et al. (2003) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n348:601-608; Milgrom et al. (1999) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n341:1966-1973; Slamon et al. (2001) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n344:783-792; Beniaminovitz et al. (2000) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n342:613-619; Ghosh et al. (2003) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n348:24-32; Lipsky et al. (2000) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n343:1594-1602).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of the appropriate dose is made by the clinician, e.g., using parameters or factors known or suspected in the art to affect treatment. Generally, the dose begins with an amount somewhat less than the optimum dose and it is increased by small increments thereafter until the desired or optimum effect is achieved relative to any negative side effects. Important diagnostic measures include those of symptoms of, e.g., the inflammation or level of inflammatory cytokines produced. Preferably, a biologic that will be used is derived from the same species as the animal targeted for treatment, thereby minimizing an inflammatory, autoimmune, or proliferative response to the reagent. In the case of human subjects, for example, chimeric, humanized and fully human antibodies are preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies, antibody fragments, and cytokines can be provided by continuous infusion, or by doses administered, e.g., daily, 1-7 times per week, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bimonthly etc. Doses may be provided intravenously, subcutaneously, topically, orally, nasally, rectally, intramuscular, intracerebrally, intraspinally, or by inhalation. A total weekly dose is generally at least 0.05 Î¼g/kg body weight, more generally at least 0.2 Î¼g/kg, 0.5 Î¼g/kg, 1 Î¼g/kg, 10 Î¼g/kg, 100 Î¼g/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/ml, 10 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg or more (see, e.g., Yang, et al. (2003) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n349:427-434; Herold, et al. (2002) \nNew Engl. J. Med. \n346:1692-1698; Liu, et al. (1999) \nJ. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psych. \n67:451-456; Portielji, et al. (20003) \nCancer Immunol. Immunother. \n52:133-144). Doses may also be provided to achieve a pre-determined target concentration of anti-IL-17A antibody in the subject's serum, such as 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300 Î¼g/ml or more. In other embodiments, a humanized anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention is administered subcutaneously or intravenously, on a weekly, biweekly or âevery 4 weeksâ basis at 10, 20, 50, 80, 100, 200, 500, 1000 or 2500 mg/subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, âinhibitâ or âtreatâ or âtreatmentâ includes a postponement of development of the symptoms associated with a disorder and/or a reduction in the severity of the symptoms of such disorder. The terms further include ameliorating existing uncontrolled or unwanted symptoms, preventing additional symptoms, and ameliorating or preventing the underlying causes of such symptoms. Thus, the terms denote that a beneficial result has been conferred on a vertebrate subject with a disorder, disease or symptom, or with the potential to develop such a disorder, disease or symptom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the terms âtherapeutically effective amountâ, âtherapeutically effective doseâ and âeffective amountâ refer to an amount of an IL-17A binding compound of the invention that, when administered alone or in combination with an additional therapeutic agent to a cell, tissue, or subject, is effective to prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms of a disease or condition or the progression of such disease or condition. A therapeutically effective dose further refers to that amount of the binding compound sufficient to result in amelioration of symptoms, e.g., treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of the relevant medical condition, or an increase in rate of treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of such conditions. When applied to an individual active ingredient administered alone, a therapeutically effective dose refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, a therapeutically effective dose refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially or simultaneously. An effective amount of a therapeutic will result in an improvement of a diagnostic measure or parameter by at least 10%; usually by at least 20%; preferably at least about 30%; more preferably at least 40%, and most preferably by at least 50%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for co-administration with a second therapeutic agent, e.g., cytokine, another therapeutic antibody, steroid, chemotherapeutic agent, or antibiotic are well known in the art, see, e.g., Hardman, et al. (eds.) (2001) \nGoodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, \n10\nth \ned., McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y.; Poole and Peterson (eds.) (2001) \nPharmacotherapeutics for Advanced Practice: A Practical Approach\n, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Phila., PA; Chabner and Longo (eds.) (2001) \nCancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy\n, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Phila., PA. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may also contain immunosuppressive or immunomodulating agents. Any suitable immunosuppressive agent can be employed, including but not limited to anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, tacrolimus (i.e., FK-506), sirolimus, interferons, soluble cytokine receptors (e.g., sTNRF and sIL-1R), agents that neutralize cytokine activity (e.g., inflixmab, etanercept), mycophenolate mofetil, 15-deoxyspergualin, thalidomide, glatiramer, azathioprine, leflunomide, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and the like. The pharmaceutical composition can also be employed with other therapeutic modalities such as phototherapy and radiation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IL-17A binding compounds of the present invention can also be used in combination with one or more antagonists of other cytokines (e.g. antibodies), including but not limited to, IL-23, IL-113, IL-6 and TGF-Î². See, e.g., Veldhoen (2006) \nImmunity \n24:179-189; Dong (2006) \nNat. Rev. Immunol. \n6(4):329-333. In various embodiments, an IL-17A binding compound of the invention is administered before, concurrently with, or after administration of the another antagonist or antagonists. In one embodiment, an IL-17A binding compound of the present invention is used in treatment of the acute early phase of an adverse immune response (e.g. MS, Crohn's Disease) alone or in combination with an IL-23 antagonist. In the latter case, the IL-17A binding compound may be gradually decreased and treatment with the antagonist of IL-23 alone is continued to maintain suppression of the adverse response. Alternatively, antagonists to IL-1Î², IL-6 and/or TGF-Î² may be administered concurrently, before or after an IL-17A binding compound of the present invention. See Cua and Kastelein (2006) \nNat. Immunol. \n7:557-559; Tato and O'Shea (2006) \nNature \n441:166-168; Iwakura and Ishigame (2006) \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n116:1218-1222.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical veterinary, experimental, or research subjects include monkeys, dogs, cats, rats, mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, horses, and humans.\n\n\n \nVII. Uses.\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides methods for using engineered anti-IL-17A antibodies for the treatment and diagnosis of inflammatory disorders and conditions, as well as autoimmune and proliferative disorders. Methods are provided for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), psoriasis, systemic scleroderma, allograft rejection, autoimmune myocarditis and peritoneal adhesions (see, e.g., Chung et al. (2002) \nJ. Exp. Med. \n195:1471-78).\n\n\n \nPsoriasis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe skin serves as an important boundary between the internal milieu and the environment, preventing contact with potentially harmful antigens. In the case of antigen/pathogen penetration, an inflammatory response is induced to eliminate the antigen. This response leads to a dermal infiltrate that consists predominantly of T cells, polymorphonuclear cells, and macrophages (see, e.g., Williams and Kupper (1996) \nLife Sci., \n58:1485-1507.) Normally, this inflammatory response, triggered by the pathogen, is under tight control and will be halted upon elimination of the pathogen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain cases this inflammatory response occurs without external stimuli and without proper controls, leading to cutaneous inflammation. The present invention provides methods for treating and diagnosing cutaneous inflammation. Cutaneous inflammation, the result of the cellular infiltrate noted above as well as the secreted cytokines from these cells, encompasses several inflammatory disorders such as cicatricial pemphigoid, scleroderma, hidradenitis suppurativa, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acne, osteitis, graft vs. host disease (GvHD), pyroderma gangrenosum, and Behcet's Syndrome (see, e.g., Willams and Griffiths (2002) \nClin. Exp. Dermatol., \n27:585-590). The most common form of cutaneous inflammation is psoriasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPsoriasis is characterized by T cell mediated hyperproliferation of keratinocytes coupled with an inflammatory infiltrate. The disease has certain distinct overlapping clinical phenotypes including chronic plaque lesions, skin eruptions, and pustular lesions (see, e.g., Gudjonsson et al. (2004) \nClin Exp. Immunol. \n135:1-8). Approximately 10% of psoriasis patients develop arthritis. The disease has a strong but complex genetic predisposition, with 60% concordance in monozygotic twins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe typical psoriatic lesion is a well defined erythematous plaque covered by thick, silvery scales. The inflammation and hyperproliferation of psoriatic tissue is associated with a different histological, antigenic, and cytokine profile than normal skin. Among the cytokines associated with psoriasis are: TNFÎ±, IL-19, IL-18, IL-15, IL-12, IL-7, IFNÎ³, IL-17A and IL-23 (see Gudjonsson et al., supra). IL-17A has been detected in psoriatic skin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention, either alone or in combination with other agents, may be used in prevention, treatment, diagnosis and prediction of psoriasis flare-ups. Use of anti-IL-17A antibodies in prediction and treatment of psoriatic outbreaks is described in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Publication 2005/0287593 and PCT Patent Publication WO 2005/108616, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.\n\n\n \nRheumatoid Arthritis (RA)\n\n\n \n \n \nRA is a progressive, systemic disease characterized by inflammation of the synovial joints affecting about 0.5% of the world's population. Emery (2006) \nBMJ \n332:152-155. Joint inflammation can lead to deformity, pain, stiffness and swelling, and ultimately to irreversible deterioration of the joint. Affected joints include knees, elbows, neck and joints of the hands and feet. Conventional treatment involves use of NSAIDs to alleviate symptoms, followed by administration of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as gold, penicillamine, sulfasalazine and methotrexate. Recent advances include treatment with TNF-Î± inhibitors, including monoclonal antibodies, such as infliximab, adalumimab and golimumab, and receptor fusion proteins, such as etanercept. Treatment with these TNF-Î± inhibitors dramatically reduces structural damage from the disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention may be used to treat RA in subjects in need of such treatment. Example 16 describes experiments involving the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model of RA, for which data are presented at \nFIGS. 3A-3D\n, and Table 15. The results show a reduction in the fraction of paws with high disease severity scores in animals treated with an anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention as compared with diluent and isotype controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention may also be combined with other treatments for RA, e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, NSAIDs, or TNF-Î± inhibitors (antibodies or receptor fragments).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention are used to treat human subjects who have not previously responded adequately to treatment with DMARDs alone. In another embodiment, treatment with the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention is begun early in the course of disease, without requiring prior failure of DMARD therapy. Such early intervention may be appropriate, for example, once the safety of the antibody therapy has been firmly established.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClinical improvement is measured by determining the ACR score, as described in more detail in Example 18. In various embodiments, ACR scores of 20, 50, and 70 are the desired endpoint, and these endpoints may be assessed at any appropriate point in the course of treatment, such as 5, 10, 15, 24, 40, 50 or more weeks.\n\n\n \nMultiple Sclerosis (MS)\n\n\n \n \n \nMS is thought to be an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) involving loss of myelin from nerve fibers, resulting in plaques or lesions. The most common form is relapsing/remitting MS in which well defined symptomatic flare-ups occur, followed by periods of partial or complete remission. Conventional treatment options include interferon-Î²-1a and -1b, mitoxantrone, the tetrapeptide glatiramer acetate, therapeutic alpha-4-integrin-specific antibodies (natalizumab), or small molecule antagonists of alpha-4-integrin (e.g. those disclosed at WO2003/084984).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention may be used to treat MS in subjects in need of such treatment. The anti-IL-17A antibodies may also be combined with other treatments for MS, e.g. interferon-Î², interferon-Î±, steroids or alpha-4-integrin-specific antibodies.\n\n\n \nInflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)\n\n\n \n \n \nIBD is the name for a group of disorders (e.g. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) in which the intestines become inflamed, resulting in abdominal cramps and pain, diarrhea, weight loss and intestinal bleeding. IBD affects over 600,000 Americans. Conventional treatment options include sulfasalazine, corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone), immune system suppressors such as azathioprine and mercaptopurine, or an antibiotic (e.g. metronidazole) for Crohn's disease. Therapeutic monoclonal antibody treatments include etanercept, natalizumab and infliximab.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention may be used to treat IBD in subjects in need of such treatment. Yen et al. (2006) \nJ. Clin. Invest. \n116:1310-1316; Fujimo et al. (2003) \nGut \n52:65-70. The anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention may also be combined with other treatments for IBD, e.g. IL-10 (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,368,854, 7,052,686), steroids and sulfasalazine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, antibodies of the present invention that do not block binding of IL-17A to its receptor (e.g. non-neutralizing antibody 12E6) are used therapeutically to stabilize IL-17A in subjects in need to prolonged IL-17A activity. Such subjects include patients suffering from infections or cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany modifications and variations of this invention can be made without departing from its spirit and scope, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The invention is defined by the terms of the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. The specific embodiments described herein, including the following examples, are offered by way of example only, and do not by their details limit the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \nExample 1\n\n\nGeneral Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nStandard methods in molecular biology are described (Maniatis, et al. (1982) \nMolecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual\n, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; Sambrook and Russell (2001) \nMolecular Cloning, \n3\nrd \ned., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; Wu (1993) Recombinant DNA, Vol. 217, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif.).

Standard techniques for characterizing ligand/receptor interactions are available (see, e.g., Coligan, et al. (2001) \nCurrent Protocols in Immunology, Vol. \n4, John Wiley, Inc., New York).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal, polyclonal, and humanized antibodies can be prepared (see, e.g., Sheperd and Dean (eds.)

Nos. 5,932,448, 5,532,210, and 6,129,914).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBispecific antibodies are also provided (see, e.g., Azzoni et al. (1998) \nJ. Immunol. \n161:3493; Kita et al. (1999) \nJ.

Immunol. \n165:2214; Long (1999) \nAnn. Rev. Immunol. \n17:875).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPurification of antigen is not necessary for the generation of antibodies. Animals can be immunized with cells bearing the antigen of interest. Splenocytes can then be isolated from the immunized animals, and the splenocytes can fused with a myeloma cell line to produce a hybridoma (see, e.g., Meyaard et al. (1997) \nImmunity \n7:283-290; Wright et al. (2000) \nImmunity \n13:233-242; Preston et al., supra; Kaithamana et al. (1999) \nJ. Immunol. \n163:5157-5164).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies will usually bind with at least a K\nd \nof about 10\nâ6 \nM, typically at least 10\nâ7 \nM, more typically at least 10\nâ8 \nM, preferably at least about 10\nâ9 \nM, and more preferably at least 10\nâ10 \nM, and most preferably at least 10\nâ11 \nM (see, e.g., Presta et al.

Eight week old female Lewis rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley, Indianapolis, Ind., USA) were given a series of injections of recombinant human IL-17A (rhIL-17A) that had been expressed from adenoviral vectors in HEK 293 cells. The injections were given at \ndays\n 0, 14, 32, 46, and 83.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nday\n 0 injection was a subcutaneous (sc) injection of 50 Î¼g rhIL-17A, accompanied by intraperitoneal (ip) injection of Freund's Complete Adjuvant. Day 14, 32 and 46 sc injections of 25 Î¼g rhIL-17A were accompanied by ip injection of Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant. The day 83 injection was a combination of an ip injection of 20 Î¼g rhIL-17A in Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant and an intravenous (iv) tail vein injection of rhIL-17A in saline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA test bleed was performed at day 53. Fusion of rat splenocytes was performed on day 87, using 1.6Ã10\n8 \nsplenocytes and 1.8Ã10\n8 \nmyeloma cells divided into in thirty 96-well plates, giving a total of 1.13Ã10\n5 \ntotal cells per well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimary screening of the resulting monoclonal antibodies (thousands) was performed by indirect rhIL-17A ELISA (see Example 5). Secondary screens on the resulting antibodies included neutralization of rhIL-17A-induced expression of murine IL-6 by ST2 (mouse stromal) cells and neutralization of rhIL-17A-induced proliferation of Ba/F3 hIL-17Rc:mGCSFR cells (see Example 11). Approximately eleven of the monoclonals were studied further after the first and second screens. Subsequent experiments were performed to confirm that the candidate antibodies were able to bind to native huIL-17A to ensure that they would be useful in various therapeutic, diagnostic and/or research purposes. Such screening may be done using binding assays (such as indirect ELISA or sandwich ELISA), by in vitro activity assay, or by in vivo activity assay, examples of which are provided herein.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nHumanization of Rat Anti Human IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe humanization of rat anti human IL-17A monoclonal antibody 16C10 was performed essentially as described in WO 2005/047324 and WO 2005/047326, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. Briefly, human constant domains were used to replace the parental (rat) constant domains, and human germline sequences homologous to the rat variable domain sequences were selected and used to provide a human framework for the rat CDRs, as described in more detail below.\n\n\n \nProcedure for Selection of Human Germline Framework Sequences\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following steps are used in selecting the appropriate germline framework sequences in humanizing the anti-human IL-17A antibodies of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1) Clone and sequence non-human V\nL \nand V\nH \ndomains and determine amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \nHeavy Chain\n\n\n \n \n \n2) Compare the non-human V\nH \nsequence to a group of five human V\nH \ngermline amino acid sequences; one representative from subgroups IGHV1 and IGHV4 and three representatives from subgroup IGHV3.

Comparison to the five germline sequences is performed as follows:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nA) Assign the non-human V\nH \nsequence residue numbers according to Kabat et al. (1991).\n \nB) Align the non-human V\nH \nsequence with each of the five human germline sequences. Since the V genes only comprise V\nH \nresidues 1-94, only these residues are considered in the alignment.\n \nC) Delineate the complementarity-determining (CDR) and framework (FR) regions in the sequence. CDR and FR are defined as a combination of the definitions provided in Kabat et al. (1991) (Id.) and Chothia and Lesk (1987) âCanonical Structures for the Hypervariable Regions of Immunoglobulinsâ, \nJournal of Molecular Biology, \n196:901-917.

This combination of the rat variable domains and human constant domains comprises a chimeric version of antibody 16C10. The sequences of the light and heavy chains of this chimeric 16C10 are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 9 and 10, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to modification of the framework regions of the variable domains, the amino acid sequence of the V\nH \ndomain of antibody 16C10 was compared to a group of five human V\nH \ngermline amino acid sequences; one representative from subgroups IGHV1 and IGHV4 and three representatives from subgroup IGHV3. The V\nH \nsubgroups are listed in M.-P. Lefranc, âNomenclature of the Human Immunoglobulin Heavy (IGH) Genes,â \nExperimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, \n18:100-116, 2001.

Lefranc, âThe Human Immunoglobulin Kappa Variable (IGKV) Genes and Joining (IGKJ) Segmentsâ, \nExperimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, \n15:171-183, 1998 and M.-P. Lefranc, âNomenclature of the Human Immunoglobulin Kappa (IGK) Genesâ, \nExperimental and Clinical Immunogenetics, \n18:161-174, 2001. The four subgroups also correspond to the four subgroups listed in Kabat et al. (1991) at pp. 103-130. Antibody 16C10 scored highest against human light chain germline Z-A19 in subgroup II.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce the desired germline framework sequences were determined, a plasmid encoding the full-length humanized variable heavy and light chains was generated. Substitution of human framework residues in place of the framework residues of the parental rat antibody 16C10 can be viewed equivalently as the grafting of the rat 16C10 CDRs onto the human framework sequences. The resulting antibody is referred to herein as â16C10wtâ, with the âwtâ designating the presence of the same CDRs as the parental rat 16C10, as distinguished from the optimized CDRs (having two single amino acid alterations) discussed below. Both the light and heavy chain variable domains were codon optimized, synthesized and inserted onto constant domains to provide for potentially optimal expression. Codon optimization, which may improve expression of cloned antibodies, is purely optional.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the substitution of human constant domain and framework sequences, the humanized 16C10 wt antibody was also modified at two CDR residues to provide for greater chemical stability of the final humanized antibody. The two changes are represented by bolded amino acid residues in the âhu16C10â V\nH \nsequence shown in \nFIG. 1B\n. With reference to the Kabat numbering used in \nFIG. 1B\n, residue 54 of CDR2 was changed from N (asparagine) in the rat antibody to Q (glutamine) in the humanized antibody to reduce the potential for formation of isoaspartate at the NG sequence at residues 54-55. Isoaspartate formation may debilitate or completely abrogate binding of an antibody to its target antigen. Presta (2005) \nJ. Allergy Clin. Immunol. \n116:731 at 734. In addition, residue 96 of CDR3 was changed from M (methionine) in the rat antibody to A (alanine) in the humanized antibody to reduce the possibility that the methionine sulfur would oxidize, which could reduce antigen binding affinity and also contribute to molecular heterogeneity in the final antibody preparation. Id. These single-residue modifications can be represented as N54Q and M96A. The final humanized 16C10 antibody disclosed herein comprises these two substitutions relative to the parental rat 16C10 CDRs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment of the present invention, the chimeric (not humanized) 16C10 antibody is altered to incorporate the two single-residue modifications described above for the humanized form, i.e. N54Q and M96A.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequences of the light and heavy chains of humanized antibody 16C10 (hu 16C10) are provided at \nFIGS. 2A and 2B\n respectively, and at SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4 (which include signal sequences). One embodiment of nucleotide sequences encoding the light and heavy chains of hu 16C10 are shown in SEQ ID NOs:1 and 3. Another embodiment of nucleotide sequences encoding the light and heavy chains of hu 16C10 are shown in \nFIG. 5A\n (SEQ ID NO:62) and \nFIG. 5B\n (SEQ ID NO:63).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the interest of clarity with regard to nomenclature, it is important to recognize that the Kabat numbering system includes non-numerical amino acid residue designations (e.g. V\nH \nresidues 83a, 83b, 83c) to accommodate variations in the lengths of CDRs and framework regions among various antibodies. Although this numbering system is advantageous in allowing easy reference to corresponding amino acid residues among various antibodies with CDRs of different lengths, it can result in conflicting designations for specific amino acid residues when compared with strict sequential-numeric sequence numbering (e.g. sequence listings). Amino acid residue designations herein are made with reference to the relevant sequence listing unless otherwise noted, for example by reference to âKabat numberingâ.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs an additional point of clarification with regard to nomenclature, SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4 (humanized 16C10) include the sequences of N-terminal signal peptides (the first 19 residues of each), which amino acids are removed in the mature form of the antibody. SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 62 and 63 include 57 nucleotides encoding the signal sequences. As used herein, a âmatureâ form of a protein refers to the protein without the signal sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanized antibody 4C3 is created by methods analogous to those described above for antibody 16C10. Because the parental rat 4C3 antibody differed only at a single amino acid residue in the framework region of the light chain, and such framework regions are replaced with human germline framework sequences during humanization, the ultimate humanized 4C3 antibody sequence is identical to the sequence of humanized 16C10 antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHumanized antibody 30C10 is also created by methods analogous to those described above for antibody 16C10. In determining the proper human framework sequences to be used, the parental rat 30C10 antibody scores highest against human heavy chain germline DP-46 in subgroup III and human light chain germline Z-A19 in subgroup II, so those framework sequences are substituted for the rat framework sequences. The humanized 30C10 V\nL \nand V\nH \nsequences are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 22 and 23, respectively. In other embodiments, one or more methionine residues in the CDRs of rat 30C10 are mutated to avoid the potential of oxidation of the methionine sulfur in the humanized 30C10 antibody. Specifically, heavy chain residue 34 (in CDRH1) and/or light chain residue 30f (Kabat numbering, see \nFIG. 1A\n) are changed from methionine to another amino acid, e.g. alanine. Such antibodies are subsequently screened to ensure that the methionine substitution does not decrease IL-17A binding affinity to unacceptable levels.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChimeric, humanized, and signal sequence-containing versions of antibody 12E6 are created using the methods described herein, by analogy with preparation of such antibodies based on parental rat antibody 16C10. Light and heavy chain CDRs for parental rat antibody 12E6 are provided at SEQ ID NOs: 34-36 and 37-39. Human constant domain and variable domain framework sequences are introduced as described above.

These transgenic mice, referred to herein as âHuMAbâ mice, contain human immunoglobulin gene miniloci that encode unrearranged human heavy (Î¼ and Î³) and Îº light chain immunoglobulin sequences, together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous Î¼ and Îº chain loci (Lonberg et al. (1994) \nNature \n368(6474):856-859). Accordingly, the mice exhibit reduced expression of mouse IgM or Îº, and in response to immunization, the introduced human heavy and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate high affinity human IgG Îº monoclonal antibodies (Lonberg et al. (1994), supra; reviewed in Lonberg (1994) \nHandbook of Experimental Pharmacology \n113:49-101; Lonberg et al. (1995) \nIntern. Rev. Immunol. \n13:65-93, and Harding et al. (1995) \nAnn. N Y. Acad. Sci. \n764:536-546). The preparation of HuMab mice is commonly known in the art and is described, for example, in Taylor et al. (1992) \nNucleic Acids Research \n20:6287-6295; Chen et al. (1993) \nInternational Immunology \n5: 647-656; Tuaillon et al. (1993) \nProc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA \n90:3720-3724; Choi et al. (1993) \nNature Genetics \n4:117-123; Chen et al.

(1994); Fishwild et al. (1996) and WO 98/24884. Preferably, the mice are 6-16 weeks of age upon the first immunization. For example, a purified preparation of IL-17A can be used to immunize the HuMab mice intraperitoneally. The mice can also be immunized with whole HEK293 cells that are stably transformed or transfected with an IL-17A gene. An âantigenic IL-17A polypeptideâ may refer to an IL-17A polypeptide of any fragment thereof, which elicits an anti-IL-17A immune response in HuMab mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, HuMAb transgenic mice respond best when initially immunized intraperitoneally (IP) with antigen in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by every other week IP immunizations (usually up to a total of 6) with antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Mice are immunized first with cells expressing IL-17A (e.g., stably transformed HEK293 cells), then with a soluble fragment of IL-17A, followed by alternating immunizations with the two antigens. The immune response is monitored over the course of the immunization protocol with plasma samples being obtained by retroorbital bleeds. The plasma are screened for the presence of anti-IL-17A antibodies, for example by ELISA, and mice with sufficient titers of immunoglobulin are used for fusions. Mice are boosted intravenously with antigen three days before sacrifice and removal of the spleen. Two to three fusions for each antigen may be necessary. Several mice are immunized for each antigen. For example, a total of twelve HuMAb mice of the HCO7 and HCO12 strains can be immunized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHybridoma cells producing the monoclonal, fully human anti-IL-17A antibodies are produced by methods commonly known in the art, such as the hybridoma technique originally developed by Kohler et al. (1975) (\nNature \n256:495-497); the trioma technique (Hering et al. (1988) \nBiomed. Biochim. Acta. \n47:211-216 and Hagiwara et al. (1993) \nHum. Antibod. Hybridomas \n4:15); the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor et al. (1983) \nImmunology Today \n4:72 and Cote et al. (1983) \nProc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. \n80:2026-2030); and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole et al. (1985) in \nMonoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy\n, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96). Preferably, mouse splenocytes are isolated and fused with PEG to a mouse myeloma cell line based on standard protocols. The resulting hybridomas may then be screened for the production of antigen-specific antibodies. In one embodiment, single cell suspensions of splenic lymphocytes from immunized mice are fused to one-sixth the number of P3X63-Ag8.653 nonsecreting mouse myeloma cells (ATCC, CRL 1580) with 50% PEG. Cells are plated at approximately 2Ã10\n5 \ncells/mL in a flat bottom microtiter plate, followed by a two week incubation in selective medium containing 20% fetal Clone Serum, 18% â653â conditioned media, 5% origen, 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5 mM HEPES, 0.055 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 mg/ml gentamicin and 1ÃHAT (Sigma; the HAT is added 24 hours after the fusion). After two weeks are cultured in medium in which the HAT is replaced with HT. Individual wells are then screened by ELISA for human anti-IL-17A monoclonal IgG antibodies. Once extensive hybridoma growth occurs, medium is observed usually after 10-14 days. The antibody secreting hybridomas are replated, screened again, and if still positive for human IgG, anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies are subcloned at least twice by limiting dilution. The stable subclones are then cultured in vitro to generate small amounts of antibody in tissue culture medium for characterization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the anti-IL-17A antibody molecules of the present invention are produced recombinantly (e.g., in an \nE. coli\n/T7 expression system). In this embodiment, nucleic acids encoding the antibody molecules of the invention (e.g., V\nH \nor V\nL\n) are inserted into a pET-based plasmid and expressed in the \nE. coli\n/T7 system. There are several methods to produce recombinant antibodies known in the art, e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567 which is hereby incorporated by reference. The antibody molecules may also be produced recombinantly in CHO or NSO cells.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nIndirect ELISA of anti-IL-17A Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nBinding of anti-human-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies to rhIL-17A is assessed using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, a fixed concentration of rhIL-17A is bound directly to the wells of a microtiter plate. The monoclonal anti-IL-17A to be assayed is then is added to the rhIL-17A coated plate, where the antibody is captured and quantitated. A more detailed protocol follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 96-well U-bottom MaxiSorp plate is coated with 50 Î¼l/well of rhIL-17A (0.5 Î¼g/ml) in carbonate coating buffer (the âassay plateâ). Carbonate coating buffer is 2.9 g/L NaHCO\n3\n, 1.6 g/L Na\n2\nCO\n3\n, pH 9.4. Plates are incubated covered at 4Â° C. overnight. Monoclonal antibodies to be screened are serially diluted in duplicate across the rows of a V-bottom plate such that the final volume is 60 Î¼l/well (the âserial dilution plateâ). The assay plate is washed three times with PBS-Tween in a plate washer (SkanWasher, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif., USA) and blotted dry. PBS-Tween is obtained by adding 0.5 ml/\nL Tween\n 20 to 1ÃPBS. Fifty Î¼l from each well of the serial dilution plate is transferred to the assay plate and incubated at 25Â° C. for one hour. Secondary antibodies are diluted 1/2000 in diluent (PBS-BSA-Tween, which is PBS-Tween with 1 g/L BSA). The secondary antibody for rat monoclonal antibodies is goat anti-rat IgG (H+L)âHRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, Pa., USA). The secondary antibody for chimeric and humanized monoclonal antibodies is F(abâ²)\n2 \ngoat anti-human IgG FcÎ³âHRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). The assay plate is washed as before. Diluted secondary antibodies (100 Î¼l/well) are added to the appropriate wells in the assay plate, and the plate is incubated at 25Â° C. for 45 minutes. The assay plate is washed as before. ABTS (100 Î¼l/well) (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, Md., USA) is added, and the plate is incubated at 25Â° C. for 5-10 minutes, after which absorbance is read at 405 nm on a plate reader (Versamax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif., USA) with a 5 second shake before reading.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIndirect ELISA results for various forms of antibody 16C10 of the present invention are shown in Table 5. Binding is reported as an EC50 (the concentration of antibody necessary to obtain half-maximal signal). The results show that binding is detected with all forms of 16C10. Although such indirect ELISA assays are useful in quickly determining the presence or absence of anti-IL-17A antibodies, the EC50 numbers obtained may be assay-dependent and are typically not used to assess the absolute binding affinity for any given antibody.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndirect Anti-IL-17A Antibody ELISA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmAb\n\n\nrhIL-17A (Î¼g)\n\n\nEC50 (pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n274\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nchimeric 16C10\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n157\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhumanized 16C10 wt\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n212\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 6\n\n\nELISA of Anti-IL-17A Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nBinding of anti-human-IL-17A monoclonal antibodies to rhIL-17A is assessed using an ELISA as follows. Briefly, a capture antibody is bound to the wells of a microtiter plate, after which a fixed concentration of rhIL-17A is added. The monoclonal anti-IL-17A to be assayed is then titrated versus the bound rhIL-17A on the plate to determine the concentration of antibody needed to achieve half-maximal binding. A more detailed protocol follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA 96-well microtiter plate is coated with 100 Î¼l/well of capture antibody (rat anti-hIL-17A 12E6, 0.5 Î¼g/ml) in carbonate coating buffer pH 9.5 (the âassay plateâ). Plates are incubated covered at 4Â° C. for 24 to 48 hours. The assay plate is washed three times in a plate washer (SkanWasher, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif., USA) and blotted dry. The plate is then blocked with 200 Î¼l/well of ELISA assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, pH7.4, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20, 2 mM EDTA) for one hour at 25Â° C. on an orbital shaker. The plate is washed, and 100 Owen of either adenovirus-derived rhIL-17A or \nE. coli\n-derived human IL-17 (IL-17A) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., USA) (0.1 Î¼g/ml) is added in ELISA assay buffer and incubated for 2 hours at 25Â° C. on an orbital shaker. The plate is washed and the monoclonal antibodies to be screened are serially diluted across a row of seven wells in the range of 1000 ng/ml to 0.0813 ng/ml using 4-fold serial dilutions. Plates are incubated for 1.5 hours at 25Â° C. on an orbital shaker. Plates are washed and 100 Î¼l/well secondary antibody (F(abâ²)\n2 \ngoat anti-human kappa light chainâHRP, 1:20,000 dilution, BioSource, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) is added, except for assay blank wells. Plates are washed twice (i.e. two cycles of 3 washes per cycle) with plate rotation between cycles. TMB substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, Md., USA) is added at 100 Î¼l/well and incubated 3-5 minutes on an orbital shaker. Stop solution is added (100 Î¼l/well) and the plate is read for absorbance at 450-570 nm on a plate reader (Versamax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif., USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nELISA results for various forms of antibody 16C10 of the present invention are shown in Table 6.

(Gaithersburg, Md., USA), and was employed to measure the binding of rat anti-human IL-17A antibodies (and one chimeric antibody) to FLAG-huIL-17A. See the ElecsysÂ® immunoassay system, Roche Diagnostics (Indianapolis, Ind., USA). Electrochemiluminescence technology uses a stable ruthenium metal chelate (Ori-TAG) which, in the presence of tripropylamine (TPA), generates electrochemiluminescence upon voltage application. Paramagnetic beads, microns in diameter, act as the solid phase and facilitate rapid assay kinetics. The bead/complex is channeled through a flow cell and captured at an electrode by magnetic application. Voltage is applied and resulting electrochemiluminescence is measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nECL assays were performed as follows. Three-fold serial dilutions of anti-human IL-17A mAbs in 50 Î¼l of the assay buffer were made in a 96-well microtiter plate to give 1-3 Î¼g/ml final concentration in the first well. Fifty Î¼l of the assay buffer and 50 Î¼l of biotinylated FLAG-huIL-17A at 50 ng/ml was added to each well, followed by the addition of either OriTag-labeled goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) pAb (50 Î¼l at 450 ng/ml) or an anti-hIgG mAb (50 Î¼l at 500 ng/ml). Finally 50 Î¼l of Origen Streptavidin-Dynabeads at 0.1 mg/ml was added to each well. After 1 hr incubation at 25Â° C. the plate was processed by the Origen M-series M8/384 analyzer. GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif., USA) was used to plot the data and calculate area under the curve, which is a rough measure of binding.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are presented in Table 7 (which includes some duplicate determinations). The two rows showing binding of rat 16C10 to FLAG-huIL-17A represent duplicate determinations. All rat anti-human IL-17A antibodies in the table (1D10, 16C10, 30C10, 23E12) bound to FLAG-huIL-17A, as did the chimeric 16C10. All four antibodies also bound to cyno IL-17A. Antibodies 16C10 and 30C10 did not bind to mouse IL-17A under the conditions of this assay, whereas antibodies 1D10 and 23E12 did.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody Binding Determined by ECL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nArea Under\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nmAb\n\n\nAntigen\n\n\nPeak\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n\n\n477474\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n\n\n285792\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n\n\n374445\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 30C10\n\n\nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n\n\n311752\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n\n\n285145\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nchimeric 16C10\n\n\nFLAG-hu-IL-17A\n\n\n345982\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\ncyno IL-17\n\n\n136497\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\ncyno IL-17\n\n\n151543\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 30C10\n\n\ncyno IL-17\n\n\n123916\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\ncyno IL-17\n\n\n111242\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\n252121\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\n384999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\nno binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\nno binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 30C10\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\nno binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 30C10\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\nno binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\n143206\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\nmu IL-17\n\n\n289185\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nDetermining the Equilibrium Dissociation Constant (K\nd\n) for Rat and Humanized Anti-Human IL-17A Antibodies Using KinExA Technology\n\n\n \n \n \nThe equilibrium dissociation constants (K\nd\n) for anti human IL-17A antibodies were determined using the KinExA 3000 instrument (Sapidyne Instruments Inc., Boise, Id., USA). KinExA uses the principle of the Kinetic Exclusion Assay method based on measuring the concentration of uncomplexed antibody in a mixture of antibody, antigen and antibody-antigen complex. See, e.g., Darling and Brault (2004) \nAssay Drug Dev. Technol. \n2(6):647-57. The concentration of free antibody is measured by exposing the mixture to a solid-phase immobilized antigen for a very brief period of time. In practice, this is accomplished by flowing the solution phase antigen-antibody mixture past antigen-coated particles trapped in a flow cell. Data generated by the instrument are analyzed using custom software. Equilibrium constants are calculated using a mathematical theory based on the following assumptions:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n1. The binding follows the reversible binding equation for equilibrium:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nk\n \non\n[Ab][Ag]=\nk\n \noff\n[AbAg], where \nK\n \nd\n \n=k\n \noff\n \n/k\n \non \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Antibody (Ab) and antigen (Ag) bind 1:1 and total antibody equals antigen-antibody complex (AbAg) plus free antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n3. Instrument signal is linearly related to free antibody concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinExA analysis was performed on several rat anti-human IL-17A antibodies, humanized variants thereof, and sequence variants of these humanized antibodies. IL-17A was derived from either human (âhuâ), cynomolgus monkey (âcynoâ), or mouse (âmuâ).

Poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) particles (98 micron) were coated with human, cyno or mouse IL-17A according to Sapidyne âProtocol for coating PMMA particles with biotinylated ligands having short or nonexistent linker arms.â All experimental procedures were done according to the KinExA 3000 manual.

Molar concentrations for the KinexA analysis were calculated on the basis of a molecular weight of 75 kDa for antibodies and 15 kDa for IL-17A to account for the presence of two binding sites on the antibodies and the dimeric nature of IL-17A. For some antibodies, replicate experiments were performed with different batches of antibody and/or antigen, in which cases mean values are provided in Table 9 along with standard errors. Binding constants for the humanized 16C10 wt antibody and the parental rat 16C10 antibody were similar at approximately 5-10 pM, showing that humanization did not significantly reduce the high affinity of the parental rat 16C10 for human IL-17A. Humanized 16C10 incorporating various amino acid substitutions (N54Q, M96A, M100hF), including the final humanized 16C10 antibody (having N54Q and M96A substitutions compared to rat 16C10) were also assayed and found to have similar, high binding constants in the 1-10 pM range. The Fab fragment of hu 16C10 bound retained high affinity (16 pM) compared with the complete antibody. Other antibodies of the present invention (rat 1D10, rat 23E12, rat 30C10) also bound with high affinity to FLAG-huIL-17A, and to cyno IL-17A. Although rat 1D10 bound to mouse with 10 pM affinity, similar to its affinity for human and cyno IL-17A, rat 23E12 had 200-2000 lower affinity for mouse IL-17A (7000 pM). Antibodies 16C10 and 30C10 did not bind to mouse IL-17A (data not shown).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\nd \nValues Determined by KinExA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmAb\n\n\nAntigen\n\n\nKd(pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n6.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nFLAG-huIL-17A\n\n\n3.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 wt\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n8.8 Â± 3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 [=VH N54Q/M96A]\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n3.9 Â± 2.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 Fab\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n16.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 VH N54A\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n10.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 VH N54Q\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n7.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 VH M96A\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n9.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 VH N54Q/M96A/M100hF\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\nFLAG-huIL-17A\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\nFLAG-huIL-17A\n\n\n2.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 30C10\n\n\nFLAG-huIL-17A\n\n\n11.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\ncyno IL-17A\n\n\n9.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\ncyno IL-17A\n\n\n28.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 30C10\n\n\ncyno IL-17A\n\n\n32.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\ncyno IL-17A\n\n\n1.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10\n\n\ncyno IL-17A\n\n\n16.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\nmu IL-17A\n\n\n10.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\nmu IL-17A\n\n\n7,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther methods known in the art, such as BiacoreÂ® surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy may be used to measure the affinity of antibodies of the present invention. Although BiacoreÂ® analysis was performed on several of the antibodies of the present invention, the binding affinity was generally too high to be measured accurately, specifically, the dissociation rate was too slow to be measured by this method. Such analysis may, however, be of use in the analysis of lower-affinity anti-IL-17A antibodies or anti-IL-17A antibodies having faster dissociation rate constants.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nSynoviocyte Assay for Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention to block the biological activity of IL-17A (either rhIL-17A or native huIL-17A) is measured by monitoring IL-17A-induced expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in primary culture of human synoviocytes, as follows. Synoviocytes are isolated by collagenase digestion of a rheumatoid arthritis synovium obtained from a knee replacement patient. Synoviocytes are enriched by continuous passage in Growth Medium (DMEM, 10% BCS, 1Ã Pen-Strep (50 IU/ml penicillin, 55 Î¼g/ml streptomycin), 1Ã beta-mercaptoethanol (50 Î¼M), 1Ã glutamine (20 mM), 25 mM HEPES), frozen down at passage number three, and stored in liquid nitrogen. When ready for use in an assay, a vial of the cells is thawed, plated, and the cells are allowed to grow to near confluence. The cells are then passaged 1:2 into larger flasks using typsin/EDTA. When sufficient cells have expanded, an experiment is initiated by trypsinizing the cells, plating into 96 well or 48 well plates, and allowing them to grow to total confluence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIL-17A is diluted to 120 ng/ml, i.e. 4Ã the final concentration of 30 ng/ml (1 nM). IL-17A is either human (rhIL-17A and native huIL-17A) or from a non-human primate, in this case cynomolgus monkeys (cyno). 100 and 300 Î¼l aliquots of the 4ÃIL-17A stocks are added to empty 96-well and 48-well plates, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IL-17A antibodies to be assayed are diluted in Growth Medium to 4Ã the maximum concentration to be tested in an experiment. The 4Ã anti-IL-17A stock is serially diluted 1:2 to cover the dynamic inhibition range of the assay. Each of the serially diluted antibody samples (all are 4Ã their final concentration) are mixed 1:1 with the 4ÃIL-17A solutions in empty plates to generate mixtures with 2Ã concentrations of both IL-17A and anti-IL-17A antibodies. These mixtures are allowed to equilibrate at 37Â° C. in a tissue culture incubator for more than four hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMedium is removed from the adherent confluent synoviocytes and replaced with 100 Î¼l (96-well plate) or 200 Î¼l (48-well plate) of Growth Medium. An equal volume of the 2Ãligand/2Ã antibody solution is added to synoviocytes to give 1ÃIL-17A (30 ng/ml final) and 1Ã antibody. Each well (data point) is run in duplicate. Synoviocytes are activated (i.e. exposed to the IL-17A/antibody mixture) for three days, at which point supernatants are transferred to 96 well plates, and optionally frozen, and stored at â80Â° C. until analyzed. Microtiter plates containing supernatants are thawed and each solution is diluted 1:10 using Growth Medium. Supernatants are analyzed for IL-6 and IL-8 using Luminex bead pairs (Upstate, Charlottesville, Va., USA) following manufacturer's instructions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are provided at Tables 10 (IL-6) and 11 (IL-8). Values presented with error ranges represent the mean of multiple determinations with the standard deviation. Results for various forms of antibody 16C10 are shown, including a humanized form of 16C10 having the original rat CDRs (âhu16C10 (wt)â) as well as several variants having one, two or three changes in the heavy chain CDRs (generally âhu16C10 X##Zâ, where X is the amino acid at residue ## in the heavy chain of hu16C10 (wt) and Z is the new amino acid). âNHP IL-17Aâ is non-human primate-derived IL-17A, in this case cynomolgus monkey IL-17A. âNative huIL-17Aâ refers to mature huIL-17A produced when the precursor protein is produced using the natural signal sequence, and differs from rhIL-17A by the absence of two N-terminal amino acids. Concentrations and IC50 values are expressed in ng/ml, but may be expressed in pM units as well. For example, 30 ng/ml rhIL-17A corresponds to 1000 pM (MW=30 kDa) and 70 ng/ml anti-IL-17A antibody corresponds to approximately 470 pM (MW=150 kDa).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 (ng/ml) of Anti-IL-17A Measured by Synoviocyte IL-6 Production\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\nNHP IL-17A\n\n\nNative huIL-17A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n(30 ng/ml)\n\n\n(30 ng/ml)\n\n\n(10 ng/ml)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\n105 Â± 28\n\n\n65 Â± 15\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\n63 Â± 7\n\n\n60 Â± 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (wt)\n\n\nâ80 Â± 10\n\n\nâ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (N54A)\n\n\n60\n\n\nâ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (N54Q)\n\n\n60\n\n\nâ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (M96A)\n\n\n60\n\n\nâ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (M96K)\n\n\n60\n\n\nâ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (M100hF)\n\n\n70\n\n\nâ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10\n\n\n70 Â± 8\n\n\n70 Â± 0â\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(N54Q/M96A)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nhu16C10\n \n\n\n70\n\n\nâ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(N54Q/M96A/M100hF)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 (ng/ml) of Anti-IL-17A Measured by Synoviocyte IL-8 Production\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\nNHP IL-17A\n\n\nNative huIL-17A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibody\n\n\n(30 ng/ml)\n\n\n(30 ng/ml)\n\n\n(10 ng/ml)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1D10\n\n\n59 Â± 41\n\n\n38 Â± 13\n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16C10\n\n\n38 Â± 14\n\n\n33 Â± 8â\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (wt)\n\n\n42 Â± 16\n\n\nâ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (N54A)\n\n\n25\n\n\nâ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (N54Q)\n\n\n25\n\n\nâ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (M96A)\n\n\n25\n\n\nâ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (M96K)\n\n\n25\n\n\nâ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10 (M100hF)\n\n\n50\n\n\nâ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu16C10\n\n\n38 Â± 10\n\n\n38 Â± 13\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(N54Q/M96A)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nhu16C10\n \n\n\n40\n\n\nâ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(N54Q/M96A/M100hF)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 9\n\n\nNHDF Assay for Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention to block the biological activity of IL-17A is measured by monitoring rhIL-17A-induced expression of IL-6 in a normal human (adult) dermal fibroblast (NHDF) primary cell line. Briefly, various concentrations of an anti-IL-17A antibody to be assayed are incubated with rhIL-17A, and the resulting mixture is then added to cultures of NHDF cells. IL-6 production is determined thereafter as a measure of the ability of the antibody in question to inhibit IL-17A activity. A more detailed protocol follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA series two-fold dilutions of anti-IL-17A antibodies of interest are prepared (in duplicate) starting with a stock solution at 40 Î¼g/ml. A stock solution of rhIL-17A is prepared at 120 ng/ml. Seventy Î¼l of the rhIL-17A stock solution is mixed with 70 Î¼l of the anti-IL-17A antibody dilutions in wells of a microtiter plate and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. One hundred Î¼l of each of these mixtures is then added to wells of a microtiter plate that had been seeded with 1Ã10\n4 \nNHDF cells/well (100 Î¼l) the previous night and allowed to incubate at 37Â° C. NHDF cells (passage 4) were obtained from Cambrex Bio Science (Baltimore, Md., USA). The resulting final concentration of rhIL-17A is 30 ng/ml (1 nM), and the antibodies range downward in two-fold intervals from 10 Î¼g/ml. Plates are incubated at 37Â° C. for 24 hours, followed by harvesting of the supernatant and removal of 50 Î¼l for use in an IL-6 ELISA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ELISA for detection of human IL-6 is performed as follows. Reagents are generally from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn., USA). An hIL-6 capture antibody (50 Î¼l/well of a 4 Î¼g/ml solution) is transferred to wells of a microtiter plate, which is sealed and incubated overnight at 4Â° C. The plate is washed three times, and then blocked with 100 Î¼l/well of blocking buffer for 1 hour or more The plate is then washed again three times. Experimental samples (50 Î¼l of the culture supernatant) and controls (serial dilutions of IL-6 protein) are added to the wells in 50 Î¼l and incubated for two hours. Plates are washed three times, and 50 Î¼l/well of a biotinylated anti-IL-6 detection antibody (300 ng/ml) is added. The plates are incubated at room temperature for two hours, washed three times, and 100 Î¼l/well of streptavidin HRP is added and incubated for 20 minutes. The plate is washed again, ABTS (BioSource, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) is added (100 Î¼l/well), and incubated for 20 minutes. Stop solution is added (100 Î¼l/well) and the absorbance at 405 nm is measured.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IC50 for an anti-IL-17A antibody of interest is the concentration of antibody required to reduce the level of rhIL-17A-induced IL-6 production to 50% of the level observed in the absence of any added anti-IL-17A antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are provided at Table 12.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-IL-17A Antibody Inhibition of IL-6 Production in NHDF Cells\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\ncyno IL-17A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 4C3\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 30C10\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 6C3\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nrat 1D10\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nrat 8G9\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nrat 12B12\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nrat 18H6\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n23E12\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29G3\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n29H1\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12E6\n\n\n>70\n\n\n>70\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 10\n\n\nForeskin Fibroblast Assay Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention to block the biological activity of IL-17A is measured by monitoring rhIL-17A-induced expression of IL-6 in HS68 foreskin fibroblast cell line. Reduced production of IL-6 in response to rhIL-17A is used as a measure of blocking activity by anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis of the expression of IL-17RC (an IL-17A receptor) in a panel of fibroblast cell lines identified the human foreskin fibroblast cell line HS68 (ATCC CRL1635) as a potential IL-17A responsive cell line. This was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence staining with polyclonal goat anti-human IL-17R antibody (R&D Systems, Gaithersburg, Md., USA) followed by phycoerythrin (PE)-F(abâ²)\n2 \ndonkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, Inc., West Grove, Pa., USA), and analyzing the PE immunofluorescence signal on a flow cytometer (FACScan, Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J., USA). As further validation of the model, IL-17A (both adenovirus-derived rhIL-17A and commercially available \nE. coli\n-derived IL-17A, R&D Systems) induced a dose-responsive induction of IL-6 in the HS68 cells with an EC50 of 5-10 ng/ml, which induction was blocked by pre-incubation with commercial polyclonal and monoclonal anti-IL-17A antibodies (R&D Systems).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe IL-17A inhibition assay is performed as follows. A confluent T-75 flask of HS68 cells (approximately 2Ã10\n6 \ncells) is washed with Dulbecco's PBS without Ca++ and Mg++ and then incubated with 5 ml of cell dissociation medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA) for 2-5 minutes at 37Â° C. in an incubator at 5% CO\n2\n. Cells are then harvested with 5 ml of tissue culture (TC) medium and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1000 rpm. TC medium is Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (with glutamine), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cells are resuspended in 2 ml TC medium, diluted 1:1 with trypan blue and counted. Cell concentrations are adjusted to 1Ã10\n5 \ncells/ml in TC medium, and 0.1 ml/well is aliquoted into the wells of a flat-bottom plate containing 0.1 ml TC medium. Cells are grown overnight and the supernatant is aspirated and cells are washed with 0.2 ml of fresh TC medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IL-17A antibodies to be assayed are serially diluted in two-fold or 3-fold steps to give a series of stock solutions that can be used to create final antibody concentrations of 1 to 0.001 Î¼g/ml in the IL-17A inhibition assay. A rat IgG control is used in each assay, as well as media-only samples, as controls to measure spontaneous IL-6 production in HS68 cells. The TC medium is aspirated from the wells of the plate containing the HS68 cells. Aliquots of the various concentrations of anti-IL-17A antibody (0.1 ml of each) are pre-incubated in the wells with the HS68 cells 37Â° C. for 5 minutes prior to addition of 0.1 ml of 20 ng/ml rhIL-17A, to give a final concentration of rhIL-17A of 10 ng/ml (approximately 330 pM of IL-17A dimer). Cells are incubated 24 hours at 37Â° C., and supernatants (50-100 Î¼l) are harvested and assayed for IL-6, for example using a human IL-6 ELISA kit from Pharmingen (OptEIAâBD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, N.J., USA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults for several rat anti-human IL-17A antibodies of the present invention in the foreskin fibroblast IL-17A inhibition assay are provided at Table 13.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeskin Fibroblast Assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nanti-IL-17A antibody\n\n\nIC50 (pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\n67\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 8G9\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 29H1\n\n\n247\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 29G3\n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 23E12\n\n\n126\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 6C3\n\n\n192\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat 4C2\n\n\n107\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nrat IgG1\n\n\nno binding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 11\n\n\nBa/F3-hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR Proliferation Assay\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention to block the biological activity of IL-17A is measured by monitoring rhIL-17A-induced proliferation of a cell line engineered to proliferate in response to IL-17A stimulation. Specifically, the Ba/F3 cell line (IL-3 dependent murine pro-B cells) was modified to express a fusion protein comprising the extracellular domain of a human IL-17A receptor (hIL-17RC) fused to the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic region of mouse granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (GCSFR). The resulting cell line is referred to herein as Ba/F3 hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR. Binding of homodimeric IL-17A to the extracellular IL-17RC domains causes dimerization of the hIL-17Rc-mGCFR fusion protein receptor, which signals proliferation of the Ba/F3 cells via their mGCSFR cytoplasmic domains. Such cells proliferate in response to IL-17A, providing a convenient assay for IL-17A inhibitors, such as anti-IL-17A antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sensitivity of the Ba/F3-hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR proliferation assay to IL-17A stimulation makes it possible to perform experiments at relatively low concentrations of rhIL-17A (e.g. 3 ng/ml, 100 pM) compared with other assays, while still maintaining a robust and readily measurable proliferative response. This means that lower concentrations of anti-IL-17A antibodies are required to achieve a molar excess over rhIL-17A in the assay. Experiments performed at lower antibody concentrations make it possible to discriminate between high affinity antibodies that might otherwise be indistinguishable (i.e. experiments can be performed closer to the linear range in the antibody-IL-17A binding curve, rather than in the plateau).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies and IL-17A were filtered through 0.22 Î¼m filters after dilution to working stock concentrations but prior to addition to experimental samples. Four sets of samples were prepared, in duplicate, across rows of a 96-well flat bottom tissue culture plates. As used in this Example, Growth Medium is RPMI 1640 w/Glutamax (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA), 55 Î¼M 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% formula fed Bovine Calf Serum (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, Calif., USA), 50 Î¼g/mL gentamicin, 2 Î¼g/mL puromycin, and 10 ng/mL mIL-3 BioAssay Medium is the same as Growth Medium but without puromycin and mIL-3. All serial dilutions in this Example were made into BioAssay Medium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following experimental samples (75 Î¼l) were prepared: 1) a serial dilution of Growth Medium (including 10 ng/ml mIL-3); 2) a serial dilution of rhIL-17A; 3) a serial dilution of anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention mixed with 3 ng/ml IL-17A (final concentration after cells were added), including a âno antibodyâ control; and 4) a âcells onlyâ control with no added antibodies, IL-17A or mIL-3. Ba/F3 hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR cells (7500 cells/well) were then added to bring the total volume to 100 Î¼l/well, and the plates were incubated at 37Â° C./5% CO\n2 \nfor approximately 40 hours. AlamarBlueÂ® indicator dye (11 Î¼l/well) was added and the plates were incubated at 37Â° C./5% CO\n2 \nfor 6-8 hours. Plates were then read for the difference in absorbance at 570 nm and 600 nm. IC50 values were determined using nonlinear fit/sigmoidal dose-response/variable slope.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results of the Ba/F3 hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR proliferation assay are provided at Table 14.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBa/F3 hIL-17Rc-mGCSFR Proliferation Assay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmAb\n\n\nIL-17A\n\n\n[rhIL-17A](pM)\n\n\nIC50(pM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n100\n\n\n20 Â± 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n276\n\n\n162\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 16C10\n\n\n \ncyno\n \n\n\n100\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchimeric 16C10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n100\n\n\n29\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n100\n\n\n15 Â± 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n100\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVH N54Q/M96A\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n100\n\n\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n276\n\n\n149\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10\n\n\ncyno\n\n\n100\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhu 16C10 N54Q/M96A/M100hF\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n100\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 1D10\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n276\n\n\n223\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nrat 1D10\n \n \ncyno\n \n \n\n\n100\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 29H1\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n28\n\n\nâ§30\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 4H12\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n28\n\n\nâ§400\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrat 29G3\n\n\nhuman\n\n\n28\n\n\nâ§400\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 12\n\n\nCross-Blocking of Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nDifferent anti-IL-17A antibodies of the invention may bind to the same epitope, epitopes that overlap, or epitopes that do not overlap, including epitopes that are sufficiently distinct that two or more antibodies can bind to one IL-17A monomer simultaneously. Antibodies that bind to portions of IL-17A critical to receptor binding will block the receptor-mediated biological activity of IL-17A. Such antibodies are referred to herein as âneutralizing antibodies.â Antibodies that bind but do not block receptor binding are referred to as non-neutralizing antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen performing experiments on IL-17A and anti-IL-17A antibodies it is useful to be able to determine the level of IL-17A (or anti-IL-17A) in a sample, such as by a sandwich ELISA. See, e.g., Example 6. In one format, an IL-17A ELISA involves coating the wells of a microtiter plate with a capture antibody, addition of an experimental sample possibly containing IL-17A, and binding of a detection antibody. The capture antibody and the detection antibody must be able to bind IL-17A at the same time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar assay may be used to determine the level of an anti-IL-17A antibody, wherein a standard solution of IL-17A is bound to the wells coated with capture antibody, followed by addition of a an experimental sample possibly containing an anti-IL-17A antibody, and binding of a secondary detection antibody (e.g. an anti-human IgG antibody in the case of IgG humanized antibodies of the present invention). As in the IL-17A sandwich ELISA, the capture antibody cannot interfere with binding of the antibody to be assayed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred pairs of antibodies for use in the ELISA experiments outlined in this Example can be determined by performing cross-blocking experiments. In cross blocking experiments, a first antibody is coated onto the wells of a microtiter plate. A biotinylated second antibody is then mixed with IL-17A and allowed to bind, after which the mixture is added to the coated well and incubated. The biotinylated second antibody may be added at various concentrations (i.e. titrated) to ensure that in at least some samples the antibody is present at a two-fold (or greater) molar excess over homodimeric IL-17A. The plate is then washed and the presence or absence of the biotinylated second antibody bound in the well is determined by standard methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the two antibodies cross-block there will be a reduction of signal (IL-17A binding) to the plate in the presence of the second anti-IL-17A antibody compared with control samples containing no second anti-IL-17A antibody (or containing an isotype control). Pairs of antibodies that do not cross-block can be used together in assays, such as sandwich ELISAs. Although the dimeric nature of IL-17A makes it possible to use pairs of cross-blocking antibodies in ELISAs in certain formats (e.g. where IL-17A is bound to the capture antibody on the plate prior to addition of the detection antibody), non-cross-blocking pairs of antibodies are generally preferable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention (clones 4C3, 6C3, 8G9, 12E6, 16C10, 18H6, 23E12, 29H1, 30C10, 1D10, 21B12, 29G3) were tested pairwise for cross-blocking. All pairs cross-blocked with the exception of 29G3/1D10 and 29G3/21B12, which pairs of antibodies could therefore be used in ELISAs. In addition to identifying pairs of anti-IL-17A antibodies that can be used in an ELISA, these results show that the epitope bound by antibody 29G3 is functionally or physically distinct from the epitope or epitopes bound by antibodies 1D10 and 21B12. These data also demonstrated that the epitopes for 1D10 and 21B12 overlap with, but are not identical to, the epitope for 16C10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch pairs of anti-IL-17A antibodies that bind to functionally distinct epitopes are useful, e.g., in validating anti-IL-17A immunohistochemistry (IHC). For example, if a tissue sample exhibits the same pattern of IL-17A expression in IHC performed with two different anti-IL-17A antibodies that bind to functionally distinct epitopes then it is even more likely that the assay is detecting IL-17A, rather than some other spurious cross-reacting protein in the tissue sample.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch pairs of non-cross-blocking antibodies are also useful in designing ELISAs for detection of IL-17A in the presence of therapeutic anti-IL-17A antibodies, e.g. in samples from patients undergoing anti-IL-17A antibody therapy, in which the presence of an excess of the therapeutic anti-IL-17A antibody would block detection by anti-IL-17A ELISA unless the ELISA antibodies were non-cross-blocking with the therapeutic antibody.\n\n\n \nExample 13\n\n\nGene Therapy with Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe anti-IL-17A antibodies of the invention may also be administered to a subject by gene therapy. In a gene therapy approach, the cells of a subject are transformed with nucleic acids that encode the antibodies of the invention. Subjects comprising the nucleic acids will then produce the antibody molecules (intrabodies) endogenously. For example, Alvarez et al. introduced single-chain anti-ErbB2 antibodies to subjects using a gene therapy approach. Alvarez et al. (2000) \nClinical Cancer Research \n6:3081-3087. The methods disclosed by Alvarez et al. may be easily adapted for the introduction of nucleic acids encoding an anti-IL-17A antibody molecule of the present invention to a subject. In one embodiment, the antibody molecule introduced by gene therapy is a fully human, single-chain antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gene therapy approach described herein has the potential advantage that treatment need only be carried out once, or at most a limited number of times, provided that long-term gene expression is achieved. This is contrasted with antibody administration, which must be repeated periodically to maintain proper therapeutic levels in the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acids may be introduced to the cells of a subject by any means known in the art. In some embodiments, the nucleic acids are introduced as part of a viral vector. Examples of viruses from which the vectors may be derived include lentiviruses, herpes viruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses (AAV), vaccinia virus, baculovirus, alphavirus, influenza virus, and other recombinant viruses with desirable cellular tropism. Various companies produce viral vectors commercially, for example Avigen, Inc. (Alameda, Calif.; AAV vectors); Cell Genesys (Foster City, Calif.; retroviral, adenoviral, AAV vectors, and lentiviral vectors); Clontech (retroviral and baculoviral vectors); Genovo, Inc. (Sharon Hill, Pa.; adenoviral and AAV vectors); Genvec (adenoviral vectors); IntroGene (Leiden, Netherlands; adenoviral vectors); Molecular Medicine (retroviral, adenoviral, AAV, and herpes viral vectors); Norgen (adenoviral vectors); Oxford BioMedica (Oxford, United Kingdom; lentiviral vectors); and Transgene (Strasbourg, France; adenoviral, vaccinia, retroviral, and lentiviral vectors).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of constructing and using viral vectors are known in the art (see, e.g., Miller et al. (1992) \nBioTechniques \n7:980-990). Preferably, the viral vectors are replication defective (unable to replicate autonomously) and thus not infectious in the target cell. Preferably, the replication defective virus is a minimal virus retaining only the sequences of its genome that are necessary for encapsidating the genome to produce viral particles. Defective viruses that entirely or almost entirely lack viral genes are most preferred. Use of defective viral vectors allows for administration to cells in a specific localized area without concern that the vector can infect other cells, enabling tissue-specific targeting. See, e.g., Kanno et al. (1999) \nCancer Gen. Ther. \n6:147-154; Kaplitt et al. (1997) \nJ. Neurosci. Meth. \n71:125-132; and Kaplitt et al. (1994) \nJ. Neuro\n-\nOnc. \n19:137-142.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdenoviruses are eukaryotic DNA viruses that can be modified to efficiently deliver a nucleic acid of the invention to a variety of cell types. Attenuated adenovirus vectors, such as the vector described by Stratford-Perricaudet et al. (1992) (\nJ. Clin. Invest. \n90:626-630) are desirable in some instances. Various replication defective adenovirus and minimal adenovirus vectors have been described (PCT Publication Nos. WO94/26914, WO94/28938, WO94/28152, WO94/12649, WO95/02697 and WO96/22378). The replication defective recombinant adenoviruses of the present invention can be prepared by any technique known to a person skilled in the art (see Levrero et al. (1991) Gene 101:195; EP 185573; Graham (1984) \nEMBO J. \n3:2917; Graham et al. (1977) \nJ. Gen. Virol. \n36:59).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdeno-associated viruses (AAV) are DNA viruses of relatively small size that can integrate, in a stable and site-specific manner, into the genome of the cells that they infect. They are able to infect a wide spectrum of cells without inducing any effects on cellular growth, morphology or differentiation, and they do not appear to be involved in human pathologies. The use of AAV-derived vectors for transferring genes in vitro and in vivo has been described (see Donsante et al. (2001) \nGene Ther. \n8:1343-1346; Larson et al. (2001) \nAdv. Exp. Med. Bio. \n489:45-57; PCT Publication Nos. WO91/18088 and WO93/09239; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,797,368 and 5,139,941; and EP 488528B1).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the gene can be introduced in a retroviral vector, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,399,346, 4,650,764, 4,980,289, and 5,124,263; Mann et al. (1983) \nCell \n33:153; Markowitz et al. (1988) \nJ. Virol. \n62:1120; EP 453242 and EP178220. Retroviruses are integrating viruses that infect dividing cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLentiviral vectors can be used as agents for the direct delivery and sustained expression of nucleic acids encoding an antibody molecule of the invention in several tissue types, including brain, retina, muscle, liver and blood. The vectors can efficiently transduce dividing and nondividing cells in these tissues, and maintain long-term expression of the antibody molecule. For a review, see Zufferey et al. (1998) \nJ. Virol. \n72:9873-80 and Kafri et al. (2001) \nCurr. Opin. Mol. Ther. \n3:316-326. Lentiviral packaging cell lines are available and known generally in the art, facilitating the production of high-titer lentivirus vectors for gene therapy. An example is a tetracycline-inducible VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus packaging cell line which can generate virus particles at titers greater than 10\n6 \nIU/ml for at least 3 to 4 days; see Kafri et al. (1999) \nJ. Virol. \n73: 576-584. The vector produced by the inducible cell line can be concentrated as needed for efficiently transducing nondividing cells in vitro and in vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSindbis virus is a member of the alphavirus genus that has been studied extensively since its discovery in various parts of the world beginning in 1953. Gene transduction based on alphavirus, particularly Sindbis virus, has been well-studied in vitro (see Straus et al. (1994) \nMicrobiol. Rev. \n58:491-562; Bredenbeek et al. (1993) J. Virol. 67; 6439-6446; Iijima et al. (1999) \nInt. J. Cancer \n80:110-118; and Sawai et al. (1998) \nBiochim. Biophys. Res. Comm. \n248:315-323). Many properties of alphavirus vectors make them a desirable alternative to other virus-derived vector systems being developed, including rapid engineering of expression constructs, production of high-titered stocks of infectious particles, infection of nondividing cells, and high levels of expression (Strauss et al. (1994) \nMicrobiol. Rev. \n58:491-562). Use of Sindbis virus for gene therapy has been described. (Wahlfors et al. (2000) \nGene. Ther. \n7:472-480 and Lundstrom (1999) \nJ. Recep. Sig. Transduct. Res. \n19(1-4):673-686).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, a vector can be introduced to cells by lipofection or with other transfection facilitating agents (peptides, polymers, etc.). Synthetic cationic lipids can be used to prepare liposomes for in vivo and in vitro transfection of a gene encoding a marker (Felgner et al. (1987) \nProc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA \n84:7413-7417 and Wang et al. (1987) \nProc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA \n84:7851-7855). Useful lipid compounds and compositions for transfer of nucleic acids are described in PCT Publication Nos. WO 95/18863 and WO96/17823, and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,127.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible to introduce the vector in vivo as a naked DNA plasmid. Naked DNA vectors for gene therapy can be introduced into the desired host cells by methods known in the art, e.g., electroporation, microinjection, cell fusion, DEAE dextran, calcium phosphate precipitation, use of a gene gun, or use of a DNA vector transporter (see, e.g., Wilson et al. (1992) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n267:963-967; Williams et al. (1991) \nProc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA \n88:2726-2730). Receptor-mediated DNA delivery approaches can also be used (Wu et al. (1988) \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n263:14621-14624). U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,580,859 and 5,589,466 disclose delivery of exogenous DNA sequences, free of transfection facilitating agents, in a mammal. A relatively low voltage, high efficiency in vivo DNA transfer technique, termed electrotransfer, has also been described (Vilquin et al. (2001) \nGene Ther. \n8:1097; Payen et al. (2001) \nExp. Hematol. \n29:295-300; Mir (2001) \nBioelectrochemistry \n53:1-10; PCT Publication Nos. WO99/01157, WO99/01158 and WO99/01175).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe gene therapy methods outlined herein may be carried out in vivo, or they may be performed ex vivo, in which cells are obtained from a subject, transformed with a gene therapy method in vitro, and subsequently reintroduced into the subject. See, e.g., Worgall (2005) \nPediatr. Nephrol. \n20(2):118-24.\n\n\n \nExample 14\n\n\nCassette Mutagenesis of CDRs of Parental Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nOptimization of the CDR sequences of anti-human IL-17A antibodies of the present invention (e.g. 16C10) is performed using shotgun scanning mutagenesis. Alanine scanning mutagenesis is used to determine which residues within the CDRs are most critical to IL-17A binding (see Example 19). The codon for one or more residues within one or more CDRs is replaced with an alanine codon, or an alanine codon is replace with a glycine codon, and the resulting antibody is tested for a relevant activity (e.g. IL-17A binding affinity, IC50 for receptor blocking in a competition assay, bioassay, as provided in various other Examples herein). Codon substitution may be performed by any method known in the art, including but not limited to site-directed mutagenesis (e.g. Kunkel, \nProc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA \n(1985) 82:488) and PCR mutagenesis. Residues crucial to IL-17A binding may also be determined by inspection of the structure of an IL-17A-antibody complex, e.g. an X-ray crystal structure. Antibody CDR residues within contact distance of IL-17A, or which are substantially buried in formation of the IL-17A-antibody complex, are candidates for further optimization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThose residues with the greatest sensitivity to mutation are then studied further, for example by homolog scanning mutagenesis. In this embodiment, conservative amino acid substitutions with homologous amino acids are performed at the target residues to search for antibodies with superior qualities. Non-conservative mutations are also possible, albeit at the risk of disrupting IL-17A binding altogether.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, improved antibody sequences may be generated using affinity maturation, in which selected residues in a CDR are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at that position. In another embodiment, fewer than all 20 possible natural amino acids are used as substitutions to reduce the number of potential sequences to more manageable levels, while still providing for chemical diversity at each position using a limited number of amino acids selected to be optimally diverse (e.g. representative hydrophobic, polar-uncharged, basic and acidic amino acids), as in WO2005/044853. Such affinity maturation can be performed by substitution with any number of amino acids at a position of interest, including 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or even more if non-standard or modified amino acids are included.\n\n\n \nExample 15\n\n\nCross-Reactivity with Human Tissue\n\n\n \n \n \nThe propensity of humanized anti-human IL-17A antibody hu16C10 to cross-reactivity with non-target tissues in human subjects was assessed as follows. hu16C10 was preincubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody to form a pre-complex prior to exposure to tissue samples. Antibody complexes (with 20 Î¼g/ml of antibody) were then mixed with a tissue or other sample and incubated to allow binding. Bound secondary antibodies were then detected using ABC immunoperoxidase detection (Vector Labs, Burlingame, Calif., USA). Tuson et al. (1990) \nJ. Histochem Cytochem. \n38(7):923-6. A sample with an unrelated human IgG1 antibody was included as a negative control.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImmunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed with hu16C10 against several positive control target tissues including rhIL-17A protein spots on UV-resin slides (Adhesive Coated Slides, Instrumedics, Inc., St. Louis, Mo., USA), mouse liver cells infected with an adenovirus-encoding IL-17A, and human rheumatoid arthritis tissue. IHC revealed binding (+++) in all three positive controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIHC was then performed against a panel of human tissues (32 in all) to assess cross-reactivity. All these human tissue samples were mounted on UV-resin slides. Samples were obtained from three donors for each tissue. The human tissues screened were adrenal gland, bladder, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, colon, fallopian tube, cardiac muscle, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, mammary gland, ovary, pancreas, parathyroid, pituitary gland, placenta, prostate, retina, skeletal muscle, skin, small intestine, spinal cord, spleen, stomach, testis, thymus, thyroid gland, ureter, uterus, and cervix (uterus). IHC was negative in all 32 tissues.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis lack of cross-reactivity has several potential benefits in therapeutic uses of the anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention, such as reducing the loss of antibody due to non-specific binding to other tissues (with consequent reduction in therapeutic effect), and reducing the likelihood of adverse effects associated with binding to undesired tissues.\n\n\n \nExample 16\n\n\nTreatment of Collagen-Induced Arthritis Using Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nCollagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is a widely accepted mouse model for rheumatoid arthritis in humans. Anti-IL-17A antibody 1D10 of the present invention (the parental rat antibody, rather than a humanized forms thereof) is administered to mice expressing CIA to assess the ability of anti-IL-17A therapy to treat rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe procedure was as follows. On \nDay\n 0 male B10.RIII mice were immunized intradermally at the tail base with bovine type II collagen emulsified in Complete Freund's Adjuvant. On Day 21 mice were challenged intradermally with bovine type II collagen emulsified in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant delivered at the tail base. When the first sign of severe arthritis in the immunized group occurred (post-Day 21), all remaining immunized mice were randomized to the various treatment groups. Animals were treated with either 800 Î¼g, 200 Î¼g, or 50 Î¼g of anti-IL-17A antibody 1D10; 200 Î¼g isotype control antibody; or diluent. Treatments were given subcutaneously on the first day of disease onset in the immunized mice, and then weekly four more times. Mice were sacrificed at day 35 and paws were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for tissue processing and sectioning. Paws were analyzed by a pathologist for the following histopathology parameters: reactive synovium, inflammation, pannus formation, cartilage destruction, bone erosion, and bone formation. Each parameter was graded using the following disease scale: 0=no disease; 1=minimal, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe. In addition paws were assessed using visual disease severity score (DSS), which measures swelling and redness on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 being a normal paw, 1 being inflammation of one finger on the paw, 2 being inflammation of two fingers or the palm of that paw, and 3 being inflammation of the palm and finger(s) of the paw. Scores of 2 and 3 are referred to herein as severely or highly inflamed paws.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are presented at \nFIGS. 3A-3C\n. Each data point represents one paw, rather than an average for all four paws for an animal or an average over all animals. Reduction in the number of paws showing high pathology scores was statistically significant by three measures of pathology (visual DSSâpaw swelling and redness, cartilage damage and bone erosion) with higher anti-IL-17A 1D10 concentrations tested (28 and 7 mg/kg). Results with the lowest concentration (2 mg/kg) were statistically significant for bone erosion and reduced for visual DSS and cartilage damage. Similar benefits were observed in reduction of production of cartilage degradative enzymes within inflamed paws (matrix metalloproteases MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-13).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVisual evaluation of paw inflammation, however, may underestimate the therapeutic benefit of anti-IL-17A treatment of CIA mice, e.g. decreased bone erosion. In other experiments, highly inflamed paws (DSS scores of 2 or 3) from CIA mice were analyzed for bone erosion using histopathology or micro-computed tomography (micro-CT). This study was possible because even though anti-IL-17A-treated animals had drastically reduced percentages of highly inflamed paws (see, e.g., \nFIG. 3A\n), there remained a number of highly inflamed paws, and it was possible to compare highly inflamed paws (DSS=2 or 3) from all treatment groups, including the no-antibody controls. \nFIG. 3D\n shows a plot of bone erosion for highly inflamed paws from diluent treated, isotype control (rIgG1) treated, and anti-IL-17A antibody treated animals. Bone erosion, as measured by histopathology, was significantly reduced in paws from animals treated with anti-IL-17A when compared with no-antibody controls, despite their similar DSS scores. The results suggest that sparing of bone erosion may be achieved with anti-IL-17A treatment even in paws where there is no apparent improvement in inflammation as measured by DSS score.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimilar results were obtained when micro-CT was used to measure bone mineral density (BMD) for joints in highly inflamed paws in CIA mice. Table 15 provides BMD for paws with disease severity scores of 0 or 3 from CIA animals treated with either an anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention (1D10) or an isotype control (25D2). Even for joints with the same visual disease severity, 1D10 antibody treated had only approximately half the decrease in bone mineral density observed with isotype control treated animals.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBone Density for Joints in CIA Mice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTreatment\n\n\nDSS\n\n\nBMD (mg/cc)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n25D2\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n25D2\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n108\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n1D10\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n288\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n1D10\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n299\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n1D10\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n502\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n1D10\n \n\n\n0\n\n\n480\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs with bone erosion, cartilage destruction and pannus formation (proliferation of the synovial lining forming excessive folds of inflamed tissue) were also reduced in anti-hIL-17A (1D10)-treated CIA mice. Histopathology showed that anti-IL-17A antibody treatment not only reduced the number of paws showing severe pathology, but also reduced pathology in paws that appeared equally inflamed based on visual inspection (DSS scores of 2 and 3) when compared with diluent or isotype treated controls.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe observation that treatment with anti-IL-17A antibodies significantly reduced bone erosion in the CIA model of joint inflammation suggests that such therapy may be useful in preventing one of the most debilitating and irreversible effects of RA in humans. In addition, the observation that bone erosion is reduced even in highly inflamed paws suggests that simple visual assessment of joint inflammation may not accurately measure therapeutic efficacy in the lab, or ultimately in the clinic. Measurement of bone erosion may be necessary to track the effects of therapeutic treatments. Such methods include, but are not limited to, standard 2-D X-ray detection, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), and scintigraphy. See, e.g., Guermazi et al. (2004) \nSemin. Musculoskelet. Radiol. \n8(4):269-285.\n\n\n \nExample 17\n\n\nBAL Neutrophil Recruitment Assay of Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention to block the activity of IL-17A in vivo was assessed in a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophil recruitment assay. Briefly, at day â4, five week old female BALB/cAnN mice (Taconic Farms, Germantown, N.Y., USA) were treated with anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention, or an isotype control, by subcutaneous injection of 0, 10, 30, 40, 60, or 100 Î¼g of antibody per mouse. At day â1 the mice were stimulated by nasal administration of 1 Î¼g of rhIL-17A in 50 Î¼l of PBS (or a PBS only control) under light isoflurane anesthesia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt \nday\n 0 the level of neutrophils present in BAL fluid was determined as follows. Mice were euthanized with CO\n2 \nand blood samples were collected, from which the concentration of anti-IL-17A antibody was determined. A needle was inserted into the upper cervical trachea through a tracheotomy and BAL fluid was collected by introduction and removal of 0.3 ml of PBS three times. The BAL fluid was centrifuged (400Ãg for 10 minutes at 4Â° C.) and the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS. Total cell counts were determined in a hemocytometer using trypan blue solution. Differential cell counts were performed on cytospin preparations by Wright-Giemsa staining (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA), according to standard morphologic criteria with use of oil immersion microscopy (original magnification Ã1000). Cell counts were carried out on 200 or 300 cells (lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils) to determine the percent BAL neutrophil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResults are provided at \nFIG. 4\n. Data are provided for three anti-IL-17A antibodies of the present invention (1D10, 16C10 and 4C3), as well as controls. The percentage of neutrophils in BAL fluid as a percentage of all leukocytes for individual experimental animals is plotted as a function of serum antibody concentration, with the left segment of the abscissa (â0â to â1â) representing controls, as indicated in the legend. The controls show that rhIL-17A stimulus induces significant neutrophil recruitment that is not reduced by administration of an isotype control antibody (dosed at the same levels as the anti-IL-17A antibodies). In contrast, the anti-IL-17A data show a dose-dependent reduction in rhIL-17A-induced neutrophil recruitment, with neutrophil recruitment essentially blocked at serum antibody concentrations above 40-60 Î¼g/ml.\n\n\n \nExample 18\n\n\nTreatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Using Anti-IL-17A Antibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nHuman subjects diagnosed with RA who have had an inadequate response to one or more DMARDs are selected for treatment with a humanized anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention. Subjects are maintained on methotrexate (10 mg/week), and are optionally treated with prednisone for two weeks. Subjects are also dosed monthly with 50 or 100 mg of anti-IL-17A antibody, administered subcutaneously. Doses are adjusted for specific subjects according to standard clinical criteria and on the basis of clinical response.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nResponse to treatment is assessed by determining the ACR score, which is based on criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology. The ACR score is a composite score that integrates multiple clinical parameters and radiographic scores, such as reduction in the number of swollen and tender joints, patient global assessment, physician global assessment, pain scale, self-assessed disability, and acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein). See Felson et al. (1995) \nArthritis \n& \nRheumatology \n38; 727-735. A subject is considered to have improved if he or she exhibits a score of ACR20 or higher at week 24 or treatment. In addition, the proportion of subjects achieving various ACR scores (e.g. ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70) can be used to compare treatment and placebo groups in clinical trials to assess the clinical efficacy of the humanized anti-IL-17A antibody of the present invention\n\n\n \nExample 19\n\n\nEpitope Determination\n\n\n \n \n \nAmino acid residues critical to binding of the antibodies of the present invention, e.g. rat 16C10, were determined a follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA first set of experiments was based on the observation that rat antibody 16C10 was able to bind human IL-17A (hIL-17A) but was unable to bind mouse IL-17A (mIL-17A) or related cytokine human IL-17F. Each of these three proteins was linked to an N-terminal FLAGÂ® peptide tag (see \nresidues\n 1 to 9 of SEQ ID NO.: 42). In order to identify amino acid residues critical for 16C10 binding, various peptide subsequences of FLAG-tagged hIL-17A, mIL-17A and IL-17F were combined by mixing restriction fragments of the relevant genes to form hybrid polypeptides. Binding of these hybrid polypeptides to antibody 16C10 was determined in an Amplified Luminescent Proximity Homogeneous Assay (AlphaScreen, Packard BioScience, Wellesley, Mass., USA) to determine which segments of hIL-17A were critical to binding. Biotinylated antibody 16C10 was bound to streptavidin donor beads, and hybrid polypeptides were bound to acceptor beads having anti-FLAGÂ® antibodies (Packard BioScience). Donor and acceptor beads were mixed, illuminated at 680 nm, and emission was measured at 520-620 nm. Binding was measured as enhanced fluorescence in samples containing hybrid polypeptides that bound to antibody 16C10 because acceptor beads were held in close proximity to donor beads and emitted light when singlet oxygen from the exited donor bead diffused to the acceptor bead.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results showed that antibody 16C10 binds to hybrid polypeptides comprising amino acid residues 50-132, 63-132, 1-87, 1-112 and 63-87 from hIL-17A, demonstrating that residues critical to 16C10 binding are present in residues 63-87 of hIL-17A (PSVIWEAKCR HLGCINADG NVDYHM). All residue numbering in this example is with reference to the sequence of hIL-17A (SEQ ID NO.: 40). For example, mIL-17A and IL-17F polypeptides substituted with residues 63-87 of hIL-17A were able to bind antibody 16C10, whereas the intact mIL-17A and IL-17F were not.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPoint mutations were also introduced into hIL-17A to determine which amino acid residues were critical to antibody 16C10 binding. In one experiment, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was performed in which an alanine codon was introduced in place of the native amino acid at several residues (45, 46, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 60, 61, 62, 67, 68, 70, 72, 73, 78, 80, 82, 84, 85, 86, 88, 93, 94, 95, 100, 101, 102, 105, 108, 110, 111, 113, 114). Mammalian expression plasmids with genes encoding the mutant forms of hIL-17A were transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. The supernatants were analyzed for FLAGÂ® peptide tag quantification and for antibody 16C10 binding by AlphaScreen, as described supra. None of the single amino acid alanine substitutions significantly reduced binding of antibody 16C10. Other point mutations were made in which human IL-17F or mouse IL-17A residues were substituted at various positions within the 63-87 fragment, i.e. L74Q, G75R, V83E, Y85H. Although none of these individual point mutations inhibited antibody 16C10 binding, an hIL-17A. having all four changes exhibited substantially decreased binding, confirming that residues in the 63-87 fragment of hIL-17A, and more specifically residues in the 74-85 fragment (LGCINADGNVDY), are important for 16C10 binding.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSequence Identifiers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEQ ID NO:\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nhu 16C10 light chain DNA with signal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nhu 16C10 light chain amino acid with signal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nhu 16C10 heavy chain DNA with signal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nhu 16C10 heavy chain amino acid with signal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nhu 16C10/4C3 light chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nhu 16C10/4C3 heavy chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nrat 16C10 light chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nrat 16C10/4C3 heavy chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nchimeric 16C10 light chain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nchimeric 16C10 heavy chain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nrat/hu 16C10/4C3 CDRL1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nrat/hu 16C10/4C3 CDRL2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nrat/hu 16C10/4C3 CDRL3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nrat/hu 16C10/4C3 CDRH1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nrat 16C10/4C3 CDRH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nhu 16C10/4C3 CDRH2 (N54Q)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nrat 16C10 CDRH2 (N54N/Q/A)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nrat 16C10/4C3 CDRH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nhu 16C10/4C3 CDRH3 (M96A)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nrat 16C10 CDRH3 (M96M/A/K, M100hM/F)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\nrat 4C3 light chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\nhu 30C10 light chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\nhu 30C10 heavy chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n24\n\n\nrat 30C10 light chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n\nrat 30C10 heavy chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26\n\n\nrat/hu 30C10 CDRL1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27\n\n\nrat/hu 30C10 CDRL2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\nrat/hu 30C10 CDRL3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29\n\n\nrat/hu 30C10 CDRH1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\nrat/hu 30C10 CDRH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n\nrat/hu 30C10 CDRH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\nrat 12E6 light chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n33\n\n\nrat 12E6 heavy chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n34\n\n\nrat/hu 12E6 CDRL1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\nrat/hu 12E6 CDRL2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n36\n\n\nrat/hu 12E6 CDRL3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n37\n\n\nrat/hu 12E6 CDRH1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\nrat/hu 12E6 CDRH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n39\n\n\nrat/hu 12E6 CDRH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\nhuIL-17A (native)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n41\n\n\nrhIL-17A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42\n\n\nFLAG-IL-17A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n43\n\n\nR&D IL-17A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n44\n\n\nrat 23E12 light chain variable domain DNA with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsignal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45\n\n\nrat 23E12 light chain variable domain amino acid with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsignal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n46\n\n\nrat 23E12 heavy chain variable domain DNA with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsignal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n47\n\n\nrat 23E12 heavy chain variable domain amino acid with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nsignal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n48\n\n\nrat/hu 23E12 CDRL1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n\nrat/hu 23E12 CDRL2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50\n\n\nrat/hu 23E12 CDRL3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n51\n\n\nrat/hu 23E12 CDRH1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\nrat/hu 23E12 CDRH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n\nrat/hu 23E12 CDRH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n54\n\n\nrat 1D10 light chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n\nrat 1D10 heavy chain variable domain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n56\n\n\nrat 1D10 CDRL1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n57\n\n\nrat 1D10 CDRL2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n58\n\n\nrat 1D10 CDRL3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59\n\n\nrat 1D10 CDRH1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\nrat 1D10 CDRH2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n61\n\n\nrat 1D10 CDRH3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n62\n\n\nhu 16C10 light chain DNA with signal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n63\n\n\nhu 16C10 heavy chain DNA with signal sequence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCitation of the above publications or documents is not intended as an admission that any of the foregoing is pertinent prior art, nor does it constitute any admission as to the contents or date of these publications or documents.

Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to improvements in compositions containing a somatostatin-dopamine conjugate which retains both somatostatin and dopamine activity in vivo, methods for preparing such compositions, and method of using such compositions to treat mammals. In particular, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising Dop2-DLys(Dop2)-cyclo[Cys-Tyr-DTrp-Lys-Abu-Cys]-Thr-NH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO:1), in which the somatostatin-dopamine conjugate precipitates in vivo at physiological pH to form an in situ deposit that is slowly dissolved and released into the body fluid and bloodstream. The present invention may further comprise an organic component such as dimethylacetamide (DMA) or polyethylene glycol with an average molecular weight of 400 (PEG400).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDopamine is a catecholamine neurotransmitter that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of both Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Dopamine and related molecules have been shown to inhibit the growth of several types of malignant tumors in mice, and this activity has been variously attributed to inhibition of tumor-cell proliferation, stimulation of tumor immunity as well as effects on melanin metabolism in malignant melanomas. Recent studies demonstrated the presence of D2 dopamine receptors on endothelial cells. Dopamine has recently been reported to strongly and selectively inhibit at non-toxic levels the vascular permeabilizing and angiogenic activities of VPF/VEGF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSomatostatin (SS), a tetradecapeptide has been shown to have potent inhibitory effects on various secretory processes in tissues such as pituitary, pancreas and gastrointestinal tract. SS also acts as a neuromodulator in the central nervous system. These biological effects of SS, all inhibitory in nature, are elicited through a series of G protein coupled receptors, of which five different subtypes have been characterized (SSTR-1-SSTR-5). These five subtypes have similar affinities for endogenous SS ligands, but have differing distributions in various tissues. Somatostatin binds to the five distinct receptor (SSTR) subtypes with relatively high and equal affinity for each subtype.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is evidence that SS regulates cell proliferation by arresting cell growth via SSTR-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5 subtypes, and/or by inducing apoptosis via SSTR-3 subtype. SS and various analogues have been shown to inhibit normal and neoplastic cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo via specific SS receptors (SSTR's) and possibly different postreceptor actions. In addition, there is evidence that distinct SSTR subtypes are expressed in normal and neoplastic human tissues, conferring different tissue affinities for various SS analogues and variable clinical response to their therapeutic effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBinding to different types of somatostatin receptor subtypes is associated with the treatment of various conditions and/or diseases. For example, the inhibition of growth hormone has been attributed to the somatostatin type-2 receptor (âSSTR-2â), while the inhibition of insulin has been attributed to the somatostatin type-5 receptor (âSSTR-5â). Activation of \n \ntypes\n \n 2 and 5 have been associated with growth hormone suppression and more particularly growth hormone secreting adenomas (acromegaly) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) secreting adenomas. Activation of \ntype\n 5 but not \ntype\n 2 receptor has been associated with treating prolactin secreting adenomas. Other indications associated with activation of the somatostatin receptor subtypes include inhibition of insulin and/or glucagon for treating diabetes mellitus, angiopathy, proliferative retinopathy, dawn phenomenon, and nephropathy; inhibition of gastric acid secretion for treating peptic ulcers, enterocutaneous and pancreaticocutaneous fistula, irritable bowel syndrome, Dumping syndrome, watery diarrhea syndrome, AIDS related diarrhea, chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, acute or chronic pancreatitis and gastrointestinal hormone secreting tumors; treatment of cancer such as hepatoma; inhibition of angiogenesis; treatment of inflammatory disorders such as arthritis; retinopathy; chronic allograft rejection; angioplasty; preventing graft vessel and gastrointestinal bleeding. Preferably, a somatostatin analog is selective for the specific somatostatin receptor subtype or subtypes responsible for the desired biological response to reducing interaction with other receptor subtypes which could lead to undesirable side effects or loss of efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSomatostatin and its receptors (SSTR-1 to SSTR-5) are expressed in normal human parafollicular C cells and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). MTC is a tumor originating from thyroid parafollicular C cells that produce calcitonin (CT), somatostatin, and several other peptides. It was recently demonstrated that SS and SSTR's are expressed in human MTC, and SS and SS analogues were shown to induce a decrease in plasma CT levels and provide symptomatic improvement in MTC patients. Another recent study has shown that SS and SS analogues, in particular, SSTR-1 and SSTR-2, can inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, suggesting that specific SSTR subtypes can function in MTC cell growth regulation. The development and characterization of SSTR subtype analogues that selectively effect MTC cell growth is useful for clinical and therapeutic applications.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a dopamine-somatostatin conjugate.

The Fmoc amino acids used are Fmoc-DLys (Dde)-OH, Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-OH, Fmoc-Tyr(tBu)-OH, Fmoc-DTrp(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Abu-OH and Fmoc-Thr(tBu)âOH, which were purchased from Novabiochem (San Diego, Calif., USA). The synthesis was carried out on a 50 Î¼mol scale. For each reaction cycle, the ACT 396 peptide synthesizer was programmed to perform: (1) washing with NMP twice; (2) removing Fmoc protecting group with 20% piperidine in NMP for 1Ã5 min and 1Ã25 min; (3) washing with NMP twice; and (4) double coupling with 4Ã fold excess of Fmoc protected amino acid (0.20 mmol), HOBt (0.2 mmol), and DIC (0.2 mmol) in DMF for 1 hour per coupling. The resin was coupled successively according to the sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter the peptide chain was assembled, the Fmoc group was removed and the resin was washed completely with NMP and DCM. The resin was transferred into a reaction vessel on a shaker and treated with 2% hydrazine in DMF for 2Ã30 minutes to remove Dde protecting group in the side chain of DLys. After washing successively with DMF, MeOH and DCM, the resin was shaken overnight with a solution of Dop2-OH (54 mg, 3.0 eq), bromo-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBrop, 82 mg, 3.4 eq), 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAT, 0.4 mg, 3.0 eq), pentafluorophenol (18.4 mg, 4 eq), DMAP (0.25 mL of 0.1 M in DMF, 1.0 eq) and DIEA (53 L, 4 eq).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAfter washing successively with DMF, MeOH and DCM, the resin was treated with a mixture of TFA (4.75 mL), H\n2\nO (0.4 mL), and TIS (0.425 mL) for 2 hours. The resin was removed by filtration. The filtrate was poured into 70 mL of ether. The precipitate formed was filtered off and washed thoroughly with ether. This crude product was dissolved in 5 mL of aqueous acetic acid solution (water/acetic acid=1:1). The solution was then diluted with 50 mL of H\n2\nO and 20 mL of acetonitrile, to which was added iodine in methanol until the solution sustained yellow. The solution was stirred slowly for 1 hour and the reaction was terminated by adding aqueous Na\n2\nS\n2\nO\n3 \nsolution. The crude product was purified on reverse-phase preparative HPLC using a column of C18 Dynamax-100A\n0 \n(4Ã43 cm, Varian, Walnut Creek, Calif., USA). The column was eluted with a liner gradient from 90% A and 10% B to 60% A and 40% B in an hour where A was 0.1% TFA in water and B was 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile. Fractions containing a major component by ultraviolet absorption were pooled and lyophilized. The purity was 99.99% based on an analytical HPLC analysis. Electro-spray ionization mass spectrometry (ES-MS) analysis gave the molecular weight at 1693.60 (in agreement with the calculated molecular weight of 1694.23).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe other exemplified somatostatin-dopamine conjugates were synthesized substantially according to the procedure described for the synthesis of Example 1.

Somatostatin analogs are also described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 02210006790. The complete coding sequences of genomic fragments of the SSTR 1 (e.g., Genbank accession No. M81829), SSTR 2 (e.g., Genbank accession No. M81830), SSTR 3 (e.g., Genbank accession No. L07062), and SSTR 4 (e.g., Genbank accession No. AL049651) genes and a cDNA clone for SSTR 5 (e.g., Genbank accession No. D16827) was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV (Life Technologies, Milano, Italy). Other SSTR sequences are known to the skilled artisan. Clonal cell lines stably expressing SSTR's 1-5 were obtained by transfection into CHO-K\n1 \ncells (ATCC, Manassas, Va., USA) using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (Davis L, et al., 1994 In: Basic methods in Molecular Biology, 2nd edition, Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, Conn., USA: 611-646). The plasmid pRSV-neo (ATCC) was included as a selectable marker. Clonal cell lines were selected in RPMI 1640 media containing 0.5 mg/mL of G418 (Life Technologies, Milano, Italy), ring cloned, and expanded into culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMembranes for in vitro receptor binding assays were obtained by homogenizing the CHO-K1 cells expressing the SSTR's subtypes in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl and centrifuging twice at 39,000 g (10 min), with an intermediate resuspension in fresh buffer. The final pellets were resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl for assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the \n \n \n \nSSTR\n \n \n \n 1, 3, 4, and 5 assays, aliquots of the membrane preparations were incubated 90 minutes at 25Â° C. with 0.05 nM [\n125\nI-Tyr11]SS-14 in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 10 mg/mL BSA, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 200 KIU/mL Trasylol, 0.02 mg/mL bacitracin, and 0.02 mg/mL phenylmethylsuphonyl fluoride. The final assay volume was 0.3 mL.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the \nSSTR\n 2 assay, 0.05 nM [\n125\nI]MK-678 was employed as the radioligand and the incubation time was 90 minutes at 25Â° C. The incubations were terminated by rapid filtration through GF/C glass microfiber filters (Whatman Co.) (pre-soaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine) using a BRANDEL filtration manifold. Each tube and filter was washed three times with 5 mL aliquots of ice-cold buffer. Specific binding was defined as the total radioligand bound minus that bound in the presence of 1000 nM SS-14 for \n \n \n \nSSTR\n \n \n \n 1, 3, 4, and 5, or 1000 nM MK-678 for SSTR2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDopamine Receptor Specificity and Selectivity Assay\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecificity and selectivity for the dopamine-2 receptor of the dopamine analogues used to synthesize the somatostatin-dopamine chimers may be determined by a radioligand binding assay as follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCrude membranes were prepared by homogenization of frozen rat corpus striatum (Zivic Laboratories, Pittsburgh, Pa., USA) in 20 mL of ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl with a Brinkman Polytron cell disrupter (setting 6, 15 sec). Buffer was added to obtain a final volume of 40 mL, and the homogenate was centrifuged in a Sorval SS-34 rotor at 39,000 g for 10 minutes at 0-4Â° C. The resulting supernatant was decanted and discarded. The pellet was rehomogenized in ice-cold buffer, pre-incubated at 37Â° C. for 10 min, diluted, and centrifuged as before. The final pellet was resuspended in buffer and held on ice for the receptor binding assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor assay, aliquots of the washed membrane preparations and test compounds were incubated for 15 minutes (37Â° C.) with 0.25 nM [\n3\nHI]spiperone (16.5 Ci.mmol, New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass., USA) in 50 mM Tris HCl, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n. The final assay volume was 1.0 mL. The incubations were terminated by rapid filtration through GF/B glass fibre filters using a Brandel filtration manifold. Each tube and filter was then washed three times with 5-mL aliquots of ice-cold buffer. Specific binding was defined as the total radioligand bound minus that bound in the presence of 1000 nM (+) butaclamol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUsing the discussed assays, the inhibition constants (Ki) for the five human somatostatin receptors (hSSTR1-hSSTR5) and the dopamine-2 receptor (hUTII and hDA2) were measured for the exemplified somatostatin-dopamine conjugates, as follows:\n\n\n \n

neuro-endocrine tumors and may show functional synergism. Novel somatostatin-dopamine chimeric molecules as disclosed herein, such as Example 1, that bind to both receptor subtypes have displayed superagonistic properties in some earlier preclinical studies. This may be either due to the induction of heterodimerization of their target receptors at the plasma membrane or to enhanced activation of the individual receptors of these compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA cAMP Responsive Element-Luciferase reporter gene assay in HEK-293 cells was used in this assay, wherein said HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with D\n2 \nand/or sst\n2 \ncDNA. In D\n2\n-monotransfected cells, the IC\n50 \nvalue of cAMP inhibition of Example 1 was 0.02 nM. In sst\n2\n-monotransfected cells, the IC\n50 \nvalue of cAMP inhibition of Example 1 was 0.04 nM. In sst\n2\n-D\n2 \nco-transfected cells, the IC\n50 \nvalue of cAMP inhibition of Example 1 was 0.02 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt can be concluded that in this cell model, Example 1 mediates most of its superpotent effects through high-affinity binding and activation of D\n2 \nreceptors. The superior activation of D2 receptors in combination with a high potency activation of sst2 receptors could explain the superagonistic effects that have been observed with this compound in several preclinical studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of Solubility of Example 1 at Various Concentrations of DMA and PEG400\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound that may advantageously be used to practice the invention can be tested to determine its solubility at different DMA and PEG400 concentrations using the following procedure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolvents used are:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% DMA, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% PEG400 in water; and\n\n\n \n \n \n \n5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% DMA, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% PEG400 in PBS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo about 1 mg of Example 1 were added increasing volumes of the above solvents or buffers. When a soluble volume was reached, the concentration was calculated by weight/volume. When Example 1 was not soluble, the solution was centrifuged and the supernatant was analyzed by HPLC to determine the concentrations. The determined concentration is treated as the solubility of Example 1 in that solvent or buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solution pHs were checked. They were about pH 7. No further adjustment was done.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solubility of Example 1 in water and PBS are very different. Example 1 is much more soluble in water based solvents than in PBS based solvents. Therefore, both water and PBS based solvents were used in this study. The results are listed in the following tables.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSolubility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWater pH 7\n\n\n(mg/mL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nâ0% DMA\n\n\n0.86*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nâ5% DMA\n\n\n>100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10% DMA\n\n\n>100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n20% DMA\n\n\n>100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30% DMA\n\n\n>100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n40% DMA\n\n\n>100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nâ5% PEG400\n\n\n>50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10% PEG400\n\n\n>50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n20% PEG400\n\n\n>50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30% PEG400\n\n\n>50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n40% PEG400\n\n\n>50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*by HPLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nSolubility\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPBS pH 7\n\n\n(mg/mL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nâ0% DMA\n\n\n0.04*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nâ5% DMA\n\n\n0.13*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10% DMA\n\n\n0.48*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n20% DMA\n\n\n0.78*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30% DMA\n\n\n4.20*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n40% DMA\n\n\n>50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nâ5% PEG400\n\n\n0.05*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n10% PEG400\n\n\n0.33*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n20% PEG400\n\n\n0.75*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n30% PEG400\n\n\n2.98*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n40% PEG400\n\n\n3.50*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n*by HPLC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmacokinetic Studies of Example 1 Formulations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFive different formulations of Example 1 (âFormulations 1-5â) were prepared by using the following procedures:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(1) Example 1 was dissolved in 5% DMA water solution at the concentration of 200 mg/mL.\n \n(2) Example 1 was dissolved in 5% PEG400 water solution at the concentration of 200 mg/mL.\n \n(3) Example 1 was dissolved in 20% PEG400 water solution at the concentration of 30% (w/v).\n \n(4) Example 1 was dissolved in water at the concentration of 15% (w/v).\n \n(5) Example 1 was dissolved in water at the concentration of 30% (w/v).\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nDosing and Blood Sample Collection\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor Formulations (1) and (2), Sprague Dawley rats were dosed at 20 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously with these formulations of Example 1.

indicate that the formulations of Example 1 according to the present invention as described herein provide for acceptable sustained release formulations with reduced initial plasma concentrations, which may reduce or eliminate unwanted side-effects. The data also indicate that, after the subcutaneous injection, the body fluid is able to dilute the organic contents of Formulations (1), (2) and (3), and result in the rapid precipitation of Example 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional embodiments of the present invention will be apparent from the foregoing disclosure and are intended to be encompassed by the invention as described fully herein and defined in the following claims."
