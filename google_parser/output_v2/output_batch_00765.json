Description\n\n\n\n\n ZANAMIVIR PHOSPHONATE CONGENERS WITH ANTI-INFLUENZA ACTIVITY AND DETERMINING OSELTAMIVIR SUSCEPTIBILITY OF INFLUENZA VIRUSES\n\n\nINVENTORS: \n\n\n Chi-Huey WONG, Jim-Min FANG, Yih-Shyun E. CHENG, and Jiun-Jie SHIE \n\n\n CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\n [0001] This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. \n\n\n61/333, 137, filed May 10, 2010 and titled \"Compositions and Methods for Determining \n\n\nOseltamivir Susceptibility of Influenza Viruses,\" the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. \n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n [0002] The invention relates to novel compounds that are effective against influenza virus. The invention relates to novel phosphonate compounds that inhibit influenza virus neuraminidase from wild-type and oseltamivir-resistant strains of H1N1, H5N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. The invention relates to detection of drug resistant pathogens. In particular, the invention relates to the detection of ostelamivir-resistant influenza viruses. More particularly, the invention relates to the detection of ostelamivir-resistant influenza viruses using novel compounds disclosed in the present invention. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n [0003] Outbreaks of influenza A virus continue to cause widespread morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States alone, an estimated 5 to 20% of the population is infected by influenza A virus annually, causing approximately 200,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths. The establishment of comprehensive vaccination policies has been an effective measure to limit influenza morbidity. However, the frequent genetic drifting of the virus requires yearly reformulation of the vaccine, potentially leading to a mismatch between the viral strain present in the vaccine and that circulating. \n\n\n [0004] Influenza A virus consists of 9 structural proteins and codes additionally for two nonstructural NS 1 proteins with regulatory functions. The segmented nature of the viral genome allows the mechanism of genetic reassortment (exchange of genome segments) to take place during mixed infection of a cell with different viral strains. The influenza A virus is classified into various subtypes depending on the different hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase ( A) viral proteins displayed on their surface. Influenza A virus subtypes are identified by two viral surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA or H) and neuraminidase (NA or N). Each influenza \n\n virus subtype is identified by its combination of H and N proteins. There are 16 known HA subtypes and 9 known NA subtypes. \n\n\n [0005] Influenza virus is a negative-sense segmented RNA virus that can infect many animal species including human. The replication of influenza genome by the viral coded RNA dependent RNA polymerase is an error prone process generating progenies with varied genetic sequences at all times. Viable viruses with genetic alterations are designated \"antigenic drift\" mutants. The segmented nature of the viral genome and the possibility to infect different animal species could produce \"antigenic shift\" mutants (P. K. Cheng et al, Emerg. Infect. Dis. 15, 966 (2009)). Under desirable conditions, dominant variants may become prominent pathogens for human or animals. The multi-step selection processes leading to mutant evolution are not completely understood (L. Cohen-Daniel et al, J. Clin. Virol. 44, 138 (2009); R. Wagner, M. Matrosovich, H. D. Klenk, Rev. Med. Virol. 12, 159 (2002)). Whereas vaccines are often used for the prevention of influenza virus infections, the most useful therapies for the treatment of influenza infections involve administration of Tamiflu® (the phosphate salt of oseltamivir ethyl ester, Roche \n\n\nLaboratories, Inc.) and Relenza® (zanamivir, Glaxo Wellcome, Inc.). (N. J. Cox, J. M. Hughes, N. Engl. J. Med. 341, 1387 (1999)). Oseltamivir and zanamivir are viral sialidase (neuraminidase) inhibitors that prevent the release and dispersal of progeny virions within the mucosal secretions and thereby reduce viral infectivity. Neuraminidase (NA), a glycoprotein expressed on the influenza virus surface, is essential for virus replication and infectivity by breaking the linkage between the progeny virus from the surface sialo-receptor of host cells. Thus, inhibition of NA by the structure-based strategy has been applied in discovery of anti-influenza drugs. \n\n\n[0006] Zanamivir (Relenza™) (von Itzstein, M. et al. Nature 1993, 363, 418. Dunn, C.J.; Goa, K.L. Drugs 1999, 58, 761.) is a popular drug for the treatment of influenza. Tamiflu is a prodrug that is readily hydrolyzed by hepatic esterases to give the corresponding oseltamivir carboxylic acid as the active inhibitor to interact with three arginine residues (Argl 18, Arg292 and Arg371) in the active site of viral neuraminidase (NA). (von Itzstein, M. et al. Nature 1993, 363, 418. Lew, W. et al. Curr. Med. Chem. 2000, 7, 663. Russell, R. J. et al. Nature 2006, 443, 45.) Both oseltamivir and zanamivir inhibit influenza virus NA that is essential for virus propagation by cleaving the linkage between the progeny virus from the surface sialo-receptor of host cells. The NA inhibitors are designed to have (oxa)cyclohexene scaffolds to mimic the oxonium transition- state in the enzymatic cleavage of sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid), the outmost saccharide on the cell surface glycoprotein for binding with the active site of viral ΝΑ. To accommodate the binding with oseltamivir carboxylic acid, an induced fit of the ΝΑ to create a large hydrophobic pocket is needed for the 3-pentyl side chain. (Collins, P. J., et al. Nature 2008, 453, 1258.) In comparison, zanamivir is less susceptible to the newly evolved resistant viruses than oseltamivir \n\n phosphate. In the absence of the need for generating the hydrophobic binding pocket, the inhibition potency of zanamivir to the NA mutant (e.g. the clinically relevant H274Y mutant) is unchanged. \n\n\n [0007] Influenza A(H1N1) viruses bear a oseltamivir resistance conferring amino acid change of histidine to tyrosine at position 274 (H274Y) of the neuraminidase (NA) protein. The 2008 surge of the oseltamivir resistant H274Y mutants in seasonal HlNl (A. Moscona, N. Engl. J. Med. 360, 953 (2009)) was puzzling because the increases of these mutations are not correlated to oseltamivir usage in many of the H274Y prevalent areas (J. Mossong et al. , Antiviral Res. 84, 91 (2009); M. Jonges et al, Antiviral Res. 83, 290 (2009)). In addition, the H274Y oseltamivir resistant pandemic HlNl (A. Gulland, Br. Med. J. 339, b4975 (2009)) and the Η5Ν1 mutants (Q. M. Le et al, Nature 437, 1108 (2005)) are reported in patients suggesting that these mutants could impact influenza therapy options (I. Stephenson et al, Clin. Infect. Dis. 48, 389 (2009)). \n\n\n[0008] Many derivatives of zanamivir have been prepared by modification at the glyceryl moiety scaffolds to mimic the oxonium transition-state in the enzymatic cleavage of sialic acid. The phosphonate group is generally used as a bioisostere of carboxylate in drug design. (White, C. L. et al. J. Mol. Biol. 1995, 245, 623. Schug, K. A.; Lindner, W. Chem. Rev. 2005, 105, 67. \n\n\nStreicher, H.; Busseb, H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006, 14, 1047.) In comparison with the carboxylate-guanidinium ion-pair, a phosphonate ion will exhibit stronger electrostatic interactions with the guanidinium ion. Thus, the zanamivir phosphonate congener is expected to have more potent against the neuraminidases of HlNl and Η5Ν1 viruses, even the H274Y mutant. The enhanced affinity may be attributable to the strong electrostatic interactions of the phosphonate group with the three arginine residues (Argl 18, Arg292 and Arg371) in \n\n\nphysiological conditions. \n\n\n [0009] Solution-phase neuraminidase inhibition assays normally use the fluorogenic substrate, 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-. alpha. -D-acetyl-neuraminic acid, which is cleaved by neuraminidase to yield a fluorescent product that can be quantified using a fluorometer (Potier et al, Anal. Biochem. 94:287-296 (1979)), however, this assay method is not amenable to a high-throughput format. In addition, due to the fast emergence of resistant viral strains (see McKimm-Breschkin, J. L. Antiviral Res. 2000, 47, 1-17), there remains a need to find new influenza neuraminidase inhibitors. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n [0010] The worldwide surge of oseltamivir resistant HlNl influenza viruses in 2008 has prompted the survey for resistant mutants and the need for development of quick tests for oseltamivir susceptibility. In the midst of the potentially prevalent oseltamivir resistant HlNl \n\n viruses, there is a need for a \"point-of-care\" test for quick assessment of the oseltamivir susceptibility of a patient's specimens in a doctor's office that will benefit decisions regarding treatment options. \n\n\n [0011] Novel phosphonate compounds are described.

(7 A) Structures of compounds used in this study. (7B) OC susceptible (S) or OC resistant (R) WSN virus samples were immobilized in anti-HA coated microplate wells at 10\n5\n, 10\n4\n, or 10\n3\n PFU per well. The immobilized viral samples in triplicate wells were incubated with 30 nM ZB for total binding or with 30 nM ZB plus competing OC at 150 nM to measure OC resistant ZB binding. The bound viruses were further incubated with streptavidin conjugated alkaline phosphatase followed by the chemiluminescent substrate to measure the relative luminescence units (RLU) increases due to the catalysis by the bound alkaline phosphatase. The values of OC resistant ZB binding were calculated as the ratios of RLU measured in the presence of OC competition and those measured in the absence of OC. Conditions resulting in significant binding reductions by competing OC are labeled with for p < 0.001.

(9 A) A PVDF membrane with immobilized anti-HA antibody slots was used to absorb influenza samples that were pre-incubated with either 30 nM ZB or 30 nM ZB plus 150 nM OC. In this study, the wild type WSN (274H) or the OC resistant WSN (274Y) mutant viruses at 10\n4\n, 10\n5\n, 10\n6\n PFU per slot were used.

In the case of conflict, the present document, including definitions will control. \n\n\n [0058] Oseltamivir is an oral prodrug that is converted by endogenous esterases to oseltamivir carboxylate (OC). Zanamivir works by binding to the active site of the neuraminidase protein, rendering the influenza virus unable to escape its host cell and infect others. (Cyranoski D \n\n\n(September 2005) Nat. Medicine 11 (9): 909). It is also an inhibitor of influenza virus replication \n\n in vitro and in vivo. Bioavailability of zanamivir is 2% and it is usually administered by inhalation. \n\n\n [0059] Recent reports on the drug resistant avian flu infections and the side effects in children receiving Tamiflu® treatments suggest that new chemical identities for neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are needed for the battle against the threat of the pandemic flu. The NA inhibitors are designed to have (oxa)cyclohexene scaffolds to mimic the oxonium transition-state in the enzymatic cleavage of sialic acid, (Russell et al, Nature 2006,443 :45). On hydrolysis by hepatic esterases, the active carboxylate, oseltamivir is exposed to interact with three arginine residues (Argl 18, Arg292 and Arg371) in the active site of NA. (Id.). \n\n\n Synthesis of zanamivir phosphonate congeners with anti-influenza activity \n\n\n [0060] The present disclosure provides a novel synthetic route to novel phosphonate congers of zanamivir. D-Sialic acid was utilized as a chiral precursor for the synthesis of novel active neuraminidase inhibitors. Novel phosphonate congers exhibit better anti-flu activities than zanamivir and oseltamivir by inhibiting the neuraminidases of the wild-type and H274Y mutant of HINI and H5N1 viruses. \n\n\n [0061] In one implementation, the invention provides a novel synthetic method to \n\n\nenantioselective synthesis of various zanamivir phosphonate congeners and the derivatives with reasonably high yields. The synthetic route is shown in Figure 1. Reagents and steps described in Figure 1 are as follows: \n\n\n [0062] Step 1. Sialic acid (2) was treated with acetic anhydride in pyridine to afford the peracetylation intermediate, which was heated at 100 °C to induce decarboxylation, giving compound 3. (Horn, E. J., et al Carbohydr. Res. 2008, 343, 936). \n\n\n [0063] Step 2. Compound 3 was treated with trimethylsilyl diethyl phosphate as the appropriate nucleophile to afford the phosphonate compound 4 as a mixture of a and β anomers (2:3), which could be separated by chromatography and characterized by NMR spectral analyses. \n\n\n[0064] Step 3. Phosphonates 4 (as an anomeric mixture) was irradiated with N- bromosuccinimide (NBS) in CH2CI2 solution to undergo a radical type bromination, which was treated in situ with pyridine to afford a β-elimination product 5, a phosphonate derivative of Neu5Ac2en (DANA). This synthetic method for 5 was much more efficient than a lengthy procedure reported previously for its analogue of dimethyl phosphonate (Vasella, A.; Wyler, R. Helv. Chim. Acta 1991, 74, 451). \n\n\n [0065] Step 4. In a media of acetic anhydride, acetic acid and concentrated H2SO4, compound 5 was converted into the oxazoline 6. \n\n [0066] Step 5. The regio- and stereoselective ring-opening reaction of oxazoline 6 with azidotrimethylsilane was carried out to afford an azido compound 7 as the pivotal intermediate leading to compounds la, lb, lc and Id. \n\n\n [0067] Step 6. Compound 7 was converted to phosphonic acid la by a sequence of three reactions: removal of both ethyl groups from phosphonate 7 with bromotrimethylsilane, deacetylation using sodium methoxide in methanol, and selective reduction of the azido group to amine by hydrogenation in the presence of Lindlar catalyst. \n\n\n [0068] Alternatively, only one ethyl group was removed from phosphonate diester 7 on treatment with sodium ethoxide in ethanol, giving phosphonate diester lc after the subsequent reduction of the azido group. \n\n\n [0069] Step 7. To introduce a guanidino substituent, the azido group in compound 7 was first reduced to give amine, which reacted with l,3-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-2-methylthiopseudourea in the presence of mercury chloride and triethylamine to afford guanidine compound 8. \n\n\n[0070] Step 8. Both ethyl groups in phosphonate 8 were removed by bromotrimethylsilane, and the concurrent removal of tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) groups was realized by workup with methanol due to the in situ generated HBr. The zanamivir phosphonate (lb) was obtained by deacetylation. \n\n\n [0071] Alternatively, phosphonate diester 7 was converted to a monoester with sodium ethoxide, followed by removal of Boc groups with trifluoroacetic acid, to give compound Id. \n\n\n[0072] The compositions of this invention optionally comprise salts of the compounds herein, especially pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic salts containing, for example, Na\n+\n, Li\n+\n, K\n+\n, Ca\n++\n and Mg\n++\n. Such salts may include those derived by combination of appropriate cations such as alkali and alkaline earth metal ions or ammonium and quaternary amino ions with an acid anion moiety. \n\n\n [0073] Metal salts are prepared by reacting the metal hydroxide with a compound of this invention. Examples of metal salts which are prepared in this way are salts containing Na\n+\n, Li\n+\n, K\n+\n. \n\n\n [0074] In addition, salts may be formed from acid addition of certain organic and inorganic acids, e.g., HC1, HBr, H\n2\nS0\n4\n, or organic sulfonic acids, to basic centers, typically amines. \n\n\nFinally, it is to be understood that the compositions herein comprise compounds of the invention in their un-ionized, as well as zwitterionic form, and combinations with stoichiometric amounts of water as in hydrates. Another aspect of the invention relates to methods of inhibiting the activity of neuraminidase comprising the step of treating a sample suspected of containing neuraminidase with a compound of the invention. \n\n [0075] The compounds of this invention are formulated with conventional carriers and excipients, which will be selected in accord with ordinary practice. Tablets will contain excipients, glidants, fillers, binders and the like. Aqueous formulations are prepared in sterile form, and when intended for delivery by other than oral administration generally will be isotonic. All formulations will optionally contain excipients such as those set forth in the \"Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients\" (1986), which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety. Excipients include ascorbic acid and other antioxidants, chelating agents such as EDTA, carbohydrates such as dextrin, hydroxyalkylcellulose, hydroxyalkylmethylcellulose, stearic acid and the like. The pH of the formulations ranges from about pH 3 to about pH 1 1, but is ordinarily about pH 7 to pH 10. \n\n\n [0076] One or more compounds of the invention (herein referred to as the active ingredients) are administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. Suitable routes include oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), and the like. It will be appreciated that the preferred route may vary with for example the condition of the recipient. \n\n\n [0077] While it is possible for the active ingredients to be administered alone it may be preferable to present them as pharmaceutical formulations. The formulations, both for veterinary and for human use, of the invention comprise at least one active ingredient, as above defined, together with one or more acceptable carriers therefore and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be \"acceptable\" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and physiologically innocuous to the recipient thereof. \n\n\n[0078] The formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration routes. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and. intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. \n\n\n[0079] Formulations of the invention suitable for oral administration are prepared as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a nonaqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste. \n\n [0080] A tablet is made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered active ingredient moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and optionally are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient. \n\n\n[0081] For infections of the eye or other external tissues e.g. mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as a topical ointment or cream containing the active ingredient(s) in an amount of, for example, 0.075 to 20% w/w (including active ingredient(s) in a range between 0.1% and 20% in increments of 0.1% w/w such as 0.6% w/w, 0.7% w/w, etc.), preferably 0.2 to 15% w/w and most preferably 0.5 to 10% w/w. When formulated in an ointment, the active ingredients may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. \n\n\nAlternatively, the active ingredients may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base. \n\n\n [0082] If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may include, for example, at least 30% w/w of a polyhydric alcohol, i.e. an alcohol having two or more hydroxyl groups such as propylene glycol, butane 1,3-diol, mannitol, sorbitol, glycerol and polyethylene glycol (including PEG 400) and mixtures thereof. The topical formulations may desirably include a compound which enhances absorption or penetration of the active ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethyl sulphoxide and related analogs. \n\n\n [0083] The oily phase of the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier (otherwise known as an emulgent), it desirably comprises a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. \n\n\n [0084] Emulgents and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the invention include Tween™ 60, Span™ 80, cetostearyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl mono-stearate and sodium lauryl sulfate. \n\n\n [0085] The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formulation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties. The cream should preferably be a non-greasy, non-staining and washable \n\n product with suitable consistency to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or branched chain, mono- or dibasic alkyl esters such as di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, isopropyl palmitate, butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a blend of branched chain esters known as Crodamol CAP may be used, the last three being preferred esters. These may be used alone or in combination depending on the properties required. Alternatively, high melting point lipids such as white soft paraffin and/or liquid paraffin or other mineral oils are used. \n\n\n [0086] Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. The active ingredient is preferably present in such formulations in a concentration of 0.5 to 20%, advantageously 0.5 to 10% particularly about 1.5% w/w. \n\n\n [0087] Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier. \n\n\n [0088] Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a suitable base comprising for example cocoa butter or a salicylate. \n\n\n [0089] Formulations suitable for intrapulmonary or nasal administration have a particle size for example in the range of 0.1 to 500 microns (including particle sizes in a range between 0.1 and 500 microns in increments microns such as 0.5, 1, 30 microns, 35 microns, etc.), which is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage or by inhalation through the mouth so as to reach the alveolar sacs. Suitable formulations include aqueous or oily solutions of the active ingredient. Formulations suitable for aerosol or dry powder administration may be prepared according to conventional methods and may be delivered with other therapeutic agents such as compounds heretofore used in the treatment or prophylaxis of influenza A or B infections. \n\n\n[0090] Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. \n\n\n [0091] Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. \n\n\n[0092] The formulations are presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injection, immediately prior to use. \n\n Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions are prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient. \n\n\n [0093] It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above the formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents. \n\n\n [0094] The invention further provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier therefor. Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered orally, parenterally or by any other desired route. Compounds of the invention are used to provide controlled release pharmaceutical formulations containing as active ingredient one or more compounds of the invention (\"controlled release formulations\") in which the release of the active ingredient are controlled and regulated to allow less frequency dosing or to improve the pharmacokinetic or toxicity profile of a given active ingredient. Effective dose of active ingredient depends at least on the nature of the condition being treated, toxicity, whether the compound is being used prophylactic ally (lower doses) or against an active influenza infection, the method of delivery, and the pharmaceutical formulation, and will be determined by the clinician using conventional dose escalation studies. It can be expected to be from about 0.0001 to about 100 mg/kg body weight per day. Typically, from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg body weight per day. More typically, from about 0.01 to about 5 mg/kg body weight per day. More typically, from about 0.05 to about 0.5 mg/kg body weight per day. For example, for inhalation the daily candidate dose for an adult human of approximately 70 kg body weight will range from 1 mg to 1000 mg, preferably between 5 mg and 500 mg, and may take the form of single or multiple doses. \n\n\n [0095] In one implementation, active ingredients of the invention are also used in combination with other active ingredients. Such combinations are selected based on the condition to be treated, cross-reactivities of ingredients and pharmaco-properties of the combination. For example, when treating viral infections of the respiratory system, in particular influenza infection, the compositions of the invention are combined with antivirals (such as amantidine, rimantadine and ribavirin), mucolytics, expectorants, bronchialdilators, antibiotics, antipyretics, \n\n or analgesics. Ordinarily, antibiotics, antipyretics, and analgesics are administered together with the compounds of this invention. \n\n\n [0096] Another implementation of the invention includes in vivo metabolic products of the compounds described herein, to the extent such products are novel and unobvious over the prior art. Such products may result for example from the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification and the like of the administered compound, primarily due to enzymatic processes. Accordingly, the invention includes novel and unobvious compounds produced by a process comprising contacting a compound of this invention with a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof. Such products typically are identified by preparing a radiolabeled (e.g. \n14\nC or \n3\nH) compound of the invention, administering it parenterally in a detectable dose (e.g. greater than about 0.5 mg/kg) to an animal such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or to man, allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur (typically about 30 seconds to 30 hours) and isolating its conversion products from the urine, blood or other biological samples. These products are easily isolated since they are labeled (others are isolated by the use of antibodies capable of binding epitopes surviving in the metabolite). The metabolite structures are determined in conventional fashion, e.g. by MS or NMR analysis. In general, analysis of metabolites is done in the same way as conventional drug metabolism studies well- known to those skilled in the art. The conversion products, so long as they are not otherwise found in vivo, are useful in diagnostic assays for therapeutic dosing of the compounds of the invention even if they possess no neuraminidase inhibitory activity of their own. \n\n\n[0097] Prodrugs of the novel phosphonate congeners are contemplated. Both the polar phosphonate and guanidinium groups may be optionally further functionalized by techniques known in the art to enhance pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic properties. For example, formulation and use of prodrugs, e.g. acyloxymethyl- and aryl phosphonate esters, may be utilized to enhance oral bioavailability (Krise and Stella, Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1996, 19, 287). \n\n\n[0098] In one aspect of the invention, samples suspected of containing neuraminidase include natural or man-made materials such as living organisms; tissue or cell cultures; biological samples such as biological material samples (blood, serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, tears, sputum, saliva, tissue samples, and the like); laboratory samples; food, water, or air samples; bioproduct samples such as extracts of cells, particularly recombinant cells synthesizing a desired glycoprotein; and the like. Typically the sample will be suspected of containing an organism which produces neuraminidase, frequently a pathogenic organism such as a virus. Samples can be contained in any medium including water and organic solvent/water mixtures. Samples include living organisms such as humans, and man-made materials such as cell cultures. \n\n [0099] The treating step of the invention comprises adding the composition of the invention to the sample or it comprises adding a precursor of the composition to the sample. The addition step comprises any method of administration as described above. If desired, the activity of neuraminidase after application of the composition can be observed by any method including direct and indirect methods of detecting neuraminidase activity. Quantitative, qualitative, and semiquantitative methods of determining neuraminidase activity are all contemplated. Typically one of the screening methods described above are applied, however, any other method such as observation of the physiological properties of a living organism are also applicable. \n\n\n[0100] Organisms that contain neuraminidase include bacteria (Vibrio cholerae, Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Arthrobacter sialophilus) and viruses (especially orthomyxoviruses or paramyxoviruses such as influenza virus A (e.g. H1N1, H5N1), and B, parainfluenza virus, mumps virus, Newcastle disease virus, fowl plague virus, and sendai virus). Inhibition of neuraminidase activity obtained from or found within any of these organisms is within the objects of this invention. The virology of influenza viruses is described in \n\n\n\"Fundamental Virology\" (Raven Press, New York, 1986), Chapter 24. The compounds of this invention are useful in the prophylaxis of influenza infections or treatment of existing influenza infections in animals such as ducks and other birds, rodents, swine, or in humans. \n\n\n[0101] Compositions of the invention are screened for inhibitory activity against \n\n\nneuraminidase by any of the conventional techniques for evaluating enzyme activity. Within the context of the invention, typically compositions are first screened for inhibition of neuraminidase in vitro and compositions showing inhibitory activity are then screened for activity in vivo. \n\n\nCompositions having in vitro ¾ (inhibitory constants) of less than about 5 x 10 \n6\n M, typically less than about 1 x 10 \n7\n M and preferably less than about 5 x 10 \n8\n M are preferred for in vivo use. \n\n\n [0102] Useful in vitro screens have been described in detail and will not be elaborated here. (Itzstein, M. von et al.; \"Nature\", 363(6428):418-423 (1993); Potier, M.; et al; \"Analyt. \n\n\nBiochem.\", 94:287-296 (1979); Chong, A. K. J.; et al; \"Biochem. Biophys. Acta\", 1077:65-71 (1991); and Colman, P. M.; et al; International Publication No. WO 92/06691 (Int. App. No. PCT/AU90/00501, publication date Apr. 30, 1992)). In vivo screens have also been described in detail (Itzstein, et al, 1993 in particular page 421, column 2, first full paragraph, to page 423, column 2, first partial paragraph, and Colman, p. 36). \n\n\n [0103] Table 1 shows neuraminidase inhibition, anti-influenza, and cytotoxicity activities of zanamivir phosphonate derivatives la and lb in comparison with zanamivir and oseltamivir acid. The phosphonate derivatives la and lb showed greater potencies than zanamivir against various wild-type and mutant influenza viruses. \n\n Table 1.

Human 293T cells were used for cytotoxicity measurements for compounds. \n\n\nb A fluorescent substrate, 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-a-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) was used to determine the IC\n50\n values that are compound concentrations causing 50% inhibition of different influenza neuraminidase enzymes. \n\n\nc Inhibition constants were determined by kinetic studies using MUNANA as the substrate. \nd\n The anti-influenza activities against different influenza strains were measured as EC5\n0\n values that are the compound concentrations for 50% protection of the cytopathic effects due to the infection by different influenza strains. \n\n\ne The highest concentration used without noticeable toxic effects in the assay of cytotoxicity on 293T cells. \n\n\n [0104] The neuraminidase inhibitory assays were measured against the neuraminidase of several influenza strains using the influenza associated neuraminidase as the enzyme sources. A fluorescence substrate MUNANA (2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-a-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid) was used to measure the neuraminidase activities for all viral enzymes. Table 1 shows the IC\n50\n values that measure the compound concentrations for 50% inhibition of neuraminidase activities and assess the relative neuraminidase inhibitory potencies of these compounds. \n\n\n[0105] The IC50 values for both la and lb against all five neuraminidases are all noticeably more potent than zanamivir and similar to those for oseltamivir acid. These two phosphonate compounds are significantly more active in inhibiting the oseltamivir-resistant neuraminidase \n\n mutant of WSN 274Y that has a tyrosine residue replacing the parental histidine at the 274 position of the neuraminidase. \n\n\n [0106] The anti-influenza activities of these compounds were measured against five influenza strains for abilities to protect the influenza infection mediated cytopathic effects. The anti- influenza activities were determined as EC5\n0\n values that are the concentrations for 50% protection of the infection mediated cytopathic effects. Table 1 shows that la and lb have greater anti-influenza activities against the Hl l influenza viruses, such as the WSN and the 2009 pandemic Hl l strains. \n\n\n [0107] The anti-influenza activities of la and lb are particularly noticeable against the oseltamivir-resistant WSN (HlNl) virus. HlNl influenza viruses carrying the oseltamivir- resistant neuraminidase mutation at the 274 position have been the prevailing HlNl isolates in clinic (Moscona, A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005, 353, 2633). The superior anti-influenza activities of la and lb for this mutant neuraminidase may impact the option for treating this prevailing influenza strain. In addition to being potent anti-influenza inhibitors against the HlNl influenza strains, la and lb are also comparable to zanamivir as anti-influenza agents against the RG14 (Η5Ν1) and the Udorn (Η3Ν2) influenza strains. \n\n\n [0108] Bioassay measurements showed that both la and lb are potent anti-neuraminidase and anti-influenza compounds. They are generally more potent than zanamivir and are very active against the oseltamivir-resistant HlNl influenza viruses. In addition to be potent anti-influenza agents, they are nontoxic to the human 293T cells at the highest testing concentrations (Table 1). \n\n\n[0109] In one implementation of the present disclosure, phosphonate la is a potent ΝΑ inhibitor and anti-flu agent against A/WSN/1933 (HlNl) virus with IC5\n0\n and EC5\n0\n values of 0.65 and 1.3 nM, respectively. \n\n\n [0110] In one implementation of the present disclosure, phosphonate la is a potent NA inhibitor and anti-flu agent against the H274Y mutant of A/WSN/1933 (HlNl) virus with IC\n50\n and EC5\n0\n values of 0.5 and 27 nM, respectively. These IC5\n0\n and EC5\n0\n values of the zanamivir phosphonate are particularly impressive for Tamiflu-resistant HlNl virus. \n\n\n [0111] In one implementation of the present disclosure, phosphonate la is also a potent NA inhibitor and anti-flu agent against A/California/7/2009 (pandemic HlNl), \n\n\n A/Vietnam/ 1194/2004 RG14 (H5N1), and A/Udorn/307/1972 (H3N2) viruses. \n\n\n [0112] In one implementation of the present disclosure, phosphonate lb is a potent NA inhibitor and anti-flu agent against A/WSN/1933 (HlNl) virus with IC\n50\n and EC5\n0\n values of 1.2 and 2.4 nM, respectively. \n\n\n [0113] In one implementation of the present disclosure, phosphonate lb is a potent NA inhibitor and anti-flu agent against the H274Y mutant of A/WSN/1933 (HlNl) virus with IC\n50\n \n\n and EC5\n0\n values of 0.25 and 26 nM, respectively. The high potency of lb against Tamiflu- resistant H1 1 virus is very significant. \n\n\n [0114] In one implementation of the present disclosure, phosphonate lb is also a potent NA inhibitor and anti-flu agent against A/California/7/2009 (pandemic H1N1), \n\n\nA/Vietnam/ 1 194/2004 RG14 (H5N1), and A/Udorn/307/1972 (H3N2) viruses. \n\n\n[0115] In one aspect of the invention, molecular modeling of the neuraminidase-phosphonate complex indicates a pertinent binding mode of the phosphonate with three arginine residues in the active site. The molecular docking experiments (Figure 2) using the known Nl crystal structure (PDB code: 2HU4) reveal that the phosphonate inhibitor lb binds strongly with the tri- arginine residues of NA, in addition to other interactions exerted by the C7-C9 glyceryl, C\n4\n- acetamido and Cs-guanidino groups in the binding pocket similar to the neuraminidase- zanamivir complex. \n\n\n [0116] In one aspect of the invention, molecular modeling of phosphonate inhibitor la showed the strong interactions with the three arginine residues of neuraminidase, in addition to other interactions exerted by the C7-C9 glyceryl, C\n4\n-acetamido and Cs-amino groups in the binding pocket (Figure 2). \n\n\n Identification of Tamiflu-resistant viral isolates \n\n\n [0117] The specification herein discloses the design and practice of the method of Resistance Assessment by Binding Competition (RABC) for development of effective diagnostics for Tamiflu-resistant viral isolates. \n\n\n [0118] Zanamivir and OC bind to the same active site of influenza neuraminidase (NA). \n\n\nHowever, oseltamivir-resistance H5N1 virus neuraminidase can still retain susceptibility to zanamivir. (Collins PJ, et al. (2008). Nature 453 (7199): 1258- 1261). An induced fit of the neuraminidase that involves the reorientation of the Glu276 residue toward Arg224 creating a larger hydrophobic pocket is needed to accommodate the side chain of OC (M. Z. Wang, C. Y. Tai, D. B. Mendel, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.46, 3809 (2002); P. J. Collins et al , Nature 453, 1258 (2008)). The Nl group neuraminidases can evolve to resistant forms with mutations such as H274Y that prevent the formation of the hydrophobic pocket resulting in several hundred fold increase in the oseltamivir K values. In the absence of the need of a hydrophobic pocket, the zanamivir K{ for the H274Y neuraminidase is unchanged (P. J. Collins et al , Nature 453, 1258 (2008)). In a feature of the invention, the binding difference was explored to develop a novel diagnosis for OC susceptibility of viral isolates. \n\n\n [0119] Selection of a recognition unit (R) that binds to the oseltamivir-binding region of influenza virus neuraminidase and using the differential binding between oseltamivir-sensitive \n\n and oseltamivir-resistant versions of influenza virus has been surprisingly found to be a basis for detecting Tamiflu-resistant strains of influenza virus. \n\n\n [0120] In certain aspects of the invention the recognition unit (R) is coupled to a sensor unit (S). In some embodiments, the recognition unit (R) is coupled to a linker (L) which is in turn coupled to a sensing unit (S). The R-L-S molecule is used to distinguish Tamiflu-resistant from Tamiflu-sensitive influenza viruses. \n\n\n [0121] Being a potent neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC; Tamiflu®) is an effective competitor for non-OC molecules (R) that bind to NA molecules in influenza viruses. However, OC is a poor competitor for the binding of the OC-resistant mutants (e.g., H274Y) that still binds non-OC recognition units (R) equally as well as wild type NA. \n\n\n[0122] The recognition unit (R) is typically selected from a known NA binding moiety such a zanamivir, tamiphosphor guanidine monoester, or zanamivir phosphonate la or its derivatives lb, lc and Id. In some embodiments, R is selected from oseltamivir-containing phosphonate compounds that have activity as neuraminidase inhibitors against wild-type and H274Y mutant of H1N1 and H5N1 viruses as disclosed in US patent 7,888,337B2. \n\n\n [0123] Binding to NA is detected by the signal from the sensing moiety (i.e. detectable moiety) can be observed. Such homogenous fluorescent and calorimetric sensing moieties are known to those skilled in the art. See, for example: Wang Q. M. et al, \"A continuous calorimetric assay for rhinovirus-14 3C protease using peptide p-nitroanilides as substrates\" Anal. Biochem. Vol. 252, pp. 238-45 (1997), and Basak S. et al. \"In vitro elucidation of substrate specificity and bioassay of proprotein convertase 4 using intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic peptides\" Biochem. J. Vol. 380, pp. 505-14 (2004). \n\n\n [0124] The sensor unit is linked directly or indirectly (via avidin/streptavidin-biotin, antibody- antigen, or other methods known in the art) to a detectable moiety selected from the group consisting of a fluorescent label, a gold label and an enzyme label. The various kinds of sensors are not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof include radioactive labels, quantum dot labels, protein labels, and the like \n\n\n[0125] In some aspects the sensing unit forms a detectable binding complex with a conjugated binding partner, forming a binding pair, wherein said binding partner is conjugated to a reagent. The binding pair may be based on any of: the binding pair is any one selected from the group consisting of streptavidin:biotin; avidin:biotin; folic acid:folate binding protein; sialic acid, carbohydrates, or glycoproteins: lectins; oligo- or poly-dA:oligo- or poly-dT; oligo- or poly- dC:oligo- or poly-dG; phenylboronic acid:salicylhydroxamic acid; aldehyde and ketone moieties:hydrazides; sulfhydryl moiety:maleimides; amino moieties :N-hydroxysuccinimide esters; and heavy metals :thiols; the Fc portion of IgG: Protein A/Protein G/Protein A/G; \n\n digoxigenin:anti-digoxigenin; 5-bromodeoxyuridine:anti-bromodeoxyuridine; dinitrophenyhanti- dinitrophenyl; fluorescein isothiocyanate:anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate; N-2- acetylaminofluorene:anti-N-2-acetylaminofluorene; and -2-acetylamino-7-iodofluorene:anti-N- 2-acetylamino-7-iodofluorene. \n\n\n [0126] In certain aspects the label comprises a fluorphore. In some aspects, the fluorophore is selected from the group consisting of fluorescein, rhodamine, coumarin, resorufin, xanthene, cyanine, pyrene, phthalocyanine, phycobiliprotein, Alexa, Cy3, Cy5, squarene dye, combinations resulting in energy transfer dyes, and derivatives thereof. The Alexa fluorescent dye may be selected from the group consisting of Alexa Fluor 647, Alexa Fluor 546 and Alexa Fluor 532. In some embodiments the fluorophore is selected from the group consisting of: BODIPY maleimides, iodoacetamides and methyl bromides; Alexa Fluor maleimides; fluorescein 5- and 6- isomer maleimides and methyl bromides; Oregon Green isothiocyanates and maleimides; \n\n\ntetramethylrhodamine 5- and 6-isomer iodoacetamides and maleimides; Rhodamine Red maleimides; Texas Red bromoacetamides and maleimides; pyridyloxazole maleimides; \n\n\nbenzoxadiazole derivatives including NBD halides and iodoacetamides, SBD; Lucifer Yellow iodoacetamide; stilbene iodoacetamides and maleimides; coumarin maleimides and \n\n\niodoacetamides, i.e. MDCC, IDCC, and others; naphthalene derivatives, i.e. acrylodan, badan, IAANS, MIANS, IAEDANS, and Dansyl; aziridine; dapoxyl derivatives, i.e. dapoxyl (2- bromoacetamidly)sulfonamide; pyrene maleimides and iodoacetyl derivatives; and monobromo- and monochlorobimanes. \n\n\n [0127] The method or means for detecting the signal from the sensor unit (S) is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. For example, when the signal is emission, quenching, etc., it is detected by a photodetector, camera, etc. \n\n\n[0128] The combination of the light-emitting portion and the quenching portion is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. For example, those known as the technique of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), etc. can be suitably adopted. \n\n\n [0129] The light-emitting portion is not particularly limited as long as it can generate emission, and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof include those containing a fluorescent substance, chemiluminescent substance, electrochemiluminescent substance, etc. or those formed of these substances. These may be used alone or two or more may be used in combination. Among these, in the case where the quenching portion is present adjacent to the light-emitting portion, those of which emission is quenched by the action of the quenching portion are preferable, the fluorescent substance is more preferable in that visibility thereof is excellent and detection is easy. The fluorescent substance is not particularly limited \n\n and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof include anthracene, fluorescein, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), rhodamines such as tetramethyl rhodamine and sulforhodamine, dansyl chloride, Texas Red, AL 350, indocarbocyanine (CY), and the like. \n\n\n[0130] The quenching portion is not particularly limited if it can quench the emission of the light-emitting portion when the quenching portion is located adjacent to the light-emitting portion, and the quenching portion can be appropriately selected according to the type, etc. of the light-emitting portion. Examples thereof include those containing a quenching substance, or those formed of the quenching substance. The quenching substance is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected according to the purpose. When the light-emitting portion is formed of the fluorescent substance, examples of the quenching substance include substances capable of absorbing the energy released when the fluorescent substance emits light, and the like. Suitable examples include substances allowing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the light-emitting substance. Specific examples include tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC), dimethylaminobenzenesulfonyl (DABSYL), gold nanoparticles, Black Hole Quencher, and the like. \n\n\n [0131] The recognition unit is conjugated to a sensor which is in turn coupled to a light- emitting portion and a quenching portion. The quenching portion can quench emission of the light-emitting portion before the recognition unit binds to the target NA, i.e., when the quenching portion is present adjacent to the light-emitting portion. After the recognition unit has bound to the target NA, the quenching portion dissociates from the target nucleic acid. As a result, the quenching portion exists away from the light-emitting portion, resulting in the loss of the action of the quenching portion and allowing the light-emitting portion to generate emission. \n\n\n[0132] The linker unit (L) is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected as long as it does not impair the effect of the invention. For example, a water-soluble linker such as ethylene glycol linker can be used. The length of the water-soluble linker can be determined to an appropriate length. \n\n\n [0133] In one aspect, either the influenza virus sample to be tested or the R-L-S complex is immobilized on a solid surface as an array. The solid surface may be selected from the group consisting of Langmuir Blodgett film, glass, germanium, silicon, (poly)tetrafluoroethylene, polystyrene, gallium arsenide, gallium phosphide, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, and combinations thereof. The solid surface may be any one selected from the group consisting of a microwell or microtiter plates or dishes, silicon chips, glass slides, beads, microparticles, films or membranes, bottles, dishes, slides, blotting material, filters, fibers, woven fibers, shaped polymers, particles, dip-sticks, test tubes, chips, and microchips. \n\n [0134] In one embodiment, the influenza virus and/or virus particles are bound to a support containing at least one type of carbohydrate receptor selected from the group consisting of natural or synthetic oligosaccharide, which is conjugated to, or situated in composition with glycoproteins like glycophorin, αΐ-acid glycoprotein, a2-macroglobulin, ovomucoid, and combinations thereof which carbohydrate receptor binds to the hemagglutinin component of the viruses and/or virus particles. In particular, influenza viruses and/or virus particles comprising all known Avian Influenza (AI) sub-types that are normally sensitive to Tamiflu® can detected. The method is suitable to detect influenza viruses and/or virus particles comprising a highly pathogenic variant that is resistant to Tamiflu®. The invention can be performed in particular with a support which is a chromatographic paper or membrane. Such materials are well-known to the skilled person. According to the invention it is possible to covalently attach or physically adsorb the carbohydrate receptor to the support. (US Pub. Pat App. Ser. No. 20100009339). \n\n\n[0135] methods of the invention can be used with suspected influenza virus containing samples selected from the group consisting of mucus, saliva, respiratory secretion, throat wash, nasal wash, spinal fluid, sputum, urine, semen, sweat, feces, plasma, blood, broncheoalveolar fluid, vaginal fluid, tear fluid and tissue biopsy. Similar techniques are also applicable for use with virus samples from cell culture, e.g., influenza samples grown in cells such as Vero cells, etc. The methods of the invention are suitable for practicing on intact influenza virus-infected cells or cell-free samples of influenza virus. The influenza virus can be of mammalian (human, equine, swine, etc.) or avian origin. \n\n\n Kits \n\n\n [0136] Kits which comprise the neuraminidase binding molecules of the present invention are also envisaged. The different kit components may be packaged in separate containers and admixed immediately before use. Such packaging of the components separately may permit long- term storage without losing the active components' functions. Embodiments in which two or more of components are found in the same container are also contemplated. An exemplary kit may comprise one or more of the following reagents: a wash buffer reagent for use using heterogeneous assays; a negative control reagent free of a neuraminidase-binding capability; a signal generation reagent for development of a detectable signal from the signaling moiety; and a sample collection means such as a syringe, throat swab, or other sample collection device. The kits of the present invention may, if desired, be presented in a pack which may contain one or more units of the kit of the present invention. The pack may be accompanied by instructions for using the kit. The pack may also be accommodated by a notice associated with the container in a form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of laboratory \n\n supplements, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency of the form of the compositions. \n\n\n Exemplary embodiments of the binding molecules: \n\n\n [0137] The invention relates to detection of Tamiflu-resistant influenza virus strains by determining the binding ability of specific binding molecules having the structure recognition unit (R)— optional linker (L)— sensing unit (S). \n\n\n [0138] Examples of some embodiments of the binding molecule (BM) according to the invention are: \n\n\n BM 1: Zanamivir-Triazole Linker-Biotin \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0139] The linker containing a triazole group is formed by click chemistry (1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of alkyne and azide). Fluorescence labeled streptavidin is used to detect the biotin unit. \n\n\n BM 2: Zanamivir-Triazole Linker-Fluorescein \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [0140] Fluorescein has an absorption maximum at 494 nm and emission maximum of 521 nm (in water). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) is used to connect with the linker. Alternatively, other fluorescent entities such as Alexa dyes and quantum dots, can be used. \n\n BM 3: Zanamivir-Ethylene Glycol Linker-Biotin \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [0141] The length of ethylene glycol linker can be tuned from x \n\n\n BM 4: Zanamivir-Ethylene Glycol Linker-Fluorescein \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n BM 5: Tamiphosphor Guanidine-Linker-Biotin \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n [0142] Tamiphosphor guanidine binds both Tamiflu-sensitive and Tamiflu-resistant strains (H274Y) of influenza viruses. The Tamiphosphor guanidine monoester can be in the salt form, such as the ammonium salt. The aliphatic chain can have 1-6 carbons (x = 1-4) in the linker. Alternatively, the aliphatic chain can be replaced by ethylene glycol chain as shown in Example 3. \n\n\n BM 6: Tamiphosphor Guanidine-Ethylene Glycol Linker-Fluorescein \n\n\n \n\n BM 7: PhosphaZanamivir-Triazole Linker-Biotin \n\n\n\n\n\n [0143] PhosphaZanamivir can be in the salt form, such as the ammonium\n\n\nBM 8: PhosphaZanamivir-Ethylene Glycol Linker-Fluorescein \n\n\n\n\n\n [0144] PhosphaZanamivir can be in the salt form, such as the ammonium salt.\n\n\nBM 9: PhosphaZanamivir Monoester-Ethylene Glycol Linker-Biotin \n\n\n\n\n\n [0145] The length of ethylene glycol linker can be tuned from x = 1 to x = 4.\n\n\nBM 10: PhosphaZanamivir Monoester-Ethylene Glycol Linker-Fluorescein \n\n\n\n\n\n [0146] The length of ethylene glycol linker can be from x \n\n [0147] Other exemplars of influenza NA-binding molecules of the general structure R-L-S are disclosed in Kale, R. R. et al, Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130, 8169-8171 ; Mckimm-Breschkin, J. L. et al, Angew, Chem. Int. Ed. 2003, 42, 31 18-3121; Lu, C.-P. et al, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2005, 44, 6888-6892; Kimura, Y. et al, Tetrahedron Lett. 2009, 50, 3205-3208. \n\n\n[0148] The present disclosure for the first time reveals that NA-binding abilities of molecules of the structure R-L-S can be used to detect Tamiflu-resistant versions of influenza virus. \n\n\n Competitive binding of NA with oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) and R-L-S type binding molecules \n\n\n [0149] A biotin-conjugated zanamivir (ZB) that binds influenza neuraminidases effectively was prepared. In the presence of oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) as the competitor for zanamivir binding, OC susceptibility could be determined. The OC binding competition assay confirmed the dramatic increase of OC resistant H1N1 isolates from 2008 and the appearance of OC resistant pandemic 2009 H1 1 in Taiwan. The Resistance Assessment by Binding Competition (RABC) assay was used to develop a prototype \"point-of-care\" test for OC susceptibility assessment. The RABC-assay principle could be generally applicable to high throughput survey and quick diagnosis for drug susceptibility of pathogens. \n\n\n [0150] A biotin conjugated zanamivir (ZB) was prepared for this study (Fig. 1 A, Examples). ZB was made by conjugation of a biotin through a linker to zanamivir at the 7-OH position that can be derivatized without much reduction in neuraminidase inhibition (D. M. Andrews et al, Eur. J. Med. Chem. 34, 563 (1999); T. Honda et al, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 12, 1925 (2002); W. H. Wen et al, J. Med. Chem. 52, 4903 (2009)). The IC\n50\n value of ZB against neuraminidase was found to be 7.7 nM, higher than that of zanamivir (2.1 nM). ZB binding to influenza neuraminidase was demonstrated using neuraminidase transfected cells (Fig. 4), influenza infected cells (see Examples), and immobilized influenza viruses (Fig. IB). Being a potent neuraminidase inhibitor, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) could be an effective competitor for ZB binding to influenza viruses. \n\n\n [0151] Nevertheless, OC was also expected to be a poor competitor for the binding of the OC- resistant H274Y mutant that ZB binds equally well. Fig. IB shows that significant OC inhibition (p< 0.001) on ZB binding was shown in the measurements of 274H influenza virus with titers in the range of 10\n3\n— 10\n5\n PFU. A residual ZB binding about 3% was noticed in OC competition of higher titer 274H viral samples. In contrast, significant inhibition of ZB binding by competing OC was not observed in the OC resistant 274Y WSN virus at the same titers. \n\n\n[0152] The same observations were demonstrated using transformed and influenza infected cells (Figs. 11-14). We named this assay Resistance Assessment by Binding Competition, or \n\n RABC in short. We also showed that the RABC assay allows the detection of the OC-resistant 274Y mutants in mixed populations at greater than 10% resistant contents (Fig. 14). \n\n\n[0153] A total of 137 Taiwan seasonal H1 1 clinical isolates collected in the years 2005-2009 were queried by the RABC assay for OC susceptibilities. The viral samples were immobilized in anti-HlNl coated microplate wells and tested for binding using either 30 nM ZB or 30 nM ZB plus 150 nM OC in duplicate assays. The 5% residual ZB binding was used as the cut-off for OC susceptibility determination. The RABC assay results suggested that all tested seasonal H1N1 isolates collected before 2008 (Fig. 8A) or early in 2008 (Fig. 8B) were OC susceptible. Not until mid 2008, OC-resistant H1N1 was isolated in Taiwan (Fig. 8B). Similarly, 48 out of 50 seasonal H1N1 collected in 2009 were scored as OC resistant (Fig. 8C). We also examined the OC susceptibility of the pandemic 2009 H1N1 isolates collected in Taiwan. Figure 8D shows that isolates ##1^1 and isolates ##5-7 are OC susceptible and OC resistant viruses, respectively. The RABC assays of the seven strains were conducted in blind, and the results were later shown to be consistent with their OC susceptibility and sequence results. To evaluate the susceptibility prediction using the RABC assay, 60 isolates of the seasonal H1N1 samples described in Fig. 8A-C were randomly picked to analyze their neuraminidase sequences. All samples predicted as OC sensitive by the RABC assay have histidines, while those predicted to be OC resistant have tyrosines at the corresponding residue 274 of the neuraminidases (Table 2). To seek the possible presence of evolving resistant populations, we took a closer look of those samples with 3-5% residual ZB binding values. Analyses of several isolated viral plaques from these samples failed to identify OC resistant viruses by binding or sequence analyses. \n\n\n [0154] Table 2 lists all Taiwan clinical H1N1 isolates used in this study for determination of their OC susceptibility status by the RABC assays. Sixty viral isolates were randomly selected to determine their sequences at amino acid 274 (AA274; N2 nomenclature) of the viral \n\n\nneuraminidase. In addition, a few samples were tested using the quick assay on membrane for OC susceptibility determinations. No discrepancies were found in all assay results, indicating that the RABC is reliable for OC susceptibility determinations. \n\n\n Table 2. OC susceptibility determination of Taiwan seasonal H1N1 isolates. \n\n\n The OC susceptibility of each influenza isolate determined by the RABC assay is designated as R (resistant) or S (susceptible) according to the results of Fig. 8. Several isolates were randomly picked for confirmation by analysis of AA274 and (or) quick test on a membrane (the numbers in parentheses corresponding to the sample number used in Fig.8B). \n\n\n \n\n2009-02548 R Tyr 2008-90003 S S (49)\n\n\n2009-02020 R 2008 -09020 S His \n\n\n 2009-01051 R 2008 -11548 R \n\n\n 2009-01022 R 2008 -05866 R Tyr \n\n\n 2009-00516 R 2008 -05860 R Tyr \n\n\n 2009-00513 R 2008 -05859 R Tyr \n\n\n 2009-00512 R 2008 -05858 R Tyr \n\n\n 2009-01524 R Tyr 2008 -05857 R Tyr \n\n\n 2009-00521 R 2008 -11547 R \n\n\n 2009-00519 R 2008 -00286 R Tyr \n\n\n 2009-00518 R 2008 -05855 R Tyr \n\n\n 2009-04512 R 2008 -02901 R \n\n\n 2009-00511 R 2008 -00279 R Tyr \n\n\n 2009-03518 R 2008 -00839 R \n\n\n 2009-03019 R Tyr 2008 -00275 R \n\n\n 2009-03005 R Tyr 2008 -08451 R Tyr \n\n\n 2009-90010 R 2008 -00273 R \n\n\n 2009-02530 R Tyr 2008 -09159 R Tyr \n\n\n 2009-02027 R Tyr 2008 -09042 R Tyr R (33)\n\n\n2009-02031 R 2008 -08949 R Tyr \n\n\n 2009-01026 R Tyr 2008 -08885 S His \n\n\n 2009-04511 R Tyr 2008 -05853 R Tyr \n\n\n 2009-01518 R 2008 -08416 S His \n\n\n 2009-01516 R 2008 -00258 S His \n\n\n 2009-04017 R 2008 -10103 R Tyr R(26)\n\n\n2009-03522 R Tyr 2008 -06758 R Tyr \n\n\n 2009-03507 R 2008 -02885 R Tyr \n\n\n 2009-03003 R Tyr 2008 -06723 S His \n\n\n 2009-03002 R Tyr 2008 -10099 R Tyr \n\n\n 2009-02022 R 2008 -10095 S His \n\n\n 2009-01043 R 2008 -08319 S His \n\n\n 2009-03006 R 2008 -02832 R Tyr R(19)\n\n\n2009-00024 R Tyr 2008 -00233 S His S (18)\n\n\n2009-04010 R Tyr 2008 -05506 S His S (17)\n\n\n2009-00515 R Tyr 2008 -07903 S \n\n\n 2009-00514 R 2008 -07895 R R(16)\n\n\n2009-00510 R 2008 -07860 R Tyr R(13)\n\n\n2009-04503 R Tyr 2008 -02808 S His \n\n\n 2009-01514 R 2008 -05815 S His \n\n\n 2009-01021 S His 2008 -03293 S \n\n\n 2009-02013 R 2008 -09169 S \n\n\n 2009-04007 R 2008 -04240 S \n\n 2009 -02010 R Tyr 2008-03135 S \n\n\n 2009 -01522 S His 2008-02612 S \n\n\n 2008 -03020 S His S(73) 2008-04226 S \n\n\n 2009 -00009 R 2008-04063 S \n\n\n 2009 -00008 R Tyr 2008-04169 S \n\n\n 2008 -11526 R Tyr 2007-05601 S \n\n\n 2008 -00846 R 2007-02774 S \n\n\n 2008 -00842 R 2007-02578 S \n\n\n 2008 -09219 R 2007-05222 S \n\n\n 2008 -00843 R 2007-04656 S \n\n\n 2008 -02904 R 2007-02820 S \n\n\n 2008 -09202 R 2007-02523 S \n\n\n 2008 -05878 R Tyr 2007-02864 S \n\n\n 2008 -09201 R 2007-03700 S \n\n\n 2008 -06020 S His S(64) 2007-02782 S \n\n\n 2008 -05879 R Tyr 2006-05288 S \n\n\n 2008 -02906 R 2006-06542 S \n\n\n 2008 -08884 S His 2006-00061 S \n\n\n 2008 -09200 R Tyr 2006-05751 S \n\n\n 2008 -09199 R 2006-00010 S \n\n\n 2008 -02415 R Tyr 2006-04130 S \n\n\n 2008 -00841 R 2005-05524 S \n\n\n 2008 -10128 R Tyr 2005-10393 S \n\n\n 2008 -02418 R 2005-05515 s \n\n\n 2008 -05877 R Tyr 2005-03468 s \n\n\n 2008 -00302 R \n\n\naCDC virus names \n\n\nbOC susceptibility \n\n\n Point of care assay \n\n\n [0155] Disclosed herein is a prototype assay on membrane for visual assessment of the OC susceptibility state of the influenza viruses. Fig.9A shows that the staining of the OC susceptible HlNl (WSN) by ZB was blocked by OC competition while the staining of the OC resistant 274Y WSN was resistant to the same competition. We used the staining on membrane to confirm the status of the OC susceptibility of several seasonal and pandemic HlNl isolates (Fig.9B and 9C). The sensitive ZB binding was also demonstrated on HlNl, H3N2, H5N1, and flu B influenza viruses that were directly immobilized on a membrane (Fig.9D). The prototype RABC based staining assay is quick and requires no instruments for detections. It could be used as a \"point-of- care\" assay in a doctor's office for timely decision on treatment options for the seasonal HlNl or pandemic HlNl infections. In addition, the test could be used to differentiate influenza virus \n\n versus other respiratory infections as most other respiratory infective pathogens do not have neuraminidases. \n\n\n [0156] The RABC assay is a simple and robust method and has been demonstrated on different influenza viruses and infected cells using a variety of assay platforms. The assay principle could be applicable to other pathogen targets for drug susceptibility assessments. \n\n\nEXAMPLES \n\n\n [0157] Without intent to limit the scope of the invention, exemplary instruments, apparatus, methods and their related results according to the embodiments of the present invention are given below.

(Taipei, Taiwan). \n\n\n EXAMPLE 24: Development of the OC susceptibility assay using neuraminidase expressing cells. \n\n\n [0193] The neuraminidase inhibitory activities of zanamivir and ZB were compared and it was found that ZB is still a very potent inhibitor for neuraminidase with an IC5\n0\n of 7 nM although it is slightly less active then zanamivir with an IC5\n0\n of 2 nM. Functional neuraminidase expressed on the cell surface could be useful as a model system for ZB binding and OC competition for OC susceptibility assessments. The cDNA for the neuraminidase of A/Hanoi/30408/2005 (H5N1) was cloned in an expression plasmid and used to transfect 293T cells for the expression of the wild type (274H) neuraminidase. The expressed neuraminidase was found to be located mainly on the cell surface allowing the binding and labeling using ZB (Fig. 10). The neuraminidase cDNA was mutagenized for the expression of the OC resistant 274Y mutant enzyme. Both the wild type and the mutagenized cDNA were used to generate stable 293T cell lines for the expression of the 274H and 274Y neuraminidases, respectively. Mixtures of these two cells at different ratios were incubated with ZB or ZB plus excess OC and then decorated with APC \n\n conjugated streptavidin to determine the population of cells that bind ZB by flow cytometry analyses. Fig. 11 shows that ZB bound 274H and 274Y expressing cells to similar extents. In the presence of excess OC, ZB binding was completely blocked in cells expressing 274H neuraminidase, whereas ZB binding to the 274Y expressing cells was virtually unaltered (Fig. 12). These results prove the principle that ZB binding can be used to differentiate OC-sensitive and OC-resistant neuraminidases by OC competition. \n\n\n EXAMPLE 25: Determination of OC susceptibility using influenza virus infected cells. \n\n\n [0194] The results of the competitive OC inhibition on ZB binding using NA expressing cells had prompted us to define the concentrations of ZB and OC to assess the OC susceptibility of influenza viruses. MDCK cells infected with either OC susceptible or OC resistant WSN viruses were used to test feasibility of the OC susceptibility assessment using varied ZB and OC concentrations. Fig. 13A shows OC competition of ZB binding to influenza virus infected MDCK cells. By labeling influenza infected cells with either 10 or 50 nM ZB, OC susceptibility of infecting viruses could be inferred from the competition binding with OC at 0.5-10 fold concentrations of the labeling ZB. For example, clear distinction of OC susceptible and OC resistant WSN variants was observed by treating infected cells using labeling ZB at 30 nM and competing OC at 150 nM (Fig. 13B). \n\n\n [0195] MDCK cells were infected with either wild type (274H) or OC resistant (274Y) WSN viruses. At 16-20 hr post-infection, the infected cells were treated either with 30 nM ZB or with 30 nM ZB plus 150 nM OC. The resulting cells were decorated with streptavidin-FITC, washed and observed using a fluorescence microscope. For flow cytometry studies, the ZB labeled cells were further labeled using anti-NP antibody, trypsinized, and then treated with PE-conjugated streptavidin plus DyLight-649 labeled anti-rabbit second antibody, both were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA, USA). After additional washings, the cells were analyzed by FACSCanto of BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA). For analysis of more samples, a high throughput method was developed using black 96-well clear bottom microplates to culture infected cells. At 16-20 hr post-infection, cells were labeled with 30 nM ZB or 30 nM ZB plus 150 nM OC, washed, and treated with PE-streptavidin. The plates were then scanned with the Isocyte™ laser scanning platform of Molecular Device (Mountain View, CA, USA) at 488 nm. \n\n\n EXAMPLE 26: Estimation of OC resistant contents using immobilized influenza samples. \n\n\n [0196] As described with reference to Fig. 7B, the RABC assay is applicable for OC susceptibility determinations using immobilized viruses in micro-wells. The RABC assay using immobilized viruses could also be used to estimate the contents of OC resistant mutants in a \n\n mixed population consisting of both OC susceptible and resistant viruses. Viral samples at different ratios of 274H and 274Y WSN viruses in total viral contents at 10\n3\n, 10\n4\n, and 10\n5\n PFU per well were immobilized to measure OC resistant ZB binding as an estimation of OC resistant contents. Fig. 14 shows that the estimated OC resistant contents matched well with the experimental 274Y viral contents that are greater than 10%. For mixed populations containing less than 10% resistant viruses, over-estimation of the resistant contents was observed probably due to the background binding that are higher in assays using high titer viral samples. \n\n\n[0197] High binding 96-well microplates 655061 from Greiner Bio-One (Frickenhausen, Germany) were coated overnight with anti-HA antibody (Abeam) at 150 ng per well and then blotted using PBS with 3% BSA. Influenza samples were treated with 30 nM ZB or 30 nM ZB plus 150 nM OC for 30 min and added to antibody coated wells. After incubation for 30 min, the microwells were washed with 3% BSA in PBS, added with alkaline phosphatase conjugated streptavidin for 30min, washed again with BSA in PBS and then added with the luminescence substrate Emerald-II™ according to the instruction of the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The RLU (Relative Luminescence Unit) was read using Envision from Perkin Elmer (Waltham, MA, USA). Percent relative resistance was calculated as the percent RLU determined for ZB binding measured in the presence of OC divided by total RLU for ZB binding measured in the absence of OC competition.. \n\n\n EXAMPLE 27: Determination of influenza neuraminidase sequences. \n\n\n [0198] Total RNA was extracted from influenza viruses using High Pure Viral RNA kit from Roche Diagnostics purchased at Taipei Pharma (Taipei, Taiwan). The RNA samples were reverse transcribed using random hexamers and the MMLV RTase of Toyobo Life Science Department (Tokyo, Japan) for the synthesis of cDNA that was amplified by PCR using two primers 5'- tggtcagcaagtgcwtgccatg, and 5'-gacactggaccacaactgcct at 200 nM. The DNA products were purified and used to determine the NA sequences. \n\n\n EXAMPLE 28: Rapid detection of OC susceptibility of influenza viruses on membrane. \n\n\n [0199] PVDF membrane mounted on Bio-Dot SF of Bio-Rad Inc. (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) was wetted with methanol and added with 1 μg anti-HA antibody (Abeam) per slot by suction. \n\n\nInfluenza viral samples that were previously treated for 1 hr with either 30 nM ZB or 30 nM ZB plus 150 nM OC were introduced to neighboring slots by suction. The membranes were blotted using PBS with 3% BSA and then incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated streptavidin from KPL (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After additional washing using PBS with 3% BSA, alkaline phosphatase substrate, Amresco El 16 \n\n solution of Amresco Inc. (Solon, OH, USA) was added for color development. Visible color usually was developed in 2 minutes and recorded by photography. \n\n\n EXAMPLE 29: Preparation of 293T cells stably expressing recombinant wild type (274H) and OC resistant (274Y) neuraminidases. \n\n\n [0200] The cDNA sequence of the neuraminidase gene deduced from influenza \n\n\nA/Hanoi/30408/2005 (H5N1) (GeneBank: AB239126.1) was used to prepare a synthetic version of this gene by Geneart (Regensburg, Germany) and cloned into the BamHl and Xhol restriction sites of pCDNA3.1 of Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA) as pCDNA3.1-NA. The A gene was modified using QuickChange® XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Agilent Technology (La Jolla, CA, USA) to produce OC resistant NA mutant of H274Y using a pair of primers: 5'- gCTggACgCTCCCAACTACCACTACgAggAgTg-3' and 5'- gTAgTTgggAgCgTCCAgCTCCACggAC-3. Both the wild type (274H) and the OC resistant mutant (274Y) NA genes were validated by sequence analyses. These NA genes were used for transient NA expressions for wild type and OC resistant neuraminidases. They were also cloned into the pRetro-IRES-GFP vector of Clontech (Mountain View, CA, USA) as pRetro-NA(274H)- IRES-GFP and pRetro-NA(274Y)-IRES-GFP, respectively. Recombinant retroviruses made using these two plasmids and pGagPol, and pVSVG were used to transduce 293T cells. Stable cell lines were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter for populations expressing GFP over 95% and validated for the synthesis of OC susceptible or resistant neuraminidases. \n\n\n[0201] All publications and patent applications cited in this specification are herein \n\n\nincorporated by reference as if each individual publication or patent application were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. \n\n\n [0202] Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in light of the teachings of this invention that certain changes and modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the appended claim."

Description\n\n\n\n\n PROGRAMMABLE SELF-ASSEMBLED NANOSTRUCTURES BASED ON SIDE CHAIN-MODIFIED PNA FOR THE MULTIVALENT DISPLAY OF LIGANDS \n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS \n\n\n [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. \n\n\n61/333,442, filed May 11 , 2010, which is incorporated by reference herein. \n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD \n\n\n [0002] The instant invention concerns compositions comprising polynucleotide and polynucleobase strands which serve as multivalent display ligands. \n\n\nBACKGROUND \n\n\n [0003] Multivalent (or polyvalent) interactions refer to the simultaneous binding of multiple ligands on the surface of one molecular entity to multiple receptors on another. The strength and specificity of multivalent interactions depends on the cumulative effect of all the ligands and all the receptors involved in the process. Within a multivalent array, a single, isolated ligand-receptor interaction may actually be weak; however, the combined effect of multiple ligand-receptor interactions can be very strong. Such multivalent interactions occur throughout biology, and are important in numerous processes, such as those involving receptors at the surfaces of cells. For example, cell attachment, wound healing, and the immune response are basic examples where multivalent interactions are important. Therefore, multivalent interactions can be directly linked to cancer metastasis, blood clotting, and the generation of antibodies from a vaccination (see generally, Mammen et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 37:2754- 94 (1998)). \n\n\n [0004] Mimicking multivalent interactions on a synthetic scaffold is challenging, especially when large numbers of ligands (such as 5 or more) need to be displayed. There are numerous synthetic scaffolds that have been developed, but there are significant limitations that remain. Ideally, a scaffold for the multivalent display of ligands should be easily manipulated to display anywhere from 1 up to about 200 ligands in a controlled manner. Well-defined synthetic scaffolds have been developed for the display of small numbers of ligands. Such systems are good because a single synthetic entity can be made and isolated, but it is rare that such systems display more than 5 ligands. Beyond this, well-defined synthetic scaffolds become very \n\n challenging to make. To study the multivalent effects of larger numbers of ligands, scientists rely on synthetic systems that are less well-defined and consist of mixtures. In this area, it is common to use polymers, dendrimers, proteins, and synthetic nanostructures (such as gold nanoparticles) as the synthetic scaffold to support larger numbers of ligands. Unfortunately, these larger systems are heterogeneous mixtures where the number of ligands per scaffold cannot be rigorously defined. In these cases, scientists determine an average number of ligands per scaffold or report the range of ligands per scaffold. Heterogeneous mixtures are often not acceptable by FDA standards for application as a therapeutic. As such, improved scaffolds are needed. \n\n\nSUMMARY \n\n\n [0005] In some aspects, the invention concerns composition comprising: strands of polynucleotide and strands of PNA, each PNA strand comprising: (i) from 2 to 50 nucleobase subunits; and (ii) one or more gamma substituents; the PNA strands being complementary to at least a portion of at least some of the polynucleotide strands, and the molar ratio of PNA strands to polynucleotide strands being at least 1 : 1. In some preferred embodiments, the polynucleotide strands are DNA. Some DNAs comprise at least 120 nucleotide subunits. In some embodiments the DNAs are single stranded. In other embodiments, RNA is the preferred polynucleotide. In some embodiments the RNAs are single stranded. Some RNAs comprise at least 120 nucleotide subunits. Certain embodiments contain PNA with a backbone having at least one cyclopentyl residue. \n\n\n [0006] Some compositions of the invention have gamma substituents that are capable of binding to a receptor on the surface of a cell, binding to a cell surface molecule, or eliciting an immune response. In some embodiments, the molar ratio of PNA strands to polynucleotide strands is 2 : 1 to 10 : 1. In certain embodiments, the ratio is 3 : 1 to 7 : 1 or 4 : 1 to 6 : 1. \n\n\n 1 2 \n\n\n [0007] Preferred gamma substituents, independently, include -R-NX X , where: R is a\n\n\n1 2 \n\n\n C1-C12 alkyl; X and X are, independently, H, biomolecules, fluorescent groups, metal ligands, \n\n\n 1 2 \n\n\n Michael acceptors, azides, alkynes, or thiols; where at least one ofX\n1\n and X\" are other than H.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, X 1 and X 2 are, independently, H, biotin, fluorescein, thiazole orange, acridine, pyrene, Alexafluor Dyes, polypeptide, sugars (such as mannose or lactose), nucleic acid derivatives, oligonucleotides, RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) or cyclic RGD. Additional groups and ligands that may be attached to the multivalent nano peptide nucleic acid (MNP) for multivalent display include, but are not limited to, cyclodextrins, porphyrins, polyhedral cage compounds containing boron, and the compositions depicted in Figure 19 (such as, biotin, 1,4,7,10- \n\n tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N\",N\"-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTP A), a cryptand, a crown ether (12-crown-4, 15-crown-5, 18-crown-6, dibenzo-18-crown-6, and diaza-18-crown-6, or derivatives, for example), a pyridine-containing ligand, or calixarenes (such as calix[4]arenes, e.g., cone-4-tert-butylcalix[4]arenetetra(diethylamide), and \n\n\n 1 2 \n\n\ncalix[6]arenes). In some embodiments, derivatives of the aforementioned X and X groups and ligands may be utilized. In addition to gamma substituents, the N-terminal PNA residues of the compounds described herein can also include substituents (R2 and R3) on the nitrogens of the N- termini. Accordingly, a single PNA residue can have up to 3 substituents, one gamma substituent and two terminal substituents. \n\n\n [0008] In some embodiments the individual PNA residues described herein can have one substituent. In some instances this substituent will be conjugated to the gamma carbon of the PNA residue. In some embodiments this substituent will be conjugated to the terminal nitrogen of the PNA residue. A PNA residue of this nature will be an individual residue in some embodiments. However, it may also be one of multiple PNAs in a larger strand. In some embodiments the PNAs described herein can be complexed with DNA to form an MNP. \n\n\n [0009] In some embodiments the individual PNA residues described herein can have two substituents. In some instances at least one of the two substituents will be conjugated to the gamma carbon of the PNA residue. In some embodiments, at least one of the two substituents will be conjugated to a terminal nitrogen residue. In some instances at least one of the two substituents will be conjugated to the gamma carbon of the PNA residue and the other will be conjugated to a terminal nitrogen residue. A PNA residue of this nature will be an individual residue in some embodiments. However, it may also be one of multiple PNAs in a larger strand. In some embodiments the PNAs described herein can be complexed with DNA to form an MNP. \n\n\n [0010] In some embodiments the individual PNA residues described herein can have three substituents. In some instances at least one of the substituents will be conjugated to the gamma carbon of the PNA residue. In some embodiments, two substituents will be conjugated to a terminal nitrogen residue. In some instances at least one of the substituents will be conjugated to the gamma carbon of the PNA residue and the other two will be conjugated to a terminal nitrogen residue. A PNA residue of this nature will be an individual residue in some embodiments. However, it may also be one of multiple PNAs in a larger strand. In some embodiments the PNAs described herein can be complexed with DNA to form an MNP. \n\n\n [0011] The invention also concerns methods of treating or inhibiting a disease state in a mammal comprising administering to said mammal an effective amount of a compound described herein wherein at least some of the gamma substituents are selected to bind to a \n\n receptor on the surface of a cell associated with said disease state, to hinder the ability of a cell surface molecule to interact with a ligand that may trigger or prolong a disease state, or elicit an immune response.. In some embodiments, the disease state is related to, independently, cancer; infectious diseases caused by HIV, influenza, rhinovirus, rotavirus, E. coli, anthrax or cholera; diabetes (type 2), Chagas disease, chronic inflammatory diseases, and autoimmune diseases (see generally, Hecht et al., Curr. Opin. in Chem. Biol, 13:354-59 (2009) and Mammen et al.).. \n\n\n [0012] In yet another aspect, the invention concerns methods of forming nanostructure platforms comprising contacting polynucleotide with PNA strands, wherein said PNA strands comprise: \n\n\n (i) from 2 to 50 nucleobase subunits, and \n\n\n (ii) one or more gamma substituents; \n\n\n wherein the molar ratio of said PNA strands to said one or more polynucleotide strands is greater than 1 : 1 and said PNA strands are complementary to a portion of said polynucleotide strands. The PNA and DNA strands are as described herein. \n\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n\n\n [0013] Figure 1 presents a general scheme where 2 MNPs (each with one gamma sidechain) bind to a complementary oligonucleotide. More than one gamma sidechain, however, may be attached to the MNP (in other examples 2, 3, and 5 sidechains are attached, and more are possible). By using a longer oligonucleotide, more than just 2 MNPs may be assembled for multivalent display. Variation in the number of gamma sidechains and the sequence of the oligonucleotide can be used to create well-defined multivalent arrays of ligands attached to the MNP so that anywhere from 1 to 200 copies of the ligand are displayed. The distance between adjacent MNPs on the oligonucleotide can also be varied by altering the oligonucleotide's sequence to include segments that are non-complementary to the MNP. \n\n\n [0014] Figure 2 presents a general scheme where 2 different MNPs (each with a different nucleobase base sequence and each one with a gamma sidechain that has its own ligand) bind to a complementary oligonucleotide that has a sequence to recognize both MNP sequences. Again, more than one gamma sidechain may be attached to either MNP. \n\n\n [0015] Figure 3 shows constructs one side chain (no peg)PNA-(no peg)RGD and one side chain (peg)PNA-(no peg)RGD. \n\n\n [0016] Figure 4 shows constructs one side chain (peg)PNA-(peg)RGD and one side chain (long peg)PNA-(peg)RGD. \n\n\n [0017] Figure 5 shows a N-terminal side chain PNA-RGD construct. \n\n [0018] Figure 6 shows a two-side chain PNA-RGD construct. \n\n\n [0019] Figure 7 shows a three-side chain PNA-RGD construct. \n\n\n [0020] Figure 8 shows a three-side-chain PNA-poly mannose derivative. \n\n\n [0021] Figure 9 shows a five-side-chain PNA-Lactose construct. \n\n\n [0022] Figure 10 shows one side chain (no peg)PNA and one side chain (two peg linker)PNA constructs. \n\n\n [0023] Figure 11 shows N-Terminal Side Chain PNA construct. \n\n\n [0024] Figure 12 shows a two-side chain (two peg linkers) PNA construct. \n\n\n [0025] Figure 13 shows three-side chain (two peg linkers) PNA and five-side-chain PNA constructs. \n\n\n [0026] Figure 14 shows Tm data from PNAs with various gamma-sidechains. \n\n\n [0027] Figure 15 shows IC\n50\n data for various multivalent constructs. \n\n\n [0028] Figure 16 presents a schematic for attaching an agonist for an adenosine receptor (A2A) to a PNA. \n\n\n [0029] Figure 17 presents a schematic for attaching an agonist for an adenosine receptor (A2A) to a PNA. \n\n\n [0030] Figure 18 presents a schematic for attaching an agonist for an adenosine receptor (A2A) to a PNA. \n\n\n [0031] Figure 19 presents structures of representative groups and ligands that can be attached to the MNP for multivalent display. \n\n\n [0032] Figure 20 shows metastatic tumor foci in mouse lungs for mice treated with either vehicle (negative control), monovalent cyclic RGD ligand, or an MNP conjugated to 15 cyclic RGD ligands. \n\n\n [0033] Figure 21 provides a graphical illustration of the tumor foci shown in figure 21. \n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS \n\n\n [0034] The technology of the present invention overcomes the barriers that persist for the current multivalent scaffolds. The technology uses peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) which are backbone substituted to provide a multivalent scaffold (MNP). Preferably in the MNP, one or more sidechains have been introduced at one or more gamma carbons of the PNA backbone. \n\n\n [0035] PNAs are synthetic molecules that possess the bases derived from DNA. \n\n\n Similar to DNA, the sequence of bases on a PNA determines the complementary sequence of nucleic acids to which a PNA will bind. Preferred sidechains at the gamma carbon of PNA have a nitrogen atom to facilitate attachment of ligands to the sidechains that extend off of the \n\n backbone. The term \"gamma-sidechain-modified PNAs as Multivalent Nano PNA\" (MNP) is used to highlight that these molecules are being used for the multivalent display of ligands on a nanoscale synthetic scaffold. \n\n\n [0036] The MNPs can interact with a polynucleotide to form a complex where the ratio of MNP to polynucleotide is greater than 1 : 1. Suitable polynucleotides include DNA, RNA, and even synthetic polynucleobases such as PNA. The DNA and RNA may be natural or synthetic constructs. While in some embodiments, the preferred polynucleotide is DNA, it is understood that when DNA is used in an example or to describe an embodiment of the invention, that other polynucleotides may be utilized instead of DNA. As used herein, the terms \"polynucleotide\" and \"oligonucleotide\" are used interchangeably. In some embodiments, oligonucletides have 200 or fewer bases. \n\n\n [0037] In one application of the invention, MNP is used alone to target proteins. In this application, the arrangement of sidechains on the MNP can create a unique three-dimensional display that is guided in part by the intramolecular interactions of the nucleobases. Such a folded structure can be used as a binder to proteins, similar to aptamers. Aptamers are single-stranded oligonucleotides that are generated through an in vitro selection and evolution process called SELEX (which stands for Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment). The evolution process for SELEX depends on employing several rounds of enzymatic amplification of oligonucleotide sequences that are selected to have good binding properties to a particular target. An example of a drug that has been developed from an aptamer is Macugen (Pegaptanib). Since aptamers composed of DNA and RNA are themselves susceptible to nuclease degradation, the field has made significant efforts to find synthetic derivatives that are sufficiently stable for therapeutic applications. While it is not possible to use the same evolution process for MNPs, library screening for protein binding may be used to identify MNPs that target proteins. \n\n\n [0038] The MNPs described herein can be used to target protein. In some instances targeted proteins will be cell surface proteins. For example, cell surface proteins that are targets can be transmembrane proteins, lipid-anchored proteins, or peripheral proteins. Accordingly, the targeted proteins can be a cellular receptor or cellular adhesion molecule. In some instances the cell surface protein is an integrin. In some embodiments, the integrin may be ιβι\n,\n α\n2\nβι\n,\n α\n4\nβι\n,\n α\n4\nβ\n7\n, α\n5\nβι, α\n6\nβι, ¾β\n2\n, Μβ\n2;\n αι¾β\n3\n, \nν\nβ\n3\n, \nν\nβ\n5\n, οΐνβδ, \nΟΓ α\n6β In some embodiments described herein the disclosed MNPs may be used to bind to, or disrupt the activity of integrin α\n6\nβ\n4\n. In some embodiments the targeted protein may be a G-coupled surface protein, such as a receptor. In other embodiments the cell surface proteins are ion channel linked receptors. In some embodiments the targeted protein may be an enzyme-linked receptor protein. In some aspects \n\n the targeted protein is a cadherin, such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, cadherin 12, or P-cadherin. Selectins may also be targeted by the MNPs described herein. For example, E-selectin, P- selectin, or L-selectin may be targeted by the described MNPs. In some aspects, inter-cellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) is targeted by the MNPs described herein. In other \n\n\nembodiments, sialic acid on the cell surface may be targeted. C-type lectins may also be targeted by the MNPs described herein. For example, some C-type lectins that may be targeted include: lecticans, asialoglycoprotein and DC receptors, collectins, NK cell receptors, multi-CTLD endocytic receptors, and thrombomodulin to name only a few. In addition, toll-like receptors may be targeted by the described MNPs. Some toll-like receptors that may be targeted include TLR 1, TLR 2, TLR 3, TLR 4, TLR 5, TLR 6, TLR 7, TLR 8, TLR 9, TLR 10, TLR 11, TLR 12, or TLR 13. \n\n\n [0039] Another application of MNP is to assemble multiple copies on a single-stranded nucleic acid (such as DNA, RNA, or any other type of synthetic nucleic acid mimic, like PNA or locked nucleic acid or LNA). Assembly in this manner acts as the template to assemble multiple MNPs. For example, a MNP that consists of 12 bases and has one ligand attached to a sidechain, can display 10 of these ligands in a multivalent array by complexing this MNP to a 120-base DNA sequence that has the appropriate complementary sequence to the MNP. With this system, a library of different entities with different numbers of ligands can readily be produced. For instance, switching from displaying 10 ligands to 5 is easily accomplished by simply using a different (shorter) DNA and the same MNP. With this system, one is not restricted to just one ligand per MNP. The chemistry of the present invention allows attachment of multiple sidechains to the original PNA sequence so that, if desired, a sidechain can be attached at every position in the final MNP. In this case, a 12 base MNP with a ligand-b earing sidechain at every position in the backbone could be used to display 120 ligands if assembled onto a 120-base DNA sequence that has the complementary sequence repeated 10 times. The versatility and accuracy of the system of the present invention is unparalleled by current multivalent scaffolds because we can display anywhere from 1 up to about 200 ligands simply by proper selection of the number of sidechains on the MNP and the corresponding DNA (or other type of oligonucleotide) assembly sequence. \n\n\n [0040] Another advantage of the system of the present invention is that one accurately knows the number of ligands displayed in each case because the interaction between MNP and\n\n\nDNA is well-defined. Furthermore, one can easily change the distance between adjacent ligands on the scaffold by inserting sections of non-complementary DNA sequences in between the\n\n\nMNP -binding portions of the DNA. An additional feature of this system is that it allows display \n\n of different types of ligands in a controlled, spatially-addressable manner. For example, if 2 different ligands (LI and L2) each need to be displayed 3 times but in different specific orders (for example L1-L1-L1-L2-L2-L2 vs. L1-L2-L1-L2-L1-L2) this can be accomplished with the present system. To do this, one would make two different MNP nucleobase sequences (MNP1 and MNP2) and then attach LI to the sidechain of MNP 1 and L2 to the sidechain of MNP2. Examining the different order of ligands can be accomplished by making the appropriate DNA sequence to display the ligands in the desired order. This process can be extended to more ligands. For instance, to display 10 different substituents (LI, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7, L8, L9, L10) one would design ten different MNPs, each with a unique polynucleobase sequence, and attach one ligand to each MNP. Each of the ten ligands could then be assembled onto a DNA sequence in a spatially-addressable manner. The technology uniquely allows small molecular rearrangements of multiple substituents to be explored. For the example of 10 substituents, the technology allows one to make ligand arrangements such as: L1-L2-L3-L4-L5-L6-L7-L8-L9- L10 or, reverse the position of LI and L2, to give L2-L1-L3-L4-L5-L6-L7-L8-L9-L10. With the ability to make libraries of DNA, one can even explore all combinations of the 10 substituents. The exploration of substituent libraries in this manner could also be extended to DNA microarray technology as a way to assemble the substituent library and subsequently screen for activity and sequence information. \n\n\n [0041] Those skilled in the art will understand that as many different substituents can be used as there are PNAs available for conjugation. Accordingly, the use of \"10\" substituents to illustrate the point of positional flexibility provided by the described system should not be seen as limiting. For example, MNPs described herein can be made of a PNA strand having 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ,8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 total substituents. In some embodiments all of the substituents on an MNP strand are the same. In other embodiments the substituents of the MNP strand differ. The degree to which substituents differ relative to one another can vary such that all of the substituents can be unique to the instance where about 5% are unique. Alternatively, about 10% of the substituents could be unique. In some embodiments about 15% of the substituents are unique. In some embodiments about 20%> of the substituents are unique. In some embodiments about 25%> of the substituents are unique. In some embodiments about 30%> of the substituents are unique. In some embodiments about 35%> of the substituents are unique. In some embodiments about 40%> of the substituents are unique. In some embodiments about 45%> of the substituents are unique. In some embodiments about 50%> of the substituents are unique. \n\n [0042] Additionally, with the multivalent assemblies of MNP -oligonucleotide complexes, crosslinking chemistry can be used to crosslink adjacent MNPs that are assembled onto the DNA. Covalent crosslinking of all (or some) the MNPs assembled on the DNA provides additional stability to the overall complex and likely provides stability for long-term storage. \n\n\n [0043] Figures 2-13 show illustrative PNA constructs that have 1-5 side chains. \n\n\nVarious side chains having moieties such as RGD and sugar derivatives (mannose and lactose, for example) are used in these examples. The structures in Figures 10-13 can be used to attach a substituent via the terminal nitrogen-containing functional group on the side chain. \n\n\n [0044] The present scaffolds can also feature multivalent assemblies of PNA-DNA complexes where adjacent PNAs that are assembled onto the DNA can be cross-linked. Covalent crosslinking of some or all of the PNAs assembled on the DNA would provide additional stability to the overall complex and likely provide stability for long-term storage. \n\n\n [0045] As used herein, the term \"MNP\" refers to \"multivalent nano PNA.\" MNP represents any PNA with a gamma sidechain in which there is a nitrogen atom somewhere in the sidechain. In some embodiments, MNP structure is represented by the following formula. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere R\n\n\n and m is 0 - 48, n is an integer from 1-5. B is a natural (A, T, G, C) or non-natural nucleobase (such as J, isoguanine, PPG). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIsoguanine PPG \n\n\n2 3 \n\n\n [0046] The range of groups for R and R can vary from alkyl (such as CH\n3\n and derivatives such as substituted alkyls), to aryl (such as phenyl and obvious derivatives), to acyl (such as acetamido), to more complex linkers (such as PEG and associated variations) at the end of which are attached ligands for biomolecules, fluorescent groups, metal ligands, or other reactive groups (such as Michael acceptors, azides, alkynes, thiols) that may be used as a handle \n\n\n 2 3 to attach other molecules. Some specific moieties that can be attached at the for R and R positions include biotin, fluorescein, thiazole orange, acridine, pyrene, Alexafluor Dyes, polypeptides, sugars (such as lactose, mannose, or other oligosaccharides), nucleic acid derivatives (such as agonists or antagonists for adenosine receptors), oligonucleotides (such as \n\n\n 2 3 \n\n\n G-quadruplexes). R and R may also be peptide ligands such as RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) and cyclic RGD. \n\n\n [0047] In addition to the examples listed above, any substituent that is useful in the desired biological interaction may be utilized in the present invention. Such moieties can be added to the PNA by standard chemical reactions and methods discussed herein. Examples of substituents which can be placed in the gamma position include primary amines, hydrophobic groups, polar groups, hydrophilic groups, aromatic groups, peptide ligands, receptor agonists, sugars, imaging agents, or mixtures thereof. \n\n\n [0048] In making the constructs of the present invention, gamma-substituents can be introduced based on their utility in interacting with specific receptors or other biological interaction sites. In a particular PNA, more than one substituent may be utilized. In a particular PNA/DNA scaffold, different PNAs may contain the same or different substituents depending on the target moiety. \n\n\n [0049] In addition to the PNA depicted above, any of the numerous PNA variations that are known in the art can be utilized. Known PNA compositions include compositions represented by the following structures. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatural and non-natural bases can be used in these structures and are well known by those skilled in the art. \n\n\n [0050] Scheme 1 depicts a method of synthesis of a gamma-substituted monomer that can be used to make a PNA. The gamma substituent can serve as a point for further \n\n\nfunctionalization. These monomers can be converted to PNAs by methods known in the art. See, for example, Englund, E. A.; Appella, D. H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2007, 46, 1414. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 50-55 % \n\n BocHN ' \n\n\nLiOH \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 1 \n\n\n[0051] In scheme 2, use of FMoc allows for deprotection and coupling of amine while on resin. Reaction conditions adjusted to accommodate base labile Fmoc group. Typically, ester conversion to acid done via hydrogenolysis rather than hydrolysis. See, for example, Englund, E. A.; Appella, D.

This scheme provides access to wide variety of functionality. It is possible to conjugate some or all residues to different type of moiety via this process. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 4 \n\n [0055] Figure 2 depicts γ-substituted PNA oligomers containing multiple/various moieties and their use in forming a scaffold using multiple γ-substitutes PNAs on a larger DNA strand/construct. Using sequence specificity of PNA/DNA to control location and variety of conjugates allows for a specific order of substituents and/or the spatial position of such substituents. Any suitable PNA and DNA compositions may be utilized. Certain DNA sequences are commercially available. Other sequences can be synthesized by methods well known to those skilled in the art. PNAs can be synthesized by know methods, some of which are depicted herein. \n\n\n [0056] As noted above, adjacent PNAs that are assembled onto the DNA can be cross- linked. Cross-linking reactive groups can be incorporated into PNAs by known techniques. In some embodiments, the cross-linking functional groups are attached in a terminal position in the PNA. \n\n\n [0057] Cross-linking can be accomplished by use of cross-reactive functional groups. Many cross-reactive functional groups are known in the art and can be used with the present invention. In some embodiments, the cross-reactive functional groups can be of the formulas I and II. Reaction of a molecule of Group I with Group II produces a linkage shown by formula \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[0058] Some preferred PNAs contain trans- 1 ,2-diaminocyclopentane which can potentially impact a broad range of scientific disciplines. Recent advances have improved the synthesis of trans- 1,2-diaminocyclopentane. See, PCT Patent Application No. \n\n PCT7US2007/020466. These methods allow each nitrogen atom of cyclopentanediamine to be easily derivatized with identical or dissimilar groups. Incorporation of trans-1,2- diaminocyclopentane into Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNAs) has a beneficial effect on the recognition of DNA and RNA sequences. \n\n\n [0059] Methods for PNA and cyclop entane-modified PNA synthesis and acquisition of melting temperature data can be found in Pokorski, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 15067. Addition of one or more cyclopentane groups into a PNA sequence improves the melting temperature to complementary DNA by ~5 °C per cyclopentane, regardless of which base is used. \n\n\n [0060] The scaffolds can be made by contacting the PNAs with DNA (or other polynucleotide) under standard conditions known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, Englund, E. A.; Appella, D. H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2007, 46, 1414. \n\n\n [0061] The scaffolds of the present invention can be utilized in pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions can be produced by adding an effective amount of the scaffold composition to a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. Such carriers and diluents are will known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\n [0062] The scaffolds and/or pharmaceutical compositions may be administered by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Such methods include local and systemic administration. In some embodiments, administration is topical. Such methods include ophthalmic administration and delivery to mucous membranes (including vaginal and rectal delivery), pulmonary (including inhalation of powders or aerosols; intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal and transdermal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or infusion; or intracranial (including intrathecal or intraventricular, administration). \n\n\n [0063] Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration include but are not limited to ointments, lotions, creams, transdermal patches, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Utilization of conventional pharmaceutical carriers, oily bases, aqueous, powder, thickeners and the like may be used in the formulations. \n\n\n [0064] The pharmaceutical compositions may also be administered in tablets, capsules, gel capsules, and the like. \n\n\n [0065] Penetration enhancers may also be used in the instant pharmaceutical compositions. Such enhancers include surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating non- surfactants. Such enhancers are generally described in U.S. Patent No. \n\n\n 6,287,860, which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n [0066] The scaffolds of the present invention find utility against diseases such as cancer (preventing metastasis, for example) and inhibition of HIV (by preventing attachment to the target cell's surface, for example). Other diseases include diabetes (Type 2), Chagas disease, chronic inflammatory diseases (such as celiac disease, vasculitis, lupus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, irritable bowel disease, atherosclerosis, arthritis, and psoriasis) and autoimmune diseases (such as diabetes mellitus type 1, Kawasaki disease, Graves' disease, Scleroderma). \n\n\n [0067] In other applications, the scaffolds of the present invention can be utilized to generate vaccines. In one embodiment, a vaccine agent can be attached to a MNP of the instant invention. The vaccine agent can be a moiety that resembles a disease-causing microorganism such as a weakened or killed forms of the microbe or its toxins. Attachment to the MNP can be made using standard chemical techniques at positions of the MNP discussed herein. For example, antigens from anthrax and cholera can be attached to the scaffolds, which can be combined with an adjuvant to stimulate antibody production. The compositions of the instant invention can be used in treating a disease state or can be used prophylactically. \n\n\n [0068] Another example of a vaccine that can be produced from the inventive compositions would be functionally equivalent or similar to Prevnar® (also known as Prevenar® in some countries). Prevnar® is a vaccine produced by Wyeth and marketed by Pfizer which protects humans (typically administered at 2, 4, 5, and 12-15 months of age) from certain pneumococcal bacteria that can cause serious diseases such as meningitis and bacteremia. \n\n\n [0069] Prevnar® is a heptavalent vaccine, meaning it has seven different carbohydrates from seven different serotypes. The seven serotypes (strains) of S. pneumoniae included in the vaccine (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) were the strains that most commonly caused these serious diseases in children prior to the introduction of the vaccine. These carbohydrates, which can be derived from pneumococcus, are attached to a carrier protein to produce the vaccine. One application of the instant technology would be replace the carrier protein of the vaccine with a MNP of the present invention. In one embodiment, the same carbohydrates used in the commercial vaccine could be linked to the MNP. In practice, different carbohydrates could easily be attached to different MNP sequences. Using the instant MNPs, seven, or even more, different carbohydrates could be attached to the MNP if desired to increase the number of strains represented in the vaccine. \n\n\n [0070] Other vaccines could similarly be made by appending agents that resemble a disease-causing microorganism such as a weakened or killed forms of the microbe or its toxins to the MNPs. Common vaccines include, but are not limited to, various strains of influenza \n\n vaccines, various strains of hepatitis vaccines, cholera vaccine, bubonic plague vaccine, polio vaccine, yellow fever vaccine, measles vaccine, rubella vaccine, tetanus vaccube, diphtheria, vaccine, mumps vaccine, typhoid vaccine, tuberculosis vaccine and rabies vaccine. Such vaccines could be produced by appending the appropriate agent to a MNP of the instant invention. Vaccines to other disease states can be produced by attaching the appropriate agent to a MNP. Additionally, vaccines to multiple conditions can be made by appending multiple agents to the MNP. \n\n\n [0071] Provided herein are methods of treating or inhibiting a disease state in a mammal by administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of one or more described MNPs having a substituent capable of binding a cell surface protein. In some embodiments the cell surface protein is a transmembrane protein, lipid-anchored protein, peripheral protein, a cellular receptor or an adhesion protein. In some aspects the mammal can be a rodent (mouse or rat), equine, feline, canine, or primate. In some embodiments, the described primate can be a human. \n\n\n [0072] In some embodiments, the described methods therapeutic methods directed to reducing metastasis in a mammal. In some embodiments these methods are carried out by administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of one or more described MNPs having a substituent capable of binding a cell surface protein. In particular embodiments the MNP administered to reduce metastasis is an MNP strand having 15 cyclo-RGD gamma substituents. In some aspects the mammal can be a rodent (mouse or rat), equine, feline, canine, or primate. In some embodiments, the described primate can be a mouse. In some \n\n\nembodiments, the described primate can be a human. \n\n\n [0073] Also described are methods for detecting the presence of a cell surface protein using the described MNPs. In some embodiments the described method can be carried out by administering to a subject a described MNP capable of binding to the cellular protein target of interest and detecting the administered MNP. To facilitate detection, in some embodiments the MNP may be labeled with a reporter molecule. For example, the MNP may be radio labeled, conjugated to a fluorescent label, biotinylated, conjugated to DOT A, DTPA, or consist of a radionuclide. Other acceptable labels are widely known within the art. In some aspects the subject may be a rodent (mouse or rat), equine, feline, canine, or primate. In some embodiments, the described primate can be a human. \n\n\n [0074] As used herein, the term \"reporter molecule\" is to be understood to mean any group which is detectable by analytical means in vitro and/ Or in vivo and which confers this property to his property to the conjugate. Some reporter molecules are a fluorescent molecule \n\n having fluorescence properties which are a function of the concentration of the molecule. Other reporter molecules have an absorbance spectra that can be monitored for detection. Numerous reporter molecules are known to those skilled in the art and are suitable for use with the present invention. One preferred reporter molecule is biotin. \n\n\n [0075] The term \"cross reactive groups\" refers to at least two groups that are capable of reacting to form a covalent bond linking the first and second PNAs. \n\n\n [0076] As used herein, the terms \"a\", \"an\", \"the\" and the like refer to both the singular and plural unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. \n\n\n [0077] Also as used herein, the description of one or more method steps does not preclude the presence of additional method steps before or after the combined recited steps. Additional steps may also be intervening steps to those described. In addition, it is understood that the lettering or order of process steps or ingredients is a convenient means for identifying discrete activities or ingredients and the recited lettering can be arranged in any reasonable sequence. \n\n\n [0078] Where a range of numbers is presented in the application, it is understood that the range includes all integers and fractions thereof between the stated range limits. A range of numbers expressly includes numbers less than the stated endpoints and those in-between the stated range. A range of from 1-3, for example, includes the integers one, two, and three as well as any fractions that reside between these integers. \n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL SECTION \n\n\n [0079] The following examples are intended to be illustrative and not limiting in nature. \n\n\n [0080] General: Proton nuclear magnetic resonances ( 1 H NMR) and 13 C nuclear \n\n\n 13 \n\n\nmagnetic resonances ( C NMR) were recorded in deuterated solvents on an iNOVA (500 MHz) and a Bruker (300 MHz) spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm, δ) relative to tetramethylsilane (δ 0.00) or residual proto solvent DMSO (δ, 2.50). 1H NMR splitting patterns are designated as singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), or doublet of doublets (dd). Splitting patterns that could not be interpreted or easily visualized are designated as multiplet (m). \n\n\n Electrospray mass spectra (ESI-MS) were obtained using a Micromass Quattro II Triple \n\n\n Quadrupole HPLC/MS/MS Mass Spectrometer.

Flash column chromatography was performed using a Biotage Flash 12+ \n\n apparatus on Biotage Si 25+M columns. Solvent mixtures used for TLC and flash column chromatography are reported in v/v ratios. Unless otherwise noted, all commercially available reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. \n\n\nBocLys(Cbz)-OH, and EDC were purchased from Advanced ChemTech. Thymine acetic acid (T-CH\n2\n-C0\n2\nH) was purchased from Aldrich. CCbz-CH\n2\n-C0\n2\nH and ACbz-CH\n2\n-C0\n2\nH were synthesized by PolyOrg Inc. DMF, dichloromethane, and THF were passed through activated alumina on a solvent purification system made by Glass Contour.

Glassware was dried in an oven at 180 °C for at least 2 hours prior to use. \n\n\nExample 1: Synthesis and Characterization of PNA conjugates. \n\n\n [0081] A solution of gamma-amino side chain peptide nucleic acid (γ-ΡΝΑ, 1.5 μιηοΐ), 3,4-diethoxy-3-cyclobutene-l,2-dione (45 μιηοΐ, 30 equiv), triethylamine (90 μιηοΐ, 60 equiv), 500 μΐ. of anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and 250 μΐ. of absolute ethanol was mixed for 3 hour. The solution was concentrated and the residue was washed with diethyl ether (3x 1.0 ml), and dried under vacuum to get squaric acid-conjugated PNA intermediate as a white solid. The above PNA intermediate was added to a solution of amino group-bearing RGD or carbohydrate monomer (30 μιηοΐ, 20 equiv), triethylamine (45 μιηοΐ, 30 equiv) in 500 μΐ. of anhydrous DMSO and 250 μΐ\n^\n of absolute ethanol. After 18 hours of shaking, the solution was concentrated. The residue was purified by reversed-phase HPLC to obtain the final conjugate product (57%~90% yield over two steps) as a white solid. \n\n\n [0082] Reverse-phase HPLC experiments were conducted with 19 x 150 mm Waters C8 reverse phase column using a Agilent HPLC. The typical flow rate was 12 mL/min. HPLC buffers consisted of 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile. \n\n\n\n\nTable 1. Mass spectrometry results of some PNA conjugates.

The solution was heated to 92 °C and hold for 5 min, and then slowly cooled down to 25 °C over a period of 2 h. \n\n\nExample 3: Variation of Tm with Addition of Gamma-substituents \n\n\n [0084] Various PNAs with gamma-substituents are depicted in Figure 14. The Tm values for these compositions were measured and addition of the sidechains caused Tm to increase. PNAs were made by standard methods. See, Englund, E. A.; Appella, D. H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2007, 46, 1414. \n\n\nExample 4: IC\n50\n Data— Cell Adhesion Assay \n\n\n [0085] Figure 15 and Table 2 show IC\n50\n data for various multivalent constructs. Multi 1 indicates one PNA construct associated with the DNA. Multi 2 indicates two PNA construct associated with the DNA and so on. Constructs were synthesized by standard methods and are depicted in Figure 15. In the constructs depicted herein, the designator in parentheses (T5, for example) represents the number of thymine bases in the DNA sequence that is inserted to create a spacer between adjacent PNA binding portions of the DNA. TO represents the absence of any spacer thymine bases. The number of thymine bases can vary widely (as illustrated in Table 3) and can be used to optimize the spacing between ligands displayed from an MNP. \n\n Table 2.

Incorporation of Quadruplex-Forming Structures into an Quadruplex- Forming Structures for Inhibition of Viral Attachment to Host Cells \n\n\n [0089] MNPs of the instant invention can be utilized for the incorporation of such molecules into quadruplex-forming structures for inhibition of viral attachment to host cells. Quadruplex-forming oligonucleotides have potent activity for inhibiting the attachment of HIV to host cells (the molecule zintevir is one example, see Urata, H. et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004, 31, 55). Zintevir is a single-stranded oligonucleotide derivative that adopts a quadruplex structure. PNA is known to form quadruplex structures, and the most stable quadruplexes involve a combination of PNA and DNA. In our invention, MNP becomes part of a quadruplex that inhibits viral entry. Various sidechains of the MNP can be utilized and optimized for the activity needed for a particular viral agent. \n\n\nExample 9. Inhibition of Cancer Metastasis In Vivo with an RGD-Conjugated MNP. \n\n\n [0090] Experiments were conducted to assess the ability of an RGD conjugated PNA to inhibit metastasis of cancer in vivo. B16F10 mouse melanoma cells were detached from culture flask and resuspended in serum-free RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 0.1% BSA at a concentration of 5x10\n6\n cells/ml. Cyclo-RGD or RGD-conjugated PNA complexes (MNP D5P3) were then mixed with cells and 0.2 ml aliquots containing 2 mg of cyclo-RGD, 100 μg of MNP D5P3, or PBS (negative control). Suspensions containing 5x10\n5\n cells were injected slowly into the lateral tail vein of 8-10 week old female C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Fourteen days later the animals were euthanized with CO\n2\n and their lungs were excised and fixed in Bouin's solution (SIGMA). The number of surface melanoma colonies was counted visually (Figure 20). Lung localized tumor foci were significantly reduced in mice injected with MNP D5P3 compared to cyclo-RGD or PBS (Figure 21)."
