The government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n Instability of gene-specific microsatellite and minisatellite repetitive sequences, leading to an increase in length of the repetitive sequences in the satellite, is associated with about 35 human genetic disorders. The causative gene for Huntington's disease, HD, is located on chromosome 4. Huntington's disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. When the gene has more than 35 CAG trinucleotide repeats coding for a polyglutamine stretch, the number of repeats can expand in successive generations. Because of the progressive increase in length of the repeats, the disease tends to increase in severity and presents at an earlier age in successive generations, a process called anticipation. The product of the HD gene is the 348 kDa cytoplasmic protein huntingtin. Huntingtin has a characteristic sequence of fewer than 40 glutamine amino acid residues in the normal form; the mutated huntingtin causing the disease has more than 40 residues. The continuous expression of mutant huntingtin molecules in neuronal cells results in the formation of large protein deposits which eventually give rise to cell \n\n death, especially in the frontal lobes and the basal ganglia (mainly in the caudate nucleus). The severity of the disease is generally proportional to the number of extra residues. \n\n\n Unstable repeat units are also found in untranslated regions, such as in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) in the 3 ' UTR or in intronic sequences such as in myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2). The normal number of repeats is around 5 to 37 for DMPK, but increases to premutation and full disease state two to ten fold or more, to 50, 100 and sometimes 1000 or more repeat units. For DM2/ZNF9 increases to 10,000 or more repeats have been reported. \n\n\n(Geary and Pearson, Cytogenet. Genome Res. 100: 25-55, 2003). \n\n\n DM1 is the most common muscular dystrophy in adults and is an inherited, progressive, degenerative, multisystemic disorder o f predominantly skeletal muscle, heart and brain. DM1 is caused by expansion of an unstable trinucleotide (CTG)„ repeat in the 3 ' untranslated region o f the DMPK gene (myotonic dystrophy protein kinase) on human chromosome 19q (Brook et al, Cell, 1992). Type 2 myotonic dystrophy (DM2) is caused by a CCTG expansion in intron 1 o f the ZNF9 gene, (Liquori et al, Science 2001). In the case of myotonic dystrophy type 1, the nuclearcytoplasmic export of DMPK transcripts is blocked by the increased length of the repeats, which form hairpin-like secondary structures that accumulate in nuclear foci. DMPK transcripts bearing a long (CUG)„ tract can form hairpin-like structures that bind proteins of the muscleblind family and subsequently aggregate in ribonuclear foci in the nucleus. These nuclear inclusions are thought to sequester muscleblind proteins, and potentially other factors, which then become limiting to the cell. In DM2, accumulation of ZNF9 RNA carrying the (CCUG)\nn\n expanded repeat form similar foci. Since muscleblind proteins are splicing factors, their depletion results in a dramatic rearrangement in splicing of other transcripts, refered to as spliceopathy. \n\n\nTranscripts of many genes consequently become aberrantly spliced, for instance by inclusion of fetal exons, or exclusion of exons, resulting in non-functional proteins and impaired cell function. For DM1, the aberrant transcript that accumulates in the nucleus could be down regulated or fully removed. Even relatively small reductions of the aberrant transcript could release substantial and possibly sufficient amounts of sequestered cellular factors and thereby help to restore normal RNA processing and cellular metabolism for DM (Kanadia et al., PNAS 2006). \n\n SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention is drawn to chemically-modified oligomers that are complementary to, and capable of hybridizing within the repeat region of CAG, CUG, or CCUG nucleotide repeat-containing RNAs (NRRs). The chemically-modified oligonucleotides of the present invention are useful in the selective disruption of the deleterious effects of mutant NRRs to treat diseases, without affecting the normal function of the wild-type allele. The chemically-modified oligonucleotides described herein that target triplet CAG or CUG or quartet CCUG repeat sequences can incorporate one or more of the following criteria: (i) the oligonucleotide should have sufficient affinity toward the repeat expansion portion of the NRR, (ii) the oligonucleotide drug design motif (i.e., the pattern of nucleoside modifications incorporated into the antisense oligonucleotide) should minimizethe antisense oligonucleotides' propensity to form stable self complementary structures, or (iii) the oligonucleotides should be stable to both exo- and endonucleases. The chemically-modified oligonucleotides of the present invention are useful in the preferential lowering of, or the preferential inhibition of the function of, mutant versus wild- type forms of CAG, CUG, or CCUG repeat containing RNAs. \n\n\n In an embodiment of the invention are provided chemically-modified oligonucleotides 17 to 22 nucleobases in length comprising a nucleobase sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 \n\n\n[TGCTGCTGCTGCTGC] which is 100% complementary within a repeat region of a CAG nucleotide repeat containing RNA, wherein: each T is independently a uridine or thymidine nucleoside, or a nucleoside containing a uracil or thymine base or analogue thereof, and comprising an independently selected high-affinity sugar modification; each non-terminal G is a guanosine nucleoside, or a nucleoside containing a guanine or guanine analogue base, comprising a 2'-deoxyribose sugar; each non-terminal C is a cytidine nucleoside, or a nucleoside containing a cytosine or cytosine analogue base (e.g., a 5-methylcytosine), comprising a 2'- deoxyribose sugar; and one or both of the 5' or 3' terminmal nucleosides comprises one or more nuclease-resistant modifications.

These NRRs are also referred to in the art as \n\n \"gain-of-function RNAs\" that gain the ability to sequester hnRNPs and impair the normal action of RNA processing in the nucleus (see Cooper, T. (2009) Cell 136, 777-793; O'Rourke, JR (2009) J Biol. Chem. 284 (12), 7419-7423), which are herein incorporated by reference in the entirety. Several disease states are associated with NRRs, some of said diseases only occurring where a threshold number of repeats are contained within the NRR. For instance, one disease state might be caused by 50-200 repeats in a particular gene, where a different disease or severity is caused by a different number of repeats >400 in the same gene. Some mutations that cause NRRs can be heterozygous and therefore some copies of the gene can be functional and as a result, there is a need to interfere with the mutant NRR without affecting the wild type copy of the gene.

Nucleosides include, but are not limited to, naturally occurring nucleosides (as found in DNA and RNA), abasic nucleosides, modified nucleosides, and sugar-modified nucleosides. Nucleosides may be modified with any of a variety of substituents. \n\n\n As used herein, \"sugar moiety\" means a natural (furanosyl), a modified sugar moiety or a sugar surrogate. \n\n\n As used herein, \"modified sugar moiety\" means a chemically-modified furanosyl sugar or a non-furanosyl sugar moiety. Also, embraced by this term are furanosyl sugar analogs and derivatives including bicyclic sugars, tetrahydropyrans, morpholinos, 2 '-modified sugars, 4'- modified sugars, 5'-modified sugars, and 4'-subsituted sugars. \n\n\n As used herein, \"sugar-modified nucleoside\" means a nucleoside comprising a modified sugar moiety. \n\n\n As used herein the term \"sugar surrogate\" refers to a structure that is capable of replacing the furanose ring of a naturally occurring nucleoside. In certain embodiments, sugar surrogates are non-furanose (or 4'-substituted furanose) rings or ring systems or open systems. Such structures include simple changes relative to the natural furanose ring, such as a six membered ring or may be more complicated as is the case with the non-ring system used in peptide nucleic acid. Sugar surrogates includes without limitation morpholinos and cyclohexenyls and cyclohexitols. In most nucleosides having a sugar surrogate group the heterocyclic base moiety is generally maintained to permit hybridization. \n\n\n As used herein, \"nucleotide\" refers to a nucleoside further comprising a modified or unmodified phosphate linking group or a non-phosphate internucleoside linkage. \n\n As used herein, \"linked nucleosides\" may or may not be linked by phosphate linkages and thus includes \"linked nucleotides.\" \n\n\n As used herein, \"nucleobase\" refers to the heterocyclic base portion of a nucleoside. Nucleobases may be naturally occurring or may be modified and therefore include, but are not limited to adenine, cytosine, guanine, uracil, thymidine and analogues thereof such as 5- methylcytosine. In certain embodiments, a nucleobase may comprise any atom or group of atoms capable of hydrogen bonding to a base of another nucleic acid. \n\n\n As used herein, \"modified nucleoside\" refers to a nucleoside comprising at least one modification compared to naturally occurring RNA or DNA nucleosides. Such modification may be at the sugar moiety and/or at the nucleobases. \n\n\n As used herein, \"T\nm\n\" means melting temperature which is the temperature at which the two strands of a duplex nucleic acid separate. T\nm\n is often used as a measure of duplex stability or the binding affinity of an antisense compound toward a complementary RNA molecule. \n\n\n As used herein, a \"high-affinity sugar modification\" is a modified sugar moiety which when it is included in a nucleoside and said nucleoside is incorporated into an antisense oligonucleotide, the stability (as measured by T\nm\n) of said antisense oligonucleotide: RNA duplex is increased as compared to the stability of a DNA:RNA duplex. \n\n\n As used herein, a \"high-affinity sugar-modified nucleoside\" is a nucleoside comprising a modified sugar moiety that when said nucleoside is incorporated into an antisense compound, the binding affinity (as measured by T\nm\n) of said antisense compound toward a complementary RNA molecule is increased. In certain embodiments of the invention at least one of said sugar- modified high-affinity nucleosides confers a AT\nm\n of at least 1 to 4 degrees per nucleoside against a complementary RNA as determined in accordance with the methodology described in Freier et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1997, 25, 4429-4443, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. In another aspect, at least one of the high-affinity sugar modifications confers about 2 or more, 3 or more, or 4 or more degrees per modification. In the context of the present invention, examples of sugar-modified high affinity nucleosides include, but are not limited to, (i) certain 2 '-modified nucleosides, including 2 '-substituted and 4' to 2' bicyclic nucleosides, and (ii) certain other non-ribofuranosyl nucleosides which provide a per modification increase in binding affinity such as modified tetrahydropyran and tricycloDNA nucleosides. For other modifications \n\n that are sugar-modified high-affinity nucleosides see Freier et al, Nucleic Acids Res., 1997, 25, 4429-4443. \n\n\n As used herein, a \"nuclease resistant modification\" means a sugar modification or modified internucleoside linkage which, when incorporated into an oligonucleotide, makes said oligonucleotide more stable to degradation under cellular nucleases (e.g. exo- or endo- nucleases). Examples of nuclease resistant modifications include, but are not limited to, phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages, bicyclic sugar modifications, 2'-modified \n\n\nnucleotides, or neutral internucleoside linkages. \n\n\n As used herein, \"bicyclic nucleosides\" refer to modified nucleosides comprising a bicyclic sugar moiety. Examples of bicyclic nucleosides include without limitation nucleosides comprising a bridge between the 4' and the 2' ribosyl ring atoms. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds provided herein include one or more bicyclic nucleosides wherein the bridge comprises a 4' to 2' bicyclic nucleoside.

Any such step may include values of zero. \n\n\n As used herein, \"target nucleic acid\" refers to any nucleic acid molecule the expression, amount, or activity of which is capable of being modulated by an antisense compound. In certain embodiments, the target nucleic acid is DNA or RNA. In certain embodiments, the target RNA is mRNA, pre-mRNA, non-coding RNA, pri-microRNA, pre-microRNA, mature microRNA, promoter-directed RNA, or natural antisense transcripts.

In certain embodiments, complementary nucleobase refers to a nucleobase of an antisense compound that is capable of base pairing with a nucleobase of its target nucleic acid. For example, if a nucleobase at a certain position of an antisense compound is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleobase at a certain position of a target nucleic acid, then the position of hydrogen bonding between the oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid is considered to be complementary at that nucleobase pair. Nucleobases comprising certain modifications may maintain the ability to pair with a counterpart nucleobase and thus, are still capable of nucleobase complementarity. \n\n\n As used herein, \"non-complementary\" \" in reference to nucleobases refers to a pair of nucleobases that do not form hydrogen bonds with one another or otherwise support \n\n\nhybridization. \n\n\n As used herein, \"complementary\" in reference to linked nucleosides, oligonucleotides, or nucleic acids, refers to the capacity of an oligomeric compound to hybridize to another oligomeric compound or nucleic acid through nucleobase complementarity. In certain embodiments, an antisense compound and its target are complementary to each other when a sufficient number of corresponding positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleobases that can bond with each other to allow stable association between the antisense compound and the target. One skilled in the art recognizes that the inclusion of mismatches is possible without eliminating the ability of the oligomeric compounds to remain in association. Therefore, \n\n described herein are antisense compounds that may comprise up to about 20% nucleotides that are mismatched (i.e., are not nucleobase complementary to the corresponding nucleotides of the target). Preferably the antisense compounds contain no more than about 15%, more preferably not more than about 10%, most preferably not more than 5% or no mismatches. The remaining nucleotides are nucleobase complementary or otherwise do not disrupt hybridization (e.g., universal bases).

While not limited to a particular mechanism, the most common mechanism of pairing involves hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleoside or nucleotide bases (nucleobases). For example, the natural base adenine is nucleobase complementary to the natural nucleobases thymidine and uracil which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. The natural base guanine is nucleobase \n\n\ncomplementary to the natural bases cytosine and 5-methylcytosine. Hybridization can occur under varying circumstances. \n\n\n As used herein, \"specifically hybridizes\" refers to the ability of an oligomeric compound to hybridize to one nucleic acid site with greater affinity than it hybridizes to another nucleic acid site. In certain embodiments, an antisense oligonucleotide specifically hybridizes to more than one target site. \n\n\n As used herein, \"overall identity\" refers to the nucleobase identity of an oligomeric compound relative to a particular nucleic acid or portion thereof, over the length of the oligomeric compound. \n\n\n As used herein, \"modulation\" refers to a perturbation of amount or quality of a function or activity when compared to the function or activity prior to modulation. For example, modulation includes the change, either an increase (stimulation or induction) or a decrease (inhibition or reduction) in gene expression. As a further example, modulation of expression can include perturbing splice site selection of pre-mRNA processing, resulting in a change in the amount of a particular splice-variant present compared to conditions that were not perturbed. As \n\n a further example, modulation includes perturbing translation of a protein. \n\n\n As used herein, \"motif refers to a pattern of modifications in an oligomeric compound or a region thereof. Motifs may be defined by modifications at certain nucleosides and/or at certain linking groups of an oligomeric compound. \n\n\n As used herein, \"nucleoside motif refers to a pattern of nucleoside modifications in an oligomeric compound or a region thereof.

The nucleosides of such an oligomeric compound may be modified or unmodified. Unless otherwise indicated, motifs herein describing only linkages are intended to be linkage motifs. Thus, in such instances, the nucleosides are not limited. \n\n\n As used herein, \"the same modifications\" refer to modifications relative to naturally occurring molecules that are the same as one another, including absence of modifications. Thus, for example, two unmodified DNA nucleoside have \"the same modification,\" even though the DNA nucleoside is unmodified. \n\n\n As used herein, \"type of modification\" in reference to a nucleoside or a nucleoside of a \"type\" refers to the modification of a nucleoside and includes modified and unmodified nucleosides.

Certain modified nucleobases are disclosed in, for example, Swayze, E.E. and Bhat, B., The Medicinal Chemistry of Oligonucleotides in ANTISENSE DRUG TECHNOLOGY, Chapter 6, pages 143-182 (Crooke, S ., ed., 2008); U.S. Patent No. 3,687,808, those disclosed in The Concise Encyclopedia Of Polymer Science And Engineering, pages 858- 859, Kroschwitz, J.I., ed. John Wiley & Sons, 1990, those disclosed by Englisch et al., \n\n\nAngewandte Chemie, International Edition, 1991 , 30, 613, and those disclosed by Sanghvi, Y.S., \n\n Chapter 15, Antisense Research and Applications, pages 289-302, Crooke, S.T. and Lebleu, B. , ed., CRC Press, 1993. Certain of these nucleobases are particularly useful for increasing the binding affinity of the oligomeric compounds of the invention. These include 5-substituted pyrimidines, 6-azapyrimidines and N-2, N-6 and 0-6 substituted purines, including 2 \n\n\naminopropyladenine, 5-propynyluracil and 5-propynylcytosine. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, nucleobases comprise polycyclic heterocyclic compounds in place of one or more heterocyclic base moieties of a nucleobase. A number of tricyclic heterocyclic compounds have been previously reported. These compounds are routinely used in antisense applications to increase the binding properties of the modified strand to a target strand. The most studied modifications are targeted to guanosines hence they have been termed G- clamps or cytidine analogs. \n\n\n Representative cytosine analogs that make 3 hydrogen bonds with a guanosine in a second strand include l,3-diazaphenoxazine-2-one (Kurchavov, et al, Nucleosides and \n\n\nNucleotides, 1997, 16, 1837-1846), l,3-diazaphenothiazine-2-one (Lin, K.-Y.; Jones, R. J.; Matteucci, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 3873-3874) and 6,7,8,9-tetrafluoro-l,3- diazaphenoxazine-2-one (Wang, J.; Lin, K.-Y., Matteucci, M. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998, 39, 8385- 8388). When incorporated into oligonucleotides, these base modifications have been shown to hybridize with complementary guanine and the latter was also shown to hybridize with adenine and to enhance helical thermal stability by extended stacking interactions (also see U.S. Patent Application Publication 20030207804 and U.S. Patent Application Publication 20030175906, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). \n\n\n Helix-stabilizing properties have been observed when a cytosine analog/substitute has an aminoethoxy moiety attached to the rigid l,3-diazaphenoxazine-2-one scaffold (Lin, K.-Y.; Matteucci, M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998, 120, 8531-8532). Binding studies demonstrated that a single incorporation could enhance the binding affinity of a model oligonucleotide to its complementary target DNA or RNA with a AT\nm\n of up to 18° relative to 5-methyl cytosine (dC5\nme\n), which is the highest known affinity enhancement for a single modification. On the other hand, the gain in helical stability does not compromise the specificity of the \n\n\noligonucleotides. The T\nm\n data indicate an even greater discrimination between the perfect match and mismatched sequences compared to dC5\nme\n. It was suggested that the tethered amino group \n\n serves as an additional hydrogen bond donor to interact with the Hoogsteen face, namely the 06, of a complementary guanine thereby forming 4 hydrogen bonds. This means that the increased affinity of G-clamp is mediated by the combination of extended base stacking and additional specific hydrogen bonding. \n\n\n Tricyclic heterocyclic compounds and methods of using them that are amenable to the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,028,183, and U.S. Patent 6,007,992, the contents of both are incorporated herein in their entirety. \n\n\n The enhanced binding affinity of the phenoxazine derivatives together with their sequence specificity makes them valuable nucleobase analogs for the development of more potent antisense-based drugs. The activity enhancement was even more pronounced in case of G-clamp, as a single substitution was shown to significantly improve the in vitro potency of a 20mer 2'-deoxyphosphorothioate oligonucleotides (Flanagan, W. M.; Wolf, J.J.; Olson, P.; \n\n\nGrant, D.; Lin, K.-Y.; Wagner, R. W.; Matteucci, M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1999, 96, 3513-3518). \n\n\n Modified polycyclic heterocyclic compounds useful as heterocyclic bases are disclosed in but not limited to, the above noted U.S. 3,687,808, as well as U.S.: 4,845,205; 5,130,302;\n\n\n5,134,066; 5,175,273; 5,367,066; 5,432,272; 5,434,257; 5,457,187; 5,459,255; 5,484,908; \n\n\n 5,502,177; 5,525,711; 5,552,540; 5,587,469; 5,594,121, 5,596,091; 5,614,617; 5,645,985; \n\n\n 5,646,269; 5,750,692; 5,830,653; 5,763,588; 6,005,096; and 5,681,941, and U.S. Patent \n\n\nApplication Publication 20030158403, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n\n\nSugar-Modified Nucleosides \n\n\n RNA duplexes exist in what has been termed \"A Form\" geometry while DNA duplexes exist in \"B Form\" geometry. In general, RNArRNA duplexes are more stable, or have higher melting temperatures (T\nm\n) than DNA:DNA duplexes (Sanger et al, Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure, 1984, Springer-Verlag; New York, NY.; Lesnik et al, Biochemistry, 1995, 34, 10807- 10815; Conte et al, Nucleic Acids Res., 1997, 25, 2627-2634). The increased stability of RNA has been attributed to several structural features, most notably the improved base stacking \n\n interactions that result from an A-form geometry (Searle et al, Nucleic Acids Res., 1993, 21, 2051-2056). The presence of the 2' hydroxyl in RNA biases the sugar toward a C3' endo pucker, i.e., also designated as Northern pucker, which causes the duplex to favor the A-form geometry. In addition, the 2' hydroxyl groups of RNA can form a network of water mediated hydrogen bonds that help stabilize the RNA duplex (Egli et al, Biochemistry, 1996, 35, 8489-8494). On the other hand, deoxy nucleic acids prefer a C2' endo sugar pucker, i.e., also known as Southern pucker, which is thought to impart a less stable B-form geometry (Sanger, W. (1984) Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure, Springer-Verlag, New York, NY). \n\n\n The relative ability of a chemically-modified oligomeric compound to bind to comple- mentary nucleic acid strands, as compared to natural oligonucleotides, is measured by obtaining the melting temperature of a hybridization complex of said chemically-modified oligomeric compound with its complementary unmodified target nucleic acid. The melting temperature (T\nm\n), a characteristic physical property of double helixes, denotes the temperature in degrees centigrade at which 50% helical versus coiled (unhybridized) forms are present. T\nm\n (also commonly referred to as binding affinity) is measured by using the UV spectrum to determine the formation and breakdown (melting) of hybridization. Base stacking, which occurs during hybridization, is accompanied by a reduction in UV absorption (hypochromicity). Consequently a reduction in UV absorption indicates a higher T\nm\n. \n\n\n It is known in the art that the relative duplex stability of an antisense compound:RNA target duplex can be modulated through incorporation of chemically-modified nucleosides into the antisense compound. Sugar-modifed nucleosides have provided the most efficient means of modulating the T\nm\n of an antisense compound with its target RNA. Sugar-modified nucleosides that increase the population of or lock the sugar in the C3 '-endo (Northern, RNA-like sugar pucker) configuration have predominantly provided a per modification T\nm\n increase for antisense compounds toward a complementary RNA target. Sugar-modified nucleosides that increase the population of or lock the sugar in the C2'-endo (Southern, DNA-like sugar pucker) configuration predominantly provide a per modification Tm decrease for antisense compounds toward a complementary RNA target. The sugar pucker of a given sugar-modified nucleoside is not the only factor that dictates the ability of the nucleoside to increase or decrease an antisense compound's T\nm\n toward complementary RNA. For example, the sugar-modified nucleoside tricycloDNA is predominantly in the CI' -endo conformation, however it imparts a 1.9 to 3° C \n\n per modification increase in T\nm\n toward a complementary R A. Another example of a sugar- modified high-affinity nucleoside that does not adopt the CV-endo conformation is a-L-LNA (described in more detail herein). \n\n\nCertain oligonucleotides \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the present invention provides modified oligonucleotides. In certain embodiments, modified oligonucleotides of the present invention comprise modified nucleosides. In certain embodiments, modified oligonucleotides of the present invention comprise modified internucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, modified oligonucleotides of the present invention comprise modified nucleosides and modified internucleoside linkages. \n\n\n In certain embodiments, the invention provides mutant selective compounds, which have a greater effect on a mutant nucleic acid than on the corresponding wild-type nucleic acid. In certain embodiment, the effect of a mutant selective compound on the mutant nucleic acid is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, or 100 times greater than the effect of the mutant selective compound on the corresponding wild-type nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, such selectivity results from greater affinity of the mutant selective compound for the mutant nucleic acid than for the corresponding wild type nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, selectivity results from a difference in the structure of the mutant compared to the wild-type nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, selectivity results from differences in processing or sub-cellular distribution of the mutant and wild-type nucleic acids. In certain embodiments, some selectivity may be attributable to the presence of additional target sites in a mutant nucleic acid compared to the wild-type nucleic acid. For example, in certain embodiments, a target mutant allele comprises an expanded repeat region comprising additional copies of a target sequence, while the wild-type allele has fewer copies of the repeat and, thus, fewer sites for hybridization of an antisense compound targeting the repeat region. In certain embodiments, a mutant selective compound has selectivity equal to or greater than the selectivity predicted by the increased number of target sites. In certain embodiments, a mutant selective compound has selectivity greater than the selectivity predicted by the increased number of target sites. In certain embodiments, the ratio of inhibition of a mutant allele to a wild type allele is equal to or greater than the ratio of the number of repeats in the mutant allele to the wild type allele. In certain embodiments, the ratio of inhibition \n\n of a mutant allele to a wild type allele is greater than the ratio of the number of repeats in the mutant allele to the wild type allele. \n\n\nCertain Intemucleoside Linkages \n\n\n In such embodiments, nucleosides may be linked together using any intemucleoside linkage. The two main classes of intemucleoside linking groups are defined by the presence or absence of a phosphorus atom. Representative phosphorus containing intemucleoside linkages include, but are not limited to, phosphodiesters (P=0), phosphotriesters, methylphosphonates, phosphoramidate, and phosphorothioates (P=S). Representative non-phosphorus containing intemucleoside linking groups include, but are not limited to, methylenemethylimino (-CH\n2\n- N(CH\n3\n)-0-CH\n2\n-), thiodiester (-O-C(O)-S-), thionocarbamate (-0-C(0)(NH)-S-); siloxane (-0- Si(H)2-0-); and N,N*-dimethylhydrazine (-CH\n2\n-N(CH\n3\n)-N(CH\n3\n)-). Oligonucleotides having non-phosphorus intemucleoside linking groups may be referred to as oligonucleosides. Modified linkages, compared to natural phosphodiester linkages, can be used to alter, typically increase, nuclease resistance of the oligomeric compound. In certain embodiments, intemucleoside linkages having a chiral atom can be prepared a racemic mixture, as separate enantomers. \n\n\nRepresentative chiral linkages include, but are not limited to, alkylphosphonates and \n\n\nphosphorothioates. Methods of preparation of phosphorous-containing and non-phosphorous- containing intemucleoside linkages are well known to those skilled in the art. \n\n\n The oligonucleotides described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and thus give rise to enantomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric configurations that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R) or (S), a or β such as for sugar anomers, or as (D) or (L) such as for amino acids et al. Included in the antisense compounds provided herein are all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. \n\n\n As used herein the term \"intemucleoside linkage\" or \"intemucleoside linking group\" is meant to include all manner of intemucleoside linking groups known in the art including but not limited to, phosphorus containing intemucleoside linking groups such as phosphodiester and phosphorothioate, and non-phosphorus containing intemucleoside linking groups such as formacetyl and methyleneimino. Intemucleoside linkages also includes neutral non-ionic \n\n intemucleoside linkages such as amide-3 (3'-CH\n2\n-C(=0)-N(H)-5'), amide-4 (3'-CH\n2\n-N(H)- C(=0)-5') and methylphosphonate wherein a phosphorus atom is not always present. \n\n\n As used herein the phrase \"neutral intemucleoside linkage\" is intended to include intemucleoside linkages that are non-ionic. Neutral intemucleoside linkages include without limitation, phosphotriesters, methylphosphonates, MMI (3'-CH\n2\n-N(CH\n3\n)-0-5'), amide-3 (3'-CH\n2\n- C(=0)-N(H)-5'), amide-4 (3'-CH\n2\n-N(H)-C(=0)-5'), formacetal (3'-0-CH\n2\n-0-5'), and \n\n\nthioformacetal (3'-S-CH\n2\n-0-5'). Further neutral intemucleoside linkages include nonionic linkages comprising siloxane (dialkylsiloxane), carboxylate ester, carboxamide, sulfide, sulfonate ester and amides (See for example: Carbohydrate Modifications in Antisense Research; Y.S. Sanghvi and P.D. Cook, Eds., ACS Symposium Series 580; Chapters 3 and 4, 40-65). \n\n\n Further neutral intemucleoside linkages include nonionic linkages comprising mixed N, O, S and C¾ component parts. \n\n\n The intemucleotide linkage found in native nucleic acids is a phosphodiester linkage. This linkage has not been the linkage of choice for synthetic oligonucleotides that are for the most part targeted to a portion of a nucleic acid such as mRNA because of stability problems e.g. degradation by nucleases. Preferred intemucleotide linkages or intemucleoside linkages as is the case for non phospate ester type linkages include, for example, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3'-alkylene phosphonates, 5 -alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates including 3 '-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, \n\n\nthionoalkylphosphotriesters, selenophosphates and boranophosphates having normal 3 '-5' linkages, 2 '-5' linked analogs of these, and those having inverted polarity wherein one or more intemucleotide linkages is a 3' to 3', 5' to 5' or 2' to 2' linkage. Preferred oligonucleotides having inverted polarity comprise a single 3' to 3' linkage at the 3'-most intemucleotide linkage i.e. a single inverted nucleoside residue which may be abasic (the nucleobase is missing or has a hydroxyl group in place thereof). Various salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also included. \n\n\n Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of the above phosphorus- containing linkages include, but are not limited to, U.S.: 3,687,808; 4,469,863; 4,476,301 ; \n\n5,023,243; 5,177,196; 5,188,897; 5,264,423; 5,276,019; 5,278,302; 5,286,717; 5,321,131; \n\n\n5,399,676; 5,405,939; 5,453,496; 5,455,233; 5,466,677; 5,476,925; 5,519,126; 5,536,821; \n\n\n5,541,306; 5,550,111; 5,563,253; 5,571,799; 5,587,361; 5,194,599; 5,565,555; 5,527,899; \n\n\n5,721,218; 5,672,697 and 5,625,050, certain of which are commonly owned with this application, and each of which is herein incorporated by reference. \n\n\n Preferred modified intemucleoside linkages that do not include a phosphorus atom therein include short chain alkyl or cycloalkyl intemucleoside linkages, mixed heteroatom and alkyl or cycloalkyl intemucleoside linkages, or one or more short chain heteroatomic or heterocyclic intemucleoside linkages.

Each of the references recited in the present application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. \n\n\n Throughout herein below the following notations mean the following: 'L' = LNA; Έ' or 'k' = cEt; italicized bases have 2'-0-methoxyethyl ribose modifications; 'd' = deoxyribose; 's' = phosphorothioate; T = cLNA or carbacyclic-LNA (except Table 17 where Ί' = LNA); and mC = 5-methylcytosine. Example 1: Effect of LNA-modified oligonucleotides, targeting human huntingtin {htt) mRNA, on huntingtin (Htt) protein \n\n\n Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the CAG repeat sequence of mutant huntingtin mRNA having LNA modifications were tested for their effect on Htt protein levels in vitro. The GM04281 fibroblast cell line (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, NJ, USA) containing 69 CAG repeats in the mutant htt allele and 17 CAG repeats in the wild-type allele, was used in this assay. Cells were cultured at a density of 60,000 cells per well in 6-well plates and were transfected using Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen, CA) with 100 nM antisense \n\n oligonucleotide for 24 hours. The wells were then aspirated and fresh culture medium was added to each well. \n\n\n After a post-transfection period of 4 days, the cells were harvested with trypsin solution (0.05% Trypsin-EDTA, Invitrogen) and lysed. The protein concentration in each sample was quantified with the micro-bicinchoninic acid (micro-BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific). An SDS- PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) was used to separate wild-type and mutant Htt proteins. Gels were run at 80 V for 15 min followed by 110 V for 5 hr. The electrophoresis apparatus was placed in an ice- water bath to prevent overheating. In parallel with analysis for Htt expression, portions of each protein lysate sample were also analyzed for β-actin expression by SDS-PAGE to ensure that there had been equal protein loading of each sample. \n\n\n After electrophoresis, proteins in the gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Extra; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). Primary antibodies specific for Htt \n\n\n(MAB2166, Chemicon) and β-actin (Sigma) protein were used at 1 : 10,000 dilutions. HRP- conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used for visualizing proteins using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). Protein bands were quantified using ImageJ software. The percentage inhibition was calculated relative to the negative control sample and presented in Table 1. The comparative percent inhibitions of the wild-type Htt protein and the mutant Htt protein are also presented. The T\nm\n value for each oligonucleotide, determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is also shown. \n\n\n The antisense oligonucleotides utilized in the assay are described in Table 1. The antisense oligonucleotides were obtained from either Sigma Aldrich or ISIS Pharmaceuticals. Of the antisense oligonucleotides presented in Table 1 , DNA22 is an unmodified oligonucleotide (DNA nucleosides with phosphodiester linkages). The negative control is a scrambled oligonucleotide sequence. The LNA modifications in each oligonucleotide are indicated by the subscript 'L' after each base. \n\n Table 1 \n\n\n Effect of LNA-modified antisense oligonucleotides on wild-type and mutant Htt prot \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral of the oligonucleotides reduced nucleotide repeat-containing RNA more than they reduced the corresponding wild-type. \n\n\n Example 2: in vitro dose-dependent effect of LNA-modified nucleotides on human Htt protein \n\n\n Antisense oligonucleotides from Example 1 (see Table 1 for description of chemical modifications) were tested at various doses in patient fibroblast cells. GM04281 fibroblast cells were plated at a density of 60,000 cells per well in 6-well plates and transfected using \n\n\n Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen, CA) reagent with increasing concentrations of \n\n antisense oligonucleotide for 24 hours, as specified in Tables 2 and 3. The cell samples were processed for protein analysis utilizing the procedure outlined in Example 1. \n\n\n Results are presented in Tables 2 and 3 as percent inhibition of wild-type and mutant Htt protein, relative to untreated control cells. The data presented is an average of several independent assays performed with each antisense oligonucleotide. As illustrated in Table 2, Htt mutant protein levels were reduced in a dose-dependent manner in antisense oligonucleotide treated cells. The IC\n50\n (nM) values for each oligonucleotide for inhibition of the mutant protein and wild-type protein is also shown and indicates that each oligonucleotide preferentially targets the mutant htt mRNA compared to the wild-type. The oligonucleotides listed in Table 3 demonstrate low in vitro potency and or little or no preferential lowering of the mutant mRNA compared to the wild-type. \n\n\n Table 2 \n\n\n Dose-dependent effect of LNA-modified oligonucleotides on wild-type versus mutant Htt protein \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3 \n\n\n Effect of LNA-modified oligonucleotides on wild-type versus mutant Htt protein \n\n\n \n\n mutant 12 8 3 37 7 0 >100 \n\n\n wild-type 0 4 6 4 6 3 >100\n\n\nLNA(T)+1 10 \n\n\n mutant 0 19 18 22 26 36 >100 wild-type 4 14 10 0 0 0 >100\n\n\nLNA(G)+1 10 \n\n\n mutant 0 27 28 6 0 0 >100 wild-type 3 6 0 0 0 22 >100\n\n\nLNA(C)+2 11 \n\n\n mutant 2 6 0 0 2 42 >100 wild-type 0 10 14 3 1 11 >100\n\n\nLNA(T)16 12 \n\n\n mutant 0 15 15 3 24 26 >100 wild-type 4 1 2 0 5 0 >100\n\n\nLNA(T)13 13 \n\n\n mutant 0 2 12 2 17 0 >100 wild-type 0 3 16 21 39 62 69.2\n\n\nLNA-gap 9 \n\n\n mutant 0 7 26 41 63 83 32.5 \n\n\nExample 3: Effect of chemically modified oligonucleotides, targeting human huntingtin (htt) mRNA, on huntingtin (Htt) protein \n\n\n Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the CAG repeat sequence of mutant huntingtin nucleic acid and with various chemical modifications were tested for their effects on Htt protein levels in vitro.

Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the CAG repeat sequence of mutant huntingtin nucleic acid and with various chemical modifications were tested for their effects on htt mRNA levels in vitro. GM04281 cells were cultured at a density of 60,000 cells per well in 6-well plates and transfected using Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen, CA) with 50 nM antisense oligonucleotide for 24 hours. The wells were then aspirated and fresh culture medium was added to each well. After a post-transfection period of 3 days, the cells were harvested with trypsin solution (0.05% Trypsin-EDTA, Invitrogen) and lysed. \n\n\n Total RNA from treated and untreated fibroblast cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Samples were then treated with DNase I (Worthington Biochemical Corp.) at 25°C for 10 min. Reverse transcription reactions were carried out using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. \n\n\nQuantitative PCR was performed on a BioRad CFX96 Real Time System using iTaq SYBR Green Supermix with ROX (Bio-rad). Data was normalized relative to GAPDH mRNA levels. Primer sequences specific for htt are as follows: forward primer, 5'-\n\n\nCGACAGCGAGTCAGTGAATG-3 ' (designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 15) and reverse primer, \n\n 5 ' - ACC ACTCTGGCTTC AC AAGG-3 ' (designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 16). Primers specific for GAPDH were obtained from Applied Biosystems. \n\n\n The results are presented in Table 10 and indicate the percent inhibition of htt mRNA compared to untreated cells. The results indicate that mRNA levels were unaffected by treatment with the antisense oligonucleotides. \n\n\n Table 10 \n\n\n Effect of antisense oligonucleotides targeting CAG repeats on htt mRNA levels \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8: Time-dependent effect of an LNA-modified antisense oligonucleotide, targeting mutant htt mRNA, on human huntingtin (Htt) protein levels \n\n\n The ISIS antisense oligonucleotide with LNA modifications at the thymine bases and which demonstrated significant selective inhibition of mutant huntingtin protein compared to wild-type protein (see Tables 1 and 2 for description of chemical modifications) was further studied. The time-dependent effect of this oligonucleotide was tested. GM04281 fibroblast cells were cultured at a density of 60,000 cells per well in 6-well plates and transfected using \n\n\n Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen, CA) with 100 nM antisense oligonucleotide \n\n for 24 hours. The cell samples were processed for protein analysis at 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, and 6 days post-transfection, utilizing the procedure outlined in Example 1. \n\n\n The results are presented in Table 11 and indicate the preferential time-dependent decrease in mutant huntingtin protein levels. The effect was observed to be optimal at day 3 post- transfection. \n\n\n Table 11 \n\n\n Time-dependent effect of LNA-modified ISIS antisense oligonucleotide on mutant Htt protein levels \n\n\n \n\n Example 9: Oligonucleotide selectivity of mutant huntingtin mRNA containing 41 or 44 repeat lengths \n\n\n Studies in Examples 1-8, describing oligonucleotide selectivity for the mutant allele versus the wild-type allele of the htt gene, were performed in the GM04281 fibroblast cell line, which contains 69 CAG repeats in the mutant htt allele. In order to determine whether the antisense oligonucleotides would selectively target mutant htt mRNA with shorter CAG repeats, two HD patient-derived fibroblast cell lines, GM04717 and GM04719, (Cornell Institute for Medical Research, NJ, USA), were utilized. The GM04717 fibroblast cell line contains 41 repeats on the mutant allele and 20 repeats on the wild-type allele. The GM04719 fibroblast cell line contains 44 repeats on the mutant allele and 15 repeats on the wild-type allele. \n\n\n Cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% C0\n2\n in MEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10%\n\n\nFBS (Sigma) and 0.5% MEM nonessential amino acids (Sigma). Cells were plated in 6-well dishes at 60,000 cells/well in supplemented MEM two days before transfection. Stock solutions \n\n of modified antisense oligonucleotides were heated at 65 °C for 5 minutes prior to use to dissolve any aggregation. Modified ASOs were transfected into cells at varying doses, described below in Tables 12 and 13, using Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Media was exchanged one day after transfection with fresh supplemented media. Cells were washed with PBS and harvested four days after transfection for protein analysis. \n\n\n Cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen) and lysed. The protein concentration in each sample was quantified with micro-bicinchoninic acid (micro-BCA) assay (Thermo Scientific). SDS-PAGE (separating gel: 5% acrylamide-bisacrylamide [50:1], 450 mM Tris-acetate pH 8.8; stacking gel: 4% acrylamide-bisacrylamide [50:1], 150 mM Tris-aceate pH 6.8) was used to separate wild-type and mutant HTT proteins. Gels were run at 30 mA per gel for 6-7 hours in Novex Tris-acetate SDS Running Buffer (Invitrogen). The electrophoresis apparatus was placed in a 15 °C water bath to prevent overheating. In parallel with analysis for HTT expression, samples were analyzed for β-actin expression by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide pre-cast gels; Bio-Rad) to ensure even loading of protein in all lanes. These gels were run at 80 V for 15 minutes followed by 100V for 1 hour in lxTGS buffer (Bio-Rad). \n\n\n After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to membrane (Hybond-C Extra; GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). Primary antibodies specific for HTT (MAB2166, Chemicon) and β- actin (Sigma) protein were obtained and used at 1:10,000 dilutions. HRP conjugate anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000, Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories) was used for visualizing proteins using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). Protein bands were quantified from autoradiographs using ImageJ Software. Percentage of inhibition was calculated as a relative value to control samples. \n\n\n Each data plot from dose response experiments for inhibition of HTT was fit to the following model equation: y = 100 (l-x\nm\n/(n\nm\n+x\nm\n)) using Prism 4.0(GraphPad), where y is percent expression of HTT protein and x is concentration of ASO. Both m and n are fitting parameters, where n is taken as the IC\n50\n value. The IC\n50\n values were calculated from individual dose responses fit to the above equation and then reported as the mean and standard error of the mean of three or more biological replicates. \n\n The antisense oligonucleotides tested were LNA (T) (described in Example 1) and cEt (described in Example 3). The results are presented in Tables 12 and 13. Results demonstrate that both the mutant and wild-type alleles are reduced in a dose-dependent manner. However, the mutant allele is reduced more significantly than the wild-type allele. \n\n\n The IC50 for each antisense oligonucleotide is presented in Table 14. The mutant allele is reduced three- to seven-fold more than the wild-type allele, demonstrating that the antisense oligonucleotide selectively reduces the mutant allele. This data indicates that allele-specific antisense oligonucleotides can discriminate between the wild-type allele and mutant allele of htt, even when the numbers of CAG repeats are 41 and 44 in number. \n\n\n Table 12 \n\n\n Dose dependent inhibition and allele-selectivity of antisense oligonucleotides in GM04717 fibroblasts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Table 13 \n\n\n Dose dependent inhibition and allele-selectivity of antisense oligonucleotides in GM04719 fibroblasts \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Table 14 \n\n\n and allele-selectivity of antisense oligonucleotides in GM04717 and GM04719 fibroblasts \n\n\n \n\n Example 10: Role of different transfection reagents in the efficacy of antisense oligonucleotides targeting the CAG repeat sequence of htt mRNA \n\n\n To test wheter the chemistries of the different antisense oligonucleotides affect the transfection efficiency of the oligonucleotides and, hence distort their efficacy to inhibit mutant htt mRNA, a side-by-side comparison of inhibition by the antisense oligonucleotides transfected with five different transfection reagents was performed. Transfection reagents Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, CA, USA), Oligofectamine™ (Invitrogen, CA, USA), TriFECTin (Integrated DNA Technologies, CA, USA), 7>iwsIT®-01igo (Mirus Bio LLC, WI, USA), and PepMute™ (Signagen Laboratories, MD, USA) were utilized in this study. \n\n\n The antisense oligonucleotides tested were LNA (T) (described in Example 1) and MOE\n\n\n(described in Example 4). A negative control LNA oligonucleotide and a positive control siRNA (siHdhl siRNA) were also included in the assay. The antisense oligonucleotides were transfected into GM04281 cell and protein analysis of htt was done in a procedure similar to that described in Example 1. The results are presented in Table 15, below and are expressed as percent inhibition compared to the negative control. \n\n\n As presented in Table 15 the LNA(T) oligonucleotide demonstrated potency and allele- specificity, regardless of the transfection reagent used. The performance of the all lipid-based transfection reagents (Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX, Oligofectamine™, TriFECTin, and \n\n\n7ra«sIT®-01igo) were therefore similar. In previous experiments, LNA(T) showed allele- selective inhibition while the MOE oligo demonstrated less inhibition and little or no selectivity. Using other transfection reagents, the MOE ASO showed allele-selectie inhibition. \n\n\n In case of the non-lipid peptide-based transfection reagent, PepMute™, it was observed that the MOE oligonucleotide, transfected into cells with this transfection reagent, demonstrated both potency and allele-specificity. Hence, the choice of transfection reagent may affect comparisons between oligonucleotide chemistries and may be the reason for an antisense oligonucleotide underperforming in a particular cellular assay. \n\n Table 15: \n\n\n Potency (% inhibition of hit mRNA) and allele-selectivity of antisense oligonucleotides with different transfection reagents \n\n\n \n\n Example 11: Effect of antisense oligonucleotides targeting CAG repeats of mutant hit in R6/2 mice via single intrastriatal bolus administration \n\n\n R6/2 mice were administered ISIS oligonucleotides as a single bolus to the right striatum for the purpose of testing the selectivity of the antisense oligonucleotides against mutant huntingtin protein expression in that tissue. The antisense oligonucleotides used in this study are presented in Table 16 and 17. In Table 16, the chemistry motifs are as shown in subscripts as 'k' = cEt and'd' = 2'-deoxyribose. All the cytosine residues are 5-methylcytosines. Each internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. In Table 17, the chemistry motifs are shown in subscripts as 'E'=cEt. All the cytosine residues are 5-methylcytosines. Each internucleoside linkage is a phosphorothioate linkage. \n\n\n Table 16 \n\n\n Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to mutant human htt mRNA \n\n\n \n\n Table 17 \n\n\n Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to mutant human htt mRNA \n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment and surgery A group of four 8-week old R6/2 mice were treated with ISIS 473814, delivered as a single bolus of 50 μg delivered in a volume of 2 μί, to the right striatum. One 8-week old R6/2 mice was treated with ISIS 473813, delivered as a single bolus of 50 μg delivered in a volume of 2 μΐ, to the right striatum. A control group of three 8-week old R6/2 mice were treated with PBS in a similar procedure. After 4 weeks, the mice were euthanized and striatal tissue was extracted. A pair of fine curved forceps was placed straight down into the brain just anterior to the hippocampus to make a transverse incision in the cortex and underlying tissues by blunt dissection. The tips of another pair of fine curved forceps were placed straight down along the midsaggital sinus midway between the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb to make a longitudinal incision, cutting the corpus callosum by blunt dissection. The first pair of forceps was then used to reflect back the resultant corner of cortex exposing the striatum and internal capsule, and then to dissect the internal capsule away from the striatum. The second set of forceps was placed such that the curved ends were on either side of the striatum and pressed down to isolate the tissue. The first set of forceps was used to pinch off the posterior end of the striatum and to remove the striatum from the brain. Protein analysis \n\n\n Tissues from the right striatum immediately above the injection site were processed for protein analysis in a procedure similar to that described in Example 1. The peptide band intensities were quantified using Adobe Photoshop software. The results are presented in Table 18 as percent inhibition of soluble human htt protein compared to a non-specific band control. The results indicate that both the ISIS oligonucleotides inhibited the accumulated levels of soluble human mutant huntingtin protein. \n\n Table 18 \n\n\n Effect of antisense inhibition on mutant human hit protein levels in R6/2 mice \n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12: Effect of antisense oligonucleotides targeting CAG repeats of mutant hit in R6/2 mice via intracerebrovascular (ICV) infusion \n\n\n R6/2 mice were administered ISIS oligonucleotides via ICV infusion to the right striatum for the purpose of testing the selectivity of ISIS 473814 against mutant huntingtin protein expression in that tissue. \n\n\n Treatment and surgery A group of five 7-week old R6/2 mice was administered ISIS 473814 at 75 μg/day delivered ICV with Alzet 2002 pumps at the rate of 0.5 μΙ-,/hr for 2 weeks. A control group of 4 -week old R6/2 mice was similarly treated with PBS. Alzet osmotic pumps (Model 2002) were assembled according to manufacturer's instructions. Pumps were filled with a solution containing the antisense oligonucleotide and incubated overnight at 37°C, 24 hours prior to implantation. Animals were anesthetized with 3% isofluorane and placed in a stereotactic frame. After sterilizing the surgical site, a midline incision was made over the skull, and a subcutaneous pocket was created over the back, in which a pre-filled osmotic pump was implanted. A small burr hole was made through the skull above the right lateral ventricle. A cannula, connected to the osmotic pump via a plastic catheter, was then placed in the ventricle and glued in place using Loctite adhesive. The incision was closed with sutures. Antisense oligonucleotide or PBS was infused for 14 days, after which animals were euthanized according to a humane protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Tissues from the right striatum immediately adjacent to the injection site were extracted for further analysis. \n\n\nProtein analysis \n\n\n Tissues from the right striatum immediately above the injection site were processed for protein analysis in a procedure similar to that described in Example 1. The peptide band intensities were quantified using Adobe Photoshop software. The results were expressed percent \n\n inhibition of soluble human htt protein compared to a GAPDH band. It was observed that ISIS 473814 inhibited the accumulated levels of soluble human mutant huntingtin protein by 30% compared to the PBS control. \n\n\nExample 13: Design of antisense oligonucleotides targeting CUG repeats \n\n\nAntisense oligonucleotides were designed targeting mRNA transcripts that contain multiple CUG repeats. The chemistry of these oligonucleotides as well as their sequence is shown in Tables 19 and 20. In Table 19, the symbols designated to the sugar type are shown after the base in subscript and are as follows: d = 2'-deoxyribose; k = (S)-cEt; and 1 = LNA (Locked Nucleic Acids). The heterocycle names are defined with standard symbols for adenine, cytosine, thymine and guanine, and 'mC for 5-methylcytosine. Linkers are shown after the sugar type in subscript and designated with the following symbol: s = thioate ester, also, phosphorothioate. In Table 20, the symbols designated to the sugar type are shown after the base in subscript and are as follows: E = (S)-cEt and L = LNA (Locked Nucleic Acids). The heterocycle names are defined with standard symbols for adenine, cytosine, thymine and guanine, and 'mC for 5- methylcytosine. Linkers are shown after the sugar type in subscript and designated with the following symbol: s = thioate ester, also, phosphorothioate. \n\n\n Table 19 \n\n\n Design of antisense oligonucleotides targeting CUG repeats \n\n\n \n\n Table 20 \n\n\n Design of antisense oligonucleotides targeting CUG repeats \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14: Effect of BNA-modified antisense oligonucleotides, targeting human ataxin-3 (aix3) mRNA, on Ataxin-3 (ATX3) protein \n\n\n Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the CAG repeat sequence of ataxin-3 mRNA and with BNA modifications were tested for their effect on ATX3 protein levels in vitro. The GM06151 fibroblast cell line (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, NJ, USA) containing 74 CAG repeats in the mutant atx3 allele and 24 CAG repeats in the wild-type allele, was utilized in this assay. The cells were maintained at 37°C and 5% C0\n2\n in MEM Eagle media (Sigma Corp.), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma Corp) and 0.5% MEM nonessential amino acids (Sigma Corp.). Cells were cultured at a density of 70,000 cells per well in 6-well plates two days prior to transfection. The BNA-modified antisense oligonucleotides were heated at 65°C for 5 min, then diluted to the appropriate concentration using PepMute transfection reagent (SignaGen, Ijamsville, MD), and then transfected at various doses to the cells, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 hrs, the media were removed and replaced with fresh supplemented MEM media. \n\n\n After a post-transfection period of 4 days, the cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad) and lysed. The protein concentration in each sample was quantified with the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). An SDS-PAGE gel (7.5% acrylamide pre-cast gels, Bio-Rad) was used to separate wild-type and mutant ATX3 proteins. The electrophoresis apparatus was placed in an ice-water bath to prevent overheating. In parallel \n\n with analysis for ATX3 expression, portions of each protein lysate sample were also analyzed for β-actin expression by SDS-PAGE to ensure that there had been equal protein loading of each sample. \n\n\n After electrophoresis, proteins in the gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with specific antibodies. Primary antibodies specific for ATX3 (MAB5360,\n\n\nChemicon) and β-actin (Sigma) protein were used at 1 : 10,000 dilutions. HRP-conjugated anti- mouse secondary antibody (1 : 10,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used for visualizing proteins using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo \n\n\n Scientific). Protein bands were quantified using ImageJ software (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U.S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ii/, 1997-2007). The dose- dependent inhibition of ATX3 protein levels is presented in Table 21 and table 22. The percentage inhibition was calculated relative to the negative control sample. The IC\n50\n of the wild-type ATX3 protein and the mutant ATX3 protein and the selectivity of the antisense oligonucleotides are presented in Table 21 and Table 22. \n\n\n The antisense oligonucleotides utilized in the assay are described in Table 21 and Table\n\n\n22. The antisense oligonucleotides were obtained from either Glen Research Corporation (Sterling, VA) or ISIS Pharmaceuticals. In Table 21, the carba-LNA-modified bases are denoted by subscript T and cET-modified bases are denoted by subscript Έ'. In Table 22, the cET- modified bases are denoted by subscript 'k'. \n\n\n Table 21 \n\n\n Effect of BNA-modified antisense oligonucleotides on wild-type and mutant ATX3 proteins \n\n\n \n\n Table 22 \n\n\n Effect of BNA-modified antisense oligonucleotides on wild-type and mutant ATX3 proteins \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 15: Antisense inhibition of human dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase (DMPK) mRNA by ISIS 473810 and ISIS 473811 \n\n\n ISIS 473810 and ISIS 473811 (see Tables 19 and 20 for description of chemical mofications) were tested for their effects on DMPK mRNA levels in vitro. Fibroblast cell lines established from DM patients, all containing a Bpm I restriction site polymorphism located within exon 10 of the mutant allele of the DMPK gene (Hamshere et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 94: 7394-7399, 1997), were utilized in this assay. Cells were cultured in normal growth media with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and were transfected for 5 days without transfection reagent with 500 nM antisense oligonucleotide. The wells were then aspirated and fresh culture medium was added to each well. \n\n\n One day post-transfection, the cells were harvested and RNA isolated using Trizol® reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Reverse transcription and PCR amplification reactions were conducted for DMPK mRNA, after which the cDNA was digested with Bpm I restriction enzyme. The digested samples were then run on a Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) gel and stained with SYBR green staining dye for 30 min for DNA band visualization. The presence of the Bpm I restriction polymorphism at only the mutant allele enabled the separation of the cDNA samples into two distinct bands of 152 base-pairs (wild-type allele) and 136 base-pairs (mutant allele). The separated DNA bands were quantified using arbitrary units and the density of the same is presented in Table 23. \n\n\n Table 23 \n\n\n Percent inhibition of DMPK wild-type allele and mutant allele RNA by antisense oligonucleotides"

Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is concerned isoxazole-imidazole derivatives having affinity and selectivity for GABA A α5 receptor binding site, their manufacture, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as medicaments. The active compounds of the present invention are useful as cognitive enhancer or for the treatment of cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, the present invention is concerned with aryl-isoxazol-4-yl-imidazole derivatives of formula I\n\n \n \n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n and R\n3\n are as described in claim 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReceptors for the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), are divided into two main classes: (1) GABA A receptors, which are members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily and (2) GABA B receptors, which are members of the G-protein linked receptor family. The GABA A receptor complex which is a membrane-bound heteropentameric protein polymer is composed principally of α, β and γ subunits.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPresently a total number of 21 subunits of the GABA A receptor have been cloned and sequenced. Three types of subunits (α, β and γ) are required for the construction of recombinant GABA A receptors which most closely mimic the biochemical, electrophysiological and pharmacological functions of native GABA A receptors obtained from mammalian brain cells. There is strong evidence that the benzodiazepine binding site lies between the α and γ subunits. Among the recombinant GABA A receptors, α1β2γ2 mimics many effects of the classical type-I BzR subtypes, whereas α2β2γ2, α3β2γ2 and α5β2γ2 ion channels are termed type-II BzR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been shown by \nMcNamara and Skelton in Psychobiology, 21:101-108\n that the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist β-CCM enhance spatial learning in the Morris watermaze. However, β-CCM and other conventional benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists are proconvulsant or convulsant which prevents their use as cognition enhancing agents in humans. In addition, these compounds are non-selective within the GABA A receptor subunits, whereas a GABA A α5 receptor partial or full inverse agonist which is relatively free of activity at GABA A α1 and/or α2 and/or α3 receptor binding sites can be used to provide a medicament which is useful for enhancing cognition with reduced or without proconvulsant activity. It is also possible to use GABA A α5 inverse agonists which are not free of activity at GABA A α1 and/or α2 and/or α3 receptor binding sites but which are functionally selective for α5 containing subunits. However, inverse agonists which are selective for GABA A α5 subunits and are relatively free of activity at GABA A α1, α2 and α3 receptor binding sites are preferred.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDocuments \n \nWO 2007/074078\n \n, \n \nWO 2007/074089\n \n and \n \nWO 2007/082806\n \n disclose compounds with activity at the GABA A α5 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nObjects of the present invention are compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, the preparation of the above mentioned compounds, medicaments containing them and their manufacture as well as the use of the above mentioned compounds in the control or prevention of illnesses, especially of illnesses and disorders of the kind referred to earlier or in the manufacture of corresponding medicaments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe most preferred indication in accordance with the present invention is Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following definitions of the general terms used in the present description apply irrespective of whether the terms in question appear alone or in combination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"alkyl\" denotes a saturated straight- or branched-chain group containing from 1 to 7 carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, \niso\n-butyl, \nsec\n-butyl, \ntert\n-butyl and the like.

The cell pellets were resuspended in Krebs-tris buffer and homogenized by polytron for ca. 15 sec on ice. Protein was measured (Bradford method, Bio-Rad) and aliquots of 1 mL were prepared and stored at -80 °C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadioligand binding assays were carried out in a volume of 200 mL (96-well plates) which contained 100 mL of cell memebranes, [3H]flumazenil at a concentration of 1 nM for α1, α2, α3 subunits and 0.5 nM for α5 subunits and the test compound in the range of 10-10\n-3\n x 10\n-6\n M. Nonspecific binding was defined by 10\n-5\n M diazepam and typically represented less than 5% of the total binding. Assays were incubated to equilibrium for 1 hour at 4 °C and harvested onto GF/C uni-filters (Packard) by filtration using a Packard harvester and washing with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris; pH 7.5). After drying, filter-retained radioactivity was detected by liquid scintillation counting. Ki values were calculated using Excel-Fit (Microsoft) and are the means of two determinations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the accompanying examples were tested in the above described assay, and the preferred compounds were found to possess a Ki value for displacement of [3H]flumazenil from α5 subunits of the rat GABA A receptor of 100 nM or less. Most preferred are compounds with a Ki (nM) < 35.
