Description\n\n\n\n\n Lactam-Bridged Melanocortin Receptor-Specific Peptides\n\n\nCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION\n\n\nThis application claims priority to and the benefit of the filing of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/184,940 entitled \"Lactam-Bridged Melanocortin Receptor-Specific Peptides\", filed June 8, 2009, and the specification and claims thereof are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nField of the Invention (Technical Field):\n\n\nThe present invention relates to lactam-bridged melanocortin receptor-specific cyclic peptides which may be used in the treatment of melanocortin receptor-mediated diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes. Description of Related Art:\n\n\nThe following discussion refers to a number of publications by author(s) and year of publication, and that due to recent publication dates certain publications are not to be considered as prior art vis-a-vis the present invention. Discussion of such publications herein is given for more complete background and is not to be construed as an admission that such publications are prior art for patentability determination purposes.\n\n\nA family of melanocortin receptor types and subtypes have been identified, including melanocortin-1 receptors (MC1-R) expressed on normal human melanocytes and melanoma cells, melanocortin-2 receptors (MC2-R) for ACTH (adrenocorticotropin) expressed in cells of the adrenal gland, melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 receptors (MC3-R and MC4-R) expressed primarily in cells in the hypothalamus, mid-brain and brainstem, and melanocortin-5 receptors (MC5-R), expressed in a wide distribution of peripheral tissues. MC1-R has been suggested to be associated with hair and skin pigmentation and inflammation, MC2-R is believed to mediate steroidogenesis, MC3-R has been suggested to be associated with energy homeostasis, food intake, and inflammation, MC4-R is believed to control feeding behavior, energy homeostasis, and sexual function (e.g. erectile function), and MC5-R has been suggested to be involved in the exocrine gland system.\n\n\nSignificant work has been done in determining the structure of melanocortin receptors, including both the nucleic acid sequences encoding for the receptors and the amino acid sequences constituting the receptors. MC4-R is a G protein-coupled, 7-transmembrane receptor that is believed to be expressed primarily in the brain. MC4-R inactivation has been shown to result in obesity (Hadley, 1999, Ann N Y Acad Sci, 885:1-\n\n\n21 ). Agouti-related protein (AgRP) is an endogeneous compound that has been suggested to be a MC antagonist or an inverse agonist on MC4-R. The α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is believed to be the principle endogenous MC4-R agonist.\n\n\nAlso peripherally located MC4-R receptors have been suggested to be involved in the control of energy homeostasis, and the role of MC4-R signalling in the vagus nerve and its relevance for treatment \n\n of obesity and diabetes is discussed by Gautron et al, The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 518:6-24 (2010).\n\n\nPeptides specific for MC4-R, and secondarily peptides specific for MC3-R, are believed to be useful in regulation of mammalian energy homeostasis, including use as agents for attenuating food intake and body weight gain. MC4-R agonist peptides are believed to be useful for treating sexual dysfunction, including male erectile dysfunction, and for decreasing food intake and body weight gain, such as for treatment of obesity. Such peptides may also be employed for decreasing voluntary ethanol consumption, treatment of drug addictions, and the like. MC4-R agonist peptides, as well as MC3-R agonist peptides, may further be employed for treatment of circulatory shock, ischemia, hemorrhagic shock, inflammatory diseases and related diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes. MC4-R antagonist peptides, by contrast, are believed to be useful for weight gain aid, such as for use in treatment of cachexia, sarcopenia, wasting syndrome or disease, and anorexia. Such peptides may also be employed for treatment of depression and related disorders. (Wikberg et al, Nature Reviews, Drug Discovery, 7, 307, (2008); Adan et al, British J. Pharm., 149, 815-827 (2006); Nogueiras et al, J. Clin., Invest, 117(11 ): 3475-3488 (2007); Maaser et al, Ann. N.Y. Acad. ScL, 1072, 123-134 (2006); Giuliani et al, British J.

Res., 29(6), 949-957 (2005)).\n\n\nMelanocortin receptor-specific cyclic peptides include cyclic α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\"α-MSH\") analog peptides such as Ac-Nle-cyc/o(-Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys)-NH\n2\n (See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,674,839 and 5,576,290) and Ac-Nle-cyc/o(-Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys)-OH (See U.S. Patent Nos. 6,579,968 and 6,794,489). These and other melanocortin receptor-specific peptides generally contain the central tetrapeptide sequence of native α-MSH, His\n6\n-Phe\n7\n-Arg\n8\n-Trp\n9\n (SEQ ID NO:1 ), or a mimetic or variation thereof, such as the substitution of D-Phe for Phe\n7\n.

Melanocortin receptor-specific cyclic peptides disclosed in the foregoing are typically cyclized through a lactam bridge formed by the side chains of Asp (aspartic acid) and Lys (lysine), or alternatively through a disulfide bridge formed by the side chains of two Cys (cysteine) or other reactive thiol-containing residues. Melanocortin receptor-specific linear peptides are known which contain GIu (glutamic acid) and\n\n\nOrn (ornithine), including certain linear peptides disclosed in WO2008/025094 and U.S. Patent No. \n\n 5,674,839. Cyclic peptides asserted to be specific for one or more melanocortin receptors and containing a GIu and Orn are known, but are peptides in which the cyclic portion thereof consists of seven amino acids, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,951 ,916 and 6,613,874. In such peptides, there are five amino acids between the GIu and Orn residues, and thus the cyclic peptide ring contains 26 ring atoms.\n\n\nMelanocortin receptor-specific peptides may be evaluated by a number of parameters, including binding affinities (typically Ki values reported in nM) and various functional measures, such as EC\n50\n and E\nmax\n values. While melanocortin receptor-specific cyclic peptides are reported with nanomolar or subnanomolar Ki values, for pharmaceutical development for many indications it is desired and necessary to optimize functionality, such as EC\n50\n and E\nmax\n values, such that the peptides are agonists, preferably full agonists, more preferably potent full agonists, with nanomolar or subnanomolar EC\n50\n values and E\nmax\n values as high as feasible, such as over about 80%, about 90% or at or over 100%.

A melanocortin receptor agonist may be an agonist at one or more of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R), melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R), melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3-R) and melanocortin-5 receptor (MC5-R).\n\n\nBy \"α-MSH\" is meant the peptide Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:2) and analogs and homologs thereof, including without limitation NDP-α-MSH.\n\n\nBy \"NDP-α-MSH\" is meant the peptide Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-N Ie-GIu-H is-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro- VaI-NH\n2\n and analogs and homologs thereof.\n\n\nBy \"EC\n50\n\" is meant the molar concentration of an agonist, including a partial agonist, which produced 50% of the maximum possible response for that agonist. By way of example, a test compound which, at a concentration of 72 nM, produces 50% of the maximum possible response for that compound as determined in a cAMP assay in an MC4-R cell expression system has an EC\n50\n of 72 nM. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with an EC\n50\n determination is in nanomoles per liter (nM).\n\n\nBy \"Ki (nM)\" is meant the equilibrium inhibitor dissociation constant representing the molar concentration of a competing compound that binds to half the binding sites of a receptor at equilibrium in the absence of radioligand or other competitors. In general, the numeric value of the Ki is inversely correlated to the affinity of the compound for the receptor, such that if the Ki is low, the affinity is high. Ki may be determined using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (Cheng Y., Prusoff W. H., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22: 3099-3108, 1973): \n\n\n where \"ligand\" is the concentration of radioligand and K\nD\n is an inverse measure of receptor affinity for the radioligand which produces 50% receptor occupancy by the radioligand. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with a Ki determination is in nM. Ki may be expressed in terms of specific receptors (e.g., MC1-R, MC3-R, MC4-R or MC5-R) and specific ligands (e.g., α-MSH or NDP-α- MSH).\n\n\nBy \"inhibition\" is meant the percent attenuation, or decrease in receptor binding, in a competitive inhibition assay compared to a known standard. Thus, by \"inhibition at 1 μM (NDP-α-MSH)\" is meant the percent decrease in binding of NDP-α-MSH by addition of a determined amount of the compound to be tested, such as 1 μM of a test compound, such as under the assay conditions hereafter described. By way of example, a test compound that does not inhibit binding of NDP-α-MSH has a 0% inhibition, and a test compound that completely inhibits binding of NDP-α-MSH has a 100% inhibition. Typically, as described hereafter, a radio assay is used for competitive inhibition testing, such as with I\n125\n-labeled NDP-α-MSH, or a lanthanide chelate fluorescent assay, such as with Eu-NDP-α-MSH. However, other methods of testing competitive inhibition are known, including use of label or tag systems other than \n\n radioisotopes, and in general any method known in the art for testing competitive inhibition may be employed in this invention. It may thus be seen that \"inhibition\" is one measure to determine whether a test compound attenuates binding of α-MSH to melanocortin receptors.\n\n\nBy \"binding affinity\" is meant the ability of a compound or drug to bind to its biological target, expressed herein as Ki (nM).\n\n\nBy \"E\nmax\n\" is meant the maximal functional activity achievable by a compound in a specified melanocortin receptor expressing cell system, such as the maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. The maximal stimulation achieved by NDP-α-MSH is designated as an E\nmax\n of 100% and a compound capable of stimulating half the maximal activity of NDP-α-MSH is designated as having an E\nmax\n of 50%. A compound of this invention that under assay conditions described herein has an E\nmax\n of 70% or higher is classified as an agonist, a compound with an E\nmax\n between 10% and 70% is classified as a partial agonist, and a compound with an E\nmax\n below 10% is classified as inactive.\n\n\nIn general, \"functional activity\" is a measure of the signaling of a receptor, or measure of a change in receptor-associated signaling, such as a melanocortin receptor, and in particular MC4-R or hMC4-R, upon activation by a compound. Melanocortin receptors initiate signal transduction through activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. In one aspect, melanocortin receptors signal through Gα\ns\n, which catalyzes production of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase. Thus determination of stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, such as determination of maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, is one measure of functional activity, and is the primary measure exemplified herein. However, it is to be understood that alternative measures of functional activity may be employed in the practice of this invention, and are specifically contemplated and included within the scope of this invention. Thus, in one example intracellular free calcium may be measured, such as reported by and using the methods disclosed in Mountjoy K.G. et al., Melanocortin receptor-medicated mobilization of intracellular free calcium in HEK293 cells. Physiol Genomics 5:11-19, 2001 , or Kassack M. U. et al., Functional screening of G protein-coupled receptors by measuring intracellular calcium with a fluorescence microplate reader. Biomol Screening 7:233-246,\n\n\n2002. It is also possible to measure activation by measurement of the production of inositol triphosphate or diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, such as by use of radioassays. Yet another measure of functional activity is receptor internalization, resulting from activation of regulatory pathways, such as using the methods disclosed in Nickolls S.A. et al., Functional selectivity of melanocortin 4 receptor peptide and nonpeptide agonists: evidence for ligand specific conformational states. J Pharm Exper Therapeutics 313:1281-1288, 2005. Yet another measure of functional activity is the exchange, and exchange rate, of nucleotides associated with activation of a G protein receptor, such as the exchange of GDP (guanosine diphosphate) for GTP (guanosine triphosphase) on the G protein α subunit, which may be measured by any number of means, including a radioassay using guanosine 5'-(γ- [\n35\nS]thio)-triphosphate, as disclosed in Manning D. R., Measures of efficacy using G proteins as endpoints: differential engagement of G proteins through single receptors. MoI Pharmacol 62:451-452, 2002. Various gene-based assays have been developed for measuring activation of G-coupled proteins, such as those disclosed in Chen W. et al., A colorimetric assay from measuring activation of Gs- and Gq- coupled signaling pathways. Anal Biochem 226:349-354, 1995; Kent T.C. et al., Development of a generic dual-reporter gene assay for screening G-protein-coupled receptors. Biomol Screening, 5:437- 446, 2005; or Kotarsky K. et al., Improved receptor gene assays used to identify ligands acting on orphan \n\n seven-transmembrane receptors. Pharmacology & Toxicology 93:249-258, 2003. The colorimetric assay of Chen et al. has been adapted for use in measuring melanocortin receptor activation, as disclosed in Hruby V.J. et al., Cyclic lactam α-melanocortin analogues of Ac-Nle\n4\n-cyclo[Asp\n5\n,D- Phe\n7\n,Lys\n101\n α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-(4-10)-NH\n2\n with bulky aromatic amino acids at position 7 shows high antagonist potency and selectivity at specific melanocortin receptors. J Med Chem 38:3454- 3461 , 1995.

The term is not limited to physiological conditions, and includes psychogenic conditions or perceived impairment without a formal diagnosis of pathology or disorder. Sexual dysfunction includes erectile dysfunction in a male mammal and female sexual dysfunction in a female mammal. \"Erectile dysfunction\" is a disorder involving the failure of a male mammal to achieve functional erection, ejaculation, or both. Erectile dysfunction is accordingly synonymous with impotence, and includes the inability to attain or sustain an erection of sufficient rigidity for coitus. Symptoms of erectile dysfunction include an inability to achieve or maintain an erection, ejaculatory failure, premature ejaculation, or inability to achieve an orgasm. An increase in erectile dysfunction is often associated with age or may be caused by a physical disease or as a side-effect of drug treatment.\n\n\n\"Female sexual dysfunction\" is a disorder including sexual arousal disorder. The term \"sexual arousal disorder\" includes a persistent or recurrent failure to attain or maintain the lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement until completion of sexual activity. Sexual dysfunction in females can also include inhibited orgasm and dyspareunia, which is painful or difficult coitus. Female sexual dysfunction includes, but is not limited to, a number of categories of diseases, conditions and disorders including hypoactive sexual desire disorder, sexual anhedonia, sexual arousal disorder, dyspareunia and vaginismus. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder includes a disorder in which sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity are persistently or recurrently diminished or absent, causing marked distress or interpersonal difficulties. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder can be caused by boredom or unhappiness in a long-standing relationship, depression, dependence on alcohol or psychoactive drugs, side effects from prescription drugs, or hormonal deficiencies. Sexual anhedonia includes decreased or absent pleasure in sexual activity. Sexual anhedonia can be caused by depression, drugs, or interpersonal factors. Sexual arousal disorder can be caused by reduced estrogen, illness, or treatment with diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants, or antihypertensive agents. Dyspareunia and vaginismus are sexual pain disorders characterized by pain resulting from penetration and may be caused, for example, by medications which reduce lubrication, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, inflammatory bowel disease or urinary tract problems.\n\n\nThroughout the specification and claims, reference to \"Asp ...Lys\" is to be understood to refer to cyclization of a peptide through the side chains of Asp and Lys, with the \"...\" representing the amino acid residues within the cyclic portion of the peptide, \"GIu ...Orn\" is to be understood to refer to cyclization of a peptide through the side chains of GIu and Orn, and \"Orn ...GIu is to be understood to refer to cyclization of a peptide through the side chains of Orn and GIu (in each instance conventionally orienting the peptide in an N-terminus to C-terminus sequence).\n\n\n2.0 Clinical Indications and Utility.

Preferably the peptide of the present invention is administered within one hour, preferably within less than one-half hour, of administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent. However, for certain forms of combination therapy, such as for example in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a hormone or hormone-related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent, the hormone or hormone-related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent may be administered on an independent schedule, such that there is no set or specific temporal relationship between administration of the peptide of the present invention and the hormone or hormone- related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent. Thus, for example, the hormone or hormone-related sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent may be administered on a daily or other dose, or by means of patches or other continuous administration schedules, with administration of the peptide of the present invention when desired or needed by the patient.\n\n\nThe present invention thus provides methods of treating sexual dysfunction, the methods comprising the step of administering to a patient having or at risk of having sexual dysfunction a therapeutically effective amount of a cyclic peptide of the present invention in combination with another compound that is useful in the treatment of sexual dysfunction. In a preferred embodiment of combination therapy the sexual dysfunction is female sexual dysfunction. In an especially preferred embodiment of combination therapy the sexual dysfunction is erectile dysfunction.\n\n\nThe present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a cyclic peptide of the present invention and a second compound useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction. In an embodiment of the composition, the additional compounds useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction are preferably selected from but not limited to the group consisting of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor; a cyclic-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor; prostaglandins; apomorphine; oxytocin modulators; α- adrenergic antagonists; androgens; selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs); buproprion; vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP); neutral endopeptidase inhibitors (NEP); and neuropeptide Y receptor antagonists (NPY).\n\n\nIn an embodiment of the method and composition, the second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent is testosterone.\n\n\nIn another embodiment of combination therapy, the second sexual dysfunction pharmaceutical agent is a type V phosphodiesterase (PDE-5) inhibitor. For example, the PDE-5 inhibitor may be Viagra\n®\n, a brand of sildenafil, Levitra\n®\n, a brand of monohydrochloride salt of vardenafil, or Cialis\n®\n, a brand of tadalafil. Other PDE-5 inhibitors are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 7,235,625, issued June 22, 2007, and entitled \"Multiple Agent Therapy for Sexual Dysfunction\", incorporated here by reference. In another embodiment of the composition above, the compound useful for the treatment of sexual dysfunction is an estrogen agonist/antagonist. In one embodiment, the estrogen agonist/antagonist is (-)-cis-6-phenyl-5-[-4-(2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-ethoxy)-phenyl]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-napth- \n\n thalene-2-ol (also known as lasofoxifene) or an optical or geometric isomer thereof; a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, N-oxide, ester, quaternary ammonium salt; or a prodrug thereof.

In one aspect, the composition is formulated for subcutaneous injection, and a subcutaneous injection is given one or more times each day, preferably prior to a meal, more preferably between about one and about three hours prior to a mean. In another aspect, the composition is formulated as an injectable time release formulation, typically administered by means of a deep intramuscular injection, such as in the gluteal or deltoid muscle. In one embodiment, a peptide of the present invention is formulated with a polyethylene glycol, such as polyethylene glycol 3350, and optionally one or more additional excipients and preservatives, including but not limited to excipients such as salts, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid to adjust pH, and the like.

Any of a number of well-known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the peptides of the present invention.\n\n\nThe cyclic peptides of the present invention may be readily synthesized by known conventional procedures for the formation of a peptide linkage between amino acids. Such conventional procedures include, for example, any solution phase procedure permitting a condensation between the free alpha amino group of an amino acid residue having its carboxyl group and other reactive groups protected and the free primary carboxyl group of another amino acid residue having its amino group or other reactive groups protected. In a preferred conventional procedure, the cyclic peptides of the present invention may be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and purified according to methods known in the art. Any of a number of well-known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the peptides of the present invention.\n\n\nThe process for synthesizing the cyclic peptides may be carried out by a procedure whereby each amino acid residue in the desired sequence is added one at a time in succession to another amino acid residue or by a procedure whereby peptide fragments with the desired amino acid sequence are first synthesized conventionally and then condensed to provide the desired peptide. The resulting peptide is then cyclized to yield a cyclic peptide of the invention.\n\n\nSolid phase peptide synthesis methods are well known and practiced in the art. In such methods the synthesis of peptides of the invention can be carried out by sequentially incorporating the desired amino acid residues one at a time into the growing peptide chain according to the general principles of solid phase methods. These methods are disclosed in numerous references, including Merrifield, R. B., Solid phase synthesis (Nobel lecture). Angew Chem 24:799-810 (1985) and Barany et al., The Peptides, \n\n Analysis, Synthesis and Biology, Vol. 2, Gross, E. and Meienhofer, J., Eds. Academic Press 1-284 (1980).\n\n\nIn chemical syntheses of peptides, reactive side chain groups of the various amino acid residues are protected with suitable protecting groups, which prevent a chemical reaction from occurring at that site until the protecting group is removed. Also common is the protection of the alpha amino group of an amino acid residue or fragment while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the alpha amino protecting group to allow a subsequent reaction to take place at that site. Specific protecting groups have been disclosed and are known in solid phase synthesis methods and solution phase synthesis methods. Alpha amino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, including a urethane-type protecting group, such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, such as p- chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-biphenyl- isopropoxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Moz) and aliphatic urethane-type protecting groups, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc). Fmoc is preferred for alpha amino protection.\n\n\nGuanidino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, such as nitro, p- toluenesulfonyl (Tos), Z, pentamethylchromanesulfonyl (Pmc), adamantyloxycarbonyl, pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Pbf) and Boc. Pbf and Pmc are preferred protecting groups for Arg. The peptides of the invention described herein were prepared using solid phase synthesis, such as by means of a Symphony Multiplex Peptide Synthesizer (Rainin Instrument Company/Protein Technologies Inc.) automated peptide synthesizer, using programming modules as provided by the manufacturer and following the protocols set forth in the manufacturer's manual.\n\n\nSolid phase synthesis is commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha amino acid to a suitable resin. Such starting material is prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin, a 2- chlorotrityl chloride resin or an oxime resin, by an amide bond between an Fmoc-Linker, such as p-[(R, S)-α-[1-(9H-fluor-en-9-yl)-methoxyformamido]-2,4-dimethyloxybenzyl]-phenoxyacetic acid (Rink linker) to a benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin, or by other means well known in the art. Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin supports are commercially available and generally used when feasible. The resins are carried through repetitive cycles as necessary to add amino acids sequentially. The alpha amino Fmoc protecting groups are removed under basic conditions. Piperidine, piperazine, diethylamine, or morpholine (20-40% v/v) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) may be used for this purpose.\n\n\nFollowing removal of the alpha amino protecting group, the subsequent protected amino acids are coupled stepwise in the desired order to obtain an intermediate, protected peptide-resin. The activating reagents used for coupling of the amino acids in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the art. After the peptide is synthesized, if desired, the orthogonally protected side chain protecting groups may be removed using methods well known in the art for further derivatization of the peptide. Typically, orthogonal protecting groups are used as appropriate. For example, the peptides of the invention contain multiple amino acids with an amino group-containing side chain. In one aspect, an \n\n Allyl-Alloc protection scheme is employed with the amino acids forming a lactam bridge through their side chains, and orthogonal protecting groups, cleavable under different reactive conditions, used for other amino acids with amino group-containing side chains. Thus, for example, Fmoc-Orn(Alloc)-OH and Fmoc-Glu(OAII)-OH amino acids (GIu(OAII) refers to glutamic acid 5-allyl ester) can be employed for the positions forming a lactam bridge upon cyclization, while other amino acids with amino group-containing side chains have a different and orthogonal protecting group, such as with Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc- Lys(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-Dab(Pbf)-OH or the like. Other protecting groups may be similarly employed; by way of example and not limitation, Mtt/OPp (4-methyltrityl/ 2-phenylisopropyl) can be employed with the side chains forming a lactam bridge upon cyclization, with orthogonal protecting groups being utilized for other positions that are not cleavable using conditions suitable for cleavage of Mtt/OPp.\n\n\nReactive groups in a peptide can be selectively modified, either during solid phase synthesis or after removal from the resin. For example, peptides can be modified to obtain N-terminus modifications, such as acetylation, while on resin, or may be removed from the resin by use of a cleaving reagent and then modified. Similarly, methods for modifying side chains of amino acids are well known to those skilled in the art of peptide synthesis. The choice of modifications made to reactive groups present on the peptide will be determined, in part, by the characteristics that are desired in the peptide.\n\n\nIn the peptides of the present invention, in one embodiment the N-terminus group is modified by introduction of an N-acetyl group. In one aspect, a method is employed wherein after removal of the protecting group at the N-terminal, the resin-bound peptide is reacted with acetic anhydride in dichloromethane in the presence of an organic base, such as diisopropylethylamine. Other methods of N-terminus acetylation are known in the art, including solution phase acetylation, and may be employed.\n\n\nThe peptide can, in one embodiment, be cyclized prior to cleavage from the peptide resin. For cyclization through reactive side chain moieties, the desired side chains are deprotected, and the peptide suspended in a suitable solvent and a cyclic coupling agent added. Suitable solvents include, for example DMF, dichloromethane (DCM) or 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Suitable cyclic coupling reagents include, for example, 2-(1 H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1 ,1 ,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 2-(1 H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1 ,1 ,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (BOP), benzotriazole-1-yl- oxy-tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), 2-(7-aza-1 H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1 , 1 ,3,3- tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TATU), 2-(2-oxo-1(2H)-pyridyl)-1 ,1 ,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TPTU) or N.N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/i-hydroxybenzotriazole (DCCI/HOBt). Coupling is conventionally initiated by use of a suitable base, such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), sym-collidine or N-methylmorpholine (NMM).\n\n\nThe cyclized peptides can then be cleaved from solid phase, using any suitable reagent, such as ethylamine in DCM or various combinations of agents, such as trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), tri- isopropylsilane (TIS), dimethoxybenezene (DMB), water and the like. The resulting crude peptide is dried and remaining amino acid side chain protecting groups, if any, are cleaved using any suitable reagent, such as TFA in the presence of water, TIS, 2-mercaptopethane (ME), and/or 1 ,2-ethanedithiol (EDT). The final product may be precipitated by adding cold ether and collected by filtration. Final purification is by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), using a suitable column, such as a Ci\n8\n column, or other methods of separation or purification, such as methods based on \n\n the size or charge of the peptide, may also be employed. Once purified, the peptide can be characterized by any number of methods, such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and the like.\n\n\nFor peptides of the present invention which have a C-terminus substituted amide derivative or N- alkyl group, synthesis may proceed by solid phase synthesis commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha amino acid to a suitable resin. Such methods for preparing substituted amide derivatives on solid-phase have been described in the art. See, for example, Barn D. R. et al., Synthesis of an array of amides by aluminum chloride assisted cleavage on resin bound esters. Tetrahedron Letters, 37:3213-3216 (1996); DeGrado W.F. and Kaiser E.T., Solid-phase synthesis of protected peptides on a polymer bound oxime: Preparation of segments comprising the sequences of a cytotoxic 26-peptide analogue. J. Org. Chem., 47:3258-3261 (1982). Such a starting material can be prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin, by amide linkage to a 4-(2', 4'-dimethoxylphenyl-aminomethyl-phenoxy (Rink Amide) resin, or an oxime resin, by well known means. The peptide chain is grown with the desired sequence of amino acids. Before cleavage, the peptide is cyclized on the solid phase, and the peptide- resin treated with a solution of appropriate amine (such as methyl amine, dimethyl amine, ethylamine, and so on). Peptides employing a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin may be cleaved from resin by aluminum chloride in DCM, peptides employing a Rink Amide resin may be cleaved by mixture of TFA, TIS and water, and peptides employing an oxime resin may be cleaved by DCM. While synthesis has been described primarily with reference to solid phase Fmoc chemistry, it is to be understood that other chemistries and synthetic methods may be employed to make the cyclic peptides of the invention, such as by way of example and not limitation, methods employing Boc chemistry, solution chemistry, and other chemistries and synthetic methods.\n\n\n6.0 Formulations. Depending on the desired route of administration, the formulation of a composition including one or more cyclic peptides of the present invention may be varied. Thus the formulation may be suitable for subcutaneous injection, or intravenous injection, for nasal spray applications, for inhalation applications, for other transdermal applications and the like.\n\n\n6.1 Salt Form of Cyclic Peptides of the Present Invention.

The acetate, ammonium acetate and trifluoracetic acid salt forms are especially useful. Where the peptides of the present invention include an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts may include alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts, or alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium or magnesium salts. It is also to be understood that certain peptides of formula (I) can exist in solvated forms, including solvates of the free peptide or solvates of a salt of the compound, as well as unsolvated forms. The term \"solvate\" is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term \"hydrate\" is employed when said solvent is water. It is to be understood that all polymorphs, including mixtures of different polymorphs, are included within the scope of the claimed peptides.\n\n\n6.2 Pharmaceutical Compositions.\n\n\nThe invention provides a pharmaceutical composition that includes a cyclic peptide of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier may be a liquid formulation, and is preferably a buffered, isotonic, aqueous solution. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers also include excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as hereafter described.\n\n\nThe cyclic peptide compositions of the present invention may be formulated or compounded into pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one cyclic peptide of the present invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, including excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as may be desired. Formulation excipients may include polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, hydroxy propyl cellulose, acacia, polyethylene glycol, mannitol, sodium chloride and sodium citrate. For injection or other liquid administration formulations, water containing at least one or more buffering constituents is preferred, and stabilizing agents, preservatives and solubilizing agents may also be employed. For solid administration formulations, any of a variety of thickening, filler, bulking and carrier additives may be employed, such as starches, sugars, cellulose derivatives, fatty acids and the like. For topical administration formulations, any of a variety of creams, ointments, gels, lotions and the like may be employed. For most pharmaceutical formulations, non-active ingredients will constitute the greater part, by weight or volume, of the preparation. For pharmaceutical formulations, it is also contemplated that any of a variety of measured-release, slow-release or sustained-release formulations and additives may \n\n be employed, so that the dosage may be formulated so as to provide delivery of a peptide of the present invention over a period of time.\n\n\nIn general, the actual quantity of cyclic peptides of the present invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending on the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired.\n\n\nIn practical use, the cyclic peptides of the invention can be combined as the active ingredient in an admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, for example, oral, parenteral (including intravenous), urethral, vaginal, nasal, buccal, sublingual, or the like. In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets.\n\n\nBecause of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent an advantageous oral dosage unit form. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. The amount of active peptide in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. In another advantageous dosage unit form, sublingual constructs may be employed, such as sheets, wafers, tablets or the like.\n\n\nThe tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain binders such as povidone, gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; diluents; fillers such as microcrystalline cellulose; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; disintegrating agents such as corn starch, potato starch or alginic acid; preservatives; colorants; lubricants such as magnesium stearate; and sweetening agents such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as fatty oil. Various other materials may be utilized as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.\n\n\nIf formulated for oral delivery, the peptide may be formulated and made such that it is encased in an enteric protectant, more preferably such that it is not released until the tablet or capsule has transited the stomach, and optionally has further transited a portion of the small intestine. In the context of this application it will be understood that the term enteric coating or material refers to a coating or material that will pass through the stomach essentially intact but will disintegrate after passing through the stomach to release the active drug substance. Materials that may be used includes cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl-ethylcellulose succinate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, and methacrylic acid-methyl methacrylate copolymer. The enteric coating employed promotes dissolution of the dosage form primarily at a site outside the stomach, and may be selected such that the enteric coating dissolves at a pH of approximately at least 5.5, more preferable at a pH of from about 6.0 to about 8.0. \n\n Any of a variety of permeation enhancers may be employed, to increase uptake in the intestines upon dissolution of the enteric coating. In one aspect, permeation enhancers increase either paracellular or transcellular transport systems. Representative, non-limiting examples of such permeation enhancers include calcium chelators, bile salts (such as sodium cholate), and fatty acids. In some embodiments, peptides or polypeptides that act as substrates for intestinal proteases are further added.\n\n\nCyclic peptides may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active peptides can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxy-propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. These preparations may optionally contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that it may be administered by syringe. The form must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol, for example glycerol, propylene glycol or liquid polyethylene glycol, suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.\n\n\nThe cyclic peptides of the present invention may be therapeutically applied by means of nasal administration.

The peptides may also be in a dry or powder formulation.\n\n\nThe cyclic peptides of the present invention may be formulated with any of a variety of agents that increase effective nasal absorption of drugs, including peptide drugs. These agents should increase nasal absorption without unacceptable damage to the mucosal membrane. U.S. Patents No. 5,693,608, 5,977,070 and 5,908,825, among others, teach a number of pharmaceutical compositions that may be employed, including absorption enhancers, and the teachings of each of the foregoing, and all references and patents cited therein, are incorporated by reference.\n\n\nIf in an aqueous solution, the cyclic peptides may be appropriately buffered by means of saline, acetate, phosphate, citrate, acetate or other buffering agents, which may be at any physiologically acceptable pH, generally from about pH 4 to about pH 7. A combination of buffering agents may also be employed, such as phosphate buffered saline, a saline and acetate buffer, and the like. In the case of saline, a 0.9% saline solution may be employed. In the case of acetate, phosphate, citrate, and the like, a 50 mM solution may be employed. In addition to buffering agents, a suitable preservative may be employed, to prevent or limit bacteria and other microbial growth. One such preservative that may be employed is 0.05% benzalkonium chloride.\n\n\nIn an alternative embodiment, cyclic peptides of the present invention may be administered directly into the lung, lntrapulmonary administration may be performed by means of a metered dose inhaler, a device allowing self-administration of a metered bolus of a peptide of the present invention when actuated by a patient during inspiration. In one aspect of this embodiment, the cyclic peptide may be in a dried and particulate form, for example particles between about 0.5 and 6.0 μm, such that the \n\n particles have sufficient mass to settle on the lung surface, and not be exhaled, but are small enough that they are not deposited on surfaces of the air passages prior to reaching the lung. Any of a variety of different techniques may be used to make dry powder microparticles, including but not limited to micro- milling, spray drying and a quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization. With micro-particles, the peptides may be deposited to the deep lung, thereby providing quick and efficient absorption into the bloodstream. Further, with such approach penetration enhancers are not required, as is sometimes the case in transdermal, nasal or oral mucosal delivery routes. Any of a variety of inhalers can be employed, including propel lant-based aerosols, nebulizers, single dose dry powder inhalers and multidose dry powder inhalers. Common devices in current use include metered dose inhalers, which are used to deliver medications for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the like.\n\n\nPreferred devices include dry powder inhalers, designed to form a cloud or aerosol of fine powder with a particle size that is always less than about 6.0 μm.\n\n\nMicroparticle size, including mean size distribution, may be controlled by means of the method of making. For micro-milling, the size of the milling head, speed of the rotor, time of processing and the like control the microparticle size. For spray drying, the nozzle size, flow rate, dryer heat and the like control the microparticle size. For making by means of quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization, the nozzle size, flow rate, concentration of aerosoled solution and the like control the microparticle size. These parameters and others may be employed to control the microparticle size.\n\n\nThe cyclic peptides of the present invention may be therapeutically administered by means of an injection of a sustained release formulation. In one embodiment, a cyclic peptide of the present invention is formulated for a deep intramuscular injection, such as in the gluteal or deltoid muscle, of a formulation with a polyethylene glycol, such as polyethylene glycol 3350, and optionally one or more additional excipients and preservatives, including but not limited to excipients such as salts, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid to adjust pH, and the like. In another embodiment a cyclic peptide of the present invention is formulated with a poly(ortho ester), which may be an auto-catalyzed poly(ortho ester) with any of a variable percentage of lactic acid in the polymeric backbone, and optionally one or more additional excipients. In one embodiment poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) polymer is employed. In general, any of a number of injectable and bioerodible polymers, which are preferably also adhesive polymers, may be employed in a sustained release injectable formulation. Alternatively other sustained release formulations may be employed, including formulations permitting subcutaneous injection, which other formulations may include one or more of nano/microspheres (such as compositions including PLGA polymers), liposomes, emulsions (such as water-in-oil emulstions), gels, insoluble salts or suspensions in oil The formulation may be such that an injection is required on a daily, weekly, monthly or other periodic basis, depending on the concentration and amount of cyclic peptide, the sustained release rate of the materials employed, and other factors known to those of skill in the art. 6.3 Routes of Administration.\n\n\nIf a composition including one or more peptides of the present invention is administered by injection, the injection may be intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or other means known in the art. The peptides of the present invention may be formulated by any means known in the art, including but not limited to formulation as tablets, capsules, caplets, suspensions, powders, lyophilized preparations, suppositories, ocular drops, skin patches, oral soluble formulations, sprays, \n\n aerosols and the like, and may be mixed and formulated with buffers, binders, excipients, stabilizers, antioxidants and other agents known in the art. In general, any route of administration by which the peptides of invention are introduced across an epidermal layer of cells may be employed. Administration means may thus include administration through mucous membranes, buccal administration, oral administration, dermal administration, inhalation administration, nasal administration, urethral administration, vaginal administration, and the like.\n\n\n6.4 Therapeutically Effective Amount.\n\n\nIn general, the actual quantity of cyclic peptide of the present invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending upon the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired. The dosage for treatment is administration, by any of the foregoing means or any other means known in the art, of an amount sufficient to bring about the desired therapeutic effect. The cyclic peptides of the present invention are highly active. For example, the cyclic peptide can be administered at about 0.1 , 0.5, 1 , 5, 50, 100, 500, 1000 or 5000 μg/kg body weight, depending on the specific peptide selected, the desired therapeutic response, the route of administration, the formulation and other factors known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n7.0 Tests and Assays Employed in Evaluation of the Peptides of the Present Invention. The melanocortin receptor-specific peptides of the present invention of this invention may be tested by a variety of assay systems and animal models to determine binding, functional status and efficacy. 7.1 Competitive Inhibition Assay using [l\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH.\n\n\nA competitive inhibition binding assay was performed using membrane homogenates prepared from HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC4-R, hMC3-R, or hMC5-R, and from B-16 mouse melanoma cells (containing endogenous MC1-R). In some instances, HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC1-R were employed. In the examples that follow, all MC3-R, MC4-R and MC5-R values are for human recombinant receptors. MC1-R values are for B-16 mouse melanoma cells, unless the heading is \"hMC1-R\", in which case the value is for human recombinant MC1-R. Assays were performed in 96 well GF/B Millipore multiscreen filtration plates (MAFB NOB10) pre-coated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V). Membrane homogenates were incubated with 0.2nM (for hMC4-R) 0.4 nM (for MC3-R and MC5-R) or 0.1 nM (for mouse B16 MC1-R or hMC1-R) [l\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH (Perkin Elmer) and increasing concentrations of test peptides of the present invention in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) with 100 mM NaCI, 2 mM CaCI\n2\n, 2 mM MgCI\n2\n, 0.3 mM 1 ,10-phenanthroline, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After incubation for 60 minutes at 37° C, the assay mixture was filtered and the membranes washed three times with ice-cold buffer. Filters were dried and counted in a gamma counter for bound radioactivity. Non-specific binding was measured by inhibition of binding of [l\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH in the presence of 1 μM NDP-α-MSH. Maximal specific binding (100%) was defined as the difference in radioactivity (cpm) bound to cell membranes in the absence and presence of 1 μM NDP-α-MSH. Radioactivity (cpm) obtained in the presence of test peptides was normalized with respect to 100% specific binding to determine the percent inhibition of [l\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH binding. Ki values for test peptides of the present invention were determined using Graph-Pad Prism® curve-fitting software. 7.2 Competitive Binding Assay Using Eu-NDP-α-MSH \n\n Alternatively, a competitive inhibition binding assay was performed employing Eu-NDP-α-MSH (PerkinElmer Life Sciences catalog No. AD0225) with determination by time-resolved fluorometry (TRF) of the lanthanide chelate. In comparison studies with [l\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH, the same values, within experimental error ranges, were obtained for percent inhibition and Ki. Typically competition experiments to determine Ki values were conducted by incubating membrane homogenates prepared from HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC4-R with 9 different concentrations of test peptides of interest and 1 nM of Eu-NDP-α-MSH in a solution containing 25 mM HEPES buffer with 100 mM NaCI, 2 mM CaCI\n2\n, 2 mM MgCI\n2\n, 0.1 % BSA and 0.3 mM 1 ,10-phenanthroline. After incubation for 90 minutes at 37\n0\nC, the reaction was stopped by filtration over AcroWell 96-well filter plates (Pall Life Sciences). The filter plates were washed 4 times with 200 μL of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. DELFIA Enhancement solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well. The plates were incubated on a shaker for 15 minutes and read at 340 nm excitation and 615 nm emission wavelengths. Each assay was conducted in duplicate and mean values were utilized. Ki values were determined by curve-fitting with Graph-Pad Prism® software using a one-site fixed-slope competition binding model. 7.3 Assay for Agonist Activity.\n\n\nAccumulation of intracellular cAMP was examined as a measure of the ability of the peptides of the present invention to elicit a functional response in HEK-293 cells that express MC4-R. Confluent HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC4-R were detached from culture plates by incubation in enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer. Dispersed cells were suspended in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCI\n2\n, 1 mM glutamine, 0.5% albumin and 0.3 mM 3-isobutyl- 1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 0.5 x 10\n5\n cells per well and pre-incubated for 10 minutes. Cells were exposed for 15 minutes at 37° C to peptides of the present invention dissolved in DMSO (final DMSO concentration of 1 %) at a concentration range of 0.05 - 5000 nM in a total assay volume of 200 μL. NDP-α-MSH was used as the reference agonist. cAMP levels were determined by an HTRF® cAMP cell-based assay system from\n\n\nCisbio Bioassays utilizing cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP, with plates read on a PerkinElmer Victor plate reader at 665 and 62OnM. Data analysis was performed by nonlinear regression analysis with Graph-Pad Prism\n®\n software. The maximum efficacies of the test peptides of the present invention were compared to that achieved by the reference melanocortin agonist NDP-α-MSH. 7.4 High and Low Density hMC4-R Functional Assay.\n\n\nA HEK293 cell line transfected with human MC4-R (from Palatin Technologies, US, with license from the University of Michigan) was used. The human MC4-R was introduced to HEK293 by using the T-REx™ System, Invitrogen. The T-REx™ System employs a tetracycline-regulated mammalian expression system that uses regulatory elements from the E. coli Tn 70-encoded tetracycline (Tet) resistance operon. By use of the T-REx™ System, expression of the gene of interest, the human MC4-R gene, is repressed in the absence of tetracycline or doxycycline and induced in the presence of tetracycline or doxycycline (see T-REx™ System Manual, published by Invitrogen).\n\n\nHEK293-T-REx-MC4-R cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco 11965,) supplemented with L- Glutamine (Gibco 25030), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 200 μg/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen 46-0072) and 6 mg/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen 46-1120) in 5% CO\n2\n and 95% humidity at 37\n0\nC. T-150 flasks of cells at 75% confluence were incubated with two concentrations of doxycycline (0.1 ng/mL to provide a low \n\n density hMC4-R system and 10 ng/mL to provide a high density hMC4-R system) in 5% CO\n2\n at 37°C for 16-18 hours to induce MC4-R expression. On the day of the assay, the cells were washed with PBS (Gibco 14190) and harvested using cell dissociation buffer (Gibco 13150-016), then centrifuged and resuspended in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (+Ca, +Mg) (Gibco 14025), 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1- piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH 7.4) (Sigma H0887), 1 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco 25030), 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma A3311 ) and 0.3 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine (IBMX). Cells were then counted and volume was adjusted to 5 x 10\n4\n cells per 200 μl_.\n\n\nThe cells were then dispensed into 96-well plates (BD 353916) in 198 μl_ (about 5 x 10\n4\n) cells/well and incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C. The compound to be tested was diluted with DMSO to a final concentration of 1 mM. Serial dilution was prepared in polypropylene removable 12-well library tube strips (VWR cat# 83009-682). 120 μl_ of the 1 mM compound stock was pipetted in the second column on the plate. Using the Janus liquid handler the compound was serially diluted 1 :10 (25 μl_ compound + 225 μl_ DMSO) to a total of 10 concentrations (ranging from 10\n'5\n to 10\n'13\n M).\n\n\n2 μl_ of the standard, [NIe\n4\n, D-Phe\n7\n]-alpha-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (NDP-α-MSH), or compound was added to the 96-well plate using the Janus robotic system. All assay samples were run in duplicate (i.e. each sample was in two low dox and two high dox plates, respectively). The plates were gently shaken and incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 15 μL of lysis buffer per well and the plates were shakened for 30 minutes at room temperature.\n\n\nAgonist stimulation of the MC4-R activates adenylate cyclase, which is an enzyme that catalyses the formation 3\n'\n,5\n'\n-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Thus, agonist stimulation of the MC4-R increases the levels of cAMP. cAMP-levels were measured with the cAMP dynamic 2 HTRF kit (CisBio cat# 62AM4PEC; see manual published by CisBio). cAMP levels were normalised against plate controls (2% DMSO for 0%, 400 nM NDP-α-MSH for 100%) and a calibration curve ranging from 712 nM to 0.04 nM cAMP (as described in the CisBio HTRF kit). The plates were incubated on a shaker at room temperature for 1 hour and read on the Perkin-Elmer Victor plate reader at 665 and 620 nm. Fluoresence ratios were then calculated as described in the CisBio HTRF kit, with GraphPad Prism software used to plot the change in fluorescence percent values versus cAMP concentration using the variable slope dose response curve and, based on calculated cAMP concentrations, to determine EC\n50\n and E\nmax\n values. 7.5 Food Intake and Body Weight Change.\n\n\nChange in food intake and body weight is evaluated for selected peptides administered by intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous injection routes. Male Sprague-Dawley rats are obtained from Hilltop Lab Animals, Inc. (Scottsdale, PA) or other vendors. Animals are individually housed in conventional polystyrene hanging cages and maintained on a controlled 12 hour on/off light cycle. Water and pelleted food was provided ad libitum. The rats are dosed IV with vehicle or selected peptides (0.3 to 1.0 mg/kg), or dosed subcutaneously with vehicle or selected peptides (doses up to 30 mg/kg). The changes in body weight and food intake for the 24 hour period after dosing is determined. The changes in body weight and food intake for the 48 hour and 72 hour periods after dosing can also be measured to determine reversal of changes in body weight and food intake effects back to baseline levels. \n\n 7.6 Induction of Penile Erection.\n\n\nThe ability of peptides of the present invention to induce penile erection (PE) in male rats are evaluated. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g are kept on a 12 hour on/off light cycle with food and water ad libitum. All behavioral studies are performed between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Groups of 6- 8 rats are administered peptides at a variety of doses via an IV route. Immediately after treatment, rats are placed into individual polystyrene cages (27 cm long, 16 cm wide, and 25 cm high) for behavioral observation, typically by remote video monitoring. Rats are observed for one hour, and the number of yawns, grooming bouts and PEs are recorded in 10-minute bins. 8.0 Peptides of the Present Invention. In one aspect, the invention provides a cyclic peptide which contains a core sequence derived from or a modification of the sequence His-Phe-Arg-Trp within the cyclic portion, which peptide is cyclized through a GIu adjacent the His (or derivative, modification of or substitute for His) and an Orn adjacent the Trp (or derivative, modification of or substitute for Trp), or alternatively an Orn adjacent the His (or derivative, modification of or substitute for His) and a GIu adjacent the Trp (or derivative, modification of or substitute for Trp) . The cyclic peptide is at least a cyclic hexapeptide, containing six amino acids including both GIu and Orn within the cyclic portion, and optionally is a cyclic heptapeptide or larger cyclic peptide, with one or more additional amino acid residues outside the cyclic portion on either or both the N-terminus or C-terminus ends.\n\n\nThe core sequence derived from His-Phe-Arg-Trp typically will include unsubstituted or substituted Phe in the Phe position, such as substituted or subsubstituted D-Phe, but a variety of amino acids may be utilitized for the remaining amino acids in the core sequence. In general, the His position may be a substituted or unsubstituted Pro, or may be an amino acid with a side chain including at least one primary amine, secondary amine, alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alcohol, ether, sulfide, sulfone, sufoxide, carbamoyl or carboxyl. The Arg position may be a substituted or unsubstituted Pro, or may be an amino acid with a side chain including at least one primary amine, secondary amine, guanidine, urea, alkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloheteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, or ether. The Trp position may be an amino acid with a side chain including at least one substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl.\n\n\nIn another aspect, it has been found that a lactam bridge wherein the amide bond is positioned by means of the side chain of GIu or Orn (at the N-terminus of the cyclic portion) and the side chain of Orn or GIu (at the C-terminus end of the cyclic portion) has superior efficacy, such as efficacy determined by EC\n50\n or E\nmax\n values, compared to peptides wherein the lactam bridge amide bond is positioned by means of the side chains of Asp and Lys, but which are otherwise identical. Such peptides do not necessarily show increased binding affinity, such as measured by Ki values, compared to peptides wherein the lactam bridge amide bond is positioned by means of the side chains of Asp and Lys, but which are otherwise identical. However, for many diagnostic and medical applications the functional efficacy, such as efficacy determined by EC\n50\n or E\nmax\n values, is critical for desired biological and/or pharmacological activities. This discovery is contrary to assertions in the prior art that the location and direction of an amide bond in the lactam bridge of melanocortin receptor-specific peptides is of little importance for activity, and does not interact with receptors. See, for example, Bednarek MA et al., Potent and selective peptide agonists of α-melanotropin action at human melanocortin receptor 4: their systhesis and biological evaluation in vitro. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 286:641-645 (2001 ). \n\n Cyclic peptides of the invention accordingly include those wherein the side chains of the amino acids forming a cyclic lactam bridge have the structure -(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-C(=O)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\n3\n- or -(CH\n2\n)\n3\n-NH-C(=O)- (CH\n2\n)\n2\n- Such compounds may, but need not, include peptides where an amino acid in the first position outside the cyclic portion has a side chain including at least one primary amine, guanidine or urea group. Alternatively, the amino acid in the first position outside the cyclic portion may be any amino acid, including without limitation amino acids with a side chain including a C\n1\n to C\n4\n linear or branched alkyl. It may readily be seen by reference to the peptides actually made as set forth in section 8.1 hereof that diverse and multiple substitutions may be made to the peptides, and still be within the scope and intent of this aspect of the invention. The lactam bridge wherein the amide bond is positioned by means of the side chain of GIu or\n\n\nOrn (at the N-terminus of the cyclic portion) and the side chain of Orn or GIu (at the C-terminus end of the cyclic portion) was designed on the basis of an in-house MC4-R agonist pharmacophore model with three key interactions in the MC4-R receptor-ligand binding site: a hydrophobic binding region surrounded by the Trp\n258\n on helix 6 and adjacent residues to which the phenyl ring of D-Phe ring or an equivalent ring binds, a positive-charged group binding region to directly interact with negative-charged Asp\n126\n on helix 3 of the receptor, and a polar group binding region to form a hydrogen bond interaction with His\n264\n on helix 6. This three-point pharmacophore model, illustrated in FIG. 1 , suggests that Asp\n126\n on helix 3 acts as an anchor for an agonist to bind strongly with MC4-R while the other two interaction sites on helix 6 can be used as leverage points to adjust the pose of helix 6, which is believed to be critical for triggering MC4-R agonism. Compared with other reported MC4-R pharmacophore models, the model of FIG. 1 emphasizes the hypothesized role of His\n264\n in controlling the molecular mechanism of MC4-R agonism.\n\n\nThe assumption behind this pharmacophore model is that helix 6 plays a critical role in MC4-R agonism and further that it is possible to effectively influence the degree of MC4-R agonism response by adjusting the pose of helix 6. His\n264\n was previously identified in mutagenesis studies (Pogozheva I. D. et al., Interactions of human melanocortin 4 receptor with nonpeptide and peptide agonists. Biochemistry 44:11329-11341 (2005)), and is located near the extracellular end of helix 6 and faces to the inside of the ligand binding pocket in our MC4-R homology models. The MC4-R docking model of certain cyclic peptides of this invention shows that the side chain lactam linkage group is presumptively located close to His\n264\n, and that by adjusting the lactam group position a direct hydrogen bond interaction with His\n264\n is possible. This is graphically illustrated by FIG. 2, which illustrates proposed binding modes of the prior art peptide Ac-Nle-cyc/o(Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys)-OH (shown in (a)), peptide No. 1 of the invention of the sequence Ac-Nle-cyc/o(Glu-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Orn)-OH (shown in (b)) and peptide No. 34 of the invention of the sequence Ac-Nle-cyc/o(Orn-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Glu)-OH (shown in (c)), all in the MC4-R binding site as suggested by molecular modeling studies. Proposed intermolecular hydrogen bonds between His\n264\n of the receptor and the prior art peptide and each of peptides No. 1 and 34 are indicated by dashed lines. The prior art peptide, shown in (a) in FIG. 2, is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,579,968 and 6,794,489. Peptide No. 1 , a peptide of this invention shown in (b) in FIG. 2, is an analog peptide with a lactam shift by one atom, such that Asp is replaced with GIu and Lys is replaced with Orn. Peptide No. 34, a peptide of this invention shown in (c) in FIG. 2, is an analog peptide with a lactam shift by three atoms, such that Asp is replaced with Orn and Lys is replaced with GIu. It is hypothesized, based in part \n\n upon computational docking models, and without wishing to be bound by theory, that His\n264\n forms a lateral hydrogen bond interaction with the backbone carbonyl group of Trp\n9\n on the prior art peptide cyclized through Asp ...Lys, with obvious consequences with respect to the position of helix 3. A constrained conformational analysis inside the binding pocket revealed that a simple position shift of the side-chain linkage lactam group by one atom may be enough to re-position this polar group to form a hydrogen bond interaction with His\n264\n from the front, as shown in FIG. 2 (b) with peptide No. 2. Further analysis also indicated that a position shift of this lactam group by three atoms may point this polar group to the same direction to form a hydrogen bond interaction with His\n264\n as well, as shown in FIG. 2 (c) with peptide No. 34. It is further hypothesized, again without being bound by theory, that these changes of the direction of a highly critical hydrogen bond for MC4-R agonism, resulting from the lactam shifts by employing a cyclic lactam bridge having either the structure -(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-C(=O)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\n3\n- or -(CH\n2\n)\n3\n-NH- C(=O)-(CH\n2\n)\n2\n, have a profound influence on its agonist activity.\n\n\nThe peptides encompassed within formulas (I) and (III) contain one or more asymmetric elements such as stereogenic centers, stereogenic axes and the like, so that the peptides encompassed within formulas (I) and (III) can exist in different stereoisomeric forms. For both specific and generically described peptides, including the peptides encompassed within formulas (I) and (III), all forms of isomers at all chiral or other isomeric centers, including enantiomers and diastereomers, are intended to be covered herein. The peptides of the invention each include multiple chiral centers, and may be used as a racemic mixture or an enantiomerically enriched mixture, in addition to use of the peptides of the invention in enantiopure preparations. Typically, the peptides of the invention will be synthesized with the use of chirally pure reagents, such as specified L- or D-amino acids, using reagents, conditions and methods such that enantiomeric purity is maintained, but it is possible and contemplated that racemic mixtures may be made. Such racemic mixtures may optionally be separated using well-known techniques and an individual enantiomer may be used alone. In cases and under specific conditions of temperature, solvents and pH wherein peptides may exist in tautomeric forms, each tautomeric form is contemplated as being included within this invention whether existing in equilibrium or predominantly in one form. Thus a single enantiomer of a peptide of formulas (I) and (III), which is an optically active form, can be obtained by asymmetric synthesis, synthesis from optically pure precursors, or by resolution of the racemates. The peptides of formula (II) is a specific stereoisomeric form of the peptides of formula (I), but the invention should not be construed as being limited to the stereoisomeric forms encompassed by formula (II).\n\n\nThe invention is further intended to include prodrugs of the present peptides, which on administration undergo chemical conversion by metabolic processes before becoming active pharmacological peptides. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the present peptides, which are readily convertible in vivo into a peptide of formulas (I) and (III). Prodrugs are any covalently bonded compounds, which release the active parent peptide drug of formulas (I) and (III) in vivo. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in \"Design of Prodrugs\", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985. Typical examples of prodrugs have biologically labile protecting groups on a functional moiety, such as for example by esterification of hydroxyl, carboxyl or amino functions. Thus by way of example and not limitation, a \n\n prodrug includes peptides of formula (I) wherein an ester prodrug form is employed, such as, for example, lower alkyl esters of an R group of formula (I), such as where R is -OH, which lower alkyl esters may include from 1-8 carbons in an alkyl radical or aralkyl esters which have 6-12 carbons in an aralkyl radical. Broadly speaking, prodrugs include compounds that can be oxidized, reduced, aminated, deaminated, hydroxylated, de hydroxy lated, hydrolyzed, dehydrolyzed, alkylated, dealkylated, acylated, deacylated, phosphorylated or dephosphorylated to produce an active parent peptide drug of formula (I) in vivo.\n\n\nThe subject invention also includes peptides which are identical to those recited in formula (I), but for the fact that one or more atoms depicted in formula (I) are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into peptides of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO and \n17\nO, respectively. Peptides of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates of said peptides which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labeled peptides of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as \n3\nH and \n14\nC are incorporated, may have use in a variety of assays, such as in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Substitution with heavier isotopes, such as substitution of one or more hydrogen atoms with deuterium (\n2\nH), can provide pharmacological advantages in some instances, including increased metabolic stability, lsotopically labeled peptides of formula (I) can generally be prepared by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.\n\n\n8.1 Specific peptides.\n\n\nPeptides of the following structures were synthesized by the general methods described above. In brief, the peptides were prepared by solid-phase synthesis method with Fmoc chemistry. Peptide amides were synthesized using Rink amide resin (EMD Biosciences, Inc. San Diego, CA). Peptide acids were prepared using Fmoc-Lys(Mtt)-p-alkoxy benzyl alcohol resin (0.55mmol/g, Bachem California Inc, Torrance, CA) or 4-Methoxybenzhydryl bromide resin (1.7 mmol/g, CBL Patras, Greece). The protecting groups for side chains were Arg(Pbf), Asp(OAII), GIu(OAII), His(Trt), Lys(Aloc), Orn(Aloc), Boc-4-amino- Pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid and Trp(Boc). Single coupling of each residue was performed using TBTU and diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) as coupling reagents, with a 3-fold excess of amino acid and 30-45 minute coupling times. Acetylation of the α-amino group of the N-terminal residue was normally carried out with 10 eq. acetic anhydride and 20 eq. pyridine in DMF for 30 minutes. The side chain lactam bridge was formed on resin after completion of peptidyl chain elongation, using 2 eq. TBTU and 4 eq. DIEA. Peptide was cleaved from resin by a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), triisopropylsilane (TIS) and water (v/v/v = 92.5/2.5/5.0) for 2-3 hours at room temperature. Crude preparation was precipitated from anhydrous ethyl ether. After centrifugation, and washing twice with ethyl ether, the resulting solid was dissolved in 50% acetic acid in water and stored overnight at room temperature to decarboxylate the N- carboxy group from the indole group of tryptophan residue. After removal of solvents by drying, the crude was purified by HPLC using a reverse phase preparative C-18 column. Pure fractions were pooled and lyophilized. \n\n Peptides of the present invention, which are peptides cychzed through GIu Orn side chains such that the lactam bridge has the structure -(CH\n2\n)\n2\n-C(=O)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\n3\n- from backbone carbon to backbone carbon, are set forth below in Table 1 Peptides of the present invention, which are peptides cychzed through Orn GIu side chains such that the lactam bridge has the structure -(CH\n2\n)\n3\n-NH-C(=O)- (CH\n2\n)\n2\n from backbone carbon to backbone carbon, are set forth below in Table 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n TABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.0 Comparison of Peptides of the Present Invention.\n\n\nPeptides of the present invention as shown in Tables 1 and 2 above were compared against analogs otherwise identical but which utilize an art conventional cyclization through Asp and Lys side chains such that the lactam bridge has the structure -CH\n2\n-C(=O)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\n4\n- from backbone carbon to backbone carbon.\n\n\n9.1 Assay Systems Employed.\n\n\nPeptides were tested for Ki values using [l\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH as described in section 7.1 above or Eu-NDP-α-MSH as described in section 7.2 above. EC\n50\n and E\nmax\n values were determined as generally described in sections 7.3 and 7.4 above, with functional activity at human MC4-R measured by a cAMP assay in HEK-293 cells constructed using the T-REx™ System and induced with doxycycline at a concentration of 0.1 ng/mL to produce a functional response similar to that with endogenous cell lines such as GT1-7. 9.2 Binding and Functional Data\n\n\nTable 3 below shows binding affinities (Ki) and functional activities (EC\n50\n and E\nmax\n) for certain peptides of the invention (\"Peptide Structure GIu... Orn\") together with corresponding data for analogs cyclized through Asp and Lys side chains (\"Peptide structure Asp... Lys\"). The reported values are averages of all comparable assays. Table 4 below shows binding affinities (Ki) and functional activities (EC\n50\n and E\nmax\n) for certain peptides of the invention (\"Peptide Structure Orn ...GIu\") together with corresponding data for analogs cyclized through Asp and Lys side chains (\"Peptide structure Asp... Lys\"). The reported values are averages of all comparable assays. \n\n TABLE 3\n\n\nUl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\nUl\n\n\n06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIG. 3 shows the change of functional efficacy (E\nmax\n) due to the side-chain GIu... Orn lactam shift, utilizing data as reported in Table 3. In all instances but two, functional efficacies were improved or maintained utilizing cyclization through GIu ...Orn, as compared to otherwise identical analogs cyclized through Asp ...Lys. The improvement was most dramatic at the low end, with weak partial agonists demonstrating more significant improvement in functional efficacy than strong full agonists.\n\n\nFIG. 4 shows the change of functional potency (EC\n50\n) caused by the side-chain GIu ...Orn lactam shift, utilizing data as reported in Table 3. All the cyclic peptides demonstrate an improvement in or maintenance of functional potency after this shift.\n\n\nAs shown in FIG. 5, by contrast Ki values, representing binding affinity, did not show a consistent significant change after side-chain GIu ...Orn lactam shift. Thus the observed improvement of MC4-R functional agonist activity, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 and Table 3, is not caused by an increase of binding affinity. This result supports the hypothesis that the shifted lactam group results in modified hydrogen bond interaction with His\n264\n which affects functional efficacy and potency without significantly or consistently increasing binding affinity. As shown in Table 3, some peptides that were partial agonists with cyclization through Asp and\n\n\nLys were converted to full agonists by cyclization through GIu and Orn. Accordingly, it may be that certain MC4-R neutral agonists or antagonists can be converted into full or partial agonists by utilizing cyclization through GIu and Orn.\n\n\nFIG. 6 shows the change of functional efficacy (E\nmax\n) due to the side-chain Orn... GIu lactam shift, utilizing data as reported in Table 4. In all instances but two, functional efficacies were improved or maintained utilizing cyclization through Orn ...GIu, as compared to otherwise identical analogs cyclized through Asp ...Lys. The improvement was most dramatic at the low end, with weak partial agonists demonstrating more significant improvement in functional efficacy than strong full agonists.\n\n\nFIG. 7 shows the change of functional potency (EC\n50\n) caused by the side-chain Orn... GIu lactam shift, utilizing data as reported in Table 4. All but one cyclic peptide demonstrated an improvement in functional potency after this shift.\n\n\nAs shown in FIG. 8, Ki values, representing binding affinity, also showed a slight but consistent change after the side-chain Orn ...GIu lactam shift. Thus the observed improvement of MC4-R functional agonist activity, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 and Table 5, may also relate in part to an increase in binding affinity with Orn... GIu cyclized peptides compared to paired Asp ...Lys peptides.\n\n\nAlthough the invention has been described in detail with particular reference to these preferred embodiments, other embodiments can achieve the same results. Variations and modifications of the present invention will be obvious to those skilled in the art and it is intended to cover all such modifications and equivalents. The entire disclosures of all references, applications, patents, and publications cited above are hereby incorporated by reference."

Description\n\n\n\n\n MELANOCORTIN RECEPTOR-SPECIFIC PEPTIDES\n\n\nTechnical field The present invention relates to melanocortin receptor-specific cyclic peptides which may be used in the treatment of melanocortin receptor-mediated diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes, in particular energy homeostasis and metabolism related (e.g. diabetes), food intake related and/or energy balance and body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including obesity, overweight and diseases, disorders and/or conditions associated with obesity and/or overweight, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Background\n\n\nThe following discussion refers to a number of publications by author(s) and year of publication, and that due to recent publication dates certain publications are not to be considered as prior art vis-a-vis the present invention. Discussion of such publications herein is given for more complete background and is not to be construed as an admission that such publications are prior art for patentability determination purposes.\n\n\nA family of melanocortin receptor types and subtypes have been identified, including melanocortin- 1 receptors (MCl-R) expressed on normal human melanocytes and melanoma cells, melanocortin-2 receptors (MC2-R) for ACTH (adrenocorticotropin) expressed in cells of the adrenal gland, melanocortin-3 and melanocortin-4 receptors (MC3-R and MC4-R) expressed primarily in cells in the hypothalamus, mid-brain and brainstem, and melanocortin-5 receptors (MC5-R), expressed in a wide distribution of peripheral tissues. MCl-R has been suggested to be associated with hair and skin pigmentation and inflammation, MC2-R is believed to mediate steroidogenesis, MC3-R has been suggested to be associated with energy homeostasis, food intake, and inflammation, MC4-R is believed to control feeding behavior, energy homeostasis, and sexual function (e.g. erectile function), and MC5-R has been suggested to be involved in the exocrine gland system. \n\n Significant work has been done in determining the structure of melanocortin receptors, including both the nucleic acid sequences encoding for the receptors and the amino acid sequences constituting the receptors. MC4-R is a G protein-coupled, 7- transmembrane receptor that is believed to be expressed primarily in the brain. MC4-R inactivation has been shown to result in obesity (Hadley, 1999, Ann N Y\n\n\nAcad ScL, 885:1-21). Agouti-related protein (AgRP) is an endogeneous compound that has been suggested to be a MC antagonist or an inverse agonist on MC4-R. The α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is believed to be the principle endogenous MC4-R agonist. Also peripherally located MC4-R receptors have been suggested to be involved in the control of energy homeostasis, and the role of MC4-R signalling in the vagus nerve and its relevance for treatment of obesity and diabetes is discussed by Gautron et al, The\n\n\nJournal of Comparative Neurology, 518:6-24 (2010).\n\n\nPeptides specific for MC4-R, and secondarily peptides specific for MC3-R, are believed to be useful in regulation of mammalian energy homeostasis, including use as agents for attenuating food intake and body weight gain. MC4-R agonist peptides are believed to be useful for treating sexual dysfunction, including male erectile dysfunction, and for decreasing food intake and body weight gain, such as for treatment of obesity. Such peptides may also be employed for decreasing voluntary ethanol consumption, treatment of drug addictions, and the like. MC4-R agonist peptides, as well as MC3-R agonist peptides, may further be employed for treatment of circulatory shock, ischemia, hemorrhagic shock, inflammatory diseases and related diseases, indications, conditions and syndromes. MC4-R antagonist peptides, by contrast, are believed to be useful for weight gain aid, such as for use in treatment of cachexia, sarcopenia, wasting syndrome or disease, and anorexia. Such peptides may also be employed for treatment of depression and related disorders. (Wikberg et al, Nature Reviews, Drug Discovery, 7, 307, (2008); Adan et al, British J.

Melanocortin receptor-specific peptides include cyclic α-MSH analog peptides such as Ac- Nle-cyc/o(-Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys)-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:1) (See U.S. Patent Nos. \n\n 5,674,839 and 5,576,290) and Ac-Nle-cjc/o(-Asp-His-D-Phe-Arg-Trp-Lys)-OH (SEQ ID NO:2) (See U.S. Patent Nos. 6,579,968 and 6,794,489). These and other melanocortin receptor- specific peptides generally contain the central tetrapeptide sequence of native α- MSH, His\n6\n-Phe\n7\n-Arg\n8\n-Trp\n9\n (SEQ ID NO:3), or a mimetic or variation thereof, including the substitution of D-Phe for Phe\n7\n.

Notwithstanding the intense scientific and pharmaceutical interest in melanocortin receptor-specific peptides, evidenced by numerous articles in the scientific literature and numerous patent applications and issued patents (Nozawa et al, Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 18(4):403-427 (2008); Bednarek et al, Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 14(3):327- 336 (2004); Todorovic et al, Peptides, 26, 2026-2036 (2005); and Ujjainwalla et al, Current Topics in Med. Chem., 7, 1068-1084 (2007)), no melanocortin receptor-specific peptide has been approved as a drug for any therapeutic indication. Indeed, there are no reports of any melanocortin receptor-specific peptide for any therapeutic indication having advanced past Phase II clinical trials. There remains a significant and substantial need for melanocortin receptor- specific peptides for use in pharmaceutical applications.

When reference is made herein to a substituted sulfonamide group, it means that at least one of said organic groups (Ra and Rb) is substituted. The term \"composition\", as in pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from \n\n dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions utilized in the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing an active ingredient and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. By a melanocortin receptor \"agonist\" is meant an endogenous substance, drug substance or compound, including a compound such as the peptides of the present invention, which can interact with a melanocortin receptor and initiate a pharmacological response, including but not limited to adenyl cyclase activation, characteristic of the melanocortin receptor. By \"α-MSH\" is meant the peptide Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-\n\n\nLyS-PrO-VaI-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:4) and analogs and homo logs thereof, including without limitation NDP-α-MSH.\n\n\nBy \"NDP-α-MSH\" is meant the peptide Ac-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Nle-Glu-His-D-Phe-Arg- Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH\n2\n (SEQ ID NO:5) and analogs and homologs thereof. By \"EC\n50\n\" is meant the molar concentration of an agonist, including a partial agonist, which produced 50% of the maximum possible response for that agonist. By way of example, a test compound which, at a concentration of 72 nM, produces 50% of the maximum possible response for that compound as determined in a cAMP assay in an MC4-R cell expression system has an EC50 of 72 nM. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with an EC\n50\n determination is in nanomoles per liter (nM). By \"Ki (nM)\" is meant the equilibrium inhibitor dissociation constant representing the molar concentration of a competing compound that binds to half the binding sites of a receptor at equilibrium in the absence of radioligand or other competitors. In general, the numeric value of the Ki is inversely correlated to the affinity of the compound for the receptor, such that if the Ki is low, the affinity is high. Ki may be determined using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (Cheng Y., Prusoff W. H., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22: 3099-\n\n\n3108, 1973):\n\n\nKi may be expressed in terms of specific receptors (e.g., MCl-R, MC3-R, MC4-R or MC5-R) and specific ligands (e.g. α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH). \n\n By \"inhibition\" is meant the percent attenuation, or decrease in receptor binding, in a competitive inhibition assay compared to a known standard. Thus, by \"inhibition at 1 μM (NDP-α-MSH)\" is meant the percent decrease in binding of NDP-α-MSH by addition of a determined amount of the compound to be tested, such as 1 μM of a test compound, such as under the assay conditions hereafter described. By way of example, a test compound that does not inhibit binding of NDP-α-MSH has a 0% inhibition, and a test compound that completely inhibits binding of NDP-α-MSH has a 100% inhibition. Typically, as described hereafter, a radio assay is used for competitive inhibition testing, such as with I\n125\n-labeled NDP-α-MSH, or a lanthanide chelate fluorescent assay, such as with Eu-NDP-α-MSH. However, other methods of testing competitive inhibition are known, including use of label or tag systems other than radioisotopes, and in general any method known in the art for testing competitive inhibition may be employed in this invention. It may thus be seen that \"inhibition\" is one measure to determine whether a test compound attenuates binding of α-MSH to melanocortin receptors. By \"binding affinity\" is meant the ability of a compound or drug to bind to its biological target, expressed herein as Ki (nM).\n\n\nBy \"intrinsic activity\" is meant the maximal stimulation (functional activity) achievable by a compound in a specified melanocortin receptor expressing cell system, such as the maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. The maximal stimulation achieved by α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH is designated as an intrinsic activity of 1.0 (or 100%) and a compound capable of stimulating half the maximal activity that of α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH is designated as having an intrinsic activity of 0.5 (or 50%). A compound of this invention that under assay conditions described herein has an intrinsic activity of 0.7 (70%) or higher is classified as an agonist, a compound with intrinsic activity between 0.1 (10%) and 0.7 (70%) is classified as a partial agonist, and a compound with intrinsic activity below 0.1 (10%) is classified as inactive or having no intrinsic activity. In one aspect, the cyclic peptides of the present invention may generally be characterized as a partial agonist at MC4-R with respect to α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH.\n\n\nIn general, \"functional activity\" is a measure of the signaling of a receptor, or measure of a change in receptor-associated signaling, such as a melanocortin receptor, and in particular MC4-R or hMC4-R, upon activation by a compound. Melanocortin receptors initiate signal transduction through activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. In one aspect, \n\n melanocortin receptors signal through Gas, which catalyzes production of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase. Thus determination of stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, such as determination of maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, is one measure of functional activity, and is the primary measure exemplified herein. However, it is to be understood that alternative measures of functional activity may be employed in the practice of this invention, and are specifically contemplated and included within the scope of this invention. Thus, in one example intracellular free calcium may be measured, such as reported by and using the methods disclosed in Mountjoy K.G. et al., Melanocortin receptor-medicated mobilization of intracellular free calcium in HEK293 cells. Physiol Genomics 5:11-19, 2001 , or Kassack M.U. et al., Functional screening of G protein- coupled receptors by measuring intracellular calcium with a fluorescence microplate reader. Biomol Screening 7:233-246, 2002. It is also possible to measure activation by measurement of the production of inositol triphosphate or diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, such as by use of radioassays. Yet another measure of functional activity is receptor internalization, resulting from activation of regulatory pathways, such as using the methods disclosed in Nickolls S. A. et al., Functional selectivity of melanocortin 4 receptor peptide and nonpeptide agonists: evidence for ligand specific conformational states. J Pharm Exper Therapeutics 313:1281-1288, 2005. Yet another measure of functional activity is the exchange, and exchange rate, of nucleotides associated with activation of a G protein receptor, such as the exchange of GDP (guanosine diphosphate) for GTP (guanosine triphosphase) on the G protein α subunit, which may be measured by any number of means, including a radioassay using guanosine 5'-(γ- [\n35\nS]thio)-triphosphate, as disclosed in Manning D. R., Measures of efficacy using G proteins as endpoints: differential engagement of G proteins through single receptors. MoI Pharmacol 62:451-452, 2002. Various gene-based assays have been developed for measuring activation of G-coupled proteins, such as those disclosed in Chen W. et al., A colorimetric assay from measuring activation of Gs- and Gq-coupled signaling pathways. Anal Biochem 226:349-354, 1995; Kent T. C. et al., Development of a generic dual-reporter gene assay for screening G-protein-coupled receptors. Biomol Screening, 5 :437-446, 2005; or Kotarsky K. et al., Improved receptor gene assays used to identify ligands acting on orphan seven-transmembrane receptors. Pharmacology & Toxicology 93:249-258, 2003. The colorimetric assay of Chen et al. has been adapted for use in measuring \n\n melanocortin receptor activation, as disclosed in Hruby V.J. et al, Cyclic lactam α- melanocortin analogues of Ac-Nle\n4\n-cyclo[Asp\n5\n,D-Phe\n7\n,Lys\n10]\n α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-(4-l O)-NH\n2\n with bulky aromatic amino acids at position 7 shows high antagonist potency and selectivity at specific melanocortin receptors. J Med Chem 38:3454-3461, 1995. In general, functional activity may be measured by any method, including methods of determining activation and/or signaling of a G-coupled receptor, and further including methods which may be hereafter developed or reported. The terms \"treat,\" \"treating\" and \"treatment,\" as used herein, contemplate an action that occurs while a patient is suffering from the specified disease, disorder and/or condition, which reduces the severity of the disease, disorder and/or condition. Moreover, the terms \"treat,\" \"treating\" and \"treatment,\" as used herein are intended to embrace therapeutic (curative), prophylactic (preventing), controlling and palliative treatment of the indicated diseases, disorders and/or conditions.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"pharmacologically effective amount\" (including \"therapeutically effective amount\") means an amount of a peptide according to the invention that is sufficient to induce a desired therapeutic or biological effect.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"therapeutically effective amount\" means the amount of a peptide of the invention that will elicit a biological or medical response in the mammal that is being treated by a medical doctor or other clinician.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term \"prophylactically effective\" or \"preventive\" means the amount of a peptide of the invention that will prevent or inhibit affliction or mitigate affliction of a mammal with a medical condition that a medical doctor or other clinician is trying to prevent, inhibit, or mitigate before a patient begins to suffer from the specified disease or disorder.\n\n\nThe term \"diabetes\" includes Type 1 Diabetes, which is insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as diagnosed according to criteria published in the Report of the Expert\n\n\nCommittee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus {Diabetes Care, Vol. 24, Supp. 1, January 2001) whereby fasting plasma glucose level is greater than or equal to 126 milligrams per deciliter and for which the primary cause is pancreatic beta cell destruction, Type 2 Diabetes, which is non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as diagnosed according to criteria published in the Report of the Expert Committee on the \n\n Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus whereby fasting plasma glucose level is greater than or equal to 126 milligrams per deciliter, and latent autoimmune diabetes mellitus of adults (LADA).\n\n\nThe term \"metabolic syndrome\" refers to metabolic disorders, particularly glucose and lipid regulatory disorders, including insulin resistance and defective secretion of insulin by pancreatic beta cells, and may further include conditions and states such as abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, glucose intolerance or a prothrombitic state, and which may further result in disorders such as hyperlipidemia, obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. 2.0 Clinical Indications and Utility.\n\n\nThe compositions and methods disclosed herein can be used for both medical applications and animal husbandry or veterinary applications. Typically, the methods are used in humans, but may also be used in other mammals. The term \"patient\" is intended to denote a mammalian individual, and is so used throughout the specification and in the claims. The primary applications of the present invention involve human patients, but the present invention may be applied to laboratory, farm, zoo, wildlife, pet, sport or other animals. Clinical indications and specific utilities include the following: 2.1 Obesity and Related Metabolic Syndrome. Peptides of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), have been found to be ligands of the MC4 receptor. In particular, peptides of Formula (I) are believed to be useful in treating diseases, disorders and/or conditions responsive to modulation of the MC4-R function, more particularly activation of the MC4-R, i.e. diseases, disorders and/or conditions which would benefit from agonism (including full or partial agonism) at the MC4-R, including energy homeostasis and metabolism related (such as diabetes, in particular type 2 diabetes; dyslipidemia; fatty liver; hypercholesterolemia; hypertriglyceridemia; hyperuricacidemia; impaired glucose tolerance; impaired fasting glucos; insulin resistance syndrome; and metabolic syndrome), food intake related (such as hyperphagia; binge eating; bulimia; and compulsive eating) and/or energy balance and body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions, more particularly such diseases, disorders and conditions characterized by excess body weight and/or excess food intake. \n\n Peptides of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), are particularly believed to be useful for treatment of body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions characterized by excess body weight, including obesity and overweight (by promotion of weight loss, maintenance of weight loss, and/or prevention of weight gain, including medication- induced weight gain or weight gain subsequent to cessation of smoking), and diseases, disorders and/or conditions associated with obesity and/or overweight, such as insulin resistance; impaired glucose tolerance; type 2 diabetes; metabolic syndrome; dyslipidemia (including hyperlipidemia); hypertension; heart disorders (e.g. coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction); cardiovascular disorders; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis); joint disorders (including secondary osteoarthritis); gastroesophageal reflux; sleep apnea; atherosclerosis; stroke; macro and micro vascular diseases; steatosis (e.g. in the liver); gall stones; and gallbladder disorders.\n\n\nPeptides of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), are particularly believed to be useful for treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes, more specifically obesity.\n\n\nIt will be understood that there are medically accepted definitions of obesity and overweight. A patient may be identified by, for example, measuring body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared, and comparing the result with the definitions. The recommended classifications for BMI in humans, adopted by the Expert Panel on the Identification, Evaluation and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults, and endorsed by leading organizations of health professionals, are as follows: underweight < 18.5 kg/m\n2\n, normal weight 18.5-24.9 kg/m\n2\n, overweight 25-29.9 kg/m\n2\n, obesity (class 1) 30-34.9 kg/m\n2\n, obesity (class 2) 35-39.9 kg/m\n2\n, extreme obesity (class 3) > 40 kg/m\n2\n (Practical Guide to the Identification,\n\n\nEvaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults, The North American Association for the Study of Obesity (NAASO) and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) 2000). Modifications of this classification may be used for specific ethnic groups and for children. Another alternative for assessing overweight and obesity is by measuring waist circumference. There are several proposed classifications and differences in the cutoffs based on ethnic group. For instance, according to the \n\n classification from the International Diabetes Federation, men having waist circumferences above 94 cm (cut off for europids) and women having waist circumferences above 80 cm (cut off for europids) are at higher risk of diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases because of excess abdominal fat. Another classification is based on the recommendation from the Adult Treatment Panel III where the recommended cutoffs are 102 cm for men and 88 cm for women. However, the peptides of Formula (I) may also be used for reduction of self-diagnosed overweight and for decreasing the risk of becoming obese due to life style, genetic considerations, heredity and/or other factors. It is believed that peptides of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), upon administration to an animal, including man, will reduce food intake, body weight and/or body weight gain in that animal.\n\n\nWithout being bound by any theory, it is believed that peptides of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), act by modulating appetite and/or satiety, increasing metabolic rate, reducing intake of and/or craving for fat and/or carbohydrates. Without being bound by any theory, it is also believed that peptides of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), act by enhancing glucose tolerance and/or decreasing insulin resistance. It is therefore believed that peptides of Formula (I) can be useful also for treatment of type 2 diabetes in underweight and normal weight individuals as well as in overweight and obese individuals. Peptides of the invention might also be useful for (i) prevention of organ or tissue damage caused by hypoperfusion due to vessel occlusion (e.g. caused by thrombosis), haemorrhage, trauma, surgery, haemorrhagic shock, cardiogenic shock, toxic shock or septic shock or (iii) treatment of male and female sexual dysfunctions, such as male erectile dysfunction or female sexual arousal dysfunction. According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a peptide of\n\n\nFormula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), as previously defined for use as a medicament.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the invention provides the use of a peptide of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), for treatment of diseases, disorders and/or conditions responsive to modulation of the MC4-R, such as diseases, disorders and/or conditions responsive to activation of the MC4-R, in particular energy homeostasis and metabolism related (e.g. diabetes), food intake related and/or energy balance and body weight related \n\n diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including obesity, overweight and diseases, disorders and/or conditions associated with obesity and/or overweight, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.\n\n\nIn a further aspect, the invention provides the use of a peptide of Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), in the preparation of a medicament for treatment of diseases, disorders and/or conditions responsive to modulation of the MC4-R, such as activation of the MC4-R, in particular energy homeostasis and metabolism related (e.g. diabetes), food intake related and/or energy balance and body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including obesity, overweight and diseases, disorders and/or conditions associated with obesity and/or overweight, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome.\n\n\nPeptides of the invention are advantageously more selective (i.e. higher affinity and/or higher specificity) for MC4-R and/or MC3-R than for MCl-R, MC2-R and MC5-R, in particular MCl-R. In particular, peptides of the invention are advantageously more selective for MC4-R than for any of MC3-R and MCl-R. Peptides of the invention are suitably at least 3-fold, in particular 10-fold, more particularly 30-fold, more selective for MC4-R than for any of MCl-R, MC2-R, MC3-R and MC5-R. Some peptides of the invention are even more than 100-fold, such as even about 150-fold, more selective for MC4-R than MCl-R as determined in the receptor binding assay described in 7.1.

Any of a number of well- known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the peptides of the present invention.\n\n\nThe cyclic peptides of the present invention may be readily synthesized by known conventional procedures for the formation of a peptide linkage between amino acids. Such conventional procedures include, for example, any solution phase procedure permitting a condensation between the free alpha amino group of an amino acid or residue thereof having its carboxyl group and other reactive groups protected and the free primary carboxyl group of another amino acid or residue thereof having its amino group or other reactive groups protected. In a preferred conventional procedure, the cyclic peptides of the present invention may be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and purified according to methods known in the art. Any of a number of well-known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the peptides of the present invention. \n\n The process for synthesizing the cyclic peptides may be carried out by a procedure whereby each amino acid in the desired sequence is added one at a time in succession to another amino acid or residue thereof or by a procedure whereby peptide fragments with the desired amino acid sequence are first synthesized conventionally and then condensed to provide the desired peptide. The resulting peptide is then cyclized to yield a cyclic peptide of the invention.\n\n\nSolid phase peptide synthesis methods are well known and practiced in the art. In such methods the synthesis of peptides of the invention can be carried out by sequentially incorporating the desired amino acid residues one at a time into the growing peptide chain according to the general principles of solid phase methods. These methods are disclosed in numerous references, including Merrifield, R.B., Solid phase synthesis (Nobel lecture). Angew Chem 24:799-810 (1985) and Barany et al., The Peptides, Analysis, Synthesis and Biology, Vol. 2, Gross, E. and Meienhofer, J., Eds. Academic Press 1-284 (1980).\n\n\nIn chemical syntheses of peptides, reactive side chain groups of the various amino acid residues are protected with suitable protecting groups, which prevent a chemical reaction from occurring at that site until the protecting group is removed. Also common is the protection of the alpha amino group of an amino acid residue or fragment while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the alpha amino protecting group to allow a subsequent reaction to take place at that site. Specific protecting groups have been disclosed and are known in solid phase synthesis methods and solution phase synthesis methods.\n\n\nAlpha amino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, including a urethane-type protecting group, such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, such as p-chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p- bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-biphenyl-isopropoxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Moz) and aliphatic urethane-type protecting groups, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc). Fmoc are preferred for alpha amino protection. Guanidino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, such as nitro, p- toluenesulfonyl (Tos), Z, pentamethylchromanesulfonyl (Pmc), adamantyloxycarbonyl, \n\n pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Pbf) and Boc. Pbf and Pmc are preferred protecting groups for Arg.\n\n\nThe peptides of the invention described herein were prepared using solid phase synthesis, such as by means of a Symphony Multiplex Peptide Synthesizer (Rainin Instrument Company/Protein Technologies Inc) automated peptide synthesizer, using programming modules as provided by the manufacturer and following the protocols set forth in the manufacturer's manual.\n\n\nSolid phase synthesis is commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha amino acid to a suitable resin. Such starting material is prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid by an amide linkage to a 4-(2', 4'-dimethoxylphenyl-aminomethyl-phenoxy (Rink Amide) resin, a 4-(2', 4'- dimethoxylphenyl-aminomethyl)-phenoxyacetamido-norleucyl-MBHA resin, an amino- xanthen-3-yloxy-merifϊel resin (Sieber Amide) resin, or by an ester linkage to a p- benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin, a 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin or by other means well known in the art. Fmoc-Linker-BHA resin supports are commercially available and generally used when feasible. The resins are carried through repetitive cycles as necessary to add amino acids sequentially. The alpha amino Fmoc protecting groups are removed under basic conditions. Piperidine, piperazine, diethylamine, or morpholine (20-40% v/v) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) may be used for this purpose. Following removal of the alpha amino protecting group, the subsequent protected amino acids are coupled stepwise in the desired order to obtain an intermediate, protected peptide-resin. The activating reagents used for coupling of the amino acids in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the art. After the peptide is synthesized, if desired, the orthogonally protected side chain protecting groups may be removed using methods well known in the art for further derivatization of the peptide.\n\n\nTypically, orthogonal protecting groups are used as appropriate. For example, the peptides of the invention contain multiple amino acids with an amino group-containing side chain. In one aspect, an Allyl-Alloc protection scheme is employed with the amino acids forming a lactam bridge through their side chains, and orthogonal protecting groups, cleavable under different reactive conditions, use for other amino acids with amino group- containing side chains. Thus, for example, Fmoc-Orn(Alloc)-OH and Fmoc-Glu(OAll)- OH amino acids (GIu(OAIl) refers to glutamic acid 5-allyl ester) can be employed for the \n\n positions forming a lactam bridge upon cyclization, while other amino acids with amino group-containing side chains have a different and orthogonal protecting group, such as with Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-Lys(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-Dab(Pbf)-OH or the like. Other protecting groups may be similarly employed; by way of example and not limitation, Mtt/OPp (4-methyltrityl/ 2-phenylisopropyl) can be employed with the side chains forming a lactam bridge upon cyclization, with orthogonal protecting groups being utilized for other positions that are not cleavable using conditions suitable for cleavage of Mtt/OPp.\n\n\nReactive groups in a peptide can be selectively modified, either during solid phase synthesis or after removal from the resin. For example, peptides can be modified to obtain N-terminus modifications, such as acetylation, while on resin, or may be removed from the resin by use of a cleaving reagent and then modified. Similarly, methods for modifying side chains of amino acids are well known to those skilled in the art of peptide synthesis. The choice of modifications made to reactive groups present on the peptide will be determined, in part, by the characteristics that are desired in the peptide. In the peptides of the present invention, in one embodiment the N-terminus group is modified by introduction of an N-acetyl group. In one aspect, a method is employed wherein after removal of the protecting group at the N-terminal, the resin-bound peptide is reacted with acetic anhydride in DMF in the presence of an organic base, such aspyridine. Other methods of N-terminus acetylation are known in the art, including solution phase acetylation, and may be employed.\n\n\nThe peptide can, in one embodiment, be cyclized prior to cleavage from the peptide resin. For cyclization through reactive side chain moieties, the desired side chains are deprotected, and the peptide suspended in a suitable solvent and a cyclic coupling agent added. Suitable solvents include, for example DMF, dichloromethane (DCM) or 1-methyl- 2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Suitable cyclic coupling reagents include, for example, 2-(1H- benzotriazol-l-yl)-l,l,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 2-(1H- benzotriazol- 1 -yl)- 1 , 1 ,3 ,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), benzotriazole- 1 -yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (BOP), benzotriazole- 1 -yl-oxy-tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), 2-(7- aza-lH-benzotriazol-l-yl)-l,l,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TATU), 2-(2- oxo-l(2H)-pyridyl)-l,l,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TPTU) or N\n5\nN'- dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole (DCCI/HOBt). Coupling is \n\n conventionally initiated by use of a suitable base, such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), sym-collidine or N-methylmorpholine (NMM).\n\n\nThe cyclized peptides can then be cleaved from solid phase, using any suitable reagent, such as ethylamine in DCM or various combinations of agents, such as trifluoro acetic acid (TFA), tri-isopropylsilane (TIS), dimethoxybenezene (DMB), water and the like. The resulting crude peptide is dried and remaining amino acid side chain protecting groups, if any, are cleaved using any suitable reagent, such as TFA in the presence of water, TIS, 2-mercaptopethane (ME), and/or 1 ,2-ethanedithiol (EDT). The final product is precipitated by adding cold ether and collected by filtration. Final purification is by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), using a suitable column, such as a Ci 8 column, or other methods of separation or purification, such as methods based on the size or charge of the peptide, can also be employed. Once purified, the peptide can be characterized by any number of methods, such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and the like.\n\n\nFor peptides of the present invention which have a C-terminus substituted amide derivative or N-alkyl group, synthesis may proceed by solid phase synthesis commenced from the C-terminal end of the peptide by coupling a protected alpha amino acid to a suitable resin. Such methods for preparing substituted amide derivatives on solid-phase have been described in the art. See, for example, Barn D.R. et al., Synthesis of an array of amides by aluminum chloride assisted cleavage on resin bound esters. Tetrahedron Letters, 37:3213-3216 (1996); DeGrado W.F. and Kaiser E.T., Solid-phase synthesis of protected peptides on a polymer bound oxime: Preparation of segments comprising the sequences of a cytotoxic 26-peptide analogue. J. Org. Chem., 47:3258-3261 (1982). Such a starting material can be prepared by attaching an alpha amino -protected amino acid by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin or an by amide linkage to a 4-(2', 4'- dimethoxylphenyl-aminomethyl-phenoxy (Rink Amide) resin by well known means. The peptide chain is grown with the desired sequence of amino acids. Before cleavage, the peptide is cyclized on the solid phase. Peptides employing a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin may be cleaved from resin by aluminum chloride in DCM, and peptides employing a Rink Amide resin may be cleaved by mixture of TFA, TIS and water. \n\n While synthesis has been described primarily with reference to solid phase Fmoc chemistry, it is to be understood that other chemistries and synthetic methods may be employed to make the cyclic peptides of the invention, such as by way of example and not limitation, methods employing Boc chemistry, solution chemistry, and other chemistries and synthetic methods.\n\n\n5.1 Salt Form of Cyclic Peptides of the Present Invention.

It is also to be understood that certain peptides of the Formula (I) can exist in solvated forms, including solvates of the free peptide or solvates of a salt of the compound, as well as unsolvated forms. The term \"solvate\" is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term \"hydrate\" is employed when said solvent is water.lt is to be understood that all polymorphs, including mixtures of different polymorphs, are included within the scope of the claimed peptides. 5.2 Pharmaceutical Compositions.\n\n\nThe invention provides a pharmaceutical composition that includes one or more cyclic peptides of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. When formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, the compound of the invention may be present in the pharmaceutical composition in a concentration from 0.1 to 99.5%, such as from 0.5 to 95%, by weight of the total composition. The choice of carrier is within the knowledge of a person skilled in the art and depends on, for instance, the mode of administration, the dosage form, and the physical properties of the active compound, such as solubility and stability. The term \"carrier\" as used herein relates to a therapeutically inactive ingredient. The dosage form may be a solid, semi-solid or liquid system. The formulation may be an immediate and/or modified release, including delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release formulation.\n\n\nThe carrier may be a liquid formulation, and is preferably a buffered, isotonic, aqueous solution. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers also include excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as hereafter described. \n\n The cyclic peptide compositions of the present invention may be formulated or compounded into pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one cyclic peptide of the present invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, including excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as may be desired. Formulation excipients may include polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, hydroxy propyl cellulose (HPC), acacia, polyethylene glycol, mannitol, sodium chloride and sodium citrate. For injection or other liquid administration formulations, water containing at least one or more buffering constituents is preferred, and stabilizing agents, preservatives and solubilizing agents may also be employed. For solid administration formulations, any of a variety of thickening, filler, bulking and carrier additives may be employed, such as starches, sugars, cellulose derivatives, fatty acids and the like. For topical administration formulations, any of a variety of creams, ointments, gels, lotions and the like may be employed. For most pharmaceutical formulations, non-active ingredients will constitute the greater part, by weight or volume, of the preparation. For pharmaceutical formulations, it is also contemplated that any of a variety of measured-release, slow-release or sustained- release formulations and additives may be employed, so that the dosage may be formulated so as to provide delivery of a peptide of the present invention over a period of time. In general, the actual quantity of cyclic peptides of the present invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending on the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired.\n\n\nIn practical use, the cyclic peptides of the invention can be combined as the active ingredient in an admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, for example, oral, parenteral (including intravenous), urethral, vaginal, nasal, buccal, sublingual, or the like. In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating \n\n agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets.\n\n\nBecause of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent an advantageous oral dosage unit form. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or non-aqueous techniques. The amount of active peptide in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. In another dosage unit form, sublingual constructs may be employed, such as sheets, wafers, tablets or the like.\n\n\nThe tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as povidone, gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; diluents; fillers such as microcrystalline cellulose; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch or alginic acid; preservatives; colorants; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as fatty oil. Various other materials may be utilized as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.\n\n\nIf formulated for oral delivery, the peptide is preferably formulated and made such that it is encased in an enteric protectant, more preferably such that it is not released until the tablet or capsule has transited the stomach, and optionally has further transited a portion of the small intestine. In the context of this application it will be understood that the term enteric coating or material refers to a coating or material that will pass through the stomach essentially intact but will disintegrate after passing through the stomach to release the active drug substance. Materials that may be used includes cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl-ethylcellulose succinate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, and methacrylic acid-methyl methacrylate copolymer. The enteric coating employed promotes dissolution of the dosage form primarily at a site outside the stomach, and may be selected such that the enteric coating dissolves at a pH of approximately at least 5.5, more preferable at a pH of from about 6.0 to about 8.0.\n\n\nAny of a variety of permeation enhancers may be employed, to increase uptake in the intestines upon dissolution of the enteric coating. In one aspect, permeation enhancers \n\n increase either paracellular or transcellular transport systems. Representative, non-limiting examples of such permeation enhancers include calcium chelators, bile salts (such as sodium cholate), and fatty acids. In some embodiments, peptides or polypeptides that act as substrates for intestinal proteases are further added. Cyclic peptides may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active peptides may for instance be prepared in water mixed with for instance hydroxy-propylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. These preparations may optionally contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that it may be administered by syringe. The form must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol, for example glycerol, propylene glycol or liquid polyethylene glycol, suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.\n\n\nThe cyclic peptides of the present invention may be therapeutically applied by means of nasal administration. By \"nasal administration\" is meant any form of intranasal administration of any of the cyclic peptides of the present invention. The peptides may be in an aqueous solution, such as a solution including saline, citrate or other common excipients or preservatives. The peptides may also be in a dry or powder formulation. If in an aqueous solution, the cyclic peptides may be appropriately buffered by means of saline, acetate, phosphate, citrate, acetate or other buffering agents, which may be at any physiologically acceptable pH, such as from about pH 4 to about pH 7. A combination of buffering agents may also be employed, such as phosphate buffered saline, a saline and acetate buffer, and the like. In the case of saline, a 0.9% saline solution may be employed. In the case of acetate, phosphate, citrate, and the like, a 50 mM solution may be employed. In addition to buffering agents, a suitable preservative may be employed, to prevent or limit bacteria and other microbial growth. One such preservative that may be employed is 0.05% benzalkonium chloride. \n\n In an alternative embodiment, cyclic peptides of the present invention may be administered directly into the lung. Intrapulmonary administration may be performed by means of a metered dose inhaler, a device allowing self-administration of a metered bolus of a peptide of the present invention when actuated by a patient during inspiration. Any of a variety of different techniques may be used to make dry powder microparticles, including but not limited to micro-milling, spray drying and a quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization.\n\n\nThe cyclic peptides of the present invention may be therapeutically administered by means of an injection of a sustained release formulation. In general, any of a number of injectable and bioerodible polymers may be employed in a sustained release injectable formulation. Alternatively other sustained release formulations may be employed, including formulations permitting subcutaneous injection, which other formulations may include one or more of nano/microspheres, liposomes, emulsions (such as water-in-oil emulsions), gels, insoluble salts or suspensions in oil The formulation may be such that an injection is required on a daily, weekly, monthly or other periodic basis, depending on the concentration and amount of cyclic peptide, the sustained release rate of the materials employed, and other factors known to those of skill in the art. 5.3 Routes of Administration. If a composition including one or more peptides of the present invention is administered by injection, the injection may be intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or other means known in the art.\n\n\nThe peptides of the present invention may be formulated by any means known in the art, including but not limited to formulation as tablets, capsules, caplets, suspensions, powders, lyophilized preparations, suppositories, ocular drops, skin patches, oral soluble formulations, sprays, aerosols and the like, and may be mixed and formulated with buffers, binders, excipients, stabilizers, anti-oxidants and other agents known in the art. In general, any route of administration by which the peptides of invention are introduced across an epidermal layer of cells may be employed. Administration means may thus include administration through mucous membranes, buccal administration, oral administration, dermal administration, inhalation administration, nasal administration, urethral administration, vaginal administration, and the like. \n\n 5.4 Therapeutically Effective Amount.\n\n\nIn general, the actual quantity of cyclic peptide of the present invention administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending upon the mode of administration, the patient (including weight, sex, health condition and diet), the formulation used, and the response desired. The dosage for treatment is administration, by any of the foregoing means or any other means known in the art, of an amount sufficient to bring about the desired therapeutic effect. The cyclic peptides of the present invention are highly active. For example, the cyclic peptide can be administered (as a single dose or in divided daily doses) at about 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 50, 100, 500, 1000 or 5000 μg/kg body weight, depending on the specific peptide selected, the desired therapeutic response, the route of administration, the formulation and other factors known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n6.0 Peptides of the Present Invention.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention relates to a cyclic peptide of the structural Formula (I):\n\n\n \n\n including all enantiomers, stereoisomers or diastereoisomers thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of any of the foregoing, wherein:\n\n\nRi is -NH-C(=O)- or -C(=O)-NH-;\n\n\nR\n2\n is -H or -CH\n2\n-, and if R\n2\n is -CH\n2\n- forms with R3 a pyrrolidine ring, the pyrrolidine ring optionally substituted with -OH; \n\n R-3 is -(CH\n2\n)\n2\n- if R\n2\n is -CH\n2\n-, and otherwise R3 is selected from \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR\n4\nE\n1\n, R\n4\nI, and R\n4\nC are each independently selected from hydrogen, halo, (C\n1\n- Cio)alkyl-halo, (Ci-Cio)alkyl-dihalo, (Ci-Cio)alkyl-trihalo, (Ci-Cio)alkyl, (Ci-Cio)alkoxy, (Ci-Cio)alkylthio, aryl, aryloxy, nitro, nitrile, sulfonamide, amino, monosubstituted amino, disubstituted amino, hydroxy, carboxy, or alkoxy-carbonyl, on the proviso that at least one OfR\n4\nJ\n1\n, R\n4\nb and R\n40\n is not hydrogen;\n\n\nR\n5\n is -OH or -N(R6a)(R6b);\n\n\nRδa and Rδb are each independently H or a Ci to C\n4\n linear, branched or cyclic alkyl chain;\n\n\nR\n7\n is -H or -C(=O)-NH\n2\n; w is in each instance independently O to 5; x is 1 to 5; y is 1 to 5; and z is in each instance independently 1 to 5.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention relates to a cyclic peptide of Formula (I) which is of formula (II): \n\n \n\n\n or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention relates to a cyclic peptide of Formula (I) which is of Formula (III):\n\n\n \n\n or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\nIn one aspect, the invention provides a cyclic heptapeptide which contains a core sequence derived from His-Phe-Arg-Trp within the cyclic portion, and where the amino \n\n acid in the first position is Arg and is outside the cyclic portion. Without being bound by any theory, the Arg residue is believed to largely contribute to the low activity at MCl-R.\n\n\nFurther, the core sequence in the peptides of Formula I includes a substituted D-Phe. Without being bound by any theory, it is believed that the intrinsic activity may be lowered while substantially maintaining potency by using substituted D-Phe in peptides in accordance with the invention. The peptide called Ref Ex 1 (including unsubstituted D- Phe) in Table 1 can be compared with one or more of Examples 1-5, 9-11, 17, 26 and 27. It may be noted that Table 1 includes mean values.\n\n\nTable 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a further embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein one or more of R\n4a\n, R\n4I\n, and R\n4C\n are each independently selected from hydrogen, halo, (Ci-Cio)alkyl-halo, (Ci-Cio)alkyl- dihalo, (Ci-Cio)alkyl-trihalo, (Ci-Cio)alkyl, (Ci-Cio)alkoxy, phenyl, nitro, nitrile, amino or hydroxy, on the proviso that at least one of R4\na\n, R\n4\nI, and R\n4\nC is not hydrogen.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein one or more of R\n4\n^ R\n4b\n and R\n40\n are each independently selected from hydrogen, halo, (Ci-C\n4\n)alkyl-halo, (Ci-C\n4\n)alkyl- dihalo, (Ci-C4)alkyl-trihalo, (Ci-C4)alkyl, (Ci-C4)alkoxy, phenyl, nitro, nitrile, amino or hydroxy, on the proviso that at least one of R4\na\n, R4b and R4\nC\n is not hydrogen.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein one or more of R\n4a\n, R\n4b\n and R\n4C\n are each independently selected from fluoro, chloro, OH \n\n -CH, — O— CH, \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\" NH2\n . -^ or \n/\n^N\n\n\nIn a further embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein one or more of IW, IW and R\n4C\n are each independently selected from hydrogen, halo, (Ci-C\n4\n)alkyl-halo, (Ci-C\n4\n)alkyl- dihalo, (Ci-C4)alkyl-trihalo, (Ci-C4)alkyl, (Ci-C4)alkoxy, nitro, nitrile, amino or hydroxy, on the proviso that at least one of IW, IW and IW is not hydrogen.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein one or more of IW, IW and IW are each independently selected from fluoro, chloro, OH \n;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-NO\n2\n /^N λ or \nN\n In a further embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to\n\n\nFormula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein IW, is selected from fluoro, chloro, \nOH\n \ns\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-NO\n2 /\n^%\nN\n \n\n\n^ or \nN\n ; and R4b and IW are each H.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein IW is selected from -C≡N or \n\n -F, and R4b and R\n4\nC are each H.\n\n\nIn a particular embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein R\n4J1\n is in the 4 position and is -C≡N and R4b and R\n4\nC are each H. In another particular embodiment of the invention, there are provided peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), wherein R\n4J1\n is in the 4 position and is -F and R4b and R\n40\n are each H.\n\n\nThe peptides encompassed within Formula (I) contain one or more asymmetric elements such as stereogenic centers, stereogenic axes and the like, so that the peptides encompassed within Formula (I) can exist in different stereoisomeric forms. For both specific and generically described peptides, including the peptides encompassed within Formula (I), all forms of isomers at all chiral or other isomeric centers, including enantiomers and diastereomers, are intended to be covered herein. The peptides of the invention each include multiple chiral centers, and may be used as a racemic mixture or an enantiomerically enriched mixture, in addition to use of the peptides of the invention in enantiopure preparations. Typically, the peptides of the invention will be synthesized with the use of chirally pure reagents, such as specified L- or D-amino acids, using reagents, conditions and methods such that enantiomeric purity is maintained, but it is possible and contemplated that racemic mixtures may be made. Such racemic mixtures may optionally be separated using well-known techniques and an individual enantiomer may be used alone. In cases and under specific conditions of temperature, solvents and pH wherein peptides may exist in tautomeric forms, each tautomeric form is contemplated as being included within this invention whether existing in equilibrium or predominantly in one form. Thus a single enantiomer of a peptide of Formula (I), which is an optically active form, can be obtained by asymmetric synthesis, synthesis from optically pure precursors, or by resolution of the racemates.\n\n\nThe peptides of formulas (II) and (III) are specific stereoisomeric forms of the peptides of Formula (I), but the invention should not be construed as being limited to the stereoisomeric forms encompassed by formulas (II) and (III). The invention is further intended to include prodrugs of the present peptides, which on administration undergo chemical conversion by metabolic processes before becoming active pharmacological peptides. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of \n\n the present peptides, which are readily convertible in vivo into a peptide of Formula (I). Prodrugs are any covalently bonded compounds, which release the active parent peptide drug of Formula (I) in vivo. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in \"Design of Prodrugs\", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985. Typical examples of prodrugs have biologically labile protecting groups on a functional moiety, such as for example by esterification of hydroxyl, carboxyl or amino functions. Thus by way of example and not limitation, a prodrug includes peptides of Formula (I) wherein an ester prodrug form is employed, such as, for example, lower alkyl esters of the R group of Formula (I), such as where R is -OH, which lower alkyl esters may include from 1-8 carbons in an alkyl radical or aralkyl esters which have 6-12 carbons in an aralkyl radical. Broadly speaking, prodrugs include compounds that can be oxidized, reduced, aminated, deaminated, hydroxylated, dehydroxylated, hydrolyzed, dehydrolyzed, alkylated, dealkylated, acylated, deacylated, phosphorylated or dephosphorylated to produce an active parent peptide drug of Formula (I) in vivo.\n\n\nCertain modifications of peptides of Formula I may be made in order to enhance the half-life of the peptide (see G. Pasuta and F. M. Veronese (2007) \"Polymer-drug conjugation, recent achievements and general strategies\" Progress in Polymer Science 32 (8-9): 933-961). The subject invention also includes peptides which are identical to those recited in\n\n\nFormula (I), but for the fact that one or more atoms depicted in Formula (I) are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into peptides of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO and \n17\nO, respectively. Peptides of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvates of said peptides which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labeled peptides of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as \n3\nH and \n14\nC are incorporated, may have use in a variety of assays, such as in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Substitution with heavier isotopes, such as substitution of one or more hydrogen atoms with deuterium (\n2\nH), can provide pharmacological advantages in some instances, including increased \n\n metabolic stability. Isotopically labeled peptides of Formula (I) can generally be prepared by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. In one embodiment of the peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), R\n1\n is -C(=O)-NH-, x is 2 and y is 3. In another embodiment of the peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular\n\n\nFormula (II) or (III), R\n1\n is -C(=O)-NH-, x is 1 and y is 4.\n\n\nIn another embodiment of the peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), R\n1\n is -NH-C(=O)-, x is 3 and y is 2.\n\n\nIn still another embodiment of the peptides according to the Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), R\n1\n is -NH-C(=O)-, x is 4 and y is 1.\n\n\nIn a particular embodiment of the peptides according to the Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), R\n1\n is -C(=O)-NH-, x is 2 and y is 3, or alternatively R\n1\n is -NH-C(=O)-, x is 3 and y is 2. More specifically, R\n1\n is -C(=O)-NH-, x is 2 and y is 3. It has surprisingly and unexpectedly been found that peptides according to the invention having a lactam bridge wherein the amide bond is positioned by means of the side chain of GIu (at the N-terminus end of the cyclic portion) and the side chain of Orn (at the C-terminus end of the cyclic portion) generally provides improved potency as determined by EC50, in particular in the herein described low density hMC4-R system, compared to peptides wherein the amide bond is positioned by means of the side chains of Asp and Lys, but which are otherwise identical. This discovery is contrary to assertions in the prior art that the location and direction of an amide bond in the lactam bridge of melanocortin receptor specific peptides is of little importance for activity and does not interact with receptors. See, for example, Bednarek MA et al, Potent and selective peptide agonists of α- melanotropin action at human melanocortin receptor 4: their synthesis and biological evaluation in vitro. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 286:641-645 (2001).\n\n\nIn an embodiment of the peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), R\n2\n is -H or -CH\n2\n-, and if R\n2\n is -CH\n2\n- forms with R3 a pyrrolidine ring, the pyrrolidine ring optionally substituted with -OH;\n\n\nR3 is -(CH\n2\n)\n2\n- if R\n2\n is -CH\n2\n-, and otherwise R3 is selected from\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein w is in each instance independently selected from O to 5, and z is in each instance independently selected from 1 to 5.\n\n\nIn an embodiment of the peptides according to Formula (I), and in particular Formula (II) or (III), R\n2\n is -H or -CH\n2\n-, and if R\n2\n is -CH\n2\n- forms with R3 a pyrrolidine ring, the pyrrolidine ring optionally substituted with -OH;\n\n\nR3 is -(CH\n2\n)\n2\n- if R\n2\n is -CH\n2\n-, and otherwise R3 is selected from\n\n\n \n\n wherein w is in each instance independently selected from O to 5, and \n\n z is in each instance independently selected from 1 to 5.

All peptides were prepared in the TFA acid salt form, except for the peptides of Examples 43, 46 and 67, which were prepared in the acetate salt form.\n\n\nThe syntheses of some specific peptides of the invention are illustrated below. These peptides were prepared using solid phase peptide synthesis by means of a Symphony Multiplex Peptide Synthesizer (Rainin Instrument Company/Protein Technologies Inc) automated peptide synthesizer. Step 1 : Coupling of Orn\n\n\nThe Sierber resin 9-Fmoc-Aminoxanthen-3-yloxy-polystyrene resin (0.39 mol/g,ChemPep Inc. ,#151902) was swelled in 3 x 5 mL of DMF for 10 min. Thereafter, Fmoc was deprotected using 2 x 5 mL of 20% piperidine in DMF for 10 min. The resin was then washed in 6 x 5 mL DMF for 30 sec. 5 mL of 200 mM Fmoc-Orn(Alloc)-OH in DMF and 5 mL 200 mM HBTU containing 400 mM NMM in DMF was added and after 30 min the resin was washed with 3 x 5 mL DMF for 30 sec. \n\n Step 2: Coupling of next 6 amino acids (AA)\n\n\nThe resin from step 1 was first swelled in 3 x 5 mL of DMF for 30 sec, Fmoc was deprotected using 2 x 5 mL of 20% piperidine in DMF for 10 min and then washed with 6 x 5 mL DMF for 30 sec. 5 mL of 200 mM Fmoc- AA-OH solution and 5 mL 200 mM HBTU containing 400 mM NMM in DMF was added and after 30 min the resin was washed with 3 x 5 mL DMF for 30 sec.\n\n\nThis step was repeated for each amino acid (AA). Step 3 : Acetylation\n\n\nFmoc was deprotected using 2 x 5 mL of 20% piperidine in DMF for 10 min and the resin was then washed with 3 x 5 mL DMF for 30 sec. Thereafter, 5 mL of 50%\n\n\nAc\n2\nCVDMF solution was added and after 30 min the peptide resin was washed with 3 x 5 mL DMF for 30 sec and 6 x 5 mL DCM for 30 sec. Step 4: AUyI/ Alloc Deprotection\n\n\nThe peptide resin (0.6 mmol) was mixed with phenylsilane (Oakwood Chemical, #S13600) (20 eq.) in 20 mL of DCM and bubbled with nitrogen for 5 min.\n\n\nTetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0) (Strem Chemicals, Inc., #46-2150) (0.2 eq.) was added and the mixture was agitated with nitrogen for 1 hour. The procedure was repeated one time for 1 hour and an additional time for 30 min with fresh reagents. The treated peptide resin was then washed with DCM x 3 and DMF x 3. Step 5 : Lactam Formation\n\n\nThe lactam ring was formed on the peptide resin using TBTU (2 eq.) and ethyldiisopropylamine (DIEA) (4 eq.) in 20 mL DMF for 1 hour. A second coupling may be needed if a positive Kaiser Ninhydrin test is observed. Step 6: Peptide Cleavage The peptide resin (0.6 mmol) was mixed with 20 mL of 5% sodium diethyldithio- carbamate trihydrate (NaCS\n2\nNEt\n2\n, Aldrich, #228680) in DMF for 20 min and then washed with DMF x 3, DCM x 3 and diethyl ether x 2.\n\n\nThe resin (0.6 mmol) was then stirred in a 25 mL of TFA/TIS/H2O (90 : 5.0 : 5.0 v/v/v) for 2.5 hours. The resin was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated to about 10 mL in volume and about 140 mL of cold diethyl ether (pre-cooled to about 0 \n0\nC) was added.\n\n\nThe mixture was vortexed, and then placed in the refrigerator (about -4 \n0\nC) for 1 h, centrifuged for 5 min at 2800 rpm, and the ether layer was decanted. \n\n The peptide was washed with 90 mL of cold diethyl ether (pre-cooled to about 0 \n0\nC), vortexed, centrifuged for 5 min at 2800 rpm, and ether layer decanted.\n\n\nThe resulting solid was dissolved in 50% AcOHZH\n2\nO and stored at room temperature overnight. The crude peptide solution was concentrated to afford solid crude peptide for HPLC purification.\n\n\nAfter HPLC purification, the peptide TFA salt was converted to peptide acetate salt using ion exchange (x 100 eq.). The anion exchange resin used was Dowex SBR LC NG, OH-form (Supelco, Cat# 14036-U). Example 46: Ac-Arg-cvc/o(Glu-Gln-D-Phe(4-CNVArg-Trp-Orn)-NH\nz\n (SEQ ID NO:51) The procedure described above was followed in the preparation of the title peptide. The amino acids added in step 2 were, in the order of being coupled, Fmoc- Trp(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-D-Phe(4-CN)-OH, Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH, Fmoc- GIu(OAIl)-OH, and Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH. The resulting peptide was purified by HPLC (column: Atlantis dC 18 OBD™ 19 x\n\n\n100 mm (5μ, Waters part # 186001367 ) using 10% MeOH/H\n2\nO containing 0.1% TFA (solvent A) and 90% MeOH/H\n2\nO containing 0.1% TFA (solvent B). A gradient of 0%-5% of solvent B for 5 min and 5%-35% of solvent B for 30 min was used.\n\n\nThe peptide yield was 10%. Example 67: Ac-Arg-cvc/o(Glu-Pro-D-Phe(4-F)-Arg-Trp-Orn)-NH\nz\n (SEQ ID NO:72)\n\n\nThe procedure described above was followed in the preparation of the title peptide except for that 15 mL of 5% sodium diethyldithio-carbamate trihydrate in DMF, 16 mL of TFA/TIS/H\n2\nO and 90 mL + 60 mL of diethyl ether were used in step 6. Moreover, the filtrate was concentrated to 5 mL. The amino acids added in step 2 were, in the order of being coupled, Fmoc-\n\n\nTrp(Boc)-OH, Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH, Fmoc-D-Phe(4-F)-OH, Fmoc-Pro-OH, Fmoc- GIu(OAIl)-OH, and Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH.\n\n\nThe resulting peptide was purified by HPLC (column: Atlantis dC18 OBD™ 19 x 100 mm (5μ, Waters part # 186001367 ) using 10% MeOH/H\n2\nO containing 0.1% TFA (solvent A) and 90% MeOH/H\n2\nO containing 0.1% TFA (solvent B).

In some instances, HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMCl-R were employed. Assays were performed in 96 well GF/B Millipore multiscreen filtration plates (MAFB NOBlO) pre-coated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V). Membrane homogenates were incubated with 0.2nM (for hMC4-R) 0.4 nM (for MC3-R and MC5-R) or 0.1 nM (for mouse B16 MCl-R or hMCl- R) [I\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH (Perkin Elmer) and increasing concentrations of test peptides of the present invention in buffer containing 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) with 100 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.3 mM 1,10-phenanthroline, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After incubation for 60 minutes at 37° C, the assay mixture was filtered and the \n\n membranes washed three times with ice-cold buffer. Filters were dried and counted in a gamma counter for bound radioactivity. Non-specific binding was measured by inhibition of binding of [I\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH in the presence of 1 μM NDP-α-MSH. Maximal specific binding (100%) was defined as the difference in radioactivity (cpm) bound to cell membranes in the absence and presence of 1 μM NDP-α-MSH. Radioactivity (cpm) obtained in the presence of test peptides was normalized with respect to 100% specific binding to determine the percent inhibition of [I\n125\n]-NDP-α-MSH binding. Each assay was conducted in triplicate and the actual mean values are described, with results less than 0% reported as 0%. Ki values for test peptides of the present invention were determined using Graph-Pad Prism® curve-fitting software. Results from this assay are presented herein (see 6.1). For some peptides, a mean value of more than two values is presented. 7.2 Assay for Agonist Activity.\n\n\nAccumulation of intracellular cAMP was examined as a measure of the ability of peptides of the present invention to elicit a functional response in HEK-293 cells that express MC4-R. Confluent HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hMC4-R were detached from culture plates by incubation in enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer. Dispersed cells were suspended in Earle's Balanced Salt Solution containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, ImM glutamine, 0.5% albumin and 0.3 mM 3-isobutyl-l- methyl-xanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 0.5 x 10\n5\n cells per well and pre-incubated for 10 minutes. Cells were exposed for 15 minutes at 37° C to peptides of the present invention dissolved in DMSO (final DMSO concentration of 1%) at a concentration range of 0.05 - 5000 nM in a total assay volume of 200 μL. NDP-α-MSH was used as the reference agonist. cAMP levels were determined by an HTRF® cAMP cell-based assay system from Cisbio Bioassays utilizing cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP, with plates read on a Perkin- Elmer Victor plate reader at 665 and 62OnM. Data analysis was performed by nonlinear regression analysis with Graph-Pad Prism\n®\n software. The maximum efficacies of test peptides of the present invention were compared to that achieved by the reference melanocortin agonist NDP-α-MSH, used as full agonist benchmark in this context. 7.3 High and Low Density hMC4-R Functional Assay.\n\n\nA HEK293 cell line transfected with human MC4-R (Palatin Technologies, US, with license from the University of Michigan) was used. The human MC4-R was \n\n introduced to HEK293 by using the T-REx™ System, Invitrogen. The T-REx™ System employs a tetracycline-regulated mammalian expression system that uses regulatory elements from the E. coli TniO-encoded tetracycline (T et) resistance operon. By use of the T-REx™ System, expression of the gene of interest, the human MC4-R gene, is repressed in the absence of tetracycline or doxycycline and induced in the presence of tetracycline or doxycycline (see T-REx™ System Manual, published by Invitrogen).\n\n\nHEK293-T-REX-MC4-R cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco 11965), supplemented with L-Glutamine (Gibco 25030), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 200 μg/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen 46-0072) and 6 μg/mL Blasticidin (Invitrogen 46-1120) in 5% CO\n2\n and 95% humidity at 37°C. T-150 flasks of cells at 75% confluence were incubated with two concentrations of doxycycline (0.1 ng/mL to provide a low density hMC4-R system and 10 ng/mL to provide a high density hMC4-R system) in 5% CO\n2\n at 37\n0\nC for 16-18 hours to induce MC4-R expression. On the day of the assay, the cells were washed with PBS (Gibco 14190) and harvested using cell dissociation buffer (Gibco 13150-016), then centrifuged and resuspended in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (+Ca, +Mg) (Gibco 14025), 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH 7.4) (Sigma H0887), ImM L-Glutamine (Gibco 25030), 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma A3311) and 0.3 mM 3-isobutyl-l-methyl-xanthine (IBMX). Cells were then counted and volume was adjusted to 2.5 x 10\n5\n cells per ml. The cells were then dispensed into 96-well plates (BD 353916) in 198 μL (about 5 x\n\n\n10\n4\n) cells/well and incubated for 10 minutes at 37\n0\nC. The compound to be tested was diluted with DMSO to a final concentration of 1 mM. Serial dilution was prepared in polypropylene removable 12-well library tube strips (VWR cat# 83009-682). 120 μL of the 1 mM compound stock was pipetted in the second column on the plate. Using the Janus liquid handler the compound was serially diluted 1 :10 (25 μL compound + 225 μL DMSO) to a total of 9 concentrations (representing final assay concentrations ranging from 10\n\"5\n to 10\n\"13\n M).\n\n\n2 μL of the standard, [NIe\n4\n, D-Phe\n7\n]-alpha-Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone (NDP- α-MSH), or compound was added to the 96-well plate using the Janus robotic system. All assay samples were run in duplicate (i.e. each sample was in two low dox and two high dox plates, respectively). The plates were gently shaken and incubated for 15 minutes at \n\n 37° C. The reaction was stopped by adding 15 μL of lysis buffer per well and the plates were shakened for 30 minutes at room temperature.\n\n\nAgonist stimulation of the MC4-R activates adenylate cyclase, which is an enzyme that catalyses the formation 3 ',5 '-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Thus, agonist stimulation of the MC4-R increases the levels of cAMP. cAMP-levels were measured with the cAMP dynamic 2 HTRF kit (CisBio cat# 62AM4PEC; see manual published by CisBio). cAMP levels were normalised against plate controls (1% DMSO for 0%, 400 nM NDP-α-MSH for 100%) and a calibration curve ranging from 712 nM to 0.04 nM cAMP (essentially as described in the CisBio HTRF kit). The plates were incubated on a shaker at room temperature for 1 hour and read on the Perkin-Elmer Victor plate reader at 665 and 620 nm. Fluoresence ratios were then calculated as described in the CisBio HTRF kit, with GraphPad Prism software used to plot the change in fluorescence percent values versus cAMP concentration using the variable slope dose response curve and, based on calculated cAMP concentrations, to determine EC50 values and percent activation. Results from this assay are presented herein (see 8.0). 7.4 Food Intake and Body Weight Change.\n\n\nChange in food intake and body weight was evaluated for selected peptides administered by subcutaneous injection route. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Hilltop Lab Animals, Inc. (Scottdale, PA). Animals were individually housed in conventional polystyrene hanging cages and maintained on a controlled 12 hour on/off light cycle. Water and pelleted food (ProLab RMH 2500, W.F. Fisher & Son Inc.) was provided ad libitum. The rats were dosed subcutaneously with vehicle (3.2% mannitol/50mM Tris buffer) or selected peptides (1.0 mg/kg). The changes in food intake for the 4 and 24 hour periods after dosing and the changes in body weight for the 24 hour period after dosing were determined. The changes in body weight and food intake for the 48 hour and 72 hour periods after dosing was also measured to determine reversal of changes in body weight and food intake effects back to baseline levels (not shown).\n\n\nFood intake (FI, 0-4 h and 0-24 h) and body weight (BW, 0-24 h) results from studies with 1.0 mg/kg subcutaneously of Examples 43, 46 and 67 and corresponding vehicle controls run in parallel are shown in Table 2 below, expressed as means ± SEM (n=8-10).\n\n\nTable 2 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5 Induction of Penile Erection.\n\n\nThe ability of peptides of the present invention to induce penile erection (PE) in male rats was evaluated with selected peptides. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250- 300 g were kept on a 12 hour on/off light cycle with food and water ad libitum. All behavioral studies were performed between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Groups of 6-8 rats were administered peptides at a variety of doses via the subcutaneous injection route. Immediately after treatment, rats were placed into individual polystyrene cages (27 cm long, 16 cm wide, and 25 cm high) for behavioral observation, typically by remote video monitoring (High-speed Digital Video Recording System EVS-DSX- 16000D VD-H with CCD cameras, Epic Systems Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) followed by blinded off-line scoring of video recordings. Rats were observed for one hour, and the number of yawns, grooming bouts and PEs were recorded in 10-minute bins.\n\n\nPE results from studies with 1.0-3.0 mg/kg subcutaneously of Examples 43, 46 and 67, along with Ref Ex 2, are shown in Table 3 below, expressed as total number of PE/rat, mean ± SEM (n=7-l 1) and number of rats/group showing at least one erection over the study period (% responders). Corresponding vehicle controls (3.2% mannitol/50mM Tris buffer) were run in parallel. \n\n Table 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.0 High and Low Density hMC4-R Functional Assay Results\n\n\nExemplified peptides were tested using the high and low density hMC4-R functional assay as described in Section 7.3 above, with the results as shown in Table 4 below. Table\n\n\n4 includes both single point values and mean values.\n\n\nTable 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is believed that peptides of the invention exhibiting an intrinsic activity of equal to or greater than about 0.1 (10%), such as greater than 0.2 (20%) or greater than about 0.3 (30%) or greater than about 0.4 (40%) or greater than about 0.5 (50%) or greater than about 0.6 (60%) %) or greater than about 0.7 (70%), or greater than about 0.8 (80%), or greater than about 0.9 (90%), or equal to or greater than about 1.0 (100%), in the above described high density hMC4-R system (i.e. HEK293TRexMC4R cells treated with 10 ng/ml doxycycline), based on maximal stimulation of adenylyl cyclase achievable by the compound in the same high density hMC4-R system where the maximal stimulation achieved by α-MSH or NDP-α-MSH is designated as an intrinsic activity of 1.0 (100%), provide agonist (full or partial) activity on the MC4 receptor. \n\n A majority of the peptides of the Examples which were tested in the above described high density hMC4-R system (i.e. HEK293TRexMC4R cells treated with 10 ng/ml doxycycline) gave in said assay EC50 values for cAMP production of less than 0.05 μM, such as less than 0.01 μM, and in particular less than 0.001 μM . As seen from Table 4, peptides of the invention may lack intrinsic activity in the low density hMC4-R system and be full agonists in the high density hMC4-R system.\n\n\nAs further seen from Table 4, peptides of the invention may be partial agonists in the above described low density hMC4-R system and full agonists in the above described high density hMC4-R system. As further seen from Table 4, peptides of the invention may be full agonists in both the low density hMC4-R system and in the high density hMC4-R system.\n\n\nWithout being bound by any theory, it is believed that peptides that either lack intrinsic activity or are partial agonists in the above described low density hMC4-R system (i.e. peptides having intrinsic activity of from 0 to 70% in the low density hMC4-R system) and are partial or full agonists in the above described high density hMC4-R system (i.e. peptides having intrinsic activity of equal to or above 10%, or above 70%, in the high density hMC4-R system) will provide no or a reduced level of sexual effects resulting from MC4 receptor activation, e.g. penile erection, compared to peptides being full agonists in both the low and the high density hMC4-R systems. As explained above, these sexual effects are considered unwanted side-effects upon treatment of energy homeostasis and metabolism related, food intake related and/or energy balance and body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions.\n\n\nIt is thus believed that peptides according to the invention possess promising MC4 receptor affinity, efficacy and potency to be useful for treatment of diseases, disorders and/or conditions responsive to activation of the MC4 receptor, in particular energy homeostasis and metabolism related (e.g. diabetes), food intake related and/or energy balance and body weight related diseases, disorders and/or conditions, including obesity, overweight and diseases, disorders and/or conditions associated with obesity and/or overweight, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Although the invention has been described in detail with particular reference to these preferred embodiments, other embodiments can achieve the same results. Variations \n\n and modifications of the present invention will be obvious to those skilled in the art and it is intended to cover all such modifications and equivalents."
