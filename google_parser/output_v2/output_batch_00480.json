There is evidence that histone acetylation and deacetylation are mechanisms by which transcriptional regulation in a cell—a major event in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis—is achieved. It has been hypothesized that these effects occur through changes in the structure of chromatin by altering the affinity of histone proteins for coiled DNA in the nucleosome. Hypoacetylation of histone proteins is believed to increase the interaction of the histone with the DNA phosphate backbone. Tighter binding between the histone protein and DNA can render the DNA inaccessible to transcriptional regulatory elements and machinery. HDACs have been shown to catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the epsilon-amino groups of lysine residues present within the N-terminal extension of core histones, thereby leading to hypoacetylation of the histones and blocking of the transcriptional machinery and regulatory elements.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInhibition of HDAC, therefore can lead to histone deacetylase-mediated transcriptional derepression of tumor suppressor genes. For example, cells treated in culture with HDAC inhibitors have shown a consistent induction of the kinase inhibitor p21, which plays an important role in cell cycle arrest. HDAC inhibitors are thought to increase the rate of transcription of p21 by propagating the hyperacetylated state of histones in the region of the p21 gene, thereby making the gene accessible to transcriptional machinery. Further, non-histone proteins involved in the regulation of cell death and cell-cycle also undergo lysine acetylation and deacetylation by HDACs and histone acetyl transferase (HATs).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis evidence supports the use of HDAC inhibitors in treating various types of cancers. For example, vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA)) has been approved by the FDA to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and is being investigated for the treatment of solid and hematological tumors. Further, other HDAC inhibitors are in development for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, myelodysplastic syndromes and solid tumor cancers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHDAC inhibitors also have been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as those involved in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders due to their ability to inhibit the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha. For example, the HDAC inhibitor MS275 was shown to slow disease progression and joint destruction in collagen-induced arthritis in rat and mouse models. Other HDAC inhibitors have been shown to have efficacy in treating or ameliorating inflammatory disorders or conditions in in vivo models or tests for disorders such as Crohn's disease, colitis, and airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness. HDAC inhibitors have also been shown to ameliorate spinal cord inflammation, demyelination, and neuronal and axonal loss in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHDACs are divided into four classes. Class I is represented by yeast RPD3-like proteins (HDAC-1, -2, -3, and -8). Class IIa (HDAC-4, -5, -7, and -9) and class IIb (HDAC-6 and -10) share domains with yeast HDAC-1. Class IV (e.g., HDAC-11) shares properties of both class I and II HDACs. HDACs are zinc dependent deacetylases. In general, HDAC inhibitors normally include a Zn-binding group, as well as a surface recognition domain. There remains a need to develop new HDAC inhibitors, which will be useful in the treatment of various neurological or inflammatory conditions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHence, there is a need to develop new HDAC inhibitors, which will be useful in the treatment of various neurological or inflammatory conditions.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention is based, inter alia, on the discovery of new compounds of Formula I that serve as inhibitors of Class I HDAC enzymes.

Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds described herein also include pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds disclosed herein. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to a salt formed by the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base to a compound disclosed herein. As used herein, the phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to a substance that is acceptable for use in pharmaceutical applications from a toxicological perspective and does not adversely interact with the active ingredient. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including mono- and bi-salts, include, but are not limited to, those derived from organic and inorganic acids such as, but not limited to, acetic, lactic, citric, cinnamic, tartaric, succinic, fumaric, maleic, malonic, mandelic, malic, oxalic, propionic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, nitric, sulfuric, glycolic, pyruvic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, salicylic, benzoic, and similarly known acceptable acids.

As used herein, “prodrug” refers to a moiety that releases a compound described herein when administered to a patient. Prodrugs can be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compounds in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compounds. Examples of prodrugs include compounds as described herein that contain one or more molecular moieties appended to a hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, or carboxyl group of the compound, and that when administered to a patient, cleave in vivo to form the free hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, or carboxyl group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups in the compounds described herein. Preparation and use of prodrugs is discussed in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, “Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,” Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following definitions are used, unless otherwise described. Specific and general values listed below for radicals, substituents, and ranges, are for illustration only; they do not exclude other defined values or other values within defined ranges for the radicals and substituents. Alkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl, and the like denote both straight and branched groups.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “alkyl,” employed alone or in combination with other terms, refers to a saturated hydrocarbon group that may be straight-chain or branched. In some embodiments, the alkyl group contains 1 to 12, 1 to 8, or 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Examples of alkyl moieties include, but are not limited to, chemical groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl; higher homologs such as 2-methyl-1-butyl, n-pentyl, 3-pentyl, n-hexyl, 1,2,2-trimethylpropyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like. In some embodiments, the alkyl moiety is methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, n-hexyl, or 2,4,4-trimethylpentyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “C\nn-m \nalkylene,” employed alone or in combination with other terms, refers to a divalent alkyl linking group having n to m carbon atoms.

Alkoxy can be, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, iso-butoxy, sec-butoxy, pentoxy, 2-pentoxy, 3-pentoxy, or hexyloxy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “aryl,” employed alone or in combination with other terms, refers to a monocyclic or polycyclic (e.g., having 2, 3 or 4 fused or covalently linked rings) aromatic hydrocarbon moiety, such as, but not limited to, phenyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, and the like. In some embodiments, aryl groups have from 6 to 20 carbon atoms, about 6 to 10 carbon atoms, or about 6 to 8 carbons atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs referred to herein, “heteroaryl” refers to a monocyclic, bicyclic, or tricyclic ring system containing one, two, or three aromatic rings and containing at least one (typically one to about three) nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atoms in an aromatic ring. Heteroaryl groups can possess optional substituents as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of heteroaryl groups include, but are not limited to, 2H-pyrrolyl, 3H-indolyl, 4H-quinolizinyl, acridinyl, benzo[b]thienyl, benzothiazolyl, β-carbolinyl, carbazolyl, chromenyl, cinnolinyl, dibenzo[b,d]furanyl, furyl, imidazolyl, indazolyl, indolyl, isobenzofuranyl, isoindolyl, isoquinolyl, isothiazolyl, isoxazolyl, naphthyridinyl, oxazolyl, phenanthridinyl, phenanthrolinyl, phenarsazinyl, phenazinyl, phenothiazinyl, phenoxathiinyl, phenoxazinyl, phthalazinyl, pteridinyl, purinyl, pyranyl, pyrazinyl, pyrazolyl, pyridazinyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrolyl, quinazolinyl, quinolyl, quinoxalinyl, thiadiazolyl, thianthrenyl, thiazolyl, thienyl, triazolyl, and xanthenyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithin the above definition, the term “heteroaryl” can include a monocyclic aromatic ring containing five or six ring atoms containing carbon and 1, 2, 3, or 4 heteroatoms independently selected from non-peroxide oxygen, sulfur, and N(Z) wherein Z is absent or is H, O, alkyl, phenyl or benzyl. The term heteroaryl can also include an ortho-fused bicyclic heterocycle of about eight to ten ring atoms derived therefrom, particularly a benz-derivative or one derived by fusing a propylene, trimethylene, or tetramethylene diradical thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs referred to herein, “optionally” substituted group refers to the substitution of a group in which one or more hydrogen atoms may be independently replaced with a non-hydrogen substituent. Groups that are optionally substituted are typically substituted with one to five substituents. In other embodiments, optionally substituted groups are substituted with one to three substituents. Typical substituents include, but are not limited to, —X, —R, —O\n−\n, ═O, —OR, —S\n−\n, —SR, —S(═O)R, —S(═O)\n2\nR, —S(═O)\n2\nO\n−\n, —S(═O)\n2\nOH, —OS(═O)\n2\nOR, —S(═O)\n2\nNR, —NR\n2\n, —N\n+\nR\n3\n, ═NR, —N═C═O, —NCS, —NO, —NO\n2\n, ═N\n2\n, —N\n3\n, —NC(═O)R, —CX\n3\n, —C(O)O\n−\n, —C(═O)R, —C(═O)OR, —C(═O)X, —C(═O)NRR, —C(S)R, —C(S)OR, —C(O)SR, —C(S)SR, —C(S)NRR, —C(NR)NRR, —CN, —OCN, —SCN, —OP(═O)(OR)\n2\n, —P(═O)(OR)\n2\n, —P(═O)(O\n−\n)\n2\n, —P(═O)(OH)\n2\n, where each X is independently a halogen (F, Cl, Br, or I); and each R is independently H, alkyl, aryl, a heterocycle, or a protecting group. When the substituent is attached to a group by two bonds (e.g., by a “double bond”), two hydrogen atoms are replaced by the substituent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the phrase “optionally substituted” means unsubstituted (e.g., substituted with a H) or substituted. As used herein, the term “substituted” means that a hydrogen atom is removed and replaced by a substitutent. It is understood that substitution at a given atom is limited by valency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, when a first ring is “optionally fused” to a second ring, the first ring may be unfused, or may be fused to the second ring. For example, a phenyl ring optionally fused to a phenyl ring refers to either an unfused phenyl ring or a naphthalene ring. As used herein, a ring “substituted at one ortho position” refers to a ring substituted at the position of the ring directly adjacent to the point of attachment of the ring to the core moiety (e.g. the core moiety of Formula (I)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt various places in the present specification, substituents of compounds described herein are disclosed in groups or in ranges. It is specifically intended that the invention include each and every individual subcombination of the members of such groups and ranges. For example, the term “C\n1-6 \nalkyl” is specifically intended to individually disclose methyl, ethyl, C\n3 \nalkyl, C\n4 \nalkyl, C\n5 \nalkyl, and C\n6 \nalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “C\nn-m \nalkylene,” employed alone or in combination with other terms, refers to a divalent alkyl group having n to m carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is further appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, can also be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment, can also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “n-membered” where n is an integer typically describes the number of ring-forming atoms in a moiety where the number of ring-forming atoms is n. For example, piperidinyl is an example of a 6-membered heterocycloalkyl ring and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalene is an example of a 10-membered cycloalkyl group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor compounds described herein in which a variable appears more than once, each variable can be a different moiety independently selected from the group defining the variable. For example, where a structure is described as having two R groups that are simultaneously present on the same compound, the two R groups can represent different moieties independently selected from the group defined for R. In another example, when an optionally multiple substituent is designated in the form:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nthen it is understood that substituent R can occur p number of times on the ring, and R can be a different moiety at each occurrence. It is understood that each R group may replace any hydrogen atom attached to a ring atom, including one or both of the (CH\n2\n)\nn \nhydrogen atoms. Further, in the above example, should the variable Q be defined to include hydrogens, such as when Q is said to be CH\n2\n, NH, etc., any floating substituent such as R in the above example, can replace a hydrogen of the Q variable as well as a hydrogen in any other non-variable component of the ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout the definitions, the term “C\nn-m\n” (e.g., C\n1-4\n, C\n1-6\n, and the like) is used, wherein n and m are integers and indicate the number of carbons, wherein n-m indicates a range which includes the endpoints.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless indicated otherwise, the nomenclature of substituents that are not explicitly defined herein are arrived at by naming the terminal portion of the functionality followed by the adjacent functionality toward the point of attachment. In generally, the point of attachment for a substituent is indicated by the last term in the group. For example, C\n1-6 \nheteroaryl-C\n1-4 \nalkyl refers to a moiety of heteroaryl-alkylene-, wherein the heteroaryl group has 1 to 6 carbon atoms, the alkylene linker has 1 to 4 carbons, and the substituent is attached through the alkylene linker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “C\nn-m \nalkynyl,” employed alone or in combination with other terms, refers to an alkyl group having one or more triple carbon-carbon bonds with n to m carbon atoms. Example alkynyl groups include, but are not limited to, ethynyl, propyn-1-yl, propyn-2-yl, and the like. In some embodiments, the alkynyl moiety contains 2 to 10 or 2 to 6 carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “C\nn-m \nalkynylene,” employed alone or in combination with other terms, refers to a divalent alkynyl group having n to m carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the alkynylene moiety contains 2 to 12 carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the alkynylene moiety contains 2 to 6 carbon atoms. Example alkynylene groups include, but are not limited to, ethyn-1,2-diyl, propyn-1,3-diyl, 1-butyn-1,4-diyl, 1-butyn-1,3-diyl, 2-butyn-1,4-diyl, and the like. As used herein, “C\nn-m \nalkenyl,” employed alone or in combination with other terms, refers to an alkyl group having one or more double carbon-carbon bonds, with n to m carbon atoms.

A given reaction can be carried out in one solvent or a mixture of more than one solvent. Depending on the particular reaction step, suitable solvents for a particular reaction step can be selected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared by procedures analogous to that described in General Scheme I. An amino acid or amino ester of formula (iii) (R is H or alkyl) may first be reacted with a compound of formula (i), wherein LG is a leaving group such as a halide (e.g., chloro) in the presence of a base such as a tertiary amine (e.g., dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), diisopropylethylamine (DMA or DIPEA), or triethylamine (TEA)) to form a compound of formula (iv). Alternatively, a carboxylic acid of formula (ii), wherein Y is C(═O), may be reacted with the amino acid or amino ester of formula (iii) in the presence of a coupling agent such as 1-ethyl-3-(3′-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDCI) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), or O-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-uronium-hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), in the presence of a base such as a tertiary amine (e.g., DMAP, DIPEA, or TEA) to produce the compound of formula (iv). Where R is alkyl, the ester of formula (iv) may be hydrolyzed in the next step to produce the carboxylic acid of formula (v). The carboxylic acid of the compound of formula (v) (or carboxylic acid of formula (iv) wherein R is H) may then be reacted with an aromatic amine compound of formula (vi) in the presence of a coupling agent(s) such as EDCI and HOBT, or HBTU, in the presence of a base such as a tertiary amine (e.g., DMAP, DIPEA, or TEA) to form a compound of formula (vii).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared by procedures analogous to that described in General Scheme II. The amino acid of formula (a) may first be protected using an appropriate protecting group such as 9H-fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) to give the protected amine of formula (b). The carboxylic acid of the protected amine can then be converted to an acid chloride of formula (c) by use of an appropriate reagent, such as thionyl chloride. The acid chloride of formula (c) may then be reacted with an aromatic amine of formula (d) in the presence of a base such as a tertiary amine (e.g., triethylamine) to form a compound of formula (e). The protecting group may then be removed by appropriate means (e.g., piperidine for Fmoc protected amines) to produce the amino compound of formula (f). Finally, the amine of formula (f) can be reacted with a carboxylic acid of formula (g) to form the desired compound of formula (h).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne of skill in the art will recognize that there are additional methods of producing the compounds of Formula I in addition to those described in General Schemes I and II and the surrounding text.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther compounds of Formula (I) can be synthesized by processes similar to that shown in General Scheme III. First, a cinnamate ester is formed by reaction of the nitro-benzaldehyde (i) with a Wittig reagent. It is recognized that nitrobenzaldehydes with different substitution patterns can be used to form different types of cinnamate esters. The nitro group of the ester (ii) can be reduced to the amine (iii), followed by reaction with an acid chloride (iv) (or sulfonic or sulfonic chloride, or sulfinate or sulfonate ester) to form the amide (v). The ester group of (v) can then be hydrolyzed to give the carboxylic acid (vi). The carboxylic acid (vi) can then be reacted to with an aromatic amine to give the desired compound of Formula I. Compounds with other linking groups can be formed starting from amine-ester compounds similar to compound (iii) of General Scheme III.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nUse\n\n\n \n \n \nA histone deacetylase (HDAC), as described herein, can be any polypeptide having features characteristic of polypeptides that catalyze the removal of the acetyl group (deacetylation) from acetylated target proteins. Features characteristic of HDACs are known in the art, see, for example, Finnin et al., 1999, Nature, 401:188. Thus, an HDAC can be a polypeptide that represses gene transcription by deacetylating the ε-amino groups of conserved lysine residues located at the N-termini of histones, e.g., H3, H4, H2A, and H2B, that form the nucleosome. HDACs also deacetylate other proteins such as p53, E2F, α-tubulin, and MyoD. See Annemieke et al., 2003, Biochem. J., 370:737. HDACs can also be localized to the nucleus and certain HDACs can be found in both the nucleus and also the cytoplasm.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHDAC inhibitors described herein may interact with any HDAC. However, the HDAC inhibitors will have at least about 2-fold (e.g., at least about 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, or 20-fold) greater activity to inhibit one or more class I HDACS (e.g., HDAC3) as compared to one or more other HDACs (e.g., one or more HDACs of class I or class II). Class I HDACs are those that most closely resemble the yeast transcriptional regulator RPD3. Examples of class I HDACs include \n \n \n \nHDACs\n \n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and 8, as well as any HDAC that has a deacetylase domain exhibiting from 45% to 93% identity in amino acid sequence to \n \n \n \nHDACs\n \n \n \n 1, 2, 3 and 8. Class II HDACs are those that most closely resemble the yeast HDAC1 enzyme. Examples of class II HDACs include \n \n \n \n \nHDACs\n \n \n \n \n 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a method of treating a cancer in patient in need thereof, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an HDAC inhibitor as described herein, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

or an inflammatory condition resulting from strain, sprain, cartilage damage, trauma such as burn, orthopedic surgery, infection or other disease processes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAllergic diseases and conditions, include but are not limited to respiratory allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, hypersensitivity lung diseases, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonias (e.g., Loeffler's syndrome, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia), delayed-type hypersensitivity, interstitial lung diseases (ILD) (e.g., idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or ILD associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, polymyositis or dermatomyositis); systemic anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity responses, drug allergies (e.g., to penicillin, cephalosporins), insect sting allergies, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, this application features methods of treating a neurological condition (e.g., Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA), myotonic dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, fragile X syndrome, Huntington's disease, a spinocerebellar ataxia, Kennedy's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and related diseases) that include administering an HDAC inhibitor described herein to a patient having a neurological condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, this application features the use of an HDAC inhibitor described herein in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of a neurological condition (e.g., Friedreich's ataxia, myotonic dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, fragile X syndrome, Huntington's disease, a spinocerebellar ataxia, Kennedy's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, or Alzheimer's disease); a cancer; or an inflammatory disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, this application features an HDAC inhibitor described herein for use in a method of treatment or prevention of a neurological condition (e.g., Friedreich's ataxia, myotonic dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, fragile X syndrome, Huntington's disease, a spinocerebellar ataxia, Kennedy's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, or Alzheimer's disease); a cancer; an inflammatory disorder; or a \nPlasmodium falciparum \ninfection (e.g., malaria).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn further aspect, the application provides a kit for the treatment or prevention of a disorder selected from a neurological disorder (e.g., Friedreich's ataxia, myotonic dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, fragile X syndrome, Huntington's disease, a spinocerebellar ataxia, Kennedy's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, or Alzheimer's disease), a cancer, an inflammatory disorder, or a \nPlasmodium falciparum \ninfection (e.g., malaria) in a patient in need thereof, comprising (i) a compound according to any one of \nclaims\n \n1\n to \n46\n, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and (ii) instructions comprising a direction to administer said compound to said patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention further relates to the discovery that specific histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) inhibitors also increase expression of frataxin, and could therefore be useful in the treatment of neurological conditions (e.g., neurological conditions associated with reduced frataxin expression). Accordingly, the invention provides HDAC3 inhibitors, methods of treating various chronic and/or acute neurological conditions such as, for example, Friedreich's ataxia, and methods of identifying compounds that could be used as therapeutics for various chronic and/or acute neurological conditions such as, for example, Friedreich's ataxia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe DNA abnormality found in 98% of FRDA patients is an unstable hyper-expansion of a GAA triplet repeat in the first intron of the frataxin gene that results in a defect in transcription of the frataxin gene (see Campuzano et al., 1996, Science, 271:1423-27). FRDA patients have a marked deficiency of frataxin mRNA, and the longer the GAA triplet repeats, the more profound the frataxin deficiency. FRDA is typical of triplet repeat diseases: normal alleles have 6-34 repeats while FRDA patient alleles have 66 1700 repeats. Longer GAA triplet repeats are associated with earlier onset and increased severity of the disease. The invention provides for methods of identifying specific HDAC3 inhibitors that can restore gene function in a neurological disease that is associated with expansion of a triplet repeat, such as FRDA or Huntington's disease. For example, HDAC3 inhibitors identified by the methods described herein increase frataxin mRNA and protein in lymphocytes from FRDA patients. A “histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) inhibitor” is a small molecule that binds to HDAC3 to modulate the levels of acetylation of histones, non-histone chromosomal proteins, and other cellular proteins. An HDAC3 inhibitor described herein may interact with a HDAC3 to modulate the level of acetylation of cellular targets.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect, the invention features methods of identifying a candidate compound for treatment of a neurological condition by obtaining a test compound; assaying a first activity of the test compound to inhibit histone deacetylase activity of a histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3); assaying a second activity of the test compound to inhibit histone deacetylase activity of a class I histone deacetylase other than the HDAC3 (e.g., HDAC1, HDAC2, or HDAC8); and identifying the test compound as a candidate compound for treatment of a neurological condition associated with a frataxin deficiency if the first activity of the test compound is greater than the second activity of the test compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, the invention features methods of identifying a candidate compound for treatment of a neurological condition by obtaining a test compound; assaying a first activity of the test compound to inhibit histone deacetylase activity of a HDAC3; assaying a second activity of the test compound to inhibit histone deacetylase activity of a HDAC1; assaying a third activity of the test compound to inhibit histone deacetylase activity of a HDAC2; assaying a fourth activity of the test compound to inhibit histone deacetylase activity of a HDAC8; and identifying the test compound as a candidate compound for treatment of a neurological condition if the first activity of the test compound is greater than each of the second, third, and fourth activities of the test compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further aspect, the invention features methods of identifying a candidate compound for treatment of a neurological condition by obtaining a test compound; assaying a first activity of the test compound to inhibit histone deacetylase activity of a HDAC3; assaying a second activity of the test compound to inhibit histone deacetylase activity of a class I or class II histone deacetylase other than the HDAC3 (e.g., HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC8, HDAC9, or HDAC10); and identifying the test compound as a candidate compound for treatment of a neurological condition associated with a frataxin deficiency if the first activity of the test compound is greater than the second activity of the test compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, this application features methods of identifying a candidate compound for treatment of a neurological condition by obtaining a test compound; assaying a first activity of the test compound to inhibit histone deacetylase activity of a HDAC3; assaying a set of activities of the test compound to inhibit histone deacetylase activity of each of \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhistone deacetylases\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10; and identifying the test compound as a candidate compound for treatment of a neurological condition if the first activity of the test compound is greater than each activity of the set of activities of the test compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the above methods, one or more of the HDACs (e.g., HDAC3) is a human HDAC (e.g., a human HDAC3).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the above methods, the test compound is identified as a candidate compound for treatment of a neurological condition if the first activity is at least about 1.5-fold greater (e.g., at least about 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, or 20-fold greater) than another activity (e.g., the second, third, or fourth activity, or each activity of the set of activities).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the above methods, the neurological condition is Friedreich's ataxia, myotonic dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, fragile X syndrome, Huntington's disease, a spinocerebellar ataxia, Kennedy's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, or Alzheimer's disease. In some embodiments of the above methods, the neurological condition is associated with expansion of a triplet repeat (e.g., Friedreich's ataxia, myotonic dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, fragile X syndrome, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, or Kennedy's disease).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the above methods, the methods further include assaying the activity of the candidate compound to increase expression of one or more genes whose expression is decreased in the neurological condition (e.g., frataxin, huntingtin, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, \ncoactivator\n 1, alpha (PGC1A), ataxin, fragile X mental retardation (FMR1), dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK), or androgen receptor). In some embodiments, the activity of the candidate compound to increase expression of one or more genes whose expression is decreased in the neurological condition is measured in an animal, e.g., an animal model of the neurological condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments of the above methods, the method is repeated for a plurality of test compounds (e.g., at least 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, or 1000 test compounds).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect, this application features methods of treating a neurological condition (e.g., Friedreich's ataxia, myotonic dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, fragile X syndrome, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, Kennedy's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, or Alzheimer's disease) that include performing any of the above methods, formulating the candidate compound in a pharmaceutical composition, and administering the pharmaceutical composition to a patient having a neurological condition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSpecific inhibitors of HDAC3 provide advantages for treatment of neurological conditions over the use of broad-spectrum HDAC inhibitors by reducing toxicities associated with inhibition of other HDACs. Such specific HDAC3 inhibitors provide a higher therapeutic index, resulting in better tolerance by patients during chronic or long-term treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHDAC inhibitors have been shown to have antimalarial activity (Andrews et al., 2000, Int. J. Parasitol., 30:761-768; Andrews et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 52:1454-61). The present invention provides methods of treating a \nPlasmodium falciparum \ninfection (e.g., malaria) in a patient in need thereof.\n\n\n \nAssaying Test Compounds\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain aspects, inhibitors of specific HDACs are found by identifying test compounds (e.g., from a group of test compounds) that inhibit the activity of a specific HDAC (e.g., HDAC3) more, e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, or more times, than they inhibit the activity of one or more other HDACs. HDAC inhibitory activity of test compounds can be assayed by standard means. Briefly, an assay typically involves incubating an acetylated HDAC substrate with a HDAC enzyme in the presence or absence of a test compound and detecting the removal of acetyl groups from the substrate. HDAC inhibition assays can be performed, e.g., in a cell, in a cell extract, or in a cell-free mixture. Exemplary HDAC inhibition assays are described in Pérez-Balado et al., 2007, J. Med. Chem., 50:2497-2505; Herman et al., 2006, Nat. Chem. Biol., 2:551-558; and Beckers et al., 2007, Int. J. Cancer, 121:1138-48. HDAC assay kits are commercially available from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, Pa.) and Upstate (Charlottesville, Va.). A small molecule microarray method for screening for HDAC inhibitors is described in Vegas et al., 2007, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 46:7960-64.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHDAC enzymes can be provided, e.g., as purified proteins, partially purified proteins, purified recombinant proteins, in cells, or cell extracts. Purification or partial purification of HDAC3 and other HDAC enzymes can be performed by standard means, including affinity chromatography and immunoprecipitation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HDAC substrate can be a commercially available substrate (e.g., Fluor de Lys™, BIOMOL) or an acetylated cellular HDAC substrate, e.g., histone H2A, histone H2B, histone H3, histone H4, α-tubulin, NFκB-3, or p53. Exemplary substrates further include acetylated peptides of the preceding proteins, e.g., residues 2-24 or 1-18 of Histone H4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe deacetylation of the HDAC substrate can be detected by standard means. Commercially available substrates are provided with fluorimetric or colorimetric reagents that detect deacetylated lysines. In other aspects, the substrate can be \n3\nH-acetylated, and deacetylation is detected by measuring the release of \n3\nH from the substrate. In further aspects, antibodies can be used to distinguish acetylated substrates from deacetylated substrates. For example, antibodies specific for acetylated α-tubulin are available from Sigma, and antibodies specific for acetylated histone H3 are available from Upstate. Compounds identified as HDAC3 inhibitors can be further tested for induction of expression of one or more genes that are underexpressed in a neurological disorder, e.g., frataxin (GenBank Accession No. NM\n—\n000144.3), huntingtin (GenBank Accession No. NM\n—\n002111.6), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; GenBank Accession No. NM\n—\n170735.4), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, \ncoactivator\n 1, alpha (PGC1A; GenBank Accession No. NM\n—\n013261.3), ataxins (e.g., ataxin 1 (GenBank Accession No. NM\n—\n000332.2), fragile X mental retardation (FMR1; GenBank Accession No. NM\n—\n002024.3), dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK; GenBank Accession No. NM\n—\n004409.3), or androgen receptor (GenBank Accession No. NM\n—\n000044.2). Listed GenBank accession numbers indicate exemplary human cDNA sequences and are not meant to be limiting. Sequences of other alleles or alternatively spliced versions can also be used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, the inhibitor is administered to a cell or cell-free extract that expresses a nucleic acid or protein product of the gene, and the expression of the gene product is compared to its expression in the absence of the inhibitor. Any cells can be used, including primary cells obtained from a subject (e.g., a subject having a neurological disorder) or cells of a cell line. Exemplary cells include neural cells, neuronal cells, and lymphocytes. The cells can be isolated and stored frozen in aliquots to provide ease in scaling the assay to allow multiple samples or multiple assays to be done with the same cell source. In one embodiment, the cells are lymphocytes (e.g., derived from Friedreich's ataxia patients), which are primary cells or cells of a lymphoblastoid cell line.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetermination of the expression of nucleic acid and protein gene products can be accomplished by any of several standard methods. Nucleic acid expression can be determined, e.g., by hybridization (e.g., Northern blotting), nucleic acid microarrays, PCR (e.g., reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) or quantitative RT-PCR), primer extension, serial analysis of gene expression, nuclease protection assays, or reporter gene constructs. Protein expression can be determined, e.g., by immunoblotting (e.g., Western blotting), immunoprecipitation, immunosorbent assay (e.g., ELISA or RIA), peptide microarrays, or fusion proteins (e.g., GFP fusions).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUseful compounds for chronic treatment include those that inhibit HDAC3 at concentrations that do not show significant cytotoxic activity. Cytotoxic activity can be measured by incubating compounds with an indicator cell line (e.g., the human transformed liver cell HepG2). Viable cell number is determined after an incubation period, typically between 24-72 hours following administration of the compound. Viable cells can be determined by many methods including but not limited to cell counting or using a substrate converted to a colored product by live cells such as MTS. The ratio of HDAC3 activity to cytotoxicity can identify molecules that increase expression of gene products reduced by disease and are tolerable to administration over long periods of time.\n\n\n \nMethods of Administering HDAC Inhibitors\n\n\n \n \n \nHDAC inhibitors, e.g., those inhibitors described herein, can be used prophylactically or as a treatment for various conditions described herein, including neurological conditions (e.g., neurological conditions associated with frataxin deficiency). More specifically, HDAC inhibitors (e.g., those identified by the methods described herein) can be used to delay or prevent the onset of one or more symptoms of a neurodegenerative or neuromuscular condition, as well as to treat a mammal, such as a human subject, suffering from a neurological condition (e.g., a neurodegenerative or neuromuscular condition). Non-limiting examples of neurodegenerative conditions include, without limitation, fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Kennedy's disease, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and Alzheimer's disease. Non-limiting examples of neuromuscular conditions include spinal muscular atrophy and myotonic dystrophy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMammals, e.g. humans, to which HDAC inhibitors can be administered include those suffering from, or diagnosed as having, the conditions discussed herein as well as those who are at risk for developing the above conditions. A mammal at risk for developing a neurodegenerative condition can be identified in numerous ways, including, for example, first determining (1) the length, extent, and/or number of repeats of particular nucleic acid sequences (e.g., a frataxin gene sequence, a huntingtin gene sequence, an ataxin gene sequence, a fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene sequence, a dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene sequence, or an androgen receptor gene sequence) in the individual's genome; the degree of acetylation of core histones; or the expression level of a particular mRNA or protein (e.g., frataxin, huntingtin, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, \ncoactivator\n 1, alpha (PGC1A), ataxin, fragile X mental retardation (FMR1), dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK), or androgen receptor), and then (2) comparing it with that of a normal individual (see Riley et al., 2006, Genes Dev., 20:2183-92; Tan et al., 2005, Expert Rev. Mol. Diagn., 5:101-109; Everett et al., 2004, Brain, 127:2385-2405; Monckton et al., 1995, Circulation, 91:513-520; and Caskey et al., 1992, Science, 256:784-789). An individual at risk for developing a neurodegenerative or neuromuscular condition is one who has an aberrant number of repeats of a particular nucleic aid sequence, degree of acetylation of core histones or expression of a particular gene. For example, an animal or person at risk for developing Friedreich's ataxia can be identified by determining the length, extent, or number of repeats of a GAA triplet in the first intron of the frataxin gene. A person would be at risk for Friedreich's ataxia if the above analysis indicates that there are more than 34 repeats of the GAA triplet, for example, if the person has more than 66 repeats of the GAA triplet. A person at risk for Friedreich's ataxia could also be identified by determining the levels of frataxin mRNA or protein expressed in the person. A person would be at risk for Friedreich's ataxia if the levels of frataxin mRNA or protein is lower than the level normally observed in a healthy individual such as for example, an unaffected sibling.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor test purposes, a HDAC inhibitor can be administered to an animal or cellular model of a neurological condition. In some embodiments, an HDAC inhibitor is administered to an animal model with a naturally occurring or genetically engineered triplet repeat expansion. Exemplary animal models are described in Al-Mandawi et al., 2006, Genomics, 88:580-590; R\na1 \net al., 2008, PLoS ONE 3:e1958 doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0001958; Wang et al., 2006, Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 27:1287-1302; Butler et al., 2006, Nat. Rev. Neurosci., 7:784-796; Bates and Gonitel, 2006, Mol. Biotechnol., 32:147-158; Puccio, 2007, Handb. Exp.

Neurosci., 18:115-136; Cauchi and van den Heuvel, 2006, Neurodegener. Dis., 3:338-356; Grieb, 2004, Folia Neuropathol., 42:239-248; Robertson et al., 2002, Biochimie, 84:1151-60; Newman et al., 2007, Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1772:285-297; Van Dam and De Deyn, 2006, Nat. Rev. Drug Discov., 5:956-970; and Shaughnessy et al., J. Mol. Neurosci., 24:23-32.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor therapy or prophylaxis, the amount of HDAC inhibitor to be administered to the individual can be any amount appropriate to restore the level of histone acetylation, or the level of mRNA or protein expression, in the afflicted individual to that typical of a healthy individual such as an unaffected sibling. The amount of the HDAC inhibitor to be administered can be an effective dose or an appropriate fraction thereof, if administration is performed serially. Such amounts will depend on individual patient parameters including age, physical condition, size, weight, the condition being treated, the severity of the condition, and any concurrent treatment. For example, the effective dose range that is necessary to prevent or delay the onset of the neurodegenerative condition, can be lower than the effective dose range for inhibiting the progression of the condition being treated. Factors that determine appropriate dosages are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be addressed with routine experimentation. For example, determination of the physicochemical, toxicological and pharmacokinetic properties can be made using standard chemical and biological assays and through the use of mathematical modeling techniques known in the chemical, pharmacological and toxicological arts. The therapeutic utility and dosing regimen can be extrapolated from the results of such techniques and through the use of appropriate pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic models. The precise amount of HDAC inhibitor administered to a patient will be the responsibility of the attendant physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn particular, HDAC inhibitors can be administered orally or by injection at a dose of from 0.1 to 30 mg per kg weight of the mammal, typically 2 to 15 mg/kg weight of the mammal. The dose range for adult humans is generally from 8 to 2,400 mg/day, e.g., from 35 to 1,050 mg/day. If the salt of the compound is administered, then the amount of salt administered is calculated in terms of the base.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHDAC inhibitors can be administered in numerous ways. For example, the HDAC inhibitors can be administered orally, rectally, topically, or by intramuscular, intraperitoneal subcutaneous or intravenous injection. Preferably, the inhibitors are administered orally or by injection. Other routes include intrathecal administration directly into spinal fluid and direct introduction onto, in the vicinity of, or within the target cells. The route of administration will depend on the condition being treated and its severity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nToxicity and therapeutic efficacy of HDAC inhibitors can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred. In another embodiment, the therapeutic index can be estimated by assaying the HDAC3 specific inhibitory activity of a HDAC3 inhibitor (the HDAC3 IC\n50\n) as compared to the growth inhibitory activity of the HDAC3 inhibitor on a cell in vitro, e.g., a HepG2 cell or other cell line (the growth IC\n50\n). The ratio between the growth inhibitory (e.g., cytotoxic or cytostatic) effect and the HDAC3 specific inhibitory effect provides an estimate of the therapeutic index.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nHDAC inhibitors can be administered neat or formulated as pharmaceutical compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions include an appropriate amount of the HDAC inhibitor in combination with an appropriate carrier and optionally as other useful ingredients.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcceptable salts of HDAC inhibitors include, but are not limited to, those prepared from the following acids: alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkylaryl and alkenylaryl mono-, di- and tricarboxylic acids of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, optionally substituted by 1 to 4 hydroxyls; alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkylaryl and alkenylaryl mono-, di- and trisulfonic acids of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, optionally substituted by 1 to 4 hydroxyls; dibasic acids and mineral acids. Examples include hydrochloric; hydrobromic; sulfuric; nitric; phosphoric; lactic (including (+)-L-lactic, (+/−)-DL-lactic); fumaric; glutaric; maleic; acetic; salicyclic; p-toluenesulfonic; tartaric (including (+)-L-tartaric); citric; methanesulfonic; formic; malonic; succinic; naphthalene-2-sulfonic; and benzenesulfonic acid. Also, pharmaceutically-acceptable salts can be prepared as amine salts, ammonium salts, or alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts, such as sodium, potassium or calcium salts of the carboxylic acid group. These are formed from alkaline metal or alkaline earth metal bases or from amine compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of HDAC inhibitors suitable for oral administration can be in the form of (1) discrete units such as capsules, sachets, tablets, or lozenges each containing a predetermined amount of the HDAC inhibitor; (2) a powder or granules; (3) a bolus, electuary, or paste; (4) a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or (5) an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Compositions suitable for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally or sublingually, include lozenges. Compositions suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions or injection solutions. Compositions suitable for rectal administration can be presented as a suppository.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of HDAC inhibitors can be formulated using a solid or liquid carrier. The solid or liquid carrier should be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient. If the pharmaceutical composition is in tablet form, then the HDAC inhibitor is mixed with a carrier having the necessary compression properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. If the composition is in powder form, the carrier is a finely divided solid in admixture with the finely divided active ingredient. The powders and tablets can contain up to 99% of the active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include, for example, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugars, lactose, dextrin, starch, gelatin, cellulose, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine, low melting waxes and ion exchange resins. A solid carrier can include one or more substances that can act as flavoring agents, lubricants, solubilizers, suspending agents, fillers, glidants, compression aids, binders or tablet-disintegrating agents. A suitable carrier can also be an encapsulating material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the composition is a solution, suspension, emulsion, syrup, elixir, or pressurized composition, then liquid carriers can be used. In this case, the HDAC inhibitor is dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carrier. Suitable examples of liquid carriers for oral and parenteral administration include (1) water; (2) alcohols, e.g. monohydric alcohols and polyhydric alcohols such as glycols, and their derivatives; and (3) oils, e.g. fractionated coconut oil and arachis oil. For parenteral administration, the carrier can also be an oily ester such as ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate. Liquid carriers for pressurized compositions include halogenated hydrocarbon or other pharmaceutically acceptable propellant. The liquid carrier can contain other suitable pharmaceutical additives such as solubilizers; emulsifiers; buffers; preservatives; sweeteners; flavoring agents; suspending agents; thickening agents; colors; viscosity regulators; stabilizers; osmo-regulators; cellulose derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose; antioxidants; and bacteriostatics. Other carriers include those used for formulating lozenges such as sucrose, acacia, tragacanth, gelatin and glycerin as well as those used in formulating suppositories such as cocoa butter or polyethylene glycol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the composition is to be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection, solutions of the HDAC inhibitor can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The composition suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient, which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form should be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium as described above. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the HDAC inhibitor in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze-drying techniques, which yield a powder of the HDAC inhibitor, plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions can be in unit-dose or multi-dose form or in a form that allows for slow or controlled release of the HDAC inhibitor. Each unit-dose can be in the form of a tablet, capsule or packaged composition such as, for example, a packeted powder, vial, ampoule, prefilled syringe or sachet containing liquids. The unit-dose form also can be the appropriate number of any such compositions in package form. Pharmaceutical compositions in multi-dose form can be in packaged in containers such as sealed ampoules and vials. In this case, the HDAC inhibitor can be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of a sterile liquid carrier immediately prior to use. In addition, extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\nRGFA8 Increases Expression of Frataxin\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine whether RGFA8 (N′-(2-aminophenyl)-N\n7\n-p-tolylheptanedioic acid diamide; WO 2007/058927) or other compounds could increase expression of frataxin, human lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood from normal donors were incubated with 1-30 μM RGFA8. Frataxin mRNA levels were measured with quantitative RT-PCR and normalized to expression levels of the housekeeping gene GADPH (Herman et al., Nat. Chem. Biol., 2:551-558, 2006).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRGFA8 increased expression of frataxin in normal lymphocytes or patient lymphocytes at all concentrations tested, with a maximum observed increase of about 16-fold compared to vehicle control (\nFIG. 1\n, normal lymphocytes). This example indicates that RGFA8 could be used to treat patients with Friedreich's ataxia by increasing frataxin expression.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nRGFA8 is a Specific Inhibitor of HDAC3\n\n\n \n \n \nTo determine whether RGFA8 was specific for any particular HDAC or subset of HDACs, the activities of RGFA8 and known HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) were tested on a panel of individual purified HDAC enzymes and a nuclear extract, which contained a mixture of HDACs. HDAC enzyme inhibition assays were performed using purified HDACs 1-10 essentially as described in Beckers et al., 2007, Int. J. Cancer., 121:1138-48 and Pérez-Balado et al., 2007, J. Med. Chem., 50:2497-2505 Inhibition assays using nuclear extract were performed essentially as described in Herman et al., 2006, Nat. Chem. Biol., 2:551-558. Briefly, the purified HDACs or nuclear extract were incubated with an acetylated substrate in the absence of the compound to be assayed and with increasing concentrations of the compound. The rate of substrate deacetylation was measured under each condition, and half-maximal inhibitory concentration with regard to each HDAC was determined by standard means.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRGFA8 was most active on HDAC3, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC\n50\n) of 0.7 μM (Table 1). At least 10-fold lesser activity was observed by RGFA8 on other HDACs or on nuclear extract. Although TSA was found to be a more potent inhibitor of HDAC3 than RGF8, TSA had greater inhibitory activity on HDAC6 (IC\n50 \nof 0.0014±0.0006) and HDAC1 (IC\n50 \nof 0.0067 μM) as compared to HDAC3 (IC\n50 \nof 0.0096 μM). Sub-micromolar inhibition by TSA was observed for all HDACs tested.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInhibition of HDAC Activity by RGFA8 and TSA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC\n50 \n(μM)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEnzyme or Extract\n\n\nRGFA8\n\n\nTSA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHDAC1\n\n\n3.05\n\n\n0.0067\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHDAC2\n\n\n3.73\n\n\n0.0148\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHDAC3\n\n\n0.74\n\n\n0.0096\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHDAC4\n\n\n>100\n\n\n0.0348\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHDAC5\n\n\n>100\n\n\n0.0125\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHDAC6\n\n\n>80\n\n\n0.0014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHDAC7\n\n\n>100\n\n\n0.197\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHDAC8\n\n\n>100\n\n\n0.165\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHDAC9\n\n\n>100\n\n\n0.0701\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHDAC10\n\n\n>66.2\n\n\n0.0228\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNuclear Extract\n\n\n6.00\n\n\n0.0012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis example demonstrates that RGFA8 specifically inhibits HDAC3 as compared to other human HDACs.

Briefly, a chemical library of test compounds was created by standard organic chemistry methods, and the inhibitory activity of the compounds on purified HDACs 1-10 was determined (see Example 2). Fourteen compounds were identified that had stronger inhibitory activity for HDAC3 as compared to one or more other HDACs. These compounds, their structures, and inhibitory activities for HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC5, are presented in Table 2, along with growth inhibitory activity on HepG2 cells. HDAC inhibitory activities were measured essentially as described in Example 2. Growth inhibition of HepG2 cells was measured by adding serial dilutions of the compounds to HepG2 cells at a density of 5×10\n4 \ncells/ml, and incubating the mixture for 72 hours at 37° C., 5% CO\n2\n. The viable cells were then measured using a CellTiter 96™ AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.).

The mice are treated by subcutaneous daily injections with 150 mg/kg of compound or its equivalent of vehicle, for 3 consecutive days. Brain, heart, and skeletal muscle are recovered 24 hours after the last injection. Total RNA from brain stem, heart, and/or cerebellum is extracted. Frataxin mRNA expression is determined by one step quantitative real-time PCR using the \nprimers\n 5′-CCTGGCCGAGTTCTTTGAAG-3′ (SEQ ID NO:1) and 5′-GCCAGATTTGCTTGTTTGG-3′ (SEQ ID NO:2). Frataxin mRNA is significantly lower in the brain, cerebellum and heart of vehicle-treated knock-in mice than in similarly treated wild-type animals. Treatment with compound R01 increases knock-in frataxin mRNA to levels that do not significantly differ from wild-type, thus demonstrating correction of fxn deficiency in these animals. Western blotting confirms that increased fxn mRNA levels result in higher frataxin protein level. Treatment with compound R01 does not result in increased frataxin mRNA levels in wild-type animals, indicating that its effect is due to removal of the inhibition caused by the GAA expansion.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nSynthesis of R01\n\n\nN-[6-(2-aminophenylamino)-6-oxohexyl]-4-methylbenzamide\n\n\n \n \n \nThis compound was made the procedure shown below.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n6-(4-Methylbenzamido)hexanoic acid\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n4-Methylbenzoyl chloride (1.46 g, 9.5 mmol) was added dropwise to a mixture of 6-aminohexanoic acid (1.31 g, 10 mmol) and DMAP (1.22 g, 10 mmol) in THF (100 mL) at 0° C.

A single dose of compound R03 at 50 mg/kg was administered subcutaneously to eight mice per group of knock-in mice homozygous for a (GAA)\n230 \nrepeat in the first intron of the endogenous frataxin gene (Miranda et al., 2002, FEBS Lett., 512:291-297). Brain, heart, and skeletal muscle were recovered 24 hours after the injection. Total RNA from brain stem, heart, and/or cerebellum were extracted. Frataxin mRNA expression was determined by one-step quantitative real-time PCR using the \nprimers\n 5′ CCTGGCCGAGTTCTTTGAAG-3′ (SEQ ID NO:1) and 5′-GCCAGATTTGCTTGTTTGG-3′ (SEQ ID NO:2).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrataxin mRNA was significantly lower in the brain, cerebellum, and heart of vehicle-treated knock-in mice than in similarly treated wild-type animals. Treatment with compound R03 increased knock-in frataxin mRNA to levels that do not significantly differ from wild-type, thus demonstrating essentially complete correction of Fxn deficiency in these animals. Western blotting confirmed that increased Fxn mRNA levels resulted in higher frataxin protein level.\n\n\n \nExample 43\n\n\nCompound R03 Alleviates Symptoms in an FRDA Mouse Model\n\n\n \n \n \nThis example demonstrates that compound R03 alleviates symptoms in a mouse model of FRDA. Compound R03 was administered to mice expressing from a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) a human FXN gene with a GAA repeat expansion (190+90 repeats) and lacking the mouse Fxn gene (FXN\n+\n, fxn\n−/−\n). Production of these mice, known as “YG8 rescue,” because the expression of the expanded human FXN gene from the YAC rescues the embryonic lethality of the homozygous Fxn knockout, is described in Al-Mandawi et al., 2006, Genomics, 88:580-590, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. These YG8 rescue mice present a mild phenotype consistent with less severe, later onset cases of FRDA in humans. The mice have reduced frataxin expression, reduced coordination and locomotor activity, increased weight, impaired aconitase activity, and oxidative stress as compared to wild-type littermate controls. Thus, this model provides a reasonable correlation to the human disorder for the purposes of testing potential new drugs to treat FRDA in humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe YG8 rescue mice were treated daily with compound R03 beginning at three months of age, with treatment continuing over a period of five months. The mice were administered subcutaneously 50 mg/kg of compound R03 in vehicle (20% propylene glycol, 20% polyethylene glycol-400, 20% glycerol, 100 mM acetate pH 5.4) or vehicle alone (n=20 per treatment group). Coordination, activity, and weight were assayed at the initiation of treatment and each month thereafter. The average weight of the drug-treated mice were consistently lower than the control mice, although this difference was not significant at any time point (\nFIG. 2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCoordination was assayed using the rotarod analysis essentially as described in Al-Mandawi et al. Briefly, treated and control mice were placed on a Ugo-Basille 7650 accelerating rotarod treadmill apparatus. The apparatus was set at a constant rotation speed, and the latency time taken for each mouse to fall from the rod was recorded. The mice performed four trials each, with a 10-minute rest between each trial. The latency to fall increased for the drug-treated mice, whereas the latency to fall for the control mice increased initially and then decreased thereafter (\nFIG. 3\n). This experiment indicates that compound R03 was effective to increase coordination of the FRDA model mice.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivity was assayed by placing the mice in a gridded open-field Persipex box and recording the number of gridded squares entered by each mouse over a 30 second period. Four trials were performed for each mouse at each time point. The number of squares entered per mouse increased over the course of the trial for the drug-treated mice, whereas the activity of the control mice increased initially and then decreased thereafter (\nFIG. 4\n). This experiment indicates that compound R03 was effective to increase activity of the FRDA model mice.\n\n\n \nOther Embodiments\n\n\n \n \n \nA number of embodiments of the invention have been described. Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, other embodiments are within the scope of the following claims."

The Government may have certain rights in the invention.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates generally to biologically active hetero pyrrole analogs such as imidazoles, thiazoles, oxazoles and pyrazoles capable of interacting with the CB1 and/or the CB2 cannabinoid receptors. One aspect of the invention is concerned with new and improved hetero pyrrole analogs acting as antagonists for the CB1 and/or the CB2 receptors. Another aspect of the invention is concerned with new and improved hetero pyrrole analogs having selectivity for the CB1 or CB2 cannabinoid receptor. Still other aspects of the invention are concerned with pharmaceutical preparations employing the inventive analogs and methods of administering therapeutically effective amounts of the inventive analogs to provide a physiological effect.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nMarijuana (\nCannabis sativa\n) and derivatives have been used for medicinal and recreational purposes. The major active constituent extracted from \nCannabis sativa \nis the classical cannabinoid Δ\n9\n-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ\n9\n-THC). The effects of such cannabinoids are due to an interaction with specific high-affinity receptors. Presently, two cannabinoid receptors have been characterized: CB1, a central receptor found in the mammalian brain and a number of other sites in peripheral tissues; and CB2, a peripheral receptor found principally in cells related to the immune system. The CBI receptor is believed to mediate the psychoactive properties associated with classical cannabinoids. Characterization of these receptors has been made possible by the development of specific synthetic ligands such as the agonists WIN 55212-2 and CP 55,940.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition to acting at the cannabinoid receptors, cannabinoids such as Δ\n9\n-THC also affect cellular membranes, thereby producing undesirable side effects such as drowsiness, impairment of monoamine oxidase function and impairment of non-receptor mediated brain function. The addictive and psychotropic properties of some cannabinoids also limit their therapeutic value.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternational Publication number WO 03/007887 A2 to Finke et al describes imidazole derivatives alleged to have binding affinity for the central cannabinoid receptor. International Publication number WO 03/027076 A2 to Kruse et al also describes some imidazole derivatives alleged to have binding affinity for cannabinoid receptors.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nBriefly stated, one embodiment of the invention is concerned with new and improved cannabimimetic (cannabinoid like) imidazole analogs.

The inventive compounds described herein, and physiologically acceptable salts thereof, have pharmacological properties when administered in therapeutically effective amounts for providing a physiological response useful to treat marijuana abuse, obesity, schizophrenia, epilepsy, stress, memory disorders, migraine, vomiting, thymic disorders, dyskinesia, kinetic disorder, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, cognitive disorders, appetite disorders, mood disorders, delirious disorders, neuropathies, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimers disease, depression, psychosomatic-induced disease, as well as for alcohol, opioid, nicotine and cocaine addiction, etc. Additionally, these analogs can be useful in cancer chemotherapy. Typically, a “therapeutically effective amount” of an inventive compound is believed to range from about 10 mg/day to about 1,000 mg/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, an “individual” refers to a human. An “animal” refers to, for example, veterinary animals, such as dogs, cats, horses and the like, and farm animals, such as cows, pigs and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of the present invention can be administered by a variety of known methods, including orally, rectally, or by parenteral routes (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, nasal or topical). The form in which the compounds are administered will be determined by the route of administration. Such forms include, but are not limited to, capsular and tablet formulations (for oral and rectal administration), liquid formulations (for oral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, ocular, intranasal, inhalation-based and transdermal administration) and slow releasing microcarriers (for rectal, intramuscular or intravenous administration). The formulations can also contain a physiologically acceptable vehicle and optional adjuvants, flavorings, colorants and preservatives. Suitable physiologically acceptable vehicles include, for example, saline, sterile water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solutions. The specific dosage level of active ingredient will depend upon a number of factors, including, for example, biological activity of the particular preparation, age, body weight, sex and general health of the individual being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are given for purposes of illustration only in order that the present invention may be more fully understood. These examples are not intended to limit in any way the scope of the invention unless otherwise specifically indicated.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nA number of inventive cannabimimetic imidazole and pyrazole derivatives were prepared.

selectivity). As used herein, “binding affinity” is represented by the K\ni \nvalue which is the inhibition constant correlated with the concentration of an analog required to occupy the 50% of the total number (Bmax) of the receptors. The lower the K\ni \nvalue the higher the binding affinity. As used herein an analog is said to have “binding selectivity” if it has higher binding affinity for one receptor compared to the other receptor; e.g. a cannabinoid analog which has a K\ni \nof 0.1 nM for CBI and 10 nM for CB2, is 100 times more selective for the CBI receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the CBI receptor binding studies, membranes were prepared from rat forebrain membranes according to the procedure of P. R. Dodd et al, \nA Rapid Method for Preparing Synaptosomes: Comparison with Alternative Procedures\n, Brain Res., 107-118 (1981). The binding of the novel analogues to the CBI cannabinoid receptor was assessed as described in W. A. Devane et al, \nDetermination and Characterization of a Cannabinoid Receptor in a Rat Brain\n, Mol. Pharmacol., 34, 605-613 (1988) and A. Charalambous et al, 5′-\nazido Δ\n \n8−\n \n THC: A Novel Photoaffinity Label for the Cannabinoid Receptor\n, J. Med. Chem., 35, 3076-3079 (1992) with the following changes. The above articles are incorporated by reference herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMembranes, previously frozen at −80° C., were thawed on ice. To the stirred suspension was added three volumes of TME (25 mM Tris-HCl buffer, 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nand 1 mM EDTA) at a pH 7.4. The suspension was incubated at 4° C. for 30 min. At the end of the incubation, the membranes were pelleted and washed three times with TME.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe treated membranes were subsequently used in the binding assay described below. Approximately 30 μg of membranes were incubated in silanized 96-well microtiter plate with TME containing 0.1% essentially fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.8 nM [\n3\nH] CP-55,940, and various concentrations of test materials in a final volume of 200 μL. The assays were incubated for 1 hour at 30° C. and then immediately filtered using Packard Filtermate 196 harvester and Whatman GF/C filterplates and washed with wash buffer (TME) containing 0.5% BSA. Radioactivity was detected using MicroScint 20 scintillation cocktail added directly to the dried filterplates, and the filterplates were counted using a Packard Instruments Top-Count. Nonspecific binding was assessed using 100 nM CP-55,940. Data collected from three independent experiments performed with duplicate determinations was normalized between 100% and 0% specific binding for [\n3\nH] CP-55,940, determined using buffer and 100 nM CP-55,940. The normalized data was analyzed using a 4-parameter nonlinear logistic equation to yield IC\n50 \nvalues. Data from at least two independent experiments performed in duplicate was used to calculate IC\n50 \nvalues which were converted to K\ni \nvalues using the assumptions of Cheng et al, \nRelationship Between the Inhibition Constant \n(\nK\n \ni\n) \nand the concentration of Inhibitor which causes \n50% \nInhibition \n(\nIC\n \n50\n) \nof an Enzymatic Reaction\n, Biochem.

Silanized centrifuge tubes were used throughout to minimize receptor loss due to adsorption. The CB2 binding assay was conducted in the same manner as for the CB1 binding assay.
