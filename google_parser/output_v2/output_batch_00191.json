No. 61/062,909, filed Jan. 30, 2008. The disclosures of the aforementioned applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties for all purposes.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is related to substituted spirocyclic piperidine derivatives, their use as H\n3 \nantagonists/inverse agonists, processes for their preparation, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nPublications cited throughout this disclosure are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHistamine is a well established modulator of neuronal activity. At least four subtypes of histamine receptors have been reported in the literature—H\n1\n, H\n2\n, H\n3\n, H\n4\n. The histamine H\n3 \nreceptors play a key role in neurotransmission in the central nervous system. The H\n3 \nreceptor was discovered in 1983 originally on histamine-containing neurons where it was shown to function presynaptically, regulating the release and synthesis of the biogenic amine histamine (Arrang et al, 1983) now a well established neurotransmitter. H\n3 \nreceptors are predominately expressed in the brain, localizing to the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus and hypothalamus. H\n3 \nreceptors are also localized presynaptically on histaminergic nerve terminals and act as inhibitory autoreceptors (Alguacil and Perez-Garcia, 2003; Passani et al, 2004; Leurs at al, 2005; Celanire et al, 2005; Witkin and Nelson, 2004). When these receptors are activated by histamine, histamine release is inhibited. H\n3 \nreceptors can also be found in the periphery (skin, lung, cardiovascular system, intestine, GI tract, etc). H\n3 \nreceptors are also involved in presynaptic regulation of the release of acetylcholine, dopamine, GABA, glutamate and serotonin (see Repka-Ramirez, 2003; Chazot and Hann, 2001; Leurs et al, 1998). The H\n3 \nreceptor demonstrates a high degree of constitutive or spontaneous activity (e.g., receptor is active in the absence of agonist stimulation) in vitro and in vivo, thus, ligands to the receptor can display, agonist, neutral antagonist or inverse agonist effects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe location and function of histaminergic neurons in the CNS suggests that compounds interacting with the H\n3 \nreceptor may have utility in a number of therapeutic applications including narcolepsy or sleep/wake disorders, feeding behavior, eating disorders, obesity, cognition, arousal, memory, mood disorders, mood attention alteration, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease/dementia, schizophrenia, pain, stress, migraine, motion sickness, depression, psychiatric disorders and epilepsy (Leurs et al, 2005; Witkin and Nelson, 2004, Hancock and Fox 2004; Esbenshade et al. 2006). An H\n3 \nantagonist/inverse agonist could be important for gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory disorders such as asthma, inflammation, and myocardial infarction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOhtake et al. (US 2006/0178375 A1) disclosed compounds that reportedly exhibit histamine receptor H\n3 \nantagonist or inverse agonist activity and may be useful for the treatment or prevention of obesity, diabetes, hormonal secretion abnormality, or sleep disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCelanire et al.

As used herein, “prodrug” is intended to include any compounds which are converted by metabolic processes within the body of a subject to an active agent that has a formula within the scope of the present invention. Since prodrugs are known to enhance numerous desirable qualities of pharmaceuticals (e.g., solubility, bioavailability, manufacturing, etc.) the compounds of the present invention may be delivered in prodrug form. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in \nProdrugs\n, Sloane, K. B., Ed.; Marcel Dekker: New York, 1992, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is recognized that compounds of the present invention may exist in various stereoisomeric forms. As such, the compounds of the present invention include both diastereomers and enantiomers. The compounds are normally prepared as racemates and can conveniently be used as such, but individual enantiomers can be isolated or synthesized by conventional techniques if so desired. Such racemates and individual enantiomers and mixtures thereof form part of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is well known in the art how to prepare and isolate such optically active forms. Specific stereoisomers can be prepared by stereospecific synthesis using enantiomerically pure or enantiomerically enriched starting materials. The specific stereoisomers of either starting materials or products can be resolved and recovered by techniques known in the art, such as resolution of racemic forms, normal, reverse-phase, and chiral chromatography, recrystallization, enzymatic resolution, or fractional recrystallization of addition salts formed by reagents used for that purpose. Useful methods of resolving and recovering specific stereoisomers described in Eliel, E. L.; Wilen, S. H. \nStereochemistry of Organic Compounds\n; Wiley: New York, 1994, and Jacques, J, et al. \nEnantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions\n; Wiley: New York, 1981, each incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is further recognized that functional groups present on the compounds of Formula I may contain protecting groups. For example, the amino acid side chain substituents of the compounds of Formula I can be substituted with protecting groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl groups. Protecting groups are known per se as chemical functional groups that can be selectively appended to and removed from functionalities, such as hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups. These groups are present in a chemical compound to render such functionality inert to chemical reaction conditions to which the compound is exposed. Any of a variety of protecting groups may be employed with the present invention. Preferred groups for protecting lactams include silyl groups such as t-butyldimethylsilyl (“TBDMS”), dimethoxybenzhydryl (“DMB”), acyl, benzyl (“Bn”), and methoxybenzyl groups. Preferred groups for protecting hydroxy groups include TBS, acyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (“CBZ”), t-butyloxycarbonyl (“Boc”), and methoxymethyl. Many other standard protecting groups employed by one skilled in the art can be found in Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M., “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis” 2d. Ed., Wiley & Sons, 1991.\n\n\n \nSynthesis\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be prepared in a number of methods well known to those skilled in the art, including, but not limited to those described below, or through modifications of these methods by applying standard techniques known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. All processes disclosed in association with the present invention are contemplated to be practiced on any scale, including milligram, gram, multigram, kilogram, multikilogram or commercial industrial scale.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe general routes to prepare the examples shown herein are shown in the general Schemes 1-9. The reagents and starting materials are commercially available, or readily synthesized by well-known techniques by one of ordinary skill in the arts. All substituents in the synthetic Schemes, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined.\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nOther features of the invention will become apparent in the course of the following descriptions of exemplary embodiments as shown below.

The rat H\n3 \nreceptor cDNA was PCR amplified from reverse-transcribed RNA pooled from rat thalamus, hypothalamus, striatum and prefrontal cortex with a sequence corresponding to by #338-1672 of Genbank file #NM\n—\n053506, encoding the entire 445-amino-acid rat histamine H\n3 \nreceptor. This was engineered into the pIRES-neo3 mammalian expression vector, which was stably transfected into the CHO-A3 cell line (Euroscreen, Belgium), followed by clonal selection by limiting dilution. Cells were harvested and cell pellets were frozen (−80° C.). Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 with 5 nM EDTA and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitior Tablets, Roche Diagnostics). Cells were disrupted using a polytron cell homogenizer and the suspension was centrifuged at 1000×g for 10 minutes at 4° C. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant centrifuged at 40,000×g for 30 min at 4° C. This membrane pellet was washed in membrane buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 with 0.6 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nand protease inhibitors, recentrifuged as above and the final pellet resuspended in membrane buffer plus 250 mM sucrose and frozen at −80° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadioligand Binding. Membranes were resuspended in 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.1% BSA. The membrane suspensions (10 μg protein per well) were incubated in a 96 well microtiter plate with [\n3\nH]-N-alpha-methylhistamine (approximately 1 nM final concentration), test compounds at various concentrations (0.01 nM-30 μM) and scintillation proximity beads (Perkin Elmer, FlashBlueGPCR Scintillating Beads) in a final volume of 80 μl for 4 hours at room temperature, protected from light. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM clobenpropit. Radioligand bound to receptor, and therefore in proximity to the scintillation beads, was measured using a MicroBeta scintillation counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGTPγS Binding. Membranes were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 containing 1 mM EDTA, 0.17 mg/ml dithiothreitol, 100 mM NaCl, 30 μg/ml saponin and 5 mM MgCl\n2\n. For measurement of inverse agonist activity, increasing concentrations of test compounds were incubated in a 96 well microtiter plate with 10 μg/well membrane protein, 5 μM GDP, scintillation proximity beads (Perkin Elmer, FlashBlueGPCR Scintillating Beads) and [\n35\nS]-GTPγS (0.1 nM final concentration). Following incubation for 45 minutes in the dark at room temperature, the microtiter plate was centrifuged at 1000×g for 5 minutes and radioactivity bound to the membranes was counted using a MicroBeta scintillation counter. Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of 10 μM GTP. A decrease in bound [\n35\nS]-GTPγS is indicative of H\n3 \nreceptor inverse agonist activity in this assay. Antagonist activity of test compounds was determined in a similar experiment under the following conditions. Membranes were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 containing: 1 mM EDTA, 0.17 mg/ml dithiothreitol, 200 mM NaCl, 30 μg/ml saponin and 20 mM MgCl\n2\n.

The microtiter plates were incubated and processed as described above. A decrease in R-alpha-methylhistamine stimulated [\n35\nS]-GTPγS binding is indicative of H\n3 \nreceptor antagonist activity in this assay.\n\n\n \nHuman H\n3 \nAssays:\n\n\n \n \n \nMethods: CHO cells stably expressing the human H\n3 \nreceptor (GenBank: NM\n—\n007232) were harvested and cell pellets were frozen (−80° C.).

Cells were disrupted using a polytron cell homogenizer and the suspension was centrifuged at 1000×g for 10 minutes at 4° C. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant centrifuged at 40,000×g for 30 min at 4° C. This membrane pellet was washed in membrane buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 with 0.6 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl\n2 \nand protease inhibitors, recentrifuged as above and the final pellet resuspended in membrane buffer plus 250 mM sucrose and frozen at −80° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRadioligand Binding. Membranes were resuspended in 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 0.1% BSA. The membrane suspensions (10 μg protein per well) were incubated in a 96 well microtiter plate with [\n3\nH]-N-alpha-methylhistamine (approximately 1 nM final concentration), test compounds at various concentrations (0.01 nM-30 μM) and scintillation proximity beads (Perkin Elmer, FlashBlueGPCR Scintillating Beads) in a final volume of 80 μl for 4 hours at room temperature, protected from light. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM clobenpropit. Radioligand bound to receptor, and therefore in proximity to the scintillation beads, was measured using a MicroBeta scintillation counter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGTPγS Binding. Membranes were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 containing 1 mM EDTA, 0.17 mg/ml dithiothreitol, 100 mM NaCl, 30 μg/ml saponin and 5 mM MgCl\n2\n. For measurement of inverse agonist activity, increasing concentrations of test compounds were incubated in a 96 well microtiter plate with 10 μg/well membrane protein, 5 μM GDP, scintillation proximity beads (Perkin Elmer, FlashBlueGPCR Scintillating Beads) and [\n35\nS]-GTPγS (0.1 nM final concentration). Following incubation for 45 minutes in the dark at room temperature, the microtiter plate was centrifuged at 1000×g for 5 minutes and radioactivity bound to the membranes was counted using a MicroBeta scintillation counter. Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of 10 μM GTP. A decrease in bound [\n35\nS]-GTPγS is indicative of H\n3 \nreceptor inverse agonist activity in this assay. Antagonist activity of test compounds was determined in a similar experiment under the following conditions. Membranes were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 containing: 1 mM EDTA, 0.17 mg/ml dithiothreitol, 200 mM NaCl, 30 μg/ml saponin and 20 mM MgCl\n2\n. The membranes were incubated at 10 μg/well membrane protein in a microtiter plate with increasing concentrations of test compounds, 20 μM GDP, scintillation proximity beads and [\n35\nS]-GTPγS (0.1 nM final concentration) plus 30 nM R-alpha-methylhistamine. The microtiter plates were incubated and processed as described above. A decrease in R-alpha-methylhistamine stimulated [\n35\nS]-GTPγS binding is indicative of H\n3 \nreceptor antagonist activity in this assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther assays that may be used in connection with the present invention are set forth below.

Formulation\n\n\n \n \n \nFor therapeutic purposes, the compounds of the present invention can be administered by any means that results in the contact of the active agent with the agent's site of action in the body of the subject. The compounds may be administered by any conventional means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals, either as individual therapeutic agents or in combination with other therapeutic agents, such as, for example, analgesics. The compounds of the present invention are preferably administered in therapeutically effective amounts for the treatment of the diseases and disorders described herein to a subject in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA therapeutically effective amount can be readily determined by the attending diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, by the use of conventional techniques. The effective dose will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, the formulation of the active agent with appropriate excipients, and the route of administration. Typically, the compounds are administered at lower dosage levels, with a gradual increase until the desired effect is achieved.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical dose ranges are from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, with a preferred dose from about 0.01 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg of body weight per day. A preferred daily dose for adult humans includes about 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg, and an equivalent dose in a human child. The compounds may be administered in one or more unit dose forms. The unit dose ranges from about 1 to about 500 mg administered one to four times a day, preferably from about 10 mg to about 300 mg, two times a day. In an alternate method of describing an effective dose, an oral unit dose is one that is necessary to achieve a blood serum level of about 0.05 to 20 μg/ml in a subject, and preferably about 1 to 20 μg/ml.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions by admixture with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The excipients are selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice, as described, for example, in \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n20\nth \ned.; Gennaro, A. R., Ed.; Lippincott Williams & Wilkins: Philadelphia, Pa., 2000. The compositions may be formulated to control and/or delay the release of the active agent(s), as in fast-dissolve, modified-release, or sustained-release formulations. Such controlled-release, or extended-release compositions may utilize, for example biocompatible, biodegradable lactide polymers, lactide/glycolide copolymers, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene copolymers, or other solid or semisolid polymeric matrices known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions can be prepared for administration by oral means; parenteral means, including intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous routes; topical or transdermal means; transmucosal means, including rectal, vaginal, sublingual and buccal routes; ophthalmic means; or inhalation means. Preferably the compositions are prepared for oral administration, particularly in the form of tablets, capsules or syrups; for parenteral administration, particularly in the form of liquid solutions, suspensions or emulsions; for intranasal administration, particularly in the form of powders, nasal drops, or aerosols; or for topical administration, such as creams, ointments, solutions, suspensions aerosols, powders and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor oral administration, the tablets, pills, powders, capsules, troches and the like can contain one or more of the following: diluents or fillers such as starch, or cellulose; binders such as microcrystalline cellulose, gelatins, or polyvinylpyrrolidones; disintegrants such as starch or cellulose derivatives; lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate; glidants such as colloidal silicon dioxide; sweetening agents such as sucrose or saccharin; or flavoring agents such as peppermint or cherry flavoring. Capsules may contain any of the afore listed excipients, and may additionally contain a semi-solid or liquid carrier, such as a polyethylene glycol. The solid oral dosage forms may have coatings of sugar, shellac, or enteric agents. Liquid preparations may be in the form of aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, elixirs, etc., or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as surfactants, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, diluents, sweetening and flavoring agents, dyes and preservatives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may also be administered parenterally. The pharmaceutical forms acceptable for injectable use include, for example, sterile aqueous solutions, or suspensions. Aqueous carriers include mixtures of alcohols and water, buffered media, and the like. Nonaqueous solvents include alcohols and glycols, such as ethanol, and polyethylene glycols; oils, such as vegetable oils; fatty acids and fatty acid esters, and the like. Other components can be added including surfactants; such as hydroxypropylcellulose; isotonic agents, such as sodium chloride; fluid and nutrient replenishers; electrolyte replenishers; agents which control the release of the active compounds, such as aluminum monostearate, and various co-polymers; antibacterial agents, such as chlorobutanol, or phenol; buffers, and the like. The parenteral preparations can be enclosed in ampules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials. Other potentially useful parenteral delivery systems for the active compounds include ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer particles, osmotic pumps, implantable infusion systems, and liposomes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther possible modes of administration include formulations for inhalation, which include such means as dry powder, aerosol, or drops. They may be aqueous solutions containing, for example, polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, glycocholate and deoxycholate, or oily solutions for administration in the form of nasal drops, or as a gel to be applied intranasally. Formulations for topical use are in the form of an ointment, cream, or gel. Typically these forms include a carrier, such as petrolatum, lanolin, stearyl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, or their combinations, and either an emulsifying agent, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, or a gelling agent, such as tragacanth. Formulations suitable for transdermal administration can be presented as discrete patches, as in a reservoir or microreservoir system, adhesive diffusion-controlled system or a matrix dispersion-type system. Formulations for buccal administration include, for example lozenges or pastilles and may also include a flavored base, such as sucrose or acacia, and other excipients such as glycocholate. Formulations suitable for rectal administration are preferably presented as unit-dose suppositories, with a solid based carrier, such as cocoa butter, and may include a salicylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs those skilled in the art will appreciate, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein, and the scope of the invention is intended to encompass all such variations.\n\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nAlguacil L.
