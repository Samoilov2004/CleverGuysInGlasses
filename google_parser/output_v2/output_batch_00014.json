One important class of these proteins is the sigma receptor, a cell surface receptor of the central nervous system (CNS) which may be related to the dysphoric, hallucinogenic and cardiac stimulant effects of opioids. From studies of the biology and function of sigma receptors, evidence has been presented that sigma receptor ligands may be useful in the treatment of psychosis and movement disorders such as dystonia and tardive dyskinesia, and motor disturbances associated with Huntington's chorea or Tourette's syndrome and in Parkinson's disease (Walker, J. M. et al, \nPharmacological Reviews, \n1990, 42, 355). It has been reported that the known sigma receptor ligand rimcazole clinically shows effects in the treatment of psycosis (Snyder, S. H., Largent, B. L. J. \nNeuropsychiatry\n 1989, 1, 7). The sigma binding sites have preferential affinity for the dextrorotatory isomers of certain opiate benzomorphans, such as (+)—SKF 10047, (+)-cyclazocine, and (+)-pentazocine and also for some narcoleptics such as haloperidol. The sigma receptor has at least two subtypes, which may be discriminated by stereoselective isomers of these pharmacoactive drugs. SKF 10047 has nanomolar affinity for the sigma-1 site, and has micromolar affinity for the sigma-2 site. Haloperidol has similar affinities for both subtypes. Endogenous sigma ligands are not known, although progesterone has been suggested to be one of them. Possible sigma-site-mediated drug effects include modulation of glutamate receptor function, neurotransmitter response, neuroprotection, behavior, and cognition (Quirion, R. et al. \nTrends Pharmacol. Sci., \n1992, 13:85-86). Most studies have implied that sigma binding sites (receptors) are plasmalemmal elements of the signal transduction cascade. Drugs reported to be selective sigma ligands have been evaluated as antipsychotics (Hanner, M. et al. \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci, \n1996, 93:8072-8077). The existence of sigma receptors in the CNS, immune and endocrine systems have suggested a likelihood that it may serve as link between the three systems.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn view of the potential therapeutic applications of agonists or antagonists of the sigma receptor, a great effort has been directed to find selective ligands. Thus, the prior art discloses different sigma receptor ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInternational Patent Application No. WO 91/09594 generically describes a broad class of sigma receptor ligands some of which are 4-phenylpiperidine, -tetrahydro-pyridine or -piperazine compounds having an optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy or alkoxyalkyl substituent on the ring N-atom. The terms aryl and heteroaryl are defined by mention of a number of such substituents.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEuropean patent publication No. EP 0 414 289 A1 generically discloses a class of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-spiro[naphthalene-1,4′-piperidine] and 1,4-dihydro-spiro [naphthalene-1,4′-piperidine] derivatives substituted at the piperidine N-atom with a hydrocarbon group alleged to have selective sigma receptor antagonistic activity. The term hydrocarbon, as defined in said patent, covers all possible straight chained, cyclic, heterocyclic, etc. groups. However, only compounds having benzyl, phenethyl, cycloalkylmethyl, furyl- or thienylmethyl or lower alkyl or alkenyl as the hydrocarbon substituent at the piperidine nitrogen atom are specifically disclosed. The compounds are stated to displace tritiated di-tolyl guanidine (DTG) from sigma sites with potencies better than 200 nM. As a particularly preferred compound is mentioned 1′-benzyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-spiro[naphthalene-1,4′-piperidine].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEuropean patent publication No. EP 0 445 974 A2 generically describes the corresponding spiro[indane-1,4′-piperidine] and spiro[benzocycloheptene-5,4′-piperidine] derivatives. Again the compounds are only stated to displace tritiated di-tolyl guanidine (DTG) from sigma sites with potencies better than 200 nM\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEuropean patent Application No. EP 0 431 943 A2 relates to a further extremely broad class of spiropiperidine compounds substituted at the piperidine N-atom and claimed to be useful as antiarrhythmics and for impaired cardiac pump function. The said application exemplifies several compounds, the majority of which contain an oxo and/or a sulfonylamino substituent in the Spiro cyclic ring system. Of the remainder compounds, the main part has another polar substituent attached to the Spiro nucleus and/or they have some polar substituents in the substituent on the piperidine N-atom. No suggestion or indication of effect of the compounds on the sigma receptor is given.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThere is still a need to find compounds that have pharmacological activity towards the sigma receptor, being both effective and selective, and having good “drugability” properties, i.e. good pharmaceutical properties related to administration, distribution, metabolism and excretion.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nWe have now found a family of pyrazol derivatives which are particularly selective inhibitors of the sigma receptor. The compounds present a pyrazol group which is condensed with a cycloalkyl ring having 5, 6 or 7 carbon atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one aspect the invention is directed to a compound of the formula I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein\n\n \n \n \n \n \nR\n1 \nis selected from the group formed by hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted arylalkyl, and substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclylalkyl;\n \nR\n2 \nis selected from the group formed by hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclyl, substituted or unsubstituted arylalkyl, and substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclylalkyl;\n \nR\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare independently selected from the group formed by hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted arylalkyl and substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclylalkyl or, together, R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nform a 3 to 6 substituted or unsubstituted member ring;\n \nR\n5 \nand R\n6 \nare independently selected from the group formed by hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, substituted or unsubstituted arylalkyl and substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclylalkyl or, R\n5 \nand\n \nR\n6 \ntogether, form a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclyl having 3 to 7 atoms in the ring;\n \nn is selected from 0, 1 and 2;\n \nm is selected from 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4;\n \nthe dotted line ----- is either a single or a double bond;\n\n\nwith the proviso that when R\n1 \nis phenyl, R\n2 \nis H, the dotted line ----- is a double bond, m is 1, and R\n5 \nand R\n6 \nform a 2,5-dioxopyrrolidine or a 5-ethoxy-2-oxo-pyrrolidine; then R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare not both at the same time H or methyl;\n\n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, isomer, prodrug or solvate thereof.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment R\n2 \nis preferably hydrogen or alkyl; more preferably hydrogen. It is also preferred that m is 1 or 2, and also that n is 0 or 1.

Moreover, it is also preferred that R\n5 \nand R\n6 \ntogether form a substituted or unsubstituted heterocyclyl having 3 to 7 atoms in the ring, in particular morpholin-4-yl, 2,6-dimethylmorpholin-4-yl, piperidin-1-yl, 4-phenylpiperidin-1-yl, 3-phenylpiperidin-1-yl, 4-benzylpiperazin-1-yl, 4-phenyl-piperazin-1-yl, 2-[spiro[isobenzofuran-1(3H), 4′-piperidin]-1′-yl, azepan-1-yl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinolin-2-yl, pyrrolidin-1-yl, 3-phenyl-pyrrolidin-1-yl, isoindolin-2-yl or imidazol-1-yl; especially when R\n2 \nis hydrogen, m is 1 and n is 1; more especially when R\n3 \nand R\n4 \nare both hydrogen; and even more especially when R\n1 \nis substituted or unsubstituted phenyl.

For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of a hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a \n13\nC— or \n14\nC— enriched carbon or \n15\nN-enriched nitrogen are within the scope of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, prodrugs” refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, solvate, or any other compound which, upon administration to the recipient is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound as described herein. However, it will be appreciated that non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts also fall within the scope of the invention since those may be useful in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The preparation of salts, prodrugs and derivatives can be carried out by methods known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor instance, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds provided herein are synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts are, for example, prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent or in a mixture of the two. Generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone or acetonitrile are preferred. Examples of the acid addition salts include mineral acid addition salts such as, for example, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, nitrate, phosphate, and organic acid addition salts such as, for example, acetate, maleate, fumarate, citrate, oxalate, succinate, tartrate, malate, mandelate, methanesulphonate and p-toluenesulphonate. Examples of the alkali addition salts include inorganic salts such as, for example, sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, magnesium, aluminium and lithium salts, and organic alkali salts such as, for example, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, N,N-dialkylenethanolamine, triethanolamine, glucamine and basic aminoacids salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParticularly favored derivatives or prodrugs are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of this invention when such compounds are administered to a patient (e.g., by allowing an orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a biological compartment (e.g., the brain or lymphatic system) relative to the parent species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny compound that is a prodrug of a compound of formula (I) is within the scope of the invention. The term “prodrug” is used in its broadest sense and encompasses those derivatives that are converted in vivo to the compounds of the invention. Such derivatives would readily occur to those skilled in the art, and include, depending on the functional groups present in the molecule and without limitation, the following derivatives of the present compounds: esters, amino acid esters, phosphate esters, metal salts sulfonate esters, carbamates, and amides. Examples of well known methods of producing a prodrug of a given acting compound are known to those skilled in the art and can be found e.g. in Krogsgaard-Larsen et al. “Textbook of Drug design and Discovery” Taylor & Francis (april 2002).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be in crystalline form either as free compounds or as solvates and it is intended that both forms are within the scope of the present invention. Methods of solvation are generally known within the art. Suitable solvates are pharmaceutically acceptable solvates. In a particular embodiment the solvate is a hydrate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) or their salts or solvates are preferably in pharmaceutically acceptable or substantially pure form. By pharmaceutically acceptable form is meant, inter alia, having a pharmaceutically acceptable level of purity excluding normal pharmaceutical additives such as diluents and carriers, and including no material considered toxic at normal dosage levels. Purity levels for the drug substance are preferably above 50%, more preferably above 70%, most preferably above 90%. In a preferred embodiment it is above 95% of the compound of formula (I), or of its salts, solvates or prodrugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention represented by the above described formula (I) may include enantiomers depending on the presence of chiral centres or isomers depending on the presence of double bonds (e.g. Z, E). The single isomers, enantiomers or diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof fall within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I) defined above can be obtained by available synthetic procedures. For example, they can be prepared by the coupling of a compound of Formula (II):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nin which R\n1\n-R\n4\n, m and n are as defined above in formula (I), and X is a leaving group, preferably chlorine or pyridinium, with a compound of Formula (III):\n\n\n \n \n \nHNR\n5\nR\n6\n  (III)\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nin which R\n5 \nand R\n6 \nare as defined above in formula (I)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe reaction of compounds of formulas (II) and (III) is preferably carried out in an aprotic solvent, but not limited to, such as dimethylformamide (DMF) in the presence of an inorganic base, such as K\n2\nCO\n3\n. Compounds of Formula (III) are commercially available or can be prepared by conventional methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following schemes I to VI illustrate some methods for preparing the compounds of formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethod A:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula (I), in particular the compounds of formula (Ia), can be obtained according to the synthetic process described by scheme I:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFollowing Method A, the compounds of formula (VII) are prepared according to methods known from the literature.

Suitable dose forms for oral administration may be tablets, capsules, syrops or solutions and may contain conventional excipients known in the art such as binding agents, for example syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers, for example lactose, sugar, maize starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine; tabletting lubricants, for example magnesium stearate; disintegrants, for example starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium starch glycollate or microcrystalline cellulose; or pharmaceutically acceptable wetting agents such as sodium lauryl sulfate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solid oral compositions may be prepared by conventional methods of blending, filling or tabletting. Repeated blending operations may be used to distribute the active agent throughout those compositions employing large quantities of fillers. Such operations are conventional in the art. The tablets may for example be prepared by wet or dry granulation and optionally coated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice, in particular with an enteric coating.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions may also be adapted for parenteral administration, such as sterile solutions, suspensions or lyophilized products in the appropriate unit dosage form. Adequate excipients can be used, such as bulking agents, buffering agents or surfactants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mentioned formulations will be prepared using standard methods such as those described or referred to in the Spanish and US Pharmacopoeias and similar reference texts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the compounds or compositions of the present invention may be by any suitable method, such as intravenous infusion, oral preparations, and intraperitoneal and intravenous administration. Oral administration is preferred because of the convenience for the patient and the chronic character of the diseases to be treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally an effective administered amount of a compound of the invention will depend on the relative efficacy of the compound chosen, the severity of the disorder being treated and the weight of the sufferer. However, active compounds will typically be administered once or more times a day for example 1, 2, 3 or 4 times daily, with typical total daily doses in the range of from 0.1 to 1000 mg/kg/day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds and compositions of this invention may be used with other drugs to provide a combination therapy.

The following protocols were followed:\n\n\n \nSigma-1\n\n\n \n \n \nBrain membrane preparation and binding assays for the σ1-receptor were performed as described (DeHaven-Hudkins et al., 1992) with some modifications. In brief, guinea pig brains were homogenized in 10 vols. (w/v) of Tris-HCl 50 mM 0.32 M sucrose, pH 7.4, with a Kinematica Polytron PT 3000 at 15000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4° C. and the supernatants collected and centrifuged again at 48000 g for 15 min at 4° C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4), incubated at 37° C. for 30 min, and centrifuged at 48000 g for 20 min at 4° C. Following this, the pellet was resuspended in fresh Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) and stored on ice until use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach assay tube contained 10 μL of [\n3\nH](+)-pentazocine (final concentration of 0.5 nM), 900 μL of the tissue suspension to a final assay volume of 1 mL and a final tissue concentration of approximately 30 mg tissue net weight/mL. Non-specific binding was defined by addition of a final concentration of 1 μM haloperidol. All tubes were incubated at 37° C. for 150 min before termination of the reaction by rapid filtration over Schleicher & Schuell GF 3362 glass fibre filters [previously soaked in a solution of 0.5% polyethylenimine for at least 1 h]. Filters were then washed with four times with 4 mL of cold Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). Following addition of scintillation cocktail, the samples were allowed to equilibrate overnight. The amount of bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry using a Wallac Winspectral 1414 liquid scintillation counter. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (1951).\n\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nDeHaven-Hudkins, D. L., L. C. Fleissner, and F. Y.

In brief, brains from sigma receptor type I (sigma-1) knockout mice were homogenized in a volume of 10 mL/g tissue net weight of ice-cold 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 320 mM sucrose (Tris-sucrose buffer) with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (10 strokes at 500 r.p.m.) The homogenates were then centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4° C., and the supernatants were saved. The pellets were resuspended by vortexing in 2 mL/g ice-cold Tris-sucrose buffer and centrifuged again at 1000 g for 10 min. The combined 1000 g supernatants were centrifuged at 31000 g for 15 min at 4° C. The pellets were resuspended by vortexing in 3 mL/g 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and the suspension was kept at 25° C. for 15 min. Following centrifugation at 31000 g for 15 min, the pellets were resuspended by gentle Potter Elvehjem homogenization to a volume of 1.53 mL/g in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay tubes contained 10 μL of [\n3\nH]-DTG (final concentration of 3 nM), 400 μL of the tissue suspension (5.3 mL/g in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) to a final assay volume of 0.5 mL.

After habituation mice were according to \nFIG. 1\n first treated with the test-compound (or solvent in controls). Then 1 capsaicin (1% DMSO) is injected into their paw resulting in developing pain in the effected paw. The effected paw is then treated with a mechanical stimulus and the latency time before the paw is withdrawn is measured.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nUsing this pharmacological test the compounds according to example 2, 58, 62 and 77 showed a clear antiallodynic effect. With a dosage of 32 mg/kg at least 50% pain relieve was achieved, while the compound according to example 58 as the most potent reached 100% analgesia with 2 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of all these 4 tested compounds could be reversed by applying 40 mg/kg PRE084 (a well-known Sigma Agonist), assuring that the observed effect was due to the sigma binding.\n\n\n \nEffect on Carrageenan in Development of Thermal Hyperalgesia\n\n\n \n \n \nSome compounds were also evaluated for antinociceptive activity in the carrageenan-induced thermal hyperalgesia model in mice. In this model, two hours after carrageenan injection into the paw, the plantar test was used to assess thermal hyperalgesia according to the method described by Hargreaves et al. (1988). The compounds of Examples 58 and 62.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 2\n shows the test protocol for all tests, showing that the differences lie in the use of Carrageenan instead of Capsaicin and of Hargreaves measurements instead of von Frey filaments.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBoth compounds were highly active in this model, with the compound according to example 58 showing nearly 90% analgesia with 10 mg/kg and 60% with 2.5 mg/kg. The compound according to example 62 showed 90% analgesia with 40 mg/kg, 75% with 10 mg/kg and 40% with 2.5 mg/kg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of both compounds could be reversed by applying 40 mg/kg PRE084.\n\n\n \nSciatic Nerve\n\n\n \n \n \nIn addition, significant inhibition of mechanical allodynia was also evidenced for the compound according to example 62 at 30 mg/kg s.c. in the partial sciatic nerve ligation model (Seltzer et al., 1990) of neuropathic pain in mice. The von Frey test was used to assess mechanical allodynia 11-13 days after surgery.\n\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nHargreaves K, Dubner R, Brown F, Flores C, Joris J. “A new and sensitive method for measuring thermal nociception in cutaneous hyperalgesia.” \nPain \n1988; 32:77-88.\n\n\nSeltzer Z, Dubner R, Shir Y. “A novel behavioral model of neuropathic pain disorders produced in rats by partial sciatic nerve injury.” \nPain \n1990; 43:205-218."
