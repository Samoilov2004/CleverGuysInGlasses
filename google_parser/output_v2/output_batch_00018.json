Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 60/946,803; filed Jun. 28, 2007, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates, in part, to therapeutic antibodies and methods of use thereof.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe insulin-like growth factors, also known as somatomedins, include insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) (Klapper, et al., (1983) Endocrinol. 112:2215 and Rinderknecht, et al., (1978) Febs. Lett. 89:283). These growth factors exert mitogenic activity on various cell types, including tumor cells (Macaulay, (1992) Br. J. Cancer 65:311), by binding to a common receptor named the insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGF1R) (Sepp-Lorenzino, (1998) Breast Cancer Research and Treatment 47:235). Interaction of IGFs with IGF1R activates the receptor by triggering autophosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosine residues (Butler, et al., (1998) Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology 121:19). Once activated, IGF1R, in turn, phosphorylates intracellular targets to activate cellular signaling pathways. This receptor activation is critical for stimulation of tumor cell growth and survival. Therefore, inhibition of IGF1R activity represents a valuable potential method to treat or prevent growth of human cancers and other proliferative diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral lines of evidence indicate that IGF-I, IGF-II and their receptor IGF1R are important mediators of the malignant phenotype. Plasma levels of IGF-I have been found to be the strongest predictor of prostate cancer risk (Chan, et al., (1998) Science 279:563) and similar epidemiological studies strongly link plasma IGF-I levels with breast, colon and lung cancer risk.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverexpression of Insulin-like Growth Factor Receptor-1 has also been demonstrated in several cancer cell lines and tumor tissues. IGF1R is overexpressed in 40% of all breast cancer cell lines (Pandini, et al., (1999) Cancer Res. 5:1935) and in 15% of lung cancer cell lines. In breast cancer tumor tissue, IGF1R is overexpressed 6-14 fold and IGF1R exhibits 2-4 fold higher kinase activity as compared to normal tissue (Webster, et al., (1996) Cancer Res. 56:2781 and Pekonen, et al., (1998) Cancer Res. 48:1343). Ninety percent of colorectal cancer tissue biopsies exhibit elevated IGF1R levels wherein the extent of IGF1R expression is correlated with the severity of the disease. Analysis of primary cervical cancer cell cultures and cervical cancer cell lines revealed 3- and 5-fold overexpression of IGF1R, respectively, as compared to normal ectocervical cells (Steller, et al., (1996) Cancer Res. 56:1762). Expression of IGF1R in synovial sarcoma cells also correlated with an aggressive phenotype (i.e., metastasis and high rate of proliferation; Xie, et al., (1999) Cancer Res. 59:3588). Furthermore, acromegaly, a slowly developing disease, is caused by hypersecretion of growth hormone and IGF-I (Ben-Schlomo, et al., (2001) Endocrin. Metab. Clin. North. Am. 30:565-583). Antagonism of IGF1R function may be helpful in treating the disease. There remains a need in the art for IGF1R antagonist therapies for treating or preventing such disease and disorders. Of particular utility are anti-IGF1R antibody based therapies.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention provides an isolated antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that binds specifically to IGF1R comprising one or more members selected from the group consisting of: (a) CDR-H1, CDR-H2 and CDR-H3 of the variable region of antibody 2C6; (b) CDR-H1, CDR-H2 and CDR-H3 of the variable region of antibody 9H2; (c) CDR-L1, CDR-L2 and CDR-L3 of the variable region of antibody 2C6; and (d) CDR-L1, CDR-L2 and CDR-L3 of the variable region of antibody 9H2 (e.g., as defined by the Kabat or Chothia methods as discussed herein).

In an embodiment of the invention, the antibody is 2C6 or 9H2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibodies include whole antibodies (e.g., IgG, preferably, IgG1 or IgG4). Antigen-binding fragments of antibodies include Fab antibody fragments, F(ab)\n2 \nantibody fragments, Fv antibody fragments, single chain Fv antibody fragments and dsFv antibody fragments which bind to an antigen such as IGF1R or a fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “IGF1R”, “IGFR1” “Insulin-like Growth Factor Receptor-I” and “Insulin-like Growth Factor Receptor, type I” are well known in the art. Although IGF1R may be from any organism, it is, in an embodiment of the invention, from an animal, such as a mammal (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, sheep or dog), e.g., a human. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of a typical human IGF1R precursor has the Genbank Accession No. X04434 or NM\n—\n000875 (SEQ ID NO: 17). Cleavage of the precursor (e.g., between amino acids 710 and 711) produces an α-subunit and a β-subunit which associate to form a mature receptor. In particular embodiments of the invention, amino acids 30-902, from the full length IGF1R polypeptide are used as an antigen for generation of anti-IGF1R antibodies. The term “sIGF1R” or “soluble IGF1R” includes any soluble fragment of IGF1R (e.g., human IGF1R), e.g., a fragment from which the receptor trans-membrane region has been deleted, e.g., amino acids 30-902 of SEQ ID NO: 17, e.g., amino acids 1-932 of IGF1R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “IGF-I” “Insulin-like Growth Factor-I” and “Insulin-like Growth Factor, type I” are also well known in the art. The terms “IGF-II” “Insulin-like Growth Factor-II” and “Insulin-like Growth Factor, type II” are also well known in the art. Although IGF-I or IGF-II may be from any organism, they are, in an embodiment of the invention, from an animal, such as a mammal (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, sheep or dog) such as a human. The nucleic acid and amino acid sequence of typical, human IGF-I and IGF-II have the Genbank Accession No. XM\n—\n052648 and NM\n—\n000612, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “isolated” or the like refers to the purification status of a substance, such as an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof and in such a context means the substance has been purified from other biological substances (e.g., components of a cell in which the substance is produced) to any degree whatsoever. In an embodiment of the invention, the substance is substantially free of other biological molecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, or other material such as cellular debris and growth media. In an embodiment of the invention, an isolated substance has been removed from other contaminating substances essentially completely.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acid sequence of the variable region of human, monoclonal anti-IGF1R antibodies of the invention are summarized in Table 1. The present invention includes any isolated polypeptide set forth in Table 1 below (including mature fragments thereof which lack a signal peptide) along with any isolated polynucleotide encoding such a polypeptide or fragment and any vector (e.g., a recombinant vector such as a plasmid) comprising such a polynucleotide and any isolated host cell comprising such a vector.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of amino acid and nucleotide sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSequence Description\n\n\nSEQ ID NO:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody 2C6 heavy chain variable region\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2C6 CDR-H1\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2C6 CDR-H2\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2C6 CDR-H3\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody 2C6 light chain variable region\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2C6 CDR-L1\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2C6 CDR-L2\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2C6 CDR-L3\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody 9H2 heavy chain variable region\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9H2 CDR-H1\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9H2 CDR-H2\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9H2 CDR-H3\n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAntibody 9H2 light chain variable region\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9H2 CDR-L1\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9H2 CDR-L2\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9H2 CDR-L3\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman IGF1R\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n15H12/19D12 anti-IGF1R antibody chains\n\n\n18-23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAntibodies\n\n\n \n \n \nImmunoglobulin variable regions of the present invention are set forth below.

Examples of antibody antigen-binding fragments include, but are not limited to, Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)\n2\n, and Fv fragments; diabodies; single-chain antibody molecules, e.g., sc-Fv; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. Typically, a binding fragment or derivative retains at least 10% of its IGF1R binding activity when that activity is expressed on a molar basis. In an embodiment of the invention, a binding fragment or derivative retains at least 20%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 100% or more of the IGF1R binding affinity as the parental antibody. It is also intended that an IGF1R binding fragment can include conservative amino acid substitutions (referred to as “conservative variants” of the antibody) that do not substantially alter its biologic activity. The term “binding compound” refers to both antibodies and binding fragments thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “Fab fragment” is comprised of one light chain and the C\nH\n1 and variable regions of one heavy chain. The heavy chain of a Fab molecule cannot form a disulfide bond with another heavy chain molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn “Fc” region contains two heavy chain fragments comprising the C\nH\n1 and C\nH\n2 domains of an antibody. The two heavy chain fragments are held together by two or more disulfide bonds and by hydrophobic interactions of the C\nH\n3 domains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “Fab′ fragment” contains one light chain and a portion of one heavy chain that contains the V\nH \ndomain and the C\nH\n1 domain and also the region between the C\nH\n1 and C\nH\n2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond can be formed between the two heavy chains of two Fab′ fragments to form a F(ab′)\n2 \nmolecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment” contains two light chains and two heavy chains containing a portion of the constant region between the C\nH\n1 and C\nH\n2 domains, such that an interchain disulfide bond is formed between the two heavy chains. A F(ab′)\n2 \nfragment thus is composed of two Fab′ fragments that are held together by a disulfide bond between the two heavy chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Disulfide stabilized Fv fragments” and “dsFv” include molecules having a variable heavy chain (V\nH\n) and/or a variable light chain (V\nL\n) which are linked by a disulfide bridge.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe “Fv region” comprises the variable regions from both the heavy and light chains, but lacks the constant regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “single-chain Fv” or “scFv” antibody refers to antibody fragments comprising the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains of an antibody, wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally, the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the V\nH \nand V\nL \ndomains which enables the V\nH \nand V\nL \nchains to pair and form a binding site (e.g., 5-12 residues long). For a review of scFv, see Pluckthun (1994) THE PHARMACOLOGY OF MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, vol. 113, Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 269-315. See also, International Patent Application Publication No. WO 88/01649 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,946,778 and 5,260,203.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “domain antibody” is an immunologically functional immunoglobulin fragment containing only the variable region of a heavy chain or the variable region of a light chain. In some instances, two or more V\nH \nregions are covalently joined with a peptide linker to create a bivalent domain antibody. The two V\nH \nregions of a bivalent domain antibody may target the same or different antigens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “bivalent antibody” comprises two antigen-binding sites. In some instances, the two binding sites have the same antigen specificities. However, bivalent antibodies may be bispecific. For example, the present invention comprises scfv dimers and dsfv dimers, each of which scfv and dsfv moieties may have a common or different antigen binding specificity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment of the invention, a (dsfv)\n2 \ncomprises three peptide chains: two V\nH \nmoieties linked by a peptide linker and bound by disulfide bridges to two V\nL \nmoieties. In an embodiment of the invention, a bispecific ds diabody comprises a VH1-VL\n2 \n(tethered by a peptide linker) linked, by a disulfide bridge between the VH1 and VL\n1\n, to a VL\n1\n-VH2 moiety (also tethered by a peptide linker). In an embodiment of the invention, a bispecific dsfv-dsfv′ also comprises three peptide chains: a VH1-VH2 moiety wherein the heavy chains are linked by a peptide linker (e.g., a long flexible linker) and are bound to VL\n1 \nand VL\n2 \nmoieties, respectively, by disulfide bridges; wherein each disulfide paired heavy and light chain has a different antigen specificity. In an embodiment of the invention, an scfv dimer (a bivalent diabody) comprises a V\nH\n-V\nL \nmoiety wherein the heavy and light chains are bound to by a peptide linker and dimerized with another such moiety such that V\nH\ns of one chain coordinate with the V\nL\ns of another chain and form two identical binding sites. In an embodiment of the invention a bispecific diabody comprises VH1-VL\n2 \nmoiety (linked by a peptide linker) associated with a VL\n1\n-VH2 (linked by a peptide linker), wherein the VH1 and VL\n1 \ncoordinate and the VH2 and VL\n2 \ncoordinate and each coordinated set has diverse antigen specificities.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “monoclonal antibody”, as used herein, refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic epitope. In contrast, conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations typically include a multitude of antibodies directed against (or specific for) different epitopes. The modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made recombinantly or by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. (1975) \nNature \n256: 495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The “monoclonal antibodies” may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. (1991) \nNature \n352: 624-628 and Marks et al. (1991) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n222: 581-597, for example. See also Presta (2005) \nJ. Allergy Clin. Immunol. \n116:731.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMonoclonal antibodies include “chimeric” antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al., (1984) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n81: 6851-6855). For example, variable domains are obtained from an antibody from an experimental animal (the “parental antibody”), such as a human, and the constant domain sequences are obtained from canine antibodies, so that the resulting chimeric antibody will be less likely to elicit an adverse immune response in a canine subject than the parental human antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA recombinant antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention is, in an embodiment of the invention, an antibody which is produced recombinantly, e.g., expressed from a polynucleotide which has been introducted into an organism (e.g., a plasmid containing a polynucleotide encoding the antibody or fragment transformed into a bacterial cell (e.g., \nE. coli\n) or a mammalian cell (e.g., CHO cell)), followed by isolation of the antibody or fragment from the organism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment of the invention, anti-idiotypic antibodies or anti-idiotypes are antibodies directed against the antigen-combining region or variable region (called the idiotype) of another antibody molecule. As disclosed by Jerne (Jerne, N. K., (1974) Ann. Immunol. (Paris) 125c:373 and Jerne, N. K., et al., (1982) EMBO 1:234), immunization with an antibody molecule expressing a paratope (antigen-combining site) for a given antigen will produce a group of anti-antibodies, some of which share, with the antigen, a complementary structure to the paratope. Immunization with a subpopulation of the anti-idiotypic antibodies will, in turn, produce a subpopulation of antibodies or immune cell subsets that are reactive to the initial antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also includes camelized single domain antibodies. See, e.g., Muyldermans et al. (2001) \nTrends Biochem. Sci. \n26:230; Reichmann et al. (1999) \nJ. Immunol. Methods \n231:25; WO 94/04678; WO 94/25591; U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,079, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties). Camelidae (camels, dromedaries and llamas) comprise IgG antibodies in which are devoid of light chains and therefore called ‘heavy-chain’ IgGs or HCAb (for heavy-chain antibody). HCAbs typically have a molecular weight of ˜95 kDa since they consist only of the heavy-chain variable domains. Although the HCAbs are devoid of light chains, they have an authentic antigen-binding repertoire (Hamers-Casterman et al., Nature (1993) 363:446-448; Nguyen et al., Adv. Immunol. (2001) 79:261-296; Nguyen et al., Immunogenetics. (2002) 54:39-47). In one embodiment, the present invention provides single domain antibodies comprising two V\nH \ndomains with modifications such that single domain antibodies are formed.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “diabodies” refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen-binding sites, which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain (V\nH\n) connected to a light chain variable domain (V\nL\n) in the same polypeptide chain (V\nH\n-V\nL \nor V\nL\n-V\nH\n). By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain, the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen-binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in, e.g., EP 404,097; WO 93/11161; and Holliger et al. (1993) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n90: 6444-6448. For a review of engineered antibody variants generally see Holliger and Hudson (2005) \nNat. Biotechnol. \n23:1126-1136.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “humanized antibody” refers to forms of antibodies that contain sequences from both human and non-human (e.g., murine, rat) antibodies. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin, and all or substantially all of the framework (FR) regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody may optionally comprise at least a portion of a human immunoglobulin constant region (Fc).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the present invention comprises any humanized antibody comprising the CDRs of 9H2 or 2C6, e.g., wherein identical CDRs were originally isolated from a non-human species antibody and incorporated into a human antibody framework.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies of the present invention also include antibodies with modified (or blocked) Fc regions to provide altered effector functions. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,821; WO2003/086310; WO2005/120571; WO2006/0057702. Such modifications can be used to enhance or suppress various reactions of the immune system, with possible beneficial effects in diagnosis and therapy. Alterations of the Fc region include amino acid changes (substitutions, deletions and insertions), glycosylation or deglycosylation, and adding multiple Fc. Changes to the Fc can also alter the half-life of antibodies in therapeutic antibodies, enabling less frequent dosing and thus increased convenience and decreased use of material. See Presta (2005) \nJ. Allergy Clin. Immunol. \n116:731 at 734-35.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IGF1R antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof of the invention are, in an embodiment of the invention, conjugated to a chemical moiety. The chemical moiety may be, inter alia, a polymer, a radionuclide or a cytotoxic factor. In an embodiment of the invention, the chemical moiety is a polymer which increases the half-life of the antibody or fragment in the body of a subject to whom it is administered. Polymers include, but are not limited to, polyethylene glycol (PEG) (e.g., PEG with a molecular weight of 2 kDa, 5 kDa, 10 kDa, 12 kDa, 20 kDa, 30 kDa or 40 kDa), dextran and monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG). Lee, et al., (1999) (Bioconj. Chem. 10:973-981) discloses PEG conjugated single-chain antibodies. Wen, et al., (2001) (Bioconj. Chem. 12:545-553) disclose conjugating antibodies with PEG which is attached to a radiometal chelator (diethylenetriaminpentaacetic acid (DTPA)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of the invention are, in an embodiment of the invention, conjugated with labels such as \n99m\nTc, \n99\nTc, \n90\nY, \n11\nIn, \n32\nP, \n14\nC, \n125\nI, \n3\nH, \n131\nI, \n123\nI, \n11\nC, \n15\nO, \n13\nN, \n18\nF, \n35\nS, \n51\nCr, \n57\nTo, \n226\nRa, \n60\nCo, \n59\nFe, \n57\nSe, \n152\nEu, \n67\nCU, \n217\nCi, \n211\nAt, \n212\nPb, \n47\nSc, \n109\nPd, \n234\nTh, and \n40\nK, \n157\nGd, \n55\nMn, \n52\nTr and \n56\nFe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of the invention may also be conjugated with fluorescent or chemilluminescent labels, including fluorophores such as rare earth chelates, fluorescein and its derivatives, rhodamine and its derivatives, isothiocyanate, phycoerythrin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaladehyde, fluorescamine, \n152\nEu, dansyl, umbelliferone, luciferin, luminal label, isoluminal label, an aromatic acridinium ester label, an imidazole label, an acridimium salt label, an oxalate ester label, an aequorin label, 2,3-dihydrophthalazinediones, biotin, avidin, peroxidase such as horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase (e.g., calf, shrimp or bacterial), spin labels and stable free radicals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of the invention may also be conjugated to a cytotoxic factor such as diptheria toxin, \nPseudomonas aeruginosa \nexotoxin A chain, ricin A chain, abrin A chain, modeccin A chain, alpha-sarcin, \nAleurites fordii \nproteins and compounds (e.g., fatty acids), dianthin proteins, \nPhytoiacca americana \nproteins PAPI, PAPII, and PAP-S, \nmomordica charantia \ninhibitor, curcin, crotin, \nsaponaria officinalis \ninhibitor, mitogellin, restrictocin, phenomycin, and enomycin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny method known in the art for conjugating the antibodies and antigen-binding fragments of the invention to the various moieties may be employed, including those methods described by Hunter, et al., (1962) Nature 144:945; David, et al., (1974) Biochemistry 13:1014; Pain, et al., (1981) J. Immunol. Meth. 40:219; and Nygren, J., (1982) Histochem. and Cytochem. 30:407. Methods for conjugating antibodies are conventional and very well known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHybridomas expressing the 9H2 and 2C6 antibodies were deposited, under the Budapest Treaty, on May 10, 2007, with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC); 10801 University Boulevard; Manassas, Va. 20110-2209. All restrictions on the accessibility of the deposited plasmids to the public will be irrevocably removed by the applicant upon the granting of a patent from this application. The ATCC deposit number for the 9H2.E12 hybridoma (expressing the 9H2 antibody) is PTA-8428 and the ATCC deposit number for the 2C6.B10 hybridoma (expressing the 2C6 antibody) is PTA-8429. Each of the isolated hybridomas form part of the present invention along with any composition comprising such a hybridoma (e.g., a hybridoma and a cellular growth medium). Also part of the present invention is any antibody which is produced by such hybridomas, any antigen-binding fragment thereof, any antibody of fragment comprising one or more of the CDRs (e.g., 3 light chain and/or 3 heavy chain) of such antibodies or fragments or any composition thereof, e.g., comprising a further therapeutic agent (as discussed herein). The scope of the present invention also includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising any such antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention further comprises a method for generating an anti-IGF1R antibody of the present invention comprising culturing such a hybridoma under conditions suitable for expression of such an antibody and, optionally, isolation of such an antibody from the hybridoma. Any isolated antibody produced by such a process or any composition thereof forms part of the present invention. Any method of treating or preventing a medical disorder comprising an anti-IGF1R antibody, as discussed herein, comprising administering an antibody generated by a hybridoma with ATCC deposit number a PTA-8428 or PTA-8429 also forms part of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment of the invention, an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof binds “specifically” to an antigen, such as human IGF1R, if said binding exhibits a K\nD \nof about 10\n−9\nM.\n\n\n \nMolecular Biology\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with the present invention there may be employed conventional molecular biology, microbiology, and recombinant DNA techniques within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature.

(1994).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “polynucleotide”, “nucleic acid” or “nucleic acid molecule” includes the phosphate ester polymeric form of ribonucleosides (adenosine, guanosine, uridine or cytidine; “RNA molecules”) or deoxyribonucleosides (deoxyadenosine, deoxyguanosine, deoxythymidine, or deoxycytidine; “DNA molecules”), or any phosphoester analogs thereof, such as phosphorothioates and thioesters, in single stranded form, double-stranded form or otherwise.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “polynucleotide sequence”, “nucleic acid sequence” or “nucleotide sequence” is a series of nucleotide bases (also called “nucleotides”) in a nucleic acid, such as DNA or RNA, and means any chain of two or more nucleotides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “coding sequence” or a sequence “encoding” an expression product, such as a RNA, polypeptide, protein, or enzyme, is a nucleotide sequence that, when expressed, results in production of the product.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “gene” includes a DNA sequence that codes for or corresponds to a particular sequence of ribonucleotides or amino acids which comprise all or part of one or more RNA molecules, proteins or enzymes, and may or may not include regulatory DNA sequences, such as promoter sequences, which determine, for example, the conditions under which the gene is expressed. Genes may be transcribed from DNA to RNA which may or may not be translated into an amino acid sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Amplification” of DNA as used herein includes the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to increase the concentration of a particular DNA sequence within a mixture of DNA sequences. For a description of PCR see Saiki, et al., Science (1988) 239: 487. In a specific embodiment, the present invention includes a nucleic acid, which encodes anti-IGF1R antibody 2C6 or 9H2, anti-IGF1R antibody 2C6 or 9H2 heavy or light chain immunoglobulin, anti-IGFR1 antibody 2C6 or 9H2 heavy or light chain immunoglobulin variable region or an anti-IGFR1 antibody 2C6 or 9H2CDR (e.g., CDR-L1, CDR-L2, CDR-L3, CDR-H1, CDR-H2 or CDR-H3) which can be amplified by PCR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “oligonucleotide” includes a nucleic acid, generally of at least 10 (e.g., 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14), preferably at least 15 (e.g., 15, 16, 17, 18 or 19), and more preferably at least 20 nucleotides (e.g., 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or 30), preferably no more than 100 nucleotides (e.g., 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90), that may be hybridizable to a genomic DNA molecule, a cDNA molecule, or an mRNA molecule encoding a gene, mRNA, cDNA, or other nucleic acid of interest. Oligonucleotides can be labeled, e.g., by incorporation of \n32\nP-nucleotides, \n3\nH-nucleotides, \n14\nC-nucleotides, \n35\nS-nucleotides or nucleotides to which a label, such as biotin, has been covalently conjugated. In one embodiment, a labeled oligonucleotide can be used as a probe to detect the presence of a nucleic acid. In another embodiment, oligonucleotides (one or both of which may be labeled) can be used as PCR primers, either for cloning full length or a fragment of the gene, or to detect the presence of nucleic acids. Generally, oligonucleotides are prepared synthetically, e.g., on a nucleic acid synthesizer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe sequence of any nucleic acid may be sequenced by any method known in the art (e.g., chemical sequencing or enzymatic sequencing). “Chemical sequencing” of DNA includes methods such as that of Maxam and Gilbert (1977) (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74:560), in which DNA is randomly cleaved using individual base-specific reactions. “Enzymatic sequencing” of DNA may includes methods such as that of Sanger (Sanger, et al., (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74:5463).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nucleic acids herein may, in an embodiment of the invention, be flanked by natural regulatory (expression control) sequences, or may be associated with heterologous sequences, including promoters, internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) and other ribosome binding site sequences, enhancers, response elements, suppressors, signal sequences, polyadenylation sequences, introns, 5′- and 3′-non-coding regions, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “promoter” or “promoter sequence” is, in an embodiment of the invention, a DNA regulatory region capable of binding an RNA polymerase in a cell (e.g., directly or through other promoter-bound proteins or substances) and initiating transcription of a coding sequence. A promoter sequence is, in general, bounded at its 3′ terminus by the transcription initiation site and extends upstream (5′ direction) to include the minimum number of bases or elements necessary to initiate transcription at any level. Within the promoter sequence may be found a transcription initiation site (conveniently defined, for example, by mapping with nuclease S1), as well as protein binding domains (consensus sequences) responsible for the binding of RNA polymerase. The promoter may be operably associated with other expression control sequences, including enhancer and repressor sequences or with a nucleic acid of the invention. Promoters which may be used to control gene expression include, but are not limited to, cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,385,839 and 5,168,062), the SV40 early promoter region (Benoist, et al., (1981) Nature 290:304-310), the promoter contained in the 3′ long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (Yamamoto, et al., (1980) Cell 22:787-797), the herpes thymidine kinase promoter (Wagner, et al., (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:1441-1445), the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene (Brinster, et al., (1982) Nature 296:39-42); prokaryotic expression vectors such as the β-lactamase promoter (VIIIa-Komaroff, et al., (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 75:3727-3731), or the tac promoter (DeBoer, et al., (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:21-25); see also “Useful proteins from recombinant bacteria” in Scientific American (1980) 242:74-94; and promoter elements from yeast or other fungi such as the Gal 4 promoter, the ADC (alcohol dehydrogenase) promoter, PGK (phosphoglycerol kinase) promoter or the alkaline phosphatase promoter.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA coding sequence is “under the control of”, “functionally associated with” or “operably associated with” transcriptional or translational control sequences in a cell when the sequences direct RNA polymerase mediated transcription of the coding sequence into RNA, e.g., mRNA, which then may be trans-RNA spliced (if it contains introns) and, optionally, translated into a protein encoded by the coding sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “express” and “expression” include allowing or causing the information in a gene, RNA or DNA sequence to become manifest; for example, producing a protein by activating the cellular functions involved in transcription and translation of a corresponding gene. A DNA sequence is expressed in or by a cell to form an “expression product” such as an RNA (e.g., mRNA) or a protein (e.g., antibody 2C6 or 9H2 or an antigen-binding fragment thereof). The expression product itself may also be said to be “expressed” by the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “vector”, “cloning vector” and “expression vector” include a vehicle (e.g., a plasmid) by which a DNA or RNA sequence can be introduced into a host cell, so as to transform the host and, optionally, promote expression and/or replication of the introduced sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “transfection” or “transformation” includes the introduction of a nucleic acid into a cell. These terms include the introduction of a nucleic acid encoding an anti-IGF1R antibody or fragment thereof into a cell. The introduced gene or sequence may be called a “clone”. A host cell that receives the introduced DNA or RNA has been “transformed” and is a “transformant” or a “clone”. The DNA or RNA introduced to a host cell can come from any source, including cells of the same genus or species as the host cell, or cells of a different genus or species.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “host cell” includes any cell of any organism that is selected, modified, transfected, transformed, grown, or used or manipulated in any way, for the production of a substance by the cell, for example the expression or replication, by the cell, of a gene, a DNA or RNA sequence, a protein or an enzyme.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “expression system” includes a host cell and compatible vector which, under suitable conditions, can express a protein or nucleic acid which is carried by the vector and introduced to the host cell. Common expression systems include \nE. coli \nhost cells and plasmid vectors, insect host cells and Baculovirus vectors, and mammalian host cells and vectors. In a specific embodiment, IGF1R or an antibody and antigen-binding fragment of the invention may be expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). Other suitable cells include CHO (chinese hamster ovary) cells, HeLa cells and NIH 3T3 cells and NSO cells (non-Ig-producing murine myeloma cell line). Nucleic acids encoding an antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention, sIGFR1 or IGFR1 may be expressed at high levels in an \nE. coli\n/T7 expression system as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,952,496, 5,693,489 and 5,869,320 and in Davanloo, P., et al., (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81, 2035-2039; Studier, F. W., et al., (1986) J. Mol. Biol. 189: 113-130; Rosenberg, A. H., et al., (1987) Gene 56: 125-135; and Dunn, J. J., et al., (1988) Gene 68: 259 which are herein incorporated by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention contemplates any superficial or slight modification to the amino acid or nucleotide sequences which correspond to the 2C6 or 9H2 antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof of the invention. In particular, the present invention contemplates sequence conservative variants of the nucleic acids which encode the 2C6 or 9H2 antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof of the invention. “Sequence-conservative variants” of a polynucleotide sequence are those in which a change of one or more nucleotides in a given codon results in no alteration in the amino acid encoded at that position. Function-conservative variants of the antibodies of the invention are also contemplated by the present invention. “Function-conservative variants” are those in which one or more amino acid residues in a protein have been changed without altering the overall conformation and function of the polypeptide, including, but, by no means, limited to, replacement of an amino acid with one having similar properties. Amino acids with similar properties are well known in the art. For example, polar/hydrophilic amino acids which may be interchangeable include asparagine, glutamine, serine, cysteine, threonine, lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid; nonpolar/hydrophobic amino acids which may be interchangeable include glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and methionine; acidic amino acids which may be interchangeable include aspartic acid and glutamic acid and basic amino acids which may be interchangeable include histidine, lysine and arginine. Conservative substitutions of an amino acid sequence refer to those wherein an amino acid of one subtype (e.g., polar/hydrophilic) is replaced with another amino acid of the same subtype; and, in an embodiment of the invention, wherein the conservatively substituted polypeptide retains essentially the same level of biological activity (e.g., binding affinity of a substituted anti-IGF1R antibody for IGF1R).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes nucleic acids encoding antibodies 2C6 and 9H2 and antigen-binding fragments thereof as well as nucleic acids which hybridize thereto. In an embodiment of the invention, the nucleic acids hybridize under low stringency conditions, more preferably under moderate stringency conditions and most preferably under high stringency conditions and, in an embodiment of the invention, exhibit IGF1R binding activity. A nucleic acid molecule is “hybridizable” to another nucleic acid molecule, such as a cDNA, genomic DNA, or RNA, when a single stranded form of the nucleic acid molecule can anneal to the other nucleic acid molecule under the appropriate conditions of temperature and solution ionic strength (see Sambrook, et al., supra). The conditions of temperature and ionic strength determine the “stringency” of the hybridization. Typical low stringency hybridization conditions include, in an embodiment of the invention, 55° C., 5×SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.25% milk, and no formamide; or 30% formamide, 5×SSC, 0.5% SDS. Typical, moderate stringency hybridization conditions are similar to the low stringency conditions except the hybridization is carried out in 40% formamide, with 5× or 6×SSC. High stringency hybridization conditions are similar to low stringency conditions except the hybridization conditions are carried out in 50% formamide, 5× or 6×SSC and, optionally, at a higher temperature (e.g., 57° C., 59° C., 60° C., 62° C., 63° C., 65° C. or 68° C.). In general, SSC is 0.15M NaCl and 0.015M Na-citrate. Hybridization requires that the two nucleic acids contain complementary sequences, although, depending on the stringency of the hybridization, mismatches between bases are possible. The appropriate stringency for hybridizing nucleic acids depends on the length of the nucleic acids and the degree of complementation, variables well known in the art. The greater the degree of similarity or homology between two nucleotide sequences, the higher the stringency under which the nucleic acids may hybridize. For hybrids of greater than 100 nucleotides in length, equations for calculating the melting temperature have been derived (see Sambrook, et al., supra, 9.50-9.51). For hybridization with shorter nucleic acids, i.e., oligonucleotides, the position of mismatches becomes more important, and the length of the oligonucleotide determines its specificity (see Sambrook, et al., supra, 11.7-11.8). In an embodiment of the invention, a nucleic acid which hybridizes to a nucleic acid of the present invention exhibits one or more of the same activities and/or biochemical characteristics of an immunoglobulin chain of 9H2 or 2C6. For example, the nucleic acid exhibits an ability of bind to IGF1R or a fragment thereof, to inhibit IGF1R tyrosine kinase activity, to inhibit tumor cell growth (in vivo or in vitro), to inhibit anchorage indepent cell growth (in vivo or in vitro) or to inhibit binding between IGF1R or a fragment thereof and IGF-1 or IGF-2 to at least the same degree as 9H2 or 2C6 antibody or to a lesser degree (i.e., to any detectable degree).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included in the present invention are nucleic acids comprising nucleotide sequences and polypeptides comprising amino acid sequences which are at least about 70% identical, preferably at least about 80% identical, more preferably at least about 90% identical and most preferably at least about 95% identical (e.g., 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 100%) to the reference nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the present invention (i.e., as discussed herein) when the comparison is performed by a BLAST algorithm wherein the parameters of the algorithm are selected to give the largest match between the respective sequences over the entire length of the respective reference sequences. Polypeptides comprising amino acid sequences which are at least about 70% similar, preferably at least about 80% similar, more preferably at least about 90% similar and most preferably at least about 95% similar (e.g., 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 100%) to the reference amino acid sequences of the present invention when the comparison is performed with a BLAST algorithm wherein the parameters of the algorithm are selected to give the largest match between the respective sequences over the entire length of the respective reference sequences, are also included in the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides variants of 2C6 and 9H2 anti-IGF1R antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, which bind specifically to human IGF1R (e.g., with essentially the same affinity as that of 2C6 or 9H2), but which include one or more conservative substitutions in the framework immunoglobulin variable region (i.e., outside the immunoglobulin CDRs). The present invention also includes 2C6 and 9H2 antibody and fragment variants wherein the framework comprises 90% or more (e.g., 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%) identity or similarity to that of the native 2C6 or 9H2 or any antigen-binding fragment thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSequence identity refers to exact matches between the nucleotides or amino acids of two sequences which are being compared. Sequence similarity refers to both exact matches between the amino acids of two polypeptides which are being compared in addition to matches between nonidentical, biochemically related amino acids. Biochemically related amino acids which share similar properties and may be interchangeable are discussed above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following references regarding the BLAST algorithm are herein\n\n\n \n \n \n \nincorporated by reference: BLAST ALGORITHMS: Altschul, S.

The present invention includes both recombinant and non-recombinant methods of production, e.g., as discussed herein. Non-recombinant methods include immunization of animals and subsequent isolation of antibodies or splenocytes (e.g., followed by hybridoma production) from the immunized animal. For example, a recipient may be immunized with a linked or unlinked (e.g. naturally occurring) form of IGF1R, or a fragment thereof. Any suitable method of immunization can be used. Such methods can include adjuvants, other immunostimulants, repeated booster immunizations, and the use of one or more immunization routes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny form of the antigen can be used to generate the antibody that is sufficient to generate a biologically active antibody. Thus, the eliciting antigen may be a single epitope, multiple epitopes, or the entire protein alone or in combination with one or more immunogenicity enhancing agents known in the art. The eliciting antigen may be an isolated full-length protein, a cell surface protein (e.g., utilized by immunizing with cells transfected with at least a portion of the antigen), or a soluble protein (e.g., utilized by immunizing with only the extracellular domain portion of the protein). The antigen may be produced in a genetically modified cell. The DNA encoding the antigen may genomic or non-genomic (e.g., cDNA) and can encode at least a portion of the extracellular domain. As used herein, the term “portion” refers to the minimal number of amino acids or nucleic acids, as appropriate, to constitute an immunogenic epitope of the antigen of interest. Any genetic vectors suitable for transformation of the cells of interest may be employed, including but not limited to adenoviral vectors, plasmids, and non-viral vectors, such as cationic lipids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTechniques for generating an antibody of the invention include selection of libraries of antibodies in phage or similar vectors. See, e.g., Huse et al., \nScience \n246:1275-1281 (1989); and Ward et al., \nNature \n341:544-546 (1989).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment of the invention, human monoclonal antibodies directed against IGF1R are generated using transgenic mice carrying parts of the human immune system rather than the mouse system. These transgenic mice, which may be referred to, herein, as “HuMAb” mice, contain human immunoglobulin gene miniloci that encodes unrearranged human heavy (μ and γ) and κ light chain immunoglobulin sequences, together with targeted mutations that inactivate the endogenous μ and κ chain loci (Lonberg, N., et al., (1994) Nature 368(6474): 856-859). Accordingly, the mice exhibit reduced expression of mouse IgM or κ, and in response to immunization, the introduced human heavy and light chain transgenes undergo class switching and somatic mutation to generate high affinity human IgGκ monoclonal antibodies (Lonberg, N., et al., (1994), supra; reviewed in Lonberg, N. (1994) Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology 113:49-101; Lonberg, N., et al., (1995) Intern. Rev. Immunol. 13:65-93, and Harding, F., et al., (1995) Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 764:536-546). The preparation of HuMab mice is commonly known in the art and is described, for example, in Taylor, L., et al., (1992) Nucleic Acids Research 20:6287-6295; Chen, J., et al., (1993) International Immunology 5: 647-656; Tuaillon, et al., (1993) Proc.

The use of HuMAb mice is commercially available from Medarex, Inc. (Princeton, N.J.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo generate fully human, monoclonal antibodies to IGF1R, HuMab mice can be immunized with an antigenic IGF1R polypeptide, as described by Lonberg, N., et al., (1994) Nature 368(6474): 856-859; Fishwild, D., et al., (1996) Nature Biotechnology 14: 845-851 and WO 98/24884. In an embodiment of the invention, the mice will be 6-16 weeks of age upon the first immunization. For example, a purified preparation of IGF1R or sIGF1R can be used to immunize the HuMab mice intraperitoneally. The mice can also be immunized with whole HEK293 cells which are stably transformed or transfected with an IGF1R gene.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, HuMAb transgenic mice respond well when initially immunized intraperitoneally (i.p.) with antigen in complete Freund's adjuvant, followed by every other week IP immunizations (usually, up to a total of 6) with antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Mice can be immunized, first, with cells expressing IGF1R (e.g., stably transformed HEK293 cells), then with a soluble fragment of IGF1R and continually receive alternating immunizations with the two antigens. The immune response can be monitored over the course of the immunization protocol with plasma samples being obtained by retroorbital bleeds. The plasma can be screened for the presence of anti-IGF1R antibodies, for example by ELISA, and mice with sufficient titers of immunoglobulin can be used for fusions. Mice can be boosted intravenously with antigen 3 days before sacrifice and removal of the spleen. Several mice can be immunized for each antigen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHybridoma cells which produce the monoclonal, fully human anti-IGF1R antibodies may be produced by methods which are commonly known in the art. These methods include, but are not limited to, the hybridoma technique originally developed by Kohler, et al., (1975) (Nature 256:495-497), as well as the trioma technique (Hering, et al., (1988) Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 47:211-216 and Hagiwara, et al., (1993) Hum. Antibod. Hybridomas 4:15), the human B-cell hybridoma technique (Kozbor, et al., (1983) Immunology Today 4:72 and Cote, et al., (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A 80:2026-2030), and the EBV-hybridoma technique (Cole, et al., in \nMonoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy\n, Alan R. Liss, Inc., pp. 77-96, 1985). In an embodiment of the invention, mouse splenocytes are isolated and fused with PEG to a mouse myeloma cell line based upon standard protocols. The resulting hybridomas are then screened for the production of antigen-specific antibodies. For example, single cell suspensions of splenic lymphocytes from immunized mice may by fused to one-sixth the number of P3X63-Ag8.653 nonsecreting mouse myeloma cells (ATCC, CRL 1580) with 50% PEG. Cells are plated at approximately 2×10\n5 \ncells/mL in a flat bottom microtiter plate, followed by a two week incubation in selective medium containing 20% fetal Clone Serum, 18% “653” conditioned media, 5% origen (IGEN), 4 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 5 mM HEPES, 0.055 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 mg/ml gentamycin and 1×HAT (Sigma; the HAT is added 24 hours after the fusion). After two weeks, cells are cultured in medium in which the HAT is replaced with HT. Individual wells are then screened by ELISA for identification of human anti-IGF1R monoclonal IgG antibodies. Once extensive hybridoma growth occurs, medium can be observed usually after 10-14 days. The antibody secreting hybridomas may be replated, screened again, and if still positive for human IgG, anti-IGF1R monoclonal antibodies, can be subcloned at least twice by limiting dilution. The stable subclones may then be cultured in vitro to generate small amounts of antibody in tissue culture medium for characterization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn general, for recombinant production of an immunoglobulin chain, a nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning (amplification of the DNA) and/or for expression. DNA encoding the chain is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures (e.g., by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody). Many vectors are available. The vector components generally include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: a signal sequence, an origin of replication, one or more marker genes, an enhancer element, a promoter, and a transcription termination sequence.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRecombinant immunoglobulins may be produced, e.g., by the method of Cabilly U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; and Queen et al. (1989) \nProc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA \n86:10029-10033; or made in transgenic mice, see Mendez et al. (1997) \nNature Genetics \n15:146-156. A recombinant method may comprise preparing a DNA sequence encoding an immunoglobulin heavy or light chain having specificity for a particular antigen; inserting the sequence into a replicable expression vector operably linked to a suitable promoter compatible with a host cell (e.g., bacterial cell such as \nE. coli \nor a mammalian cell); transforming the host cell with the vector; culturing the host cell; and recovering the heavy or light chain from the host cell culture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the antibodies or fragments of the present invention are produced in yeast according to the methods described in published international patent application no. WO2005/040395. Briefly, vectors encoding the individual light or heavy chains of an antibody of interest are introduced into different yeast haploid cells, e.g. different mating types of the yeast \nPichia pastoris\n, which yeast haploid cells are optionally complementary auxotrophs. The transformed haploid yeast cells can then be mated or fused to give a diploid yeast cell capable of producing both the heavy and the light chains. The diploid strain is then able to secret the fully assembled and biologically active antibody. The relative expression levels of the two chains can be optimized, for example, by using vectors with different copy numbers, using transcriptional promoters of different strengths, or inducing expression from inducible promoters driving transcription of the genes encoding one or both chains.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment of the present invention, the respective heavy and light chains of a plurality of different anti-IGF1R antibodies (the “original” antibodies) are introduced into yeast haploid cells to create a library of haploid yeast strains of one mating type expressing a plurality of light chains, and a library of haploid yeast strains of a different mating type expressing a plurality of heavy chains. These libraries of haploid strains can be mated (or fused as spheroplasts) to produce a series of dipoid yeast cells expressing a combinatorial library of antibodies comprised of the various possible permutations of light and heavy chains. The combinatorial library of antibodies can then be screened to determine whether any of the antibodies has properties that are superior (e.g., higher affinity for IGF1R) to those of the original antibodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment of the invention, immunoglobulin chains of 2C6 and/or 9H2 are generated by any of the recombinant immunoglobulin production methods set forth in published U.S. patent application no. US2005/0176099 to D. Saha. Such methods and the plasmids set forth therein containing one or more light and/or heavy chain immunoglobulins of 2C6 or 9H2 form part of the present invention. For example, an embodiment of the invention comprises introduction of 2C6 or 9H2 light and heavy chain immunoglobulin into universal transfer vectors (pULLS or pUHLS) and transfer of the chains from the universal transfer vectors into an amplifiable vector, such as pXBLS (or a derivative thereof), followed by introduction of the amplifiable vector into a cell for expression and isolation.\n\n\n \nFurther Chemotherapeutics\n\n\n \n \n \nThe scope of the present invention comprises compositions comprising one or more anti-IGF1R antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof of the invention optionally in association with one or more further chemotherapeutic agents along with methods for treating any medical disorder or disease set forth herein by administration of such a composition. A further chemotherapeutic agent comprises any agent that elicits a beneficial physiological response in an individual to which it is administered; for example, wherein the agent alleviates or eliminates disease symptoms or causes within the subject to which it is administered. A further chemotherapeutic agent includes any anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agent. An anti-cancer therapeutic agent is any agent that, for example, alleviates or eliminates symptoms or causes of cancer in the subject to which it is administered.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes within its scope compositions comprising any anti-IGF1R antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof in association with a further chemotherapeutic agent set forth herein and pharmaceutical compositions thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment of the invention, the further chemotherapeutic agent is a FLT-3 inhibitor, a VEGFR inhibitor, an EGFR TK inhibitor, an aurora kinase inhibitor, a PIK-1 modulator, a Bcl-2 inhibitor, an HDAC inhibitor, a c-MET inhibitor, a PARP inhibitor, a Cdk inhibitor, an EGFR TK inhibitor, an IGFR-TK inhibitor, an anti-HGF antibody, a PI3 kinase inhibitors, an AKT inhibitor, a JAK/STAT inhibitor, a checkpoint-1 or 2 inhibitor, a focal adhesion kinase inhibitor, a Map kinase kinase (mek) inhibitor or a VEGF trap antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention includes embodiments comprising an anti-IGF1R antibody of the present invention, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof in association with another anti-IGF1R antibody or antigen-binding fragment including, e.g., 15H12/19D12 LCC, 15H12/19D12 LCD, 15H12/19D12 LCE, 15H12/19D12 LCF, 15H12/19D12 HCA or 15H12/19D12 HCB or any combination thereof (e.g., a full antibody comprising LCB and HCB; LCC and HCA; or LCF and HCA).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDotted, underscored type encodes the signal peptide.

The preferred polyethylene-glycol-interferon alpha-2b conjugate is PEG 12000-interferon alpha-2b. The phrases “12,000 molecular weight polyethylene glycol conjugated interferon alpha” and “PEG 12000-IFN alpha” as used herein include conjugates such as are prepared according to the methods of International Application No. WO 95/13090 and EP1039922 and containing urethane linkages between the interferon alpha-2a or -2b amino groups and polyethylene glycol having an average molecular weight of 12000. The pegylated inteferon alpha, PEG 12000-IFN-alpha-2b is available from Schering-Plough Research Institute, Kenilworth, N.J.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preferred PEG 12000-interferon alpha-2b can be prepared by attaching a PEG polymer to the histidine residue in the interferon alpha-2b molecule. A single PEG 12000 molecule can be conjugated to free amino groups on an IFN alpha-2b molecule via a urethane linkage. This conjugate is characterized by the molecular weight of PEG 12000 attached. The PEG 12000-IFN alpha-2b conjugate can be formulated as a lyophilized powder for injection.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPegylated interferon alfa-2b is sold as PEG-INTRON® by Schering Corporation (Kenilworth, N.J.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPegylated interferon-alfa-2a is sold as PEGASYS® by Hoffmann-La Roche (Nutley, N.J.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther interferon alpha conjugates can be prepared by coupling an interferon alpha to a water-soluble polymer. A non-limiting list of such polymers includes other polyalkylene oxide homopolymers such as polypropylene glycols, polyoxyethylenated polyols, copolymers thereof and block copolymers thereof. As an alternative to polyalkylene oxide-based polymers, effectively non-antigenic materials such as dextran, polyvinylpyrrolidones, polyacrylamides, polyvinyl alcohols, carbohydrate-based polymers and the like can be used. Such interferon alpha-polymer conjugates are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,766,106, U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,888, European Patent Application No. 0 236 987 or 0 593 868 or International Publication No. WO 95/13090. The preferred PEG12000-IFN alfa 2b can be prepared by attaching in a PEG polymer to a histidine residue in the interferon alfa-2b molecule.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions of pegylated interferon alpha suitable for parenteral administration can be formulated with a suitable buffer, e.g., Tris-HCl, acetate or phosphate such as dibasic sodium phosphate/monobasic sodium phosphate buffer, and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients (e.g., sucrose), carriers (e.g. human plasma albumin), toxicity agents (e.g., NaCl), preservatives (e.g., thimerosol, cresol or benzyl alcohol), and surfactants (e.g., tween or polysorbates) in sterile water for injection. The pegylated interferon alpha can be stored as lyophilized powder under refrigeration at 2°-8° C. The reconstituted aqueous solutions are stable when stored between 2° and 8° C. and used within 24 hours of reconstitution. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,492,537; 5,762,923 and 5,766,582. The reconstituted aqueous solutions may also be stored in prefilled, multi-dose syringes such as those useful for delivery of drugs such as insulin.

The term “therapeutically effective amount” or “therapeutically effective dosage” means that amount or dosage of an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention or composition thereof that will elicit a biological or medical response of a tissue, system, patient, subject or host that is being sought by the administrator (such as a researcher, doctor or veterinarian) which includes any measurable alleviation of the signs, symptoms and/or clinical indicia of a medical disorder, such as cancer (e.g., tumor growth and/or metastasis) including the prevention, slowing or halting of progression of the medical disorder to any degree whatsoever. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, a “therapeutically effective dosage” of any anti-IGF1R antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention (e.g., an anti-IGF1R antibody comprising mature 2C6 or 9H2 light chain and/or mature 2C6 or 9H2 heavy chain) is between about 0.3 and 20 mg/kg of body weight (e.g., about 0.3 mg/kg of body weight, about 0.6 mg/kg of body weight, about 0.9 mg/kg of body weight, about 1 mg/kg of body weight, about 2 mg/kg of body weight, about 3 mg/kg of body weight, about 4 mg/kg of body weight, about 5 mg/kg of body weight, about 6 mg/kg of body weight, about 7 mg/kg of body weight, about 8 mg/kg of body weight, about 9 mg/kg of body weight, about 10 mg/kg of body weight, about 11 mg/kg of body weight, about 12 mg/kg of body weight, about 13 mg/kg of body weight, about 14 mg/kg of body weight, about 15 mg/kg of body weight, about 16 mg/kg of body weight, about 17 mg/kg of body weight, about 18 mg/kg of body weight, about 19 mg/kg of body weight, about 20 mg/kg of body weight), about once per week to about once every 3 weeks (e.g., about once every 1 week or once every 2 weeks or once every 3 weeks). As mentioned above, the therapeutically effective dosage of a further therapeutic agent is, when possible, as set forth in the \nPhysicians' Desk Reference. \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nDosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single dose may be administered or several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies or the particular circumstances or requirements of the therapeutic situation. For example, dosage may be determined or adjusted, by a practitioner of ordinary skill in the art (e.g., physician or veterinarian) according to the patient's age, weight, height, past medical history, present medications and the potential for cross-reaction, allergies, sensitivities and adverse side-effects. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment of the invention or composition thereof at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. The effectiveness of a given dose or treatment regimen of an antibody or combination of the invention can be determined, for example, by determining whether a tumor being treated in the subject shrinks or ceases to grow. The size and progress of a tumor can be easily determined, for example, by X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or visually in a surgical procedure. In general, tumor size and proliferation can be measured by use of a thymidine PET scan (see e.g., Wells et al., Clin. Oncol. 8: 7-14 (1996)). Generally, the thymidine PET scan includes the injection of a radioactive tracer, such as [2-\n11\nC]-thymidine, followed by a PET scan of the patient's body (Vander Borght et al., Gastroenterology 101: 794-799, 1991; Vander Borght et al., J. Radiat. Appl. Instrum. Part A, 42: 103-104 (1991)). Other tracers that can be used include [\n18\nF]-FDG (18-fluorodeoxyglucose), [\n124\nI]IUdR (5-[124I]iodo-2′-deoxyuridine), [\n76\nBr]BrdUrd (Bromodeoxyuridine), [\n18\nF]FLT (3′-deoxy-3′ fluorothymidine) or [\n11\nC]FMAU (2′-fluoro-5-methyl-1-β-D-arabinofuranosyluracil).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, neuroblastoma progress can be monitored, by a physician, by a variety of methods, and the dosing regimen can be altered accordingly.

In an embodiment of the invention, a patient whose tumor exhibits any of the following characteristics is selected for treatment with an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention: IRS-1 phosphorylation on tyrosine 896; (ii) IRS-1 phosphorylation on tyrosine 612; (iii) IRS-1 phosphorylation on any tyrosine; (iv) IGF-II; and/or (v) IGF1R phosphorylation on any tyrosine. Such characteristics can be identified in an tumor cell by any of several methods commonly known in the art (e.g., ELISA or western blot) (See e.g., US2006/140960).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions comprising an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are also within the scope of the present invention (e.g., in a single composition or separately in a kit). The pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy; see, e.g., Gilman, et al., (eds.) (1990), \nThe Pharmacological Bases of Therapeutics, \n8th Ed., Pergamon Press; A. Gennaro (ed.), \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n18th Edition, (1990), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.; Avis, et al., (eds.)

The precise amount depends upon the selected therapy being given. Such amount can be empirically determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration by inhalation can be provided by using, e.g., an aerosol containing sorbitan trioleate or oleic acid, for example, together with trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane or any other biologically compatible propellant gas; it is also possible to use a system containing an IGF1R inhibitor, which is optionally in association with a further chemotherapeutic agent, by itself or associated with an excipient, in powder form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment of the invention, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, which is optionally in association with a further chemotherapeutic agent, is formulated into a solid dosage form for oral administration, in one embodiment, into a capsule or tablet. Tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain one or more of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder; a lubricant; a diluent; a glidant; a disintegrating agent; a coloring agent; a sweetening agent; a flavoring agent; a wetting agent; an emetic coating; and a film coating.

Briefly, an active agent (e.g., anti-IGF1R, which is optionally in association with a further chemotherapeutic agent) is dispersed in a solid inner matrix, e.g., polymethylmethacrylate, polybutylmethacrylate, plasticized or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, plasticized nylon, plasticized polyethyleneterephthalate, natural rubber, polyisoprene, polyisobutylene, polybutadiene, polyethylene, ethylene-vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethylsiloxanes, silicone carbonate copolymers, hydrophilic polymers such as hydrogels of esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid, collagen, cross-linked polyvinylalcohol and cross-linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate, that is surrounded by an outer polymeric membrane, e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene/propylene copolymers, ethylene/ethyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene/vinylacetate copolymers, silicone rubbers, polydimethyl siloxanes, neoprene rubber, chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, vinylchloride copolymers with vinyl acetate, vinylidene chloride, ethylene and propylene, ionomer polyethylene terephthalate, butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers, ethylene/vinyl alcohol copolymer, ethylene/vinyl acetate/vinyl alcohol terpolymer, and ethylene/vinyloxyethanol copolymer, that is insoluble in body fluids. The compound diffuses through the outer polymeric membrane in a release rate controlling step. The percentage of active compound contained in such parenteral compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof, as well as the activity of the antibody or antigen-binding fragment, which is optionally in association with a further chemotherapeutic agent, and the needs of the subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the agents set forth herein can be formulated into a sustained release formulation including liposomal formulations such as unilamellar vesicular (ULV) and multilamellar vesicular (MLV) liposomes and DepoFoam™ particles (Kim et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta (1983) 728(3):339-348; Kim, Methods Neurosci. (1994) 21: 118-131; Kim et al., Anesthesiology (1996) 85(2): 331-338; Katre et al., J. Pharm. Sci. (1998) 87(11): 1341-1346). A feature of the DepoFoam system is that, inside each DepoFoam particle, discontinuous internal aqueous chambers, bounded by a continuous, non-concentric network of lipid membranes render a higher aqueous volume-to-lipid ratio and much larger particle diameters compared with MLV.\n\n\n \nExperimental and Diagnostic Uses\n\n\n \n \n \nThe antibodies and fragments of the invention may be used as affinity purification agents. In this process, the antibodies or fragments are immobilized on a solid phase such a Sephadex resin or filter paper, using methods well known in the art. The immobilized antibody or fragment is contacted with a sample containing the IGF1R protein (or fragment thereof) to be purified, and thereafter the support is washed with a suitable solvent that will remove substantially all the material in the sample except the IGF1R protein, which is bound to the immobilized antibody or fragment. Finally, the support is washed with a solvent which elutes the bound IGF1R from the column (e.g., protein A). Such immobilized antibodies form part of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides antigens for generating secondary antibodies which are useful for example for performing Western blots and other immunoassays discussed herein. Specifically, the present invention includes polypeptides comprising the variable regions and/or CDR sequences of 2C6 or 9H2 which may be used to generate an anti-2C6 or anti-9H2 secondary antibody. Detectably labeled anti-2C6 or anti-9H2 secondary antibodies are within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnti-IGF1R antibodies or fragments thereof may also be useful in diagnostic assays for IGF1R protein, e.g., detecting its expression in specific cells, tissues, or serum. Such diagnostic methods may be useful in cancer diagnosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, embodiments of the invention include ELISA assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) incorporating the use of an anti-IGF1R antibody or fragment thereof of the invention. For example, in an embodiment of the invention, such a method comprises the following steps:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) coat a substrate (e.g., surface of a microtiter plate well, e.g., a plastic plate) with anti-IGF1R antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(b) apply a sample to be tested for the presence of IGF1R to the substrate;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(c) wash the plate, so that unbound material in the sample is removed;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(d) apply detectably labeled antibodies (e.g., enzyme-linked antibodies) which are also specific to the IGF1R antigen;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(e) wash the substrate, so that the unbound, labeled antibodies are removed;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(f) if the labeled antibodies are enzyme linked, apply a chemical which is converted by the enzyme into a fluorescent signal;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(g) detect the presence of the labeled antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an embodiment of the invention, the labeled antibody is labeled with peroxidase which react with ABTS (e.g., 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)) or 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine to produce a color change which is detectable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the labeled antibody is labeled with a detectable radioisotope (e.g., \n3\nH) which can be detected by scintillation counter in the presence of a scintillant.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn anti-IGF1R antibody of the invention may be used in a Western blot or immuno protein blot procedure. Such a procedure forms part of the present invention and includes e.g.,:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) contacting a membrane or other solid substrate to be tested for the presence of bound IGF1R or a fragment thereof with an anti-IGF1R antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention. Such a membrane may take the form of a nitrocellulose or vinly-based (e.g., polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)) membrane to which proteins to be tested for the presence of IGF1R in a non-denaturing PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) gel or SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecly sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) gel have been transferred (e.g., following electrophoretic separation in the gel). Before contact of membrane with the anti-IGF1R antibody or fragment, the membrane is optionally blocked, e.g., with non-fat dry milk or the like so as to bind non-specific protein binding sites on the membrane.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) washing the membrane one or more times to remove unbound anti-IGF1R antibody or fragment and other unbound substances;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(3) detecting the bound anti-IGF1R antibody or fragment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDetection of the bound antibody or fragment may be by binding the antibody or fragment with a secondary antibody (an anti-immunoglobulin antibody) which is detectably labeled and, then, detecting the presence of the secondary antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IGF1R antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof of the invention may also be used for immunohistochemistry. Such a method forms part of the present invention and comprises, e.g.,\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(1) contacting a cell to be tested for the presence of IGF1R with an anti-IGF1R antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention;\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) detecting the antibody or fragment on or in the cell.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf the antibody or fragment itself is detectably labeled, it can be dected directly. Alternatively, the antibody or fragment may be bound by a detectably labeled secondary antibody which is detected.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe anti-IGF1R antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof of the invention may also be used for in vivo tumor imaging. Such a method forms part of the present invention and may include injection of a radiolabeled anti-IGF1R antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the invention into the body of a patient to be tested for the presence of a tumor which expresses IGF1R followed by nuclear imaging of the body of the patient to detect the presence of the labeled antibody or fragment e.g., at loci comprising a high concentration of the antibody or fragment which are bound to the tumor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImaging techniques include SPECT imaging (single photon emission computed tomography) or PET imaging (positron emissioin tomography). Labels include e.g., iodine-123 (\n123\nI) and technetium-99m (\n99m\nTc), e.g., in conjunction with SPECT imaging or \n11\nC, \n13\nN, \n15\nO or \n18\nF, e.g., in conjunction with PET imaging or Indium-111 (See e.g., Gordon et al., (2005) International Rev. Neurobiol. 67:385-440).\n\n\n \nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention is intended to exemplify the present invention and not to be a limitation thereof.

The testing antibody (9H2 or 2C6) supernatants or purified antibody were added to the plates and incubated for 30 minutes. Cells were then stimulated with IGF-I (7.5 ng/well in 1000 ul) for 15 minutes. An IGF only control well and no-treatment control well were included. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Hepes, 1.0% Triton X-100, 2 mM Sodium Orthovanadate, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Complete (Roche)). Cell lysates (85 μL) were transferred from cell plate(s) wells to the prepared ELISA plate(s).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nELISA plate(s) (NUNC MAXI-SORP surface # 439-454) were prepared with 100 ng/well anti-IGF1R capture antibodies, 19D12, overnight at 4° C. Plates were washed 6× with 150 μL/well wash buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20). Following incubation of lysates, ELISA plate(s) were washed 4× with 100 uL/well wash buffer, and 20 ng/well detecting Ab 4G10 in 100 μL was added. Plate(s) were on a plate shaker at room temperature for 2 hours and then washed 4× with 100 ul/well wash buffer. 100 μL/well HRP conjugated straptavidin was added to ELISA plate(s). Plate(s) were placed on a plate shaker at room temperature for 30 minutes, and then washed 4× with 100 μL/well wash buffer. TMB substrate was added to ELISA plate(s), and the plates were placed on a plate shaker at room temperature for 5-15 minutes. Following TMB incubation, 50 μL/well 1N H2SO\n4 \nstop agent was added. Plates were read on plate reader (Molecular Devices or equivalent) at 450/650.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe data generated in these assays is set forth below in Table 2.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC50 values associated with anti-IGF1R antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9H2 and 2C6 as determined with KIRA assays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nKIRA IGF-I\n\n\nKIRA IGF-II\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\nIC50 (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9H2\n\n\n7.8\n\n\n2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2C6\n\n\n1.4\n\n\n1.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention includes antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, as described herein, which exhibit any of the IC50 values set forth in Table 2.\n\n\n \nExample 2\n\n\nAffinity Measurements of Antibodies 9H2 and 2C6 for IGF1R\n\n\n \n \n \nIn these assays, the affinity of the 9H2 and 2C6 antibodies for IGF1R were determined using BIACore and KineXa assays.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBIACore. Soluble IGF1R was coupled to CM5 sensor chip via amine group linkage using the Wizard control software. Immobilization levels of IGF1R were targeted at 300 Resonance Unit (RU). Recombinant human IL-5 receptor (hIL-5R) was used as reference surface for subtracting nonspecific binding and bulk refractive index. The immobilized surfaces were subsequently conditioned with several pulses of regeneration buffer (25 mM HCl+1M NaCl) prior to affinity measurement.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssociation rate constant (Ka) and dissociation rate constant (Kd) of the interactions of anti-IGF1R antibody to soluble IGF1R were measured on the BIACore 3000 system using Control Software version 3.1. Anti-IGF1R antibodies were two-fold serially diluted in the HBS-EP running buffer including a zero control of HBS-EP buffer only in the concentration series. The antibodies were randomly injected in duplicate over the immobilized IGF1R and IL-5R flow cell surfaces at a flow rate 30 μl/min for 3 min at which time the injection was terminated and the amount of bound antibody measured (association). Buffer was then passed over the surface for the next 60 minutes at the same flow rate (dissociation). Following the dissociation, regeneration buffer was used to remove remaining anti-IGF1R antibody from the immobilized IGF1R surface, and the regenerated surface was then used for the next cycle of binding. Binding interaction temperature was maintained at 25° C. using the instrument temperature control function. The samples were maintained at 4° C. on a cooled sample block for the duration of the assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinExA. NHS-PMMA beads, with an average diameter of 98 mm, were used in all experiments. Purified soluble IGF1R was covalently coupled to NHS-PMMA. One ml of coating solution containing 10 mg/ml sIGF1R in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, was added to the 200 mg of NHS-PMMA beads and rocked overnight at 4° C. After incubation, the NHS-PMMA beads were allowed to settle for 3 min. The coating solution was then discarded and the beads were rinsed twice with 1 ml of 1M Tris-buffer, pH 8.0. Unreacted coupling sites and non-specific protein binding sites on the NHS-PMMA beads were blocked with 1M Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10% BSA at room temperature for 2 hours. Beads were resuspended with 27 ml of PBS running buffer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNon-specific binding (NSB) from fluorescence labeled secondary antibody and 100% signal from anti-IGF1R antibody without the presence of antigen were tested prior to affinity measurements. Using information from the NSB (0% signal) and 100% signal measurements, antibody and antigen concentrations were chosen to produce experimental signals ranging from 100% free and 0% free signals for the antibody. To measure antibody affinity, a soluble receptor was serially diluted with a fixed concentration of antibody and equilibrated. The equilibrated antigen-antibody solution sets were performed at various concentrations of antibody to obtain accurate information on both active binding site concentration and affinity. The mixture of antibody and antigen was rocked continuously for 4 hours at room temperature. The equilibrated mixture was then analyzed using the KinExA 3000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody affinity for cell surface IGF1R was determined for IGF1R transfected-293 cells using multi-curve analysis. As with the soluble receptor, experiments performed with multiple antibody concentrations were used for affinity determination. IgG concentrations of 10 μM or 160 μM were chosen for the low and high antibody concentrations for the whole cell assay. To obtain complete experimental curves, spanning the 0% and 100% free antibody signal range, the cells were subjected to a two-fold serial dilution in 1% BSA-PBS buffer and incubated with both low and high concentrations of antibodies. Once equilibrium was reached, the cells and bound antibodies were pelleted at 400 g for 10 minutes. Supernatants containing free antibody were carefully transferred into new test tubes and analyzed using the KinExA 3000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntibody affinity for soluble IGF1R and cell surface IGF1R was determined using the KinExA 3000 (Sapidyne Instrument Inc., Boise, Id.). A uniform and reproducible bead pack coated with IGF1R was created in the flow cell, held in place by a retention screen, and samples drawn through the bead column. As the samples rapidly passed through the column a small amount of the free antibody in the mixture was captured. The remaining unbound antibody was washed away. Captured antibody was then labeled by flowing a Cy5-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H+L) or Cy5-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, F(ab)′\n2 \nfragment specific over the column, followed by washed with PBS at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min for 1 min. The signal (delta) used for calculations was the difference between the final signal or endpoint, 10 to 5 seconds from the end of each run, subtracted from the initial signal at the beginning baseline, 5 to 10 seconds into each run. All samples were run in duplicate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe affinity of antibody 9H2 for IGF1R, as measured with the KineXa assay, was 1.24×10\n−10 \nM. The affinity of antibody 2C6 for IGF1R, as measured with the BiaCore assay, was 2.01×10\n−9\nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention includes antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof comprising 9H2CDRs which exhibit a K\nD \nof about 1.24×10\n10 \nM or a lower number; and antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof comprising 2C6 CDRs which exhibit a K\nD \nof about 2.01×10\n−9\nM or a lower number.\n\n\n \nExample 3\n\n\nAntibody 9H2 Inhibits Anchorage Independent Cell Growth\n\n\n \n \n \nThree milliliters of 0.6% agarose in complete MEM medium were added to each well of 6 well tissue culture plates and allowed to solidify (bottom layer). One hundred microliters of antibody 9H2 or a blank, at various concentrations, was added to culture tubes. HT29 cells (human colon adenocarcinoma grade II cell line) were harvested. Aliquots of the cells (15,000 cells) were added to the culture tubes containing the antibody and incubated at room temperature for 10-15 minutes. Three milliliters of a 0.35% agarose/complete minimal essential media (MEM) layer (top layer) were added to the antibody/cell mixture and then plated onto the solidified bottom layer. The top layer was allowed to solidify. The plates were then incubated for three weeks. MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-Thiazolyl)-2,5-Diphenyl-2H-Tetrazolium Bromide) was added to the wells and incubated for 1-2 hours. The plates were scanned and the colonies counted and analyzed using a customized colony counter application program.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe 9H2 antibody was observed to inhibit 75% of HT29 cell growth. The results of these experiments demonstrated that an anti-IGF1R antibody can inhibit anchorage-independent growth of all three malignant cell lines tested.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention includes antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof, as described herein, which inhibit anchorage independent growth, e.g., of malignant cells such as e.g., HT29 cells, for example at a level of 75% or more inhibition.\n\n\n \nExample 4\n\n\nAntibodies 2C6 and 9H2 Inhibit Cellular Proliferation\n\n\n \n \n \nThe ability of anti-IGF1R antibodies 2C6 and 9H2 to inhibit cellular proliferation was demonstrated in this example.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCell Preparation. SK-N-AS (human neuroblastoma) and MCF7L (human breast adenocarcinoma) cells were cultured for several passages no greater than 80% confluency in T-75 TC treated filtered flasks. The cells were trypsinized, counted and resuspended at a concentration of 25000 cells/ml in 10% HI-FBS (heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) RPMI medium containing NEAA (non-essential amino acids), L-Glu, MEM Vitamins and PS. 100 ul of cell suspension (2500 cells) was added to each well of a BD Falcon 96 well black, clear bottom TC treated plate. The cells were allowed to attach overnight at 37° C. The 10% RPMI was replaced with 100 ul RPML containing 2% HI-FBS containing NEAA, L-Glu, MEM Vitamins and PS in the presence or absence of the 2C6 and 9H2 anti-IGF1R antibody. The antibody concentrations used were 100 nM and a series of 1/5 dilutions down to 0.00026 nM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolution Preparation. All assay reagents were prepared in RPMI containing 2% HI-FBS at 20× concentration and serial diluted for a total of 10 test concentrations per treatment. Every test point was prepared in triplicate on separate assay plates. Cell proliferation was measured on Day 4 (discussed below).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAssay. Cell proliferation was measured using the Promega Cell Titer-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega Corp.; Madison, Wis.). This assay provided a method for determining the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of ATP in the culture, which indicates the presence of metabolically active cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe assay reagents and assay plates were equilibrated to room temperature and prepared immediately before addition to the assay plates. One volume of CellTiter-Glo® assay reagent was added to the incubated cells in each well of the assay plate and shaken on an orbital platform. The assay reagent was shaken for at least ten minutes to allow for equilibration of the ATP reaction and to ensure total lysis of all cells in the assay plate. The reaction had a half-life of five hours but in no case was reading done later than 30 minutes after addition of reagent. Luminescence was detected on Wallac 420 Plate Reader with stacker.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe results from these experiments are shown below in Table 3. The units in the tables (proliferation index) are arbitrary and are proportional to the number of viable cells observed in the culture under each respective condition.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of cellular growth inhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin the presence of anti-IGF1R antibodies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPercentage cellular\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAnti-IGF1R antibody\n\n\ngrowth inhibition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2C6\n\n\n53 (of SK-N-AS cells)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2C6\n\n\n21 (of MCF7L cells)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9H2\n\n\n42 (of MCF7L cells)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention includes antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof comprising 9H2CDRs which inhibit malignant cell growth, e.g, MCF7L growth at a level of 42% or more inhibition; and antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof comprising 2C6 CDRs which inhibit malignant cell growth, e.g., SK-N-AS growth at a level of 53% or more inhibition, or e.g., MCF7L cell growth at 21% or more inhibition.\n\n\n \nExample 5\n\n\nAnti-IGF1R Antibodies 9H2 and 2C6 Inhibit Human Neuroblastoma Tumor Growth In Vivo\n\n\n \n \n \nIn this example, the ability of antibodies 9H2 and 2C6 to inhibit the growth of human neuroblastoma cells, in vivo, was demonstrated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAthymic nude mice were inoculated with SK-N-AS tumor cells in the right flank, subcutaneously, along with Matrigel (1:1 cells:gel). In these experiments, 5×10\n6 \ncells/mouse in a 1:1 mix with regular matrigel were inoculated subcutaneously. Tumor size was measured with calipers and the data was entered into the Labcat® program (Innovative Programming Associates, Inc.; Princeton, N.J.). Mice were grouped with an average body size of 100 mm\n3\n. In these experiments, mice were dosed twice per week, intraperitoneally (i.p.), with 0.1 mg of anti-IGF1R antibody 9H2 or 2C6 or with a control IgG1 antibody.

The plate was emptied and blocked in 1×PBS/0.05% Tween 20+5% chicken serum (100 ul/well) for one hour at room temperature. The plate was then emptied and washed 3× using 1×PBST.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTest antibodies were diluted in 1×PBST+5% ChS and added to wells (100 uL/well total) for one hour at RT (biotinylated 19D12 LCF/HCA (see U.S. Pat. No. 7,217,796) was diluted to 400 ng/mL and 50 uL was added to wells; competing Abs were diluted to a concentration 2× the desired final concentration and 50 uL of each dilution were added per well).

The blot was probed with anti-IGF1R antibody.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe blot demonstrated that the intensity of bands corresponding to IGF1R decreased as the concentration of antibody to which the cells were exposed increased.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the present invention includes antibodies and antigen-binding fragments thereof as described herein comprising 9H2 or 2C6 CDRs which down regulate IGF1R expression in malignant cells, e.g., in H322 cells.\n\n\n \nExample 8\n\n\nIdentification and Isolation of 9H2 and 2C6\n\n\n \n \n \nIn this example, the isolation and identification of the 9H2 and 2C6 antibodies and the generation of hybridomas which express the antibodies is described.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen. Mice were immunized with two forms of antigen in alternation: (1) live cells (IGF1R transfected HEK293 cells) and (2) purified protein (sIGF1R; a recombinant protein encompassing the α-subunit and the extracellular domain of IGF1R; amino acid residues Met 1-Asn 932) (Ullrich et al. (1986) EMBO J. 5:2503-2512).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTransgenic Mice. HuMab Mice (Medarex, Inc.; Princeton, N.J.) were housed in filter cages and were evaluated to be in good physical condition at the time of immunization, at the time of the bleeds and on the day fusions were produced. The mice were of the (CMD); (Hco7) 11952; (JKD); (KCo5) 9272 genotype. Immunization Procedure. Mice were immunized with two forms of the antigen in alternation: 1.0×10\n7 \nIGF1R transfected HEK293 cells in saline and sIGF1R (20-40 ug). CFA adjuvant and sIGF1R (20-40 μg) were injected on Days 15, 43, 112, 128 and 129. Antibody titers were measured on Days 37, 54, 103 and 126. Fusions were performed on Day 131.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHybridoma Preparation. The SP2/0-AG14 myeloma cell line (ATCC CRL 1581) was used for the fusions. High Glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS, antibiotic-antimycotic (100×), and 0.1% L-glutamine was used to culture myeloma cells. Additional media supplements were added to the hybridoma growth media which included: 5% Origen—Hybridoma Cloning Factor (Fischer Scientific; Suwanee, Ga.), 4.5×10\n−4 \nM sodium Pyruvate, HAT (1.0×10\n−4 \nM Hypoxanthine, 4.0×10\n−7 \nM Aminopterin, 1.6×10\n−5 \nM Thymidine), or HT (1.0×10\n−4 \nM Hypoxanthine, 1.6×10\n−5 \nM Thymidine); and characterized fetal bovine serum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe spleen from a mouse was normal in size and yielded viable cells. The splenocytes were fused according to standard procedures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScreening of hybridomas. An initial ELISA screen for human IgGκ antibodies was performed 7-10 days post-fusion according to the following procedure:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(1) Coated plate overnight with anti-hu-κ, I μg/mL or anti-hu-γ, 1 μg/mL in 1×PBS, 50 μL/well. Stored in refrigerator.\n \n(2) Emptied plate and blocked plate in 1×PBST (PBS with Tween)+5% chicken serum for 1 hour at room temperature (100 μL/well).\n \n(3) Emptied plate and washed manually with wash bottle (3×) or plate washer (3×) using 1×PBST.\n \n(4) Standards were used for testing production level of the clones. Made dilutions with unknowns (1:10 in first well and dilute 2 fold across plate). Hu-IgG standards start at 1000 ng/mL and dilute 2 fold across plate.\n \nLeft a few wells for blanks: 1×PBST+5% chicken serum which is used for dilutions, 100 μL/well. Incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Fusion screens and subclones were tested diluted 1:2 in blocking buffer.\n        \n \n5. Repeated wash step #3.\n \n6. Diluted secondary antibody HRP(horse radish peroxidase)-anti-hu IgG-Fc reagent 1:5000 or HRP-anti-hu-κ in 1×PBST+5% chicken serum, added 100 μL/well. Incubated 1 hour at room temperature.\n \n7. Repeated wash step#3. (2×)\n \n8. Developed plate using 10 ml citrate phosphate buffer pH4.0, 80 μL ABTS, 8 μL H\n2\n0\n2 \nper plate.\n \n9. Incubated 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature.

Stored in refrigerator. Five milliliters needed for coating plate.\n\n\n(2) Emptied plate and blocked plate in 1×PBST+5% chicken serum for 1 hour at room temperature (100 μL/well).\n\n\n(3) Emptied plate and washed manually with wash bottle (3×) or plate washer (3×) using 1×PBST.\n\n\n(4) Used blocking buffer as diluent. Test sera, beginning at 1:50 dilution in the top row of the plate and diluted 2 fold/row down the plate (7×). Incubated at room temperature 1 hour. For subclone screening, a 1:1 dilution of culture supernatant in blocking buffer was used as starting material.\n\n\n(5) Repeated wash step #3.\n\n\n(6) Diluted secondary HRP-anti-hu IgG-Fc specific and/or HRP-anti-hu-K reagent 1:2500-5000 in 1×PBST+5% chicken serum, added 100 μL/well. Incubated 1 hour at room temperature.\n\n\n(7) Repeat wash step#3. (2×)\n\n\n(8) Developed plate using 10 mL citrate-phosphate buffer pH4.0, 804 ABTS, 8 μL H\n2\n0\n2 \nper plate.\n\n\n(9) Incubated 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature. Read plate at OD\n415 nm-490 nm\n. Considered twice above background titer limit.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn these assays, hybridomas 9H2 and 2C6 produced a positive ELISA signal. These data demonstrated that the hybridomas produced antibodies which can bind to soluble IGF1R.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAntigen positive hybridomas were then transferred to 24 well plates, and eventually to tissue culture flasks. IGF1R specific hybridomas were subcloned by limiting dilution to assure monoclonality. Antigen positive hybridomas were preserved at several stages in the development process by freezing cells in Origen DMSO freeze medium (Fischer Scientific; Suwanee, Ga.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe isotypes of 9H2 and 2C6 were determined according to the following procedure:\n\n\n \n \n(1) Coated plate overnight in refrigerator at I μg/ml soluble IGF1R in 1×PBS, 504/well. Emptied plate.\n\n\n(2) Added 1×PBST+5% chicken serum for 1 hour at room temperature. (100 μL/well). Emptied plate.\n\n\n(3) Used blocking buffer as a diluent, added supernatant or purified material to be tested in 1 well per secondary antibody to be tested-504/well. Incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature. Emptied plate.\n\n\n(4) Emptied plate and washed manually with wash bottle (3×) or plate washer (3×) using 1×PBST.\n\n\n(5) Using blocking buffer as a diluent, added secondary antibodies:\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHRP-anti-hu-gamma;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHRP-anti-hu kappa;\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHRP-anti-human IgGl; or\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHRP-anti-human IgG3\n\n\n \n \n \n \ndiluted 1:1000.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncubated for 45 minutes at room temperature.

No. 60/991,913, filed Dec. 3, 2007.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to new dopamine D\n3 \nand D\n2 \nreceptor subtype preferring ligands of formula (I) and/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates and/or polymorphs thereof. The invention also relates to processes for preparing the same, to compositions containing the same and to their use in the treatment and/or prevention of conditions which requires modulation of dopamine receptors.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nCyclohexane derivatives that are useful as therapeutics for the treatment of pain are described in International Patent Publication No. WO 99/67206.\n\n\nCompounds containing a cyclohexane, pyrimidine and piperazine ring are described in European Patent No. EP 431,580 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,957,921. These compounds act as central nervous system agents and dopaminergic agents, respectively. These compounds, however, do not contain an alkyl-amino group in the 2-position of the pyrimidine ring. Dopamine D\n3 \nreceptor modulator compounds containing a pyrimidine and piperazine ring are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/259882. These compounds do not, however, contain a cyclohexane ring.\n\n\n2-Amino-6-chloro-4-(N-methylpiperazino)pyrimidines as inhibitors of spiroperidol binding are described in, e.g., \nJ. Med. Chem., \n25, 1459, (1982).\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nSurprisingly, it has been found that in contrast to the compounds described above, the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention have high or very high affinity for dopamine D\n3 \nreceptors, and moderate to high affinity for dopamine D\n2 \nreceptors always in such a combination that the D\n3 \naffinity is 5 to 50 fold higher than the D\n2 \naffinity. In addition, the compounds of the present invention show even higher selectivity over other receptors. For example, these compounds do not show affinity for alpha-1 adrenoceptors, i.e., their inhibitor constants (Ki) are higher or much higher than 1000 nM.\n\n\nThe dual (i.e. D\n3 \nand D\n2\n) receptor functional antagonism coupled in the above mentioned particular proportion is especially important as it allows the simultaneous manifestation of the beneficial modulation of both D\n3 \nand D\n2 \nreceptors, however, without the appearance of the known disadvantages of each individual receptor action.\n\n\nThe compounds of formula (I) will be referred to in this application as “D\n3\n/D\n2 \nligands”.\n\n\nThe present invention relates to new piperazine derivatives of formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n\n\nQ represents C\n1-4 \nalkyl, —NR\n3\nR\n4\n, phenyl, optionally substituted phenyl, 1-pyrrolidinyl, 1-piperidinyl, 4-R\n5\n-piperazin-1-yl or 4-morpholinyl group;\n\n\nR\n1 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl group;\n\n\nR\n2 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl group;\n\n\nR\n3 \nrepresents hydrogen, C\n1-4 \nalkyl group, phenyl or optionally substituted phenyl;\n\n\nR\n4 \nrepresents hydrogen, C\n1-4 \nalkyl group, phenyl or optionally substituted phenyl;\n\n\nR\n5 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl group;\n\n\nand/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates and/or polymorphs thereof, to processes for preparing the same, to pharmacological compositions containing the same and to their use in the treatment and/or prevention of pathological conditions which require the modulation of dopamine receptors, such as, but not limited to, psychoses (e.g. schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorders), drug (e.g. alcohol, cocaine, nicotine, opioids) abuse, cognitive impairment accompanying schizophrenia, mild-to-moderate cognitive deficits, dementia, psychotic states associated with dementia, eating disorders (e.g. bulimia nervosa, etc.), attention deficit disorders, hyperactivity disorders, psychotic depression, mania, bipolar disorder, paranoid and delusional disorders, dyskinetic disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic induced parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia), depression and depressive states, anxiety disorders, sexual dysfunctions (eg. erectile dysfunctions), sleep disorders, emesis, aggression, autism and pain.\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to compounds of formula (III):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n\n\nR\n1 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl group, and\n\n\nR\n2 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl group.\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn one aspect, the present invention relates to compounds of formula (I):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n\n\nQ represents C\n1-4 \nalkyl, —NR\n3\nR\n4\n, phenyl, optionally substituted phenyl, 1-pyrrolidinyl, 1-piperidinyl, 4-R\n5\n-piperazin-1-yl or 4-morpholinyl group;\n\n\nR\n1 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl group;\n\n\nR\n2 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl group;\n\n\nR\n3 \nrepresents hydrogen, C\n1-4 \nalkyl group, phenyl or optionally substituted phenyl;\n\n\nR\n4 \nrepresents hydrogen, C\n1-4 \nalkyl group, phenyl or optionally substituted phenyl;\n\n\nR\n5 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl group;\n\n\nand/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates and/or polymorphs thereof.\n\n\nThe term “optionally substituted phenyl” as used herein means a phenyl group which can be substituted in any position by one or more halogen, C\n1-4 \nalkyl, C\n1-4 \nalkoxy, trifluoromethyl and/or cyano group, or combinations thereof.\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to salts of compounds of formula (I) formed with acids.\n\n\nBoth organic and inorganic acids can be used for the formation of acid addition salts. Suitable inorganic acids include, but are not limited to, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid. Representatives of monovalent organic acids include, but are not limited to, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and different butyric acids, valeric acids and capric acids. Representatives of bivalent organic acids include, but are not limited to, oxalic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid and succinic acid. Other organic acids can also be used, such as hydroxy acids, for example, citric acid, tartaric acid, or aromatic carboxylic acids, for example, benzoic acid or salicylic acid, as well as aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, for example, methanesulfonic acid, naphtalenesulfonic acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid. A preferred group of acid addition salts are those in which the acid component itself is physiologically acceptable and does not have a therapeutic effect in the applied dose and/or it does not have unfavourable influence on the effect of the active ingredient. These acid addition salts are pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Acid addition salts which are not pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be advantageous in the purification and isolation of the desired compounds of formula (I), and are therefore also included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nSolvates and/or hydrates of compounds of formula (I), as well as solvates and/or hydrates of salts of compounds of formula (I) are also included within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\nOne of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that compounds of Formula I can exist in different tautomeric and geometrical isomeric forms. For example, the compounds of formula (I) exist in the form of cis and trans isomers with respect to the configuration of the cyclohexane ring. The compounds of present invention are preferably in the trans configuration. In addition, certain compounds of formula (I) can exist as stereoisomers and diastereomers. All of these compounds, including cis isomers, trans isomers, diastereomic mixtures, racemates, nonracemic mixtures of enantiomers, substantially pure, and pure enantiomers, are within the scope of the present invention. Substantially pure enantiomers contain no more than 5% w/w of the corresponding opposite enantiomer, preferably no more than 2%, most preferably no more than 1%.\n\n\nThe optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional processes, for example, by the formation of diastereoisomeric salts using an optically active acid or base or formation of covalent diastereomers. Examples of appropriate acids are tartaric, diacetyltartaric, dibenzoyltartaric, ditoluoyltartaric and camphorsulfonic acid. Mixtures of diastereoisomers can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical and/or chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. The optically active bases or acids are then liberated from the separated diastereomeric salts. A different process for separation of optical isomers involves the use of chiral chromatography (e.g., chiral HPLC columns), with or without conventional derivation, optimally chosen to maximize the separation of the enantiomers. Suitable chiral HPLC columns are manufactured by Diacel, e.g., Chiracel OD and Chiracel OJ among many others, all routinely selectable. Enzymatic separations, with or without derivitization, are also useful. The optically active compounds of formulas (I) can likewise be obtained by utilizing optically active starting materials in chiral synthesis processes under reaction conditions which do not cause racemization.\n\n\nOne of ordinary skill in the art will also recognize that some of the compounds of formula (I) can exist in different polymorphic forms. As known in the art, polymorphism is an ability of a compound to crystallize as more than one distinct crystalline or “polymorphic” species. A polymorph is a solid crystalline phase of a compound with at least two different arrangements or polymorphic forms of that compound molecule in the solid state. Polymorphic forms of any given compound are defined by the same chemical formula or composition and are as distinct in chemical structure as crystalline structures of two different chemical compounds.\n\n\nAs used herein in the present specification and claims a “compound of formula (I)” will be deemed to encompass both the free base and salts, e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable salts, thereof.\n\n\nIn certain embodiments, preferred compounds of the invention are those compounds of formula (I) wherein\n\n\nQ represents C\n1-4 \nalkyl, NR\n3\nR\n4 \nor 4-morpholinyl group,\n\n\nR\n1 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl group;\n\n\nR\n2 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl group;\n\n\nR\n3 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl group;\n\n\nR\n4 \nrepresents hydrogen or C\n1-4 \nalkyl group;\n\n\nand/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates and/or polymorphs thereof.\n\n\nIn a further embodiment, the

The compounds are expected to be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of disease states in which D\n3 \nand/or D\n2 \nreceptors are involved in the disease pathology and thus their modulation is required, or in which modulation of D\n3 \nand/or D\n2 \nreceptors exerts beneficial effect on the state and/or process of the disease.\n\n\nDysfunction of the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system is involved in the pathology of several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as schizophrenia, mania, bipolar disorders, drug abuse, dementia, cognitive dysfunctions, and Parkinson's disease. The effects of neurotransmitter dopamine is mediated via at least five distinct dopamine receptors belonging to D1- (i.e. D\n1 \nand D\n5\n) or D\n2\n- (i.e. D\n2\n, D\n3 \nand D\n4\n) families. D\n3 \nreceptors have been shown to have characteristic distribution in the mammalian brain. Namely, they were found in high densities in certain limbic structures such as nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and islands of Calleja. Therefore, preferential targeting of the D\n3 \nreceptors may be a promising approach for more selective modulation of certain dopaminergic functions and consequently offers successful therapeutic interventions in several abnormalities such as schizophrenia, emotional or cognitive dysfunctions (see, e.g., Sokoloff, P. et al.: Nature 1990, 347:146; Schwartz, J. C. et al.: Clin. Neuropharmacol. 1993, 16:295; Schwartz, J. C. et al.: Brain Res. Rev. 2000, 31:277; Levant, B.: Pharmacol, Rev. 1997, 49:231; Laszy, J. et al.: Psychopharmacol. 2005, 179:567), drug abuse (see, e.g., Pilla, C. et al.: Nature 199, 400:371; Heidbreder, C. A. et al.: Brain Res. Rev. 2005, 49:77), Parkinson's disease (see, e.g., Levant, B. et al.: CNS Drugs 1999, 12:391; Joyce, J. N.: Pharmacol. Therap. 2001, 90:231; Bézard, E. et al.: Nature Medicine 2003, 9:762) and pain (see, e.g., Levant, B. et al.: Neurosci. Lett. 2001, 303:9).\n\n\nThe dopamine D\n2 \nreceptors are widely distributed in the brain and are known to be involved in numerous physiological functions and pathological states. D\n2 \nantagonists are, for example, widely used as antipsychotics. However, it is also well known that massive antagonism of the D\n2 \nreceptors leads to unwanted side effects, such as extrapyramidal motor symptoms, psychomotor sedation, cognitive blunting and endocrine alterations. These side effects seriously restrict the therapeutic utilization of D\n2 \nantagonist compounds (see, e.g., Wong, A. H. C. et al.: Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2003, 27:269; Stahl, S. M. 2002, Essential Psychopharmacology. Neuroscientific Basis and Practical Applications. 2\nnd \nEd. Cambridge University Press).\n\n\nCardiovascular side effects (such as orthostatic hypotension associated with dizziness, tachycardia and sometimes syncope) of the first generation antipsychotics (e.g. chlorpromazine, thioridazine, chlorprothixene) and second generation antipsychotics (e.g. olanzapine, risperidone) are well documented (see, e.g., Pacher, P. and Kecskeméti, V.: Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004, 10:2463; Brunton, L., Lazo, J. and Parker, K. (eds) Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 11th Edition, Mc Graw Hill, 2005, p. 462; Stahl, S. M. 2002, Essential Psychopharmacology. Neuroscientific Basis and Practical Applications. 2\nnd \nEd. p. 409, Cambridge University Press, 2000; http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2006/Sep_Pls/RisperdalConsta_Pl.pdf; http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/safety/2006/Aug_Pls/Zyprexa_Pl.pdf). Side effects of this sort hamper or seriously limit the antipsychotic therapy especially in the initial period. All the above mentioned first and second generation antipsychotics show considerable (i.e. nanomolar) affinities to adrenergic alpha-1 receptors and it is a common view that the majority of their cardiovascular side effects are mainly related to their alpha-1 antagonist actions. Thus, the lack of adrenergic alpha-1 activity is a highly desirable feature of a potential antipsychotic compound.\n\n\nThe present invention provides novel compounds of formula (I) and/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates and/or polymorphs thereof which have high affinity for dopamine D\n3 \nreceptors (Ki values less than 3 nM) and, simultaneously, have high-to-moderate affinity for dopamine D\n2 \nreceptors (Ki values of 10 to 50 nM) always in a such combination that the D\n3 \naffinity is 5 to 50-times higher than the D\n2 \naffinity. In addition, compounds of formula (I) have no affinity to adrenergic alpha-1 receptors.\n\n\nIn a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating conditions which require preferential modulation of dopamine D\n3 \nand/or D\n2 \nreceptors, such as, but not limited to, psychoses (e.g. schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorders), cognitive impairment accompanying schizophrenia, mild-to-moderate cognitive deficits, dementia, psychotic states associated with dementia, psychotic depression, mania, bipolar disorder, paranoid and delusional disorders, dyskinetic disorders such as Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic induced parkinsonism, tardive dyskinesia, eating disorders (e.g. bulimia nervosa), attention deficit disorders, hyperactivity disorders, depression and depressive states, anxiety disorders, sexual dysfunctions (e.g. erectile dysfunctions), sleep disorders, emesis, aggression, autism, drug (e.g. alcohol, cocaine, nicotine, opioids) abuse and pain, which comprises administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula (I) and/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates and/or polymorphs thereof.\n\n\nThe invention also provides the use of a compound of formula (I) and/or geometric isomers and/or stereoisomers and/or diastereomers and/or salts and/or hydrates and/or solvates and/or polymorphs thereof in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of conditions which require modulation of dopamine receptors, especially dopamine D\n3 \nand/or D\n2 \nreceptors.\n\n\nA preferred use for D\n3\n/D\n2 \nligands according to the present invention is in the treatment of schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorders, cognitive impairment accompanying schizophrenia, mild-to-moderate cognitive deficits, dementia, psychotic states associated with dementia, psychotic depression, mania, bipolar disorder, paranoid and delusional disorders, dyskinetic disorders such as Parkinson's disease, neuroleptic induced parkinsonism, depression and depressive states, anxiety disorders, and drug abuse (e.g. cocaine abuse).\n\n\nThe particular combination of the two receptor-actions described above allows the simultaneous manifestation of the beneficial actions of D\n3 \nfunctional antagonism (e.g. cognitive enhancer effect, inhibition of extrapyramidal motor symptoms, inhibitory action on drug abuse) and that of the D\n2 \nfunctional antagonism (e.g. antipsychotic effect). Furthermore, the same combination surprisingly results in cancelling out the disadvantageous features of D\n2 \nantagonism (e.g. extrapyramidal symptoms, psychomotor sedation, cognitive disturbances).\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe present invention will now be further described by way of the following non-limiting examples.

D\n3 \nReceptor Binding\n\n\nBinding assays were carried out on rat recombinant D\n3 \nreceptors (Perkin-Elmer, Cat. No. 6110139) expressed in Sf9 cells using [\n3\nH]spiperone (0.44-1.49 nM) as ligand and haloperidol (10 μM) for determination of non-specific binding. The assay was performed according to the supplier's assay protocol (Cat. No.: 3110139).\n\n\n2. D\n2 \nReceptor Binding\n\n\nD\n2 \nreceptor binding was determined as described by Creese et al. (\nEur. J. Pharmacol., \n60:55-66, 1979) on rat brain striatal membrane preparation using [\n3\nH]spiperone (0.4-1.3 nM) as ligand. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μM (+) butaclamol.\n\n\n3. Alpha-1 Receptor Binding\n\n\nAlpha-1 receptor binding studies were performed according to the methods described by Greengrass and Bremner (\nEur. J. Pharmacol., \n55:323-326, 1979) on rat cortical membrane preparation using [\n3\nH]-prazosine (0.22-0.37 nM) as ligand. The non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM phentolamine.\n\n\n4. Amphetamine-Induced Hypermotility\n\n\nOne hour after the oral administration of doses of the test compound or vehicle, male Wistar rats were subcutaneously treated with d-amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg, sc.) and were individually placed in activity cages for one hour. Locomotor activity was measured in a four-channel activity monitor equipped with infrared photobeams Horizontal movement was determined as the number of beam interruptions. Mean±SE of horizontal activity data of each group was calculated. Percent inhibition of amphetamine-induced increase in locomotion was calculated for each dose of the tested compound. The ED-50 value was determined by linear regression fitted to the dose-response plot.\n\n\n5. Catalepsy Test\n\n\nThirty minutes after the oral treatment with the test compounds male Wistar rats weighing 200-220 g (n=10/group) were placed in extra-ordinary position: placing both forepaws of the rat on a 10 cm high podium. Animals were considered to be cataleptic if they did not correct their body posture within 30 sec. The frequency of cataleptic animals was determined at one, two, three, four and five hours after the treatment. Minimum effective (cataleptic) dose was defined as the dose causing catalepsy at least at two readings (i.e. either at two time points in the same animal or in two different animals at any of the time points).\n\n\n6. Scopolamine-Induced Learning Disturbance in the Water-Labyrinth\n\n\nThe learning process of rats was assessed in a 3-choice point water-labyrinth system. The number of directional turning errors was recorded in three daily trials for three experimental days. Male Wistar rats weighing 180-200 g (n=10 per groups) were treated orally with vehicle or the test compounds 1 hour before each daily session. Scopolamine (3 mg/kg ip.) as amnestic agent was injected 30 minutes prior to the first daily trial. Mean±SE of errors committed in all the trials was calculated in each group. Percent inhibition of scopolamine-induced increase in the number of errors was calculated for each dose of the tested compound.\n\n\nDopamine D\n3 \nand D\n2 \nand adrenergic alpha-1 receptor binding data of selected compounds of the present invention are listed in Table 1.

The former two are the result of massive blockade of D\n2 \nreceptors in the basal ganglia whereas the latter is the consequence of antagonism of alpha-1 receptors.\n\n\nAs can be seen from Table 1, the compounds of the present invention are very highly potent ligands at D\n3 \nreceptors (Ki values are less than 3 nM) and moderately potent ligands at dopamine D\n2 \nreceptors (Ki values between 5 and 50 nM) showing 5 to 50 fold selectivity for D\n3 \nover D\n2 \nreceptors. Coupling the very high D\n3 \naffinity to the moderate D\n2 \naffinity in this particular proportion allows the beneficial (e.g. antipsychotic) actions of a D\n2 \nantagonist to be preserved, while at the same time, impeding (by the D\n3 \neffects) the appearance of the disadvantageous consequences of massive D\n2 \nreceptor blockade, such as extrapyramidal symptoms or cognitive disturbances. It is therefore anticipated that no or greatly diminished adverse effects related to D\n2 \nreceptors will occur in the course of therapeutical application of compounds of the present invention. Furthermore, as well as favourably modulating the dopamine D\n2 \nreceptor-mediated functions, action of the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention on dopamine D\n3 \nreceptors will also result in additional therapeutically beneficial effects e.g. cognitive improvement, diminution of negative and depressive symptoms. In addition, the compounds have no affinity to adrenergic alpha-1 receptors (Ki values are higher than 1000 nM for each compound) and thus have extremely high D\n3\n/alpha-1 selectivity. From the lack of affinity of the compounds to adrenergic alpha-1 receptors the lack of cardiovascular side effects (e.g. orthostatic hypotension and associated symptoms such as dizziness, tachycardia) is anticipated.\n\n\nThe beneficial effects of the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention carrying the above described particular combination of D\n3 \nand D\n2 \nreceptor binding affinities were demonstrated in vivo, in methods used to measure antipsychotic effect (amphetamine hypermotility), cognitive enhancer activity (scopolamine-induced learning disturbance) and extrapyramidal side-effect (catalepsy test).

With regard to cataleptogenic (i.e. extrapyramidal side effect-inducing) potential, compounds of formula (I) of the present invention are highly superior to the reference drugs olanzapine and risperidone both in absolute (MED) and relative (TI) terms. Since olanzapine and risperidone show equal binding affinity to the D\n3 \nand D\n2 \ndopamine receptors (see Table 1) whereas compounds of formula (I) of the present invention preferably bind to the D\n3 \nreceptor (their D\n3 \naffinity is 5 to 50 fold higher than the D\n2 \naffinity) in such a way that they have high or very high affinity to dopamine D\n3 \nreceptors and moderate to high affinity to dopamine D\n2 \nreceptors, the results of Table 2 also demonstrate that such particular combination of D\n3 \nand D\n2 \naffinities indeed result in preservation of the beneficial antipsychotic action with simultaneous elimination of the disadvantageous extrapyramidal side-effect (catalepsy).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of compounds of formula (I) on scopolamine-induced\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlearning disturbance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDose\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\n(mg/kg)\n\n\n% inhibition\na\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.2\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.4\n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.8\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n0.025\n\n\n38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n0.05\n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n31\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlanzapine\n\n\n1\n\n\n−12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n−49\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisperidone\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n−15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nnegative values mean further impairment in learning performance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData in Table 3 show that compounds of formula (I) of the present invention do exert cognitive enhancing effect (as evidenced by the considerable inhibition of the learning disrupting effect of scopolamine) in contrast to olanzapine and risperidone which further impaired rather than improved the learning performance of scopolamine treated animals. These findings demonstrate the beneficial effect of the very high to high D\n3 \nreceptor affinity characteristic for the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention and also point to the importance of the particular 5 to 50-fold D\n3\n/D\n2 \nselectivity ratio possessed by these compounds. In the case of risperidone and olanzapine, compounds which showed equal affinity to the D\n3 \nand D\n2 \nreceptors, the deleterious effect of D\n2 \nantagonism on learning overcame the beneficial cognitive action of D\n3 \nantagonism while in case of compounds of formula (I) of the present invention the 5 to 50-fold higher D\n3 \nreceptor affinity cancelled out the disadvantageous effect (cognitive disturbance in this case) of D\n2 \nantagonism.\n\n\nWhile the invention has been depicted and described by reference to exemplary embodiments of the invention, such a reference does not imply a limitation on the invention, and no such limitation is to be inferred.
