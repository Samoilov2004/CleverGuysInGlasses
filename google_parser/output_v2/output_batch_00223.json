Description\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n \n \n \nPeptide-based drugs are highly effective medicines with relatively short duration of action and variable therapeutic index. The present disclosure is directed to peptide-based prodrugs wherein the prodrug derivative is designed to delay onset of action and extend the half life of the drug. The delayed onset of action is advantageous in that it allows systemic distribution of the prodrug prior to its activation. Accordingly, the administration of prodrugs eliminates complications caused by peak activities upon administration and increases the therapeutic index of the parent drug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReceptor recognition and subsequent processing of the peptide and protein agonists is the primary route of degradation of many peptide and protein-based drugs. Thus binding of the peptide drug to its receptor will result in biological stimulation, but will also initiate the subsequent deactivation of the peptide/protein induced pharmacology through the enzymatic degradation of the peptide or protein. In accordance with the present disclosure, prodrugs can be prepared to extend the peptide or protein's biological half life based on a strategy of inhibiting recognition of the prodrug by the corresponding receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prodrugs disclosed herein will ultimately be chemically converted to structures that can be recognized by the receptor, wherein the speed of this chemical conversion will determine the time of onset and duration of in vivo biological action. The molecular design disclosed in this application relies upon an intramolecular chemical reaction that is not dependent upon additional chemical additives, or enzymes. The prodrug chemistry is broadly applicable to peptide and protein based drugs where an aliphatic hydroxyl group can be accommodated in the active site and when the chemically modified derivative yields a poorly active peptide or protein. A specific example to illustrate this point would be the formation of reversible serine esters, at the active site serine, in the family of serine proteases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInsulin is a miraculous peptide hormone. It demonstrates unparalleled ability to lower glucose in virtually all forms of diabetes. Unfortunately, its pharmacology is not glucose sensitive and as such it is capable of excessive action that can lead to life-threatening hypoglycemia. Inconsistent pharmacology is a hallmark of insulin therapy such that it is extremely difficult to normalize blood glucose without occurrence of hypoglycemia. Furthermore, native insulin is of short duration of action and requires modification to render it suitable for use in control of basal glucose. Established approaches to delay the onset of insulin action include reduction in solubility, and albumin binding. Prodrug chemistry offers the opportunity to precisely control the onset and duration of insulin action after clearance from the site of administration and equilibration in the plasma at a highly defined concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rich history of studies detailing the insulin structure-function relationship directs the amino acid locations where prodrug chemistry can be successfully employed. Insulin is a two chain heterodimer that is biosynthetically derived from a low potency single chain proinsulin precursor through enzymatic processing. Human insulin is comprised of two peptide chains (an “A chain” (SEQ ID NO: 613) and “B chain” (SEQ ID NO: 614)) bound together by disulfide bonds and having a total of 51 amino acids. The C-terminal region of the B-chain and two terminal ends of the A-chain associate in three-dimensional structure to assembly a site for high affinity binding to the insulin receptor. The selective insertion of hydroxyl groups can be accommodated without loss in potency at multiple locations within this active site region. Chemical esterification of these active site hydroxyl groups with specific dipeptides would dramatically lessen activity and serve as suitable prodrugs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPre-proglucagon is a 158 amino acid precursor polypeptide that is processed in different tissues to form a number of different proglucagon-derived peptides, including glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) and oxyntomodulin (OXM), that are involved in a wide variety of physiological functions, including glucose homeostasis, insulin secretion, gastric emptying, and intestinal growth, as well as the regulation of food intake. Glucagon is a 29-amino acid peptide (SEQ ID NO: 612 that corresponds to \namino acids\n 33 through 61 of pre-proglucagon, while GLP-1 is produced as a 37-amino acid peptide that corresponds to amino acids 72 through 108 of pre-proglucagon. GLP-1(7-36) amide (SEQ ID NO: 602; the C terminus is an arginine amide) or GLP-1(7-37) acid (SEQ ID NO: 601; C terminus is a glycine) are biologically potent forms of GLP-1, that demonstrate essentially equivalent activity at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon is a life-saving medicine that is used in the acute treatment of severe hypoglycemia. Oxyntomodulin has been reported to have pharmacological ability to suppress appetite and lower body weight. Clinical studies with GLP-1 like agonists have proven this family of peptides to be an effective treatment for Type II diabetes. In addition, it might be intrinsically safer than insulin therapy because of its glucose dependent action, thus eliminating the chances of hypoglycemia. Structure-activity relationship studies have shown that the N terminal histidine for each of these three peptides (glucagon, GLP-1 and oxyntomodulin) is especially important for the full action and that N-terminally extended forms severely diminish biological potency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOne disadvantage associated with the therapeutic use of these three peptides is their extremely short half-life (approximately two minutes) in plasma. Accordingly, to obtain reasonable glycemic control, native glucagon related analog peptides would need to be administered continuously for a prolonged period of time. The short half life results from the rapid degradation by Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV (DPP-IV), which cleaves between the second and third amino acids. This cleavage not only inactivates the native peptides but in the case of glucagon and GLP-1 the shortened forms are functional antagonists at their respective receptors. Accordingly, there is a need for longer-acting variants of glucagon, GLP-1, and oxyntomodulin, and related peptides, to realize the full therapeutic potential of these mechanisms of drug action.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY\n\n\n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment a prodrug derivative of a bioactive polypeptide is prepared by covalently linking a dipeptide to the bioactive polypeptide via an ester linkage.

For example, an amino acid chain comprising an amide group in place of the terminal carboxylic acid is intended to be encompassed by an amino acid sequence designating the standard amino acids. As used herein the term “O-amino acid” or “HO-amino acid” designates an amino acid wherein the native amino group at the N-terminus of an amino acid or an amino acid sequence has been replaced with an oxygen or hydroxyl group, respectively. For example, “O-HAEG” or “HO-HAEG” is intended to designate an amino acid sequence (HAEG) wherein the native amino group at the N-terminus has been replaced with an oxygen or hydroxyl group, respectively. The term “hydroxyl acid” or “hydroxyl acid” as used herein refers to an amino acid wherein the native alpha amino group has been replaced with a hydroxyl group. Similarly, the designation “-amino acid-amide” represents an amino acid sequence, wherein the native carboxy group has been replaced with an amide group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDesignation of an amino acid without specifying its stereochemistry is intended to encompass either the L or D form of the amino acid or a racemic mixture.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes any of the standard pharmaceutical carriers, such as a phosphate buffered saline solution, water, emulsions such as an oil/water or water/oil emulsion, and various types of wetting agents. The term also encompasses any of the agents approved by a regulatory agency of the US Federal government or listed in the US Pharmacopeia for use in animals, including humans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to salts of compounds that retain the biological activity of the parent compound, and which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. Many of the compounds disclosed herein are capable of forming acid and/or base salts by virtue of the presence of amino and/or carboxyl groups or groups similar thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be prepared from inorganic and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases, include by way of example only, sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium and magnesium salts. Salts derived from organic bases include, but are not limited to, salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared from inorganic and organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic acids include hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Salts derived from organic acids include acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluene-sulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “treating” includes prophylaxis of the specific disorder or condition, or alleviation of the symptoms associated with a specific disorder or condition and/or preventing or eliminating said symptoms. For example, as used herein the term “treating diabetes” will refer in general to maintaining glucose blood levels near normal levels and may include increasing or decreasing blood glucose levels depending on a given situation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an “effective” amount or a “therapeutically effective amount” of a prodrug refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the prodrug to provide the desired effect. For example one desired effect would be the prevention or treatment of hyperglycemia. The amount that is “effective” will vary from subject to subject, depending on the age and general condition of the individual, mode of administration, and the like. Thus, it is not always possible to specify an exact “effective amount.” However, an appropriate “effective” amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term, “parenteral” means not through the alimentary canal but by some other route such as subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraspinal, or intravenous.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “glucagon superfamily peptide” refers to a group of peptides related in structure in their N-terminal and C-terminal regions (see, for example, Sherwood et al., \nEndocrine Reviews \n21: 619-670 (2000)). Members of this group include all glucagon related analog peptides, as well as Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone (GHRH; SEQ ID NO: 657), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; SEQ ID NO: 658), Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 27 (PACAP-27; SEQ ID NO: 659), peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI), peptide histidine methionine (PHM) (SEQ ID NO: 660), and Secretin (SEQ ID NO: 661), and analogs, derivatives or conjugates thereof with up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 amino acid modifications relative to the native peptide. Glucagon superfamily peptides preferably retain the ability to interact with its corresponding receptor. For example, glucagon and glucagon analogs, derivatives, and conjugates thereof preferably retain the ability to interact with the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise stated, any reference to an amino acid position in a glucagon superfamily peptide (e.g. for linkage of a prodrug moiety, a conjugate moiety, a hydrophilic polymer, acylation or alkylation, amino acid modification, etc.) refers to the position relative to the native glucagon amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 612), see \nFIG. 18\n for an alignment of representative glucagon superfamily peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “glucagon related analog peptide” refers to those peptides which have biological activity (as agonists or antagonists) at any one or more of the glucagon, GLP-1, GLP-2, and GIP receptors and comprise an amino acid sequence that shares at least 40% sequence identity (e.g., 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%) with at least one of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 612), native oxyntomodulin (SEQ ID NO: 665), native exendin-4 (SEQ ID NO: 662), native GLP-1 (SEQ ID NOs: 601 and 602), native GLP-2 (SEQ ID NO: 663), or native GIP (SEQ ID NO: 664). Unless otherwise stated, any reference to an amino acid position in a glucagon related analog peptide (e.g. for linkage of a prodrug moiety, a conjugate moiety, a hydrophilic polymer, acylation or alkylation, amino acid modification, etc.) refers to the position relative to the native glucagon amino acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 612).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “identity” as used herein relates to the similarity between two or more sequences. Identity is measured by dividing the number of identical residues by the total number of residues and multiplying the product by 100 to achieve a percentage. Thus, two copies of exactly the same sequence have 100% identity, whereas two sequences that have amino acid deletions, additions, or substitutions relative to one another have a lower degree of identity. Those skilled in the art will recognize that several computer programs, such as those that employ algorithms such as BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, Altschul et al. (1993) \nJ. Mol. Biol. \n215:403-410) are available for determining sequence identity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “GLP-1 agonist” refers to a compound that stimulates GLP-1 receptor activity, as measured by cAMP production using a validated in vitro model assay, such as that described in Example 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “native GLP-1” is a generic term that designates GLP-1(7-36)amide (consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 602), GLP-1(7-37)acid (consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 601) or a mixture of those two compounds.

Commercial sources of atypical amino acids include Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis.), ChemPep Inc. (Miami, Fla.), and Genzyme Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, Mass.). Atypical amino acids may be purchased from commercial suppliers, synthesized de novo, or chemically modified or derivatized from naturally occurring amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein an amino acid “substitution” refers to the replacement of one amino acid residue by a different amino acid residue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term “conservative amino acid substitution” is defined herein as exchanges within one of the following five groups:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nI. Small aliphatic, nonpolar or slightly polar residues:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nAla, Ser, Thr, Pro, Gly;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nII.

Large, aromatic residues:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPhe, Tyr, Trp, acetyl phenylalanine\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nAs used herein the general term “polyethylene glycol chain” or “PEG chain”, refers to mixtures of condensation polymers of ethylene oxide and water, in a branched or straight chain, represented by the general formula H(OCH\n2\nCH\n2\n)\nn\nOH, wherein n is at least 9. Absent any further characterization, the term is intended to include polymers of ethylene glycol with an average total molecular weight selected from the range of 500 to 80,000 Daltons. “Polyethylene glycol chain” or “PEG chain” is used in combination with a numeric suffix to indicate the approximate average molecular weight thereof. For example, PEG-5,000 refers to polyethylene glycol chain having a total molecular weight average of about 5,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein the term “pegylated” and like terms refers to a compound that has been modified from its native state by linking a polyethylene glycol chain to the compound. A “pegylated polypeptide” is a polypeptide that has a PEG chain covalently bound to the polypeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein a “linker” is a bond, molecule or group of molecules that binds two separate entities to one another.

More particularly, the prodrugs disclosed herein are formulated to enhance the half life of the parent bioactive peptide or protein, while allowing for activation of the prodrug via a non-enzymatic degradation mechanism. The ideal prodrug should be soluble in water at physiological conditions (for example, a pH of 7.2 and 37° C.), and it should be stable in the powder form for long term storage. It should also be immunologically silent and exhibit a low activity relative to the parent drug. Typically the prodrug will exhibit no more than 10% of the activity of the parent drug, in one embodiment the prodrug exhibits less than 10%, less than 5%, about 1%, or less than 1% activity relative to the parent drug. Furthermore, the prodrug, when injected in the body, should be quantitatively converted to the active drug within a defined period of time. As disclosed herein, applicants have provided a general technique for producing prodrugs of known bioactive polypeptides that meets each of these objectives.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore particularly, a chemoreversible prodrug is provided comprising the sequence of a known bioactive polypeptide modified to have a dipeptide covalently bound to the bioactive polypeptide via an ester linkage. In one embodiment a prodrug is provided having a non-enzymatic activation half time (t1/2) of between 1-100 hrs under physiological conditions. Physiological conditions as disclosed herein are intended to include a temperature of about 35 to 40° C. and a pH of about 7.0 to about 7.4 and more typically include a pH of 7.2 to 7.4 and a temperature of 36 to 38° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdvantageously, the rate of cleavage, and thus activation of the prodrug, depends on the structure and stereochemistry of the dipeptide pro-moiety and also on the strength of the nucleophile. The prodrugs disclosed herein will ultimately be chemically converted to structures that can be recognized by the native receptor of the drug, wherein the speed of this chemical conversion will determine the time of onset and duration of in vivo biological action. The molecular design disclosed in this application relies upon an intramolecular chemical reaction that is not dependent upon additional chemical additives, or enzymes. The speed of conversion is controlled by the chemical nature of the dipeptide substituent and its cleavage under physiological conditions. Since physiological pH and temperature are tightly regulated within a highly defined range, the speed of conversion from prodrug to drug will exhibit high intra and interpatient reproducibility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs disclosed herein prodrugs are provided wherein the bioactive polypeptides have extended half lives of at least 1 hour, and more typically greater than 20 hours but less than 100 hours, and are converted to the active form at physiological conditions through a non-enzymatic reaction driven by inherent chemical instability. In one embodiment the a non-enzymatic activation t1/2 time of the prodrug is between 1-100 hrs, and more typically between 12 and 72 hours, and in one embodiment the t1/2 is between 24-48 hrs as measured by incubating the prodrug in a phosphate buffer solution (e.g., PBS) at 37° C. and pH of 7.2. The half lives of the various prodrugs are calculated by using the formula t\n1/2\n=0.693/k, where ‘K’ is the first order rate constant for the degradation of the prodrug. In one embodiment, activation of the prodrug occurs after cleavage of an ester bond linked dipeptide, and formation of a diketopiperazine or diketomorpholine, and the active bioactive polypeptide (see \nFIGS. 5A & 5B\n). Specific dipeptides composed of natural or synthetic amino acids have been identified that facilitate intramolecular decomposition under physiological conditions to release bioactive peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prodrug chemistry is broadly applicable to peptide and protein based drugs where an aliphatic hydroxyl group can be accommodated in the active site, and when the chemically modified derivative yields a poorly active (e.g., having 10% or less activity relative to the parent) peptide or protein. A specific example to illustrate this point would be the formation of reversible serine esters, at the active site serine, in the family of serine proteases. Medicinally important peptides and proteins where this prodrug technology can be employed, include but are not limited to insulin, glucagon and glucagon related peptides (GLPs, oxyntomodulin), gastrin inhibitory peptide (GIP), growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH), calcitonin, parathyroid hormone (PTH), neuropeptide Y (NPY), pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and related substances. Medicinally important proteins where this prodrug technology can be employed include but are not limited to growth hormone, erythropoietin (EPO), neutrophil stimulating growth factors (CGSF), interferons, blood coagulation enzymes, antibodies, leptin and the like.

Hydrophilic moieties can be attached to the glucagon related analog peptide under any suitable conditions used to react a protein with an activated polymer molecule. Any means known in the art can be used, including via acylation, reductive alkylation, Michael addition, thiol alkylation or other chemoselective conjugation/ligation methods through a reactive group on the PEG moiety (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group) to a reactive group on the target compound (e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group). Activating groups which can be used to link the water soluble polymer to one or more proteins include without limitation sulfone, maleimide, sulfhydryl, thiol, triflate, tresylate, azidirine, oxirane and 5-pyridyl. If attached to the peptide by reductive alkylation, the polymer selected should have a single reactive aldehyde so that the degree of polymerization is controlled.

Dextrans are polysaccharide polymers of glucose subunits, predominantly linked by α1-6 linkages. Dextran is available in many molecular weight ranges, e.g., about 1 kD to about 100 kD, or from about 5, 10, 15 or 20 kD to about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90 kD.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain or other water soluble polymer that is covalently linked to the side chain of an amino acid residue at one or more of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 17, 21, 24, 29, 40 of said glucagon related analog peptide, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid. In some embodiments, the native amino acid at that position is substituted with an amino acid having a side chain suitable for crosslinking with hydrophilic moieties, to facilitate linkage of the hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. Exemplary amino acids include Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, or acetyl phenylalanine (Ac-Phe). In other embodiments, an amino acid modified to comprise a hydrophilic group is added to the peptide at the C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe hydrophilic moiety, e.g., polyethylene glycol chain in accordance with some embodiments has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 40,000 Daltons.

In yet other exemplary embodiments the hydrophilic moiety, e.g. polyethylene glycol chain, has a molecular weight of about 20,000 to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLinear or branched polymers are contemplated. Resulting preparations of conjugates may be essentially monodisperse or polydisperse, and may have about 0.5, 0.7, 1, 1.2, 1.5 or 2 polymer moieties per peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcylation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the glucagon related analog peptide (e.g. a \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide, \nClass\n 2 glucagon related analog peptide, \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide, \nClass\n 4 glucagon related analog peptide, \nClass\n 4 glucagon related analog peptides or \nClass\n 5 glucagon related analog peptide), is modified to comprise an acyl group. Acylation can be carried out at any position within the glucagon related analog peptide, including any of positions 1-29, a position within a C-terminal extension, or the C-terminal amino acid, provided that the activity exhibited by the non-acylated glucagon related analog peptide is retained upon acylation. For example, if the unacylated peptide has glucagon agonist activity, then the acylated peptide retains the glucagon agonist activity. Also for example, if the unacylated peptide has glucagon antagonist activity, then the acylated peptide retains the glucagon antagonist activity. For instance, if the unacylated peptide has GLP-1 agonist activity, then the acylated peptide retains GLP-1 agonist activity. Nonlimiting examples include acylation at \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28, or 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon). The acyl group can be covalently linked directly to an amino acid of the glucagon related analog peptide, or indirectly to an amino acid of the glucagon related analog peptide via a spacer, wherein the spacer is positioned between the amino acid of the glucagon related analog peptide and the acyl group. Glucagon related analog peptides may be acylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position. Nonlimiting examples include acylation at position 10 (according to the amino acid numbering of the wild type glucagon) and pegylation at one or more positions in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide, e.g., \n \nposition\n \n 24, 28 or 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of the wild type glucagon), within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminus (e.g., through adding a C-terminal Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific aspect of the invention, the glucagon related analog peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group by direct acylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a side chain of an amino acid of the glucagon related analog peptide.

In some specific embodiments of the invention, the direct acylation of the glucagon related analog peptide occurs through the side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of the amino acid at position 10 (according to the amino acid numbering of the wild type glucagon).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain amine is an amino acid of Formula VIII:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula VIII, is the amino acid wherein n is 4 (Lys) or n is 3 (Orn).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain hydroxyl is an amino acid of Formula IX:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula IX is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Ser).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the amino acid comprising a side chain thiol is an amino acid of Formula X:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn some exemplary embodiments, the amino acid of Formula X is the amino acid wherein n is 1 (Cys).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment of the invention, the acylated glucagon related analog peptide comprises a spacer between the peptide and the acyl group. In some embodiments, the glucagon related analog peptide is covalently bound to the spacer, which is covalently bound to the acyl group. In some exemplary embodiments, the glucagon related analog peptide is modified to comprise an acyl group by acylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a spacer, which spacer is attached to a side chain of an amino acid at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, or 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of the wild type glucagon), or at the C-terminal amino acid of the glucagon related analog peptide. The amino acid to which the spacer is attached can be any amino acid comprising a moiety which permits linkage to the spacer. For example, an amino acid comprising a side chain NH2, —OH, or —COOH (e.g., Lys, Orn, Ser, Asp, or Glu) is suitable. In this respect, the acylated glucagon related analog peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 612, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, and 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of the wild type glucagon) modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or carboxylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol, or a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through an amine group of a spacer the acylation can occur through the alpha amine of the amino acid or a side chain amine. In the instance in which the alpha amine is acylated, the spacer amino acid can be any amino acid. For example, the spacer amino acid can be a hydrophobic amino acid, e.g., Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Trp, Met, Phe, Tyr. Alternatively, the spacer amino acid can be an acidic residue, e.g., Asp and Glu. In the instance in which the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid is acylated, the spacer amino acid is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, e.g., an amino acid of Formula VIII (e.g., Lys or Orn). In this instance, it is possible for both the alpha amine and the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid to be acylated, such that the glucagon peptide is diacylated. Embodiments of the invention include such diacylated molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through a hydroxyl group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula IX. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Ser.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen acylation occurs through a thiol group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the dipeptide or tripeptide can be an amino acid of Formula X. In a specific exemplary embodiment, the amino acid is Cys.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the spacer comprises a hydrophilic bifunctional spacer. In a specific embodiment, the spacer comprises an amino poly(alkyloxy)carboxylate. In this regard, the spacer can comprise, for example, NH\n2\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n(CH\n2\n)\nm\nCOOH, wherein m is any integer from 1 to 6 and n is any integer from 2 to 12, such as, e.g., 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid, which is commercially available from Peptides International, Inc.

In some embodiments, the glucagon related analog peptide is covalently bound to the spacer, which is covalently bound to the alkyl group. In some exemplary embodiments, the glucagon related analog peptide is modified to comprise an alkyl group by alkylation of an amine, hydroxyl, or thiol of a spacer, which spacer is attached to a side chain of an amino acid at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, or 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) of the glucagon related analog peptide. The amino acid to which the spacer is attached can be any amino acid comprising a moiety which permits linkage to the spacer. For example, an amino acid comprising a side chain NH\n2\n, —OH, or —COOH (e.g., Lys, Orn, Ser, Asp, or Glu) is suitable. In this respect, the alkylated glucagon related analog peptide can comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 612, or a modified amino acid sequence thereof comprising one or more of the amino acid modifications described herein, with at least one of the amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 10, 20, 24, and 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) modified to any amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or carboxylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the spacer is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol or a dipeptide or tripeptide comprising an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, hydroxyl, or thiol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen alkylation occurs through an amine group of a spacer the alkylation can occur through the alpha amine of the amino acid or a side chain amine. In the instance in which the alpha amine is alkylated, the spacer amino acid can be any amino acid. For example, the spacer amino acid can be a hydrophobic amino acid, e.g., Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Trp, Met, Phe, Tyr. Alternatively, the spacer amino acid can be an acidic residue, e.g., Asp and Glu. In the instance in which the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid is alkylated, the spacer amino acid is an amino acid comprising a side chain amine, e.g., an amino acid of Formula VIII (e.g., Lys or Orn). In this instance, it is possible for both the alpha amine and the side chain amine of the spacer amino acid to be alkylated, such that the glucagon peptide is dialkylated. Embodiments of the invention include such dialkylated molecules.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen alkylation occurs through a hydroxyl group of a spacer, the amino acid or one of the amino acids of the spacer can be an amino acid of Formula IX.

In a specific embodiment, the spacer comprises an amino poly(alkyloxy)carboxylate. In this regard, the spacer can comprise, for example, NH\n2\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)\nn\n(CH\n2\n)\nm\nCOOH, wherein m is any integer from 1 to 6 and n is any integer from 2 to 12, such as, e.g., 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid, which is commercially available from Peptides International, Inc. (Louisville, Ky.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable methods of peptide alkylation via amines, hydroxyls, and thiols are known in the art. For example, a Williamson ether synthesis can be used to form an ether linkage between the glucagon related analog peptide and the alkyl group. Also, a nucleophilic substitution reaction of the peptide with an alkyl halide can result in any of an ether, thioether, or amino linkage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alkyl group of the alkylated glucagon related analog peptide can be of any size, e.g., any length carbon chain, and can be linear or branched. In some embodiments of the invention, the alkyl group is a C4 to C30 alkyl. For example, the alkyl group can be any of a C4 alkyl, C6 alkyl, C8 alkyl, C10 alkyl, C12 alkyl, C14 alkyl, C16 alkyl, C18 alkyl, C20 alkyl, C22 alkyl, C24 alkyl, C26 alkyl, C28 alkyl, or a C30 alkyl. In some embodiments, the alkyl group is a C8 to C20 alkyl, e.g., a C14 alkyl or a C16 alkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, the alkyl group comprises a steroid moiety of a bile acid, e.g., cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, taurocholic acid, glycocholic acid, and cholesterol acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alkylated glucagon related analog peptides described herein can be further modified to comprise a hydrophilic moiety. In some specific embodiments the hydrophilic moiety can comprise a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain. The incorporation of a hydrophilic moiety can be accomplished through any suitable means, such as any of the methods described herein.

In some embodiments, the alkyl group is attached to position 10 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon), optionally via a spacer comprising Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, or Ac-Phe, and the hydrophilic moiety is incorporated at a Cys residue at \nposition\n 24.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the alkylated glucagon related analog peptide can comprise a spacer, wherein the spacer is both alkylated and modified to comprise the hydrophilic moiety. Nonlimiting examples of suitable spacers include a spacer comprising one or more amino acids selected from the group consisting of Cys, Lys, Orn, homo-Cys, and Ac-Phe.\n\n\n \nStabilization of the Alpha-Helix Structure\n\n\n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, an intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acid side chains to stabilize the three dimensional structure of the carboxy terminal portion (e.g., amino acids 12-29 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon)) of the glucagon related analog peptide. The two amino acid side chains can be linked to one another through hydrogen-bonding, ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 3 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions i and i+4, wherein i is any integer between 12 and 25 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25) according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon. More particularly, the side chains of the amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24 or 24 and 28 (amino acid pairs in which i=12, 16, 20, or 24) according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon are linked to one another and thus stabilize the glucagon alpha helix. Alternatively, i can be 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, wherein the amino acids at positions i and i+4 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 8 atoms, or about 7-9 atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are two amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions j and j+3, wherein j is any integer between 12 and 26 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, and 26) according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon. In some specific embodiments, j is 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, wherein amino acids at positions j and j+3 are joined by an intramolecular bridge, the size of the linker is about 6 atoms, or about 5 to 7 atoms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, the intramolecular bridge is formed between two amino acids that are 6 amino acids apart, e.g., amino acids at positions k and k+7, wherein k is any integer between 12 and 22 (e.g., 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22) according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon. In some specific embodiments, k is 12, 13, or 17. In an exemplary embodiment, k is 17.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of amino acid pairings that are capable of covalently bonding to form a six-atom linking bridge include Orn and Asp, Glu and an amino acid of Formula VIII, wherein n is 2, and homoglutamic acid and an amino acid of Formula VIII, wherein n is 1, wherein Formula VIII is:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of amino acid pairing that are capable of covalently bonding to form a seven-atom linking bridge include Orn-Glu (lactam ring); Lys-Asp (lactam); or Homoser-Homoglu (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form an eight-atom linker include Lys-Glu (lactam); Homolys-Asp (lactam); Orn-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Asp (lactam); or Tyr-Asp (lactone). Examples of amino acid pairings that may form a nine-atom linker include Homolys-Glu (lactam); Lys-Homoglu (lactam); 4-aminoPhe-Glu (lactam); or Tyr-Glu (lactone). Any of the side chains on these amino acids may additionally be substituted with additional chemical groups, so long as the three-dimensional structure of the alpha-helix is not disrupted. One of ordinary skill in the art can envision alternative pairings or alternative amino acid analogs, including chemically modified derivatives, that would create a stabilizing structure of similar size and desired effect. For example, a homocysteine-homocysteine disulfide bridge is 6 atoms in length and may be further modified to provide the desired effect. Even without covalent linkage, the amino acid pairings described above or similar pairings that one of ordinary skill in the art can envision may also provide added stability to the alpha-helix through non-covalent bonds, for example, through formation of salt bridges or hydrogen-bonding interactions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe size of a lactam ring can vary depending on the length of the amino acid side chains, and in one embodiment the lactam is formed by linking the side chains of a lysine amino acid to a glutamic acid side chain. Further exemplary embodiments (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon) include the following pairings, optionally with a lactam bridge: Glu at \nposition\n 12 with Lys at position 16; native Lys at \nposition\n 12 with Glu at position 16; Glu at position 16 with Lys at \nposition\n 20; Lys at position 16 with Glu at \nposition\n 20; Glu at \nposition\n 20 with Lys at \nposition\n 24; Lys at \nposition\n 20 with Glu at \nposition\n 24; Glu at \nposition\n 24 with Lys at \nposition\n 28; Lys at \nposition\n 24 with Glu at \nposition\n 28. Alternatively, the order of the amide bond in the lactam ring can be reversed (e.g., a lactam ring can be formed between the side chains of a \nLys\n 12 and a Glu 16 or alternatively between a \nGlu\n 12 and a Lys16).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntramolecular bridges other than a lactam bridge can be used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon related analog peptides. In one embodiment, the intramolecular bridge is a hydrophobic bridge. In this instance, the intramolecular bridge optionally is between the side chains of two amino acids that are part of the hydrophobic face of the alpha helix of the glucagon related analog peptide. For example, one of the amino acids joined by the hydrophobic bridge can be the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 10, 14, and 18 (according to the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific aspect, olefin metathesis is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon related analog peptide using an all-hydrocarbon cross-linking system. The glucagon related analog peptide in this instance can comprise α-methylated amino acids bearing olefinic side chains of varying length and configured with either R or S stereochemistry at the i and i+4 or i+7 positions. For example, the olefinic side can comprise (CH\n2\n)n, wherein n is any integer between 1 to 6. In one embodiment, n is 3 for a cross-link length of 8 atoms. Suitable methods of forming such intramolecular bridges are described in the art. See, for example, Schafmeister et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n122: 5891-5892 (2000) and Walensky et al., \nScience \n305: 1466-1470 (2004). Alternatively, the glucagon peptide can comprise O-allyl Ser residues located on adjacent helical turns, which are bridged together via ruthenium-catalyzed ring closing metathesis. Such procedures of cross-linking are described in, for example, Blackwell et al., \nAngew, Chem., Int. Ed. \n37: 3281-3284 (1998).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another specific aspect, use of the unnatural thio-dialanine amino acid, lanthionine, which has been widely adopted as a peptidomimetic of cystine, is used to cross-link one turn of the alpha helix. Suitable methods of lanthionine-based cyclization are known in the art. See, for instance, Matteucci et al., \nTetrahedron Letters \n45: 1399-1401 (2004); Mayer et al., \nJ. Peptide Res. \n51: 432-436 (1998); Polinsky et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n35: 4185-4194 (1992); Osapay et al., \nJ. Med. Chem. \n40: 2241-2251 (1997); Fukase et al., \nBull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. \n65: 2227-2240 (1992); Harpp et al., \nJ. Org. Chem. \n36: 73-80 (1971); Goodman and Shao, \nPure Appl. Chem. \n68: 1303-1308 (1996); and Osapay and Goodman, \nJ. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. \n1599-1600 (1993).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, α,ω-diaminoalkane tethers, e.g., 1,4-diaminopropane and 1,5-diaminopentane) between two Glu residues at positions i and i+7 are used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon peptide. Such tethers lead to the formation of a bridge 9-atoms or more in length, depending on the length of the diaminoalkane tether. Suitable methods of producing peptides cross-linked with such tethers are described in the art. See, for example, Phelan et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n119: 455-460 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment of the invention, a disulfide bridge is used to cross-link one or two turns of the alpha helix of the glucagon related analog peptide. Alternatively, a modified disulfide bridge in which one or both sulfur atoms are replaced by a methylene group resulting in an isosteric macrocyclization is used to stabilize the alpha helix of the glucagon related analog peptide. Suitable methods of modifying peptides with disulfide bridges or sulfur-based cyclization are described in, for example, Jackson et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n113: 9391-9392 (1991) and Rudinger and Jost, \nExperientia \n20: 570-571 (1964).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the alpha helix of the glucagon related analog peptide is stabilized via the binding of metal atom by two His residues or a His and Cys pair positioned at i and i+4. The metal atom can be, for example, Ru(III), Cu(II), Zn(II), or Cd(II). Such methods of metal binding-based alpha helix stabilization are known in the art. See, for example, Andrews and Tabor, \nTetrahedron \n55: 11711-11743 (1999); Ghadiri et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n112: 1630-1632 (1990); and Ghadiri et al., \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n119: 9063-9064 (1997).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe alpha helix of the glucagon related analog peptide can alternatively be stabilized through other means of peptide cyclizing, which means are reviewed in Davies, \nJ. Peptide. Sci. \n9: 471-501 (2003). The alpha helix can be stabilized via the formation of an amide bridge, thioether bridge, thioester bridge, urea bridge, carbamate bridge, sulfonamide bridge, and the like. For example, a thioester bridge can be formed between the C-terminus and the side chain of a Cys residue. Alternatively, a thioester can be formed via side chains of amino acids having a thiol (Cys) and a carboxylic acid (e.g., Asp, Glu). In another method, a cross-linking agent, such as a dicarboxylic acid, e.g. suberic acid (octanedioic acid), etc. can introduce a link between two functional groups of an amino acid side chain, such as a free amino, hydroxyl, thiol group, and combinations thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, the alpha helix of the glucagon related analog peptide is stabilized through the incorporation of hydrophobic amino acids at positions i and i+4. For instance, i can be Tyr and i+4 can be either Val or Leu; i can be Phe and i+4 can be Cys or Met; I can be Cys and i+4 can be Met; or i can be Phe and i+4 can be Ile. It should be understood that, for purposes herein, the above amino acid pairings can be reversed, such that the indicated amino acid at position i could alternatively be located at i+4, while the i+4 amino acid can be located at the i position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with other embodiments of the invention, wherein glucagon related analog peptide is a peptide having glucagon agonist activity, GIP agonist activity, glucagon antagonist and GLP-1 activity, the alpha helix is stabilized through incorporation (either by amino acid substitution or insertion) of one or more alpha helix-stabilizing amino acids at the C-terminal portion of the glucagon related analog peptide (around amino acids 12-29 according to the numbering of the amino acid numbering of wild type glucagon). In a specific embodiment, the alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid is an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, including, but not limited to any of amino iso-butyric acid (AIB), an amino acid disubstituted with the same or a different group selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl, and n-butyl, or with a cyclooctane or cycloheptane (e.g., 1-aminocyclooctane-1-carboxylic acid). In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 of the glucagon related analog peptide is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid. In a specific embodiment, one, two, three or all of \n \npositions\n \n 16, 20, 21, and 24 are substituted with AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present disclosure also encompasses conjugates in which a glucagon related analog peptide (e.g. a \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide, \nClass\n 2 glucagon related analog peptide, \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide, \nClass\n 4 glucagon related analog peptide, or \nClass\n 5 glucagon related analog peptide), is linked, optionally via covalent bonding and optionally via a linker, to a conjugate moiety. Linkage can be accomplished by covalent chemical bonds, physical forces such electrostatic, hydrogen, ionic, van der Waals, or hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions. A variety of non-covalent coupling systems may be used, including biotin-avidin, ligand/receptor, enzyme/substrate, nucleic acid/nucleic acid binding protein, lipid/lipid binding protein, cellular adhesion molecule partners; or any binding partners or fragments thereof which have affinity for each other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glucagon related analog peptide can be linked to conjugate moieties via direct covalent linkage by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the peptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N- or C-terminal residues of these targeted amino acids. Reactive groups on the peptide or conjugate moiety include, e.g., an aldehyde, amino, ester, thiol, α-haloacetyl, maleimido or hydrazino group. Derivatizing agents include, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride or other agents known in the art. Alternatively, the conjugate moieties can be linked to the peptide indirectly through intermediate carriers, such as polysaccharide or polypeptide carriers. Examples of polysaccharide carriers include aminodextran. Examples of suitable polypeptide carriers include polylysine, polyglutamic acid, polyaspartic acid, co-polymers thereof, and mixed polymers of these amino acids and others, e.g., serines, to confer desirable solubility properties on the resultant loaded carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCysteinyl residues most commonly are reacted with α-haloacetates (and corresponding amines), such as chloroacetic acid or chloroacetamide, to give carboxymethyl or carboxyamidomethyl derivatives. Cysteinyl residues also are derivatized by reaction with bromotrifluoroacetone, alpha-bromo-β-(5-imidozoyl)propionic acid, chloroacetyl phosphate, N-alkylmaleimides, 3-nitro-2-pyridyl disulfide, methyl 2-pyridyl disulfide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol, or chloro-7-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHistidyl residues are derivatized by reaction with diethylpyrocarbonate at pH 5.5-7.0 because this agent is relatively specific for the histidyl side chain. Para-bromophenacyl bromide also is useful; the reaction is preferably performed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate at pH 6.0.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLysinyl and amino-terminal residues are reacted with succinic or other carboxylic acid anhydrides. Derivatization with these agents has the effect of reversing the charge of the lysinyl residues. Other suitable reagents for derivatizing alpha-amino-containing residues include imidoesters such as methyl picolinimidate, pyridoxal phosphate, pyridoxal, chloroborohydride, trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, O-methylisourea, 2,4-pentanedione, and transaminase-catalyzed reaction with glyoxylate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nArginyl residues are modified by reaction with one or several conventional reagents, among them phenylglyoxal, 2,3-butanedione, 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and ninhydrin. Derivatization of arginine residues requires that the reaction be performed in alkaline conditions because of the high pK\na \nof the guanidine functional group. Furthermore, these reagents may react with the groups of lysine as well as the arginine epsilon-amino group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specific modification of tyrosyl residues may be made, with particular interest in introducing spectral labels into tyrosyl residues by reaction with aromatic diazonium compounds or tetranitromethane. Most commonly, N-acetylimidizole and tetranitromethane are used to form O-acetyl tyrosyl species and 3-nitro derivatives, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarboxyl side groups (aspartyl or glutamyl) are selectively modified by reaction with carbodiimides (R—N═C═N—R′), where R and R′ are different alkyl groups, such as 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinyl-4-ethyl)carbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl)carbodiimide. Furthermore, aspartyl and glutamyl residues are converted to asparaginyl and glutaminyl residues by reaction with ammonium ions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther modifications include hydroxylation of proline and lysine, phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues, methylation of the alpha-amino groups of lysine, arginine, and histidine side chains (T. E. Creighton, Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties, W.H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco, pp. 79-86 (1983)), deamidation of asparagine or glutamine, acetylation of the N-terminal amine, and/or amidation or esterification of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of covalent modification involves chemically or enzymatically coupling glycosides to the peptide. Sugar(s) may be attached to (a) arginine and histidine, (b) free carboxyl groups, (c) free sulfhydryl groups such as those of cysteine, (d) free hydroxyl groups such as those of serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline, (e) aromatic residues such as those of tyrosine, or tryptophan, or (f) the amide group of glutamine. These methods are described in WO87/05330 published 11 Sep. 1987, and in Aplin and Wriston, CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem., pp. 259-306 (1981).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary conjugate moieties that can be linked to any of the glucagon related analog peptides described herein include but are not limited to a heterologous peptide or polypeptide (including for example, a plasma protein), a targeting agent, an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region), a diagnostic label such as a radioisotope, fluorophore or enzymatic label, a polymer including water soluble polymers, or other therapeutic or diagnostic agents. In one embodiment a conjugate is provided comprising a glucagon related analog peptide of the present invention and a plasma protein, wherein the plasma protein is selected from the group consisting of albumin, transferin, fibrinogen and globulins. In one embodiment the plasma protein moiety of the conjugate is albumin or transferin. In some embodiments, the linker comprises a chain of atoms from 1 to about 60, or 1 to 30 atoms or longer, 2 to 5 atoms, 2 to 10 atoms, 5 to 10 atoms, or 10 to 20 atoms long. In some embodiments, the chain atoms are all carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the chain atoms in the backbone of the linker are selected from the group consisting of C, O, N, and S. Chain atoms and linkers may be selected according to their expected solubility (hydrophilicity) so as to provide a more soluble conjugate. In some embodiments, the linker provides a functional group that is subject to cleavage by an enzyme or other catalyst or hydrolytic conditions found in the target tissue or organ or cell. In some embodiments, the length of the linker is long enough to reduce the potential for steric hindrance. If the linker is a covalent bond or a peptidyl bond and the conjugate is a polypeptide, the entire conjugate can be a fusion protein. Such peptidyl linkers may be any length. Exemplary linkers are from about 1 to 50 amino acids in length, 5 to 50, 3 to 5, 5 to 10, 5 to 15, or 10 to 30 amino acids in length. Such fusion proteins may alternatively be produced by recombinant genetic engineering methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs noted above, in some embodiments, the glucagon related analog peptides are conjugated, e.g., fused to an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region). Known types of immunoglobulins (Ig) include IgG, IgA, IgE, IgD or IgM. The Fc region is a C-terminal region of an Ig heavy chain, which is responsible for binding to Fc receptors that carry out activities such as recycling (which results in prolonged half-life), antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, according to some definitions the human IgG heavy chain Fc region stretches from Cys226 to the C-terminus of the heavy chain. The “hinge region” generally extends from Glu216 to Pro230 of human IgG1 (hinge regions of other IgG isotypes may be aligned with the IgG1 sequence by aligning the cysteines involved in cysteine bonding). The Fc region of an IgG includes two constant domains, CH2 and CH3. The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 231 to amino acid 341. The CH3 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 342 to 447. References made to amino acid numbering of immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, or regions, are all based on Kabat et al. 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Public Health, Bethesda, Md. In a related embodiment, the Fc region may comprise one or more native or modified constant regions from an immunoglobulin heavy chain, other than CH1, for example, the CH2 and CH3 regions of IgG and IgA, or the CH3 and CH4 regions of IgE.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable conjugate moieties include portions of immunoglobulin sequence that include the FcRn binding site. FcRn, a salvage receptor, is responsible for recycling immunoglobulins and returning them to circulation in blood. The region of the Fc portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn receptor has been described based on X-ray crystallography (Burmeister et al. 1994, Nature 372:379). The major contact area of the Fc with the FcRn is near the junction of the CH2 and CH3 domains. Fc-FcRn contacts are all within a single Ig heavy chain. The major contact sites include amino acid residues 248, 250-257, 272, 285, 288, 290-291, 308-311, and 314 of the CH2 domain and amino acid residues 385-387, 428, and 433-436 of the CH3 domain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome conjugate moieties may or may not include FcγR binding site(s). FcγR are responsible for ADCC and CDC. Examples of positions within the Fc region that make a direct contact with FcγR are amino acids 234-239 (lower hinge region), amino acids 265-269 (B/C loop), amino acids 297-299 (C′/E loop), and amino acids 327-332 (F/G) loop (Sondermann et al., Nature 406: 267-273, 2000). The lower hinge region of IgE has also been implicated in the FcRI binding (Henry, et al., Biochemistry 36, 15568-15578, 1997). Residues involved in IgA receptor binding are described in Lewis et al., (J Immunol. 175:6694-701, 2005). Amino acid residues involved in IgE receptor binding are described in Sayers et al. (J Biol Chem. 279(34):35320-5, 2004).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAmino acid modifications may be made to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin. Such variant Fc regions comprise at least one amino acid modification in the CH3 domain of the Fc region (residues 342-447) and/or at least one amino acid modification in the CH2 domain of the Fc region (residues 231-341). Mutations believed to impart an increased affinity for FcRn include T256A, T307A, E380A, and N434A (Shields et al. 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). Other mutations may reduce binding of the Fc region to FcγRI, FcγRIIA, FcγRIIB, and/or FcγRIIIA without significantly reducing affinity for FcRn. For example, substitution of the Asn at position 297 of the Fc region with Ala or another amino acid removes a highly conserved N-glycosylation site and may result in reduced immunogenicity with concomitant prolonged half-life of the Fc region, as well as reduced binding to FcγRs (Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847; Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68:1632; Shields et al. 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591) Amino acid modifications at positions 233-236 of IgG1 have been made that reduce binding to FcγRs (Ward and Ghetie 1995, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77 and Armour et al. 1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613). Some exemplary amino acid substitutions are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,355,008 and 7,381,408, each incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFusion Peptides—C-Terminal Extension\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments a glucagon related analog peptide may comprise a C-terminus or a C-terminal amino acid sequence including but not limited to: COOH, CONH\n2\n, GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 624), GPSSGAPPPS-CONH\n2 \n(SEQ ID NO: 723), a oxyntomodulin carboxy terminal extension, KRNRNNIA (SEQ ID NO: 625) or KGKKNDWKHNITQ (SEQ ID NO: 662). For example, the terminal ten amino acids of Exendin-4 (i.e. the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 624 (GPSSGAPPPS)) are linked to the carboxy terminus of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide, \nClass\n 2 glucagon related analog peptide, \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide, \nClass\n 4 glucagon related analog peptide, or \nClass\n 5 glucagon related analog peptide of the present disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother compound that induces weight loss is oxyntomodulin, a naturally occurring digestive hormone found in the small intestine (see Diabetes 2005; 54:2390-2395). Oxyntomodulin is a 37 amino acid peptide (SEQ ID NO: 661) that contains the 29 amino acid sequence of glucagon followed by an 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 625 (KRNRNNIA). Accordingly, in one embodiment prodrug derivatives of glucagon related analog peptides are provided that further comprise the carboxy terminal extension of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 625 or a four amino acid extension having the sequence KRNR.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods for Making Glucagon Related Analog Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glucagon related analog peptides (and prodrugs) of this disclosed herein may be prepared by standard synthetic methods, recombinant DNA techniques, or any other methods of preparing peptides and fusion proteins. Although certain non-natural amino acids cannot be expressed by standard recombinant DNA techniques, techniques for their preparation are known in the art. Compounds of this invention that encompass non-peptide portions may be synthesized by standard organic chemistry reactions, in addition to standard peptide chemistry reactions when applicable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nClasses of glucagon related analog peptides are described in detail below. With respect to each of the sections of \n \n \n \n \ndisclosure concerning class\n \n \n \n \n 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 glucagon related analog peptides modifications are described with respect to the glucagon related analog peptide portion of a prodrug compound detailed above. Thus, structural elements described with regard to a class of glucagon related analog peptides are structural elements of a bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein which is then further modified to generate a prodrug compound as described above.\n\n\n \n \nClass\n 1 Glucagon Related Analog Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the glucagon related analog peptide is a \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide, which is described herein and in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2008/086086, published on Jul. 17, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/090,415, the contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivity\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nClass\n 1 glucagon peptides retain glucagon receptor activity relative to the native glucagon peptide (SEQ ID NO: 701). For example, the glucagon peptide can retain at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75% activity, 80% activity, 85% activity, or 90% of the activity of native glucagon (calculated as the inverse ratio of EC50s for the glucagon peptide vs. glucagon, e.g., as measured by cAMP production using the assay generally described in Example 2). In one embodiment, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptides have the same or greater activity (used synonymously with the term “potency” herein) than glucagon.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptides described herein may exhibit an EC50 at the human glucagon receptor of about 100 nM, 75 nM, 50 nM, 40 nM, 30 nM, 20 nM, 10 nM, 5 nM, 1 nM or less when tested for cAMP induction in HEK293 cells over-expressing glucagon receptor, e.g. using the assay of Example 2. Typically pegylated peptides will exhibit a higher EC50 compared to the unpegylated peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptides exhibit less than about 5%, 4%, 3%, 2% or 1% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor and/or a greater than about 5-fold, 10-fold, or 15-fold selectivity for glucagon receptor compared to GLP-1 receptor. For example, in some embodiments, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptides exhibit less than 5% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor and exhibit a greater than 5-fold selectivity for glucagon receptor compared to GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImproved Solubility\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNative glucagon exhibits poor solubility in aqueous solution, particularly at physiological pH, with a tendency to aggregate and precipitate over time. In contrast, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptides in one embodiment exhibit at least 2-fold, 5-fold, or even higher solubility compared to native glucagon at a pH between 6 and 8, or between 6 and 9, for example, at \npH\n 7 after 24 hours at 25° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in one embodiment, a \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide has been modified relative to the wild type peptide of His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr (SEQ ID NO: 701) to improve the peptide's solubility in aqueous solutions, particularly at a pH ranging from about 5.5 to about 8.0, while retaining the native peptide's biological activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor example, the solubility of any of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptides described herein can be further improved by attaching a hydrophilic moiety to the peptide. Introduction of such groups also increases duration of action, e.g. as measured by a prolonged half-life in circulation. Hydrophilic moieties are further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModification with Charged Residues\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, solubility is improved by adding charge to the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide by the substitution of native non-charged amino acids with charged amino acids selected from the group consisting of lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid, or by the addition of charged amino acids to the amino or carboxy terminus of the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide has improved solubility due to the fact that the peptide is modified by amino acid substitutions and/or additions that introduce a charged amino acid into the C-terminal portion of the peptide, and in one embodiment at a position C-terminal to position 27 of SEQ ID NO: 701. Optionally, one, two or three charged amino acids may be introduced within the C-terminal portion, and in one embodiment C-terminal to position 27. In accordance with one embodiment, the native amino acid(s) at \npositions\n 28 and/or 29 are substituted with a charged amino acid, and/or one to three charged amino acids are added to the C-terminus of the peptide, e.g. after \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 27, 28 or 29. In exemplary embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. In other embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are positively charged.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn specific exemplary embodiments, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide may comprise any one or two of the following modifications: substitution of N28 with E; substitution of N28 with D; substitution of T29 with D; substitution of T29 with E; insertion of E after \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 27, 28 or 29; insertion of D after \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 27, 28 or 29. For example, D28E29, E28E29, E29E30, E28E30, D28E30.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one exemplary embodiment, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide comprises an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 711, or an analog thereof that contains 1 to 3 further amino acid modifications (described herein in reference to glucagon agonists) relative to native glucagon, or a glucagon agonist analog thereof. SEQ ID NO: 711 represents a modified \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide, wherein the asparagine residue at \nposition\n 28 of the native protein has been substituted with an aspartic acid. In another exemplary embodiment the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide comprises an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 738, wherein the asparagine residue at \nposition\n 28 of the native protein has been substituted with glutamic acid. Other exemplary embodiments include \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptides of SEQ ID NOS: 724, 725, 726, 733, 735, 736 and 737.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstituting the normally occurring amino acid at \nposition\n 28 and/or 29 with charged amino acids, and/or the addition of one to two charged amino acids at the carboxy terminus of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide, enhances the solubility and stability of the glucagon peptides in aqueous solutions at physiologically relevant pHs (i.e., a pH of about 6.5 to about 7.5) by at least 5-fold and by as much as 30-fold. Accordingly, \nClass\n 1 glucagon peptides of one embodiment retain glucagon activity and exhibit at least 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 25-fold, 30-fold or greater solubility relative to native glucagon at a given pH between about 5.5 and 8, e.g., \npH\n 7, when measured after 24 hours at 25° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional modifications, e.g. conservative substitutions, which modifications are further described herein, may be made to the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide that still allow it to retain glucagon activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImproved Stability\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon peptides may additionally exhibit improved stability and/or reduced degradation, for example, retaining at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. Any of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptides disclosed herein may additionally exhibit improved stability at a pH within the range of 5.5 to 8, for example, retaining at least 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. The \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptides may include additional modifications that alter its pharmaceutical properties, e.g. increased potency, prolonged half-life in circulation, increased shelf-life, reduced precipitation or aggregation, and/or reduced degradation, e.g., reduced occurrence of cleavage or chemical modification after storage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet further exemplary embodiments, any of the foregoing \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptides can be further modified to improve stability by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 15 of SEQ ID NO: 701 to reduce degradation of the peptide over time, especially in acidic or alkaline buffers. In exemplary embodiments, Asp at \nposition\n 15 is substituted with a Glu, homo-Glu, cysteic acid, or homo-cysteic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, any of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptides described herein can be further modified to improve stability by modifying the amino acid at position 16 of SEQ ID NO: 701. In exemplary embodiments, Ser at position 16 is substituted with Thr or AIB, or any of the amino acids substitutions described herein with regard to \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptides which enhance potency at the glucagon receptor. Such modifications reduce cleavage of the peptide bond between Asp15-Ser16.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, any of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptides described herein can be further modified to reduce degradation at various amino acid positions by modifying any one, two, three, or all four of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 20, 21, 24, or 27. Exemplary embodiments include substitution of Gln at \nposition\n 20 with Ala or AIB, substitution of Asp at position 21 with Glu, substitution of Gln at \nposition\n 24 with Ala or AIB, substitution of Met at \nposition\n 27 with Leu or Nle. Removal or substitution of methionine reduces degradation due to oxidation of the methionine. Removal or substitution of Gln or Asn reduces degradation due to deamidation of Gln or Asn. Removal or substitution of Asp reduces degradation that occurs through dehydration of Asp to form a cyclic succinimide intermediate followed by isomerization to iso-aspartate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced Potency\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with another embodiment, \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptides are provided that have enhanced potency at the glucagon receptor, wherein the peptides comprise an amino acid modification at position 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 701). By way of nonlimiting example, such enhanced potency can be provided by substituting the naturally occurring serine at position 16 with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid, or a charged amino acid having a side chain containing at least one heteroatom, (e.g. N, O, S, P) and with a side chain length of about 4 (or 3-5) atoms. Substitution of serine at position 16 with glutamic acid enhances glucagon activity at least 2-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold and up to 10-fold greater at the glucagon receptor. In some embodiments, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide retains selectivity for the glucagon receptor relative to the GLP-1 receptors, e.g., at least 5-fold, 10-fold, or 15-fold selectivity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDPP-IV Resistance\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the \nClass\n 1 glucagon peptides disclosed herein are further modified at \n \nposition\n \n 1 or 2 to reduce susceptibility to cleavage by dipeptidyl peptidase IV. More particularly, in some embodiments, \nposition\n 1 and/or \nposition\n 2 of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide is substituted with the DPP-IV resistant amino acid(s) described herein. In one embodiment, \nposition\n 2 of the analog peptide is substituted with an amino isobutyric acid. In one embodiment, \nposition\n 2 of the analog peptide is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D-serine, D-alanine, glycine, N-methyl serine, and ε-amino butyric acid. In another embodiment, \nposition\n 2 of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D-serine, glycine, and aminoisobutyric acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReduction in glucagon activity upon modification of the amino acids at \nposition\n 1 and/or \nposition\n 2 of the glucagon peptide can be restored by stabilization of the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29). The alpha helix structure can be stabilized by, e.g., formation of a covalent or non-covalent intramolecular bridge (e.g., a lactam bridge between side chains of amino acids at positions “i” and “i+4”, wherein i is an integer from 12 to 25), substitution and/or insertion of amino acids around positions 12-29 with an alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid (e.g., an α,α-disubstituted amino acid), as further described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReducing Glucagon Activity by Modification at \nPosition\n 3\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon receptor activity can be reduced by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 3, e.g. substitution of the naturally occurring glutamine at \nposition\n 3 with any amino acid. Substitution at this position with an acidic, basic, or a hydrophobic amino acid (glutamic acid, ornithine, norleucine) substantially reduces or destroys glucagon receptor activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhancing GLP-1 Activity with C-Terminal Amides and Esters\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by replacing the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester. Conversely, retaining the native carboxylic acid at the C-terminus of the peptide maintains the relatively greater selectivity of the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide for the glucagon receptor vs. the GLP-1 receptor (e.g., greater than about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20-fold).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther Modifications and Combinations\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional modifications may be made to the \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide which may further increase solubility and/or stability and/or glucagon activity. The \nClass\n 1 glucagon related analog peptide may alternatively comprise other modifications that do not substantially affect solubility or stability, and that do not substantially decrease glucagon activity.

Substitution with LAG at positions 27-29 provides increased GIP activity relative to the native MNT sequence at those positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GIP receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 12. For example, \nposition\n 12 is substituted with a large, aliphatic, nonpolar amino acid, optionally Ile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GIP receptor is also provided by an amino acid modification at positions 17 and/or 18. For example, position 17 is substituted with a polar residue, optionally Gln, and position 18 is substituted with a small aliphatic amino acid, optionally Ala. A substitution with QA at positions 17 and 18 provides increased GIP activity relative to the native RR sequence at those positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GIP receptor is provided by modifications that permit formation of an intramolecular bridge between amino acid side chains at positions from 12 to 29. For example, an intramolecular bridge can be formed by a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids at positions i and i+4 or between positions j and j+3, or between positions k and k+7. In exemplary embodiments, the bridge is between \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24, 24 and 28, or 17 and 20. In other embodiments, non-covalent interactions such as salt bridges can be formed between positively and negatively charged amino acids at these positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the modifications described above which increase GIP receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Combinations of the modifications that increase GIP receptor activity generally provide higher GIP activity than any of such modifications taken alone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications that Affect Glucagon Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, enhanced glucagon potency is provided by an amino acid modification at position 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 801). By way of nonlimiting example, such enhanced potency can be provided by substituting the naturally occurring serine at position 16 with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid, or a charged amino acid having a side chain containing at least one heteroatom, (e.g. N, O, S, P) and with a side chain length of about 4 (or 3-5) atoms. In some embodiments the glucagon peptide retains its original selectivity for the glucagon receptor relative to the GLP-1 receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlucagon receptor activity can be reduced by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 3, e.g. substitution of the naturally occurring glutamine at \nposition\n 3 with any amino acid. Substitution at this position with an acidic, basic, or a hydrophobic amino acid (glutamic acid, ornithine, norleucine) has been shown to substantially reduce or destroy glucagon receptor activity. In such cases, pegylation of such a peptide comprising a substitution at \nposition\n 3 increased the glucagon receptor activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRestoration of glucagon activity which has been reduced by amino acid modifications at \n \npositions\n \n 1 and 2 is provided by modifications that permit formation of an intramolecular bridge between amino acid side chains at positions from 12 to 29. For example, an intramolecular bridge can be formed by a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids at positions i and i+4 or between positions j and j+3, or between positions k and k+7. In other embodiments, non-covalent interactions such as salt bridges can be formed between positively and negatively charged amino acids at these positions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications that Affect GLP-1 Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by replacing the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is also provided by stabilizing the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (around amino acids 12-29), e.g., through formation of an intramolecular bridge between the side chains of two amino acids, or substitution and/or insertion of amino acids around positions 12-29 with an alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid (e.g., an α,α-disubstituted amino acid), as further described herein. In exemplary embodiments, the side chains of the amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 13 and 17, 16 and 20 , 17 and 21, 20 and 24 or 24 and 28 (amino acid pairs in which i=12, 16, 20, or 24) are linked to one another and thus stabilize the glucagon alpha helix. In some embodiments, the bridge or linker is about 8 (or about 7-9) atoms in length, particularly when the bridge is between positions i and i+4. In some embodiments, the bridge or linker is about 6 (or about 5-7) atoms in length, particularly when the bridge is between positions j and j+3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, intramolecular bridges are formed by (a) substituting the naturally occurring serine at position 16 with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid, or a charged amino acid having a side chain containing at least one heteroatom, (e.g. N, O, S, P) and with a side chain length of about 4 (or 3-5) atoms, and (b) substituting the naturally occurring glutamine at \nposition\n 20 with another hydrophilic amino acid having a side chain that is either charged or has an ability to hydrogen-bond, and is at least about 5 (or about 4-6) atoms in length, for example, lysine, citrulline, arginine, or ornithine. The side chains of such amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20 can form a salt bridge or can be covalently linked. In one embodiment the two amino acids are bound to one another to form a lactam ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, stabilization of the alpha helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide is achieved through the formation of an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur-containing bridge formation, the use of α,ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization are used to stabilize the alpha helix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet other embodiments, one or more α,α-disubstituted amino acids are inserted or substituted into this C-terminal portion (amino acids 12-29) at positions that retain the desired activity. For example, one, two, three or all of \n \npositions\n \n 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid, e.g., AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 20 as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by adding GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 895) or XGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 896) to the C-terminus GLP-1 activity in such analogs can be further increased by modifying the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 18, 28 or 29, or at \nposition\n 18 and 29, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further modest increase in GLP-1 potency is provided by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 to be a large, aromatic amino acid residue, optionally Trp.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReduced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided, e.g., by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 7 as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPotency at the GLP-1 receptor can be further enhanced by an alanine substitution for the native arginine at position 18.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the modifications described above in reference to a \nClass\n 2 glucagon related analog peptide which increase GLP-1 receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Combinations of the modifications that increase GLP-1 receptor activity generally provide higher GLP-1 activity than any of such modifications taken alone. For example, the invention provides glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at position 16, at \nposition\n 20, and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20; glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at position 16 and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group; glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at \npositions\n 16 and 20, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20; and glucagon peptides that comprise modifications at \nposition\n 20 and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications that Improve DPP-IV Resistance\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications at \nposition\n 1 and/or 2 can increase the peptide's resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) cleavage. For example, \nposition\n 1 and/or \nposition\n 2 may be substituted with a DPP-IV resistant amino acid as described herein. In one embodiment, the amino acid at \nposition\n 2 is substituted with N-methyl alanine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was observed that modifications at position 2 (e.g. AIB at position 2) and in some cases modifications at position 1 (e.g., DMIA at position 1) may reduce glucagon activity, sometimes significantly; surprisingly, this reduction in glucagon activity can be restored by stabilizing the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (around amino acids 12-29), e.g., through formation of a covalent bond between the side chains of two amino acids, as described herein. In some embodiments, the covalent bond is between amino acids at positions “i” and “i+4”, or positions “j” and “j+3”, e.g., between \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 and 16, 16 and 20, 20 and 24, 24 and 28, or 17 and 20. In exemplary embodiments, this covalent bond is a lactam bridge between a glutamic acid at position 16 and a lysine at \nposition\n 20. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications that Reduce Degradation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet further exemplary embodiments, any of the \nClass\n 2 glucagon related analog peptides can be further modified to improve stability by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 15 and/or 16 of SEQ ID NO: 801 to reduce degradation of the peptide over time, especially in acidic or alkaline buffers. Such modifications reduce cleavage of the Asp15-Ser16 peptide bond. In exemplary embodiments, the amino acid modification at \nposition\n 15 is a deletion or substitution of Asp with glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, cysteic acid or homocysteic acid. In other exemplary embodiments, the amino acid modification at position 16 is a deletion or substitution of Ser with Thr or AIB. In other exemplary embodiments, Ser at position 16 is substituted with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the methionine residue present at \nposition\n 27 of the native peptide is modified, e.g. by deletion or substitution. Such modifications may prevent oxidative degradation of the peptide. In some embodiments, the Met at \nposition\n 27 is substituted with leucine, isoleucine or norleucine. In some specific embodiments, Met at \nposition\n 27 is substituted with leucine or norleucine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the Gln at \nposition\n 20 and/or 24 is modified, e.g. by deletion or substitution. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through deamidation of Gln. In some embodiments, the Gln at \nposition\n 20 and/or 24 is substituted with Ala or AIB. In some embodiments the Gln at \nposition\n 20 and/or 24 is substituted with Lys, Arg, Orn, or Citrulline.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the Asp at position 21 is modified, e.g. by deletion or substitution. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through dehydration of Asp to form a cyclic succinimide intermediate followed by isomerization to iso-aspartate. In some embodiments, position 21 is substituted with Glu, homoglutamic acid or homocysteic acid. In some specific embodiments, position 21 is substituted with Glu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStabilization of the Alpha Helix Structure\n\n\n \n \n \n \nStabilization of the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the \nClass\n 2 glucagon related analog peptide (around amino acids 12-29) provides enhanced GLP-1 and/or GIP activity and restores glucagon activity which has been reduced by amino acid modifications at \npositions\n 1 and/or 2. The alpha helix structure can be stabilized by, e.g., formation of a covalent or non-covalent intramolecular bridge, or substitution and/or insertion of amino acids around positions 12-29 with an alpha helix-stabilizing amino acid (e.g., an α,α-disubstituted amino acid). Stabilization of the alpha-helix structure of a GIP agonist may be accomplished as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcylation and Alkylation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with some embodiments, the glucagon peptides disclosed herein are modified to comprise an acyl group or alkyl group as described herein. Acylation or alkylation can increase the half-life of the glucagon peptides in circulation. Acylation or alkylation can advantageously delay the onset of action and/or extend the duration of action at the glucagon and/or GLP-1 receptors and/or improve resistance to proteases such as DPP-IV and/or improve solubility. Activity at the glucagon and/or GLP-1 and/or GIP receptors of the glucagon peptide may be maintained after acylation. In some embodiments, the potency of the acylated glucagon peptides is comparable to the unacylated versions of the glucagon peptides. \nClass\n 2 glucagon related analog peptides may be acylated or alkylated at the same amino acid position where a hydrophilic moiety is linked, or at a different amino acid position, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the invention provides a glucagon peptide modified to comprise an acyl group or alkyl group covalently linked to the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide. The glucagon peptide may further comprise a spacer between the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 of the glucagon peptide and the acyl group or alkyl group. In some embodiments, the acyl group is a fatty acid or bile acid, or salt thereof, e.g. a C4 to C30 fatty acid, a C8 to C24 fatty acid, cholic acid, a C4 to C30 alkyl, a C8 to C24 alkyl, or an alkyl comprising a steroid moiety of a bile acid. The spacer is any moiety with suitable reactive groups for attaching acyl or alkyl groups. In exemplary embodiments, the spacer comprises an amino acid, a dipeptide, or a tripeptide, or a hydrophilic bifunctional spacer. In some embodiments, the spacer is selected from the group consisting of: Trp, Glu, Asp, Cys and a spacer comprising NH\n2\n(CH\n2\nCH\n2\nO)n(CH\n2\n)mCOOH, wherein m is any integer from 1 to 6 and n is any integer from 2 to 12. Such acylated or alkylated glucagon peptides may also further comprise a hydrophilic moiety, optionally a polyethylene glycol. Any of the foregoing glucagon peptides may comprise two acyl groups or two alkyl groups, or a combination thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConjugates and Fusions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe GIP agonist can be linked, optionally via covalent bonding and optionally via a linker, to a conjugate moiety as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the second peptide is XGPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 896), wherein X is selected from one of the 20 common amino acids, e.g., glutamic acid, aspartic acid or glycine. In one embodiment X represents an amino acid, for example Cys, that further comprises a hydrophilic moiety covalently linked to the side chain of that amino acid. Such C-terminal extensions improve solubility and also can improve GIP or GLP-1 activity. In some embodiments wherein the glucagon peptide further comprises a carboxy terminal extension, the carboxy terminal amino acid of the extension ends in an amide group or an ester group rather than a carboxylic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, e.g., in glucagon peptides which comprise the C-terminal extension, the threonine at \nposition\n 29 of the native glucagon peptide is replaced with a glycine. For example, a glucagon peptide having a glycine substitution for threonine at \nposition\n 29 and comprising the C-terminal extension of GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 895) is four times as potent at the GLP-1 receptor as native glucagon modified to comprise the same C-terminal extension. This T29G substitution can be used in conjunction with other modifications disclosed herein to enhance the affinity of the glucagon peptides for the GLP-1 receptor. For example, the T29G substitution can be combined with the S16E and N20K amino acid substitutions, optionally with a lactam bridge between \namino acids\n 16 and 20, and optionally with addition of a PEG chain as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments an amino acid is added to the C-terminus, and the additional amino acid is selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid, aspartic acid and glycine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications that Enhance Solubility\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the solubility of any of the glucagon peptides can be improved by amino acid substitutions and/or additions that introduce a charged amino acid into the C-terminal portion of the peptide, preferably at a position C-terminal to position 27 of SEQ ID NO: 801. Optionally, one, two or three charged amino acids may be introduced within the C-terminal portion, preferably C-terminal to position 27. In some embodiments the native amino acid(s) at \npositions\n 28 and/or 29 are substituted with one or two charged amino acids, and/or in a further embodiment one to three charged amino acids are also added to the C-terminus of the peptide. In exemplary embodiments, one, two or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. In some embodiments, the negatively charged (acidic amino acid) is aspartic acid or glutamic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional modifications, e.g. conservative substitutions, may be made to the glucagon peptide that still allow it to retain GIP activity (and optionally GLP-1 activity and/or glucagon activity).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther Modifications\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAny of the modifications described above in reference to a \nClass\n 2 peptide which increase or decrease GIP activity, which increase or decrease glucagon receptor activity, and which increase GLP-1 receptor activity can be applied individually or in combination. Any of the modifications described above in reference to a \nClass\n 2 glucagon related analog peptide can also be combined with other modifications that confer other desirable properties, such as increased solubility and/or stability and/or duration of action, as described herein with regard to \nClass\n 2 glucagon related analog peptides. Alternatively, any of the modifications described above in reference to \nClass\n 2 glucaton related peptides can be combined with other modifications described herein in reference to \nClass\n 2 glucagon related analog peptides that do not substantially affect solubility or stability or activity. Exemplary modifications include but are not limited to:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(A) Improving solubility, for example, by introducing one, two, three or more charged amino acid(s) to the C-terminal portion of native glucagon, preferably at a position C-terminal to position 27. Such a charged amino acid can be introduced by substituting a native amino acid with a charged amino acid, e.g. at \n \npositions\n \n 28 or 29, or alternatively by adding a charged amino acid, e.g. after \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 27, 28 or 29. In exemplary embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are negatively charged. In other embodiments, one, two, three or all of the charged amino acids are positively charged. Such modifications increase solubility, e.g. provide at least 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 25-fold, 30-fold or greater solubility relative to native glucagon at a given pH between about 5.5 and 8, e.g., \npH\n 7, when measured after 24 hours at 25° C.\n \n(B) Increasing solubility and duration of action or half-life in circulation by addition of a hydrophilic moiety such as a polyethylene glycol chain, as described herein, e.g. at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 16, 17, 20, 21, 24 or 29, within a C-terminal extension, or at the C-terminal amino acid of the peptide,\n \n(C) Increasing solubility and/or duration of action or half-life in circulation and/or delaying the onset of action by acylation or alkylation of the glucagon peptide, as described herein;\n \n(D) Increasing duration of action or half-life in circulation through introducing resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) cleavage by modification of the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 1 or 2 as described herein.\n \n(E) Increasing stability by modification of the Asp at \nposition\n 15, for example, by deletion or substitution with glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, cysteic acid or homocysteic acid. Such modifications can reduce degradation or cleavage at a pH within the range of 5.5 to 8, for example, retaining at least 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. Such modifications reduce cleavage of the peptide bond between Asp15-Ser16.\n \n(F) Increasing stability by modification of the Ser at position 16, for example by substitution with Thr or AIB. Such modifications also reduce cleavage of the peptide bond between Asp15-Ser16.\n \n(G) Increasing stability by modification of the methionine at \nposition\n 27, for example, by substitution with leucine or norleucine. Such modifications can reduce oxidative degradation. Stability can also be increased by modification of the Gln at \n \nposition\n \n 20 or 24, e.g. by substitution with Ala or AIB. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through deamidation of Gln. Stability can be increased by modification of Asp at position 21, e.g. by substitution with Glu. Such modifications can reduce degradation that occurs through dehydration of Asp to form a cyclic succinimide intermediate followed by isomerization to iso-aspartate.\n \n(H) Non-conservative or conservative substitutions, additions or deletions that do not substantially affect activity, for example, conservative substitutions at one or more of \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28 or 29; substitution of one or more of these positions with Ala; deletion of amino acids at one or more of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 27, 28 or 29; or deletion of \namino acid\n 29 optionally combined with a C-terminal amide or ester in place of the C-terminal carboxylic acid group; substitution of Lys at \nposition\n 12 with Arg; substitution of Tyr at \nposition\n 10 with Val or Phe;\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nPreservation of activity after pegylation is provided by the addition of GPSSGAPPPS (SEQ ID NO: 895) to the C-terminus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome positions of the native glucagon peptide can be modified while retaining at least some of the activities of the parent peptide. Accordingly, applicants anticipate that one or more of the amino acids located at positions at \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 28 or 29 can be substituted with an amino acid different from that present in the native glucagon peptide, and still retain activity at the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, position 18 is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of Ala, Ser, or Thr. In some embodiments the amino acid at \nposition\n 20 is substituted with Lys, Arg, Orn, Citrulline or AIB. In some embodiments, position 21 is substituted with Glu, homoglutamic acid or homocysteic acid. In some embodiments, the glucagon peptide comprises 1 to 10 amino acid modifications selected from \n \n \n \n \n \npositions\n \n \n \n \n \n 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 27, 28 and 29. In exemplary embodiments, the modifications are one or more amino acid substitutions selected from the group consisting of Gln17, Ala18, Glu21, Ile23, Ala24, Val27 and Gly29. In some embodiments, 1 to 2 amino acids selected from positions 17-26 differ from the parent peptide. In other embodiments, 1 to 2 amino acids selected from positions 17-22 differ from the parent peptide. In yet other embodiments, the modifications are Gln17, Ala18, Glu21, Ile23 and Ala24.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, one or more amino acids is added to the carboxy terminus of the glucagon peptide.

In exemplary embodiments, this hydrophilic moiety is covalently linked to a Lys, Cys, Orn, homocysteine, or acetyl-phenylalanine residue at any of these positions. Exemplary hydrophilic moieties include polyethylene glycol (PEG), for example, of a molecular weight of about 1,000 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons, or about 20,000 Daltons to about 40,000 Daltons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe GIP agonist may be a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence of any of the amino acid sequences, e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 805-894, optionally with up to 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 further modifications that retain GIP agonist activity.\n\n\n \n \nClass\n 3 Glucagon Related Analog Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nIn certain embodiments, the glucagon related analog peptide is a \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide, which is described herein and in International Patent Application Publication No. WO 2008/101017, published on Aug. 21, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/090,412, the contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide can be a peptide that exhibits increased activity at the glucagon receptor, and in further embodiments exhibits enhanced biophysical stability and/or aqueous solubility. In addition, in one embodiment, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide has lost native glucagon's selectivity for the glucagon receptor verses the GLP-1 receptor, and thus represents co-agonists of those two receptors. Selected amino acid modifications within the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide can control the relative activity of the peptide at the GLP-1 receptor verses the glucagon receptor. Thus, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide can be a glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist that has higher activity at the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-1 receptor, a glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist that has approximately equivalent activity at both receptors, or a glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist that has higher activity at the GLP-1 receptor versus the glucagon receptor. The latter category of co-agonist can be engineered to exhibit little or no activity at the glucagon receptor, and yet retain ability to activate the GLP-1 receptor with the same or better potency than native GLP-1. Any of these co-agonists may also include modifications that confer enhanced biophysical stability and/or aqueous solubility.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide can be made to produce a glucagon peptide having anywhere from at least about 10% (including at least about 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%) to about 200% or higher activity at the GLP-1 receptor relative to native GLP-1 and anywhere from at least about 10% (including about 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75%, 100%, 125%, 150%, 175%, 200%, 250%, 300%, 350%, 400%, 450%) to about 500% or higher activity at the glucagon receptor relative to native glucagon. The amino acid sequence of native glucagon is SEQ ID NO: 1, the amino acid sequence of GLP-1(7-36)amide is SEQ ID NO: 52, and the amino acid sequence of GLP-1(7-37)acid is SEQ ID NO: 50. In exemplary embodiments, a \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide may exhibit at least 10% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least 50% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, or at least 40% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least 40% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, or at least 60% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least 60% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelectivity of a \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide for the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-1 receptor can be described as the relative ratio of glucagon/GLP-1 activity (the peptide's activity at the glucagon receptor relative to native glucagon, divided by the peptide's activity at the GLP-1 receptor relative to native GLP-1). For example, a \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide that exhibits 60% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and 60% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor has a 1:1 ratio of glucagon/GLP-1 activity. Exemplary ratios of glucagon/GLP-1 activity include about 1:1, 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1 or 10:1, or about 1:10, 1:9, 1:8, 1:7, 1:6, 1:5, 1:4, 1:3, 1:2, or 1:1.5. As an example, a glucagon/GLP-1 activity ratio of 10:1 indicates a 10-fold selectivity for the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-1 receptor. Similarly, a GLP-1/glucagon activity ratio of 10:1 indicates a 10-fold selectivity for the GLP-1 receptor versus the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptides have about 10% or less of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, e.g. about 1-10%, or about 0.1-10%, or greater than about 0.1% but less than about 10%, while exhibiting at least 20% of the activity of GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor. For example, \nexemplary Class\n 3 glucagon related analog peptides described herein have about 0.5%, about 1% or about 7% of the activity of native glucagon, while exhibiting at least 20% of the activity of GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide can be a glucagon peptide with increased or decreased activity at the glucagon receptor, or GLP-1 receptor, or both. The \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide can be a glucagon peptide with altered selectivity for the glucagon receptor versus the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, as disclosed herein \nhigh potency Class\n 3 glucagon related analog peptides are provided that also exhibit improved solubility and/or stability. An exemplary high potency Class 3 glucagon related analog peptide exhibits at least about 200% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor, and optionally is soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8, or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide (e.g. 5% or less of the original peptide is degraded or cleaved) after 24 hours at 25° C. As another example, an exemplary Class 3 glucagon related analog peptide exhibits greater than about 40% or greater than about 60% activity at both the glucagon and the GLP-1 receptors (at a ratio between about 1:3 and 3:1, or between about 1:2 and 2:1), is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. Another exemplary Class 3 glucagon related analog peptide exhibits about 175% or more of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and about 20% or less of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. Yet another exemplary Class 3 glucagon related analog peptide exhibits about 10% or less of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least about 20% of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. Yet another exemplary Class 3 glucagon related analog peptide exhibits about 10% or less but above 0.1% , 0.5% or 1% of the activity of native glucagon at the glucagon receptor and at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 100% or more of the activity of native GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor, is optionally soluble at a concentration of at least 1 mg/mL at a pH between 6 and 8 or between 6 and 9, or between 7 and 9 (e.g. pH 7), and optionally retains at least 95% of the original peptide after 24 hours at 25° C. In some embodiments, such Class 3 glucagon related analog peptides retain at least 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 or 28 of the naturally occurring amino acids at the corresponding positions in native glucagon (e.g. have 1-7, 1-5 or 1-3 modifications relative to naturally occurring glucagon).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications Affecting Glucagon Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the glucagon receptor is provided by an amino acid modification at position 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1). In one embodiment, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide is a glucagon agonist that has been modified relative to the wild type peptide of His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Ser-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr (SEQ ID NO: 1) to enhance the peptide's potency at the glucagon receptor. The normally occurring serine at position 16 of native glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1) can be substituted with select acidic amino acids to enhance the potency of glucagon, in terms of its ability to stimulate cAMP synthesis in a validated in vitro model assay (see Example 2). More particularly, this substitution enhances the potency of the analog at least 2-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, and up to 10-fold greater at the glucagon receptor. This substitution also enhances the analog's activity at the GLP-1 receptor at least 5-fold, 10-fold, or 15-fold relative to native glucagon, but selectivity is maintained for the glucagon receptor over the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBy way of nonlimiting example, such enhanced potency can be provided by substituting the naturally occurring serine at position 16 with glutamic acid or with another negatively charged amino acid having a side chain with a length of 4 atoms, or alternatively with any one of glutamine, homoglutamic acid, or homocysteic acid, or a charged amino acid having a side chain containing at least one heteroatom, (e.g. N, O, S, P) and with a side chain length of about 4 (or 3-5) atoms. In accordance with one embodiment, the serine residue at position 16 of native glucagon is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid, glutamine, homoglutamic acid, homocysteic acid, threonine, or glycine. In accordance with one embodiment, the serine residue at position 16 of native glucagon is substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of glutamic acid, glutamine, homoglutamic acid and homocysteic acid, and in one embodiment the serine residue is substituted with glutamic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the enhanced \npotency Class\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide comprises a peptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7 or a glucagon agonist analog of SEQ ID NO: 5. In accordance with one embodiment, a \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide having enhanced potency at the glucagon receptor relative to wild type glucagon is provided wherein the peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10, wherein the glucagon peptide retains its selectivity for the glucagon receptor relative to the GLP-1 receptors. In one embodiment, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide having enhanced specificity for the glucagon receptor comprises the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 10 or a glucagon agonist analog thereof, wherein the carboxy terminal amino acid retains its native carboxylic acid group. In accordance with one embodiment, a \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide comprises the sequence of NH\n2\n-His-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Glu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Gln-Asp-Phe-Val-Gln-Trp-Leu-Met-Asn-Thr-COOH (SEQ ID NO: 10), wherein the peptide exhibits approximately fivefold enhanced potency at the glucagon receptor, relative to native glucagon as measured by the in vitro cAMP assay of Example 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReduced activity at the glucagon receptor is provided, e.g., by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 3. Substitution at this position with an acidic, basic, or a hydrophobic amino acid (glutamic acid, ornithine, norleucine) has been shown to substantially reduce or destroy glucagon receptor activity. In particular, any of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptides, including glucagon analogs, glucagon agonist analogs, glucagon co-agonists, and glucagon/GLP-1 co-agonist molecules, described herein may be modified to contain a modification at \nposition\n 3, e.g., Gln substituted with Glu, to produce a peptide with high selectivity, e.g., tenfold selectivity, for the GLP-1 receptor as compared to the selectivity for the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was observed that modifications at position 2 (e.g. AIB at position 2) and in some cases modifications at \nposition\n 1 may reduce glucagon activity. This reduction in glucagon activity can be restored by stabilizing the alpha-helix in the C-terminal portion of glucagon, e.g. through means described herein, for example, through a covalent bond between amino acids at positions “i” and “i+4”, e.g., 12 and 16, 16 and 20, or 20 and 24. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is a lactam bridge between a glutamic acid at position 16 and a lysine at \nposition\n 20. In some embodiments, this covalent bond is an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur-containing bridge formation, the use of α,ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications Affecting GLP-1 Activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by replacing the carboxylic acid of the C-terminal amino acid with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester. In one embodiment, these \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptides comprise a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20, wherein the carboxy terminal amino acid has an amide group in place of the carboxylic acid group found on the native amino acid. These \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptides have strong activity at both the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors and thus act as co-agonists at both receptors. In accordance with one embodiment, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide is a glucagon and GLP-1 receptor co-agonist, wherein the peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20, wherein the amino acid at \nposition\n 28 is Asn or Lys and the amino acid at \nposition\n 29 is Thr-amide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is provided by modifications that stabilize the alpha helix in the C-terminal portion of glucagon (e.g. around residues 12-29).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, such modifications permit formation of an intramolecular bridge between the side chains of two amino acids that are separated by three intervening amino acids (i.e., an amino acid at position “i” and an amino acid at position “i+4”, wherein i is any integer between 12 and 25), by two intervening amino acids, i.e., an amino acid at position “j” and an amino acid at position “j+3,” wherein j is any integer between 12 and 27, or by six intervening amino acids, i.e., an amino acid at position “k” and an amino acid at position “k+7,” wherein k is any integer between 12 and 22. In exemplary embodiments, the bridge or linker is about 8 (or about 7-9) atoms in length and forms between side chains of amino acids at \npositions\n 12 and 16, or at \npositions\n 16 and 20, or at \n \npositions\n \n 20 and 24, or at \n \npositions\n \n 24 and 28. The two amino acid side chains can be linked to one another through hydrogen-bonding, ionic interactions, such as the formation of salt bridges, or by covalent bonds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide exhibits glucagon/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist activity andcomprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11, 47, 48 and 49. In one embodiment, the side chains are covalently bound to one another, and in one embodiment the two amino acids are bound to one another to form a lactam ring.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide comprises SEQ ID NO: 45, wherein at least one lactam ring is formed between the side chains of an amino acid pair selected from the group consisting of amino acid pairs 12 and 16, 16 and 20 , 20 and 24 or 24 and 28. In one embodiment, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide comprises a glucagon peptide analog of SEQ ID NO: 20, wherein the peptide comprises an intramolecular lactam bridge formed between amino acid positions 12 and 16 or between amino acid positions 16 and 20. In one embodiment, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 20, wherein an intramolecular lactam bridge is formed between amino acid positions 12 and 16, between amino acid positions 16 and 20, or between amino acid positions 20 and 24 and the amino acid at \nposition\n 29 is glycine, wherein the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 29 is linked to the C-terminal amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 20. In a further embodiment, the amino acid at \nposition\n 28 is aspartic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some specific embodiments, stabilization of the alpha helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide is achieved through the formation of an intramolecular bridge other than a lactam bridge. For example, suitable covalent bonding methods include any one or more of olefin metathesis, lanthionine-based cyclization, disulfide bridge or modified sulfur-containing bridge formation, the use of α,ω-diaminoalkane tethers, the formation of metal-atom bridges, and other means of peptide cyclization are used to stabilize the alpha helix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, enhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor may be achieved by stabilizing the alpha-helix structure in the C-terminal portion of the glucagon peptide (around amino acids 12-29) through introduction of one or more α,α-disubstituted amino acids at positions that retain the desired activity. In some aspects, stabilization of the alpha-helix is accomplished in this manner without introduction of an intramolecular bridge such as a salt bridge or covalent bond. In some embodiments, one, two, three, four or more of \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24 or 29 of a glucagon peptide is substituted with an α,α-disubstituted amino acid. For example, substitution of position 16 of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide with amino iso-butyric acid (AIB) enhances GLP-1 activity, in the absence of a salt bridge or lactam. In some embodiments, one, two, three or more of \n \npositions\n \n 16, 20, 21 or 24 are substituted with AIB.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEnhanced activity at the GLP-1 receptor may be achieved by an amino acid modification at \nposition\n 20. In one embodiment, the glutamine at \nposition\n 20 is replaced with another hydrophilic amino acid having a side chain that is either charged or has an ability to hydrogen-bond, and is at least about 5 (or about 4-6) atoms in length, for example, lysine, citrulline, arginine, or ornithine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIncreased activity at the GLP-1 receptor is demonstrated in \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptides comprising the C-terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 26. GLP-1 activity in \nsuch Class\n 3 glucagon related analog peptides comprising SEQ ID NO: 26 can be further increased by modifying the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 18, 28 or 29, or at \nposition\n 18 and 29, as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA further modest increase in GLP-1 potency may be achieved by modifying the amino acid at \nposition\n 10 to be Trp.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombinations of the modifications that increase GLP-1 receptor activity generally provide higher GLP-1 activity than any of such modifications taken alone. For example, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptides can comprise modifications at position 16, at \nposition\n 20, and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20; can comprise modifications at position 16 and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group; can comprise modifications at \npositions\n 16 and 20, optionally with a covalent bond between the amino acids at \npositions\n 16 and 20; or can comprise modifications at \nposition\n 20 and at the C-terminal carboxylic acid group; optionally with the proviso that the amino acid at \nposition\n 12 is not Arg; or optionally with the proviso that the amino acid at \nposition\n 9 is not Glu.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModifications Affecting Solubility\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAddition of Hydrophilic Moieties\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptides can be further modified to improve the peptide's solubility and stability in aqueous solutions at physiological pH, while retaining the high biological activity relative to native glucagon. Hydrophilic moieties as discussed herein can be attached to the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide as further discussed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, introduction of hydrophilic groups at \npositions\n 17, 21, and 24 of the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide comprising SEQ ID NO: 9 or SEQ ID NO: 10 are anticipated to improve the solubility and stability of the high potency glucagon analog in solutions having a physiological pH. Introduction of such groups also increases duration of action, e.g. as measured by a prolonged half-life in circulation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide comprises a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18 and SEQ ID NO: 19, wherein the side chain of an amino acid residue at one of \nposition\n 16, 17, 21 or 24 of said \nClass\n 3 glucagon related analog peptide further comprises a polyethylene glycol chain, having a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 40,000 Daltons. In one embodiment, the polyethylene glycol chain has a molecular weight selected from the range of about 500 to about 5,000 Daltons.

In certain aspects a \nClass\n 4 peptide is provided which has glucagon antagonist activity. A glucagon antagonists would be used in any setting where the suppression of glucagon agonism is desired. The most immediate and obvious use would be in the treatment of diabetes where glucagon antagonism has been demonstrated in pre-clinical models of hyperglycemia to yield a lowering of blood glucose. Glucagon antagonists can be further modified to improve the biophysical stability and/or aqueous solubility of the compounds while maintaining the antagonist activity of the parent compound. In certain aspects a \nClass\n 4 peptide is defined as a pure glucagon antagonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “glucagon antagonist” refers to a compound that counteracts glucagon activity or prevents glucagon function. For example, a glucagon antagonist exhibits at least 60% inhibition (e.g., at least 70% inhibition) and preferably, at least 80% inhibition, of the maximum response achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In one embodiment, the glucagon antagonist exhibits at least 90% inhibition of the maximum response achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In a specific embodiment, the glucagon antagonist exhibits 100% inhibition of the maximum response achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor. Additionally, a glucagon antagonist at a concentration of about 1 μM exhibits less than about 20% of the maximum agonist activity achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In one embodiment, the glucagon antagonist exhibits less than about 10% of the maximum agonist activity achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In a specific embodiment, the glucagon antagonist exhibits less than about 5% of the maximum agonist activity achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor. In yet another specific embodiment, the glucagon antagonist exhibits 0% of the maximum agonist activity achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA “pure glucagon antagonist” is a glucagon antagonist that does not produce any detected stimulation of glucagon or GLP-1 receptor activity, as measured by cAMP production using a validated in vitro model assay (see, e.g., PCT/US2008/080973). For example, a pure glucagon antagonist exhibits less than about 5% (e.g., less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less than about 2%, less than about 1%, about 0%) of the maximum agonist activity achieved by glucagon at the glucagon receptor and exhibits less than about 5% (e.g., less than about 4%, less than about 3%, less than about 2%, less than about 1%, and about 0%) of the maximum agonist activity achieved by GLP-1 at the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, in some aspects, there is provided \nClass\n 4 peptides that exhibit pure glucagon antagonist activity. In accordance with one embodiment the glucagon antagonist exhibits activity that reduces glucagon receptor glucagon-induced cAMP production by a maximum of at least 50% when the glucagon receptor is contacted simultaneously with 0.8 nM of glucagon and the glucagon antagonist, as measured by cAMP production in an in vitro assay. In one embodiment, the glucagon antagonist reduces glucagon receptor glucagon-induced cAMP production by a maximum amount of at least 80%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nClass\n 4 peptides are believed to be suitable for any use that has previously been described for glucagon antagonists.

In accordance with one embodiment the patient to be treated using the \nClass\n 4 peptides disclosed herein is a domesticated animal, and in another embodiment the patient to be treated is a human. Studies suggest that lack of glucagon suppression in diabetic patients contributes to postprandial hyperglycemia in part via accelerated glycogenolysis. Analysis of blood glucose during an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), and in the presence or absence of somatostatin-induced glucagon suppression, has shown a significant increase in glucose in subjects with higher glucagon levels.

Accordingly the present disclosure also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more of the \nClass\n 4 peptides disclosed herein in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise the \nClass\n 4 peptides as the sole pharmaceutically active component, or the \nClass\n 4 peptides can be combined with one or more additional active agents.

More particularly, deletion of the first amino acid (des-His) and substitution of the aspartic acid at \nposition\n 9 with glutamic acid, in some aspects, produces a \nClass\n 4 peptide. \nClass\n 4 glucagon related analog peptides having sulfonic acid substituents substituted at amino acid position nine of glucagon perform similarly to the carboxylic acid-based amino acids but with a few critical differences in relation to physical properties such as solubility. Homocysteic acid (hCysSO\n3\n) when substituted for the isosteric glutamic acid at position nine in the conventional des-His, \nGlu9 Class\n 4 peptide retains a partial antagonist and weak agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment there is provided a Class 4 peptide wherein the first two to five amino acids are removed, and position 9 (according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 901) is replaced with hCys(SO\n3\n), homoglutamic acid, β-homoglutamic acid, or an alkylcarboxylate derivative of cysteine having the structure of:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein X\n5 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkenyl, or C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkynyl, provides a compound that performs as a hormonal antagonist that is highly specific, potent and without contaminating agonist properties.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment a Class 4 peptide is provided that comprises a glucagon peptide modified, relative to the wild type sequence of SEQ ID NO: 901, by the deletion of two to five amino acid residues from the N-terminus and substitution of the aspartic acid residue at position nine of the native protein with a glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, β-homoglutamic acid, a sulfonic acid derivative of cysteine, or an alkylcarboxylate derivative of cysteine having the structure of:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein X\n5 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkenyl, or C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkynyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific embodiment, the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprising the deletion of two to five amino acid residues from the N-terminus and substitution of the Asp at \nposition\n 9 of the native glucagon, is further modified by up to three amino acid modifications.

Alternatively or additionally, the \nClass\n 4 peptide may comprise one or more amino acid modifications selected from the group consisting of:\n\n \n \n \n \n \nA. substitution of one or two amino acids at \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 10, 20, and 24, (according to the amino acid numbering of SEQ ID NO: 901), or the N- or C-terminal amino acid of the \nClass\n 4 peptide with an amino acid covalently attached to an acyl group or alkyl group via an ester, ether, thioether, amide, or alkyl amine linkage;\n \nB. substitution of one or two amino acids at \npositions\n 16, 17, 20, 21, and 24 (according to the amino acid numbering of SEQ ID NO: 901), or the N- or C-terminal amino acid of the \nClass\n 4 peptide with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of: Cys, Lys, ornithine, homocysteine, and acetyl-phenylalanine (Ac-Phe), wherein the amino acid of the group is covalently bonded to a hydrophilic moiety;\n \nC. addition of an amino acid covalently bonded to a hydrophilic moiety to the N- or C-terminus of the \nClass\n 4 peptide;\n \nD. substitutution of Asp at position 15 (according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 901) with cysteic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, and homocysteic acid;\n \nE. substitution of Ser at position 16 (according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 901) with cysteic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, and homocysteic acid;\n \nF. substitution with AIB at one or more of \n \npositions\n \n 16, 20, 21, and 24 according to the amino acid numbering of SEQ ID NO: 901;\n \nG. deletion of the amino acid at \nposition\n 29 or the amino acids at \n \npositions\n \n 28 and 29, according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 901;\n \nH. substitution of each or both of the Asn at \nposition\n 28 and the Thr at position 29 (according to the amino acid numbering of SEQ ID NO: 901) with charged amino acids; and/or addition of one to two charged amino acids at the C-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 901;\n \nI. substitution of the Met at position 27 (according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 901) with Leu or norleucine;\n \nJ. addition of a peptide having the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 919-921 and 953 to the C-terminus of SEQ ID NO: 901; wherein Thr at position 29 (according to the numbering of SEQ ID NO: 901) is Thr or Gly; and\n \nK. replacement of the C-terminal carboxylate with an amide or ester.\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises an amino acid modification of A, B, or C, as described above, or a combination thereof. In yet another specific embodiment, the \nClass\n 4 peptide further comprises an amino acid modification of any of D to K as described above, or a combination thereof, in addition to the amino acid modification(s) of A, B, and/or C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises a glucagon peptide, wherein the first 5 amino acids have been removed from the N-terminus, and the remaining N-terminal amino group has been replaced with a hydroxyl group (the “PLA6 analog”), producing the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 939. Applicants have found that substitution of phenyl-lactic acid for phenylalanine in \nClass\n 4 peptide analogs that have the first five amino acids deleted and substitution of a glutamic acid at position 9 (relative to native glucagon) further enhances the potency of those \nClass\n 4 peptide analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the Class 4 peptide peptide of SEQ ID NO: 939 is further modified by substituting the aspartic acid residue at position four (position 9 of the native glucagon) with an amino acid of the general structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwherein X\n6 \nis C\n1\n-C\n3 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n3 \nalkene or C\n2\n-C\n3 \nalkynyl, and in one embodiment X\n6 \nis C\n1\n-C\n3 \nalkyl, and in another embodiment X\n6 \nis C\n2 \nalkyl. In one embodiment the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises a glucagon peptide, wherein the first 5 amino acids have been removed from the N-terminus, and the aspartic acid residue at position four (\nposition\n 9 of the native glucagon) has been substituted with cysteic acid or homocysteic acid. In one embodiment the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises a glucagon peptide comprising an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 939, SEQ ID NO: 907 and SEQ ID NO: 908. In one embodiment the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises an amino acid sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 908, wherein the amino acid at position four is homocysteic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the Class 4 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 939 is further modified by substituting the aspartic acid residue at position four (position 9 of the native glucagon) with glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid, β-homoglutamic acid, or an alkylcarboxylate derivative of cysteine having the structure of:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein X\n5 \nis C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl, C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkenyl, or C\n2\n-C\n4 \nalkynyl. In a specific embodiment, X\n5 \nis C\n1 \nor C\n2 \nalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, applicants have discovered that with the substitution of the N-terminal phenylalanine with PLA in a des1-5 glucagon analog (i.e., a glucagon analog having the first five amino acids deleted), further substitution of the native aspartic acid residue at position four (\nposition\n 9 of the native glucagon) is not required to produce an analog that exhibits pure antagonism. This result is surprising in light of the prior art teachings that the native aspartic acid residue at position four must substituted to produce high affinity and potent antagonists of glucagon (2-29) analogs. The use of the PLA substitution improves the relative potency of the Asp9 analog to a point comparable to that of the Glu9 and hCys(SO\n3\nH)9 analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstitution of the phenylalanine residue with other phenylalanine analogs, including 3,4-2F-phenylalnine (3,4-2F-Phe), 2-naphthyalanine (2-Nal), N-acyl-phenylalanine (Ac-Phe), alpha-methylhydrocinnamic acid (MCA) and benzylmalonic acid (BMA) did not perform as potently as the PLA substitution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubstituting PLA at sites other than at position six (according to the amino acid numbering of native glucagon), including at \n \npositions\n \n 4 and 5 reveals that the PLA6 analog is an appreciably more potent antagonist than glucagon analogs having a slightly extended N-terminus. The present invention also includes analogs wherein the N-terminal amino group is substituted with an acylated and alkylated “O-terminal” peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the PLA6 substitution not only increases the potency of the antagonist but also serves a critical role in pegylation. The PLA6 analogs can be selectively pegylated without restoration of glucagon agonism. In the absence of the PLA substitution, pegylation of the analog surprisingly induces glucagon agonism.

As used herein “oxy derivative of PLA” refers to a compound comprising a modified structure of PLA in which the hydroxyl group has been replaced with O—R\n11\n, wherein R\n11 \nis a chemical moiety. In this regard, the oxy derivative of PLA can be, for example, an ester of PLA or an ether of PLA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of making oxy derivatives of PLA are known in the art. For example, when the oxy derivative is an ester of PLA, the ester may be formed by upon reaction of the hydroxyl of PLA with a carbonyl bearing a nucleophile. The nucleophile can be any suitable nucleophile, including, but not limited to an amine or hydroxyl. Accordingly, the ester of PLA can comprise the structure of Formula XI:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein R7 is an ester formed upon reaction of the hydroxyl of PLA with a carbonyl bearing a nucleophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe carbonyl bearing a nucleophile (which reacts with the hydroxyl of PLA to form an ester) can be, for example, a carboxylic acid, a carboxylic acid derivative, or an activated ester of a carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid derivative can be, but is not limited to, an acyl chloride, an acid anhydride, an amide, an ester, or a nitrile. The activated ester of a carboxylic acid can be, for example, N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), tosylate (Tos), a carbodiimide, or a hexafluorophosphate. In some embodiments, the carbodiimide is 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), or 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DICD).

For example, the hydroxyl group of PLA may be reacted with a halogenated alkyl or tosylated alkyl alcohol to form an ether bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGenerally, the chemical moiety of R\n11 \nis one which does not decrease the activity of the \nClass\n 4 peptide. In some embodiments, the chemical moiety enhances the activity, stability, and/or solubility of the \nClass\n 4 peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the chemical moiety bound to PLA via an oxygen-containing bond (e.g., via an ester or ether bond) is a polymer (e.g., a polyalkylene glycol), a carbohydrate, an amino acid, a peptide, or a lipid, e.g., a fatty acid or a steroid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the chemical moiety is an amino acid, which, optionally, is a part of a peptide, such that Formula XI is a depsipeptide. In this regard, PLA may be at a position other than the N-terminal amino acid residue of the \nClass\n 4 peptide, such that the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or more) amino acids N-terminal to the PLA residue. For example, the \nClass\n 4 peptide can comprise PLA at position n, wherein n is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 of the \nClass\n 4 peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acids N-terminal to the PLA residue may be synthetic or naturally-occurring. In a specific embodiment, the amino acids which are N-terminal PLA are naturally-occurring amino acids. In one embodiment, the amino acids which are N-terminal to PLA are the N-terminal amino acids of native glucagon. For example, the \nClass\n 4 peptide can comprise at the N-terminus the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 954-958, wherein PLA is linked to threonine via an ester bond:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-PLA\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 954\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer-Gln-Gly-Thr-PLA\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 955\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln-Gly-Thr-PLA\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 956\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly-Thr-PLA\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 957\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr-PLA\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 958\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative embodiment, one or more of the N-terminal amino acids may be substituted with an amino acid other than the amino acid of native glucagon. For example, when the \nClass\n 4 peptide comprises PLA as the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 5 or 6, the amino acid at \nposition\n 1 and/or \nposition\n 2 may be an amino acid which reduces susceptibility to cleavage by dipeptidyl peptidase IV.

In this regard, the \nClass\n 4 peptide described herein can, for example, consist essentially of or consist of amino acids 1-27, 1-28, 2-27, 2-28, 3-27, 3-28, 4-27, 4-28, 5-27, 5-28, 6-27, or 6-28 of the native glucagon peptide (SEQ ID NO: 901) with one or more modifications resulting in \nClass\n 4 peptideic activity as described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe presently disclosed \nClass\n 4 peptides also encompass amino acid substitutions at positions that are known not to be critical to the function of the glucagon peptide.

In one embodiment the charged amino acid is selected from the group consisting of lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid. More particularly, applicants have discovered that substituting the normally occurring amino acid at \ncorresponding position\n 28 and/or 29 relative to native glucagon with charged amino acids, and/or the addition of one to two charged amino acids at the carboxy terminus of the \nClass\n 4 peptide, enhances the solubility and stability of the \nClass\n 4 peptides in aqueous solutions at physiologically relevant pHs (i.e., a pH of about 6.5 to about 7.5).

In an alternative embodiment the \nClass\n 4 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 939 is modified by the substitution of the native amino acid at \ncorresponding position\n 29 relative to native glucagon with a positively charged amino acid (e.g., lysine, arginine or histidine) and optionally the addition of one or two positively charged amino acid (e.g., lysine, arginine or histidine) on the carboxy terminus of the peptide. In accordance with one embodiment a \nClass\n 4 peptide having improved solubility and stability is provided wherein the peptide comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n941 with the proviso that at least one amino acids at position, 23, or 24 of SEQ ID NO: 941 is substituted with an acidic amino acid, and/or an additional acidic amino acid is added at the carboxy terminus of SEQ ID NO: 941. In one embodiment the acidic amino acids are independently selected from the group consisting of Asp, Glu, cysteic acid and homocysteic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment a \nClass\n 4 peptide having improved solubility and stability is provided wherein the antagonist comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 941, SEQ ID NO: 942, SEQ ID NO: 943 or SEQ ID NO: 944, wherein at least one of the amino acids at \n \npositions\n \n 23 or 24 is substituted with a non-native amino acid residue (i.e. at least one amino acid present at \n \nposition\n \n 23 or 24 of the analog is an acidic amino acid different from the amino acid present at the corresponding position in SEQ ID NO: 907). In accordance with one embodiment a glucagon agonist is provided comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 941 or 942 with the proviso that when the amino acid at \nposition\n 23 is asparagine and the amino acid at \nposition\n 24 is threonine, the peptide further comprises one to two amino acids, independently selected from the group consisting of Lys, Arg, His, Asp or Glu, added to the carboxy terminus of the \nClass\n 4 peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment the solubility of the \nClass\n 4 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 942 can be improved by covalently linking a hydrophilic moiety to an amino acid residue at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 11, 12, 15, 16, 19 or 24, and in one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is linked to an amino acid at position 11, 16 or 19, and in a further embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is linked to amino acid 19. In one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is a plasma protein or the Fc portion of an immunoglobin, and in an alternative embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is a hydrophilic hydrocarbon chain. In one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is polyethylene glycol, having a molecular weight selected from the range of about 1,000 to about 5,000 Daltons.

For example, when maintained at 0.01N HCl at 37° C. for 2 weeks, more than 50% of the native glucagon may be cleaved into fragments. The two liberated cleavage peptides 1-15 and 16-29 are devoid of glucagon-like biological activity and thus represent a limitation on the aqueous pre-formulation of glucagon and its related analogs. The selective chemical substitution of the Asp at \nposition\n 15 of the native glucagon peptide with Glu has been observed to virtually eliminate chemical cleavage of the 15-16 peptide bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, it is expected that the \nClass\n 4 peptides of the present invention can be similarly modified to decrease their susceptibility to premature chemical cleavage in aqueous buffers. In accordance with one embodiment the \nClass\n 4 peptides described herein can be further modified to enhance their stability in aqueous solutions by replacing the native aspartic amino acid, located at \nposition\n 15 of the native glucagon peptide, with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of cysteic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid and homocysteic acid.

For example, glucagon antagonist activity in conjunction with GLP-1 stimulation can be used in the treatment of diabetes where glucagon antagonism has been demonstrated in pre-clinical models of hyperglycemia to yield a lowering of blood glucose and GLP-1 activity is associated with insulin production. Compounds demonstrating GLP-1 activity have also been known to be useful for treating obesity and preventing weight gain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \ncertain aspects class\n 5 peptides are believed to be suitable for any use that has previously been described for other glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists. These two activities have separately been shown to be highly desirable properties for the treatment of the metabolic syndrome, specifically diabetes and obesity. The glucagon antagonist activity is useful in any setting where the suppression of glucagon agonism is desired. The presence of GLP-1 agonism further suppresses the endogenous secretion of glucagon from the pancreas while stimulating insulin synthesis and secretion. The two pharmacological actions serve in a synergistic fashion to normalize metabolic abnormalities. Accordingly, the \nClass\n 5 peptides can be used to treat hyperglycemia, or treat other metabolic diseases that result from high blood levels of glucagon or high blood glucose levels. In accordance with one embodiment the patient to be treated using the glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists such as \nclass\n 5 peptides disclosed herein is a domesticated animal, and in another embodiment the patient to be treated is a human. Studies suggest that lack of glucagon suppression in diabetic patients contributes to postprandial hyperglycemia in part via accelerated glycogenolysis. Analysis of blood glucose during an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), and in the presence or absence of somatostatin-induced glucagon suppression has shown a significant increase in glucose in subjects with higher glucagon levels. Accordingly, a glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 agonists or \nClass\n 5 peptides described herein can be used to treating hyperglycemia, and are expected to be useful for treating a variety of types of diabetes including diabetes mellitus type I, diabetes mellitus type II, or gestational diabetes, either insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent, and reducing complications of diabetes including nephropathy, retinopathy and vascular disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuch methods for reducing appetite or promoting loss of body weight are expected to be useful in reducing body weight, preventing weight gain, or treating obesity of various causes, including drug-induced obesity, and reducing complications associated with obesity including vascular disease (coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, ischemia reperfusion, etc.), hypertension, onset of diabetes type II, hyperlipidemia and musculoskeletal diseases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical \ncompositions comprising class\n 5 peptides can be formulated and administered to patients using standard pharmaeuctically acceptable carriers and routes of administration known to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the present disclosure also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or \nmore class\n 5 peptides disclosed herein in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise the \nclass\n 5 peptides as the sole pharmaceutically active component, or the \nclass\n 5 peptides can be combined with one or more additional active agents.

As used herein “oxy derivative of PLA” refers to a compound comprising a modified structure of PLA in which the hydroxyl group has been replaced with O—R\n11\n, wherein R\n11 \nis a chemical moiety. In this regard, the oxy derivative of PLA can be, for example, an ester of PLA or an ether of PLA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of making oxy derivatives of PLA are known in the art. For example, when the oxy derivative is an ester of PLA, the ester may be formed by upon reaction of the hydroxyl of PLA with a carbonyl bearing a nucleophile. The nucleophile can be any suitable nucleophile, including, but not limited to an amine or hydroxyl. Accordingly, the ester of PLA can comprise the structure of Formula XI:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nwherein R7 is an ester formed upon reaction of the hydroxyl of PLA with a carbonyl bearing a nucleophile.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe carbonyl bearing a nucleophile (which reacts with the hydroxyl of PLA to form an ester) can be, for example, a carboxylic acid, a carboxylic acid derivative, or an activated ester of a carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid derivative can be, but is not limited to, an acyl chloride, an acid anhydride, an amide, an ester, or a nitrile. The activated ester of a carboxylic acid can be, for example, N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), tosylate (Tos), a carbodiimide, or a hexafluorophosphate. In some embodiments, the carbodiimide is 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), or 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DICD). In some embodiments, the hexafluorophosphate is selected from a group consisting of hexafluorophosphate benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyB OP), 2-(1H-7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU), and o-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-uronium-hexafluoro-phosphate (HBTU).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMethods of making ethers from reaction with a hydroxyl group (e.g., the hydroxyl of PLA) also are known in the art. For example, the hydroxyl group of PLA may be reacted with a halogenated alkyl or tosylated alkyl alcohol to form an ether bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the chemical moiety bound to PLA via an oxygen-containing bond (e.g., via an ester or ether bond) is a polymer (e.g., a polyalkylene glycol), a carbohydrate, an amino acid, a peptide, or a lipid, e.g., a fatty acid or a steroid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a specific embodiment, the chemical moiety is an amino acid, which, optionally, is a part of a peptide, such that Formula XI is a depsipeptide. In this regard, PLA may be at a position other than the N-terminal amino acid residue of the peptide, such that the peptide comprises one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or more) amino acids N-terminal to the PLA residue. For example, the peptide can comprise PLA at position n, wherein n is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 of the peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amino acids N-terminal to the PLA residue may be synthetic or naturally-occurring. In a specific embodiment, the amino acids which are N-terminal PLA are naturally-occurring amino acids. In one embodiment, the amino acids which are N-terminal to PLA are the N-terminal amino acids of native glucagon. For example, the peptide can comprise at the N-terminus the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1052-1056, wherein PLA is linked to threonine via an ester bond:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHis-Ser-Gln-Gly-Thr-PLA\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 1052\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSer-Gln-Gly-Thr-PLA\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 1053\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGln-Gly-Thr-PLA\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 1054\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGly-Thr-PLA\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 1055\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThr-PLA\n\n\nSEQ ID NO: 1056\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn an alternative embodiment, one or more of the N-terminal amino acids may be substituted with an amino acid other than the amino acid of native glucagon. For example, when the peptide comprises PLA as the amino acid at \n \nposition\n \n 5 or 6, the amino acid at \nposition\n 1 and/or \nposition\n 2 may be an amino acid which reduces susceptibility to cleavage by dipeptidyl peptidase IV. More particularly, in some embodiments, \nposition\n 1 of the peptide is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D-histidine, alpha, alpha-dimethyl imidiazole acetic acid (DMIA), N-methyl histidine, alpha-methyl histidine, imidazole acetic acid, desaminohistidine, hydroxyl-histidine, acetyl-histidine and homo-histidine. More particularly, in some embodiments, \nposition\n 2 of the antagonist/agonist peptide is an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D-serine, D-alanine, valine, glycine, N-methyl serine, N-methyl alanine, and aminoisobutyric acid (AIB). Also, for example, when the peptide comprises PLA as the amino acid at \n \n \nposition\n \n \n 4, 5, or 6, the amino acid at \nposition\n 3 of the peptide may be glutamic acid, as opposed to the native glutamine residue of native glucagon. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the peptide comprises at the N-terminus the amino acid sequence of any of SEQ ID NOs: 1057-1059.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith respect to the peptides comprising a compound of Formula XI, the polymer may be any polymer, provided that it can react with the hydroxyl group of PLA.

In accordance with one embodiment the aspartic acid residue at \nposition\n 10 of \nclass\n 5 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1005, SEQ ID NO: 1006, SEQ ID NO: 1007 or SEQ ID NO: 1008 can be substituted with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of cysteic acid, glutamic acid, homoglutamic acid and homocysteic acid, and in one embodiment the native aspartic acid at \nposition\n 10 of SEQ ID NO: 1005, SEQ ID NO: 1006, SEQ ID NO: 1007 or SEQ ID NO: 1008 is replaced with glutamic acid. In accordance with one embodiment a \nclass\n 5 peptide having improved stability in aqueous solutions is provided wherein the antagonist comprises a modified sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1009, wherein the modification comprises substitution of the Asp at \nposition\n 10 of SEQ ID NO: 1009 with Glu. In one embodiment a \nclass\n 5 peptide is provided comprising a sequence selected form the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1022, SEQ ID NO: 1023, SEQ ID NO: 1024 and SEQ ID NO: 1025. In one embodiment the \nclass\n 5 peptide is amidated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Asp-Ser sequence at position 15-16 of native glucagon has been identified as a uniquely unstable dipeptide that leads to premature chemical cleavage of the native hormone in aqueous buffers. For example, when maintained at 0.01N HCl at 37° C. for 2 weeks, more than 50% of the native glucagon may be cleaved into fragments. The two liberated cleavage peptides 1-15 and 16-29 are devoid of glucagon-like biological activity and thus represent a limitation on the aqueous pre-formulation of glucagon and its related analogs. The selective chemical substitution of the Asp at \nposition\n 15 of native glucagon with Glu has been observed to virtually eliminate chemical cleavage of the 15-16 peptide bond.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet further exemplary embodiments, any of the foregoing compounds can be further modified to improve stability by modifying the amino acid corresponding to position 15 or 16 of native glucagon, to reduce degradation of the peptide over time, especially in acidic or alkaline buffers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nModification to Enhance Solubility\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe \nclass\n 5 peptide can be further modified to improve the peptide's solubility in aqueous solutions at physiological pH, in certain aspects, while retaining the glucagon antagonist and GLP-1 agonist activity. Introduction of hydrophilic groups at positions corresponding to \n \n \npositions\n \n \n 12, 15, 16, 19 and 24 of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1005, or at \n \npositions\n \n 12, 16, 19 or 24 of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1006 can improve the solubility of the resulting peptides in solutions having a physiological pH, while retaining the parent compounds glucagon antagonist and GLP agonist activity. Therefore, in one embodiment the presently disclosed \nclass\n 5 peptide that are further modified to comprise one or more hydrophilic groups covalently linked to the side chains of amino acids corresponding to amino acid positions 12, 15, 16, 19 and 24 of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1005 or SEQ ID NO: 1006. In a further embodiment the side chains of amino acids corresponding to amino acid positions 16 and 19 of SEQ ID NO: 1005 or SEQ ID NO: 1006 are covalently bound to hydrophilic groups, and in one embodiment the hydrophilic group is polyethylene glycol (PEG).\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nClass\n 5 glucagon related analog peptides can be modified by introducing charge at its carboxy terminus to enhance the solubility of the peptide while retaining the agonist properties of the peptide. The enhanced solubility allows for the preparation and storage of glucagon solutions at near neutral pH. Formulating glucagon solutions at relatively neutral pHs (e.g. pH of about 6.0 to about 8.0) improves the long term stability of the \nClass\n 5 peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApplicants anticipate that \nclass\n 5 peptides disclosed herein can be similarly modified to enhance their solubility in aqueous solutions at relatively neutral pH (e.g. pH of about 6.0 to about 8.0), in some cases, while retaining a glucagon antagonist and GLP-1 activity. Accordingly, one embodiment is directed to a glucagon antagonist/GLP-1 of SEQ ID NO: 1005, SEQ ID NO: 1006, SEQ ID NO: 1007 or SEQ ID NO: 1008 that has been further modified relative to the native amino acids present at positions 6-29 of the wild type glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 1001) to add charge to the peptide by the substitution of native non-charged amino acids with charged amino acids, or the addition of charged amino acids to the carboxy terminus In accordance with one embodiment, one to three of the non-charged native amino acids of the \nclass\n 5 peptides disclosed herein are replaced with a charged amino acid. In one embodiment the charged amino acid is selected from the group consisting of lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid. More particularly, applicants have discovered that substituting the normally occurring amino acid corresponding to position 28 and/or 29 (relative to native glucagon) with charged amino acids, and/or the addition of one to two charged amino acids at the carboxy terminus of the peptide, enhances the solubility and stability of the \nClass\n 5 peptide in aqueous solutions at physiologically relevant pHs (i.e., a pH of about 6.5 to about 7.5). Accordingly such modifications of \nclass\n 5 peptides are anticipated to have a similar effect on the solubility in aqueous solutions, particularly at a pH ranging from about 5.5 to about 8.0, while retaining the parent peptide's biological activity\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment the \nclass\n 5 peptide of SEQ ID NO: 1005, SEQ ID NO: 1006, SEQ ID NO: 1007 or SEQ ID NO: 1008 is modified by the substitution of the native amino acid at \nposition\n 23 and/or 24 of those sequences with a negatively charged amino acid (e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid) and optionally the addition of a negatively charged amino acid (e.g., aspartic acid or glutamic acid) to the carboxy terminus of the peptide. In an alternative embodiment a \nclass\n 5 peptide comprising SEQ ID NO: 1005, SEQ ID NO: 1006, SEQ ID NO: 1007 or SEQ ID NO: 1008 is modified by the substitution of the native amino acid at \nposition\n 24 of SEQ ID NO: 1005, SEQ ID NO: 1006, SEQ ID NO: 1007 or SEQ ID NO: 1008 with a positively charged amino acid (e.g., lysine, arginine or histidine) and optionally the addition of one or two positively charged amino acid (e.g., lysine, arginine or histidine) on the carboxy terminus of the peptide. In accordance with one embodiment a \nclass\n 5 peptide having improved solubility and stability is provided wherein the analog comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1015 or SEQ ID NO: 1051 with the proviso that at least one amino acids at position, 23, or 24 of SEQ ID NO: 1015 or SEQ ID NO: 1051 is substituted with an acidic amino acid and/or an additional acidic amino acid added at the carboxy terminus of SEQ ID NO: 1015 or SEQ ID NO: 1051. In one embodiment the acidic amino acids are independently selected from the group consisting of Asp, Glu, cysteic acid and homocysteic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment a \nclass\n 5 peptide having improved solubility and stability is provided wherein the antagonist comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1016, SEQ ID NO: 1017, SEQ ID NO: 1018 or SEQ ID NO: 1019.

In one embodiment a \nclass\n 5 peptide is provided comprising the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1015 or SEQ ID NO: 1051 wherein \nposition\n 4 of SEQ ID NO: 1015 is aspartic acid and \nposition\n 10 of SEQ ID NO: 1015 is glutamic acid. In a further embodiment the C-terminal amino acid of SEQ ID NO: 1015 or SEQ ID NO: 1051 is modified to replace the native carboxylic acid group with a charge-neutral group, such as an amide or ester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nClass\n 5 Peptide Fusions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn a further embodiment, the carboxy terminal amino acid of the \nClass\n 5 peptide described herein is covalently bound to a second peptide comprising a sequence selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs: 1021, 1026, 1027, and 1050.

In some embodiments, the dipeptide is attached to an amino acid or hydroxyl acid which is part of the active site of the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the dipeptide is attached to the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein via an ester bond between the dipeptide and the first amino acid of the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein. In some aspects, the dipeptide is attached to the side chain of the first amino acid of the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein, whereas in other aspects, the dipeptide is attached to the alpha carbon of the first amino acid of the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein via an ester bond. In the latter instance, the first amino acid of the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein is an HO-amino acid. In more specific aspects, the first amino acid of the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein is HO-His, HO-Tyr, HO-Phe, or a derivative of HO-Phe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the dipeptide is attached to the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein via an ester bond between the dipeptide and the last amino acid of the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein. In some aspects, the dipeptide is attached to the side chain of the last amino acid of the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein, whereas in other aspects, the dipeptide is attached to the alpha carbon of the last amino acid of the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein via an ester bond. In the latter instance, the last amino acid of the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein is an amino alcohol in which the native alpha carboxylate group has been changed to an alcohol group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn alternative embodiments, the dipeptide is attached to an internal amino acid residue of the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein. In some embodiments, the internal amino acid is an amino acid comprising a side chain hydroxyl group, e.g., Ser, Thr.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, in which the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein is glucagon, the dipeptide is attached to \n \n \n \nposition\n \n \n \n 2, 5, 7, 8, or 11 of glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 612). In other embodiments, in which the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein is a glucagon superfamily peptide (e.g., glucagon related analog peptide), the dipeptide is attached to the position of the glucagon superfamily peptide which corresponds to \n \n \n \nposition\n \n \n \n 2, 5, 7, 8, or 11 of glucagon (SEQ ID NO: 612). The position of the glucagon superfamily peptide which corresponds to \n \n \n \nposition\n \n \n \n 2, 5, 7, 8, or 11 of glucagon can be determined by aligning the amino acid sequence the glucagon superfamily peptide with the amino acid sequence of native glucagon. For example, a number of glucagon superfamily peptide sequences are aligned with the glucagon sequence (SEQ ID NO: 612) in \nFIG. 18\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, in which the bioactive peptide is insulin, the dipeptide is attached to \nposition\n 4 or 21 of the A chain of insulin or to position 5 or 9 of the B chain of insulin. In another embodiment, wherein the bioactive peptide is insulin, the dipeptide is attached to the N- or C-terminal amino acid of the A or B chain of insulin.

If the activity level of the modified bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein is less than about 10% (e.g., less than about 5%, less than about 1%) of the activity level of the corresponding bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein, which does not comprise the dipeptide, then the Ser or Thr to which the dipeptide is attached is identified as a good position for attachment of the dipeptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlternatively, the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein can be modified to replace a native amino acid with a Ser or Thr and the modified bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein can be tested for activity. If the modified bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein demonstrates activity that is similar, the same as, or higher than the activity of the unmodified bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein, then the modified bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein can then be tested for activity as a prodrug comprising a dipeptide moiety attached to the Ser or Thr which replaced the native amino acid. If the activity level of the prodrug of the modified bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein is less than about 10% (e.g., less than about 5%, less than about 1%) of the activity level of the modified bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein, which does not comprise the dipeptide, then the Ser or Thr to which the dipeptide is attached is identified as a good position for attachment of the dipeptide.\n\n\n \nProdrug Dipeptide Moieties\n\n\n \n \n \nThe dipeptide of the prodrugs described herein is any combination of two covalently linked amino acids or covalently linked hydroxyl acid and amino acid which is capable of forming a diketopiperidine (DKP) or a diketomorpholine (DMP) in PBS under physiological conditions (e.g., in the absence of any enzymes or additional chemicals). The formation of the DKP or DMP results in cleavage of the ester bond between the dipeptide and the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein. The structure of the dipeptide governs the tendency for DKP or DMP formation, and thus governs the rate of cleavage of the dipeptide from the bioactive peptide, polypeptide, or protein.

In brief, the assay is a cellular based assay wherein a host cell is co-transfected with the GLP-1 receptor and luciferase gene linked to a cAMP responsive element (CRE). The transcription of the luciferase gene is regulated by the cAMP response-element binding protein (CREB) binding to cAMP response element. The cAMP production that is induced is directly proportional to the GLP-1 binding to its receptor which is indicated by the detected activity of the expressed luciferase gene. The prodrugs disclosed herein regained their potencies after incubation in PBS buffer at a pH of 7.2 and temperature of 37° C. Furthermore, the present GLP-1 analogs possess a minimal alteration to the native amino acid sequence, and this should minimize potential adverse immunogenic affects.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prodrugs disclosed herein can be further modified to improve the peptide's solubility in aqueous solutions at physiological pH, while enhancing the effective duration of the peptide by preventing renal clearance of the peptide. Peptides are easily cleared because of their relatively small molecular size when compared to plasma proteins. Increasing the molecular weight of a peptide above 40 kDa exceeds the renal threshold and significantly extends duration in the plasma. Accordingly, in one embodiment the peptide prodrugs are further modified to comprise a covalently linked hydrophilic moiety. In one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is a plasma protein polyethylene chain or the Fc portion of an immunoglobin. Therefore, in one embodiment the presently disclosed prodrugs are further modified to comprise one or more hydrophilic groups covalently linked to the side chains of amino acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment the insulin prodrugs disclosed herein are further modified by linking a hydrophilic moiety to either the N-terminal amino acid of the B chain or to the amino acid at \nposition\n 29 of SEQ ID NO: 627. In another embodiment the glucagon and GLP-1 prodrugs disclosed herein are further modified by linking a hydrophilic moiety to the amino acid corresponding to \n \npositions\n \n 20, 21, 24 of SEQ ID NO: 612 and SEQ ID NO: 602, respectively, or by the addition of a modified amino acid to the carboxy terminus of the glucagon or GLP-1 prodrug. The C-terminally added amino acid is modified to comprise a hydrophilic moiety to the amino acid. In one embodiment the glucagon and GLP-1 prodrugs disclosed herein are further modified by linking a hydrophilic moiety to the amino acid corresponding to position 24 of SEQ ID NO: 612 and SEQ ID NO: 602, respectively. In one embodiment the hydrophilic moiety is selected from the group consisting of a plasma protein polyethylene chain and an Fc portion of an immunoglobin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the hydrophilic group is a polyethylene chain, and in one embodiment two or more polyethylene chains are covalently attached to two or more amino acid side chains of the prodrug. For the glucagon or GLP-1 prodrugs multiple polyethylene chains can be attached at positions selected from the \n \ngroup\n \n 20, 21, 24, or by the addition of a single amino acid at the C-terminus of the peptide wherein the added amino acid has a polyethylene chain linked to its side chain. In one embodiment the amino acid added to the C-terminus is a modified cysteine.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, the prodrugs disclosed herein are further modified by amino acid substitutions, wherein the substituting amino acid comprises a side chain suitable for crosslinking with hydrophilic moieties, including for example, polyethylene glycol. In one embodiment the amino acid at the position of the prodrug where the hydrophilic moiety is to be linked substituted (or added at the C-terminus of the prodrug) with a natural or synthetic amino acid to introduce, or allow for ease in attaching, the hydrophilic moiety. For example, in one embodiment the native amino acid at \nposition\n 20, 21, 24 (of the glucagon or GLP-1 prodrugs) is substituted with a lysine or cysteine residue (or a lysine or cysteine residue is added to the C-terminus) to allow for the covalent attachment of a polyethylene chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment the prodrug has a single cysteine residue added to the carboxy terminus, or the prodrug peptide is substituted with at least one cysteine residue, wherein the side chain of the cysteine residue is further modified with a thiol reactive reagent, including for example, maleimido, vinyl sulfone, 2-pyridylthio, haloalkyl, and haloacyl. These thiol reactive reagents may contain carboxy, keto, hydroxyl, and ether groups as well as other hydrophilic moieties such as polyethylene glycol units. In an alternative embodiment, the prodrug has a single lysine residue added to the carboxy terminus, or the prodrug peptide is substituted with lysine, and the side chain of the substituting lysine residue is further modified using amine reactive reagents such as active esters (succinimido, anhydride, etc) of carboxylic acids or aldehydes of hydrophilic moieties such as polyethylene glycol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe presently disclosed glucagon and GLP-1 prodrugs encompass amino acid substitutions of the native glucagon and GLP-1 sequences at positions that are known not to be critical to the function of the GLP-1 analog. In one embodiment the substitutions are conservative amino acid substitutions at one, two, three, four, five or six positions selected from the group consisting of 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 12-14, 16-18, 24, 28 and 29. In one embodiment the amino acids corresponding to \n \npositions\n \n 20, 21 and 24 of the native GLP-1/glucagon peptide, and more particularly at \npositions\n 21 and 24 relative to native GLP-1/glucagon are substituted with cysteine or lysine, wherein a PEG chain is covalently attached to the substituted cysteine or lysine residue. In a further embodiment the C-terminus of the GLP-1 analog is modified to replace the carboxylic acid group with an amide group.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn those embodiments wherein the prodrug comprises a polyethylene glycol chain, the polyethylene chain may be in the form of a straight chain or it may be branched. In accordance with one embodiment the polyethylene glycol chain has an average molecular weight selected from the range of about 20,000 to about 60,000 Daltons. Multiple polyethylene chains can be linked to the prodrugs to provide a prodrug with optimal solubility and blood clearance properties. In one embodiment the prodrug is linked to a single polyethylene glycol chain that has an average molecular weight selected from the range of about 20,000 to about 60,000 Daltons. In another embodiment the prodrug is linked to a two polyethylene glycol chains wherein the combined average molecular weight of the two chains is selected from the range of about 40,000 to about 80,000 Daltons. In one embodiment a single polyethylene glycol chain having an average molecular weight of 20,000 or 60,000 Daltons is linked to the prodrug. In another embodiment a single polyethylene chain is linked to the prodrug and has an average molecular weight selected from the range of about 40,000 to about 50,000 Daltons. In one embodiment two polyethylene glycol chains are linked to the prodrug wherein the first and second polyethylene glycol chains each have an average molecular weight of 20,000 Daltons.

For example, serum albumin can be covalently bound to the glucagon or GLP-1 prodrug analog presented herein. In one embodiment the plasmid protein is covalently bound to an amino acid corresponding to position 20, 21 or 24 of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 604 or SEQ ID NO: 612. More particularly, in one embodiment the plasmid protein is bound to an amino acid corresponding to position 21 or 24 of the glucagon or GLP-1 prodrug analog.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn accordance with one embodiment, a glucagon or GLP-1 prodrug analog is provided wherein a linear amino acid sequence representing the Fc portion of an immunoglobin molecule has been covalently linked to an amino acid side chain of glucagon or GLP-1 prodrug analog disclosed herein to improve the solubility, stability and/or pharmacokinetics of the glucagon or GLP-1 prodrug analog. For example, the amino acid sequence representing the Fc portion of an immunoglobin molecule can be covalently bound to \n \nposition\n \n 20, 21 or 24 of the peptide of SEQ ID NO: 604 or glucagon or GLP-1 prodrug. More particularly, in one embodiment the Fc portion is bound to an amino acid corresponding to position 21 or 24 of the glucagon or GLP-1 prodrug analog, wherein the analog comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 604 or SEQ ID NO: 612.

Linkage can be accomplished by covalent chemical bonds, physical forces such electrostatic, hydrogen, ionic, van der Waals, or hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions. A variety of non-covalent coupling systems may be used, including biotin-avidin, ligand/receptor, enzyme/substrate, nucleic acid/nucleic acid binding protein, lipid/lipid binding protein, cellular adhesion molecule partners; or any binding partners or fragments thereof which have affinity for each other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary conjugates include but are not limited to a heterologous peptide or polypeptide (including for example, a plasma protein), a targeting agent, an immunoglobulin or portion thereof (e.g. variable region, CDR, or Fc region), a diagnostic label such as a radioisotope, fluorophore or enzymatic label, a polymer including water soluble polymers, or other therapeutic or diagnostic agents. In one embodiment a conjugate is provided comprising a prodrug polypeptide of the present invention and a plasma protein, wherein the plasma protein is selected form the group consisting of albumin, transferin and fibrinogen. In one embodiment the plasma protein moiety of the conjugate is albumin or transferin. In some embodiments, the linker comprises a chain of atoms from 1 to about 60, or 1 to 30 atoms or longer, 2 to 5 atoms, 2 to 10 atoms, 5 to 10 atoms, or 10 to 20 atoms long.

Exemplary linkers are from about 1 to 50 amino acids in length, 5 to 50, 3 to 5, 5 to 10, 5 to 15, or 10 to 30 amino acids in length. Such fusion proteins may alternatively be produced by recombinant genetic engineering methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApplicants have also discovered that native glucagon and GLP-1 can be modified by introducing charge at its carboxy terminus to enhance the solubility of the peptide while retaining the agonist properties of the peptide. The enhanced solubility allows for the preparation and storage of glucagon and GLP-1 solutions at near neutral pH. Formulating glucagon and GLP-1 solutions at relatively neutral pHs (e.g. pH of about 5.0 to about 7.0) improves the long term stability of the analogs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nApplicants anticipate that the glucagon and GLP-1 prodrugs disclosed herein can be similarly modified to enhance their solubility in aqueous solutions at relatively neutral pH (e.g. pH of about 5.0 to about 7.0) while retaining the activities of the parent protein. Accordingly, one embodiment of the present invention is directed to a glucagon or GLP-1 analog that has been further modified relative to the native amino acids to add charge to the peptide by the substitution of native non-charged amino acids with charged amino acids, or the addition of charged amino acids to the carboxy terminus. In accordance with one embodiment, one to three of the non-charged native amino acids of the glucagon or GLP-1 prodrug of the present disclosure are replaced with a charged amino acid. In one embodiment the charged amino acid is selected from the group consisting of lysine, arginine, histidine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid. More particularly, applicants have discovered that substituting the normally occurring amino acid corresponding to \npositions\n 28 or 29 (relative to SEQ ID NO: 612) for glucagon or positions 28 or 29 and 30 for GLP-1 (relative to SEQ ID NO: 602) with charged amino acids, and/or the addition of one to two charged amino acids at the carboxy terminus of the glucagon or GLP-1 prodrug, enhances the solubility and stability of the prodrugs in aqueous solutions at physiologically relevant pHs (i.e., a pH of about 6.0 to about 7.0). Such modifications of the glucagon and GLP-1 prodrugs disclosed herein are anticipated to have a similar effect on the solubility in aqueous solutions, particularly at a pH ranging from about 5.0 to about 7.0, while retaining the parent peptide's biological activity\n\n\n \nUse\n\n\n \n \n \nThe disclosed GLP-1, glucagon and insulin prodrugs are believed to be suitable for any use that has previously been described for those bioactive peptides. Accordingly, the prodrugs described herein can be used to treat hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or treat other metabolic diseases that result from high/low blood levels of glucagon or high/low blood glucose levels. In accordance with one embodiment the patient to be treated using the prodrug disclosed herein is a domesticated animal, and in another embodiment the patient to be treated is a human.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe method of treating hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia in accordance with the present invention comprises the steps of administering the presently disclosed prodrugs to a patient using any standard route of administration, including parenterally, such as intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously or intramuscularly, intrathecally, transdermally, rectally, orally, nasally or by inhalation. In one embodiment the composition is administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. In one embodiment, the composition is administered parenterally and the prodrug composition is prepackaged in a syringe.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExendin-4, is a peptide made up of 39 amino acids. Stimulators of the GLP-1 receptor have been reported to suppress appetite and induce weight loss. In one embodiment the terminal ten amino acids of Exendin-4 (i.e. the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 624 (GPSSGAPPPS)) are linked to the carboxy terminus of the glucagon and GLP-1 prodrugs of the present disclosure.

In accordance with one embodiment the patient is a domesticated animal, and in another embodiment the patient to be treated is a human. Such methods for reducing appetite or promoting loss of body weight are expected to be useful in reducing body weight, preventing weight gain, or treating obesity of various causes, including drug-induced obesity, and reducing complications associated with obesity including vascular disease (coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, ischemia reperfusion, etc.), hypertension, onset of diabetes type II, hyperlipidemia and musculoskeletal diseases. In one embodiment the administered peptide comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 605. While the present invention contemplates that glucagon and GLP-1 prodrugs described herein may optionally be joined to this 10 amino acid carboxy terminal extension (SEQ ID NO: 624), the invention specifically contemplates analogs lacking the 10 contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 624.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother compound that induces weight loss is oxyntomodulin, a naturally occurring digestive hormone found in the small intestine (see Diabetes 2005; 54:2390-2395). Oxyntomodulin is a 37 amino acid peptide that contains the 29 amino acid sequence of glucagon followed by an 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension of SEQ ID NO: 625 (KRNRNNIA). Accordingly, in one embodiment prodrug derivatives of glucagon and GLP-1 are provided that further comprise the carboxy terminal extension of the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 625. More particularly, in accordance with one embodiment a prodrug derivative of the present disclosure comprises a peptide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 602, SEQ ID NO: 612, SEQ ID NO: 622 or SEQ ID NO: 623, further comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 625 (KRNRNNIA) linked to the carboxy terminal sequence of SEQ ID NO: 602, SEQ ID NO: 612, SEQ ID NO: 622 or SEQ ID NO: 623. These peptide can be used to induce weight loss or prevent weight gain. While the present invention contemplates that glucagon and GLP-1 prodrugs described herein may optionally be joined to this 8 amino acid carboxy terminal extension (SEQ ID NO: 625), the invention specifically contemplates analogs lacking the 8 contiguous amino acids of SEQ ID NO: 625.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe glucagon and GLP-1 prodrugs of the present invention can also be administered to patients suffering from catabolic wasting. It is estimated that over half of cancer patients experience catabolic wasting which is characterized by unintended and progressive weight loss, weakness, and low body fat and muscle. The syndrome is equally common in AIDS patients and can also be present in bacterial and parasitic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic diseases of the bowel, liver, lungs, and heart. It is usually associated with anorexia and can manifest as a condition in aging or as a result of physical trauma. Catabolic wasting is a symptom that diminishes the quality of life, worsens the underlying condition, and is a major cause of death.\n\n\n \nCombinations\n\n\n \n \n \nThe insulin, glucagon and GLP-1 prodrugs of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic or anti-obesity agents.

Although certain non-natural amino acids cannot be expressed by standard recombinant DNA techniques, techniques for their preparation are known in the art. Compounds of this invention that encompass non-peptide portions may be synthesized by standard organic chemistry reactions, in addition to standard peptide chemistry reactions when applicable.\n\n\n \nExamples\n\n\n \n \n \nGeneral Pegylation Protocol: (Cys-Maleimido)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypically, the GLP Cys analog is dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (5-10 mg/ml) and 0.01M ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid is added (10-15% of total volume). Excess (2-fold) maleimido methoxyPEG reagent (Dow) is added and the reaction stirred at room temp while monitoring reaction progress by HPLC. After 8-24 hrs, the reaction mixture, is acidified and loaded onto a preparative reverse phase column for purification using 0.1% TFA/acetonitrile gradient. The appropriate fractions were combined and lyophilized to give the desired pegylated derivatives.\n\n\n \nExample 1 \n\n\nSynthesis of glucagon and GLP-1 analogs\n\n\n \n \n \nTo investigate the possibility of preparing prodrugs derivative of glucagon and GLP-1, numerous peptide analogs were synthesized. The standard procedure is described briefly here and in \nFIGS. 3 and 4\n, and the details are discussed later.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMaterials:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPAM resin (PAM resin is OCH\n2-\nphenylacetamidomethyl-copolystyrene-1% divinylbenzene), (100-180 mesh, 1% DVB cross-linked polystyrene; loading of 0.7-10 mmol/g), Boc-protected and Fmoc protected amino acids were purchased from Midwest Biotech. Other reagents such as the α-hydroxy-acids (phenyllactic acid and glycolic acid) were purchased from Aldrich. The solid phase peptide syntheses using Boc-protected amino acids were performed on an Applied Biosystem 430A Peptide Synthesizer. Fmoc protected amino acid synthesis was performed using the Applied Biosystems Model 433 Peptide Synthesizer. The manual synthesis of depsi-peptides was performed in sintered reaction vessels using analogous procedures (Schnolzer, M., et al., (1992) Int J Pept Protein Res 40(3-4):180-193).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide Synthesis (Boc Amino Acids/HF Cleavage):\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis of these analogs was performed on the Applied Biosystem Model 430A Peptide Synthesizer. Synthetic peptides were constructed by sequential addition of amino acids, and activated esters of each amino acid were generated by the addition of 1.9 mmol (3.8 ml of a 0.5M solution) of 3-(Diethoxy-phosphoryloxy)-3H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazin-4-one (DEPBT) in DMF to a cartridge containing 2 mmol of Boc protected amino acid. The amino acids were dissolved by bubbling Nitrogen gas through the cartridge. 1 ml of N,N-Diisopropylethylamine was added to the cartridge to effect ester formation. This solution was transferred to the reaction vessel containing the 0.2 mmol of the C-terminal residue attached to the PAM resin, vortexed several times, and allowed to couple to the resin for 10 minutes. After washing to remove the unreacted reagents, the N-terminal Boc protecting group was removed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for 5 minutes. The resin was washed with DMF and the cycle was repeated for the desired number of steps until the chain was assembled. The reaction vessel at the end of the synthesis (typically 30 amino acids) contained approximately 1.2-1.5 g of protected peptidyl-PAM resin. The resin was washed numerous times with dimethylformamide (DMF), treated with trifluoroacetic acid to remove the last tBoc protecting group and finally washed several additional times with DMF, dichloromethane (DCM) and dried.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptidyl-resin was treated with anhydrous HF (procedure detailed later in this section), and this typically yielded approximately 350 mg (˜50% yield) of a crude deprotected-peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptide Synthesis (Fmoc Amino Acids/HF Cleavage):\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis synthesis scheme was performed manually with a few amino acids at selective sites. In this work, the Fmoc amino acids were used only to synthesize the internal serine prodrugs, as a part of a wider synthetic strategy. Here, it is to be noted that although FMOC chemistry has been used in the synthesis, the peptides have always been built on PAM resin that required treatment with HF to cleave the peptide from the solid support. The yield of these peptides is approximately as stated earlier for Boc/PAM synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe synthesis was carried out as described in the previous section. At the end of the coupling step, the peptidyl-resin was treated with 20% piperidine to remove the N-terminal Fmoc protecting group. It was washed repeatedly with DMF and this repetitive cycle was repeated for the desired number of coupling steps. The peptidyl-resin at the end of the entire synthesis was dried by using DCM, and the peptide was cleaved from the resin with anhydrous HF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDepsi-Peptide Synthesis (Amino Ester Formation)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this case, the peptidyl-resin had an α-hydroxyl-N terminal extension instead of a N-terminal amine and the acylation was done at the α hydroxyl group. This reaction takes a longer time than that of the amide bond formation, as the hydroxyl group is a weaker nucleophile as compared to the amine. The reaction time was typically 12 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInitially, the activated esters of each amino acid were generated by the addition of 1 mmol (0.155 ml of Diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) to a cartridge containing a solution of 2 mmol of Boc protected amino acid residue in 2 ml DCM. This was cooled to 10° C. for 10 minutes 0.9 mmol (244 mg) of dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) was added to the cartridge to accelerate ester formation. This mixture was transferred to the reaction vessel containing the peptidyl-resin upon which the peptide was synthesized. The reaction vessel was stirred for 12 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptidyl-resin was dried using DCM and the synthesis of the desired peptide was continued. The peptidyl-resin at the end of the entire synthesis was dried by using DCM, and finally treated with anhydrous HF to generate the desired peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nN-Terminal Hydroxyl Peptide Synthesis (α Hydroxyl-N Terminal Extension)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn this reaction, the free amine of the peptidyl-resin reacts with an a hydroxyl acid to form an α hydroxyl-N terminal extension. In this regard, only two such a hydroxyl acids were used namely, glycolic acid (OH-glycine) and phenyllactic acid (OH-phenylalanine). These syntheses were also performed manually. The peptides were constructed by addition of the a hydroxyl acid, and activated esters of the a hydroxyl acid were generated by the addition of 0.9 mmol of DEPBT (270 mg) to a cartridge containing a solution of 1 mmol of Boc protected residue in 2 ml DMF. 0.5 ml of DIEA (N,N-Diisopropylethylamine) was added to the cartridge to accelerate ester formation. This mixture was transferred to the reaction vessel containing the peptidyl-resin upon which the peptide was synthesized. The reaction time was 6 hours.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptidyl-resin was dried using DCM and the synthesis of the desired peptide was continued. The peptidyl-resin at the end of the entire synthesis was dried by using DCM, and cleaved by anhydrous HF to generate the free peptide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHF Treatment of the Peptidyl-Resin\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe peptidyl-resin (30 mg to 200 mg) was placed in the hydrogen fluoride (HF) reaction vessel for cleavage. 5004, of p-cresol was added to the vessel as a carbonium ion scavenger. The vessel was attached to the HF system and submerged in the methanol/dry ice mixture. The vessel was evacuated with a vacuum pump and 10 ml of HF was distilled to the reaction vessel. This reaction mixture of the peptidyl-resin and the HF was stirred for one hour at 0° C., after which a vacuum was established and the HF was quickly evacuated (10-15 min) The vessel was removed carefully and filled with approximately 35 ml of ether to precipitate the peptide and to extract the p-cresol and small molecule organic protecting groups resulting from HF treatment. This mixture was filtered utilizing a teflon filter and repeated twice to remove all excess cresol. This filtrate was discarded. The precipitated peptide dissolves in approximately 20 ml of 10% acetic acid (aq). This filtrate, which contained the desired peptide, was collected and lyophilized.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalysis Using Mass Spectrometry\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe mass spectra were obtained using a Sciex API-III electrospray quadrapole mass spectrometer with a standard ESI ion source. Ionization conditions that were used are as follows: ESI in the positive-ion mode; ion spray voltage, 3.9 kV; orifice potential, 60 V. The nebulizing and curtain gas used was nitrogen flow rate of 0.9 L/min Mass spectra were recorded from 600-1800 Thompsons at 0.5 Th per step and 2 msec dwell time. The sample (about 1 mg/mL) was dissolved in 50% aqueous acetonitrile with 1% acetic acid and introduced by an external syringe pump at the rate of 5 μL/min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen the peptides were analyzed in PBS solution by ESI MS, they were first desalted using a ZipTip solid phase extraction tip containing 0.6 μL C4 resin, according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Mass., see http://www.millipore.com/catalogue.nsf/docs/C5737).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHigh Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analysis:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreliminary analyses were performed with these crude peptides to get an approximation of their relative conversion rates in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) buffer (pH, 7.2) using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and MALDI analysis. The crude peptide samples were dissolved in the PBS buffer at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. 1 ml of the resulting solution was stored in a 1.5 ml HPLC vial which was then sealed and incubated at 37° C. Aliquots of 100 μl were drawn out at various time intervals, cooled to room temperature and analyzed by HPLC.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HPLC analyses were performed using a Beckman System Gold\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChromatography system using a UV detector at 214 nm. HPLC analyses were performed on a 150 mm×4.6 mm C18 Vydac column The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Solvent A contained 0.1% TFA in distilled water, and solvent B contained 0.1% TFA in 90% CH\n3\nCN. A linear gradient was employed (40% to 70% B in 15 minutes). The data were collected and analyzed using Peak Simple Chromatography software.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe initial rates of hydrolysis were used to measure the rate constant for the dissociation of the respective prodrugs. The concentrations of the prodrug and the drug were estimated from their peak areas respectively. The first order dissociation rate constants of the prodrugs were determined by plotting the logarithm of the concentration of the prodrug at various time intervals. The slope of this plot gives the rate constant ‘k’. The half lives of the degradation of the various prodrugs were then calculated by using the formula t\n1/2\n=0.693/k.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreparative Purification Using HPLC:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOnce a prodrug displaying an appropriate t\n1/2 \nwas identified, the prodrug was purified. The purification was performed using HPLC analysis on a silica based 1×25 cm Vydac C18 (5μ particle size, 300 Å pore size) column The instruments used were: Waters Associates model 600 pump, Injector model 717, and UV detector model 486. A wavelength of 214 nm was used for all samples. Solvent A contained 10% CH\n3\nCN/0.1% TFA in distilled water, and solvent B contained 0.1% TFA in CH\n3\nCN. A linear gradient was employed (0 to 100% B in 2 hours). The flow rate is 1.2 ml/min and the fraction size was 6 ml. From ˜350 mgs of crude peptide, 80 mgs of the pure peptide (˜23% yield) was typically obtained.\n\n\n \nExample 2 \n\n\n \n \n \nBioassay Experimental Design: Luciferase-Based Reporter Gene Assay for cAMP Detection\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ability of each glucagon and GLP-1 analog or prodrug to induce cAMP was measured in a firefly luciferase-based reporter assay. The cAMP production that is induced is directly proportional to the glucagon or GLP-1 binding to its receptor. HEK293 cells co-transfected with the glucagon or GLP-1 receptor, respectively, and luciferase gene linked to a cAMP responsive element were employed for the bioassay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cells were serum-deprived by culturing 16 hours in Dulbecco Minimum Essential Medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) supplemented with 0.25% Bovine Growth Serum (HyClone, Logan, Utah) and then incubated with serial dilutions of either GLP-1 analogs or prodrugs for 5 hours at 37° C., 5% CO\n2 \nin 96 well poly-D-Lysine-coated “Biocoat” plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). At the end of the incubation, 100 μL of LucLite luminescence substrate reagent (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.) were added to each well. The plate was shaken briefly, incubated 10 min in the dark and light output was measured on MicroBeta-1450 liquid scintillation counter (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, Mass.). The effective 50% concentrations (EC\n50\n) were calculated by using Origin software (OriginLab, Northampton, Mass.).\n\n\n \nExample 3 \n\n\nBioactivity of GLP-1 Amide-Based Prodrugs\n\n\n \n \n \nI) GLP-Oxyntomodulin\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe GLP-oxyntomodulin chimeric peptide (SEQ ID NO: 610) of which the last eight amino acids were derived from oxyntomodulin was synthesized.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 610)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHAEGTFTSDVSSYLEGQAAKEFIAWLVKGRGKRNRNNIA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe rationale behind synthesizing this chimeric peptide was two-fold: (1) to demonstrate that a peptide of a mass of around 4300 Da could be synthesized and (2) if this peptide is shown to be biologically potent, then a GLP-1 analog with an extended C-terminus could be used as a base sequence for GLP-1 peptides having other modifications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe GLP-oxyntomodulin peptide was found to have a mass of 4322.5 Daltons. The receptor binding activity of GLP-oxyntomodulin peptide was determined by the GLP-receptor luciferase assay described in Example 2 to be at least as potent as the native GLP-1 peptide in the luciferase assay.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nII) Adding Dipeptides to the N Terminus\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo study the ability of prodrugs to intramolecularly cyclize, cleave, and form a diketopiperazine (DKP) or diketomorpholine (DMP), different dipeptides were covalently attached to the N-terminus of GLP-1 (aa 7-37). The biologically inactive, dipeptide-extended GLP-1 peptides were designed for conversion into the active peptide drug (GLP-1 (aa7-37) upon cleavage of the amide bond along with formation of DKP or DMP. This is represented schematically in \nFIGS. 5A and 5B\n. Prodrugs of varying half lives were envisioned by chemically modifying the side chains of the amino acids of the dipeptide (R\n1 \nand R\n2\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe first peptide synthesized (named G\n5\nP\n6\nH\n7\n,GLP(8-37)) comprised a Gly-Pro dipeptide attached to the N-terminus of GLP-1 (aa7-37). The peptide was prepared synthetically by solid phase synthesis as described above. The synthesis was confirmed by MALDI-MS analysis (3509.5 Da).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGLP-1(aa7-37)-based peptide prodrugs comprising either a Pro-Pro dipeptide or a Pro-His dipeptide were similarly synthesized. The dipeptide extension Gly-Phe or Phe-Phe were synthesized to facilitate DPK formation by sterically assisting in the cleavage of the amide bond. It was hypothesized that the cis-orientation of proline would contribute in the facilitation of the dipeptide's adoption of an optimal steric conformation for the formation of DKP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWith regard to the peptide comprising the Pro-His dipeptide, the carbonyl bond of interest was sandwiched between two histidines (amino acid Y and the histidyl leaving group). This design was directed at a proton assisted cleavage of the amide bond via diketopiperazine formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn acid-base catalyzed general hydrolysis of the amide bond was attempted by synthesizing peptides comprising an addition of a single amino acid (γ-Glu, Glu, Phe, or His). Since, the leaving group would be the histidine at the N-terminus of the active peptide (GLP-1(aa7-37), it was purported that the imidazole ring might assist in the cleavage by general acid-base catalysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach N-terminally extended peptide was incubated in PBS buffer at 37° C. for approximately a week. Alternatively, each peptide was heated for 120 min at 100° C. to accelerate the amide bond cleavage. Cleavage of the prodrugs was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC and MS. As shown in Table 1, none of the amide bonds of any of the peptides cleaved, demonstrating the robustness of the amide bond (Table 1).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttempted cleavage of H\n7\n, GLP(7-37) prodrugs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto form native GLP-1(aa7-37)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nRate of cleavage at\n\n\nRate of cleavage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\n(Xaa\n1\nYaa\n2\n-GLP1)\n\n\n100° C.\n\n\nat 37° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nGP\n\n\nNo cleavage\n\n\nNo \ncleavage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nPP\n\n\nNo cleavage\n\n\nNo \ncleavage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nγ Glu\n\n\nNo cleavage\n\n\nNo cleavage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nE\n\n\nNo cleavage\n\n\nNo cleavage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nP\n\n\nNo cleavage\n\n\nNo cleavage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nH\n\n\nNo cleavage\n\n\nNo \ncleavage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nPH\n\n\nNo cleavage\n\n\nNo cleavage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn Compounds 4, 5 and 6, a single amino acid was added to the N terminus of GLP-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn all cases, there is a histidine in the 1\nst\nposition (histidyl leaving group) of GLP-1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBased on these data, it was hypothesized that the imidazole nucleus was playing an attenuating role in the cleavage of the amide bond. To test this possibility, peptides having a different leaving group were studied. Specifically, peptides comprising aa 7-37 of GLP-1 with the His at \nposition\n 7 replaced with Phe (named F\n7\n,GLP(8-37)) were synthesized and purified using the procedure described above. This peptide was determined as a full agonist having 10% the potency of native GLP. Dipeptides were added to the N-terminus of F\n7\n,GLP(8-37) to study the cleavage of the amide bond between the dipeptide and the N-terminus of the active peptide (F\n7\n,GLP(8-37)) and formation of DKP. In a first peptide prodrug of F\n7\n,GLP(8-37), Gly-Pro was added to the N-terminus, whereas in a second peptide prodrug, sarcosine was used, as it has been previously reported to enhance the rate of cleavage (Hamel, A. R. et al., (2004) \nJournal of Peptide Research \n63: 147-154)). Although both dipeptide extensions were designed to sterically assist in the cleavage of the amide bond, the amide bond remained resistance to cleavage (Table 2).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttempted cleavage of dipeptide extended F\n7\n, GLP(7-37)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPeptide\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\n(Xaa\n1\nYaa\n2\n-F\n7a\n-\n\n\nRate of cleavage at\n\n\nRate of cleavage at\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\nGLP8-37)\n\n\n100° C.\n\n\n37° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nGP\n\n\nNo cleavage\n\n\nNo \ncleavage\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nGSar\nb\n \n\n\nNo cleavage\n\n\nNo cleavage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \na\nIn all cases there is phenylalanine in the 1\nst \nposition (phenylalanyl leaving group) of GLP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nb\nSar represents sarcosine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIII) Adding Dipeptides to the N terminus of F\n7\n,GLP(8-36)-CEX\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe F\n7\n,GLP(8-37) analogs were found to exhibit poor solubility in PBS at 37° C. Hence, a modified GLP-1 analog of SEQ ID NO: 611 (named GLP(7-36)-CEX amide) comprising the last ten amino acids of Exendin-4 with a C-terminal amide in place of an acid group was prepared.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(SEQ ID NO: 611)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nH\n7\nAEGTFTSDVSSYLEGQAAKEFIAWLVKGXPSSGAPPPS-amide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGLP(7-36)-CEX amide had been observed to be approximately ten times more potent in vitro than the native GLP-1 sequence, and analogs of this peptide were found to be appreciably more soluble in PBS.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProdrugs of an analog of GLP(7-36)-CEX amide in which Phe replaced the His at \nposition\n 7 were synthesized comprising a Gly-Gly dipeptide (G\n5\nG\n6\nF\n7\n,GLP(8-36)-CEX) or an OH-Gly-Gly dipeptide, in which the alpha amino group was replaced with a hydroxyl group (OH-G\n5\nG\n6\nF\n7\n,GLP(8-36)-CEX). These peptides were tested to check the effect of the less bulky glycyl leaving group and to determine if either of the nucleophiles (amine or hydroxyl) could cleave the amide bond by 2,5-diketopiperazine or 2,5-diketomorpholine formation respectively and thus regenerate the active F\n7\n,GLP(8-36)-CEX peptide.

The coupling procedures are described in the experimental section and they proved highly effective. As before, dipeptides of differential tendency for intramolecular cyclization (diketopiperazine formation) and release of the parent drug (N-terminal hydroxyl peptide) were studied. While adding the dipeptide, both an amine nucleophile cleaving an ester bond and a hydroxyl nucleophile cleaving an ester bond were prepared and studied.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nV) Adding Dipeptides to the OH Terminus of HO—F\n7\n,GLP(8-36)-CEX\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe HO—F\n7\n,GLP(8-36)-CEX peptide was synthesized from the GLP(8-36)-CEX PAM resin (the synthetic scheme is represented in \nFIG. 1\n) and served as the parent drug for these experiments. This peptide has an EC\n50 \nvalue of 0.008 nM (\nFIG. 2\n) while native GLP-1 has an EC\n50 \nvalue of 0.011 nM. Therefore, the HO—F\n7\n,GLP(8-36)-CEX was found to be at least as potent as the native GLP-1. This is a most important and a somewhat unexpected observation that the histidine can be substituted by phenyllactic acid. This warranted additional validation. Subsequent experiments yielded identical results. The possibility exists that this result is a function of the CEX extension in the HO—F\n7\n,GLP(8-36)-CEX. In this regard, it has been reported that the C-terminal region of exendin-4 increases its affinity to the GLP-1 receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe α hydroxyl group of HO—F\n7\n,GLP(8-36)-CEX was acylated and both an amine nucleophile cleaving an ester bond; \nFIG. 5A\n and a hydroxyl nucleophile cleaving an ester bond; \nFIG. 5B\n compounds were prepared and studied. Along with the 2,5-diketopiperazine (amine nucleophile) or 2,5-diketomorpholine (hydroxyl nucleophile), the biologically active HO—F\n7\n,GLP(8-36)-CEX is released as shown in \nFIGS. 5A and 5B\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo explore the possible formation of 2,5-diketopiperazine (DKP) or 2,5-diketomorpholine (DMP) and the simultaneous generation of HO—F\n7\n,GLP(8-36)-CEX, the prodrug was incubated in PBS buffer at 37° C. for approximately a week. The peptide was also heated at 100° C. to determine the susceptibility to cleavage (Table 4).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleavage of dipeptide extended HO-F\n7\n, GLP(7-36)-CEX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeptide\n\n\nPeptide (Yaa1Xaa2-O-Phe\n7\n-GLP-8-36-\n\n\nt\n1/2\n* of cleavage at\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\nCEX)\n\n\n37° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nGly-Gly\n\n\n0.87 \nhrs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nHO-Gly-Gly\n\n\n1.13 \nhrs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nHO-Phe-\nVal\n \n \nNo cleavage\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nHO-Phe-dVal\n\n\n50.58 \nhrs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nHO-Phe-Ala\n\n\n2.83 \nhrs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nHO-Phe-dAla\n\n\n2.41 \nhrs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nHO-Phe-Gly\n\n\n2.46 \nhrs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nHO-Phe-Phe\n\n\n33.31 \nhrs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nHO-Phe-dPhe\n\n\n7.65 \nhrs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nPhe-Val\n\n\n64.0 hrs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n*t\n1/2 \nis the time required for 50% release of the HO-Phe-GLP8-36-CEX at 37° C. in PBS (pH7.2).

The results validated our expectation that the esters are more susceptible to cleavage than the amides. The relatively slower rate of cleavage of \n \n \n \n \npeptides\n \n \n \n \n 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10 suggest that the bulk of the dipeptide extensions (Phe or Val) greatly affect the rate of prodrug cleavage. While there is virtually no difference between a methyl and a hydrogen side chain (\n \npeptide\n \n 5, 6 and 7), the presence of an isopropyl group (β branching) greatly attenuates the rate of ester cleavage as evidenced in \n \n \npeptides\n \n \n 3, 4 and 10. \nPeptide\n 10 dissociates faster than \npeptide\n 3 as the amine is a stronger nucleophile as compared to the hydroxyl, a point corroborated by \n \npeptides\n \n 1 and 2 as well. Finally, the large difference in the t\n1/2 \nbetween \n \npeptides\n \n 8 and 9 indicates that the side chain interactions in the dipeptide (R1 and R2 in \nFIGS. 5A and 5B\n) play an important role as well. This same effect is shown in \n \npeptides\n \n 3 and 4. In both instances, the L,D-dipeptide diastereoisomer cleaves faster than the corresponding L,L-diastereoisomer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe structure of \n \n \npeptides\n \n \n 4, 8 and 10 are represented as shown in \nFIGS. 6A-6C\n. The observed half life of the prodrug increases as the substituent X gets bulkier (\n \n \n \n \npeptides\n \n \n \n \n 3, 4, 8, 9 and 10 in Table 4). This is probably because the transition state (TS) is more sterically hindered as the size of X increases. Consequently, the energy of activation increases thereby increasing the stability of the prodrug.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis is especially exemplified for the two pairs of stereoisomers (\n \npeptides\n \n 3 and 4; 8 and 9). Here, by changing the stereochemistry of a single amino acid in the C-terminus of the dipeptide extension, a huge difference in rate was observed. The steric hindrance of the corresponding transition states is far greater in a L,L-dipeptide diastereoisomer as compared to a L,D-diastereoisomer. Hence, \npeptide\n 3 has a greater t\n1/2\n, as compared to \npeptide\n 4, and \npeptide\n 8 has a t\n1/2 \ngreater than \npeptide\n 9.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nPeptide\n 10 is F\n5\nV\n6\n—O—F\n7\n,GLP(8-36)-CEX. This has a t\n1/2 \nof 64 hrs and represents the longest duration peptidic prodrug to cleavage under physiological conditions. The transition state in this case is sizably hindered because of the steric interaction between the phenylalanyl and the valyl side chain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cleavage of peptide 10 (\nFIG. 6B\n) (4264 Da) to form the parent drug HO—F\n7\n,GLP(8-36)-CEX (4019 Da) is an intramolecular cyclization. Therefore it is assumed that the presence of other impurities do not affect the rate of internal dissociation. In addition, both the prodrug and the drug have been followed with a MALDI analysis even in the midst of contaminating peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA second set of analogous depsipeptides were also studied to further examine the effects of the dipeptide extension structure upon the rate of cleavage (Table 5). Their synthesis follows the same pattern as outlined in \nFIGS. 3 and 4\n. The major difference is that in this case, the R2 or Y site is a less hindered hydrogen (glycyl residue) instead of a bulky phenylalanyl. In this case a glycolic acid (OH-glycine) or a glycine were used at the terminal end of the prodrug.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleavage of ester bond in HO-G\n5\nX\n6\n-O-F\n7\n, GLP(7-36)CEX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nPeptide (Yaa1Xaa2-O-Phe\n7\n-GLP-8-36-\n\n\nt\n1/2 \nof cleavage at\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\nCEX)\n\n\n37° C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nGly-Gly\n\n\n0.87 \nhr\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nHO-Gly-Gly\n\n\n1.13 \nhrs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nHO-Gly-Val\n\n\n4.70 \nhrs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nHO-Gly-dVal\n\n\n5.13 \nhrs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nHO-Gly-\n1\nAIB\n\n\n0.75 \nhrs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nHO-Gly-\n2\nPhG\n\n\n0.49 \nhrs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nHO-Gly-\n3\ntBut\n\n\nDid not cleave\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nHO-Gly-Phe\n\n\n0.70 \nhrs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nHO-Gly-dPhe\n\n\n0.93 \nhrs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nGly-Val\n\n\n20.38 hrs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\n1/2 \nis the time required for 50% release of the HO-Phe-GLP8-36-CEX at 37° C. in PBS (pH7.2).

The first two peptides shown in Table 4 (\nPeptides\n 1 and 2) were analyzed to determine if either of the nucleophiles (amine or hydroxyl) could cleave the ester bond by 2,5-diketopiperazine or 2,5-diketomorpholine formation respectively. These two peptides had been analyzed in Table 5 and were tested again to serve as positive controls. As expected, both of the nucleophiles studied could cleave the ester bond. This set of compounds (\nCompounds\n 2 to 9 in Table 5) are expected to cleave faster than in the previous case, as the steric bulk is removed. As the size of X becomes structurally bulkier, the transition state gets increasingly crowded. Consequently, the energy of activation increases thereby increasing the stability of the prodrug. This is what is seen in \ncompound\n 10 where X is an isopropyl (valine) group (see \nFIG. 6D\n for the compounds structure). When X is a tertiary butyl group (compound 7), the compound does not cleave at all in PBS buffer (pH, 7.2) at 37° C. In Table 5, the pairs of stereoisomers (\n \ncompounds\n \n 3 and 4; 8 and 9) dissociate at nearly the same rate. This is probably because the stereoisomers do not show a large difference in energy (purportedly because of the non-chiral nature of glycine). Hence, in this case, both the glycyl,L-dipeptide extension and the glycyl,D-dipeptide extension have a comparable energetic transition state.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe observation that compound 3 dissociates faster than \ncompound\n 10 seems to suggest that the hydroxyl is a stronger nucleophile as compared to the amine at a pH of 7.2 and 37° C. One possible explanation for this anomaly might be that the pKa of the N-terminal amine is slightly increased in \ncompound\n 10. As a result, at a pH of 7.2, this amine nucleophile would be disproportionately protonated and thus account for the slower rate of prodrug cleavage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThus, our results indicate that the structural nature of the side chain (especially β branching as evidenced in dipeptides containing valine and tert-butyl glycine); the stereochemistry and the pKa of the nucleophile serve a role in determining the relative rate of cleavage.

Both prodrugs display a higher potency after being incubated in PBS for 24 hours due to gradual conversion to the parent drug (see \nFIGS. 7 and 8\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nVII) Ester Prodrugs from Internal Sites of the Peptide\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe prodrugs disclosed herein spontaneously convert under physiological conditions (pH=7.2 and temperature=37° C.) to yield the parent drug. pH and temperature are relied upon for this conversion, as they are virtually invariant physiologically and this also eliminates the need for any specific enzyme mediated processing of the prodrug to its active form. The prodrug chemistry that has been established at the N-terminal end should also be translatable for use at internal bio-active sites from which an ester prodrug can be prepared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo make an ester prodrug, a judicious choice of serine/threonine residue was explored at which the dipeptide could be added. The peptide must be biologically active before the addition of the dipeptide and inactive after the addition, in analogous fashion to our results at the terminal end of GLP-1. Hence, the peptide variants were tested for biological activity prior to pursuit of the prodrug modified forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSynthesis and Analysis of Prodrugs at Internal Sites\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTwo peptides were synthesized as possible starting points for development of internal prodrug candidates. The first peptide was (H7F),(E9Q),GLP(8-36)-CEX and the second one was (H7F),(E9Q),(T11S),GLP(8-36)-CEX. The synthesis of an ester prodrug was attempted at the hydroxyl group of the 5\nth \namino acid (threonine or serine side chain of (H7F),(E9Q),GLP(8-36)-CEX and (H7F),(E9Q),(T11S),GLP(8-36)-CEX, respectively). For these molecules, a Boc benzyl-type synthesis on a PAM resin was conducted until the point of Phe at the 12\nth \nposition. The rest of the synthesis was completed using Fmoc-based chemistry. This offered the opportunity to selectively remove the protecting group of the serine side chain, leaving all the other protecting groups intact. This allowed for the selective acylation on the free hydroxyl group of the serine at the 11\nth \nposition.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore specifically a Boc-benzyl strategy could not be used throughout the synthesis as the hydroxyl protecting benzyl group of serine would require HF treatment for removal. Consequently, an ester prodrug could not be synthesized on the peptidic resin as the HF treatment would simultaneous remove the peptide from the resin. This is why a Ser was added at the 11\nth \nposition (Fmoc-O-t butyl-L-seine) and the subsequent Gly, Gln, Ala and Phe as Fmoc-protected amino acids. The t-butyl protecting group of the serine was selectively removed by treatment with TFA for 2 hours. The Boc-protected dipeptidic pro-moiety was added to this hydroxyl group to finish the synthesis of the ester prodrug. The final Boc-protecting group was removed by treatment with TFA and the N-terminal Fmoc group was removed by treatment with 20% piperidine in DMF. This was found to be a useful strategy to build the dipeptide esters from the hydroxyl side chain of serine and threonine residues. The glutamic acid residue at the 3\nrd \nposition was also replaced with glutamine to prevent any unwanted coupling on the side chain carboxyl group. It was assumed that this would not lead to a loss of activity as previous reports have suggested that the 3\nrd \nposition is not critical for GLP-1 potency.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe bio-assay was conducted after purification of these peptides by HPLC, and confirmation of their masses by MALDI as described previously. Percent potency was calculated and the mean EC\n50 \nof the peptide (drug candidate) was compared with that of native GLP-1.

It was decided that both these peptides were sufficiently potent for development as potential drug candidates.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA Gly-Gly dipeptide was envisioned to be added to these GLP-1 analogs as an initial investigation of its synthetic ease. The hydroxyl group of the serine side chain was easier to acylate as compared to the bulkier threonine side chain. One potential prodrug (H7F),(E9Q),[T11S—O\nβ\n-(Gly-Gly)],GLP(8-36)-CEX was synthesized by adding a Gly-Gly dipeptide to the hydroxyl of the serine side chain. In this regard, the t\n1/2 \nof the Gly-Gly terminal ester prodrugs were ˜1 hr (Table 5), whereas the t\n1/2 \nof the internal ester prodrug was found to be approximately three times longer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt was observed that the (H7F),(E9Q),[T11S—O\nβ\n-(Gly-Gly)],GLP(8-36)-CEX prodrug dissociated with a t\n1/2\n=2.7 hrs to yield the parent drug (H7F),(E9Q),(T11S),GLP(8-36)-CEX along with the 2,5-diketopiperazine (DKP). The absolute potency of this prodrug was not determined because its half life is lower than the incubation period of the prodrug in the cell culture based luciferase assay (5 hrs). The half life of the prodrug (2.7 hrs) indicates that approximately 70% of the prodrug would have converted to the active entity in 5 hours; hence the assay could not be accurately performed on this prodrug.

About 100˜120 mg [PLA6, E9, C24(40K)]glucagon (6-29) amide can be obtained which analytical HPLC analysis shown retention time as 8.60˜8.8 min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar procedure was used to synthesize [PLA6, C8(40K), E9]glucagon (6-29) amide, [PLA6, E9, C16(40K)]glucagon (6-29) amide and [PLA6, E9, C40(40K)]glucagon (6-40) amide, [PLA6, D9, C16(40K)]glucagon (6-29) amide and [PLA6, D9, C24(40K)]glucagon (6-29) amide.\n\n\n \nSynthesis of Dimer[PLA6, E9, C24]Glucagon (6-29) Amide\n\n\n \n \n \n20 mg (0.00675 mmole) [PLA6, E9, C24]glucagon (6-29) amide was dissolved in 6 ml PBS buffer, 1 ml 1M Tris base (adjust pH 8.0˜8.5) and 3 ml DMSO. The reaction mixture was stirred in an open air container and monitored by analytical HPLC every 2 hr. After the initial product (\nHPLC RT\n 7 4 min) was gone and the dimer product (HPLC RT 7.9 min) was the dominate product (after 12 hr), the mixture was diluted with 0.1% TFA10% acetonitrile water and directly purified by preparative HPLC. After lyophilized about 6-8 mg Dimer[PLA6, E9, C24]glucagon (6-29) amide was obtained with ESI-MS 5920.0 corresponding the calculated MW 5920.6.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA similar procedure was used to synthesize the Dimer[C9]glucagon(6-29) amide with ESI-MS 5916.0 corresponding the calculated MW 5916.6 and Dimer[C5, E9]glucagon(5-29) amide with ESI-MS 6174.0 corresponding the calculated MW 6174.8.\n\n\n \n \nAcylated and/or PEGylated Peptides are Prepared as Follows.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPeptides are synthesized on a solid support resin using either a CS Bio 4886 Peptide Synthesizer or Applied Biosystems 430A Peptide Synthesizer. In situ neutralization chemistry is used as described by Schnolzer et al., \nInt. J. Peptide Protein Res. \n40: 180-193 (1992). For acylated peptides, the target amino acid residue to be acylated (e.g., position ten) is substituted with an N ε-FMOC lysine residue. Treatment of the completed N-terminally BOC protected peptide with 20% piperidine in DMF for 30 minutes removes FMOC/formyl groups. Coupling to the free ε-amino Lys residue is achieved by coupling a ten-fold molar excess of either an FMOC-protected spacer amino acid (ex. FMOC-(N-BOC)-Tryptophan-OH) or acyl chain (ex. C17-COOH) and PyBOP or DEPBT coupling reagent in DMF/DIEA. Subsequent removal of the spacer amino acid's FMOC group is followed by repetition of coupling with an acyl chain. Final treatment with 100% TFA results in removal of any side chain protecting groups and the N-terminal BOC group. Peptide resins are neutralized with 5% DIEA/DMF, dried, and then cleaved from the support using HF/p-cresol, 95:5, at 0° C. for one hour. Following ether extraction, a 5% HOAc solution is used to solvate the crude peptide. A sample of the solution is then verified to contain the correct molecular weight peptide by ESI-MS. Correct peptides are purified by RP-HPLC using a linear gradient of 10% CH3CN/0.1% TFA to 0.1% TFA in 100% CH3CN. A Vydac C18 22 mm×250 mm protein column is used for the purification. Acylated peptide analogs generally complete elution by a buffer ratio of 20:80. Portions are pooled together and checked for purity on an analytical RP-HPLC. Pure fractions are lyophilized yielding white, solid peptides.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a peptide comprises a lactam bridge and target residues to be acylated, acylation is carried out as described above upon addition of that amino acid to the peptide backbone.\n\n\n \n \nFor peptide pegylation, 40 kDa methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) maleimido-propionamide (Chirotech Technology Ltd.) is reacted with a molar equivalent of peptide in 7M Urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer using the minimal amount of solvent needed to dissolve both peptide and PEG into a clear solution (generally less than 2 mL for a reaction using 2-3 mg peptide). Vigorous stirring at room temperature is commenced for 4-6 hours and the reaction is analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC. PEGylated products appear distinct from the starting material with decreased retention times. Purification is performed on a Vydac C4 column with conditions similar to those used for the initial peptide purification. Elution occurrs around buffer ratios of 50:50. Fractions of pure PEGylated peptide are found and lyophilized.\n\n\n \nSynthesis of Cholesterolylated Peptides\n\n\n \n \n \nThe cholesterol-modified peptides were prepared by conjugating lactamized peptides with a bromoacetylated cholesterol derivative in solution. The peptides were assembled using conventional solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The PLA derivatized peptide chain was cylized via a lactam bridge. The standard cleavage procedure and purification method were applied to obtain the desired depsipeptide.\n\n\n \nExample\n\n\nSynthesis of cholesterol conjugated lactam-bridge peptide [PLA6, K10(COCH2CH2S-Chol), E16K20(lactam), D28]G(6-29) amide\n\n\n \n \n \nA peptidyl resin with sequence HO-PLA-TSDKSKYLDERRAKDFVQWLMDT [PLA6, K10, E16, K20, D28]glucagon(6-29) was synthesized by solid-phase Boc-chemistry using an ABI 430A automated peptide synthesizer with 0.2 mmole MBHA amide resin and DEPBT as coupling reagent.

To this solution was added 10 mg (9 μM) of cholesterol reagent Br-Oxa\n12\n-Chol (see the structure below), at room temperature. The reaction was monitored by HPLC.

They display a broad pharmacological effect stretching from the full agonistic agents exhibiting anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative-hypnotic and myorelaxant activities to the inverse agonistic agents, which displays anxiogenic, somnolytic and convulsant activities. In between antagonistic agents that elicit no pharmacological effect are present.\n\n\nThe (GABA\nA\n)/BzR complex is a membrane-bound pentameric ligand gated chloride ion channel assembled of at least 21 subunits from eight different classes Ca\n1-6\n, β\n1-4\n, ΪM, δ, ε, π, θ, and P\n1\n-\n3\n)-\n1\n \" The large number of possible assemblies is somewhat reduced as a completely operational (GABA\nA\n)/BzR consist of at least one α, one β and one γ subunit, and the most abundant receptors in vivo contain two α, two β and one γ subunits. Moreover the αfe a\n2\nβ\nx\nγ\n2\n, a\n3\nβ\nχ\nγ\n2\n and α\n5\nβ\nx\nγ\n2\n subtype assemblies are regard as the major benzodiazepine binding receptors, the benzodiazepine binding-site being located at the interface between the α and the γ subunit. Recent studies with transgenic mice and subtype selective compounds clearly suggest that receptors with different subtype composition are associated with different physiological effect e.g. cn-containing receptors mediate sedation and anterograde amnesia, α\n2\n-, and/or α\n3\n- containing receptors are involved in anxiolytic activity, and α\n5\n-containing receptors might be associated with cognition and memory.\"\nMV\n \n\n\nA broad spectrum of BzR binding non-benzodiazepines has been presented and among the most potent are compounds belonging to the following classes cyclopyrrolones, 2- arylpyrazoloquinolines, ^-carbolines, pyridodiindoles, triazoloqunioxalines, pyrimidin-5(6H)-ones, and quinolines. Structure-activity relationship of 136 different ligands from ten structurally different classes of compounds was applied in the creation of a comprehensive pharmacophore \n\n model for the BZ receptor. TJie model was developed under the hypothesis that BZ receptor agonists, inverse agonists, and antagonists all share the same binding pocket.\n\n\nSummary of the present invention The present invention relates to novel GABA\nA\n/BzR ligands, in particular different isozoloquinolinyl derivatives.\n\n\nRecently, a series of synthetic flavones derivatives were used for the further development of the pharmacophore model. \nv vι\n In the present application a series of novel ligands developed through the pharmacophore model i.e. isothiazoloquinolinones (I), isoxazoloquinolinones (II), and isothiazoloquinolinyl amides (III) is presented. (The Roman numbers relates to the formulas of Figure 1).The ligands are somewhat structurally different, but developed through essentially the same diversified synthetic routes. The proposed binding mode of the novel ligands are showed in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows three novel BzR ligands in the pharmacophore model representation.\n\n\nIn Figure 1 H\n1\n and H\n2\n represent hydrogen bond donor and hydrogen bond acceptor sites, respectively. H\n2\n/A\n3\n is a bifunctional site with ability to both accept and donate a hydrogen bond. L\n1\n, L\n2\n and L\n3\n are lipophilic pockets and S\n1\n-S\n5\n denotes regions of steric repulsive ligand-receptor interactions (receptor essential volume). The three classes of compounds I, Il and III all seams to fulfill the requirements necessary for a strong binding to the BzR. Compounds belonging to class I and Il have the ability to donate a hydrogen bond to A\n2\n through NH(6) and accept hydrogen bonds from H\n1\n through N(2) and H\n2\n through the O=C(4) oxygen. Moreover the fused benzene ring and the phenyl group occupy the lipophilic pockets L\n1\n and L\n2\n, respectively. The compounds belonging to class III binds similar to a class I or Il compound, but with the ability to form possibly two additional hydrogen bonds. The oxygen of the amide moiety might function as an additional hydrogen bond acceptor to the H\n1\n, and the NH moiety might be involved as a hydrogen bond donor to the A\n3\n site. The fused benzene ring and the carbamoyl chain occupy the lipophilic pockets L\n1\n and L\n2\n, respectively. The L\n1\nZL\n2\n lipophilic pocket was probed by introducing a small number of substituents, especially for the class I compounds, in the position corresponding to this region.\n\n\nSUBSI HU II:

either an acid addition salt or a basic addition salt which is compatible with the treatment of patients. A \"pharmaceutically acceptable ^ acid addition salt\" is any non-toxic organic or inorganic acid addition salt of the base compounds represented by Formula I or any of its intermediates. Illustrative inorganic acids which form suitable salts include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric and phosphoric acid and acid metal salts such as sodium monohydrogen orthophosphate and potassium hydrogen sulfate. Illustrative organic acids which form suitable salts include the mono-, di- and tricarboxylic acids. Illustrative of such acids are, for example, acetic, glycolic, lactic, pyruvic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, benzoic, hydroxybenzoic, phenylacetic, cinnamic, salicylic, 2-phenoxybenzoic, p-toluenesulfonic acid and other sulfonic acids such as methanesulfonic acid and 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid. Either the mono- or di- acid salts can be formed, and such salts can exist in either a hydrated, solvated or substantially anhydrous form. In general, the acid addition salts of these compounds are more soluble in water and various hydrophilic organic solvents, and generally demonstrate higher melting points in comparison to their free base forms. The selection criteria for the appropriate salt will be known to one skilled in the art. Other non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts e.g. oxalates may be used for example in the isolation of compounds of Formula I for laboratory use, or for subsequent conversion to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt.\n\n\nA \"pharmaceutically acceptable basic addition salt\" is any non-toxic organic or inorganic base addition salt of the acid compounds represented by Formula I or any of its intermediates. Illustrative inorganic bases which form suitable salts include lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or barium hydroxides. Illustrative organic bases which form suitable salts include aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic organic amines such as methylamine, trimethyl amine and picoline or ammonia. The selection of the appropriate salt may be important so that an ester functionality, if any, elsewhere in the molecule is not hydrolyzed. The selection criteria for the appropriate salt will be known to one skilled in the art.\n\n\n\"Solvate\" means a compound of Formula I or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of Formula I wherein molecules of a suitable solvent are incorporated in a crystal lattice. A suitable solvent is physiologically tolerable at the dosage administered as the solvate. Examples of suitable solvents are ethanol, water and the like. When water is the solvent, the molecule is referred to as a hydrate. The term \"stereoisomers\" is a general term for all isomers of the individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. It includes \n\n mirror image isomers (enantiomers), geometric (cis/trans) isomers and isomers of compounds with more than one chiral centre that are not mirror images of one another (diastereomers).\n\n\nThe present invention will be described more in detail in the following with reference to examples for producing the active compounds of the invention, as well as test results showing the activity of the compounds.\n\n\nThe term \"treat\" or \"treating\" means to alleviate symptoms, eliminate the causation of the symptoms either on a temporary or permanent basis, or to prevent or slow the appearance of symptoms of the named disorder or condition.\n\n\nThe term \"therapeutically effective amount\" means an amount of the compound which is effective in treating the named disorder or condition.\n\n\nThe term \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" means a non-toxic solvent, dispersant, excipient, adjuvant or other material which is mixed with the active ingredient in order to permit the formation of a pharmaceutical composition, i.e., a dosage form capable of administration to the patient. One example of such a carrier is a pharmaceutically acceptable oil typically used for parenteral administration. It will be understood by those of skill in the art that when compounds of the present invention contain one or more chiral centers, the compounds of the invention may exist in, and be isolated as, enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms, or as a racemic mixture. The present invention includes any possible enantiomers, diastereomers, racemates or mixtures thereof, of a compound of formula I. The optically active forms of the compound of the invention may be prepared, for example, by chiral chromatographic separation of a racemate or chemical or enzymatic resolution methodology, by synthesis from optically active starting materials or by asymmetric synthesis based on the procedures described thereafter.\n\n\nIt will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that certain compounds of the present invention may exist as geometrical isomers, for example E and Z isomers of alkenes. The present invention includes any geometrical isomer of a compound of formula I. It will further be understood that the present invention encompasses tautomers of the compounds of formula I.\n\n\nIt will also be understood by those of skill in the art that certain compounds of the present \n\n invention may exist in solvated, for example hydrated, as well as unsolvated forms. It will further be understood that the present invention encompasses all such solvated forms of the compounds of formula I.\n\n\nChemistry\n\n\nAll compounds belonging to classes I, Il and III are as far as presently known all novel compounds. The synthesis of the compounds is shown in schemes 1 and 2 below.\n\n\nIn the reaction schemes shown the key intermediate 5 and 6 were obtained by treatment of anthranilic acids with carbon disulfide and iodomethane followed by cyclization in refluxing acetic anhydride. Nucleophilic addition of lithium enolates of various acetophenones yielded the keto- enols 7 to 12. Cyclization in sodium methoxide gave the corresponding quinolone derivative 13 to 18. The isothiazoloquinolinones 19-24 were obtained by treatment of the quinolone derivative 13-18 with hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid. The isoxazoloquinoazolones 25-27 could be obtained by treatment with hydroxylamine and cyclization with Amberlyst 15, subsequently. Following essentially the same route utilizing a nuclophilic addition of a lithium salt of acetonitrile to 5 as the key step led to the synthesis of cyano derivative 29. Treatment with hydroxylamine-O- sulfonic acid gave aminothioisoxazole 30, which due to limited stability in solution was used as a crude. Treatment with acid chlorides yielded isothiazoloquinolinyl amides 31 and 32. It was believed that strong binders to the BzR could be obtained by exchanging the alkyl chain to various aromatics. Unfortunately, the solubility of a few other isothiazoloquinolinyl amides synthesized was too poor to enable easy purification and further biological evaluation of the compounds.\n\n\nI O \n\n Scheme l\na\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Ri = Me 3 R\n1\n = Me 5 R\n1\n = Me\n\n\n2 Ri = Br 4 R\n1\n = Br 6 R\n1\n = Br\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 R\n1\n = Me, R\n2\n = Me 13 R\n1\n = Me, R\n2\n = Me 19 R\n1\n = Me, R\n2\n = Me\n\n\n8 R\n1\n = Me, R\n2\n = H 14 R\n1\n = Me, R\n2\n = H 20 R\n1\n = Me, R\n2\n = H\n\n\n9 R\n1\n = Me, R\n2\n = Br 15 R\n1\n = Me, R\n2\n = Br 21 R\n1\n = Me, R\n2\n = Br\n\n\n10 R\n1\n = Me, R\n2\n = OMe 16 R\n1\n = Me, R\n2\n = OMe 22 R\n1\n = Me, R\n2\n = OMe\n\n\n11 R\n1\n = Me\n1\n R\n2\n = NO\n2\n 17 R\n1\n = Me, R\n2\n = NO\n2\n 23 R\n1\n = Me, R\n2\n = NO\n2\n \n\n\n12 R\n1\n = Br, R\n2\n = Me 18 R\n1\n = Br, R\n2\n = Me 24 R\n1\n = Br, R\n2\n = Me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13 R = Me 25 R = Me\n\n\n14 R = H 26 R = H 17 R = NO\n2\n 27 R = NO\n2\n \n\n\n\"Conditions (a) CS\n2\n, NEt\n3\n, dioxane, 5 \n0\nC, 18 h, then MeI, 5 \n0\nC, I h (b) Ac\n2\nO, reflux, 1 h (c) LDA, 4'-acetophenones, THF, -78 \n0\nC, 1 h, then 5 or 6, -78 \n0\nC to -30 \"C, 3 h (d) NaOMe, MeOH, 0 \n0\nC, 3 h (e)H\n2\nNOSO\n3\nH, LiOH, MeOH, rt, 24 h (f) NaOAc, H\n2\nNOH HCI, EtOH, reflux, 5 h, then Amberlyst 15, MeCN, reflux, 2 h \n\n\n\n\nScheme 2\na\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30 31 R = Pr\n\n\n32 R = Et\n\n\nConditions (a) LDA, MeCN, THF, -78 \n0\nC to -20\n0\nOC, I h, then 5, -20\n0\nC, I 5 h (b) NaOMe, MeOH, 0\n0\nC, I h (c) H\n2\nNOSO\n3\nH, NaHCO\n3\n, MeOH, DMF, rt, 2 h, then RCOCI, pyridine, DMF, 5 h\n\n\nExperimental section\n\n\nReagents and solvents were used from commercial sources without purification. \n1\nH and \n13\nC NMR were recorded at room temperature with a Bruker ARX300 or a Bruker DRX400 spectrometer.

Generally, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the present invention are obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example, by reacting a sufficiently basic compound, for example an alkyl amine with a suitable acid, for example, HCI or acetic acid, to afford a salt with a physiologically acceptable anion. It is also possible to make a corresponding alkali metal (such as sodium, potassium, or lithium) or an alkaline earth metal (such as a calcium) salt by treating a compound of the present invention having a suitably acidic proton, such as a carboxylic acid or a phenol, with one equivalent of an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxide or alkoxide (such as the ethoxide or methoxide), or a suitably basic organic amine (such as choline or meglumine) in an aqueous medium, followed by conventional purification techniques. Additionally, quaternary ammonium salts can be prepared by the addition of alkylating agents, for example, to neutral amines.\n\n\n21\n\n\nSUBS I I I UTF SHEET mULE 2fij \n\n In one embodiment of the present invention, the compound of formula I may be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, particularly, an acid addition salt such as a hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, acetate, fumarate, maleate, tartrate, citrate, methanesulphonate or p-toluenesulphonate.\n\n\nSpecific examples of the present invention include the following compounds, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, optical isomers, and combinations thereof:\n\n\nPharmaceutical Composition\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention may be formulated into conventional pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include, but are not limited to, powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets, and suppositories.\n\n\nA solid carrier can be one or more substances, which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, or tablet disintegrating agents. A solid carrier can also be an encapsulating material.\n\n\nhi powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid, which is in a mixture with the finely divided compound of the invention, or the active component, hi tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.\n\n\nFor preparing suppository compositions, a low-melting wax such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides and cocoa butter is first melted and the active ingredient is dispersed therein by, for example, stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized moulds and allowed to cool and solidify.\n\n\n22\n\n\nSUBSTITUTE SHhET (RI)I F oη \n\n Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, lactose, sugar, pectin, dextrin, starch, tragacanth, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, low-melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like.\n\n\nThe term composition is also intended to include the formulation of the active component with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component (with or without other carriers) is surrounded by a carrier which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets are included.\n\n\nTablets, powders, cachets, and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration.\n\n\nLiquid form compositions include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. For example, sterile water or water propylene glycol solutions of the active compounds may be liquid preparations suitable for parenteral administration. Liquid compositions can also be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.\n\n\nAqueous solutions for oral administration can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavoring agents, stabilizers, and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water together with a viscous material such as natural synthetic gums, resins, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and other suspending agents known to the pharmaceutical formulation art. Exemplary compositions intended for oral use may contain one or more coloring, sweetening, flavoring and/or preservative agents.\n\n\nDepending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will include from about 0.05%w (percent by weight) to about 99%w, more particularly, from about 0.10%w to 50%w, of the compound of the invention, all percentages by weight being based on the total weight of the composition. A therapeutically effective amount for the practice of the present invention can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using known criteria including the age, weight and response of the individual patient, and interpreted within the context of the disease which is being treated or which is being prevented."
