Description\n\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL FIELD\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to a novel 5/5- or 5/6-membered condensed ring cycloalkylamine derivative. The compound acts as a melanin concentrating hormone receptor antagonist, and is useful as a preventive or remedy for various circular system diseases, nervous system diseases, metabolic diseases, genital diseases, respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, etc.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND ART\n\n\n \n \n \nMelanin concentrating hormone (hereafter referred to as “MCH”) is a cyclic peptide hormone/neuro-peptide, which was for the first time isolated by Kawauchi, et al., in 1983 from sermon hypophysis [see Nature, Vol. 305, 321 (1983)]. The hormone is known to functionally antagonize for melanin cell stimulating hormone in fishes, to cause concentration of melanin granules in melanophore and participate in body color change [see International Review of Cytology, Vol. 126, 1 (1991); Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism, Vol. 5, 120 (1994)]. Also in mammals, MCH-containing neuron cells are localized in the hypothalamus lateral field and uncertain zone, but their nerve fibers project over a very wide scope in the brain [see The Journal of Comparative Neurology, Vol. 319, 218 (1992)], and MCH is considered to preside over various central functions in living bodies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHypothalamus lateral field is known of old as a feeding center, and furthermore, recently, molecular biological and pharmacological knowledge suggesting participation of MCH in controlling energetic homeostasis are much accumulated. That is, it is reported that expression of mRNA, which is an MCH precursor, is accelerated in the brains of ob/ob mice, db/db mice, KKAy mice, Zucker fatty rats which are model animals of hereditary obesity, and in the brains of fasting mice [see Nature, Vol. 380, 243 (1996); Diabetes, Vol. 47, 294 (1998); Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 268, 88 (2000); Molecular Brain Research, Vol. 92, 43 (2001)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAcute ventricular administration of MCH to rats was observed to induce accelerated feeding activity [Nature, Vol. 380, 243 (1996)] and chronic administration thereof invites obesity accompanied by polyphagy [see Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 99, 3240 (2002)]. Moreover, MCH precursor gene-deficient mice show reduced feed ingestion or rise in oxygen consumption per body weight compared to wild type mice, and their low body weight due to decrease in body fat was observed [see Nature, Vol. 396, 670 (1998)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, transgenic mice which express excessive MCH precursor develop obesity accompanied by polyphagy and insulin resistance [see The Journal of Clinical Investigation, Vol. 107, 379 (2001)]. Consequently, it is suggested that MCH is an important factor for developing obesity and participates in diseases induced by metabolic disorders or respiratory diseases for which obesity is one risk factor. Besides, MCH is known to participate also in anxiety-causing action, epilepsy, memory, learning, diuretic action, sodium/potassium excretory action, oxytocin secreting action, reproduction and reproductive function [see Peptides, Vol. 17, 171 (1996); Peptides, Vol. 18, 1095 (1997); Peptides, Vol. 15, 757 (1994); Journal of Neuroendocrinology, Vol. 8, 57 (1996); Critical Reviews in Neurobiology, Vol. 8, 221 (1994)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMCH causes versatile pharmacological actions through MCH receptors which are present mainly in the central nervous system. As receptors of MCH, at least two types of type 1 receptors (MCH-1R or SLC-1) and type 2 receptors (MCH-2R or SLT) are known [see Nature, Vol. 400, 261 (1999); Nature, Vol. 400, 265 (1999); Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 261, 622 (1999); Nature Cell Biology, Vol. 1, 267 (1999); FEBS Letters, Vol. 457, 522 (1999); Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 283, 1013 (2001); The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 276, 20125 (2001); Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 98, 7564 (2001); Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 98, 7576 (2001); The Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 276, 34664 (2001); Molecular Pharmacology, Vol. 60, 632 (2001)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOf those, the pharmacological action observed on rodents is induced mainly via MCH-1R [see Genomics, Vol. 79, 785 (2002)]. Because MCH-1R gene-deficient mice chronically administered with MCH do not develop polyphagy or obesity, it is known that controlling of energy metabolism by MCH is induced via MCH-1R. Furthermore, the deficiency of MCH-1R is known to promote the activity amount of mice [see Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 99, 3240 (2002)], and its participation in central system diseases accompanied by behavioral disorders, for example, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, depression and the like also is strongly suggested [see Molecular Medicine Today, Vol. 6, 43 (2000); Trends in Neuroscience, Vol. 24, 527 (2001)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also reported that an autoantibody to MCH-1R is present in serum of vitiligo vulgaris patients [see The Journal of Clinical Investigation, Vol. 109, 923 (2002)]. Furthermore, expression of MCH-1R in certain species of cancer cells was reported, and in vivo MCH and MCH-1R expression sites also suggest MCH's participation in cancer, sleep, vigil, drug dependence and digestive disorders [see Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, Vol. 289, 44 (2001); Neuroendocrinology, Vol. 61, 348 (1995); Endocrinology, Vol. 137, 561 (1996); The Journal of Comparative Neurology, Vol. 435, 26 (2001)].\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFunctions of MCH are expressed upon its binding to MCH receptors. Therefore, when its binding to MCH receptor is inhibited, then expression of MCH action can be inhibited. In consequence, substances which are antagonists for binding of MCH with its receptor are expected to be useful as preventive or remedy for those various diseases in which MCH participates, for example, metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, hormone disorder, hyperlipidemia, gout, fatty liver, etc.; cardiovascular disorders such as stenocardia, acute/congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary atherosclerosis, renal diseases, electrolyte abnormality, etc.; central and peripheral nervous system disorders such as bulimia, emotional disturbance, depression, anxiety, epilepsy, delirium, dementia, schizophrenia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, memory impairment, sleep disorders, cognitive failure, dyskinesia, paresthesias, smell disorders, morphine tolerance, drug dependence, alcoholism, etc.; reproductive disorders such as infertility, preterm labor, sexual dysfunction, etc.; and other digestive disorders, respiratory disorders, cancer or pigmentation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs compounds having an MCH receptor-antagonistic effect, for example, Non-Patent Reference 1 discloses compounds having 3,4-methylenedioxybenzyl bonding to the 1-position of a piperidine skeleton; and Patent Reference 1 and Patent Reference 2 disclose derivatives having naphthylmethyl bonding to the 1-position of a piperidine skeleton.\n\n\n \nNon-Patent

INVENTION\n\n\nTechnical Problems\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present inventors have assiduously studied compounds having an MCH receptor-antagonistic effect and, as a result, have found that a 5/5-membered or 5/6-membered condensed ring cycloalkylamine derivative having a 5/5-membered or 5/6-membered bicyclic heteroaryl ring bonding to the 1-position of a piperidine ring via methylene and having a specific

Cancer cells are often characterized by constitutive proliferative signals, defects in cell cycle checkpoints, as well as defects in apoptotic pathways. There is a great need for the development of new chemotherapeutic drugs that can block cell proliferation and enhance apoptosis of tumor cells.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConventional therapeutic agents used to treat cancer include taxanes and vinca alkaloids, which target microtubules. Microtubules are an integral structural element of the mitotic spindle, which is responsible for the distribution of the duplicated sister chromatids to each of the daughter cells that result from cell division. Disruption of microtubules or interference with microtubule dynamics can inhibit cell division and induce apoptosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, microtubules are also important structural elements in non-proliferative cells. For example, they are required for organelle and vesicle transport within the cell or along axons. Since microtubule-targeted drugs do not discriminate between these different structures, they can have undesirable side effects that limit usefulness and dosage. There is a need for chemotherapeutic agents with improved specificity to avoid side effects and improve efficacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMicrotubules rely on two classes of motor proteins, the kinesins and dyneins, for their function. Kinesins are motor proteins that generate motion along microtubules. They are characterized by a conserved motor domain, which is approximately 320 amino acids in length. The motor domain binds and hydrolyses ATP as an energy source to drive directional movement of cellular cargo along microtubules and also contains the microtubule binding interface (Mandelkow and Mandelkow, Trends Cell Biol. 2002, 12:585-591).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinesins exhibit a high degree of functional diversity, and several kinesins are specifically required during mitosis and cell division. Different mitotic kinesins are involved in all aspects of mitosis, including the formation of a bipolar spindle, spindle dynamics, and chromosome movement. Thus, interference with the function of mitotic kinesins can disrupt normal mitosis and block cell division. Specifically, the mitotic kinesin KSP (also termed EG5), which is required for centrosome separation, was shown to have an essential function during mitosis. Cells in which KSP function is inhibited arrest in mitosis with unseparated centrosomes (Blangy et al., Cell 1995, 83:1159-1169). This leads to the formation of a monoastral array of microtubules, at the end of which the duplicated chromatids are attached in a rosette-like configuration. Further, this mitotic arrest leads to growth inhibition of tumor cells (Kaiser et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n1999, 274:18925-18931). Inhibitors of KSP would be desirable for the treatment of proliferative diseases, such as cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinesin inhibitors are known, and several molecules have recently been described in the literature. For example, adociasulfate-2 inhibits the microtubule-stimulated ATPase activity of several kinesins, including CEINIP-E (Sakowitz et al., \nScience \n1998, 280:292-295). Rose Bengal lactone, another non-selective inhibitor, interferes with kinesin function by blocking the microtubule binding site (Hopkins et al., Biochemistry 2000, 39:2805-2814). Monastrol, a compound that has been isolated using a phenotypic screen, is a selective inhibitor of the KSP motor domain (Mayer et al., Science 1999, 286:971-974). Treatment of cells with monastrol arrests cells in mitosis with monopolar spindles.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKSP inhibitors have been disclosed in patents or publications, including: WO2006/031348, WO2006/110390, WO2006/068933, WO2006/023083, WO2006/007491, WO2006/086358, WO2003/105855, WO2006/023440, WO2003/079973, WO2004/087050, WO2004/111193, WO2004/112699, WO2006/007497, WO2006/101761, WO2006/007496, WO2005/017190, WO0224/037171, WO2005/019205, WO2005/019206, WO2005/102996, WO2006/101780, WO2006/007501, WO2005/018547, WO2004/058148, WO2004/058700, WO2005/018638, WO2007/054138, WO2006/133805, WO2006/002726, WO2006/133821, WO2005/108355, WO2006/094602, WO2005/092011, WO2006/031607, WO2004/111023, WO2006/137490, WO2006/101102, WO2006/101103, WO2006/101104, WO2006/101105, WO2004/092147, WO2005/035512, WO2006/044825, WO2006/044825, WO2006/119146, US2006/0247178, WO2006/098961, WO2006/098962, US2006/0258699, US2007/0213380, US2007/0112044, US2007/0155804, US2008/0194653, WO2008/042928, US2007/0249636, US2007/0287703, US2008/0153854, and US2007/0037853.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKSP, as well as other mitotic kinesins, are attractive targets for the discovery of novel chemotherapeutics with anti-proliferative activity. There is a need for compounds useful in the inhibition of KSP, and in the treatment of proliferative diseases, such as cancer.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the

present invention provides processes for producing the compounds described in each of the various embodiments above, pharmaceutical formulations or compositions comprising one or more of such compounds, and methods of treating or preventing one or more conditions or diseases associated with KSP kinesin activity such as those discussed in detail below.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used above, and throughout the specification, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Subject” includes both mammals and non-mammalian animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Mammal” includes humans and other mammalian animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “substituted” means that one or more hydrogens on the designated atom is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valency under the existing circumstances is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. By “stable compound” or “stable structure” is meant a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “optionally substituted” means optional substitution with the specified groups, radicals or moieties. It should be noted that any atom with unsatisfied valences in the text, schemes, examples and tables herein is assumed to have the hydrogen atom(s) to satisfy the valences.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following definitions apply regardless of whether a term is used by itself or in combination with other terms, unless otherwise indicated. Therefore, the definition of “alkyl” applies to “alkyl” as well as the “alkyl” portions of “hydroxyalkyl”, “haloalkyl”, “alkoxy”, etc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Alkyl” means an aliphatic hydrocarbon group which may be straight or branched and comprising about 1 to about 20 carbon atoms in the chain. Preferred alkyl groups contain about 1 to about 12 carbon atoms in the chain. More preferred alkyl groups contain about 1 to about 6 carbon atoms in the chain.

Pharmaceutical Sci., \n93(3) 601-611 (2004) describe the preparation of the solvates of the antifungal fluconazole in ethyl acetate as well as from water. Similar preparations of solvates, hemisolvate, hydrates and the like are described by E. C. van Tonder et al, \nAAPS PharmSciTech., \n5(1), article 12 (2004); and A. L. Bingham et al, \nChem. Commun., \n603-604 (2001). A typical, non-limiting, process involves dissolving the inventive compound in desired amounts of the desired solvent (organic or water or mixtures thereof) at a higher than ambient temperature, and cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals which are then isolated by standard methods. Analytical techniques such as, for example I. R. spectroscopy, show the presence of the solvent (or water) in the crystals as a solvate (or hydrate).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can form salts which are also within the scope of this invention. Reference to a compound of the invention herein is understood to include reference to salts thereof, unless otherwise indicated.

In addition, when a compound of any one of the invention contains both a basic moiety, such as, but not limited to a pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety, such as, but not limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions (“inner salts”) may be formed and are included within the term “salt(s)” as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful. Salts of the compounds of the The invention may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of the invention with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary acid addition salts include acetates, ascorbates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates, fumarates, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, hydroiodides, lactates, maleates, methanesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates, nitrates, oxalates, phosphates, propionates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates, federates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates (also known as tosylates,) and the like. Additionally, acids which are generally considered suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically useful salts from basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, for example, by P. Stahl of al, Camille G. (eds.) \nHandbook of Pharmaceutical Salts. Properties, Selection and Use\n. (2002) Zurich: Wiley-VCH; S. Berge et al, \nJournal of Pharmaceutical Sciences \n(1977) 66(1) 1-19; P. Gould, \nInternational J. of Pharmaceutics \n(1986) 33 201-217; Anderson et al, \nThe Practice of Medicinal Chemistry \n(1996), Academic Press, New York; and in \nThe Orange Book \n(Food & Drug Administration, Washington, D.C. on their website). These disclosures are incorporated herein by reference thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases (for example, organic amines) such as dicyclohexylamines, t-butyl amines, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quarternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g. methyl, ethyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g. dimethyl, diethyl, and dibutyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g. decyl, lauryl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g. benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll such acid salts and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable esters of the compounds of the invention include the following groups: (1) carboxylic acid esters obtained by esterification of the hydroxy groups, in which the non-carbonyl moiety of the carboxylic acid portion of the ester grouping is selected from straight or branched chain alkyl (for example, acetyl, n-propyl, t-butyl, or n-butyl), alkoxyalkyl (for example, methoxymethyl), aralkyl (for example, benzyl), aryloxyalkyl (for example, phenoxymethyl), aryl (for example, phenyl optionally substituted with, for example, halogen, C\n1-4\nalkyl, or C\n1-4\nalkoxy or amino); (2) sulfonate esters, such as alkyl- or aralkylsulfonyl (for example, methanesulfonyl); (3) amino acid esters (for example, L-valyl or L-isoleucyl); (4) phosphonate esters and (5) mono-, di- or triphosphate esters. The phosphate esters may be further esterified by, for example, a C\n1-20 \nalcohol or reactive derivative thereof, or by a 2,3-di (C\n6-24\n)acyl glycerol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of The invention, and salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs thereof, may exist in their tautomeric form (for example, as an amide or imino ether). All such tautomeric forms are contemplated herein as part of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of Formula (I) may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and, therefore, exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula (I) as well as mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. In addition, the present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example, if a compound of Formula (I) incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDiastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of Formula (I) may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of chiral HPLC column.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also possible that the compounds of Formula (I) may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are included in the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll stereoisomers (for example, geometric isomers, optical isomers and the like) of the compounds of the invention (including those of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs of the compounds as well as the salts, solvates and esters of the prodrugs), such as those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on various substituents, including enantiomeric forms (which may exist even in the absence of asymmetric carbons), rotameric forms, atropisomers, and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention, as are positional isomers (such as, for example, 4-pyridyl and 3-pyridyl). (For example, if a compound of Formula (I) incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are included in the invention.) Individual stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention may, for example, be substantially free of other isomers, or may be admixed, for example, as racemates or with all other, or other selected, stereoisomers. The chiral centers of the present invention can have the S or R configuration as defined by the \nIUPAC \n1974 Recommendations. The use of the terms “salt”, “solvate”, “ester”, “prodrug” and the like, is intended to equally apply to the salt, solvate, ester and prodrug of enantiomers, stereoisomers, rotamers, tautomers, positional isomers, racemates or prodrugs of the inventive compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also embraces isotopically-labelled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine and chlorine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, and \n36\nCl, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula (I) (e.g., those labeled with \n3\nH and \n14\nC) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., \n3\nH) and carbon-14 (i.e., \n14\nC) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of Formula (I) can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples hereinbelow, by substituting an appropriate isotopically labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPolymorphic forms of the compounds of the invention, and of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs of the compounds of the invention, are intended to be included in the present invention.\n\n\n \nPREPARATIVE EXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \nGenerally, the compounds of the invention can be prepared by a variety of methods well known to those skilled in the art, for example, by the methods as outlined in the general scheme below and in the examples that follow. The examples should not be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure. Alternative mechanistic pathways and analogous structures will be apparent to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEC\n50 \nvalues for the exemplified compounds appearing in the Table below are indicated according to the following ranges:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA—≦500 nM\n\n\n \n \n \n \nB—>500 nM\n\n\n \n \n \n \nC—>500 nM to ≦1000 nM\n\n\n \n \n \n \nD—>1000 nM\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following abbreviations are used in the procedures and schemes:\n\n \n \n \nACN Acetonitrile\n \nAcOH Acetic acid\n \nAq Aqueous\n \nBOC tert-Butoxycarbonyl\n \nBOC-ON [2-(tert-butoxycarbonyloxyimino)-2-phenylacetonitrile]\n \nBOC\n2\nO BOC Anhydride\n \nC degrees Celsius\n \nCpd Compound\n \nCBZCl Benzyl chloroformate\n \nDCM Dichloromethane\n \nDEAD Diethyl azodicarboxylate\n \nDIAD Diisopropylazodicarboxylate\n \nDIEA Diisopropylethylamine\n \nDMA N,N-Dimethylacetamide\n \nDMAP 4-N,N-Dimethylaminopyridine\n \nDME Dimethoxyethane\n \nDMF Dimethylformamide\n \nDMSO Dimethyl sulfoxide\n \nEDCl 1-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride\n \nEl Electron ionization\n \nEq Equivalents\n \nEtOAc Ethyl acetate\n \nEtOH Ethanol\n \ng grams\n \nh. hours\n \n \n1\nH proton\n \nHATU N,N,N′,N′-Tetramethyl-O-(7-Azabenzotriazol-1-yl)Uronium hexafluorophosphate\n \nHex hexanes\n \nHOBT 1-Hydroxybenzotriazole\n \nHPLC High pressure liquid chromatography\n \nKSP Kinesin spindle protein\n \nLAH Lithium aluminum hydride\n \nLDA Lithium diisopropylamide\n \nLHMDS Lithium hexamethyldisilylamide\n \nM Molar\n \nmmol milimolar\n \nmCPBA meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid\n \nMe Methyl\n \nMeCN Acetonitrile\n \nMeOH Methanol\n \nmin Minutes\n \nmg Milligrams\n \nMHZ Megahertz\n \nmL Milliliter\n \nMPLC Medium Pressure Liquid Chromatography\n \nNMR Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\n \nMS Mass Spectroscopy\n \nNBS N-Bromosuccinimide\n \nNIS N-Iodosuccinimide\n \nNMM N-Methylmorpholine\n \nNMP 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone\n \nON Overnight\n \nPCC Pyridinium Chlorochromate\n \nPTLC Preparative thin layer chromatography\n \nPyr Pyridine\n \nRT Room temperature\n \nsgc Silica gel 60 chromatography\n \ntBOC tert-Butoxycarbonyl\n \nTEA Triethylamine\n \nTFA Trifluoroacetic acid\n \nTHF Tetrahydrofuran\n \nTLC Thin layer chromatography\n \nt\nR \nRetention time\n \n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nExample 101\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPart A:\n\n\n \n \n \nTo an ice-cooled solution of 2,5-difluorobenzoyl chloride 101A (1.0 g, 5.66 mmol) in DCM (7 mL) was added tert butyl carbazate (898 mg, 6.79 mmol) followed by the drop-wise addition of DIEA (1.47 mL, 8.49 mmol).

The precipitate was filtered off, and toward the filtrate at 0° C. was added slowly 4 N HCl in dioxane (100 mL, 0.4 mol). Large amount of precipitate was formed, which was removed by filtration. The solution was then concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation, affording compound 800D as a yellow solid (48.5 g, 77%). \n1\nH NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d\n6\n) δ 7.31-7.28 (m, 3H).\n\n\n \nPart D:\n\n\n \n \n \nLHMDS (1M in THF) (33.1 mL, 33.11 mmol) was added dropwise at −78° C. under argon atmosphere to a solution of 6-fluorochroman-2-one 801A (5 g, 30.1 mmol) in 30 mL of THF.

The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and sirred for 1 hour. The volatiles were removed in vacuo, and the resulting acid chloride used as crude 1901B in the next step.\n\n\n \nPart B:\n\n\n \n \n \nA solution of compound 1901B (6.4 mmol) in DCM (5 mL) was slowly added to an ice-cooled stirring mixture of compound 801C from example 801 (1.75 g, 4.28 mmol) and pyridine (1.04 mL, 12.83 mmol) in DCM (10 mL). The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 16 hours. Product formation was confirmed by LC-MS. The reaction mixture was quenched by the addition of 1 N HCl, and extracted with DCM. Drying over magnesium sulfate and purification by flash silica chromatography, gradient elution (0 to 100%) petroleum ether/DCM/ethyl acetate afforded diastereomeric separation of compound 1901C (1.5 g, 71%).

As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, mitosis may be altered in a variety of ways, such as by increasing or decreasing the activity of a component in the mitotic pathway or by disturbing equilibrium (e.g., by inhibiting or activating certain components).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating or preventing a disease associated with KSP activity in a subject in need thereof comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof to said subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be used to inhibit mitotic spindle formation, thus causing prolonged cell cycle arrest in mitosis. “Inhibit” in this context means decreasing or interfering with mitotic spindle formation or causing mitotic spindle dysfunction. “Mitotic spindle formation” means the organization of microtubules into bipolar structures by mitotic kinesins. “Mitotic spindle dysfunction” means mitotic arrest and monopolar spindle formation.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be useful for binding to, and/or inhibiting the activity of, KSP. In one embodiment, the KSP is human KSP. In one embodiment, such KSP activity is inhibited in vitro, in vivo (e.g., in a patient in need thereof), or ex vivo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn other embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be used to bind to or inhibit the activity of KSP kinesins from non-human organisms. In this context, “inhibit” means increasing or decreasing spindle pole separation, causing malformation, i.e., splaying, of mitotic spindle poles, or otherwise causing morphological perturbation of the mitotic spindle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso included within the definition of KSP for purposes of the present invention are variants and/or fragments of KSP (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,437,115).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can be used to treat diseases associated with or caused by aberrant cellular proliferation. Such disease states include, but are not limited to, cancer (further discussed below), hyperplasia, cardiac hypertrophy, autoimmune diseases, fungal disorders, arthritis, graft rejection, inflammatory bowel disease, immune disorders, inflammation, cellular proliferation induced after medical procedures, including, but not limited to, surgery, angioplasty, and the like. Treatment includes inhibiting cellular proliferation. It is appreciated that in some cases the cells may not be in an abnormally proliferative state and yet require treatment. For example, during wound healing, the cells may be proliferating “normally”, but inhibition of cellular proliferation may be desired. Thus, in one embodiment, the invention herein includes application to cells or subjects afflicted with or subject to impending affliction with any one of these conditions, disorders or states.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “treating cancer” and “treatment—of cancer” refer to administration to a mammal afflicted with a cancerous condition and to an effect that alleviates the cancerous condition by killing at least some of the cancerous cells, and also to an effect that results in the inhibition of growth and/or metastasis of the cancer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDue to their KSP inhibitory action, the compounds, compositions and methods provided herein are useful fOr the treatment of a wide variety of cancers. Non-limiting examples of such cancers include solid tumors and hematological cancers, such as those of the skin, breast, brain, colon, gall bladder, thyroid, cervical carcinomas, testicles, and blood.

Chemoprevention is defined as inhibiting the development of invasive cancer by either blocking the initiating mutagenic event or by blocking the progression of pre-malignant cells that have already suffered an insult. The compounds of the present invention may also be useful in inhibiting cancer relapse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also be useful in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and metastasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention may also be useful as antifungal agents, by modulating the activity of the fungal members of the bimC kinesin subgroup, as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,284,480.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor each of the foregoing embodiments, the amount of the at least one compound of the invention administered is preferably an effective amount for the intended purpose. The phrase “effective amount” means that amount of a compound of the invention, and other pharmacological or therapeutic agents described herein, that will elicit a biological or medical response of a tissue, a cell, a population of cells (e.g., a population of aberrantly proliferating cells such as cancer cells or psioratic cells), a system, or a subject (e.g., animal or human) that is being sought by the administrator (such as a researcher, doctor or veterinarian) which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the condition or disease being treated and the prevention, slowing or halting of progression of one or more cellular proliferation diseases. “Therapeutically effective amount” means effective amount where the purpose includes a therapeutic purpose, such as in a human or non-human patient in need of treatment. The formulations or compositions, combinations and treatments of the present invention can be administered by any suitable means which produce contact of these compounds with the site of action in the targeted population of aberrantly proliferating cells or the body of the subject being treated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable dosage ranges for the various embodiments of the invention are readily determined by those skilled in the art and depend upon intended use. Suitable dose ranges include from about 0.001 to about 500 mg/kg of body weight/day of a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or prodrug (etc.) thereof. Another suitable dosage ranges from about 0.01 to about 25 mg/kg of body weight/day. For administration of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the above compounds, the weights indicated above refer to the weight of the acid equivalent or the base equivalent of the therapeutic compound derived from the salt.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt may be preferable to administer KSP kinesin inhibitors which can specifically inhibit KSP kinesin activity at low concentrations, for example, those that cause a level of inhibition of 50% or greater at a concentration of 50 μM or less, 100 nM or less, or 50 nM or less. The administration of such compounds of the invention represents various embodiments of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompositions\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn some embodiments, the at least one compound of the invention is administered as the neat chemical. In other embodiments, the compounds of the invention are administered as a pharmaceutical composition. Thus, pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of the invention are within the scope of the present invention. Such pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise at least one compound of the invention (e.g., doses of one, two, three, or more different compounds of the invention), together with one or more acceptable carriers, and optionally other therapeutic agents. Each carrier (including, e.g., adjuvants or vehicles) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not injurious to the intended purpose or, in the case of therapy, the subject being treated. Accordingly, in another embodiment, this invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, ester, prodrug, or isomer thereof and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds described by this invention, inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, dispersible granules, capsules, cachets and suppositories. The powders and tablets may be comprised of from about 5 to about 95 percent active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers are known in the art, e.g., magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar or lactose. Tablets, powders, cachets and capsules can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and methods of manufacture for various compositions may be found in A. Gennaro (ed.), \nRemington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, \n18\nth \nEdition, (1990), Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term pharmaceutical composition is also intended to encompass both the bulk composition and individual dosage units comprised of more than one (e.g., two) pharmaceutically active agents such as, for example, a compound of the present invention and an additional agent selected from the lists of the additional agents described herein, along with any pharmaceutically inactive excipients. The bulk composition and each individual dosage unit can contain fixed amounts of the afore-said “more than one pharmaceutically active agents”. The bulk composition is material that has not yet been formed into individual dosage units. An illustrative dosage unit is an oral dosage unit such as tablets, pills and the like. Similarly, the herein-described method of treating a subject by administering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is also intended to encompass the administration of the afore-said bulk composition and individual dosage units.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, the compositions of the present invention may be formulated in sustained release form to provide the rate controlled release of any one or more of the components or active ingredients to optimize the therapeutic effects.

Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may also be deliverable transdermally. The transdermal compositions can take the form of creams, lotions, aerosols and/or emulsions and can be included in a transdermal patch of the matrix or reservoir type as are conventional in the art for this purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the at least one compound or composition of the invention is formulated for subcutaneous administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the at least one compound or composition of the invention is formulated for oral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the at least one compound or composition of the invention is formulated for parenteral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the at least one compound or composition of the invention is formulated for intravenous administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the pharmaceutical preparation is provided in a unit dosage form. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into suitably sized unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component, e.g., an effective amount to achieve the desired purpose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs stated elsewhere herein, the quantity of active compound in a unit dose of preparation may be varied or adjusted to suit intended purpose. Additional non-limiting examples of such doses range from about 1 mg to about 100 mg, alternatively from about 1 mg to about 50 mg, or alternatively from about 1 mg to about 25 mg, according to the particular application.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe actual dosage employed may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient and the severity of the condition being treated. Determination of the proper dosage regimen for a particular situation is within the skill of the art. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day as required.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe amount and frequency of administration of the compounds of the invention and/or the pharMaceutically acceptable saltS or esters thereof will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated. A typical recommended daily dosage regimen for oral administration can range from about 1 mg/day to about 500 mg/day, preferably 1 mg/day to 200 mg/day, in two to four divided doses.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a kit comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or vehicle, and, optionally, inserts and/or labels which include instructions for use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides a kit comprising an amount of at least one compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof and an amount of at least one additional therapeutic agent listed above, wherein the amounts of the two or more ingredients result in desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides for: the use of at least one compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, ester or prodrug thereof, to manufacture a medicament for inhibiting KSP kinesin activity in a subject in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides for: the use of at least one compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, ester or prodrug thereof, to manufacture a medicament for treating one or more diseases by inhibiting KSP kinesin activity in a patient in need thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides for: the use of at least one compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, ester or prodrug thereof, to manufacture a medicament for treating any one of the conditions, disease, or disorders described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides for: the use of a combination comprising (i) at least one compound of the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, ester or prodrug thereof; and (ii) at least one second active ingredient described herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombination Therapies\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention (and the compositions comprising at least one compound of the invention) are also useful in combination with one or more therapeutic agents other than a compound of the invention.

These include inhibitors of EGFR (for example gefitinib and erlotinib), antibodies to EGFR (for example C225), inhibitors of ERB-2 (for example trastuzumab), inhibitors of IGFR, inhibitors of cytokine receptors, inhibitors of MET, inhibitors of PI3K (for example LY294002), serine/threonine kinases (including but not limited to inhibitors of Akt such as described in WO 02/083064, WO 02/083139, WO 02/083140 and WO 02/083138), inhibitors of Raf kinase (for example BAY-43-9006), inhibitors of MEK (for example CI-1040 and PD-098059), inhibitors of mTOR (for example Wyeth CCI-779), and inhibitors of C-abl kinase (for example GLEEVEC™, Novartis Pharmaceuticals). Additional kinase inhibitors include those that inhibit proteins involved in the cell cycle. These include Aurora kinase inhibitors, CDK inhibitors (e.g., flavopiridol, CYC202, BMS387032 and polo-like kinase inhibitors.) These also include agents that interfere with cell cycle checkpoints and thereby sensitize cancer cells to DNA damaging agents. Such agents include, e.g., inhibitors of ART, ATM, Chk1 and Chk2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also encompasses combinations with NSAID's which are selective COX-2 inhibitors. For purposes of this specification NSAID's which are selective inhibitors of COX-2 are defined as those which possess a specificity for inhibiting COX-2 over COX-1 of at least 100 fold as measured by the ratio of IC50 for COX-2 over IC50 for COX-1 evaluated by cell or microsomal assays. Inhibitors of COX-2 that are particularly useful in the instant method of treatment are: 3-phenyl-4-(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-2-(5H)—furanone; and 5-chloro-3-(4-methylsulfonyl)phenyl-2-(2-methyl-5 pyridinyl)pyridine; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds that have been described as specific inhibitors of COX-2 and are therefore useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, parecoxib, CELIEBREX® and BEXTRA® or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n“Integrin blockers” refers to compounds which selectively antagonize, inhibit or counteract binding of a physiological ligand to the α\nv\nβ\n3 \nintegrin, to compounds which selectively antagonize, inhibit or counteract binding of a physiological ligand to the α\nv\nβ\n5 \nintegrin, to compounds which antagonize, inhibit or counteract binding of a physiological ligand to both the α\nv\nβ\n3 \nintegrin and the α\nv\nβ\n5 \nintegrin, and to compounds which antagonize, inhibit or counteract the activity of the particular integrin(s) expressed on capillary endothelial cells. The term also refers to antagonists of the α\nv\nβ\n6\n, α\nv\nβ\n8\n, α\n1\nβ\n1\n, α\n2\nβ\n1\n, α\n5\nβ\n1\n, α\n6\nβ\n1 \nand α\n6\nβ\n4 \nintegrins. The term also refers to antagonists of any combination of α\nv\nβ\n3\n, α\nv\nβ\n5\n, α\nv\nβ\n6\n, α\nv\nβ\n8\n, α\n1\nβ\n1\n, β\n2\nβ\n1\n, β\n5\nβ\n1\n, α\n6\nβ\n1 \nand α\n6\nβ\n4 \nintegrins.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCombinations with compounds other than anti-cancer compounds are also encompassed in the instant methods. For example, combinations of the compounds of the invention with PPAR-γ (i.e., PPAR-gamma) agonists and PPAR-δ (i.e., PPAR-delta) agonists (collectively “PPAR agonists”) are useful in the treatment of certain malingnancies. PPAR-γ and PPAR-δ are the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ and δ, respectively. The expression of PPAR-γ on endothelial cells and its involvement in angiogenesis has been reported in the literature (see \nJ. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. \n1998; 31:909-913\n; J. Biol. Chem. \n1999; 274:9116-9121\n; Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. \n2000; 41:2309-2317). More recently, PPAR-γ agonists have been shown to inhibit the angiogenic response to VEGF in vitro; both troglitazone and rosiglitazone maleate inhibit the development of retinal neovascularization in mice (\nArch. Ophthamol. \n2001; 119:709-717). Examples of PPAR-γ agonists and PPAR-γ/α agonists include, but are not limited to, thiazolidinediones (such as DRF2725, CS-011, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone), fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, clofibrate, GW2570, SB219994, AR-H039242, JTT-501, MCC-555, GW2331, GW409544, NN2344, KRP297, NP0110, DRF4158, NN622, GI262570, PNU182716, DRF552926, 2-[(5,7-dipropyl-3-trifluoromethyl-1,2-benzisoxazol-6-yl)oxy]-2-methylpropionic acid, and 2(R)-7-(3-(2-chloro-4-(4-fluorophenoxy)phenoxy)propoxy)—2-ethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can also be administered in combination with one or more inhibitor of inherent multidrug resistance (MDR), in particular MDR associated with high levels of expression of transporter proteins. Such MDR inhibitors include inhibitors of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), such as LY335979, XR9576; OC144-093, R101922, VX853 and PSC833 (valspodar).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional anticancer agents also include hypoxia activatable agents (e.g., tirapazamine), proteasome inhibitors (e.g., lactacystin and bortezomib), ubiquitin inhibitors, HDM2 inhibitors, TNF activators, BUB-R inhibitors, CENP-E inhibitors, and interferon alpha.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention can also be employed in conjunction with one or more anti-emetic agents to treat nausea or emesis, including acute, delayed, late-phase, and anticipatory emesis, which may result from the use of a compound of the present invention, alone or with radiation therapy. For the prevention or treatment of emesis, a compound of the present invention may be used in conjunction with one or more other anti-emetic agents, especially neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, 5HT3 receptor, antagonists, such as ondansetron, granisetron, tropisetron, and zatisetron, GABAB receptor agonists, such as baclofen, a corticosteroid such as Decadron (dexamethasone), Kenalog, Aristocort, Nasalide, Preferid, Benecorten or those as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,789,118, 2,990,401, 3,048,581, 3,126,375, 3,929,768, 3,996,359, 3,928,326 and 3,749,712, an antidopaminergic, such as the phenothiazines (for example prochlorperazine, fluphenazine, thioridazine and mesoridazine), metoclopramide or dronabinol. In one embodiment, an anti-emesis agent selected from a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, a 5HT3 receptor antagonist and a corticosteroid is administered as an adjuvant for the treatment or prevention of emesis that may result upon administration of the compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists that can be used in conjunction with the compounds of the invention are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,162,339, 5,232,929, 5,242,930, 5,373,003, 5,387,595, 5,459,270, 5,494,926, 5,496,833, 5,637,699, and 5,719,147, content of which are incorporated herein by reference. In an embodiment, the neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist for use in conjunction with the compounds of the present invention is selected from: 2-(R)-(1-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoronnethyl)phenyl)ethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(3-(5-oxo-1H,4H-1,2,4-triazolo)methyl)morpholine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,719,147.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA compound of the present invention may also be administered with one or more immunologic-enhancing drug, such as for example, levamisole, isoprinosine and Zadaxin.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs described above, the present invention includes combinations comprising an amount of at least one compound (or a composition comprising a compound) of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, and an amount of one or more additional therapeutic agents listed above (adminiitered together or sequentially) wherein the amounts of the compounds/treatments result in desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWhen administering a combination therapy to a patient in need of such administration, the therapeutic agents in the combination, or a pharmaceutical composition or compositions comprising the therapeutic agents, may be administered in any order such as, for example, sequentially, concurrently, together, simultaneously and the like. The amounts of the various actives in such combination therapy may be different amounts (different dosage amounts) or same amounts (same dosage amounts). Thus, for illustration purposes, a compound of the invention and an additional therapeutic agent may be present in fixed amounts (dosage amounts) in a single dosage unit (e.g., a capsule, a tablet and the like). A commercial example of such single dosage unit containing fixed amounts of two different active compounds is VYTORIN® (available from Merck Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals, Kenilworth, N.J.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf formulated as a fixed dose, such combination products employ the compounds of this invention within the dosage range described herein and the other pharmaceutically active agent or treatment within its dosage range. Compounds of the invention may also be administered sequentially with known therapeutic agents when a combination formulation is inappropriate. The invention is not limited in the sequence of administration; compounds of the invention may be administered either prior to or after administration of the known therapeutic agent. Such techniques are within the skills of persons skilled in the art as well as attending physicians.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes could be made to the embodiments described above without departing from the broad inventive concept thereof. It is understood, therefore, that this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments disclosed, but it is intended to cover modifications that are within the spirit and scope of the invention, as defined by the appended claims."
