Description\n\n\n\n\nAPPLICATION DATA\n\n\n \n \n \nThis application claims benefit to U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/148,693 filed Jan. 30, 2009.\n\n\n \nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention relates to small molecule inhibitors which are useful in treating various diseases and conditions involving Chymase.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn cardiac tissue of cardiomyopathic patients, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), which has been demonstrated to stimulate cardiac fibrosis in animal models (Kuwahara, et al. Circulation, 2002, 106, 130), is increased (Li et al., Circulation, 1997, 96, 874). In the myocardial fibrotic area, it is known that mast cells are increased in number and may contribute to the development of fibroblast proliferation in cardiac tissues of patients with cardiomyopathy (Patella et al., Circulation, 1998, 97, 971). Chymase is a chymotrypsin-like serine protease contained in the secretory granules of mast cells. Although the precise physiological roles of Chymase have not been completely revealed, Chymase is known to transform angiotensin I to angiotensin II and may contribute to activation of TGF-β, matrix proteases, and cytokines (Taipale et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, 4689; Takai et al., Life Sci., 1996, 58, 591; Takai et al., Circulation, 1999, 100, 654).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA potent and selective Chymase inhibitor may have potential use as a treatment of chronic heart failure, atherosclerosis, restenosis, and myocardial infarction by inhibiting local production of angiotensin II in the heart and release of TGF-β, two independent mediators of cardiac remodeling. An inhibitor may also have potential use for treatment of mast cell mediated diseases such as dermatitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary inflammation, since Chymase is implicated in microvascular leakage, neutrophil accumulation, the stimulation of mucus secretion, and the modulation of cytokines (He et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1998, 352, 91).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral small molecule Chymase inhibitors have been reported to be efficacious in the cardiomyopathic hamster model of heart failure (Takai et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003, 305, 17), in carotid artery injury by a balloon catheter in dogs (Takai et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther, 2003, 304, 841), and in the hamster left anterior descending coronary artery ligation model of heart failure (WO 03/018061). Additionally, a Chymase inhibitor has been demonstrated to be efficacious in a sheep asthma model (WO 2005/073214). PCT application PCT/US2008/072849 and the present application are commonly owned by the assignee of this application and discloses quinazolinedione useful as Chymase inhibitors.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIt is therefore an object of the invention to provide a small molecule a Chymase inhibitor as defined herein, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also an object of the invention to provide methods of using said Chymase inhibitors to treat various diseases and conditions related thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is a further object of the invention to provide processes of preparing said Chymase inhibitors.\n\n\n \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIn a first generic embodiment, there is provided a compound of the formula

Then the mixture is cooled to room temperature and 91 mg of glycine methylester hydrochloride is added and the resulting mixture is stirred for 30 min at 55° C. and 1 h at room temperature. Then the solvent is removed under vacuum and the residue is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to give 100 mg (66%) of [(3-amino-pyridine-4-carbonyl)-amino]-acetic acid methyl ester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo a solution of 100 mg of [(3-amino-pyridine-4-carbonyl)-amino]-acetic acid methyl ester in tetrahydrofuran (4.5 mL) is added 194 mg of 1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole and 0.18 mL of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene at room temperature and the mixture is stirred at the same temperature for 2 h. Then the solvent is removed under vacuum and the residue is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to give 100 mg (89%) of (2,4-dioxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)-acetic acid methyl ester.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo a solution of 62 mg of (2,4-dioxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)-acetic acid methyl ester in N,N-dimethylformamide (2.5 mL) is added 109 mg of (1,4-dimethyl-1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)-trimethylammonium iodide and 44 mg of potassium carbonate at room temperature.

Compounds of the invention may be physically combined with the conventional therapeutics or other adjuvants into a single pharmaceutical composition. Advantageously, the compounds may then be administered together in a single dosage form. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions comprising such combinations of compounds contain at least about 5%, but more preferably at least about 20%, of a compound (w/w) or a combination thereof. The optimum percentage (w/w) of a compound of the invention may vary and is within the purview of those skilled in the art. Alternatively, the compounds may be administered separately (either serially or in parallel). Separate dosing allows for greater flexibility in the dosing regime.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, dosage forms of the above-described compounds include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and adjuvants known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These carriers and adjuvants include, for example, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, buffer substances, water, salts or electrolytes and cellulose-based substances. Preferred dosage forms include, tablet, capsule, caplet, liquid, solution, suspension, emulsion, lozenges, syrup, reconstitutable powder, granule, suppository and transdermal patch. Methods for preparing such dosage forms are known (see, for example, H. C. Ansel and N. G. Popovish, \nPharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, \n5th ed., Lea and Febiger (1990)). Dosage levels and requirements are well-recognized in the art and may be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art from available methods and techniques suitable for a particular patient. In some embodiments, dosage levels range from about 1-1000 mg/dose for a 70 kg patient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlthough one dose per day may be sufficient, up to 5 doses per day may be given. For oral doses, up to 2000 mg/day may be required. As the skilled artisan will appreciate, lower or higher doses may be required depending on particular factors. For instance, specific dosage and treatment regimens will depend on factors such as the patient's general health profile, the severity and course of the patient's disorder or disposition thereto, and the judgment of the treating physician.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “patient” includes both human and non-human mammals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “effective amount” means an amount of a compound according to the invention which, in the context of which it is administered or used, is sufficient to achieve the desired effect or result. Depending on the context, the term effective amount may include or be synonymous with a pharmaceutically effective amount or a diagnostically effective amount.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “pharmaceutically effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” means an amount of a compound according to the invention which, when administered to a patient in need thereof, is sufficient to effect treatment for disease-states, conditions, or disorders for which the compounds have utility. Such an amount would be sufficient to elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, or patient that is sought by a researcher or clinician. The amount of a compound of according to the invention which constitutes a therapeutically effective amount will vary depending on such factors as the compound and its biological activity, the composition used for administration, the time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of treatment, the type of disease-state or disorder being treated and its severity, drugs used in combination with or coincidentally with the compounds of the invention, and the age, body weight, general health, sex, and diet of the patient. Such a therapeutically effective amount can be determined routinely by one of ordinary skill in the art having regard to their own knowledge, the prior art, and this disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “diagnostically effective amount” means an amount of a compound according to the invention which, when used in a diagnostic method, apparatus, or assay, is sufficient to achieve the desired diagnostic effect or the desired biological activity necessary for the diagnostic method, apparatus, or assay. Such an amount would be sufficient to elicit the biological or medical response in a diagnostic method, apparatus, or assay, which may include a biological or medical response in a patient or in a in vitro or in vivo tissue or system, that is sought by a researcher or clinician. The amount of a compound according to the invention which constitutes a diagnostically effective amount will vary depending on such factors as the compound and its biological activity, the diagnostic method, apparatus, or assay used, the composition used for administration, the time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound, the duration of administration, drugs and other compounds used in combination with or coincidentally with the compounds of the invention, and, if a patient is the subject of the diagnostic administration, the age, body weight, general health, sex, and diet of the patient. Such a diagnostically effective amount can be determined routinely by one of ordinary skill in the art having regard to their own knowledge, the prior art, and this disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms “treating” or “treatment” mean the treatment of a disease-state in a patient, and include:\n\n \n \n \n \n \n(i) preventing the disease-state from occurring in a patient, in particular, when such patient is genetically or otherwise predisposed to the disease-state but has not yet been diagnosed as having it;\n \n(ii) inhibiting or ameliorating the disease-state in a patient, i.e., arresting or slowing its development; or\n \n(iii) relieving the disease-state in a patient, i.e., causing regression or cure of the disease-state.\n \n \n \n\n\nIn Vitro Assay for Inhibition of Chymase\n\n\n \n \n \nChymase assays were performed in a total volume of 15 μL in Corning black opaque 384-well microtiter plates with a non-binding surface (Corning, N.Y.). The assay buffer was comprised of 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.01% CHAPS. The test compounds were serially diluted 3-fold with neat DMSO in a 96-well polypropylene plate from a 10 mM DMSO stock to give the 10 point dose response curve. 3 μL of the resulting DMSO solution were transferred to a 384-well polypropylene plate in duplicate, and 37 μL of assay buffer was added. Chymase was added to the assay plate in 3 uL of assay buffer followed by 2 uL of the appropriate compound dilution using a PlateMate Plus (Matrix Technologies Corp., Hudson, N.H.). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 uL rhodamine 110, bis-(succinoyl-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-prolyl-L-phenylalanylamide) (American Peptides, Sunnyvale, Calif.) in assay buffer containing 150 μM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, Pierce Chemical, Rockford, Ill.) using a Multidrop (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, Mass.). Final assay concentrations were 500 μM chymase, 100 nM substrate, 100 μM TCEP, and 1% DMSO. The plates were incubated at 28° C. and 80% humidity for 1 hour, at which time the fluorescence was read on a Viewlux 1430 Microplate Imager (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, Mass.) with 485 nm excitation, 530 nm emission, and a fluorescein dichroic mirror. The percentage of control values were calculated relative to assay blanks containing complete reaction minus chymase and a 100% control containing assay buffer with 1% DMSO in place of compound. IC50 values were obtained by fitting the data using XLFit4 (IDBS Software).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred compounds of the invention have an IC50 activity of 50 nanoMolar (nM) or less.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll patent and literature references cited in this application are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety."
