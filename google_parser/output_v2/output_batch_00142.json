Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to compounds useful in the modulation of potassium channel activity in cells, in particular the activity of Kv1.3 channels found in T cells. The invention also relates to the use of these compounds in the treatment or prevention of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and methods for their preparation.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\nMany autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases are related to immunoregulatory abnormalities. Diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosis, chronic rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis have in common the appearance of autoantibodies and self-reactive lymphocytes.\n\n\nMultiple sclerosis is the most common neurological disease of young people. It is believed to cost more in medical care and lost income than any other neurological disease of young adults.\n\n\nMultiple sclerosis affects the myelin sheaths of nerves. Myelin is an insulating material that coats most axons and allows rapid signal conduction over long distances by saltatory conduction. It is thought that antibodies and specialised cells of the immune system attack the myelin coating. This process leads to inflammation and scarring (sclerosis) which damages blood vessels in the area by the formation of a lesion known as a plaque. These plaques are characterised by being infiltrated by macrophages and T cells. This results in demyelination with the consequential loss of the rapid signal conduction.\n\n\nA possible method of treating these autoimmune and inflammatory diseases is by suppressing T-cell proliferation and modulating their activation.\n\n\nThe early stages of T-cell activation may be conceptually separated into pre-Ca\n2+\n and post-Ca\n2+\n events (Cahalan and Chandy 1997, \nCurr. Opin. Biotechnol. \n8 749). Following engagement of the T-cell receptor by an antigen, activation of tyrosine kinases and the generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate lead to the influx of Ca\n2+\n and a rise in the cytoplasmic Ca\n2+\n concentration. The rise in Ca\n2+\n activates the phosphatase calcineurin, which then dephosphorylates a cytoplasmically localized transcription factor (N-FAT) enabling it to accumulate in the nucleus and bind to a promoter element of the interleukin-2 gene. Along with parallel events involving the activation of protein kinase C and ras, gene transcription leads to lymphokine secretion and to lymphocyte proliferation. Some genes require long-lasting Ca\n2+\n signals while others require only a transient rise of Ca\n2+\n.\n\n\nIon channels underlie the Ca\n2+\n signal of T-lymphocytes. Ca\n2+\n ions move across the plasma membrane through a channel termed the store-operated Ca\n2+\n channel or the calcium release-activated Ca\n2+\n channel. Two distinct types of potassium channels indirectly determine the driving force of calcium entry. The first is the voltage-gated Kv1.3 channel (Cahalan 1985, \nJ. Physiol. \n385: 197; Grissmer 1990\n, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n87 9411; Verheugen 1995, \nJ. Gen. Physiol. \n105 765; Aiyar 1996, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n271 31013; Cahalan and Chandy 1997, \nCurr. Opin. Biotechnol. \n8 749) and the second is the intermediate-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, IKCa1 (Grissmer 1993, \nJ. Gen. Physiol. \n102 601; Fanger 1999 \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n274 5746; Rauer 1999, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n274 21885; VanDorpe 1998, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n273 21542; Joiner 1997, \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n94 11013; Khanna 1999, \nJ. Bio. Chem. \n274 14838; Lodgson 1997, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n272 32723; Ghanshani 1998, \nGenomics \n51 160). When these potassium channels open, the resulting efflux of K\n+\n hyperpolarizes the membrane, which in turn accentuates the entry of Ca\n2+\n, which is absolutely required for downstream activation events (Cahalan and Chandy 1997, \nCurr. Opin. Biotechnol. \n8: 749).\n\n\nThe predominant voltage-gated channel in human T-lymphocytes is encoded by Kv1.3, a Shaker-related gene. Kv1.3 has been characterised extensively at the molecular and physiological level and plays a vital role in controlling T-lymphocyte proliferation, mainly by maintaining the resting membrane potential of resting T-lymphocytes. Inhibition of this channel depolarises the cell membrane sufficiently to decrease the influx of Ca\n2+\n and thereby prevents downstream activation events. Advantageously the Kv1.3 channel is almost exclusively located in T-lymphocytes.\n\n\nAccordingly, compounds which are selective Kv1.3 blockers are potential therapeutic agents as immunosuppressants for the prevention of graft rejection, and the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. They could be used alone or in conjunction with other immunosuppressants, such as selective IKCa1 blockers or cyclosporin, in order to achieve synergism and/or to reduce toxicity, especially of cyclosporin.\n\n\nDevelopments in the field of voltage-gated K-channel electrophysiology have strengthened the case for treating of multiple sclerosis and also diabetes mellitus by inhibiting the Kv1.3 channel. It was found that autoreactive T-cells from multiple sclerosis patients exhibit highly elevated levels of Kv1.3 (Wulff, H et al (2003) J. Clin Invest. 111 (11) 1703-1713). ShK-K22Dap, a selective peptide blocker of Kv1.3, potently inhibited the proliferation of T-cells with this high-Kv1.3 phenotype. (Beeton, C. et al (2001) PNAS 98 13942-13947). The connection between T-cell replication and Kv1.3 blockade has also been shown through the use of a small molecule, a psoralen derivative, that is an active and relatively specific inhibitor of the Kv1.3 channel. The derivative showed specificity in inhibiting the proliferation of the high Kv1.3 T-cells over peripheral blood T-cells (Vennekamp et al (2004) Mol. Pharm. 65 1364-1374).\n\n\nThe Kv1.3 channel has also been associated with diabetes. Studies of Kv1.3 knockout mice found that the mice have increased insulin sensitivity. The selective blockage of the Kv1.3 channel also led to increased insulin sensitivity (Xu, J. et al. (2004) \nPNAS \n101 (9), 3122-3117). It has been suggested by Wulff, who was involved in the electrophysiology on multiple sclerosis that diabetes also involves autoreactive T-cells that express very high levels of Kv1.3 (Wulff, H. et al. (2003) \nCurr. Op. DDD. \n6 640-647).\n\n\nAt present there exist a number of non-selective potassium channel blockers that will inhibit lymphocyte proliferation, but have adverse side effects. Other potassium channels exist in a wide range of tissues including the heart and brain, and generally blocking these channels is undesirable. Accordingly it would be advantageous to provide or identify compounds, which are selective inhibitors of the Kv1.3 channel.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 5,494,895 discloses the use of a thirty-nine amino acid peptide, scorpion peptide margatoxin, as a selective inhibitor and probe of Kv1.3 channels present in human lymphocytes, and also as an immunosuppressant. However the use of this compound is limited by its potent toxicity.\n\n\nInternational Patent Application publication No's WO 97/16438 and WO 09/716,437, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,051,590 describe the use of the triterpene, correolide and related compounds as immunosuppressants. The potential for these compounds to become immunosuppressants was illustrated by experiments showing their attenuation of the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response in mini-swine.\n\n\nU.S. Pat. No. 6,077,680 describes DNA segments and proteins derived from sea anemone species, more particularly ShK toxin from Stichodactyla helianthus. The ShK toxin was found to block Kv1.1, Kv1.3, Kv1.4 and Kv1.6, but a mutant ShK-K22DAP found to selectively block Kv1.3. Unfortunately the mutant did not exhibit the requisite pharmacokinetic profile for clinical use. A recently reported ShK analog, ShK(L5), was at least 100-fold more active against Kv1.3 (K\nd\n=69 pM) than Kv1.1 and furthermore it showed at least 250-fold selectivity over every other relevant member of the Kv1 family (Beeton et al. (2005) \nMol. Pharm\n. In press).\n\n\nBoth ShK toxin and ShK(L5) were shown to both prevent and treat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats, an animal model for human multiple sclerosis (Beeton, et al. (2001) \nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA \n98 13942), by selectively targeting T-cells chronically activated by the myelin antigen, MBP (myelin basic protein). The same study also indicated that chronically activated encephalitogenic rat T-cells express a unique channel phenotype characterised by high expression of Kv1.3 channels (approximately 1500 per cell) and low numbers of IKCa1 channels (approximately 120 per cell). This channel phenotype is distinct from that seen in quiescent and acutely activated cells and may be a functionally relevant marker for chronically activated rat T lymphocytes.\n\n\nOther compounds which are blockers of Kv1.3 include psoralens (Vennekamp et al. (2004) \nMol. Pharm. \n65, 1365-1374) and selected benzamides (Schalhofer et al. (2002) \nBiochem. \n41, 7781-7794 and Schalhofer et al (2003) \nBiochem. \n42, 4733-4743.\n\n\nKhellinone, a substituted benzofuran and natural product from certain plants, and 8-Methoxypsoralen (8-MOP), both commercially available products, have been found to exhibit blocking activity on the Kv1.3 channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKhellinone, 8-MOP and four dimeric variants thereof were described in a Poster (abstract. No. 1078) at a meeting of the American Physiological Society in Snowmass, Colo. (\nThe Physiologist \n42: A12 (1999)). The authors were testing whether linking two active units with a spacer, improved activity. Some of the bivalent derivatives were said to be ineffective, and others were said to block the Kv1.3 channel, but lack therapeutic utility due to their extreme sensitivity to hydrolysis (very poor stability) and high lipophilicity (poor solubility in clinical conditions).\n\n\nEuropean Patent Application 82201051 describes furano-chromone derivatives for use as anti-inflammatory agents amongst other suggested uses. An intermediate compound used in the manufacture of the chromone derivatives was 5-(benzoylacetyl)-4,7-dimethoxy-6-hydroxy-benzofuran.\n\n\nEuropean Patent Application 83302551 describes a process for preparing di-4,7-loweralkoxybenzofurans for use as intermediates in the preparation of khellin and related compounds.\n\n\nGerman patent DE 3710469 and European patent publication number EP303920 describe the synthesis of 5-acetyl-4-benzyloxy-7-methoxy-6-hydroxy-benzofuran by alkaline ring cleavage of a pyrone ring of a fused system. This is also described in an article by Musante in Annali de Chimica (1959) 46, 768-781 together with the compound where the benzyloxy group is replaced with the residue of 2-hydroxyacetophenone.\n\n\nAn article by Bougery, G et al in J. Med. Chem (1981) 24, 159-167 described 4-alkoxy(ethoxy and iso-propoxy) khellinone derivatives for use as intermediates in the manufacture of other compounds.\n\n\nAn article by Musante, C and Fatutta, S in Farmaco Eduzione Scientifics (1961) 16, 343-350 described a 7-glucosyl-khellinone compound for use as a coronary dilator.\n\n\nArticles by Abdel Hafez, O et al in Molecules (online computer file) (2001), 6(4), 396-405, by El-Hafez, O. in Bulletin of the Faculty of Pharmacy (Cairo University) (1996), 34(2), 111-117 and by Ragab, F. A. and Tawfeek, H in Eur. J. Med. Chem. (1987) 22(3), 265-267 describe assorted khellinone derivatives with assorted alkylamines at the 7 position.\n\n\nPCT publication WO 03/078416 discloses dimers of assorted khellinone derivatives, linked via a spacer group. The spacer group is attached to the 6 position of each khellinone ring.\n\n\nPCT publication WO 03/076407 discloses assorted khellinone derivatives which have been modified at the 5-position (the acyl group) to include a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nIn a first aspect the invention relates to compounds of the general formula I and salts thereof;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nwherein R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare independently selected from hydrogen, halo, C\n1-6 \nalkyl, halo C\n1-6 \nalkyl, phenyl and benzyl;\n\n\nR\n3 \nis an unsubstituted or halo substituted C\n1-6 \nalkyl;\n\n\nR\n4 \nand R\n5 \nare independently selected from C\n1-10 \nalkyl, C\n2-10 \nalkenyl; C\n2-10 \nalkynyl, C\n1-10 \nalkoxy, C\n2-10 \nalkenyloxy and C\n2-10 \nalkynyloxy;\n\n\nand one of R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nis optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from halo, aryl, aryloxy, heteroaryl and heteroaryloxy, the aryl, aryloxy, heteroaryl and heteroaryloxy substituents being optionally substituted;\n\n\nand where the other of R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nis substituted with an aryl, aryloxy, heteroaryl or heteroaryloxy group, the group being optionally substituted,\n\n\nX is O, S or NR\n7 \nwhere R\n7 \nis independently selected from hydrogen, C\n1-6 \nalkyl and halo C\n1-6 \nalkyl;\n\n\nprovided that R\n4 \ncan not be unsubstituted benzyloxy when X is O, R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare hydrogen, R\n3 \nis methyl and R\n5 \nis methoxy.\n\n\n\n\nThe term “alkyl” as used alone or in combination herein refers to a straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon group.

Unless otherwise indicated the substituent is attached to the parent structure by the alkyl part of the substituent. Likewise the terms “aryl C\n1-12 \nalkyl”, “aryl C\n2-12 \nalkenyl” and “aryl C\n2-12 \nalkynyl” refer to carbocyclic aromatic rings or ring systems as previously described and substituted by a C\n1-12 \nalkyl, C\n2-12 \nalkenyl or C\n2-12 \nalkynyl group, as previously described.\n\n\nThe terms “halo” and “halogen” refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo groups.\n\n\nThe term “halo alkyl” group has one or more of the hydrogen atoms on an alkyl group replaced with halogens.

The term “pharmaceutically acceptable derivative” includes pharmaceutically acceptable esters, prodrugs, solvates and hydrates of the compounds of formula I or salts thereof. Pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives may include any pharmaceutically acceptable hydrate or any other compound or prodrug which, upon administration to a subject, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound of formula I or an active metabolite or residue thereof.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutically acceptable salts include acid addition salts, base addition salts, and the salts of quaternary amines and pyridiniums.

The salts may be made in a known manner, for example by treating the compound with an appropriate acid or base in the presence of a suitable solvent.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be in crystalline form or as solvates (e.g. hydrates) and it is intended that both forms be within the scope of the present invention. The term “solvate” is a complex of variable stoichiometry formed by a solute (in this invention, a compound of the invention) and a solvent. Such solvents should not interfere with the biological activity of the solute. Solvents may be, by way of example, water, ethanol or acetic acid. Methods of solvation are generally known within the art.\n\n\nThe term “pro-drug” is used in its broadest sense and encompasses those derivatives that are converted in vivo to the compounds of the invention. Such derivatives would readily occur to those skilled in the art, and include, for example, compounds where a free hydroxy group is converted into an ester derivative or a ring nitrogen atom is converted to an N-oxide. Examples of ester derivatives include alkyl esters, phosphate esters and those formed from amino acids, preferably valine. Any compound that is a prodrug of a compound of the invention is within the scope and spirit of the invention.\n\n\nThe term “pharmaceutically acceptable ester” includes biologically acceptable esters of compound of the invention such as sulphonic, phosphonic and carboxylic acid derivatives.\n\n\nThus, in another aspect of the invention, there is provided a prodrug or pharmaceutically acceptable ester of a compound of formula I of salt thereof.\n\n\nIt will be appreciated that the compounds of formula I and some derivatives thereof may have at least one asymmetric centre, and therefore are capable of existing in more than one stereoisomeric form. The invention extends to each of these forms individually and to mixtures thereof, including racemates. The isomers may be separated conventionally by chromatographic methods or using a resolving agent. Alternatively the individual isomers may be prepared by asymmetric synthesis using chiral intermediates. Where the compound has at least one carbon-carbon double bond, it may occur in Z- and E-forms with all isomeric forms of the compounds being included in the present invention.\n\n\nIn some preferred embodiments of the invention, and with reference to the general formula I, one or more of the following preferred definitions apply:\n\n \n \na) R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare selected from hydrogen, lower alkyl or halo, and are preferably hydrogen.\n \nb) R\n3 \nis unsubstituted C\n1-6 \nalkyl, most preferably methyl.\n \n\n\nPreferably, R\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare both hydrogen and R\n3 \nis methyl.\n\n \n \nc) One of R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nis C\n1-10 \nalkyl, C\n2-10 \nalkenyl, C\n2-10 \nalkynyl, C\n1-10 \nalkoxy, C\n2-10 \nalkenyloxy, C\n2-10 \nalkynyloxy.

Formulations containing ten (10) milligrams of active ingredient or, more broadly, 0.1 to one hundred (100) milligrams, per tablet, are accordingly suitable representative unit dosage forms.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention can be administered in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise, as the active component, either a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the invention.\n\n\nFor preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispensable granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavouring agents, solubilisers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material.\n\n\nIn powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid that is in a mixture with the finely divided active component.\n\n\nIn tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired.\n\n\nThe powders and tablets preferably contain from five or ten to about seventy percent of the active compound. Suitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term “preparation” is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid forms suitable for oral administration.\n\n\nFor preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as an admixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized moulds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.\n\n\nLiquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example, water or water-propylene glycol solutions. For example, parenteral injection liquid preparations can be formulated as solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution.\n\n\nSterile liquid form compositions include sterile solutions, suspensions, emulsions, syrups and elixirs. The active ingredient can be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as sterile water, sterile organic solvent or a mixture of both.\n\n\nThe compounds according to the present invention may thus be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g. by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulation agents such as suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilisation from solution, for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.\n\n\nAqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavours, stabilising and thickening agents, as desired.\n\n\nAqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or other well known suspending agents.\n\n\nAlso included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavours, stabilisers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilising agents, and the like.\n\n\nFor topical administration to the epidermis the compounds according to the invention may be formulated as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch. Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or colouring agents.\n\n\nFormulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising active agent in a flavoured base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.\n\n\nSolutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means, for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be provided in single or multidose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the case of a spray, this may be achieved for example by means of a metering atomising spray pump. To improve nasal delivery and retention the compounds according to the invention may be encapsulated with cyclodextrins, or formulated with other agents expected to enhance delivery and retention in the nasal mucosa.\n\n\nAdministration to the respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol formulation in which the active ingredient is provided in a pressurised pack with a suitable propellant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) for example dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gas. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by provision of a metered valve.\n\n\nAlternatively the active ingredients may be provided in the form of a dry powder, for example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Conveniently the powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of, e.g., gelatin, or blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler.\n\n\nIn formulations intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including intranasal formulations, the compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of 5 to 10 microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronisation.\n\n\nWhen desired, formulations adapted to give sustained release of the active ingredient may be employed.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms.

This chronic neurological disorder affects the nerves of the central nervous system. As discussed earlier most nerves in the body are normally insulated by a protective sheath of fatty substance called myelin. Multiple sclerosis causes demyelination, in which this protective sheath becomes inflamed and ultimately destroyed.\n\n\nBy modulating or changing the immune system response that is thought to be responsible for the attack on the central nervous system it should be possible to attack the cause of the disease itself, rather than the more traditional method of controlling the symptoms.\n\n\nThe nature of the disease is such that it may be possible to control multiple sclerosis without unduly suppressing the patient's immune system. Based on the earlier discussed chronically activated human T-lymphocytes study, it is speculated that multiple sclerosis may be a product of chronically activated T-cells having a channel phenotype characterised by high expression of Kv1.3 channels and low numbers of IKCa1 channels. As this channel phenotype is distinct from that seen in quiescent and acutely activated cells it may provide a useful means for controlling multiple sclerosis without the significant side effects of less specific drugs.\n\n\nFurthermore, in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis or diabetic neuropathy, the destruction of the myelin sheath evokes an internodal potassium current in myelinated nerve fibers by uncovering normally silent potassium channels. These abnormal potassium currents contribute to the conduction failure observed in demyelinated neurons. Blockers of axonal potassium channels such as the unselective compound 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) have been demonstrated to overcome conduction failure in vitro and to improve disability in certain multiple sclerosis patients. 4-AP (Fampridine) is currently in clinical trials for multiple sclerosis. Compounds that block both the Kv1.3 channel in autoreactive T-cells and the Kv1.1-Kv1.2 heteromultimeric channels present in the Ranvier Nodes of myelinated nerves might be ideally suited for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Such compounds could simultaneously enhance impulse propagation in demyelinated neurons and modify the immune response.\n\n\nThus in another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of preventing or treating autoimmune or chronic inflammatory diseases, the prevention of rejection of foreign organ transplants and/or related afflictions, said method including the step of administrating a compound of formula I, or salt thereof, including a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, or a composition comprising the compound or salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof.\n\n\nAccordingly in a preferred form of the invention, there is provided a means for controlling multiple sclerosis by the application of a blocker of the Kv1.3 channel, preferably a selective channel blocker of the Kv1.3 channel, and optionally also a blocker of Kv1.1 and/or Kv1.2 channels, by the application of a compound of formula I or salt thereof, including a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, or a composition comprising the compound of formula I or salt thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof.\n\n\nIn another preferred form of the invention there is provided a method for preventing or treating diabetes including the step of administrating a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, including a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, or a composition comprising the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof.\n\n\nIn a further aspect, the invention provides a method of modulating potassium ion channel activity of T-cells by the application of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, including a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, or a composition comprising the same, to said T cells. Preferably the compounds of the invention inhibit the potassium ion channel activity of T-cells.\n\n\nPreferably the potassium channel activity inhibited by the compound of Formula I is a voltage-gated potassium channel, for example, Kv1.1-Kv1.7. More preferably the potassium ion channel activity is the voltage-gated potassium channel, Kv1.3 of a T-cell. Preferably the compound selectively inhibits the Kv1.3 channel, and optionally also the Kv1.1 and/or Kv1.2 channels.\n\n\nIn a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided the use of a compound of formula I or salt thereof, including a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment (therapeutic or prophylactic) of disease states mediated by potassium channels, and in particular by blocking the Kv1.3 channel.\n\n\nIn a further aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the production of the compounds of Formula I or salts thereof, including pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.\n\n\nThe compounds of the invention can be made from khellin, a natural product from plants which is cheap and commercially available. A general synthetic scheme is set out below for those compounds where R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nincludes an oxygen atom linking it to the parent structure:—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWhere L is a halide leaving group and R\na \nand R\nb \nare independently selected from C\n1-10 \nalkyl, C\n2-10 \nalkenyl and C\n2-10 \nalkynyl, C\n1-10 \nalkoxy, C\n2-10 \nalkenyloxy and C\n2-10 \nalkynyloxy;\n\n\nand one of R\na \nand R\nb \nis optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from halo, aryl, aryloxy, heteroaryl and heteroaryloxy, the aryl, aryloxy, heteroaryl and heteroaryloxy, the substituents being optionally substituted;\n\n\nand where the other of R\na \nand R\nb \nis substituted with aryl, aryloxy, heteroaryl or heteroaryloxy group, the group being optionally substituted.\n\n\n\n\nThe vinylogous ester containing six-membered ring of khellin acts as a protecting group for the ultimate phenol and acetyl functionalities during the manipulations of the ethers. An alternate synthesis from khellinone can be envisaged where the phenol at the 6-position is capped with a suitable protecting group.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention where R\na \nis other than Me may be synthesised in accordance with the following scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 4,4 linked dimers of the invention may be synthesised in accordance with the following scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe linker can be any suitable group, which has bis halo substitution with a suitable halide leaving group L, such as Bromine. The linker can be L-(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-L, substituted forms thereof and can be L-CH\n2\n—C\n6\nH\n4\n—CH\n2\n-L.\n\n\nCompounds of the invention where R\nb \nis other than Me may be synthesised in accordance with the following scheme. This scheme is preferred when the reaction with the alkyl halide is facile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alternative reaction scheme is preferred when the reaction with alkyl halide is slow, either due to the low reactivity of alkyl halides such as alkyl chlorides or due to the requirement of two consecutive alkylations when forming dimers. The scheme begins with the preparation of 7-desmethylkhellin, which can then be used to prepare the compounds of the invention.\n\n\nSynthesis of intermediate 7-desmethylkhellin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesis of compounds of formula I when R\nb \nis other than Me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA preferred embodiment of 7-alkoxykhellinones is any aryl-(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—O— substituted example (R\nb \nis Ar—(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—, where n is 1 to 7). An alternative synthesis for this subset of compounds is shown below. Sonogashira coupling of 7-alkynyl khellin with an aryl iodide may furnish an aryl alkyne, which upon hydrogenation, reoxidation of the benzofuran, and hydrolysis may afford the desired aryl-(CH\n2\n)\nn\n—O-khellin. Heck coupling of 7-allyl khellin offers an alternate pathway to this class of compounds. Suitable coupling agents are known in the art and include Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n2\nCl\n2\n, Pd(PPh\n3\n)\n4\n, Pd(dibenzylideneacetone), and PdCl\n2\n(CH\n3\nCN)\n2\n. Preferably the palladium catalysed coupling reactions include a co-catalyst, for instance, CuI, in the presence of a suitable base such as a trialkylamine base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesis of 7,7 linked dimers of formula I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMixed dimers of formula I can also be synthesised. The following scheme depicts the method of preparing a 7,6 linked dimer of formula I. Similar methods can be used to prepare the other mixed dimers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA bifunctional linker precursor is reacted through its alkyl halide with one molecule of khellinone or a derivative thereof. Then the second linker functional group, an alcohol, is employed as a nucleophile in a Mitsunobu reaction with a different khellinone derivative to give the mixed dimer.\n\n\nAlternatively it may be possible to mix two or more different khellinone derivatives may be mixed together and subsequently reacted with a linker compound in basic conditions to form a mixture of products that are then separated or used in combination. This approach may have difficulties depending on the nucleophilicities of each phenol.\n\n\n4-alkyl or 7-alkyl khellinones may be synthesised by the following prophetic schemes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting with 7-triflyl khellin (or the 7-bromo visnagin (not shown)) Sonogashira coupling with an alkyne may provide the disubstituted alkyne. Reduction of the alkyne, followed by selective oxidation and alkaline hydrolysis, may give the 7-alkyl khellinone. Note that an analogous preparation could be envisaged for the generation of 4-alkyl khellinones starting from 4-triflyl khellin.\n\n\nThese schemes may be used to synthesise compounds where one or both of R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nare independently selected from C\n1-10 \nalkyl, C\n2-10 \nalkenyl and C\n2-10 \nalkynyl;\n\n\nand one of R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nis optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from halo, aryl, aryloxy, heteroaryl and heteroaryloxy, the aryl, aryloxy, heteroaryl and heteroaryloxy substituents being optionally substituted;\n\n\nand where the other of R\n4 \nand R\n5 \nis substituted with aryl, aryloxy, heteroaryl or heteroaryloxy group, the group being optionally substituted.\n\n\nIn the above schemes the following abbreviations were used:—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTFA\n\n\ntrifluoroacetic acid\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPMBCl\n\n\npara methoxybenzyl chloride\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEAD\n\n\ndiethylazodicarboxylate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAq\n\n\naqueous\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTf\n2\nO\n\n\ntriflic anhydride\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother variation is to add, remove or modify the substituents of the product to form new derivatives. This could be achieved by using standard techniques for functional group inter-conversion, well known in the industry such as those described in Comprehensive organic transformations: a guide to functional group preparations by Larock R C, New York, VCH Publishers, Inc. 1989.\n\n\nExamples of possible functional group inter-conversions are: —C(O)NRR′ from —CO\n2\nCH\n3 \nby heating with or without catalytic metal cyanide, e.g. NaCN, and HNRR′ in CH\n3\nOH;

The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature (rt) then was stirred at rt for 16 h. On cooling the reaction mixture to 0° C., the reaction was quenched with water by dropwise addition at first, but at an increasing rate until 50 mL had been added. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo to remove the dichloromethane and the resulting suspension was filtered, washing with water. The orange solid was heated as a suspension in propan-2-ol (200 mL) at 70° C. for 20 min, during which time the solid became pale yellow.

suspension of 1 (10.4 g, 40 mmol) in dichloromethane (100 mL) at −78° C. was added over 75 min boron tribromide (1M in dichloromethane, 80 mL, 80 mmol). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to rt then was stirred at rt for 16 h. On cooling the reaction mixture to 0° C., the reaction was quenched with water by dropwise addition at first, but at an increasing rate until 50 mL had been added.

Alkylation of di-4,9-(desmethyl)khellin\n\n\nA suspension of 2 (1.0 equiv.), potassium carbonate (2.0 equiv.) and alkyl or benzyl halide (1.1 equiv.) in anhydrous dimethylformamide (0.25 M) was stirred under nitrogen at 60° C. until completion as determined by TLC (typically 2-4 h). The reaction mixture was then diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with 2M HCl (twice) and brine, dried (MgSO\n4\n), and concentrated in vacuo, The crude was purified by flash chromatography.\n\n\nGeneral Procedure B Methylation of 9-alkyl-4-(desmethyl)khellin\n\n\nA suspension of the phenol (1.0 equiv.), caesium carbonate (5.0 equiv.) and iodomethane (5.0 equiv.) in anhydrous dimethylformamide (0.15 M) was stirred under nitrogen at rt for 16 h. The reaction mixture was partitioned over 2M HCl and ethyl acetate and the organic phase was extracted with 2M HCl (twice) then washed with brine. After drying (MgSO\n4\n) and evaporation the residue was either purified by flash chromatography or used directly in the following step.\n\n\nGeneral Procedure C Hydrolysis of 4-methyl-9-alkylkhellin\n\n\nTo a solution of the khellin analogue in ethanol (2 parts, 0.01-0.1 M) at reflux was added slowly 3M NaOH or KOH (1 part) and the resulting solution was stirred at reflux for 3-4 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo to one third of the original volume and then acidified to pH2 by Universal indicator with 2M HCl. If precipitation occurred, the solid was collected by filtration washing with water. The solid was then dried in the presence of P\n2\nO\n5\n. If precipitation did not occur the acidified reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (twice) and the pooled organics were washed with brine, dried (MgSO\n4\n) and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography.\n\n\nGeneral Procedure D Alkylation of 9-desmethylkhellin\n\n\nA suspension of 35 (1.0 equiv.), caesium carbonate (2.0 equiv.), potassium iodide (1.0 equiv.) and the chloroalkane (2.0 equiv.) in anhydrous dimethylformamide (0.20 M) was stirred at 60° C. until completion as determined by TLC (typically 2-3 d). The reaction mixture was partitioned over 2M HCl and ethyl acetate and the organic phase was extracted with 2M HCl (twice) then washed with brine. After drying (MgSO\n4\n) and evaporation the residue was purified by flash chromatography.\n\n\nGeneral Procedure E Alkylation of 36 or 37 with phenols/imidazoles\n\n\nA suspension of alkyl bromide 36 or 37 (1.0 equiv.), Cs\n2\nCO\n3 \nor K\n2\nCO\n3 \n(2.5 equiv.) and the phenol/imidazole (1.5-3.0 equiv.) in anhydrous DMF (˜1.5 mL/60 mg of bromide) in a screw cap vial was shaken at 60° C. overnight. The reaction was quenched with 10% aqueous citric acid or saturated NH\n4\nCl and extracted with ethyl acetate or dichloromethane. The organic layer was washed twice with water then with brine, dried over MgSO\n4 \nand concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography.\n\n\nThe following examples were prepared by the above methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation

Determination of EC\n50 \n(Blockade)\n\n\n\nThe effectiveness of the generated compounds in blocking the Kv1.3 current was assayed on L929 cells stably expressing mKv1.3 or on activated human T cells. The generation of this cell line has been previously described (Grissmer et al. (1995) \nMol. Pharmacol. \n45: 1227). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM Na\n+\n pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 250 μg G418 (to keep them under selection pressure). The cells were studied in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. The holding potential in all experiments was −80 mV. Currents were recorded in normal Ringer solution (160 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 290-310 mOsm) with an internal pipette solution containing 134 mM KF, 2 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA (pH 7.2, 290-310 mOsm). If currents exceeded 2 nA 60-80% series resistance compensation was used. 200-ms depolarising pulses to 40 mV were applied every 30 s (Grissmer at al. (1995) \nMol. Pharmacol. \n45: 1227). Each compound was tested twice at two to five different concentrations. K\nd \nvalues were determined by normalizing the reduction of the area under the current curve to the area under the current curve of the control current in the absence of drug and fitting the resulting normalized values to the Hill equation.\n\n\nThe results of the determination are set out in Tables 5, 7, 8 and 9 below. Those compounds less active at Kv1.3 are still of interest as being potentially selective for Kv channels other than Kv1.3.\n\n\n2. Determination of EC\n50 \n(Proliferation)\n\n\n[\n3\nH]-thymidine incorporation is a widely used test to assay the proliferative activity of human and rodent lymphocytes. As cells divide [\n3\nH]-thymidine will be incorporated into the newly synthesised DNA of the resulting daughter cells. The faster cells grow the more radioactive [\n3\nH]-thymidine will be incorporated. Any compound that inhibits lymphocytes proliferation will reduce the uptake of radioactivity by the cells treated with it compared to the untreated controls.\n\n\nThe selected compounds were tested to determine its ability to inhibit [\n3\nH]-thymidine incorporation and the results are set out in table 6 below. Resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers were seeded at 2×10\n5 \ncells per well in medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol) in flat-bottom 96 well plates (final volume 200 μl). Cells were pre-incubated with the compound of example 2 for 60 min, and were stimulated with 5 ng/ml anti-CD3 Ab for 48 h. [\n3\nH]-Thymidine (1 μCi per well) was added for the last 6 h. Cells were harvested onto glass fibre filters and radioactivity measured in a scintillation counter. All experiments were done in triplicate. Results are normalised for maximum [\n3\nH]-thymidine incorporation by control. The untreated control had a normalised [\n3\nH]-thymidine incorporation of 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiological Activity (Blockade) for compounds of

Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is directed to 1-(arylsulfonyl)-4-(piperazin-1-yl)-1H-benzimidazole compounds, pharmaceutical compositions processes for their preparation, their use for modulation of 5-HT\n6 \nactivity and methods for treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nSerotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) (5-HT) receptors play a critical role in many physiological and behavioral functions in humans and animals. These functions are mediated through various 5-HT receptors distributed throughout the body. There are now approximately fifteen different human 5-HT receptor subtypes that have been cloned, many with well-defined roles in humans. A recently identified 5-HT receptor subtype is the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor, first cloned from rat tissue in 1993 (Monsma, F. J.; Shen, Y.; Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W. \nMolecular Pharmacology \n1993, 43, 320-327) and subsequently from human tissue (Kohen, R.; Metcalf, M. A.; Khan, N.; Druck, T.; Huebner, K.; Sibley, D. R. \nJournal of Neurochemistry \n1996, 66, 47-56). The receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) positively coupled to adenylate cyclase (Ruat, M., Traiffort, E., Arrang, J-M., Tardivel-Lacombe, L., Diaz, L., Leurs, R., and Schwartz, J.-C., \nBiochemical Biophysical Research Communications \n1993, 193, 268-276). The receptor is found almost exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS) areas both in rat and in human. In situ hybridization studies of the\n\n\n5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in rat brain using mRNA indicate principal localization in the areas of 5-HT projection including striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and hippocampal formation (Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W.; Lachowicz, J. E.; Hoffman, B. J.; Sibley, D. R.; Dorsa, D. M. \nNeuroscience \n1995, 64, 1105-1111).\n\n\n5-HT\n6 \nreceptor in rat brain using mRNA indicate principal localization in the areas of 5-HT projection including striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, and hippocampal formation (Ward, R. P.; Hamblin, M. W.; Lachowicz, J. E.; Hoffman, B. J.; Sibley, D. R.; Dorsa, D. M. \nNeuroscience \n1995, 64, 1105-1111).\n\n\nThere are many potential therapeutic uses for 5-HT\n6 \nligands in humans based on direct effects and on indications from available scientific studies. These studies include the localization of the receptor, the affinity of ligands with known in vivo activity, and various animal studies conducted so far.\n\n\nOne potential therapeutic use of modulators of 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor function is in the enhancement of cognition and memory in human diseases such as Alzheimer's. The high levels of receptor found in important structures in the forebrain, including the caudate/putamen, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and cortex suggest a role for the receptor in memory and cognition since these areas are known to play a vital role in memory (Gerard, C.; Martres, M.-P.; Lefevre, K.; Miguel, M. C.; Verge, D.; Lanfumey, R.; Doucet, E.; Hamon, M.; E I Mestikawy, S. \nBrain Research, \n1997, 746, 207-219). The ability of known 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands to enhance cholinergic transmission also supported the potential cognition use (Bentley, J. C.; Boursson, A.; Boess, F. G.; Kone, F. C.; Marsden, C. A.; Petit, N.; Sleight, A. J. \nBritish Journal of Pharmacology, \n1999, 126(7), 1537-1542). Studies have found that a known 5-HT\n6 \nselective antagonist significantly increased glutamate and aspartate levels in the frontal cortex without elevating levels of noradrenaline, dopamine, or 5-HT. This selective elevation of neurochemicals known to be involved in memory and cognition point to a role for 5-HT\n6 \nligands in cognition (Dawson, L. A.; Nguyen, H. Q.; Li, P. \nBritish Journal of Pharmacology, \n2000, 130(1), 23-26). Animal studies of memory and learning with a known selective 5-HT\n6 \nantagonist found positive effects (Rogers, D. C.; Hatcher, P. D.; Hagan, J. J. \nSociety of Neuroscience, Abstracts \n2000, 26, 680).\n\n\nA related potential therapeutic use for 5-HT\n6 \nligands, particularly antagonists, is the treatment of attention deficit disorders (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in both children and adults. Ernst, M; Zametkin, A. J.; Matochik, J. H.; Jons, P. A.; Cohen, R. M. \nJournal of Neuroscience \n1998, 18(15), 5901-5907).\n\n\n5-HT\n6 \nligands also show potential for the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. For example, clozapine (an effective clinical antipsychotic) has high affinity for the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor subtype. Also, several clinical antidepressants have high affinity for the receptor as well and act as antagonists at this site (Branchek, T. A.; Blackburn, T. P. \nAnnual Reviews in Pharmacology and Toxicology \n2000, 40, 319-334).\n\n\nImpaired cognitive function is a core feature of schizophrenia, exhibiting numerous manifestations, including a fundamental defect in the patient's ability to manipulate available information. Weinberger et. al. International clinical psychopharmacology, 1997, 12, 38-40. The magnitude of the cognitive deficit in schizophrenia is considerable and remains relatively stable despite fluctuations in other symptoms. Id. The degree of dysfunction also has a high predictive value for long-term disability. Id. Good cognitive function depends upon the brain's ability to prioritize tasks and to switch from parallel processing to sequential processing when the processing load is excessive. Id. This requires working executive memory. Neuroimaging and functional analyses suggest that such cognitive function relies upon unimpaired prefrontal activity. Id. There is increasing evidence that antipsychotic drugs with 5-hydroxytryptamine-blocking activity (particularly 5-HT\n2a\n) produce better cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia than drugs with predominantly dopamine (D)\n2\n-blocking activity (conventional neuroleptics). Id. Accordingly, improving or stabilizing cognitive function in patients suffering from schizophrenia through administration of antipsychotic drugs with 5-hydroxytryptamine-blocking activity will ideally lead to improved patient outcomes.\n\n\nThe neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia are considered a separate area of the illness that is relatively independent of psychotic symptoms and closely related to functional outcome. These neurocognitive deficits include working memory, attention/vigilance, verbal learning and memory, visual learning and memory, reasoning and problem-solving, speed of processing, and social recognition (Green M F, Nuechterlein K H, Gold J M, et al. “Approaching a consensus cognitive battery for clinical trials in schizophrenia: the NIMH-MATRICS conference to select cognitive domains and test criteria”, Biol. Psychiatry 2004; 56:301-307).\n\n\nFurther, recent in vivo studies in rats indicate 5-HT\n6 \nmodulators may be useful in the treatment of movement disorders including epilepsy (Stean, T.; Routledge, C.; Upton, N. \nBritish Journal of Pharmacology \n1999, 127 Proc. Supplement 131P and Routledge, C.; Bromidge, S. M.; Moss, S. F.; Price, G. W.; Hirst, W.; Newman, H.; Riley, G.; Gager, T.; Stean, T.; Upton, N.; Clarke, S. E.; Brown, A. M. \nBritish Journal of Pharmacology \n2000, 130(7), 1606-1612).\n\n\nTaken together, the above studies strongly suggest that compounds which are 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor modulators, i.e. ligands, may be useful for therapeutic indications including: the treatment of symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease, such as dementia, a deficit in memory, cognition, and learning; the treatment of personality disorders such as schizophrenia; the treatment of behavioral disorders, e.g., anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorders; the treatment of ADD and ADHD; the treatment of motion or motor disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy; the treatment of diseases associated with neurodegeneration such as stroke and head trauma; or withdrawal from drug addiction including addiction to nicotine, alcohol, among others.\n\n\nBecause 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors are located almost exclusively in the brain, modulation of the receptors by parenterally administered drugs requires that the drugs cross the blood brain barrier. The blood brain barrier is composed of brain capillary endothelial cells with continuous tight junctions making it virtually impossible for compounds to enter into the brain around the cells. J. Bryan, Pharmaceutical Journal, 273 (2004) 475-476. Instead, access to the brain is limited to passive diffusion or active transport through the endothelial cells. G&G, Pharmaceutical Basis of Therapeutics, 10\nth \nEd at page 10. Accordingly, bioavailable parenterally administered compounds affecting 5-HT\n6 \nactivity must not only possess favorable solubility profiles in order to successfully enter the blood stream, but they also need to cross the blood brain barrier in order to target the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptors. Advantageously, this invention provides compounds which are capable of modulating 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor activity and are bioavailable.\n\n\nRecent clinical and preclinical efforts on 5-HT\n6 \nligands have been reviewed by Rudy Schreiber, Andrew Sleight and Marie Woolley, “5-HT6 Receptors as Targets for the Treatment of Cognitive Deficits in Schizophrenia” in The Receptors Book The Serotonin Receptors, Humana Press, 2006, Pages 495-515, Edited by Bryan L. Roth; Johnson C N, Ahmed M, Miller N D, “5-HT6 receptor antagonists: prospects for the treatment of cognitive disorders including dementia” Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 11 (5): 642-54 (September 2008), Jorg Holenz, Petrus J. Pauwels, Jose Luis Diaz, Ramon Merce, Xavier Codony, and Helmut Buschmann, “Medicinal chemistry strategies to 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor ligands as potential cognitive enhancers and antiobesity agents”, Drug Discovery Today, 11 (7/8) April 2006, and Robin Emsley, “Drugs in development for the treatment of schizophrenia”, Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs, 18 (8) 1103-1118, August 2009.\n\n\nNine 5-HT\n6 \nligands have entered human clinical trials. Lu-AE-58054 from Lundbeck is in schizophrenia cognitive disorder Phase II trials, SAM-531 from Wyeth is in Alzheimer's disease Phase II trials, SYN-114 from Synosia Therapeutics is in Alzheimer's disease Phase I trials, PRX-07034 from EPIX Pharmaceuticals Inc, is in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and obesity Phase Ib trials, SUVN-502 from Suven Life Sciences Ltd. is in Alzheimer's disease Phase I trials, SB-742457 from GlaxoSmithKline is in cognitive dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease Phase II trials, LY-483518 from Lilly, which is licensed to Saegis Pharmaceuticals (SGS-518) is in cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia Phase IIa trials, SAX-187 from Wyeth is currently in anxiety Phase I trials, and SB-271046 from GlaxoSmithKline was in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia Phase I trials but has been discontinued (probably because of low penetration of the blood-brain barrier).\n\n\nThe structures of 1-[(3-fluorophenyl)sulfonyl]-4-(1-piperazinyl)-1H-benzimidazole, 1-[(2-fluorophenyl)sulfonyl]-4-(1-piperazinyl)-1H-benzimidazole, 1-[(3-chlorophenyl)sulfonyl]-4-(1-piperazinyl)-1H-benzimidazole, 1-(1-naphthalenylsulfonyl)-4-(1-piperazinyl)-1H-benzimidazole, and 1-[(2,5-dichlorophenyl)sulfonyl]-4-(1-piperazinyl)-1H-benzimidazole were generated by ChemZoo, Inc. of Winston-Salem, N.C. in 2008 through the ChemSpider data base. However, the compounds do not appear to ever have been offered for sale. No information is provided as to their ability to bind to the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor or to any pharmacological effect or use of these compounds. There is no evidence they were ever made and no method for making the compounds is provided.\n\n\nThe invention provides compounds useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of a variety of conditions related to or affected by 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor activity, including psychoses (e.g., schizophrenia, anxiety, or depression), motor disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease), anxiety, depression, drug addiction, obsessive compulsive disorder, attention deficit disorder, or any condition which is known to be related to or affected by the 5-HT\n6 \nreceptor. These and other features of this invention will become more apparent by the detailed description set forth herein below.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides potent 5-HT\n6 \nantagonist compounds of Formula I:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein the constituent variables are as defined below.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention provides a compound of Formula II:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein the constituent variables are as defined below.\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention provides a compound of Formula III:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein the constituent variables are as defined below.\n\n\n\nAnother aspect of the invention provides a compound of Formula IV:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein the constituent variables are as defined below.\n\n\n\nIn other aspects, the invention provides compositions comprising a compound of the invention, and methods for making compounds of the invention.

In general, the number of carbon atoms present in a given group is designated “C\nx\n-C\ny\n”, where x and y are the lower and upper limits, respectively. For example, a group designated as “C\n1\n-C\n6\n” contains from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The carbon number as used in the definitions herein refers to carbon backbone and carbon branching, but does not include carbon atoms of the substituents, such as alkoxy substitutions and the like. Unless indicated otherwise, the nomenclature of substituents that are not explicitly defined herein are arrived at by naming from left to right the terminal portion of the functionality followed by the adjacent functionality toward the point of attachment. For example, the substituent “arylalkyloxycabonyl” refers to the group (C\n6\n-C\n14\naryl)-(C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl)-O—C(O)—. It is understood that the above definitions are not intended to include impermissible substitution patterns (e.g., methyl substituted with 5 fluoro groups, two hydroxyl groups on a single carbon atom, a hydroxyl group on a non-aromatic double bond). Such impermissible substitution patterns are well known to the skilled artisan. In each of the below groups, when a subgroup is designated with a multiple occurrence, each occurrence is selected independently. For example, in di(C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl)amino—e.g. (C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl)\n2\nN—, the C\n1\n-C\n6\nalkyl groups can be the same or different.\n\n\n“Activating” a compound refers to reacting the compound at a center with a reagent to introduce at the center an activating group, wherein the activating group is optionally converted to another activating group in one or more steps. Examples of activating include halogenation at a carbon center, optionally followed by hydroboration wherein the halogen group is converted to an optionally substituted borane; tosylation, mesylation, or triflation at an oxygen center; and nitration at a carbon center optionally followed by reduction of the nitro group to an amino group and conversion of the amino group to a diazo group.\n\n\n“Activating group” is a group that, when bound to a center, increases the reactivity at that center. Non-limiting examples of an activating group include a substituent bound to an electrophilic center and capable of being displaced by a nucleophile; a substituent bound to a nucleophilic center and capable of being displaced by an electrophile; a substituent capable of being displaced by a radical; or a substituent bound to a center wherein, following gain or loss of an electron, the substituent is capable of leaving as an anion or cation with formation of a radical at the center.\n\n\n“Acyl-” refers to a group having a straight, branched, or cyclic configuration or a combination thereof, attached to the parent structure through a carbonyl functionality. Such groups may be saturated or unsaturated, aliphatic or aromatic, and carbocyclic or heterocyclic. The carbon count includes the carbonyl carbon atom. Examples of a C\n1\n-C\n8\nacyl-group include HC(O)—, acetyl-, benzoyl-, p-toluoyl, nicotinoyl-, propionyl-, isobutyryl-, oxalyl-, and the like. Lower-acyl- refers to acyl groups containing one to four carbons.

In such cases, the maximum number of such substitutions is three. For example, serial substitutions of substituted aryl groups with two other substituted aryl groups are limited to substituted aryl-(substituted aryl)-substituted aryl.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention exhibit a 5-HT\n6 \nmodulating activity and, therefore, can be utilized in order to treat a patient suffering from a central nervous system (CNS) disease or disorder comprising administering to the subject a compound described herein, particularly a compound of Formulas I-IV.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the (CNS) disease or disorder is psychoses, anxiety, depression, epilepsy obsessive compulsive disorders, migraine, cognitive disorders, sleep disorders, feeding disorders, anorexia, bulimia, binge eating disorders, panic attacks, disorders resulting from withdrawal from drug abuse, schizophrenia, gastrointestinal disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, memory disorders, cognitive dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, neurodegenerative diseases characterized by impaired neuronal growth, or pain.\n\n\nAnother embodiment of the invention provides a method for improving or stabilizing cognitive function in a subject comprising administering to the subject a compound described herein, particularly a compound of Formulas I-IV or a tautomer, stereoisomer, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the cognitive function is stabilized or improved in a subject is suffering from schizophrenia.\n\n\nFor therapeutic use, the pharmacologically active compounds of any of the Formulas I-IV will normally be administered as a pharmaceutical composition comprising as the (or an) essential active ingredient at least one such compound in association with a solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, optionally, with pharmaceutically acceptable adjutants and excipients employing standard and conventional techniques.\n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of this invention include suitable dosage forms for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal and intravenous) bronchial or nasal administration. Thus, if a solid carrier is used, the preparation may be made into tablets, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form, or in the form of a troche or lozenge. The solid carrier may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, lubricants used to make tablets, disintegrants, wetting agents and the like. The tablet may, if desired, be film coated by conventional techniques. If a liquid carrier is employed, the preparation may be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile vehicle for injection, an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspension, or may be a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Liquid preparations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, wetting agents, non-aqueous vehicle (including edible oils), preservatives, as well as flavoring and/or coloring agents. For parenteral administration, a vehicle normally will comprise sterile water, at least in large part, although saline solutions, glucose solutions and like may be utilized. Injectable suspensions also may be used, in which case conventional suspending agents may be employed. Conventional preservatives, buffering agents and the like also may be added to the parenteral dosage forms. Particularly useful is the administration of a compound of any of the Formulas I-IV directly in parenteral formulations. The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by conventional techniques appropriate to the desired preparation containing appropriate amounts of the active ingredient, that is, the compound of any of the Formulas I-IV according to the invention. See, for example, \nRemington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, \n20th Edition. Baltimore, Md.: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2000.\n\n\nThe dosage of the compounds of any of the Formulas I-IV to achieve a therapeutic effect will depend not only on such factors as the age, weight and sex of the patient and mode of administration, but also on the degree of potassium channel activating activity desired and the potency of the particular compound being utilized for the particular disorder of disease concerned. It is also contemplated that the treatment and dosage of the particular compound may be administered in unit dosage form and that one skilled in the art would adjust the unit dosage form accordingly to reflect the relative level of activity. The decision as to the particular dosage to be employed (and the number of times to be administered per day is within the discretion of the physician, and may be varied by titration of the dosage to the particular circumstances of this invention to produce the desired therapeutic effect.\n\n\nA suitable dose of a compound of any of the Formulas I-IV or pharmaceutical composition thereof for a mammal, including man, suffering from, or likely to suffer from any condition as described herein is an amount of active ingredient from about 0.01 .mg/kg to 10 mg/kg body weight. For parenteral administration, the dose may be in the range of 0.1 .mg/kg to 1 mg/kg body weight for intravenous administration. For oral administration, the dose may be in the range about 0.1 .mg/kg to 5 mg/kg body weight. The active ingredient will preferably be administered in equal doses from one to four times a day. However, usually a small dosage is administered, and the dosage is gradually increased until the optimal dosage for the host under treatment is determined.\n\n\nHowever, it will be understood that the amount of the compound actually administered will be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances including the condition to be treated, the choice of compound of be administered, the chosen route of administration, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, and the severity of the patient's symptoms.\n\n\nThe amount of the compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof is an amount that is effective for modulating 5-HT\n6 \nactivity in a subject. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed can also depend on the route of administration, the condition, the seriousness of the condition being treated, as well as various physical factors related to the individual being treated, and can be decided according to the judgment of a health-care practitioner. Equivalent dosages may be administered over various time periods including, but not limited to, about every 2 hours, about every 6 hours, about every 8 hours, about every 12 hours, about every 24 hours, about every 36 hours, about every 48 hours, about every 72 hours, about every week, about every two weeks, about every three weeks, about every month, and about every two months. The number and frequency of dosages corresponding to a completed course of therapy will be determined according to the judgment of a health-care practitioner. The effective dosage amounts described herein refer to total amounts administered; that is, if more than one compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered, the effective dosage amounts correspond to the total amount administered.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered concurrently with another therapeutic agent.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, a composition comprising an effective amount of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and an effective amount of another therapeutic agent within the same composition can be administered.\n\n\nEffective amounts of the other therapeutic agents are well known to those skilled in the art. However, it is well within the skilled artisan's purview to determine the other therapeutic agent's optimal effective amount range. The compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and the other therapeutic agent can act additively or, in one embodiment, synergistically. In one embodiment, of the invention, where another therapeutic agent is administered to an animal, the effective amount of the compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is less than its effective amount would be where the other therapeutic agent is not administered. In this case, without being bound by theory, it is believed that the compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and the other therapeutic agent act synergistically.\n\n\nIn another aspect of the invention, kits that include one or more compounds of the invention are provided. Representative kits include a 5-HT\n6 \ninhibitor compound of the invention (e.g., a compound of Formulas I-IV) and a package insert or other labeling including directions for treating a CNS disease by administering an effective amount of a compound of the present invention.\n\n\nThe Scheme shown in Scheme 1 below, and the Preparations following the Scheme describe the procedures used to synthesize the compounds of the present invention. Reasonable variations of the described procedures, which would be evident to one skilled in the art, are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds 6 can be prepared via either method A or method B. In an example of method A, N-(3-nitrophenyl)acetamide was nitrated according to a literature procedure to give 2,3-dinitroaniline (2). Subsequently, compound 2 was converted to 2,3-dinitrobromobenzene with sodium nitrite and copper bromide. The latter intermediate was reacted with Boc-piperazine to give the desired product 3. Reduction of intermediate 3 gave the corresponding aniline 6. Alternatively, compound 6 can be prepared in two steps, as an example from commercially available 2,6-difluoronitrobenzene.\n\n\nReaction of compound 4 with sodium azide and Boc-piperazine gave intermediate 5. Subsequent reduction of compound 5 led to the formation of product 6. The benzimidazole core 7 can be prepared under different conditions established in the literature, such as heating compound 6 in toluene in the presence of montmorillonite KSF and triethyl orthoformate. The sulfone intermediate 8 can be prepared from the reaction of compound 7 with the appropriate substituted aryl sulfone. Deprotection and subsequent reductive amination of compound 8 with the appropriate aldehyde gave the desired compounds of Formula I. Alternatively, compounds of Formula I can be prepared from intermediate 10, which in turn results from the reaction of intermediate 9 with bis(2-chloroethyl)alkylamine.\n\n\nOne of skill in the art will recognize that Scheme 1 can be adapted to produce the other compounds of Formulas I-IV and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of Formulas I-IV according to the present invention.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nThe following abbreviations are used herein and have the indicated definitions: ACN is acetonitrile, AcOH is acetic acid, BINAP is 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphthalene, and BOC is t-butoxycarbonyl.

The pellets are gently resuspended with enough PBS buffer containing MgCl\n2 \nand CaCl\n2\n, (GIBCO 14040-133) to achieve a final concentration of ˜40×10\n6 \ncells/ml. The cell suspension is aliquoted into microfuge tubes, centrifuged at 2000 rpms for 10 min, supernatant discarded and stored as dry pellets at −80° C. Protein is measured in 5 μl lysate mixed with 200 μl diluted Bradford reagent, using Bovine Plasma Gamma globulin as a standard.\n\n\nBinding experiments are performed in a total volume of 200 μl using a 96 well microtiter plate format (Packard Optiplate). On the day of the assay, the cells were thawed and resuspended with enough assay buffer (i.e. PBS containing MgCl\n2 \nand CaCl\n2\n, (GIBCO 14040-133) supplemented with additional MgCl\n2 \nto achieve a final concentration of 10 mM) to achieve 40-80 μg or 100-200 K cells/well. To each well of the microtiter plate, 20 μl of 10× test compound in water containing 3.3% DMSO, 3 nM of [\n3\nH]-LSD (GE, SA: 80 Ci/mmol), cells and assay buffer are combined to achieve a volume of 150 Assay buffer and 10 μM cold methiothepin are substituted for the test compound in separate wells to define ‘total’ and ‘nonspecific’ binding, respectively. The incubation period is initiated by the addition of 50 μl of 10 mg/ml PVT WGA SPA beads (RPNQ0060, Amersham GE Healthcare) mixed in assay buffer for a final concentration of 1 mg/well. The plates are sealed and gently shaken at room temperature using an orbital shaker (setting 1.5) until equilibrium is achieved (2-6 hours). Radioactivity (CPM) is measured by Packard TopCount (1 min counting time/well).\n\n\nSpecific binding is described as the total radioactivity bound less the amount bound in the presence of 10 μM methiothepin, referred to as nonspecific binding (NSB). Binding in the presence of varying concentrations of test compounds is expressed as percent of specific binding in the absence of compound:\n\n\n{(Bound−NSB)/(Total−NSB)}×100=% Total\n\n\n\nRegression analysis of % bound data from ten concentrations is performed in GraphPad Prism, XL Fit or equivalent software. IC\n50 \nvalues are calculated using a four-parameter logistic curve fitting model and Ki values are calculated by the Cheng-Prusoff equation below:\n\n\n\nKi=IC\n \n50\n/(1+\nL/Kd\n)\n\n\nwhere L is the nM concentration of the radioactive ligand used and the Kd is the dissociation constant of the ligand for the receptor. The Kd for [\n3\nH]-LSD in the SPA binding format is ˜3 nM.\n\n\n\nReferring to the examples that follow, compounds of the present invention were synthesized using the methods described herein, or other methods, which are known in the art.

Description\n\n\n\n\nThe present invention relates to novel tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and to their use in therapy, in particular to their use for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer.\n\n\nThe estrogen receptor (ER) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. Estrogens play an important role in the regulation of a number of physiological processes, both in females and males. In humans, two different ER subtypes are known: ERα and ERβ, each with a distinct tissue distribution and with different biological roles. ERα has high presence in endometrium, breast cancer cells, ovarian stroma cells and in the hypothalamus. The expression of the ERβ protein has been documented in kidney, brain, bone, heart, lungs, intestinal mucosa, prostate, bladder, ovary, testis and endothelial cells. Subtype-selective ligands may therefore have attractive therapeutic applications in these tissues and organs (for a review see: J. W. Ullrich and C. P. Miller, \nExpert Opin. Ther. Patents, \n16 (2006) 559-572).\n\n\nBenign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, is a common disorder in elderly men. The condition is characterized by a progressive enlargement of prostatic tissue, resulting in obstruction of the proximal urethra and causing urinary flow disturbances. BPH is associated with both obstructive and irritative voiding symptoms, with bladder outlet obstruction as the most prominent symptom. Obstructive symptoms include straining, hesitancy, decreased force and caliber of the urine stream, an intermittent stream, a sense of incomplete emptying, and terminal dribbling. Irritative symptoms include urinary frequency, urgency, and nocturia. The occurrence of an enlargement of the prostate is thought to be related to many factors, but the presence of androgens in the prostate is a prerequisite. In addition, estrogens also play an important role in proliferation in the prostate. J. Cheng et al. in \nFEBS Lett. \n566 (2004) 169-172, suggested that ERβ-selective agonists might be used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer by inhibiting cell proliferation. Aging βERKO (ERβ knock out) mice develop prostate hyperplasia (O. Imamov et al., \nPNAS \n101 (2004) 9375-9380) and upon estradiol treatment these βERKO mice develop prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions (precursor of prostate cancer). The αERKO (ERα knock out) mice, on the other hand, do not develop prostate hyperplasia and PIN lesions upon estradiol treatment (G. P. Risbridger et al., \nJ. Molecular Endocrinology \n39 (2007) 183-188). This finding confirms the protective role of ERβ in the prostate.\n\n\nThe aromatase knock-out (ARKO) mice develop significant prostate hyperplasia. Recently, it was shown that treatment of ARKO mice with an ERβ-selective agonist reduced the hyperplastic lesions in the prostate (see S. J. Ellem and G. P. Risbridger, \nNature Rev. Cancer, \n7 (2007) 621-627). The authors also suggested a possible protective role for ERβ-selective agonists in prostate cancer. Indeed treatment of ARKO mice with estradiol increased PIN lesions, whereas treatment with an ERβ-selective agonist did not result in PIN lesions. The precursor lesion for prostate cancer is high grade PIN, a form of hyperplasia in the peripheral zone of the prostate. Therefore, ERβ-selective agonists might also be used as a treatment for patients with high grade PIN to prevent or delay the onset of prostate cancer. Moreover, another study demonstrated that the presence of ERβ prevented prostate cancer in a preclinical prostate cancer model (I. M. Coleman et al., \nNeoplasia \n8 (2006) 862-878). It has also been described that ERβ is expressed in prostate cancer metastasis and especially bone, suggesting a protective role of ERβ in prostate cancer bone metastasis (I. Leav et al., \nAm. J. Pathol. \n159 (2001) 79-92).\n\n\nProstate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men. Prostate carcinoma originates in the peripheral zone of the prostate. The process of carcinogenesis occurs in epithelial tissue and is initiated following genetic damage to the epithelial cells. Sex steroids play a key role in prostate cancer progression, especially the 17β-estradiol/testosterone (E2/T) ratio.\n\n\nThe process of prostate carcinogenesis occurs with long latency periods. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), a precursor of prostate cancer, has been observed in young men. Progression of PIN to high grade PIN may take another 10 years. After this, it may take several years for metastatic cancer to develop. High grade PIN predominantly occurs in the peripheral zone of the prostate, where 70% of prostate cancers arise. The long latent period provides important opportunity to prevent the development of invasive metastasis cancer (bone cancer is a common prostate cancer metastasis). However, due to the long latency period some men may never be treated for prostate cancer and eventually die of other causes. Drug therapy aims to inhibit the growth of androgen-dependent tumors and to prevent their progression into hormone-independent metastasis stages. Androgen ablation therapy has been shown to produce the most beneficial effect in patients with hormone-responsive prostate tumors (grade III and metastatic tumors). However, hormone therapy frequently results in hormone refractory prostate tumors after approximately 3-5 years of treatment.\n\n\nThus, although there are a number of treatments available for BPH and prostate cancer, there remains a need for alternative compounds and treatments.\n\n\nThe use of ERβ-selective ligands for other therapeutic indications has also been implicated. The specific activity of ERβ in the regulation of hot flushes has been described (E. E. Opas et al., \nMaturitas, \n53 (2006) 210-216; D. Grady et al., \nMenopause, \n16 (2009) 458-465).\n\n\nThe specific antianxiety behavioral effect of ERβ has been described (A. A. Walf and C. A. Frye, \nNeuropsychopharmacology, \n30 (2005) 1598-1609). Moreover, a potential beneficial effect of ERβ on depressive behavior was observed (A. A. Walf et al., \nPharmacol. Biochem. Behav., \n78 (2004) 523-529).\n\n\nIntroduction of ERβ in the breast cancer cell line T47D, was shown to inhibit tumor growth by inhibiting angiogenesis (J. Hartman et al., \nCancer Res., \n66 (2006) 11207-11213).\n\n\nInfection of ER-negative medullary thyroid carcinoma TT cells with ERβ suppressed the growth of these cells. Furthermore, apoptosis was detected in the ERβ-infected cells (M. A. Cho et al., \nJournal of Endocrinology, \n195 (2007) 255-263).\n\n\nA role for ERβ in folliculogenesis has also been described, since ERβ knock out mice displayed fewer corpora lutea than their wild type counterparts (H. A. Harris, \nMol. Endocrinol., \n21 (2007) 1-13).\n\n\nIn ovarian cancer, a link was made between loss of ERβ expression and malignant transformation. ERβ expression was significantly higher in stage I disease compared with stage II-IV disease. A higher ERβ expression was found to be significantly associated with a longer disease-free survival as well as overall survival (K. K. L. Chan et al., \nObstet. Gynecol., \n111 (2008) 144-151). Moreover, introduction of ERβ in an ovarian cancer cell line reduced proliferation and invasion and increased cellular apoptosis (G. Lazennec, \nCancer Lett., \n231 (2006), 151-157).\n\n\nIt has been shown that an ERβ-selective ligand treated chronic intestinal inflammation in HLA-B27 mice and was effective at reducing joint swelling in an adjuvant-induced rheumatoid arthritis model (H. A. Harris et al., \nEndocrinology, \n144 (2003) 4241-4249) and therefore has therapeutic potential in inflammatory bowel disease and/or arthritis.\n\n\nThis anti-inflammatory effect of ERβ-selective ligands has also been demonstrated in another model for chronic inflammation. An ERβ-selective compound reduced endometrial lesions in an experimentally induced endometriosis model (H. A. Harris et al., \nHum. Reprod., \n20 (2005) 936-941).\n\n\nThe protective role of ERβ in colon cancer has been described by O. Wada-Hiraike et al. in \nBiochem. Soc. Trans., \n34 (2006) 1114-1116).\n\n\nSelective estrogen receptor β (ERβ) compounds are known in the prior art. WO 01/64665 discloses chroman derivatives, which are shown to be selective agonists for ERβ over ERα. These compounds are described to be useful in estrogen receptor-related medical treatments, such as those for contraception or for treatment or prevention of benign prostate hypertrophy, cardiovascular disorders, menopausal complaints, osteoporosis, estrogen dependent tumour control or central nervous system disorders such as depression or Alzheimer's disease. They are particularly suitable for the treatment of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disorders, prostate disorders and central nervous system disorders such as depression or Alzheimer's disease, but no biological activity data on any of these therapeutic indications are provided.\n\n\nCompounds with a 1-benzyl-3-phenyl-tetralone (or tetrahydronaphthalene) skeleton, analogous to the chroman derivatives disclosed in WO 01/64665, have been mentioned in EP 00200713.6, but no specific examples of such compounds have actually been disclosed therein.\n\n\nWO 03/044006 discloses substituted benzopyrans as selective estrogen receptor β agonists, which are described to be useful in the treatment of prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, urinary incontinence, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, gastrointestinal (GI) tract disorders, and osteoporosis. The selectivity of said benzopyrans for ERβ over ERα is low. No in vivo data are shown.\n\n\nWO 2006/088716 discloses substituted tetralins as selective estrogen receptor β agonists, which are described to be useful in the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy, obesity, dementia, hypertension, incontinence, colon cancer, prostate cancer, infertility, depression, leukemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and arthritis. No data for the selectivity of said tetralins for ERβ over ERα and no in vivo data are shown.\n\n\nThe present invention provides a series of tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives, more in particular 6-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives, which are selective ERβ agonists and which can be used inter alia for the prevention or treatment of LUTS, BPH, and prostate cancer, of the following Formula 1\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n \n \nR1 is (C1-C4)alkyl, (C2-C4)alkenyl or (C2-C4)alkynyl, independently optionally substituted with one or more halogen, R1 having a cis-orientation in relation to both the exocyclic phenyl group at the 6-position and the benzyl group at the 8-position of the skeleton;\n \nR2-R13 are independently H, halogen, CN, OH, (C1-C4)alkyl, optionally substituted with one or more halogen or (C1-C2)alkoxy;\n\n\nor a prodrug or an isotopically-labelled derivative thereof.\n\n \n\n\nThe compounds of this invention contain three centers of chirality and because of the cis-orientation of the substituents at C6, C7 and C8 of the tetrahydro-naphthalen-2-ol skeleton, can exist as a racemic mixture of enantiomers, containing substantially equal amounts of the two enantiomers, as mixtures of enantiomers in any proportions or as the pure enantiomers. The present invention includes the aforementioned mixtures and racemic mixtures within its scope and each of the individual (+) and (−) enantiomers substantially free of the other enantiomer, i.e. an enantiomer associated with less than 5%, preferably less than 2%, in particular less than 1% of the other enantiomer.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention show a surprisingly high metabolic stability in human hepatocytes, in particular when compared to corresponding chroman compounds, some of which compounds are disclosed in WO 01/64665. Drugs are most often eliminated from the body by biotransformation and/or excretion into bile or urine. The liver is the major organ for biotransformation of xenobiotics. Biotransformation is achieved via two major enzymatic routes in the liver: structural modification (Phase I metabolism) or conjugation (Phase II metabolism). A reduced rate of metabolism (i.e. higher metabolic stability) will result in higher and more prolonged plasma levels of a drug.\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention are subtype-selective estrogen receptor β (ERβ) agonists with high selectivity over the estrogen receptor α (ERα). The presence of ERα agonistic activity in a drug will contribute to unwanted ERα-mediated side effects, like feminization. When drugs have reduced ERβ agonistic selectivity over ERα, the ERα-mediated side effects will become apparent at lower doses. Thus, drugs are preferred with highest ERβ agonistic selectivity over ERα.\n\n\nThe skeleton of the compounds in this invention contains three chiral centres, with an all-cis configuration. Such compounds can exist as two different enantiomers, which are 3-dimensional mirror images of each other. In one enantiomer the three chiral centres are all directed upwards relative to the plain of the scaffold and in the other enantiomer they are all directed downwards. The single enantiomer with highest activity on a biological target is defined as the eutomer on that target; the enantiomer with the lowest activity is defined as the distomer on that target. The ratio of the activities of the eutomer and the distomer is called the eudismic ratio. We observed that for the compounds of the present invention, the eutomers on ERβ have relatively low ERα agonistic activity, whereas the distomers on ERβ have relatively high ERα agonistic activity. In other words, for the compounds in accordance with the present invention we found, unexpectedly, that the eudismic ratio on ERβ is (much) higher than on ERα. Thus, unexpectedly, the eutomers have higher ERβ agonistic selectivity over ERα than the distomers.\n\n\nThus, in a further embodiment of the present invention a series of tetrahydro-naphthalen-2-ol derivatives of the following Formula 2 is provided, with the indicated absolute stereochemistry\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n \n \nR1 is (C1-C4)alkyl, (C2-C4)alkenyl or (C2-C4)alkynyl, independently optionally substituted with one or more halogen, R1 having a cis-orientation in relation to both the exocyclic phenyl group at the 6-position and the benzyl group at the 8-position of the skeleton;\n \nR2-R13 are independently H, halogen, CN, OH, (C1-C4)alkyl, optionally substituted with one or more halogen or (C1-C2)alkoxy;\n\n\nor a prodrug or an isotopically-labelled derivative thereof.\n\n \n\n\nThe alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl group may be linear or branched. Suitable examples include methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tertiary butyl, ethenyl, propen-2-yl, ethynyl and propynyl. Halogen means fluorine, chorine, bromine and iodine, in particular fluorine and chlorine. A particularly suitable (C1-C4)alkyl group substituted with one or more halogen is a trifluoromethyl group.\n\n\nIn one embodiment of the present invention, R1 is (C1-C4)alkyl, optionally substituted with one or more halogen.\n\n\nA prodrug is defined as being a compound which is converted in the body of a recipient to a compound as defined by Formula 1. Notably, the hydroxyl groups at the 6-phenyl substituent or at the 2-position of the skeleton of Formula 1 can for example be substituted by an alkyl, alkenyl, acyl, aroyl, alkoxycarbonyl, alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl, alkylsulfamate, arylsulfamate, phosphate group or glycosyl group, whereby the carbon chain length is not considered to be sharply delimited, while aroyl and aryl generally will comprise a phenyl, pyridinyl or pyrimidinyl, which groups can have substitutions customary in the art, such as alkyl, hydroxy, halogen, nitro, cyano, and (mono-, or dialkyl)amino groups. The carbon chain length is selected depending on the desired properties of the prodrugs, whereby the longer chained prodrugs with for example lauryl or caproyl chains generally are more suitable for sustained release and depot preparations. It is known that such substituents spontaneously hydrolyze or are enzymatically hydrolyzed to the free hydroxyl substituents on the skeleton of the compound. Such prodrugs will have biological activity comparable to the compounds to which they are converted in the body of the recipients. The active compound to which a prodrug is converted is called the parent compound. The onset of action and duration of action as well as the distribution in the body of a prodrug may differ from such properties of the parent compound. Also the resulting plasma concentration of the parent compound after administration of the prodrug may differ from the resulting plasma concentration after direct administration of the parent compound. For other types of prodrugs it should be realized that the hydroxyl groups in compounds according to Formula 1 can be placed in position by the metabolic system of the recipient. The hydroxyl groups give an important contribution to the affinity for the estrogen receptor. Thus, compounds as defined by Formula 1, but lacking one or both hydroxyl groups are also made available as compounds according to this invention, and which compounds are referred to as prodrugs.\n\n\nIn one embodiment, the hydroxyl group at the 6-phenyl substituent and/or at the 2-position of the skeleton of Formula 1 is substituted with a (C1-C8)alkyl, (C1-C18)acyl, glucosyl or glucuronyl group, in a further embodiment with a (C1-C4)alkyl, (C1-C8)acyl or glucuronyl group. Representative examples of such prodrugs are described in Tables 2 and 4 hereinbelow.\n\n\nProdrugs of tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives of Formula 1 may be prepared to increase their aqueous solubility in order to facilitate pharmaceutical formulation and/or to improve bioavailability following various routes of administration (e.g. intestinal absorption after oral administration). Such solubilizing prodrugs are well known to those of skill in the art. Representative examples of this approach can be found in V. J. Stella and W. N.-A. Kwame, \nAdvanced Drug Delivery Reviews, \n59 (2007) 677-694.\n\n\nThe present invention also embraces isotopically-labelled derivatives of any of the compounds according to Formula 1, which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the present invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine, chlorine and iodine, such as \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n11\nC, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\nP, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, \n36\nCl and \n123\nI, respectively. Certain isotopically-labelled derivatives of the compounds of Formula 1 (e.g. those labelled with \n3\nH and \n14\nC) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e. \n3\nH) and carbon-14 (i.e. \n14\nC) isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula 1 can be useful for medical imaging purposes. E.g., those labelled with positron-emitting isotopes like \n11\nC or \n18\nF can be useful for application in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and those labelled with gamma ray emitting isotopes like \n123\nI can be useful for application in Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e. \n2\nH) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g. increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula 1, in particular those containing isotopes with longer half lives (T½>1 day), can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples hereinbelow, by substituting an appropriate isotopically-labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives of Formula 1\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n \n \nR1 is (C1-C4)alkyl, (C2-C4)alkenyl or (C2-C4)alkynyl, independently optionally substituted with one or more halogen, R\n1 \nhaving a cis-orientation in relation to both the exocyclic phenyl group at the 6-position and the benzyl group at the 8-position of the skeleton;\n \nR2-R6 are independently H, halogen, CN, OH, (C1-C4)alkyl, optionally substituted with one or more halogen or (C1-C2)alkoxy, with a maximum of two OH groups;\n \nR7-R13 are independently H, halogen, CN, (C1-C4)alkyl, optionally substituted with one or more halogen or (C1-C2)alkoxy;\n\n\nor a prodrug thereof.\n\n \n\n\nIn yet another embodiment, the present invention provides tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives of Formula 1\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n \n \nR1 is (C1-C4)alkyl, (C2-C4)alkenyl or (C2-C4)alkynyl, independently optionally substituted with one or more halogen, R\n1 \nhaving a cis-orientation in relation to both the exocyclic phenyl group at the 6-position and the benzyl group at the 8-position of the skeleton;\n \nR2-R13 are independently H, halogen, CN, OH, (C1-C4)alkyl, optionally substituted with one or more halogen or (C1-C2)alkoxy, with a maximum of five R2-R13 groups unequal to H.\n \n\n\nIn a further embodiment of the present invention, there are from zero to three R2-R13 groups unequal to H, in particular from one to three R2-R13 groups unequal to H.\n\n\nIn another embodiment, the present invention provides tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives of Formula 1\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n \n \nR1 is methyl, ethyl or propyl;\n \nR2 is H, chlorine, fluorine, CN, methoxy or methyl;\n \nR3-R7 and R10 are H or fluorine;\n \nR8, R9, R11 and R13 are H;\n \nR12 is H, fluorine or methyl.\n \n\n\nIn a further embodiment of the present invention, the tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivative is selected from the group consisting of compounds according to Formula 1 wherein R1 is methyl, R2 is fluorine, and R3-R13 are H; R1 is ethyl, R2 is fluorine, and R3-R13 are H; R1 is methyl, R2 and R6 are fluorine, and R3-R5 and R7-R13 are H; R1 is methyl, R2 is CN, and R3-R13 are H; R1 is ethyl, R2 and R12 are fluorine, and R3-R11 and R13 are H; and R1 is ethyl, R4 is fluorine, and R2-R3 and R5-R13 are H.

In an even further embodiment of the present invention, the tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivative is a compound of Formula 2 wherein R1 is methyl, R2 is fluorine, and R3-R13 are H (i.e. compound 11a).\n\n\nThe compounds of the present invention can be produced by various methods known in the art of organic chemistry. The general synthetic procedures used to prepare the compounds described in the examples below are depicted in the following reaction schemes. Variations to these schemes can easily be made by one skilled in the art. In the following schemes, PG refers to any suitable protecting group and the R groups are as defined in Formula 1 or 2 above, and where needed the R group is capped with a suitable protecting group during the synthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8-Benzyl tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ols can be prepared as racemic mixtures according to Scheme 2, starting from appropriately substituted 4,4′-dimethoxybenzylphenyl ketones (which are also known as desoxyanisoin derivatives). Desoxyanisoin derivatives can be prepared in various manners as depicted in Scheme 1. In one method, 1,3-dithiane derivative 12 is deprotonated, followed by addition of benzyl bromide derivative 14, resulting in formation of compound 13. Upon reaction with periodic acid, the 1,3-dithiane moiety is converted to a carbonyl group resulting in formation of desoxyanisoin derivative 1. In an alternative approach, (un)substituted methoxybenzene 15 is reacted with acid chloride derivative 16 in a Friedel-Crafts reaction to give desoxyanisoin derivative 1.\n\n\nDesoxyanisoin derivative 1 can be reacted with an alkyl bromoacetate in a Reformatsky reaction to give, after dehydration, compound 2 (see Scheme 2). Subsequently, the position alpha to the carbonyl can be alkylated by treatment with base and an alkylating agent (X=halogen, alkylsulfonate, arylsulfonate, or other leaving group). After reduction of the stilbene-type double bond compound 3 is obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, compound 3 can be prepared directly from compound 1 by reaction with an α-bromo,α-alky ester 17 that already contains substituent R1, followed by elimination of water and reduction of the stilbene-type double bond, as depicted in Scheme 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder acidic conditions compound 3 can be cyclized to tetralone 4 (see Scheme 2). Tetralone 4 can be converted to enol triflate 5 by reaction with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride. Enol triflate 5 can be converted to compound 7 by a palladium- or nickel-catalyzed coupling reaction with organometallic reagent 6 (M=Zn, Mg; X=halogen). Reduction of the non-aromatic double bond in 7 can be achieved by Pd-catalyzed hydrogenation to give compound 8. The protecting groups in compound 8 can be removed by various methods known in the art of organic chemistry, depending of the nature of the applied protecting groups. For example, when PG=methyl, removal of the protecting groups can be achieved by reaction with boron tribromide to afford the bis-phenolic compound 9, as a racemic mixture of enantiomers.\n\n\nCompounds 9 in which R1 is (C2-C4)alkenyl or (C2-C4)alkynyl can be prepared from corresponding compounds 9 in which R1 is 2-fluoroethyl, which can be synthesized according to Scheme 2. The fluoroethyl group can subsequently be converted to alkenyl or alkynyl groups by various methods known in the art of organic chemistry, for example by conversion of 2-fluoroethyl to 2-bromoethyl followed by elimination of HBr to give compound 9 in which R1 is ethenyl. Alternatively, the 2-bromoethyl substituent can undergo a substitution reaction with an organometallic reagent to introduce an alkenyl or alkynyl group. Alternatively, alkenyl groups may be converted to alkynyl groups by an oxidative procedure.\n\n\nThe reactions in Schemes 1, 2 and 3 are generally performed whilst the phenolic OH groups are protected with a suitable protecting group (PG). For example, methyl can be used as the protecting group. The PG may be removed in the final step leading to compound 9 (as in Scheme 2) or may be removed at an earlier stage in the synthetic sequence. For example, deprotection may be performed at the stage of compound 5. In case PG=methyl, deprotection of compound 5 may be achieved by reaction with boron tribromide to give unprotected bisphenol 20 (see Scheme 4). Compound 20 can be converted to compound 7 (PG=H) and subsequently compound 8 (PG=H) in the same manner as indicated in Scheme 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe enantiomers of compound 9 may be separated in a conventional way by chiral HPLC using an appropriate chiral HPLC column, for example a Chiralpak AD, OD or AS column, to give single enantiomers 11 and 12, as depicted in Scheme 5.\n\n\nIn an alternative approach, racemic compound 9 is first converted to bis-acetyl compound 10, which is then separated by chiral HPLC to give single enantiomers 21 and 22. Saponification of the acetyl functionalities of compounds 21 and 22, for example by reaction with lithium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide, gives bisphenols 11 (eutomers) and 12 (distomers) as single enantiomers (see Scheme 5).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sequence of reaction steps starting from compound 7 to yield compounds 11 and 12, as indicated in Schemes 2 and 5, may also be altered, in that compound 7 can also first be deprotected to give bisphenolic compound 23, which may then be acetylated to give compound 24, followed by hydrogenation to give compound 10 as a racemate (see Scheme 6).\n\n\nEster prodrugs can be made of the parent compounds by esterification of free hydroxyl groups, for example by reaction with an appropriate acid anhydride in pyridine. Thus, compounds 21 and 22 are ester prodrugs of the bisphenols 11 and 12.\n\n\nThe tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives of the present invention are selective ERβ agonists (see Table 7 below). The eutomer compounds 11 show the highest receptor activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a further aspect, the tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivatives of the present invention and their prodrugs or isotopically-labelled derivatives thereof are useful in therapy.

With a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is meant one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.\n\n\nThe present invention also relates to a method of preventing or treating lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostate hyperplasia, prostate cancer, hot flushes, anxiety, depression, breast cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma, ovarian cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, endometriosis, and colon cancer, in particular lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostate hyperplasia, prostate cancer, breast cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, and colon cancer, more in particular lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer, even more particular prostate cancer, comprising administering therapeutically effective amounts of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivative in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient in accordance with the present invention to a mammal in need thereof.\n\n\nIn a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to the use of the tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivative of Formula 2 wherein R1 is methyl, R2 is fluorine, and R3-R13 are H (i.e. compound 11a), for the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of prostate cancer.\n\n\nThe amount of a tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ol derivative of the present invention, also referred to herein as the active ingredient, which is required to achieve a therapeutic effect will, of course, vary with the particular compound, the route of administration, the age and condition of the recipient and the particular disorder or disease being treated.\n\n\nThe exact dose and regimen of administration of the active ingredient, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof, may vary with the particular compound, the route of administration, and the age and condition of the individual subject to whom the medicament is to be administered.\n\n\nIn general, parenteral administration requires lower dosages than other methods of administration which are more dependent upon absorption. However, a suitable dosage for humans may be 0.0001-5 mg per kilogram body weight, more in particular 0.001-1 mg per kilogram body weight. The desired dose may be presented as one dose or as multiple subdoses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day or as doses to be administered at appropriate daily intervals. It may also be administered once-a-week or once-a-month.

mmol) was suspended in ethyl acetate (200 ml) and H\n2 \ngas was led through the suspension for 30 min. Compound 7a (15.90 g, 40.9 mmol) and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine (20.98 g, 110 mmol) was dissolved in 100 ml ethyl acetate and was added in 6 portions over a period of 2 h. The reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h under continuous bubbling of H\n2\n. Nitrogen was led through the reaction mixture for 30 min. The reaction mixture was filtered over decalite. The filtrate was concentrated to give a colorless oil. NMR showed 72% all cis product, 21% trans products and 7% of the naphthalene product. The crude oil was purified by silica gel chromatography (heptane/ethyl acetate 9/1) to give the compound 8a as a colorless oil (15.04 g, 52%). \n1\nH NMR (CDCl\n3\n): see Table 2.\n\n\nAccording to

dichloromethane (250 ml) to obtain a clear colorless solution. This solution was cooled to 0° C. and then boron tribromide (25.3 ml, 263 mmol) was added carefully to give a brown solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h and then poured into ice water (250 ml) and extracted with dichloromethane (2×200 ml). The organic phases were combined, washed with a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (250 ml) and water (250 ml), dried with sodium sulfate and concentrated. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (toluene/ethyl acetate 95:5) to give compound 9a as a yellow oil (7.80 g, 73% yield). \n1\nH NMR (CDCl\n3\n): see Table 3.\n\n\nAccording to

Separation of 90 mg of racemate 9j afforded the single enantiomers 11j (18 mg, chemical purity 95.1%) and 12j (26 mg, chemical purity 97.9%). The enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of the enantiomers was determined on an analytical chiral HPLC column (Chiralpak AS 5μ; 20% isopropanol in heptane): compound 11j: retention time 33.67 min; e.e. 97.8%; compound 12j: retention time 19.67 min; e.e. 100%.\n\n\nExample 14\n\n\nProcedure for the Separation of the Enantiomers of Compounds 9 Via Conversion to Bisacetyl Analogues 10\n\n\nGeneral Procedure M (see Scheme 5)\n\n\nCompound 9a (5.3 g, 14.62 mmol) was dissolved in pyridine (59 ml) to give a colorless solution. Acetic anhydride (41 ml) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 16 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was poured into 4N hydrochloric acid (250 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3×50 ml). The intermediate was crystallized from ethanol (25 ml, heat to 80° C. and cool slowly with stirring) to give compound 10a as white crystals (4.68 g, 72%). \n1\nH NMR (CDCl\n3\n): δ 0.66 (d, J=7 Hz, 3H), 1.87 (m, 1H), 2.28 (s, 3H), 2.33 (s, 3H), 2.76 (dd, J1=11 Hz, J2=14 Hz, 1H), 2.94 (dd, J1=3 Hz, J2=14 Hz, 1H), 3.22 (m, 2H), 3.51 (dd, J1=5 Hz, J2=14 Hz, 1H), 3.60 (m, 1H), 6.91-7.31 (m, 11H).\n\n\nThe enantiomers of racemate 10a (4.6 g) were separated on a chiral HPLC column (Chiralpak OD 5μ; 5% isopropanol in heptane) to afford single enantiomers 21a (1.95 g; chemical purity 98%) and 22a (2.04 g; chemical purity 95%). The enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of the separated enantiomers was determined on an analytical chiral HPLC column (Chiralpak OD 5μ, 4% isopropanol/heptane): compound 21a: retention time 11.80 min; e.e. 100%; compound 22a: retention time 22.59 min; e.e. 97.9%.\n\n\nCompound 21a (1.95 g) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (60 ml). Lithium hydroxide monohydrate (1.10 g, 26.2 mmol) dissolved in water (2 ml), was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature under nitrogen. Water (100 ml) was added and the intermediate was extracted with ethyl acetat (3×50 ml). The organic layer was dried with sodium sulfate filtered and concentrated. The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC (reversed phase acetonitrile/water 40-60) and freeze dried to give the compound 11a as white solid (1.22 g, 3.36 mmol, 100% ee). The absolute stereochemistry of compound 11a was determined by Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy to be (6S, 7S, 8S).\n\n\nExample 15\n\n\n4-(6-Acetoxy-3-ethyl-4-(2-fluorobenzyl)-1,2-dihydronaphthalen-2-yl)phenyl acetate (compound 24)\n\n\nPrepared according to General Procedure M, starting from compound 23: 62% yield. \n1\nH NMR (CDCl\n3\n): δ 1.03 (t, J=9 Hz, 3H), 1.90 (m, 1H), 2.22 (s, 3H), 2.26 (s, 3H), 2.37 (m, 1H), 2.93 (dd, J1=3 Hz, J2=17 Hz, 1H), 3.34 (dd, J1=9 Hz, J2=17 Hz, 1H), 3.66 (dd, J1=3 Hz, J2=9 Hz, 1H), 3.93 (AB, J1=17 Hz, J2=42, 2H), 6.77 (dd, J1=3 Hz, J2=9 Hz, 1H), 6.83 (d, J=3 Hz, 1H), 6.98 (AB, J1=9 Hz, J2=82, 4H).\n\n\nAccording to General Procedure M (unless indicated otherwise) the compounds in Table 4 were prepared:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds prepared as described in General Procedure M.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nChiral\n\n\nHPLC\n\n\n \n\n\nChiral\n\n\nHPLC\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nretention\n\n\ntime\n\n\ne.e.\n\n\nretention\n\n\ntime\n\n\ne.e.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(racemate)\n\n\nName\n\n\nStructure\n\n\nenantiomer\n\n\n21\n\n\n(%)\n\n\nenantiomer\n\n\n22\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10a\n\n\n4-(6-acetoxy-4-(2-fluorobenzyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-yl)phenyl acetate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21a:\n\n\n11.80 (§)\n\n\n100\n\n\n22a:\n\n\n22.59 (§)\n\n\n97.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10b (\n )\n\n\n4-(6-acetoxy-4-(2-fluorobenzyl)-3-ethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-yl)phenyl acetate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21b:\n\n\n13.36 (#)\n\n\n100\n\n\n22b:\n\n\n19.92 (#)\n\n\n93.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n10i\n\n\n(4-(6-acetoxy-4-(2,6-difluorobenzyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-yl)phenyl acetate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21i:\n\n\n10.85 (#)\n\n\n100\n\n\n22i:\n\n\n16.94 (#)\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(§) HPLC retention time on Chiralpak OD 5μ column 4.6 × 250 mm (4% isopropanol/heptane, flow 1 ml/min)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(#) HPLC retention time on Chiralpak OD 5μ column 4.6 × 250 mm (3% ethanol/heptane, flow 1 ml/min)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n ) Prepared from compound 24 according to General Procedure J, followed by chiral HPLC separation of the enantiomers according to procedure H.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to General Procedure L or M the following compounds 11 and 12 were prepared:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompounds 11 prepared as described in General Procedure L or M.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nChiral HPLC\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nGeneral\n\n\nPurity\n\n\nretention\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompound\n\n\nName\n\n\nStructure\n\n\nProcedure\n\n\n(%)\n\n\ntime\n\n\ne.e.

Apoptotic cells show nuclear DNA fragmentation and the TUNEL assay end-labels the fragmented DNA by incorporating biotinylated dUTP at the 3′-OH DNA ends using the enzyme Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT). Positively stained cells are counted per acinus (glandular unit) in the ventral prostate. Proliferation of the acinar epithelium of the ventral prostate was determined by immunohistochemical staining with an antibody directed against Ki67 (clone Mib5). Positively stained cells are counted per acinus (glandular unit) in the ventral prostate. Statistical significance is determined as compared to TB alone by one-way ANOVA.\n\n\nFor compound 11a a statistically significant (p<0.01) increase in epithelial cell apoptosis was observed in this assay, with a minimal active dose (MAD) of 3 μg/kg. At this dose a decrease in epithelial cell proliferation was observed as compared to TB-alone treated rats.\n\n\nExample 18\n\n\nA number of compounds 9, 11 and 12 were tested on metabolic stability in human hepatocytes. The hepatic stability was compared to corresponding chroman compounds 25, 26 or 27 (see structures below).\n\n\nTest compounds were diluted to 3 μM in incubation medium. Then 40 μl of the 3 μM test compounds was pipetted into a 96 well microtiter plate (flat bottom). Hepatocytes (stored at −140° C.) were thawed in a 37° C. water bath. The cells were resuspended into pre-warmed thawing medium and were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 50 g at room temperature. The supernatant was discarded and the remaining cell pellet was resuspended in warm incubation medium and diluted to 7.5 E5 cells/ml. Then 80 μl of the cell suspension was added to each well of the 96 well microtiter plate containing the test compounds. The resulting mixture was incubated at 37° C. and was sampled at t=0, 5, 30, 60, and 120 min. The samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS to determine the content of unchanged test compound. Based on the rate of reduction of the content of test compound over time, the half-live (T½) was calculated. The hepatic stability is summarized in Table 8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetabolic stability in human hepatocytes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nHuman\n\n\n \n\n\nHuman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTetrahydro-\n\n\nhepatocyte\n\n\nChroman\n\n\nhepatocyte\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nnaphthalen-2-ol\n\n\nT ½  (min)\n\n\n(‡)\n\n\nT ½  (min)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9b\n\n\n70.0\n\n\n25b\n\n\n44.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9j\n\n\n37.4\n\n\n25j\n\n\n40.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9o\n\n\n73.2\n\n\n25o\n\n\n71.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9p\n\n\n>120\n\n\n25p\n\n\n48.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9r\n\n\n57.9\n\n\n25r\n\n\n24.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9s\n\n\n96.5\n\n\n25s\n\n\n56.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9v\n\n\n69.8\n\n\n25v\n\n\n53.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n9y\n\n\n109.6\n\n\n25v\n\n\n58.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11a\n\n\n40.5\n\n\n26a\n\n\n35.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11b\n\n\n40.7\n\n\n26b\n\n\n35.6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11i\n\n\n29.4\n\n\n26i\n\n\n26.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11q\n\n\n82.2\n\n\n26q\n\n\n45.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12a\n\n\n66.9\n\n\n27a\n\n\n33.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12i\n\n\n67.1\n\n\n27i\n\n\n45.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12i\n\n\n33.7\n\n\n27i\n\n\n24.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n12q\n\n\n>120\n\n\n27q\n\n\n47.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(‡) the one-letter extension in the codes of chromans 25, 26 and 27 indicates the substitution pattern of the compounds.
