Description\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to compounds which are ligands at the neuropeptide Y Y5 receptor, and as such are useful to treat disorders related to mood, stress, cognition, stress and dementia.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nNeuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36 amino acid neuropeptide expressed in the peripheral and central nervous system. This peptide is a member of the pancreatic polypeptide family, which also includes pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and peptide YY (PYY). Moreover, the biological effects of NPY are mediated through its interaction with receptors that belong in the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPresently, five NPY receptor subtypes have been cloned: Y1 (D. Larhammar, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1992, 267, 10935-10938); Y2 (C. Gerald, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, 26758-26761); Y4 (J. Bard, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, 26762-26765); Y5 (C. Gerald, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, 26758-26761); and y6 (P. Gregor, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1996, 271, 27776-27781). All these receptor subtypes are expressed in several species except for the y6 subtype, which has been shown to be expressed in mouse and rabbit but not in rat and primate. A Y3 subtype has been proposed based on pharmacological data. However, the Y3 subtype has yet to be cloned and its existence remains to be fully established.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNPY exerts numerous physiological effects. On the basis of animal studies, it is evident that a contributory relationship exists between NPY and its receptors with disorders such as depression, anxiety and obesity. For instance, NPY expression is shown to be sensitive to energy status while NPY administration reduces energy expenditure. Another significant ability of NPY is to acutely stimulate feeding (S. Kalra, et al., Endocr. Rev., 1999, 20, 68-100). The NPY Y5 receptor has also been shown to be a receptor subtype responsible for NPY-induced food intake (C. Gerald, et al., Nature, 1996, 382, 168-171).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe link between NPY and mood disorders such as depression and anxiety is established in the literature. For example, rats subjected to chronic mild stress exhibit anhedonia, a feature of clinical depression (P. Willner, et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1997, 340, 121-132); they also contain elevated levels of NPY mRNA in hypothalamus accompanied by a reduction in hippocampus (V. Sergeyev, et al., Psychopharmacology, 2005, 178, 115-124). The behavioral changes associated with chronic mild stress are reversed by a variety of antidepressants (P. Willner, et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1997, 340, 121-132). In one study of antidepressant therapies, rats treated with citalopram displayed an increased level of hippocampal NPY receptor binding with no change in NPY-like immunoreactivity (H. Husum, et al., Neuropsychopharmacology, 2001, 2, 183-191); conversely, electroconvulsive shock produced an increased level of hippocampal NPY-like immunoreactivity with no change in NPY receptor binding. These findings suggest that abnormal levels of NPY play a role in depressive illness, and that agents capable of regulating NPY and/or NPY receptor function particularly in limbic regions are useful for treating depression. Y5 is a NPY receptor expressed in limbic regions (M. Wolak, et al., J. Comp. Neurol., 2003, 22, 285-311; and K. Nichol, et al., J. Neurosci., 1999, 19, 10295-10304). Accordingly, agents capable of regulating Y5 receptor function are therefore predicted to be useful for treating depression.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnimal models of anxiety also reveal abnormal levels of NPY. In one example, maternally separated rats display an anxious and depressive phenotype throughout adulthood (R. Huot, Psychopharmacology, 2001, 158, 366-73); they also contain elevated levels of NPY-like immunoreactivity in hypothalamus accompanied by a reduction in hippocampus and cortex (P. Jimenez-Vasquez, Brain Res. Dev., 2001, 26, 149-152; H. Husum and A. Mathe, Neuropsychopharmacology, 2002 27:756-64; and H. Husum et al., Neurosci Lett., 2002, 333, 127-130). In a second example, rats subjected to fear conditioning display increased anxiety-like behavior; they also contain elevated levels of NPY in hypothalamus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens accompanied by a reduction in frontal cortex. The behavioral changes produced by fear conditioning can be reversed by treatment with anxiolytic drugs. In one study of fear conditioning, both the anxiety-like behavior and altered expression of NPY were reversed by treatment with diazepam (R. Krysiak, et al., Neuropeptides, 2000, 34, 148-57). These findings further suggest that NPY plays a role in anxiety, and that agents capable of regulating NPY and/or receptor function particularly in limbic regions are useful for treating anxiety. Y5 is a NPY receptor expressed in limbic regions (M. Wolak, et al., J. Comp. Neurol., 2003, 22, 285-311; and K. Nichol, et al., J. Neurosci., 1999, 19, 10295-10304). Accordingly, agents capable of regulating Y5 receptor function are therefore predicted to be useful for treating anxiety.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral groups disclose the nexus between the NPY Y5 receptor and sleep disorders related to circadian rhythm disruptions. This nexus is based on the discovery that NPY Y5 receptors mediate an important physiologic response in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus in response to the application of NPY. For example, WO 99/05911 and WO 05/30208 disclose this link and propose the use of NPY Y5 receptor ligands for treating sleep disorders. Accordingly, it is expected that the compounds of Formula I can be used for treating sleep disorders, which includes primary insomnia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical industry is also targeting NPY Y5 receptor antagonists as potential therapies for the treatment of cognitive impairment/dysfunction disorders. For example, the NPY Y5 receptor antagonist, MK-0557, is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia. In support of this indication, WO 03/51356 proposes that NPY Y5 receptor antagonism can be used to treat dementias. Accordingly, it is expected that the compounds of Formula I can used for treating cognitive impairment/dysfunction disorders such as cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS); schizophrenia; dementias; autism; ADHD; and Alzheimer's disease. The compounds of the invention are also expected to treat the positive and negative aspects of schizophrenia; dementias; autism; ADHD; and Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWO 02/28393 discloses methods of reducing self-administration of alcohol in a patient suffering from alcoholism comprising administering a NPY Y5 receptor antagonist. Accordingly, it is expected that the compounds of Formula I can used for treating substance dependency/abuse disorders such as alcoholism as well as nicotine and cocaine addictions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, it is expected that the compounds of Formula I can be used for treating metabolic disorders such as dyslipidemia; hyperlipidemia; insulin hyposensitivity; hyperglycemia; metabolic syndrome; and diabetes mellitus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNPY expression is shown to be sensitive to energy status while NPY administration reduces energy expenditure, and another significant ability of NPY is to acutely stimulate feeding (S. Kalra, et al., Endocr. Rev., 1999, 20, 68-100). The NPY Y5 receptor has also been shown to be a receptor subtype responsible for NPY-induced food intake (C. Gerald, et al., Nature, 1996, 382, 168-171). Accordingly, it is predicted that the compounds of Formula I can be used for treating eating disorders such as bulimia; bulimia nervosa; binge eating disorder; and night eating disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnalgesic-like effects of NPY have been shown in rats and mice both after intrethecal administration and ICV administration, and after infusion directly into specific brain regions. These studies have used either “spinal” pain models or “supraspinal” models. The involvement of the Y5 receptor subtype has been linked to chronic pain disorders (Woldbye, et al. Brain Research, 2007, 49-55). Accordingly, it is expected that the compounds of Formula I can used for treating chronic pain disorders such as neuropathic pain; neuralgic pain; migraine; fibromyalgia; IBS; chronic fatigue syndrome; chronic tension type headache; chronic low back pain; myofascial pain and chronic osteoarthritis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, it is expected the treatment of the cognitive and mood impairment in Parkinson's disease may be an indication target for the compounds of Formula I. The compounds of Formula I may also be used to treat disorders relating to impulsivity and aggression.\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nOne objective of the present invention is to provide compounds which are ligands at the NPY Y5 receptor.

Such salts include pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Acid addition salts include salts of inorganic acids as well as organic acids.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRepresentative examples of suitable inorganic acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, phosphoric, sulfuric, sulfamic, nitric acids and the like. Representative examples of suitable organic acids include formic, acetic, trichloroacetic, trifluoroacetic, propionic, benzoic, cinnamic, citric, fumaric, glycolic, itaconic, lactic, methanesulfonic, maleic, malic, malonic, mandelic, oxalic, picric, pyruvic, salicylic, succinic, methane sulfonic, ethanesulfonic, tartaric, ascorbic, pamoic, bismethylene salicylic, ethanedisulfonic, gluconic, citraconic, aspartic, stearic, palmitic, EDTA, glycolic, p-aminobenzoic, glutamic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic acids, theophylline acetic acids, as well as the 8-halotheophyllines (for example, 8-bromotheophylline and the like).

Separation of such diastereomeric salts can be achieved, e.g. by fractional crystallization. The optically active acids suitable for this purpose may include, but are not limited to d- or l-tartaric, madelic or camphorsulfonic acids. Another method for resolving racemates into the optical antipodes is based upon chromatography on an optically active matrix. The compounds of the present invention may also be resolved by the formation and chromatographic separation of diastereomeric derivatives from chiral derivatizing reagents, such as, chiral alkylating or acylating reagents, followed by cleavage of the chiral auxiliary. Any of the above methods may be applied either to resolve the optical antipodes of the compounds of the invention per se or to resolve the optical antipodes of synthetic intermediates, which can then be converted by methods described herein into the optically resolved final products which are the compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdditional methods for the resolution of optical isomers, known to those skilled in the art, may be used. Such methods include those discussed by J. Jaques, A. Collet and S. Wilen in Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1981. Optically active compounds can also be prepared from optically active starting materials.\n\n\n \nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one of the specific compounds disclosed in the Experimental Section and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients, in either single or multiple doses.

It will be appreciated that the route will depend on the general condition and age of the subject to be treated, the nature of the condition to be treated and the active ingredient.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for oral administration include solid dosage forms such as capsules, tablets, dragees, pills, lozenges, powders and granules. Where appropriate, the compositions may be prepared with coatings such as enteric coatings or they may be formulated so as to provide controlled release of the active ingredient such as sustained or prolonged release according to methods well known in the art. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include solutions, emulsions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous and nonaqueous injectable solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders to be reconstituted in sterile injectable solutions or dispersions prior to use.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther suitable administration forms include, but are not limited to, suppositories, sprays, ointments, creams, gels, inhalants, dermal patches and implants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTypical oral dosages range from about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg body weight per day. Typical oral dosages also range from about 0.01 to about 50 mg/kg body weight per day. Typical oral dosages further range from about 0.05 to about 10 mg/kg body weight per day. Oral dosages are usually administered in one or more dosages, typically, one to three dosages per day. The exact dosage will depend upon the frequency and mode of administration, the sex, age, weight and general condition of the subject treated, the nature and severity of the condition treated and any concomitant diseases to be treated and other factors evident to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe formulations may also be presented in a unit dosage form by methods known to those skilled in the art. For illustrative purposes, a typical unit dosage form for oral administration may contain from about 0.01 to about 1000 mg, from about 0.05 to about 500 mg, or from about 0.5 to about 200 mg.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor parenteral routes such as intravenous, intrathecal, intramuscular and similar administration, typical doses are in the order of half the dose employed for oral administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention also provides a process for making a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In an embodiment of the present invention the compound utilized in the aforementioned process is one of the specific compounds disclosed in the Experimental Section.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of this invention are generally utilized as the free substance or as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. One example is an acid addition salt of a compound having the utility of a free base. When a compound of Formula I contains a free base such salts are prepared in a conventional manner by treating a solution or suspension of a free base of Formula I with a molar equivalent of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. Representative examples of suitable organic and inorganic acids are described above.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor parenteral administration, solutions of the compounds of Formula I in sterile aqueous solution, aqueous propylene glycol, aqueous vitamin E or sesame or peanut oil may be employed. Such aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. The aqueous solutions are particularly suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. The compounds of Formula I may be readily incorporated into known sterile aqueous media using standard techniques known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous solutions and various organic solvents. Examples of solid carriers include lactose, terra alba, sucrose, cyclodextrin, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and lower alkyl ethers of cellulose. Examples of liquid carriers include, but are not limited to, syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, phospholipids, fatty acids, fatty acid amines, polyoxyethylene and water. Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include any sustained release material known in the art, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, alone or mixed with a wax. The pharmaceutical compositions formed by combining the compounds of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are then readily administered in a variety of dosage forms suitable for the disclosed routes of administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form by methods known in the art of pharmacy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, and optionally a suitable excipient. Furthermore, the orally available formulations may be in the form of a powder or granules, a solution or suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIf a solid carrier is used for oral administration, the preparation may be tabletted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form or it may be in the form of a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier will vary widely but will range from about 25 mg to about 1 g per dosage unit. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule or sterile injectable liquid such as an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspension or solution.\n\n\n \nTreatment of Disorders\n\n\n \n \n \nAs mentioned above, the compounds of Formula I are ligands at the NPY Y5 receptor.

No. 6,124,331, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference, or in an assay as similarly described therein for NPY Y5 binding activity. The procedures for cell culture, transient transfection and membrane harvest, which are well known in the art, are described therein\n\n\n \nRadioligand Binding to Membrane Suspensions\n\n\n \n \n \nBriefly, membrane suspensions from transfected cells (typically expressed in LM(tk-) cells) and \n125\nI-PYY radioligand (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Mass.) were diluted in binding buffer supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin to yield an optimal membrane protein concentration so that \n125\nI-PYY bound by membranes in the assay was less than 10% of \n125\nI-PYY delivered to the sample (100,000 dpm/sample=0.08 nM for competition binding assays). Test compounds were diluted to desired concentrations with supplemented binding buffer in the presence of 30% DMSO. The binding assay was performed in 96-well polypropylene microtiter plates by mixing \n125\nI-PYY, test compound (25 μL), and finally, membrane suspensions (200 μL). Final DMSO=3%. Samples were incubated in at room temperature for about 120 min. Incubations were terminated by filtration over Whatman GF/C filters (pre-coated with 1% polyethyleneimine and air-dried before use), followed by washing with ice-cold binding buffer. Filter-trapped membranes were impregnated with MeltiLex solid scintillant (Wallac, Turku, Finland) and counted for \n125\nI-PYY in a Wallac MicroBeta Trilux. Non-specific binding was defined by 1000 nM porcine NPY. Specific binding was typically 80%; most non-specific binding was associated with the filter. Binding data were analyzed using nonlinear regression and statistical techniques available in the GraphPAD Prism package (San Diego, Calif.).\n\n\n \nRadioligand Binding Assay Results\n\n\n \n \n \nThe binding affinities for the compounds in the present invention, exemplified above, at the human NPY Y5 receptor were determined to be 10 μM or less. The binding affinities for most of the compounds were determined to be 1.0 μM or less. The binding affinities for several compounds were determined to be 100 nM or less.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE I\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nbinding affinity of selected compounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample No.\n\n\nKi (nM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1a\n\n\n220\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1e\n\n\n120\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2a\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2aj\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3a\n\n\n36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3i\n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3l\n\n\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3o\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3cc\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n3hh\n\n\n39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n4a\n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5a\n\n\n120\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5j\n\n\n2.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5m\n\n\n14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5q\n\n\n570\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFunctional Assay: NPY Y5-Dependent Inhibition of Forskolin-Stimulated Camp Accumulation\n\n\n \n \n \nStably transfected cells were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates and cultured until confluent. To reduce the potential for receptor desensitization, the serum component of the media was reduced to 1.5% for 4 to 16 hours before the assay. Cells were washed in Hank's buffered saline, or HBS (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM CaCl\n2\n, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, and 10 mM glucose) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin plus 100 uM IBMX. Test compounds were diluted to desired concentrations with assay buffer in the presence of 10% DMSO, then transferred to the cell plate and allowed to incubate for 20 min at 37° C. in 5% CO\n2 \n(final DMSO=1%). Cells were then stimulated with NPY (up to 10 uM) for a period of 5 min, followed by forskolin (10 uM) for another 5 min. The assay was then terminated and intracellular cAMP was quantified by with highthroughput time-resolved fluorometry (HTRF kit from CisBio, Bedford, Mass.). The effect of the test compound on agonist (NPY) activity were analyzed using nonlinear regression and statistical techniques available in the GraphPAD Prism package (San Diego, Calif.).\n\n\n \nFunctional Assay Results\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compounds of Examples 2a and 4a were determined to function as antagonists at the NPY Y5 receptor. The Compounds of the Invention were selected and tested in an assay as described above or similarly described herein for NPY5 binding and functional activity.\n\n\n \nExample 7\n\n\nIn-Vivo Assays\n\n\n \n \n \nThe in-vivo effects of the compounds of the present invention can be evaluated by using the following in-vivo behavioral animal models. The behavioral models described below are not intended to be the only models used to determine the efficacy of a compound of the invention to treat the corresponding disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAgonist-stimulated feeding assay. Sprague-Dawley rats (250-275 g) are implanted with guide cannulae into the lateral cerebral ventricle at Charles River Laboratories (Kingston, N.Y.) and shipped to the animal facility 2-3 days later. After a 1 week acclimation period, successful cannulae placement was confirmed by robust drinking in response to an i.c.v. infusion of angiotensin II (100 μg). At least 5 days prior to initiation of feeding studies, rats are acclimated to cages with wire grid floors, suspended by a stainless steel support above a waste tray. Food was removed on the morning of testing. To study the blockade of Y\n5 \nreceptor-induced feeding by the compound, animals were dosed orally with vehicle alone (20% cyclodextrin in distilled H\n2\nO) or the compound, followed 1 h later by i.c.v. infusion (5 μl over 1 min) of the Y\n5 \nreceptor-selective peptide agonist cPP (0.6 nmol in normal saline). The 0.6 nmol dose of cPP was selected because it is just below the ED\n50 \ndose (0.75 nmol) determined from preliminary experiments (data not shown) and provides a robust feeding signal. Animals are returned to the feeding cages and a pre-weighed amount of food was made available for 1 h. Net food intake=pre-weighed amount−(final amount+spilled amount). To test for nonspecific inhibition of the feeding response, we assess the effect of the compound (30 mg/kg) on feeding induced by 2 nmol NPY, a dose that evoked a feeding response equivalent to that of 0.6 nmol cPP.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRat Forced-swim Test: The procedure which may be used here is similar to that previously described (Luki, et al. Psychopharmacology 2001, 155, 315-322) with the following modifications. Male Sprague-Dawley rats may be used. Swim sessions are conducted for about 5 min, by placing rats in a plexiglass cylinder (about 46 cm tall×20 cm in diameter) filled about 30 cm deep with water at about 23° C. A compound of the invention or vehicle (about 0.01% lactic acid, about pH 6) is administered orally as a 1 ml/kg solution. Test sessions are videotaped and recorded for later scoring by a single rater, who is blinded to the treatment condition. Immobility is scored as the time a rat remained floating in the water making only movements necessary to keep its head above the water. Swimming is scored as the time a rat made active swimming motions, more than necessary to maintain its head above water.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRat Social-interaction Test: The procedure is performed for about 15 min as previously described (File and Hyde Br. J. Pharmacol. 1987, 62, 19-24) under low-light conditions using pairs of unfamiliar male Sprague-Dawley rats previously housed singly and exposed to the test arena for about 15 min on the previous day. A compound of the invention, chlordiazepoxide or vehicle is injected i.p. as a ˜1.0 ml/kg solution. All test sessions are videotaped and recorded for later scoring. Active social interaction, defined as sniffing, grooming, biting, boxing and crawling over and under, as well as locomotor activity (defined as squares crossed), is scored by a single rater, who is blinded to the treatment of each pair.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nChronic mild stress. The chronic mild stress (CMS) test is performed using male Wistar rats as described previously (Papp et al., 2002). Rats are first trained to consume a 1% sucrose solution in a series of baseline tests during which the sucrose solution was presented in the home cage for 1 h following 14 h food and water deprivation. On the basis of their final sucrose intake scores, animals are divided into two matched groups, one subjected continuously to chronic mild stress for a period of 8-9 consecutive weeks and the other housed separately as a non-stressed control group. Both groups are subjected to a sucrose consumption test once weekly, around 10:00 a.m. and under similar conditions as in the training period. Following 2-3 weeks of stress, sucrose intake scores are used to further divide both stressed and control animals into matched groups (n=8 per group). For the next 5 weeks both stressed and control animals receive twice daily intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (0.25% hydroxypropyl β methylcellulose, 1 ml/kg), a compound of the invention or citalopram at approx. 10:00 and 17:00, except that the 17:00 i.p. injection is omitted on days preceding the sucrose test. After 5 weeks the i.p. injections are terminated in both groups. Twenty-four h after the last i.p. injection, all animals are sacrificed and brains are removed."

Description\n\n\n\n\n HEPATITIS C VIRUS INHIBITORS CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial Number 61/122,487 filed December 15, 2008. The present disclosure is generally directed to antiviral compounds, and more specifically directed to compounds which inhibit the function of the NS3 protease (also referred to herein as \"serine protease\") encoded by Hepatitis C virus (HCV), compositions comprising such compounds, and methods for inhibiting the function of the NS3 protease. HCV is a major human pathogen, infecting an estimated 170 million persons worldwide - roughly five times the number infected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1. A substantial fraction of these HCV infected individuals develop serious progressive liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Presently, the most effective HCV therapy employs a combination of alpha- interferon and ribavirin, leading to sustained efficacy in 40% of patients. Recent clinical results demonstrate that pegylated alpha-interferon is superior to unmodified alpha-interferon as monotherapy. However, even with experimental therapeutic regimens involving combinations of pegylated alpha-interferon and ribavirin, a substantial fraction of patients do not have a sustained reduction in viral load. Thus, there is a clear and unmet need to develop effective therapeutics for treatment of HCV infection.\n\n\nHCV is a positive- stranded RNA virus. Based on a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence and the extensive similarity in the 5' untranslated region, HCV has been classified as a separate genus in the Flaviviridae family. All members of the Flaviviridae family have enveloped virions that contain a positive stranded RNA genome encoding all known virus-specific proteins via translation of a single, uninterrupted, open reading frame.\n\n\nConsiderable heterogeneity is found within the nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequence throughout the HCV genome. Six major genotypes have been characterized, and more than 50 subtypes have been described. The major genotypes of HCV differ in their distribution worldwide, and the clinical significance of the genetic heterogeneity of HCV remains elusive despite numerous studies of the possible effect of genotypes on pathogenesis and therapy.\n\n\n4- \n\n The single strand HCV RNA genome is approximately 9500 nucleotides in length and has a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a single large polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. In infected cells, this polyprotein is cleaved at multiple sites by cellular and viral proteases to produce the structural and non- structural (NS) proteins. In the case of HCV, the generation of mature non-structural proteins (NS 2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) is effected by two viral proteases. The first one cleaves at the NS2-NS3 junction; the second one is a serine protease contained within the JV~terminal region of NS3 and mediates all the subsequent cleavages downstream of NS3, both in cis, at the NS3-NS4A cleavage site, and in trans, for the remaining NS4A- NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, NS5A-NS5B sites. The NS4A protein appears to serve multiple functions, acting as a co-factor for the NS 3 protease and possibly assisting in the membrane localization of NS 3 and other viral replicase components. The complex formation of the NS 3 protein with NS4A is essential for efficient polyprotein processing, enhancing the proteolytic cleavage at all of the sites. The NS 3 protein also exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase and RNA helicase activities. NS5B is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is involved in the replication of HCV.\n\n\nThe present disclosure provides peptide compounds that can inhibit the functioning of the NS3 protease, e.g., in combination with the NS4A protease.

Cleavage occurs in the natural substrate between Pl and\n\n\nPI' where the nonprime positions designate amino acids starting from the C-terminus end of the peptide natural cleavage site extending towards the iV-terminus; whereas, the prime positions emanate from the iV-terminus end of the cleavage site designation \n\n and extend toward the C-terminus. For example, Pl ' refers to the first position away from the right hand end of the C-termlnus of the cleavage site (i.e. iV-terminus first position); whereas Pl starts the numbering from the left hand side of the C-terminus cleavage site, P2: second position from the C-terminus, etc.). (see Berger A. & Schechter L, Transactions of the Royal Society London series (1970), B257, 249-264].\n\n\nAsymmetric centers exist in the compounds of the present disclosure.

Dosage levels of between about 0.01 and about 150 milligram per kilogram (\"mg/kg\") body weight per day, preferably between about 0.05 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day of the compounds of the disclosure are typical in a monotherapy for the prevention and treatment of HCV mediated disease. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this disclosure will be administered from about 1 to about 5 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending on the condition being treated, the severity of the condition, the time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound employed, the duration of treatment, and the age, gender, weight, and condition of the patient. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient. Generally, treatment is initiated with small dosages substantially less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached, hi general, the compound is most desirably administered at a concentration level that will generally afford antivirally effective results without causing any harmful or deleterious side effects.\n\n\nWhen the compositions of this disclosure comprise a combination of a compound of the disclosure and one or more additional therapeutic and/or \n\n prophylactic agent, both the compound and the additional agent can be present in a dose that is less than or equal to the dosage normally administered in a monotherapy regimen. The compositions of this disclosure may be co-formulated with one or more additional therapeutic or prophylactic agents, for example, in the form of a monolithic and/or bi/multi-layer tablet or may be administered separately from the therapeutic or prophylactic agent(s).\n\n\nPharmaceutical formulations may be adapted for administration by any appropriate route, for example by the oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual, or transdermal), vaginal, or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional, intravenous, or intradermal injections or infusions) route. Such formulations may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for example by bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier(s) or excipient(s). Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules or tablets; powders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or whips; or oil-in- water liquid emulsions or water-in-oil emulsions.\n\n\nFor instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Powders are prepared by comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing with a similarly comminuted pharmaceutical carrier such as an edible carbohydrate, as, for example, starch or mannitol. Flavoring, preservative, dispersing, and coloring agent can also be present.\n\n\nCapsules are made by preparing a powder mixture, as described above, and filling formed gelatin sheaths. Glidants and lubricants such as colloidal silica, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium slearate, or solid polyethylene glycol can be added to the powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrating or solubilizing agent such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, or sodium carbonate can also be added to improve the availability of the medicament when the capsule is ingested. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. \n\n Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta- lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, betonite, xanthan gum, and the like. Tablets are formulated, for example, by preparing a powder mixture, granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and disintegrant, and pressing into tablets. A powder mixture is prepared by mixing the compound, suitable comminuted, with a diluent or base as described above, and optionally, with a binder such as carboxymethylcellulose, an aliginate, gelating, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a solution retardant such as paraffin, a resorption accelerator such as a quaternary salt and/or and absorption agent such as betonite, kaolin, or dicalcium phosphate. The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage, or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials and forcing through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powder mixture can be run through the tablet machine and the result is imperfectly formed slugs broken into granules. The granules can be lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc, or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. The compounds of the present disclosure can also be combined with a free flowing inert carrier and compressed into tablets directly without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A clear or opaque protective coating consisting of a sealing coat of shellac, a coating of sugar or polymeric material, and a polish coating of wax can be provided.

These purified recombinant proteins were generated for use in a homogeneous assay (see below) to provide an indication of how effective compounds of the present disclosure would be in inhibiting HCV NS3 proteolytic activity.\n\n\nSerum from an HCV-infected patient was obtained from Dr. T. Wright, San Francisco Hospital. An engineered full-length cDNA (compliment deoxyribonucleic acid) template of the HCV genome (BMS strain) was constructed from DNA fragments obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of serum RNA (ribonucleic acid) and using primers selected on the basis of homology between other genotype Ia strains. From the determination of the entire genome sequence, a \n\n genotype Ia was assigned to the HCV isolate according to the classification of Simmonds et al (See P Simmonds, KA Rose, S Graham, SW Chan, F McOmish, BC Dow, EA Follett, PL Yap and H Marsden, J Clin. Microbiol, 31(6), 1493-1503 (1993)). The amino acid sequence of the nonstructural region, NS2-5B, was shown to be >97% identical to HCV genotype Ia (H77) and 87% identical to genotype Ib (J4L6S). The infectious clones, H77 (Ia genotype) and J4L6S (Ib genotype) were obtained from R. Purcell (NIH) and the sequences are published in Genbank (AAB67036, see Yanagi,M., PurceIl,R.H., Emerson,S.U. and Bukh, J. Proc, Natl Acad, Set U.S.A. 94(16), 8738-8743 (1997); AF054247, see Yanagi,M.\n;\n St Claire,M., Shaρiro,M.\n?\n Emerson,S.U., Purcell,R.H. and Bukh, J., Virology 244 (1), 161-172. (1998)).\n\n\nThe H77 and J4L6S strains were used for production of recombinant NS3/4A protease complexes. DNA encoding the recombinant HCV NS3/4A protease complex (amino acids 1027 to 1711) for these strains was manipulated as described by P. Gallinari et al. (see Gallinari P, Paolini C, Brennan D, Nardi C, Steinkuhler C, De Francesco R. Biochemistry. 38(17):5620-32, (1999)). Briefly, a three-Iysine solubilizing tail was added at the 3 '-end of the NS4A coding region. The cysteine in the Pl position of the NS4A-NS4B cleavage site (amino acid 1711) was changed to a glycine to avoid the proteolytic cleavage of the lysine tag. Furthermore, a cysteine to serine mutation was introduced by PCR at amino acid position 1454 to prevent the autolytic cleavage in the NS 3 helicase domain. The variant DNA fragment was cloned in the pET21b bacterial expression vector (Novagen) and the NS3/4A complex was expressed in Escherichia, coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen) following the protocol described by P. Gallinari et al. (see Gallinari P\n5\n Brennan D, Nardi C, Brunetti M, Tomei L, Steinkuhler C, De Francesco R., J Virol 72(8):6758-\n\n\n69 (1998)) with modifications. Briefly, the NS3/4A protease complex expression was induced with 0.5 millimolar (mM) Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 22 hours (h) at 2O\n0\nC. A typical fermentation (1 Liter (L)) yielded approximately 10 grams (g) of wet cell paste. The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer ( 10 mL/g) consisting of 25 mM iV-(2-Hydroxyethyl)Piperazine-iV-(2-Ethane\n\n\nSulfonic acid) (HEPES), pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 500 mM Sodium Chloride (NaCl)\n5\n 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 microgram/milliliter (\"μg/mL\") lysozyme, 5 mM Magnesium \n\n Chloride (MgCl\n2\n), 1 μg/ml Dnasel, 5 mM β-Mercaptoethanol (βME), Protease inhibitor-Ethylenediamine Tetraacetic acid (EDTA) free (Roche), homogenized and incubated for 20 minutes (min) at 4\n0\nC. The homogenate was sonicated and clarified by ultra-centrifugation at 235000 g for 1 hour (h) at 4°C. Imidazole was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 15 mM and the pH adjusted to 8.0. The crude protein extract was loaded on a Nickel-NItrϊlotrϊacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column pre- equilibrated with buffer B (25 mM HEPES\n5\n pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 15 mM imidazole, 5 mM βME). The sample was loaded at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The column was washed with 15 column volumes of buffer C (same as buffer B except with 0,2% Triton X-100). The protein was eluted with 5 column volumes of buffer D (same as buffer C except with 200 mM Imidazole).\n\n\nNS3/4A protease complex-containing fractions were pooled and loaded on a desalting column Superdex-S200 pre-equilibrated with buffer D (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10 mM βME). Sample was loaded at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. NS3/4A protease complex-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to approximately 0.5 mg/ml. The purity of the NS3/4A protease complexes, derived from the BMS, H77 and J4L6S strains, were judged to be greater than 90% by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analyses. The enzyme was stored at -80 ° C, thawed on ice and diluted prior to use in assay buffer.\n\n\nFRET peptide assay to monitor HCV NS3/4Λ proteolytic activly The purpose of this in vitro assay was to measure the inhibition of HCV NS3 protease complexes, derived from the BMS strain, H77 strain or J4L6S strain, as described above, by compounds of the present disclosure. This assay provides an indication of how effective compounds of the present disclosure would be in inhibiting HCV NS3 proteolytic activity.\n\n\nIn order to monitor HCV NS3/4A protease activity, an NS3/4A peptide substrate was used. The substrate was RET Sl (Resonance Energy Transfer Depsipeptide Substrate; AnaSpec, Inc. cat # 2299I)(FRET peptide), described by Taliani et al. in Anal Biochem. 240(2):60-67 (1996). The sequence of this peptide is loosely based on the NS4A/NS4B natural cleavage site for the HCV NS3 protease except there is an ester linkage rather than an amide bond at the cleavage site. The \n\n peptide also contains a fluorescence donor, EDANS, near one end of the peptide and an acceptor, DABCYL, near the other end. The fluorescence of the peptide is quenched by intermolecular resonance energy transfer (RET) between the donor and the acceptor, but as the NS3 protease cleaves the peptide the products are released from RET quenching and the fluorescence of the donor becomes apparent.\n\n\nThe peptide substrate was incubated with one of the three recombinant NS3/4A protease complexes, in the absence or presence of a compound of the present disclosure. The inhibitory effects of a compound were determined by monitoring the formation of fluorescent reaction product in real time using a Cytofluor Series 4000. The reagents were as follow: HEPES and Glycerol (Ultrapure) were obtained from GIBCO-BRL. Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) was obtained from Sigma, β- Mercaptoethanol was obtained from Bio Rad.\n\n\nAssay buffer: 50 raM HEPES, pH 7.5; 0.15 M NaCl; 0.1% Triton; 15% Glycerol; 10 mM βME. Substrate: 2 μM final concentration (from a 2 mM stock solution in DMSO stored at -20\n0\nC). HCV NS3/4A protease type Ia (Ib), 2-3 nM final concentration (from a 5 μM stock solution in 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton-XIOO, 10 mM βME). For compounds with potencies approaching the assay limit, the assay was made more sensitive by adding 50 μg/ml Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma) to the assay buffer and reducing the end protease concentration to 300 pM.\n\n\nThe assay was performed in a 96-well polystyrene black plate from Falcon. Each well contained 25 μl NS3/4A protease complex in assay buffer, 50 μl of a compound of the present disclosure in 10% DMSO/assay buffer and 25 μl substrate in assay buffer. A control (no compound) was also prepared on the same assay plate. The enzyme complex was mixed with compound or control solution for 1 min before initiating the enzymatic reaction by the addition of substrate. The assay plate was read immediately using the Cytofluor Series 4000 (Perspective Biosystems). The instrument was set to read an emission of 340 nm and excitation of 490 nm at 25\n0\nC. Reactions were generally followed for approximately 15 min. The percent inhibition was calculated with the following equation:\n\n\n100-[(δTWδF\nCon\n)xl00] where δF is the change in fluorescence over the linear range of the curve. A non- \n\n linear curve fit was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (IC\n50\n) was calculated by the use of Excel XLfit software using the equation, y=A+((B~A)/(l+((C/x)\nΛ\nD))).\n\n\nCompounds of the present disclosure, which were tested against more than one type of NS3/4A complex, were found to have similar inhibitory properties though the compounds uniformly demonstrated greater potency against the Ib strains as compared to the Ia strains.\n\n\nSpecificity Assays The specificity assays were performed to demonstrate the in vitro selectivity of the compounds of the present disclosure in inhibiting HCV NS3/4A protease complex as compared to other serine or cysteine proteases.\n\n\nThe specificities of compounds of the present disclosure were determined against a variety of serine proteases: human neutrophil elastase (HNE), porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE) and human pancreatic chymotrypsin and one cysteine protease: human liver cathepsin B. In all cases a 96- well plate format protocol using a fluorometric Amino-Methyl-Coumarin (AMC) substrate specific for each enzyme was used as described previously (PCT Patent Application No. WO 00/09543) with some modifications to the serine protease assays. All enzymes were purchased from Sigma, EMDbiosciences while the substrates were from Bachem, Sigma and EMDbiosciences.\n\n\nCompound concentrations varied from 100 to 0.4 μM depending on their potency. The enzyme assays were each initiated by addition of substrate to enzyme- inhibitor pre-incubated for 10 min at room temperature and hydrolysis to 15% conversion as measured on cytofluor.\n\n\nThe final conditions for each assay were as follows:\n\n\n50 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-HCl) pH 8, 0.5 M Sodium Sulfate (Na\n2\nSO\n4\n), 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 3% DMSO, 0.01% Tween- 20 with 5 μM LLVY-AMC and 1 nM Chymotrypsin.\n\n\n50 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0. ImM EDTA\n5\n 3% DMSO, 0.02% Tween-20, 5 μM succ-AAPV-AMC and 20 nM HNE or 8 nM PPE; \n\n 100 mM NaOAC (Sodium Acetate) pH 5.5, 3% DMSO, 1 niM TCEP (Tris(2- carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride), 5 nM Cathepsϊn B (enzyme stock activated in buffer containing 20 mM TCEP before use), and 2 μM Z-FR-AMC diluted in H\n2\nO.\n\n\nThe percentage of inhibition was calculated using the formula:\n\n\n[1-((UVi\n1\nJ\n1\n-UVbUBA)Z(UVcU-UVbI^k))] x 100\n\n\nA non-linear curve fit was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (IC\n50\n) was calculated by the use of Excel XLfit software.\n\n\nGeneration of HC V Replicons\n\n\nAo HCV replicon whole cell system was established as described by Lohmann V, Korner F, Koch J, Herian U, Theilmann L, Bartenschlager R., Science 285(5424):1 10-3 (1999). This system enabled us to evaluate the effects of our HCV Protease compounds on HCV RNA replication. Briefly, using the HCV strain Ib sequence described in the Lohmann paper (Assession number:AJ238799), an HCV cDNA was synthesized by Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA), and the full- length replicon was then assembled in plasmid pGem9zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI) using standard molecular biology techniques. The replicon consists of (i) the HCV 5' UTR fused to the first 12 amino acids of the capsid protein, (ii) the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (neo), (iii) the IRES from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), and (iv) HCV NS3 to NS5B genes and the HCV 3' UTR. The replicon construct was modified by inserting cDNA encoding a humanized form of the Renilla luciferase gene and a linker sequence fused directly to the 3 '-end of the luciferase gene. This insert was introduced into the replicon construct using an Ascl restriction site located in core, directly upstream of the neomycin marker gene. The adaptive mutation at position 1179 (serine to isoleucine; later numbered S 22041) was also introduced (Blight KJ, Kolykhalov, AA\n5\n Rice, CM, Science 2000290(5498): 1972- 1974). Plasmid DNAs were linearized with Seal and RNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro using the T7 MegaScript transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to manufacturer's directions. In vitro transcripts of the cDNA were transfected into the human hepatoma cell line, HUH-7. Selection for cells \n\n constitutively expressing the HCV replicon was achieved in the presence of the selectable marker, neomycin (G418). Resulting cell lines were characterized for positive and negative strand RNA production and protein production over time.\n\n\nA stable HCV genotype Ia replicon cell line was generated with a similar genomic map as described above for the Ib replicon cell line. An additional adaptive substitution at position 1496 (proline to leucine) was also introduced (Lemm JA, Liu M\n5\n Rose RE, Fridell R, O'Boyle Ii DR, Colonno R, Gao M. Intervirology. 2005 48(2- 3): 183-91). The sequence of the H77 infectious clone (see above for details) was used to generate the sub-replicon which also contained the selectable marker G418 and the Renilla luciferase gene.\n\n\nHCV Replicon Luciferase Reporter Assay The HCV replicon luciferase assay was developed to monitor the inhibitory effects of compounds described in the disclosure on HCV viral replication.\n\n\nUtilization of a replicon luciferase reporter assay was first described by Krieger et al (Krieger N, Lohmann V, and Bartenschlager R, J Virol 75(10):4614-4624 (2001)). HUH-7 cells, constitutively expressing the HCV replicon, were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Media (DMEM) (Gibco-BRL) containing 10% Fetal calf serum (FCS) (Sigma) and 1 mg/ml G418 (Gibco-BRL). ). Compounds were serially diluted 3-fold in DMSO for a twenty-point titration and subsequently transferred to sterile 384-well tissue-culture treated plates (Corning cat # 3571), Cells (50 μL in DMEM containing 4% FCS) were then seeded in these plates at a density of 3.0 x 10\n3\n cells/well (0.5% final DMSO concentration). After 3 days incubation at 37\n0\nC\n5\n cells were analyzed for Renilla Luciferase activity using the EnduRen as substrate\n\n\n(Promega cat #E6485). The EnduRen substrate was diluted in DMEM and then added to the plates to a final concentration of 7.5 μM. The plates were incubated for 2 hrs at 37\n0\nC and then read immediately for 30 seconds on the Viewlux Imager (PerkinElmer) using a luminescence program. To assess cytotoxicity of compounds, CC so values were generated by multiplexing the EnduRen-containing plates with Cell\n\n\nTiter-Blue (Promega, cat # G8082). Cell-Titer Blue (3 μL) was added to each well and incubated for 8 hrs at 37°C. The fluorescence signal from each well was read,\n\n\nAl \n\n with an excitation wavelength at 525/10 nm and an emission wavelength of 598/10 nm, on the Viewlux Imager.\n\n\nThe percentage inhibition was calculated using the formula below: % control = average luciferase signal in experimental wells (+ compound) average luciferase signal in DMSO control wells (- compound)\n\n\nThe values were graphed and analyzed using XLfit to obtain the EC\n50\n value.\n\n\nThe compounds of the current disclosure was tested and found to have the activity as follows:\n\n\nIC50 (τM) la / lb EC50 (nM)\n\n\nCompound 1 2 49 / 21\n\n\nCompound 2 4 95 / 33\n\n\nIt will be evident to one skilled in the art that the present disclosure is not limited to the foregoing illustrative examples, and that it can be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the essential attributes thereof. It is therefore desired that the examples be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, reference being made to the appended claims, rather than to the foregoing examples, and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein."
