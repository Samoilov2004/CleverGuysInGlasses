Accordingly the United States Government may have certain rights to this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThroughout this application, various publications are referenced by author name and date in parentheses. Full citations for these publications may be found at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art as known to those skilled therein as of the date of the invention described and claimed herein.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nAlterations of serotonin (5-HT) transmission have been implicated in a wide variety of psychiatric conditions, such as mood and anxiety disorders. The 5-HT transporter (SERT) is a critical protein for the regulation of 5-HT function and is the target of most commonly used antidepressants. Because of their localization on the 5-HT nerve terminals, the density of these sites is a marker for the number or integrity of the 5-HT terminals. Therefore, in vivo imaging of SERT with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or Single Photon Emission Computerized Tomography (SPECT) provides a unique tool to study 5-HT function in health and disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral postmortem studies have documented the distribution of SERT cells in the human brain (Cortes et al., 1988; Laruelle et al., 1988a; Backstrom et al., 1989; Plenge et al., 1990; Rosel et al., 1997). High SERT density is observed at the level of the midbrain nuclei, reflecting the presence of SERT on both the 5-HT cell body (raphe nuclei) and on terminals of the dense 5-HT innervation of the adjacent structures (substantia nigra, nucleus interpeduncularis, locus coeruleus, nucleus nervi hypoglossi, nucleus nervi facialis). High SERT density is also observed in the thalamus (especially in the superior and inferior colliculi and the midline nuclei, with lower density in the anterior nuclei of the thalamus), the hypothalamus and the striatum. Intermediate levels are found in the limbic and paralimbic structures, including the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala and cingulate cortex. In humans, lower levels of SERT are observed in the neocortex, and very low to negligible levels have been reported in the cerebellum.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe development of radioligands for in vivo imaging of SERT has been difficult. A large number of radioligands such as [\n11\nC]cyanoimipramine, [\n11\nC]sertraline, [\n11\nC]dapoxetine, [\n11\nC]fluoxetine, [\n11\nC]citalopram, cis-[\n11\nC]DDPI, [\n11\nC]LY257327, [\n11\nC]venlafaxine, [\n11\nC]nor-beta-CIT, [\n123\nI]5-iodo-6-nitroquipazine and [\n76\nBr]5-bromo-6-nitroquipazine have been evaluated as potential PET or SPECT radioligands and found to be unsuitable due to high lipophilicity, and/or high nonspecific binding (Hashimoto et al., 1987; Lasne et al., 1989; Dannals et al., 1990; Hume et al., 1991; Nelson et al., 1991; Livni et al., 1994; Scheffel et al., 1994; Jagust et al., 1996; Bergstrom et al., 1997; Smith et al., 1997; Zea-Ponce et al., 1997; Lundkvist et al., 1999).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe SPECT radioligand [\n123\nI]β-CIT, which exhibits similar affinity for dopamine transporters (DAT) and SERT (Neumeyer et al., 1991), was the first radioligand successfully used to image SERT in the living human brain. [\n123\nI]β-CIT labels predominantly DAT in the striatum and SERT in the midbrain (Laruelle et al., 1993b). This regional selectivity stems from the abundance of DAT relative to SERT in the striatum, and of SERT relative to DAT in the midbrain. Thus, the midbrain uptake of [\n123\nI]β-CIT has been studied in several pathological conditions (Tiihonen et al., 1997; Heinz et al., 1998; Malison et al., 1998; Jacobsen et al., 2000; Laruelle et al., 2000b; Willeit et al., 2000). While these studies yielded interesting findings regarding associations between low SERT midbrain density and depression, alcoholism, and impulsivity, they are limited by the fact that \n[123\nI]β-CIT enables the measurement of SERT binding only in the midbrain region.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[\n11\nC]McN 5652 was the first PET radioligand successfully developed and used to image SERT density in humans (Suchiro et al., 1993b; Suchiro et al., 1993a; Szabo et al., 1995b; Szabo et al., 1995a; Szabo et al., 1999; Buck et al., 2000; Parsey et al., 2000). For example, [\n11\nC]\nMcN\n 5652 has been used to study 5-HT innervation in MDMA (“ecstasy”) abusers (McCann et al., 1998). However, [\n11\nC]\nMcN\n 5652 as a PET radioligand is associated with the following limitations (Parsey et al., 2000): 1) the brain uptake is protracted, requiring at least 120 minutes of data acquisition in humans to yield time-independent measures of SERT binding potential (BP) in regions with high SERT density, such as the midbrain; 2) the nonspecific binding is relatively high, thus precluding the reliable quantification of SERT in regions of relatively lower density such as the limbic system; and 3) the plasma free fraction is too low to be measured with accuracy using the conventional ultracentrifugation method, thus making it impossible to control for this variable in clinical studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore recently, a new series of SPECT SERT radioligands from the diarylsulfide class of compounds has been introduced and evaluated by Kung and colleges which include [\n123\nI]IDAM (Acton et al., 1999a; Kung et al., 1999; Oya et al., 1999) and [\n123\nI]ADAM (Choi et al., 2000; Oya et al., 2000; Acton et al., 2001). The C-11 labeled counterpart of [\n123\nI]ADAM, [\n11\nC]ADAM, has recently been reported, (Vercouillie et al., 2001). [\n123\nI]ADAM has been shown to be suitable for imaging both the midbrain and cortex in baboons (Oya et al. 2000). However, the slow binding kinetics of this radioligand in vivo precludes its usefulness as a Positron Emissions Tomography (PET) radioligand. A number of compounds in this same class were developed by Wilson et al. as potential PET radioligands (Wilson et al., 1999, 2000). Among these, [\n11\nC]DASB has been evaluated in rats and humans (Wilson et al., 2000, Houle et al., 2000; Ginovart et al., 2001; Meyer et al., 2001). DASB demonstrated an adequate signal-to-noise ratio and in vivo kinetics for a PET radioligand. It is uncertain whether [\n11\nC]DASB can be used to detect SERT in the cortex. Halogenated naphthyl methoxy piperidine has also been used as a radioligand for mapping SERT by PET (Goodman, U.S. Pat. No. 5,919,797). Other diarylsulfide classes of compounds have been described for use as pharmaceuticals (Polivka et al., PCT Patent No. WO 97/17325 and Mehta et al., European Patent No. 0 402 097).\n\n\n \nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention provides a compound having the structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nor a physiologically acceptable salt thereof;\n\n\nwherein R\n1 \nis H, X, CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\nO—, X(CH\n2\n)\nn\nO—, CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\nS—, X(CH\n2\n)\nn\nS—, CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\nOCH\n2\n—, X(CH\n2\n)\nn\nOCH\n2\n—, CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\n(O)—, X(CH\n2\n)\nn\n(O)—, CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\n(O)O—, X(CH\n2\n)\nn\n(O)O—, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n2\nX, where n=0, 1, 2, or 3;\n\n\nwherein R\n2 \nis H, X, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n2\nX, where n=0, 1, 2, or 3;\n\n\nwherein R\n3 \nis H, X, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n2\nX, where n=0, 1, 2, or 3;\n\n\nwherein R\n4 \nis H, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n2\nX, where n=0, 1, 2, or 3;\n\n\nwherein only one of R\n1\n, R\n2\n, and R\n3 \nis H;\n\n\nwherein X=halogen;\n\n\nwherein if n=0 then (CH\n2\n)\nn \nis absent;\n\n\nwherein any halogen in the compound may be a radioisotope.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention also provides a compound having the structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nor a physiologically acceptable salt thereof;\n\n\nwherein R\n1 \nis X, CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\nO—, X(CH\n2\n)\nn\nO—, CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\nS—, X(CH\n2\n)\nn\nS—, CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\nOCH\n2\n—, X(CH\n2\n)\nn\nOCH\n2\n—, CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\n(O)—, X(CH\n2\n)\nn\n(O)—, CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\n(O)O—, X(CH\n2\n)\nn\n(O)O—, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n2\nX, where n=0, 1, 2, or 3;\n\n\nwherein R\n2 \nis X, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n2\nX, where n=0, 1, 2, or 3;\n\n\nwherein R\n3 \nis H, X, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n2\nX, where n=0, 1, 2, or 3;\n\n\nwherein R\n4 \nis H, or (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n, where n=0, 1, 2, or 3;\n\n\nwherein X=halogen;\n\n\nwherein if n=0 then (CH\n2\n)\nn \nis absent;\n\n\nwherein a carbon atom in R\n4 \nmay be [\n11\nC];

[\n11\nC]McN 5652, [\n11\nC]ADAM, [\n11\nC]DAPA and [\n11\nC]AFM thalamus to cerebellum ratios increase continuously during the time-frame of the experiments. In contrast, [\n11\nC]DASB reaches a state of transient equilibrium at about 50 minutes (thalamic and cerebellar activities decrease at a similar relative rate). The circles identify the times and levels at which the measured thalamus to cerebellum ratio is equal to the true equilibrium ratio (equal to V\n3\n″+1). These values were: [\n11\nC]McN 5652: 70 minutes, 1.78; [\n11\nC]ADAM: 55 minutes, 1.92; [\n11\nC]DASB: 32 minutes, 2.68; [\n11\nC]DAPA: 80 minutes, 2.49; [\n11\nC]AFM: 64 minutes, 3.10. These times provide an estimate of the point at which peak of specific binding occurs.

This prediction was generally confirmed, with the exception that greater than expected V\n3\n″ values were observed in the striatum for [\n11\nC]McN 5652 and in the striatum, hippocampus and neocortical regions for [\n11\nC]ADAM.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nFIG. 14\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAffinity (K\ni \nfor SERT at room temperature) and lipophilicity (logP) of the four new compounds (ADAM, DASB, DAPA and AFM) evaluated in this study as candidate PET radioligands to label SERT in vivo. This figure illustrates that ADAM and DAPA are relatively similar, that the lower lipophilicity of DASB is associated with relatively lower affinity, and that AFM provides both a lower lipophilicity and a higher affinity. The predictions based on these data were generally confirmed in this study. [\n11\nC]DASB and [\n11\nC]AFM were the only compounds with measurable f\n1 \nand f\n2 \nfractions in vivo. [\n11\nC]DASB, combining low affinity and low lipophilicity, displayed a fast kinetic of uptake and wash-out, and shorter scanning time required to derive distribution volumes. [\n11\nC]AFM, displaying high affinity and low lipophilicity, provided the best specific to nonspecific contrasts.

Most are selective re-uptake inhibitor of serotonin and bind with high affinity to the serotonin transporter. Thus, when they are labeled with positron-emitting carbon-11 or fluorine-18, these compounds can be used to detect the concentration of serotonin transporter in the living brain using the novel imaging technique known as Positron Emission Tomography (PET).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention in particular relates to the preparation of imaging agents that can be used in imaging applications and investigation of serotonin transporter in psychiatric diseases such as depression, anxiety disorders and substance abuse.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis research tool can be used to non-invasively study the alterations in SERT density and 5-HT function in many neuropsychiatric disorders, and help in the development of new drugs for treatment of these disorders. Molecular imaging of the biological markers in diseases will help advance the understanding of origin and mechanism of neuropsychiatric disorders, and generate definitive and quantifiable biological parameters for disease diagnosis and treatment process monitoring. In the future, when sufficient databases have been established linking biological markers with neuropsychiatric disorders, molecular imaging using Positron Emissions Tomography (PET) and labeled AFM and related radioligands might provide a non-invasive and objective means for the diagnosis and evaluation of neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe second application of SERT imaging using PET is the study of dose-receptor occupancy relation of therapeutic agents such as the current class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that include fluxetine) (Prozac®) and paroxetine (Paxil®). Such an application might also aid in the development of new therapeutic agents by helping define a safe and efficacious therapeutic dose of new agent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention covers the preparation and application of unlabeled and labeled 2-{2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]phenylthio}-5-fluoromethylphenylamine (AFM) and related compounds, which are new chemical entities (NCEs). 2-{2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]phenylthio}-5-fluoromethylphenylamine and related compounds can be labeled with either \n11\nC or \n18\nF. Combined with Positron Emission Tomography (PET), labeled 2-{2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]phenylthio}-5-fluoromethylphenylamine and related radioligands enables in vivo visualization and quantification of serotonin (5HT) transporters (SERT) in the brain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe current classes of SERT radioligands use a (\n11\nC)radiolabel and \n11\nC has a half-life of 20.4 minutes. Therefore, \n11\nC radiolabeled compounds can only be used in PET Centers with an on-site cyclotron. In the United States, 90% of PET Centers do not have an on-site cyclotron. Our invention allows for [\n18\nF] labeling. The fluorine-18 (\n18\nF) radiolabel has a significantly longer half-life (109.8 minutes) and could be distributed to PET centers through a distribution network that already exists to deliver radioactive compounds across North America. Consequently \n18\nF labeled imaging compounds would have widespread and feasible application.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis invention provides a compound having the structure:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nor a physiologically acceptable salt thereof;\n\n\nwherein R\n1 \nis H, X, CH\n3 \n(CH\n2\n)\nn\nO—, X(CH\n2\n)\nn\nO—, CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\nS—, X(CH\n2\n)\nn\nS—, CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\nOCH\n2\n—, X(CH\n2\n)\nn\nOCH\n2\n—, CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\n(O)—, X(CH\n2\n)\nn\n(O)—, CH\n3\n(CH\n2\n)\nn\n(O)O—, X(CH\n2\n)\nn\n(O)O—, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n2\nX, where n=0, 1, 2, or 3;\n\n\nwherein R\n2 \nis H, X, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n2\nX, where n=0, 1, 2, or 3;\n\n\nwherein R\n3 \nis H, X, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n2\nX, where n=0, 1, 2, or 3;\n\n\nwherein R\n4 \nis H, (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n3\n, or (CH\n2\n)\nn\nCH\n2\nX, where n=0, 1, 2, or 3;\n\n\nwherein only one of R\n1\n, R\n2\n, and R\n3 \nis H;\n\n\nwherein X=halogen;\n\n\nwherein if n=0 then (CH\n2\n)\nn \nis absent;\n\n\nwherein a carbon atom in R\n4 \nmay be [\n11\nC]; and\n\n\nwherein any halogen in the compound may be a radioisotope.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one specific embodiment of the compound one carbon in R\n4 \nis [\n11\nC].

Faster uptake kinetics will enable time-independent derivation of SERT parameters in shorter scanning sessions and a higher target to background ratio would improve the reliability in the quantification of SERT availability in regions of relatively low SERT density, but of great significance in psychiatric conditions, such as the limbic system. In addition, a new radioligand that can be labeled with the longer-lived radioisotope fluorine-18 is also advantageous in that it enables the wide distribution and application of the ligand.\n\n\n \nI.

Routinely, the carbon-11 target (pressurized with 1% O\n2 \nin N\n2 \nto 200 psi) is irradiated with a beam current of 40 μA for 60 minutes to yield about 1300 mCi of [\n11\nC] CO\n2\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnhydrous [\n18\nF]fluoride is prepared from aqueous [\n18\nF]NaF produced via the (p, n) nuclear reaction of [\n18\nO]H\n2\nO in a RDS-112 cyclotron.

Method for Biodistribution Studies in Rats\n\n\n \n \n \nAppropriately labeled compounds were studied in animals to assess their binding characteristics in the brain. Procedures for these biodistribution studies are as follows. The labeled compound in saline was injected into groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (3 rats for each group) via the tail vein and the rats were sacrificed by decapitation, following anesthesia with CO\n2\n, at desired time points (for example 10, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after radioactivity injection). The brain regions (cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum, frontal cortex, thalamus and hypothalamus), along with samples of blood and part of the tail, were removed, weighed, and counted in a Packard Cobra II gamma counter. The percent injected dose (% ID) of the decay- and tail-corrected activity in the brain regions and blood were calculated based upon C-11 standards prepared from the injection solution, and the % ID/g were calculated using the tissue weights.\n\n\n \nB. Results\n\n\n \n \n \nResults from biodistribution studies in rats are presented in Table 2. From Table 2 it can be seen that all labeled compounds demonstrated desired properties of an appropriate radioligand for labeling SERT in vivo: 1) the radioligand enters the animal brain easily, with ID %/g in general exceeding 0.5% at 10 minute post-injection; 2) over time, the radioactivity accumulates in SERT-rich brain regions such as thalamus and hypothalamus and generates a good region of interest over cerebellem activity ratio, an indication of specific binding; 3) radioactivity reaches a high point, then decreases from there over time, indicating appropriate clearance.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiodistribution of radioligands in male Sprague-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDawley rats % ID/g.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFrontal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(min)\n\n\nBlood\n\n\nCerebellum\n\n\nCtx.\n\n\nStriatum\n\n\nHippocamp.\n\n\nHypothal.\n\n\nThalamus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n11\nC]MADAM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.61 ± 0.15\n\n\n1.04 ± 0.33\n\n\n2.17 ± 0.78\n\n\n1.57 ± 0.54\n\n\n1.39 ± 0.29\n\n\n1.93 ± 0.72\n\n\n1.95 ± 0.61\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n0.26 ± 0.07\n\n\n0.55 ± 0.04\n\n\n1.78 ± 0.23\n\n\n1.41 ± 0.21\n\n\n1.14 ± 0.17\n\n\n1.48 ± 0.22\n\n\n1.66 ± 0.17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n0.15 ± 0.04\n\n\n0.27 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.89 ± 0.07\n\n\n0.81 ± 0.15\n\n\n0.84 ± 0.27\n\n\n1.39 ± 0.28\n\n\n1.14 ± 0.18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n11\nC]AFA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.26 ± 0.10\n\n\n0.35 ± 0.12\n\n\n0.70 ± 0.25\n\n\n0.54 ± 0.18\n\n\n0.48 ± 0.17\n\n\n0.55 ± 0.18\n\n\n0.60 ± 0.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n0.08 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.14 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.49 ± 0.06\n\n\n0.38 ± 0.14\n\n\n0.34 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.47 ± 0.06\n\n\n0.44 ± 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n0.06 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.09 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.29 ± 0.05\n\n\n0.26 ± 0.04\n\n\n0.24 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.42 ± 0.06\n\n\n0.39 ± 0.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n11\nC]AFM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.37 ± 0.28\n\n\n0.40 ± 0.06\n\n\n0.99 ± 0.25\n\n\n0.72 ± 0.17\n\n\n0.59 ± 0.14\n\n\n0.75 ± 0.19\n\n\n0.79 ± 0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n0.28 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.41 ± 0.11\n\n\n1.31 ± 0.28\n\n\n1.12 ± 0.21\n\n\n0.95 ± 0.29\n\n\n1.37 ± 0.48\n\n\n1.18 ± 0.30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n0.19 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.21 ± 0.04\n\n\n1.37 ± 0.10\n\n\n1.02 ± 0.15\n\n\n0.84 ± 0.10\n\n\n1.27 ± 0.16\n\n\n1.29 ± 0.22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n11\nC]AFE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.15 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.31 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.61 ± 0.07\n\n\n0.58 ± 0.08\n\n\n0.44 ± 0.04\n\n\n0.61 ± 0.11\n\n\n0.63 ± 0.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n0.07 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.12 ± 0.00\n\n\n0.39 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.35 ± 0.05\n\n\n0.31 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.44 ± 0.04\n\n\n0.44 ± 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n0.05 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.05 ± 0.00\n\n\n0.19 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.19 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.18 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.29 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.22 ± 0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n18\nF]AFA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.27 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.38 ± 0.09\n\n\n0.81 ± 0.26\n\n\n0.65 ± 0.18\n\n\n0.54 ± 0.17\n\n\n0.73 ± 0.26\n\n\n0.72 ± 0.24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n0.16 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.20 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.65 ± 0.08\n\n\n0.58 ± 0.05\n\n\n0.48 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.66 ± 0.05\n\n\n0.69 ± 0.03\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n0.09 ± 0.00\n\n\n0.07 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.28 ± 0.05\n\n\n0.26 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.23 ± 0.04\n\n\n0.38 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.34 ± 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n90\n\n\n0.08 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.05 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.20 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.19 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.18 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.30 ± 0.06\n\n\n0.23 ± 0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n120 \n\n\n0.07 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.04 ± 0.00\n\n\n0.11 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.11 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.10 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.17 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.16 ± 0.02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n18\nF]AFM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.37 ± 0.04\n\n\n0.33 ± 0.04\n\n\n0.82 ± 0.14\n\n\n0.69 ± 0.15\n\n\n0.51 ± 0.07\n\n\n0.70 ± 0.08\n\n\n0.72 ± 0.13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n0.28 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.23 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.99 ± 0.20\n\n\n0.83 ± 0.12\n\n\n0.64 ± 0.12\n\n\n0.82 ± 0.16\n\n\n0.88 ± 0.06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n0.10 ± 0.04\n\n\n0.13 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.71 ± 0.18\n\n\n0.57 ± 0.12\n\n\n0.45 ± 0.09\n\n\n0.71 ± 0.14\n\n\n0.67 ± 0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n90\n\n\n0.08 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.08 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.52 ± 0.19\n\n\n0.45 ± 0.17\n\n\n0.36 ± 0.12\n\n\n0.58 ± 0.13\n\n\n0.50 ± 0.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n120 \n\n\n0.04 ± 0.00\n\n\n0.07 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.38 ± 0.09\n\n\n0.42 ± 0.10\n\n\n0.28 ± 0.05\n\n\n0.55 ± 0.08\n\n\n0.56 ± 0.10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n18\nF]AFE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n0.25 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.28 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.62 ± 0.08\n\n\n0.51 ± 0.05\n\n\n0.38 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.51 ± 0.05\n\n\n0.58 ± 0.08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n0.13 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.13 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.32 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.33 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.27 ± 0.04\n\n\n0.41 ± 0.03\n\n\n0.39 ± 0.01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n0.07 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.06 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.19 ± 0.04\n\n\n0.21 ± 0.05\n\n\n0.17 ± 0.04\n\n\n0.24 ± 0.04\n\n\n0.27 ± 0.04\n\n\n\n\n\n\n90\n\n\n0.04 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.03 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.08 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.10 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.09 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.14 ± 0.02\n\n\n0.17 ± 0.02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n120 \n\n\n0.02 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.02 ± 0.00\n\n\n0.06 ± 0.00\n\n\n0.08 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.07 ± 0.00\n\n\n0.10 ± 0.01\n\n\n0.13 ± 0.02\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(mean ± SD, n = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo further determine the in vivo binding specificity of the radioligands to the SERT, blocking studies were carried out. Specifically, groups of rats were pre-treated with the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor citalopram, the selective norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor nisoxetine, or the selective dopamine re-uptake inhibitor GBR 12935 (2 mg/kg each, i.v.). Radioactivity was injected 10 minutes after drug treatment, and rats were sacrificed 45 to 60 minutes after radioactivity administration. Brain parts were dissected and radioactivity levels (ID %/g) in brain regions calculated as above. For all the test compounds, pre-treatment with citalopram reduced radioactivity levels in the striatum, frontal cortex, thalamus and hypothalamus, regions with high densities of SERT, by 50 to 80%, while radioactivity level in the cerebellum, a region with negligible amount of SERT, remained little changed. Furthermore, pretreatment with either nisoxetine or GBR 12935 did not change radioactivity levels in the brain significantly. These data indicated that binding of these radiolabeled compounds in the rat brain is specific to the SERT, further demonstrating their usefulness as radioligands for the in vivo labeling of SERT.\n\n\n \n \nExperiment\n 3\n\n\nCharacteristics of \n11\nC Labeled PET Radioligands for Imaging SERT In Vivo in the Baboon Brain\n\n\n \n \n \nImaging studies in baboons have been carried out to characterize selected C-11 labeled PET radioligands and compare their in vitro and in vivo pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties. Radioligands included in these studies are [\n11\nC]McN 5652, [\n11\nC]ADAM, [\n11\nC]DASB, [\n11\nC]DAPA and [\n11\nC]AFM. Details of the studies are described below.\n\n\n \nAbbreviations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\nMcN 5652: (+)-6β-(4-methylthiophenyl)-1,2,3,5,6α,10β-hexahydropyrrolo[2,1-a]isoquinoline\n\n\nADAM: 2-{2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]phenylthio}-5-iodophenylamine\n\n\nDASB: 3-amino-4-{2[(dimethylamino)methyl]phenylthio}benzonitrile\n\n\nDAPA: 5-bromo-2-{2[(dimethylamino)methyl]phenylthio}phenylamine\n\n\nAFM: 2-{2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]phenylthio}-5-fluoromethylphenylamine\n\n\n\n\nA. Materials and Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nChemistry: The standard and radiolabeling precursors of ADAM and DASB were synthesized at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Toronto, respectively (Oya et al., 2000) (Wilson et al., 2000). The standard and radiolabeling precursors of \nMcN\n 5652, DAPA and AFM were synthesized at Columbia University (Huang et al., 1998; Huang et al., 2001a; Huang et al., 2001b). Radiolabeling procedures were performed as previously described (Parsey et al., 2000; Wilson et al., 2000; Huang et al., 2001a; Huang et al., 2001b; Vercouillie et al., 2001). For the preparation of [\n11\nC]ADAM, [\n11\nC]DASB, [\n11\nC]DAPA and [\n11\n]AFM, the following procedure was used: radiolabeling precursor (0.3-0.5 mg) was dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF, 0.4 mL) in a 1.0 mL reaction vial. [\n11\nC]Methyl iodide, produced according to the literature procedure, was bubbled through the precursor solution. When maximum radioactivity was reached in the reaction vial, the bubbling and vent needles were removed and the reaction solution heated in a water bath (85-90° C.) for 5 minutes. The crude product was then purified using a semi-preparative HPLC system (HPLC column: Phenomenex Prodigy C180DS-Prep, 10μ, 10×250 mm; Eluent: mixture of MeCN and 0.1 M ammonium formate, pH 6.5, with composition depending on the particular tracer; Flow rate: 8-10 mL/minute). The product fraction was collected, diluted with water (100 mL) and passed through a Waters classic C18 Sep-Pak. After washing with water (10 mL), the Sep-Pak was eluted with EtOH (1 mL) to recover the radiolabeled product. The EtOH solution was then mixed with sterile normal saline (9 mL), filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane filter and the filtered solution collected in a sterile vial. The radiolabeled products (25-100 mCi) were obtained in >95% chemical and radiochemical purity. The structures of the unlabeled compounds listed above can be found in \nFIG. 1\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vitro binding assays: Measurement of the inhibition constants (K\ni\n) of the labeled compounds in \nFIG. 1\n on rat frontal cortex homogenates were performed at Columbia University using [\n3\nH]paroxetine, as previously described (Laruelle et al., 1988b). Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were killed by decapitation. Dissection of the brain was carried out on ice and samples of the frontal cortex were stored at −40° C. until binding assay. After thawing, samples were homogenized in 10 volumes of buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mM NaCl and 5 mM KCl). The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. Pellets were resuspended in 10 volumes of buffer, incubated at 37° C. for 10 minutes, and centrifuged again. This procedure was then repeated a third time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the binding assay, membranes were suspended in buffer at a final protein concentration of 5 mg/mL. Unlabelled drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in borosilicate glass tubes to yield a 1 mM stock solution, from which subsequent serial dilutions were performed with the buffer. Aliquots of tissue preparation were incubated with [\n3\nH]paroxetine (0.1 nM) at 22° C. or 37° C. for 60 minutes in the absence or presence of unlabelled drug (10\n−5 \nto 10\n−12 \nM) to yield a final volume of 0.5 mL (borosilicate glass tubes). Nonspecific binding was defined by incubation with 10 μM of citalopram. Each concentration was performed in triplicates. After incubation, the mixture was rapidly filtered through Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters using a 48-channel cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, Md.). The filters were washed 3 times with 4 mL each of ice cold buffer, placed in vials with 4 mL Ultima Gold solvent (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, Ill.), and counted the following day for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter (Tricarb 1500, Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, Ill.). This experiment was performed three times at 22° C. and 37° C., on three different days. K\ni \nvalues were derived using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, Calif.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn vitro logP measurement: Octanol/water partition coefficient of the radiolabeled compounds were measured at Columbia University, using the method of Wilson et al. (2001), with some modifications. Briefly, 300 to 500 μCi of radioligand in EtOH was added to a separatory funnel containing octanol (20 mL) and phosphate buffer (20 mL, pH 7.4). The mixture was shaken mechanically for 3 minutes and the layers were separated. The octanol layer (15 mL) was transferred to a second separatory funnel containing 15 mL of the phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The mixture was shaken mechanically for 3 minutes and the layers were separated. This second octanol layer was then partitioned into four test tubes (2 mL each) and the phosphate buffer (2 mL each) added. The test tubes were vortexed for 10 minutes, and then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1000 rpm to separate the layers. The octanol and aqueous phases (1.0 mL each) were transferred into counting tubes and counted with a gamma counter (Wallac 1480 Wizard 3M Automatic Gamma Counter, Perkin-Elmer, Boston, Mass.). The radioactivity counts were decay-corrected and the partition coefficient calculated as P=counts in octanol/counts in buffer. Eight separate measurements were preformed for each tracer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPET imaging protocol: PET experiments (n=20) were performed at Columbia University. Two adult male baboons (baboon A and B) were studied twice with each of the 5 radioligands (4 experiments per radioligand). All experiments took place within a 9-month period. Baboons A and B were 31 kg and 21 kg in weight at the beginning of the experimental period and 28 and 22 kg at the end, respectively. Test and retest experiments with the same radioligand were obtained on different days, with an average interval of 117±53 days.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExperiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Fasted animals were immobilized with ketamine (10 mg/kg i.m.), and anesthetized with 1.8% isoflurane via an endotracheal tube. Vital signs were monitored every 10 minutes and the temperature was kept constant at 37° C. with heated water blankets. An i.v. perfusion line was used for hydration and injection of radioligands and nonradioactive drugs. A catheter was inserted in a femoral artery for arterial blood sampling. Head was positioned at the center of the field of view as defined by imbedded laser lines. PET imaging was performed with the ECAT EXACT HR+PET scanner (Siemens/CTI, Knoxville, Tenn.). In 3D mode, this camera provides an in-plane resolution of 4.3 mm, 4.5 mm, 5.4 mm and 8.0 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) at a distance of 0, 1, 10 and 20 cm from the center of the field of view, respectively (Brix et al., 1997). A 15 minute transmission scan was obtained prior to radioligand injection for attenuation correction. Activity was injected i.v. over 30 seconds. The injected mass and radioactivity had an upper limit of 6 μg and 6 mCi, respectively. Emission data was collected in the 3D mode for 91 minutes as 21 successive frames of increasing duration (6*10 seconds, 2*1 minutes, 4*2 minutes, 2*5 minutes, and 7*10 minutes).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInput function measurements: Arterial samples were collected every 5 seconds with an automated system for the first two minutes and manually thereafter at various intervals. A total of 28 samples were collected. Following centrifugation (10 minutes at 1,800 g), plasma was collected and activity measured in 200 μl aliquots on a gamma counter (Wallace 1480 Wizard 3M Automatic Gamma Counter, Perkin-Elmer, Boston, Mass.).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelected plasma samples (n=6 per study, collected at 2, 4, 12, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after radioligand administration) were further processed by extraction with methanol (MeOH) followed by HPLC analysis to measure the fraction of plasma activity representing unmetabolized parent compound. The parent fraction was measured as follows: plasma (0.5 mL) was pipetted into a centrifuge tube containing MeOH (1.0 mL). The content in the tube was mixed and centrifuged (3.5 minutes at 15,000 rpm). The liquid phase was separated from the precipitate. Activity in 0.1 mL of the liquid phase was counted and the rest was injected onto the HPLC. The HPLC eluate was fraction-collected in 6 counting tubes (4.0 mL each). The HPLC system consisted of a Waters 510 isocratic pump, a Rheodyne injector equipped with a 2 mL sample loop, a C18 analytical column (Phenomenex ODS-prep, 10 μm, 4.6×250 mm), a Bioscan Flow Cell gamma detector (Bioscan, Washington, D.C.), and a fraction collector. The column was eluted with a mixture of acetonitrile and aqueous 0.1 M ammonium formate (proportion depending on the tracer being analyzed) at a flow rate of 2 mL/minute. Before plasma sample analysis, the retention time of the parent tracer was established by injection of a few μCi of the tracer and detection of the peak using the Bioscan gamma detector.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe parent fraction was calculated as the ratio of activity in the fractions containing the parent to that of the total activity collected. A biexponential function was fitted to the six measured parent fractions, and used to interpolate values between and after the measurements. The smallest exponential of the fraction parent curve, λ\npar\n, was constrained to the difference between λ\ncer\n, the terminal rate of washout of cerebellar activity, and λ\ntot\n, the smallest elimination rate constant of the total plasma (Abi-Dargham et al., 1999) (Abi-Dargham et al., 1999). The input function was then calculated as the product of total counts and interpolated fraction parent at each time point. The measured input function values were fitted to a sum of three exponentials, and the fitted values were used as input for the kinetic analyses. The clearance of the parent compound (C\nL\n, L/hour) was calculated as the ratio of the injected dose to the area under the curve of the input function (Rowland and Tozer, 1989; Abi-Dargham et al., 1994). The initial distribution volume (V\nbol\n, L) was calculated as the ratio of injected dose to peak plasma concentration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor the determination of the plasma free fraction (f\n1\n), \ntriplicate\n 200 μL aliquots of plasma, separated from blood collected prior to tracer injection and spiked with the radioligand, were pipetted into ultrafiltration units (Amicon Centrifree, Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) and centrifuged at room temperature (20 minutes at 4000 rpm) (Gandelman et al., 1994). Plasma and ultrafiltrate activities were counted, and f\n1 \nwas calculated as the ratio of ultrafiltrate activity to total plasma activity. Triplicate aliquots of the radioligand in pH 7.4 Tris buffer were also processed to determine the filter retention of free tracer.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImage analysis: A Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) of each baboon's brain was obtained for the purpose of identifying the regions of interest (ROI) (T1-weighted axial MRI sequence, acquired parallel to the anterior-posterior commissure, TR 34 msec, TE 5 msec, flip angle of 45 degrees, slice thickness is 1.5 mm, zero gap, matrix 1.5 mm×1 mm×1 mm voxels). The following regions were drawn on the MR images: cerebellum, midbrain, thalamus, striatum, hippocampus, temporal cortex, cingulate cortex and occipital cortex.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPET emission data were attenuation-corrected using the transmission scan, and frames were reconstructed using a Shepp filter (cutoff 0.5 cycles/projection rays). Reconstructed image files were then processed using the image analysis software MEDx (Sensor Systems, Inc., Sterling, Va.). An image was created by summing all the frames, and this summed image was used to define the registration parameters with the MR image, using between-modality automated image registration (AIR) algorithm (Woods et al., 1993). Registration parameters were then applied to the individual frames for registration to the MR data set. Regional boundaries were transferred to the individual registered PET frames, and time-activity curves were measured and decay-corrected. Right and left regions were averaged. For a given animal, the same regions were used for all radioligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBrain uptake: Total brain uptake was expressed as percentage of the injected dose per gram of tissue (% ID g\n−1\n) in a region encompassing the entire brain. Regional peak time was defined as the mid-time of the frame associated with the highest activity value. To estimate the degree of wash-out from the brain captured during the scan interval (91 minutes), the decrease in activity from the peak frame to the last frame was calculated and expressed in percentage of the peak activity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinetic analysis: Regional total distribution volumes (V\nT\n, mL g\n−1\n) were derived with kinetic analysis of the regional time-activity curves, using the arterial plasma concentrations as input function. For each tracer, the use of a two-tissue compartment model was associated with an unacceptable number of non-convergences or convergences with negative rate constants and with large error in the estimates of V\nT \n(data not shown). In contrast, a one-tissue compartment model converged in all cases and generally provided good fit to the data. Therefore, the one-tissue compartment model was selected for this investigation. In the one-tissue compartment model, V\nT \nis derived as the K\n1\n/k\n2 \nratio, where K\n1 \n(mL g\n−1 \nmin\n−1\n) and k\n2 \n(min\n−1\n) are the unidirectional fractional rate constant for the transfer of the tracer in and out of the brain, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinetic parameters were derived by nonlinear regression using a Levenberg-Marquart least squares minimization procedure implemented in MATLAB (The Math Works, Inc., South Natick, Mass.) as previously described (Laruelle et al., 1994c). Given the unequal sampling over time (increasing frame acquisition time from the beginning to the end of the study), the least squares minimization procedure was weighted by the square root of the frame acquisition time. The contribution of plasma total activity to the regional activity was calculated assuming a 5% blood volume in the ROI and subtracted from the regional activity prior to analysis (Mintun et al., 1984). No correction was applied for the delay between the arrival of activity in the femoral artery and the brain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe minimal scanning time required to achieve time-independent derivation of regional V\nT \nwas evaluated by fitting the time-activity curves to shorter data sets, representing total scanning time of 81, 71, 61, 51, and 41 min, respectively. The resulting estimates of V\nT \nwere normalized to the V\nT \nderived with the 91 minute data set. For each region and each tracer (n=4 observations per scan duration), the average and standard deviation of the normalized V\nT \nwere calculated. Time independence was considered achieved when two criteria were fulfilled: 1) the average normalized V\nT \nhad is between 95% and 105% of the reference V\nT \n(small bias), and 2) the SD of the normalized V\nT \nis less than 10% (small error).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDerivation of SERT parameters: Because of the low to negligible levels of SERT in the cerebellum, cerebellar V\nT \nwas used as an estimate of the nonspecific distribution volume (including free and nonspecific binding) in the ROIs. Therefore, BP (mL g\n−1\n) was derived as the difference between V\nT \nin the ROI (V\nT \nROI) and V\nT \nin the cerebellum (V\nT \nCER). Under these conditions, BP is equal to (Laruelle et al., 1994b):\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBP\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nTROI\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nTCER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nf\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB\n\n\nmax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere B\nmax \nis the regional concentration of SERT (nM per g of tissue), and K\nD \nis the in vivo affinity of the tracer for SERT (nM per mL of brain water).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor between tracer comparisons, the main outcome measure of interest was the specific to nonspecific equilibrium partition coefficient (V\n3\n″). V\n3\n″ was calculated as the ratio of BP to V\nT CER\n.

After the initial distribution phase, [\n11\nC]AFM and [\n11\nC]ADAM total plasma activities increased, indicating that the distribution volumes of these two compounds were larger than those of their metabolites.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMetabolism: Tracers were metabolized into more polar compounds at a moderate rate. Plasma parent fraction as percentage of the total plasma activity measured at 2, 4, 12, 30, 60 and 90 min was analyzed with repeated measure ANOVA, with time as repeated measure and baboons and tracers as cofactors (\nFIGS. 3A\n and \n3\nB). Statistically significant differences in rate of metabolism were noted between tracers (p=0.01), but not between animals (p=0.32). Post-hoc analysis revealed that [\n11\nC]AFM had a significantly faster metabolism compared to [\n11\nC]ADAM, [\n11\nC]DASB and [\n11\nC]DAPA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInput function: Table 5 lists the initial distribution volumes (V\nbol\n) and clearances of the parent compounds. Regarding V\nbol\n, no between animal differences (p=0.74), but significant between tracer differences were observed (p=0.003). [\n11\nC]AFM had significantly higher V\nbol \nthan [\n11\n]DASB, and both [\n11\nC]AFM and [\n11\n]DASB V\nbol \nwere significantly higher than [\n11\nC]McN 5652, [\n11\nC]ADAM and [\n11\nC]DAPA V\nbol\n. Regarding the clearance of the parent compounds, significant differences were observed between baboons (p=0.003), and differences between radioligands were observed at trend level (p=0.08). Combining all tracers, baboon A showed faster clearance (85±30 L h\n−1\n, n=10) than baboon B (56±14 L h\n−1\n, p=0.008). The clearance of [\n11\nC]AFM was faster than the clearance of [\n11\nC]McN 5652 (p=0.03), [\n11\nC]DAPA (p=0.03) and [\n11\nC]ADAM (p=0.09), and similar to the clearance of [\n11\nC]DASB (p=0.66).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma free fraction: Table 5 lists the percent activity remaining on the filters following ultracentrifugation of the radioligands dissolved in saline, as well as the plasma free fraction (f\n1\n). Because of previously demonstrated high retention of [\n11\nC]McN 5652 on the filter (Parsey et al., 2000), [\n11\nC]McN 5652 f\n1 \nwas not measured. This problem was also encountered with [\n11\nC]ADAM and [\n11\nC]DAPA where more than 75% of the activity remained on the filter following ultracentrifugation of these tracers dissolved in saline. In contrast, [\n11\nC]DASB and [\n11\nC]AFM showed moderated (<20%) filter retention when dissolved in saline. Thus, the measured f\n1 \napproximates the in vivo f\n1 \nonly for these two tracers. [\n11\nC]DASB f1 was significantly higher than [\n11\nC]AFM f1(p=0.023).\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasma analysis of parent compound: Vbol, clearance,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nretention on filter, and plasma free fraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nVbol\n\n\nClearance\n\n\nFilter\n\n\nf1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadiotracer\n\n\n(L)\n\n\n(L h\n−1\n)\n\n\nretention (%)\n\n\n(%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n11\nC] McN\n\n\n5.9 ± 1.8\n\n\n58 ± 13\n\n\n—\n\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5652\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n11\nC] ADAM\n\n\n8.1 ± 3.1\n\n\n67 ± 13\n\n\n88.2 ± 5.2%\n\n\n0.9 ± 0.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n11\nC] DASB\n\n\n12.6 ± 2.2 \n\n\n84 ± 23\n\n\n19.2 ± 4.7%\n\n\n13.5 ± 1.7% \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n11\nC] DAPA\n\n\n8.5 ± 1.8\n\n\n58 ± 22\n\n\n77.9 ± 6.6%\n\n\n1.8 ± 0.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[\n11\nC] AFM\n\n\n17.6 ± 1.3 \n\n\n90 ± 46\n\n\n19.3 ± 4.1%\n\n\n9.6 ± 0.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nValues are mean ± SD of four experiments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBrain Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \nTotal Brain uptake: All tracers showed excellent brain penetration, with total brain uptake higher than 0.01% ID g\n−1 \nat 45 minutes. Statistically significant differences in total brain uptake was noted between baboons (p=0.047) and ligands (p=0.015). Baboon A (the animal with the faster clearance) showed lower brain uptake (0.015±0.003% ID g\n−1\n) than baboon B (0.017±0.001% ID g\n−1\n) [\n11\nC]DASB showed significantly lower total brain uptake at 45 min (0.013±0.002% ID g\n−1\n) compared to [\n11\nC]McN 5652 (0.016±0.002% ID g\n−1\n, p=0.017), [\n11\nC]ADAM (0.017±0.001% ID g\n−1\n, p=0.011), [\n11\nC]DAPA (0.018±0.002% ID g\n−1\n, p=0.001), and [\n11\nC]AFM (0.016±0.002% ID g\n−1\n, p=0.027).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nActivity distribution: Over time, activity concentrated in brain regions with high SERT densities, i.e. midbrain, thalamus, and striatum. Intermediate levels were found in the hippocampus, temporal and cingulate cortices, and lower values were found in other cortical regions. Lowest values were observed in the cerebellum (\nFIG. 4\n). With all tracers, activity accumulation was readily noticeable in the central structures associated with high SERT densities (midbrain, thalamus and striatum). However, the higher density of SERT in medial temporal lobe structures such as hippocampus compared to the neocortex translated into a visually detectable activity contrast only in the [\n11\nC]DASB and [\n11\nC]AFM images.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIGS. 5-9\n present time-activity curves for each ligand in plasma (corrected for metabolites) and in brain, where a subset of representative regions (thalamus, striatum, temporal cortex and cerebellum) are presented. To facilitate comparison between ligands, experiments that are presented were acquired in the same animal (baboon A), activities were normalized to the injected doses, and the axis scales were kept constant. It can be appreciated that [\n11\nC]McN 5652 (\nFIG. 5B\n) and [\n11\nC]ADAM (\nFIG. 6B\n) displayed a similar pattern of brain kinetics: the uptake was relatively slow and protracted (peak uptake is smooth), the wash-out was slow, and only modest differences were observed between the regions. In contrast, [\n11\nC]DASB (\nFIG. 7B\n) presented an initial rapid uptake, an early and sharp peak, a rapid wash-out, and larger differences between regions. [\n11\nC]DAPA kinetic profile (\nFIG. 8B\n) was similar to [\n11\nC]McN 5652 and [\n11\nC]ADAM, in that the uptake showed a smooth and protracted peak, but differed from these two tracers in that the differences in activity between regions were larger. [\n11\nC]AFM (\nFIG. 9B\n) shared with [\n11\nC]DASB a sharp peak and faster wash-out, but the peak occurred later and the differences in activity between regions were more accentuated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegional uptake: Regional peak uptake times are presented in Table 6. Variability in regional peak uptake times was evaluated with repeated measure ANOVA, with regions as repeated measure and baboons and ligands as cofactors. Significant differences in peak uptake were observed between regions (p<0.0001), between tracers (p=0.008) and, at trend level, between baboons (p=0.07). Regional rank order for peak uptake time was cerebellum<occipital cortex≈cingulate cortex<temporal cortex<striatum≈hippocampus<thalamus≈midbrain. Rank order of mean regional peak uptake time for radioligands was [\n11\nC]DASB (19±9 minutes)<[\n11\nC]McN 5652 (28±12 minutes)<[\n11\nC]ADAM (37±18 minutes)≈[\n11\nC]AFM (38±19 minutes)<[\n11\nC]DAPA (50±20 minutes). Post-hoc analysis revealed that [\n11\n]DASB peaked significantly earlier than [\n11\nC]ADAM, [\n11\nC]AFM, and [\n11\nC]DAPA (p<0.05).

As f\n2 \nand K\nD \nwere not expected to vary between regions, regional variability in V\n3\n″ should reflect regional variability in B\nmax\n. Under the hypothesis that each tracer binds to the same population of binding sites (i.e. SERT), the relative regional distribution of V\n3\n″ should be similar for each tracer. This prediction was tested by expressing, for each experiment, regional V\n3\n″ in percentage of thalamus V\n3\n″. Combining all tracers and all baboons, midbrain V\n3\n″ was equal to 92±8% of thalamic V\n3\n″. Striatal V\n3\n″ values were 52±7% of thalamic V\n3\n″ and hippocampal V\n3\n″ was 34±6%. In the neocortical regions, these values were 23±9%, 18±8% and 12±7% for temporal, cingulate and occipital cortices, respectively. Variability between relative regional V\n3\n″ was assessed with repeated measure ANOVA, with regions as repeated measure and ligand as covariate. Significant differences were observed between regions (p<0.001), but not between tracers (p=0.20), and a significant tracer by region interaction was observed (p=0.002). The interaction plot is presented in \nFIG. 13\n. To identify the source of this interaction, all regions were analyzed separately. No between-ligand difference in relative V\n3\n″ were observed in the midbrain (p=0.67), hippocampus (p=0.15), temporal cortex (p=0.18) and occipital cortex (p=0.75). In the striatum, [\n11\nC]McN 5652 and [\n11\nC]ADAM displayed a significantly larger relative V\n3\n″ value compared to [\n11\nC]DASB, [\n11\nC]DAPA, and [\n11\nC]AFM. In the cingulate, [\n11\nC]ADAM displayed significantly larger relative V\n3\n″ value compared to the four other tracers. In fact, this relative excess of [\n11\nC]ADAM V\n3\n″ was also observed in the temporal and cingulate cortex, although these differences did not reach significance in these regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReproducibility of regional SERT V\n3\n″ measurement: The test/retest reproducibility, calculated as the absolute value of the difference between \ntest\n 1 and \ntest\n 2 divided by their average value is presented in Table 13. Significant differences in reproducibility were observed between regions (p=0.04), and, at trend level, between ligands (p=0.062). Reproducibility was relatively uniform across regions, with the exception of the occipital cortex, which showed significantly worse reproducibility of V\n3\n″ measurement compared to all other regions. The rank order of reproducibility for ligands was, from the best to the worst, [\n11\nC]AFM≈[\n11\nC]DAPA>[\n11\nC]DASB>[\n11\nC]McN 5652>[\n11\nC]ADAM.

Discussion\n\n\n \n \n \nIn this study, the imaging qualities of four new PET radioligands for the SERT, [\n11\nC]ADAM, [\n11\nC] DASB, [\n11\nC]DAPA and [\n11\nC]ADAM, were compared in baboons to the current reference tracer, [\n11\nC]McN 5652. The results indicate that both [\n11\nC]DASB and [\n11\nC]AFM provide substantial improvement over [\n11\nC]McN 5652 for SERT imaging.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe introduction of [\n11\nC]McN 5652 in the mid-nineties represented an important advance, as this radioligand was the first imaging agent successfully used to image SERT in baboons (Szabo et al., 1995a) and humans (Szabo et al., 1995b) in vivo with PET. The significance of this achievement must be appreciated in the context of years of failed attempts to develop a suitable radioligand for SERT (see introduction). Prior to [\n11\nC]McN 5652, only [\n123\nI]β-CIT was available for in vivo visualization of SERT in the human brain, and the use of this ligand for SERT imaging was restricted to the midbrain region (Laruelle et al., 1993b). [\n11\nC]McN 5652, being more selective than [\n123\nI]β-CIT, was suitable to image SERT, not only in the midbrain, but also in the thalamus and striatum. The modest selectivity of [\n11\nC]McN 5652 relative to norepinephrine transporters (Shank et al., 1988) did not appear to create a significant problem in vivo, at least in mice, where 5 mg/kg desipramine failed to affect specific binding (Suchiro et al., 1993b).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHowever, [\n11\nC]McN 5652 provides a relatively low signal to noise ratio, thus precluding the reliable quantification of SERT in regions of the limbic system, where the concentrations of SERT is lower than those in the midbrain, striatum and thalamus. In addition, the uptake of [\n11\nC]McN 5652 was relatively protracted in human. As a result, at least 120 minutes of data acquisition was required to obtain time-independent estimates of V\nT \nin regions of high SERT density, such as the midbrain. And finally, the free fraction of [\n11\nC]McN 5652 in plasma is too low to be measured accurately using the standard ultracentrifugation technique. Thus, while [\n11\nC]McN 5652 was suitable to image SERT in humans, the limitations of this ligand were also recognized (Szabo et al., 1999; Buck et al., 2000; Parsey et al., 2000).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn 1999, Kung and colleagues reported the synthesis and characterization of a new radioiodinated compound, [\n123\nI]IDAM (K\nD \nfor SERT of 0.25 nM), based on a new class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Acton et al., 1999a; Kung et al., 1999; Oya et al., 1999). [\n123\nI]IDAM was the first selective radioligand to image SERT with SPECT. In the same year, this group also reported [\n123\nI]ODAM, a phenoxy derivative of [\n123\nI]IDAM, that was more resistant to metabolism but had a slightly lower affinity for SERT, and lower midbrain to cerebellum ratio (Acton et al., 1999b; Zhuang et al., 2000). In 2000, Kung and colleagues reported on a third ligand, [\n123\nI]ADAM, an amino derivative of [\n123\nI]IDAM (Choi et al., 2000; Oya et al., 2000; Acton et al., 2001). In vitro K\ni \nof [\n125\nI]ADAM in rat brain membranes (0.15 nM) was comparable to [\n125\nI]IDAM (0.25 nM). However, [\n123\nI]ADAM displayed four times higher target to background ratio in vivo compared to [\n123\nI]IDAM, thus making it a radioligand of choice to image SERT with SPECT. In 2001, Vercouille et al. (2001) reported the labeling of ADAM with C-11. However, the properties of [\n11\nC]ADAM as a PET imaging agent have not yet been reported.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt about the same time, Wilson and colleagues synthesized and evaluated a number of compounds in this same series as C-11 labeled candidate PET radioligands (Wilson et al., 1999; and Wilson et al., 2000). Among these [\n11\nC]DASB (K\nD\n=1.10 nM) emerged as the most promising agent, based on the fast wash-out kinetic in rats. Further, two of these new compounds, [\n11\nC]DASP and [\n11\nC]DAPP, were evaluated in humans (Houle et al., 2000). In humans, [\n11\nC]DASB displayed higher brain uptake than [\n11\nC]DAPP. Additional characterization of [\n11\nC]DASB in humans revealed that its binding was inhibited following pretreatment with paroxetine and citalopram (Houle et al., 2000). Kinetic analysis of [\n11\nC]DASB uptake in humans demonstrated that a one-tissue compartment model was appropriate to derive [\n11\nC]DASB distribution volumes (Ginovart et al., 2001).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSeveral other derivatives in this phenylamine series of compounds have been prepared and characterized (Huang et al. 2001a; Huang et al. 2001b). [\n11\nC]DAPA, the bromo analog of ADAM, showed promising features in rodent studies (Huang et al., 2001b). Two fluorinated analogues were also prepared and evaluated, [\n11\nC]AFA and [\n11\nC]AFM, both suitable for potential labeling with F-18 (Huang et al., 2001a). [\n11\nC]AFM displayed superior in vivo binding properties in rodents and baboons compared to [\n11\nC]AFA, and was selected for further development.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nConsequently, over the last three years, the portfolio of available SERT imaging agents was dramatically changed. Whereas, until recently, only one selective tracer was available, there are now several highly selective and promising candidate PET radioligands. Due to differences in methodologies between laboratories and the limited nature of outcome measures used in the initial evaluation of tracers (tissue to cerebellum ratio at one time-point), it was difficult to compare the potential of these new radioligands based on published literature. Therefore, this study was designed as a collaborative effort to evaluate the imaging qualities of these tracers under identical experimental conditions. This evaluation included in vitro measurement of affinity and lipophilicity, and in vivo PET imaging experiments in two baboons.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor each parameter, a desired property was a priori defined to provide improvement over [\n11\nC]McN 5652. Among these, the most critical elements included: 1) higher V\n3\n″, to provide better signal to noise contrast for the quantification of SERT in regions of relatively low SERT density, such as regions of the limbic system; 2) reduced scanning time required to derive time-independent estimate of VT, to improve subject compliance and reduce noise associated with C-11 decay; 3) increased plasma free fraction, to be able to control for this parameter in clinical studies. Note that \n \nproperties\n \n 1 and 2 are essentially conflicting: everything else being equal, a higher in vivo affinity will result in higher V\n3\n″ values but in longer time required to reach equilibrium.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 14 summarizes the rank order of the tested compounds for each parameter.

The McN 5652 C\n50 \nfor 5-HT uptake blockade (0.4 nM, Shank et al., 1988)) was also consistent with K\ni \nvalues measured here. The comparative evaluation performed here indicated that DASB had significantly lower affinity for SERT than the other four compounds, and that this difference was magnified as temperature increases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe test compounds showed significant differences in lipophilicity, with [\n11\nC]DASB and [\n11\nC]AFM showing lower lipophilicity than [\n11\nC]DASB and [\n11\nC]DAPA, with [\n11\nC]McN 5652 occupying an intermediate position. It is usually assumed that higher lipophilicity will translate into higher nonspecific binding to plasma proteins and brain membranes (low f\n1 \nand f\n2\n, respectively). This prediction was verified in part here: [\n11\nC]DASB and [\n11\nC]AFM were less lipophilic than [\n11\nC]ADAM and [\n11\nC]DAPA, and as a result showed higher f\n1 \ncompared to [\n11\nC]ADAM and [\n11\nC]DAPA. The lipophilicity of [\n11\nC]McN 5652 was not significantly different from that of [\n11\nC]AFM, and significantly but only slightly higher than that of [\n11\nC]DASB. However, [\n11\nC]McN 5652 free fraction was not measurable using the conventional ultracentrifugation technique. These observations confirmed that the predictive value of relative lipophilicity measurement for in vivo properties is restricted to compounds belonging to the same chemical structure class.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIntegrating affinity and lipophilicity information for the four new compounds, and keeping in mind that low lipophilicity and high affinity are desirable, it appears that AFM provides the best combination of both parameters (\nFIG. 14\n). Compared to ADAM and DAPA, the lower lipophilicity of DASB is achieved at the price of a lower affinity. In contrast, the lower lipophilicity of AFM is achieved without a decreased affinity.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPlasma Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGiven that [\n11\nC]McN 5652 is associated with high but protracted brain uptake, desired properties of new tracers included a faster rate of metabolism and plasma clearance. Everything else being equal, faster clearance from the plasma should result in decreased scanning time. This rule was actually verified by serendipity in this study: baboon A displayed a faster clearance than baboon B (presumably due to its greater weight), but identical SERT availability. Between-baboon differences predictable by this situation were confirmed: compared to baboon B, baboon A displayed lower total brain uptake at 45 minutes, earlier peak time, faster brain wash-out, and higher ROI to cerebellum ratios at 90 minutes. The difference between ROI to cerebellum ratios at 90 minutes between baboon A and B is a good illustration of the dependence of these ratios to the plasma clearance, and of the danger associated with the use of tissue ratios as outcome measure to estimate target site availability (see discussion in Carson et al., 1993). For between-tracer differences, [\n11\nC]AFM exhibited a faster metabolism rate, and both [\n11\nC]AFM and [\n11\nC]DASB exhibited faster plasma clearance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe plasma free fraction of [\n11\nC]McN 5652 is not measurable by the conventional ultracentrifugation method, due to high binding to the ultracentrifugation filters (Parsey et al., 2000). The same situation was encountered with [\n11\nC]ADAM and [\n11\nC]DAPA. In contrast, filter binding was modest for [\n11\nC]AFM and [\n11\nC]DASB. [\n11\nC]DASB f\n1 \nmeasured in this study in baboons was similar (13.5±1.7%, n=4) to [\n11\nC]DASB f\n1 \nreported previously in humans (11.0±1.2%, n=5) (Ginovart et al., 2001). [\n11\nC]AFM f\n1 \nwas of comparable magnitude (9.6+0.5%). Both values were lower than the plasma free fraction of [\n123\nI]β-CIT (40±5%) (Laruelle et al., 1994a). The ability to measure free fraction in the plasma is critical for clinical studies involving conditions in which this fraction might change, such as alcoholism (Abi-Dargham et al., 1998). Short of f\n1 \nmeasurement, the significance of differences in brain distribution volumes will be difficult to interpret.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn conclusion, the faster plasma clearance and measurable free fractions of [\n11\nC]DASB and [\n11\nC]AFM are two factors that favor these two ligands over [\n11\nC]McN 5652, [\n11\nC] ADAM and [\n11\nC]DAPA.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nImage Analysis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSimple inspection of images (\nFIG. 4\n) and time-activity curves (\nFIGS. 5-9\n) reveals major features that differentiate these ligands from one another.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nFIG. 5B\n illustrates the limitations of [\n11\nC]McN 5652: the brain uptake was protracted, the regional peak activities were poorly defined, and the differences between cerebellum and ROI activities were modest. The PET images showed a specific accumulation in midbrain and thalamus, while the striatum barely emerges from the neocortical activity, and the hippocampus is not detectable. [11C]ADAM time-activity profile (\nFIG. 6B\n) and images were similar to [\n11\nC]McN 5652 (with the exception of a relatively higher uptake in the temporal cortex). The uptake of [\n11\nC]DASB (\nFIG. 7B\n) was very different from [\n11\nC]McN 5652, in that it showed a fast uptake, well-defined peaks, and appreciable wash-out. On the [\n11\nC]DASB images, the cerebellum was darker, the contrast was better, and the hippocampus was detectable. [\n11\nC]DAPA presented a time-activity profile similar to [\n11\nC]McN 5652 and [\n11\nC]ADAM, with the exception that the differences between regions appeared to be more pronounced (\nFIG. 8B\n). The PET images of [\n11\nC]DAPA were also similar in term of contrasts to the [α]McN 5652 and [\n11\nC]ADAM images. Finally, [\n11\nC]AFM shared with [\n11\nC]DASB a well defined peak, and appreciable wash-out (\nFIG. 9B\n). On the images, [\n11\nC]AFM provided a superior contrast, the concentration of activity in midbrain and thalamus was very high, and the striatum and most remarkably the hippocampus clearly emerged from the neocortical background. The quantitative analysis confirmed the impression gained by simple examination of the time-activity curves. Compared to [\n11\nC]McN 5652, [\n11\nC]ADAM and [\n11\nC]DAPA, [\n11\nC] DASB exhibited earlier peaks, faster wash-out, and higher ratios at the end of the experiments. [\n11\nC]AFM shared with [\n11\nC]DASB the higher ratios, but peak activities occurred later than those of [\n11\nC]DASB, and less wash-out was observed during the time-frame of the scans.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUptake Kinetics\n\n\n \n \n \n \nKinetic analysis was performed using a one-tissue compartment model. The better performance of the one-versus the two-tissue compartment model has been previously noted for [\n11\nC]-\nMcN\n 5652 by several groups (Szabo et al., 1999; Buck et al., 2000; Parsey et al., 2000) and for [\n11\nC]DASB by Ginovart et al. (2001). Values of K\n1 \nreported in this study were high, indicating excellent extraction and brain penetration. The highest K\n1 \nvalues displayed by [\n11\nC]AFM and [\n11\nC]DASB might be related to higher free fraction in the plasma.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNot surprisingly, given its faster kinetic, the average regional minimal scanning time required to derive time-independent estimates of V\nT \nwas the shortest for [\n11\nC]DASB. The midbrain was the region in which a larger data set was required to derive time-independent estimates. In this region, 70 minutes were required for [\n11\nC]McN 5652, [\n11\nC]ADAM and [\n11\nC]AFM. [\n11\nC]DASB required only 60 minutes, and [\n11\nC]DAPA required 80 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is difficult to predict how these values would extrapolate to humans. The rate of metabolism for [\n11\nC]McN 5652 is slower in humans than in baboons: at 30 minutes, the [\n11\nC]McN 5652 parent fraction was 59±10% in humans (Parsey et al., 2000), compared to 28±13% measured here in baboons. The same was true for [\n11\nC]DASB: in humans, [\n11\nC]DASB parent fraction at 30 minutes was 40±7% (Ginovart et al., 2001), versus 20±1% measured here. The slower metabolism rate observed in humans might translate into slower brain uptake kinetics. Supporting this prediction, we observed that at least 120 minutes of data were required to derive stable [\n11\nC]McN 5652 V\nT \nestimates in the human midbrain (Parsey et al., 2000), versus 70 minutes in baboons (50 minutes difference). On the other hand, Ginovart et al. (2001) determined that no more than 80 minutes of data acquisition was required to derive stable V\nT \nvalues in all regions with [\n11\nC]DASB: this is only 20 minutes more than in the baboons. A fair conclusion would be that, with the exception of [\n11\nC]DASB, the new ligands evaluated here are unlikely to allow for a substantial reduction in scanning time in humans compared to [\n11\nC]McN 5652. However, a great uncertainty is associated with this prediction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNonspecific Binding\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe cerebellum distribution volume was uniformly high for all of these ligands (range of 10 to 30 mL g\n−1\n) [\n11\nC]McN 5652 V\nT CER \nmeasured in this study (27.7±4.0 mL g\n−1\n) was comparable to values previously reported in humans for [\n11\nC]McN 5652 in this laboratory (17.8±1.9 mL g\n−1\n, n=6) (Parsey et al., 2000) and another (11.9±3.3 mL g\n−1\n, n=8) (Buck et al., 2000). [\n11\nC]DASB V\nT CER \nmeasured here (17.3±0.5 mL g\n−1\n) was also comparable to [\n11\nC]DASB V\nT CER \nreported in humans (11.8±1.5 mL g\n−1\n, n=5) (Ginovart et al., 2001). [\n11\nC]ADAM V\nT CER \nmeasured in this study (28.5±4.8 mL g\n−1\n) was however much higher than [\n123\nI]ADAM V\nT CER \nmeasured previously with SPECT in baboons (2.25±0.46 mL g\n−1\n) (Acton et al., 1999a).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nV\nT CER \nvalues of these five SERT ligands were about one order of magnitude higher than V\nT CER \nvalues measured for other commonly used PET radioligands such as [\n11\nC]raclopride, [\n18\nF]fallypride [\n11\nC] WAY 100635 and [\n11\nC]NNC 112 (Lammertsma et al., 1996; Abi-Dargham et al., 2000a; Abi-Dargham et al., 2000b; Mawlawi et al., 2001a). However, they are comparable to values measured in humans for the DAT/SERT ligand [\n123\nI]β-CIT (28±3 mL g\n−1\n) (Laruelle et al., 1994a) and for the 5-HT2A receptor ligand [\n11\nC]MDL 100907 (18±4 mL g\n−1\n) (Mawlawi et al., 2001b). These high levels of nonspecific distribution volumes represent a major handicap to achieve high signal to noise ratio (V\n3\n″=BP/VTCER). In this regard, the significantly lower V\nT CER \nof [\n11\nC]DASB compared to the four other tracers provide an appreciable advantage for this ligand.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nReceptor Parameters\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[\n11\nC]AFM had the highest BP of the five ligands tested in this study. The magnitude of BP per se is not critical in defining the imaging qualities of a tracer. BP provides a measure of the signal, but the quality of the signal can only be appreciated in relationship to the noise. The ratio of BP to V\nT CER\n, namely V\n3\n″, is thus more related to imaging characteristics than BP itself. The main interest of calculating BP in this context is to relate this value to the B\nmax\n/K\nD \nratio. Under the assumption that the tracer crosses the blood brain barrier by passive diffusion (a widely accepted assumption that might not be true for all SSRI, see Rochat et al., 1999), BP as defined here is equal to f\n1\nB\nmax\n/K\nD\n. The derivation of the B\nmax\n/K\nD \nratio requires the knowledge of f\n1\n; and therefore this derivation was only feasible for [\n11\nC]DASB and [\n11\nC]AFM. Assuming that both ligands bind to the same population of transporter sites, which is a fair assumption, this calculation suggested that the in vivo affinity of [\n11\nC]AFM was 3.3 times higher than that of [\n11\nC]DASB. This conclusion was consistent with the in vitro data, which indicated a lower K\ni \nfor [\n11\nC]AFM compared to [\n11\nC]DASB, by a factor of 2.8 at room temperature and 4.4 at body temperature Table 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs previously stated, V\n3\n″ (=f\n2\nB\nmax\n/K\nD\n) was a decisive outcome measure of the present study for comparing these SERT ligands. In a given region (B\nmax \nbeing constant), higher V\n3\n″ means higher affinity (lower K\nD\n) and/or lower nonspecific binding (higher f\n2\n), improved signal to noise ratio and better measurement reliability. To increase V\n3\n″ above values observed with [\n11\nC]McN 5652 might not be critical (or even desirable) to measure SERT in regions of high density, such as the midbrain. However, it is essential for the measurement of SERT availability in regions of lower density, such as the neocortex and the limbic system. The vast majority of postmortem findings implicating alterations of SERT density in psychiatric disorders have been observed in the neocortex and the limbic system. For example, in schizophrenia, abnormalities of SERT density in postmortem studies appear to be localized to the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, while other areas of the neocortex are preserved (Joyce et al., 1993; Laruelle et al., 1993a; Dean et al., 1995; Gurevich and Joyce, 1997). Using [\n123\nI]β-CIT, we observed normal SERT level in the midbrain of patients with schizophrenia (Laruelle et al., 2000a). Thus, schizophrenia is an example of a condition in which a SERT ligand capable of quantifying the SERT concentrations in regions of relatively low density is desirable.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n[\n11\nC]McN 5652 V\n3\n″ values measured in baboons in this study were consistent with values previously measured in six healthy humans (Parsey et al., 2000), with some noticeable discrepancies, presumably due to species differences: in humans, [\n11\nC]McN 5652 V\n3\n″ in the midbrain region was much higher than the thalamus (1.63 versus 0.92, respectively), and this was not the case in baboons (0.94 versus 1.04). Striatal V\n3\n″ was comparable to thalamus V\n3\n″ in humans (1.03 versus 0.92, respectively), but significantly lower in baboons (0.64 versus 1.04). Regarding limbic and cortical regions, the hippocampus, temporal cortex, cingulate cortex and occipital cortex regions showed comparable and low [\n11\nC]McN 5652 V\n3\n″ in humans (0.49, 0.22, 0.21 and 0.17, respectively) and baboons (0.34, 0.23, 0.19 and 0.11). Thus, based on [\n11\nC]McN 5652 data acquired in the same laboratory, cortical V\n3\n″ measured in baboons appear to be a fair predictor of values observed in humans. On the other hand, [\n11\nC]DASB V\n3\n″ reported by Ginovart in the occipital cortex in humans (0.51±0.09) were higher than that measured in baboons in this study (0.11±0.06), using a similar modeling strategy. At this point, it is unclear if this discrepancy reflects species difference or methodological difference in image analysis between laboratories.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompared to [\n11\nC]McN 5652, [\n11\nC]ADAM provided a modest improvement in V\n3\n″. Combining all regions, [\n11\nC]ADAM V\n3\n″ expressed in percentage of [\n11\nC]McN 5652 V\n3\n″ was only 128±24%. [\n11\nC]DASB and [\n11\nC]DAPA provided more significant V\n3\n″ improvement over [\n11\nC]McN 5652 ([\n11\nC]DASB and [\n11\nC]DAPA V\n3\n″ were 142±29% and 151±18% higher than [\n11\nC]McN 5652 V\n3\n″, respectively). Finally, [\n11\nC]AFM provided the most significant improvement, with V\n3\n″ values almost twice of that for [\n11\nC]McN 5652 (193±35%). These results suggest that, among the ligands tested in this study, [\n11\nC]AFM should be the ligand of choice to measure SERT availability in limbic and neocortical regions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThis study did not include examination of the prefrontal cortex. Because of the close proximity of this structure to the striatum in baboons, counts in the prefrontal cortex are contaminated by spill-over from the striatum. In humans, [\n11\nC]McN 5652 V\n3\n″ was not significantly different from zero in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex, and barely above background in the medial prefrontal cortex (V\n3\n″=0.08) (Parsey et al., 2000). This observation does not mean that SERT is absent in these regions, but that the specific binding of the radioligand was negligible. Thus, while data from the present study suggest that [\n11\nC]AFM will provide adequate specific signal in hippocampus, temporal, and cingulate cortex, the evaluation of the ability of this tracer to visualize and quantify SERT in the prefrontal cortex will require human studies.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe observation that the relative improvement in V\n3\n″ of the new ligands over [\n11\nC]McN 5652 was not uniform across regions was unexpected. Under the assumption that the nonspecific binding and the affinity for SERT of a given ligand are constant across regions, V\n3\n″ should be related to B\nmax \nby a region-independent constant. Therefore, if all tracers bind to the same population of transporter sites, relative regional differences in V\n3\n″ should be constant across tracers. To test this prediction, V\n3\n″ values were normalized to the thalamus V\n3\n″ and compared. The expectation for the absence of significant between-tracer differences in normalized V\n3\n″ was generally confirmed (no significant between-tracer differences were observed). However, the presence of a significant tracer by region interaction in this test suggested that in some regions, significant between-tracer differences were encountered in normalized V\n3\n″. In fact, normalized [\n11\nC]ADAM and [\n11\nC]McN 5652 V\n3\n″ were greater than expected in the striatum, and normalized [\n11\nC]ADAM V\n3\n″ was also greater than expected in the limbic and temporal regions (\nFIG. 13\n). This observation was reminiscent of the observation reported by Choi et al. (2000) in rats with [\n123\nI]ADAM: in the hippocampus, the nonspecific binding, measured by [\n123\nI]ADAM accumulation in rats pretreated with 2 mg/kg of unlabelled ADAM, was much higher than other regions. Similarly, in baboons interregional differences in nonspecific binding might affect V\n3\n″ values, especially in regions with low V\n3\n″. Homologous blocking experiments are required to further clarify this issue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs two experiments were obtained with each ligand in each of the two baboons, an estimate of V\n3\n″ measurement reproducibility could be calculated. These estimates should be taken with caution, as they are derived from only two pairs of observation. Nonetheless, the relative variability between regions and tracers in reproducibility is relatively consistent with what could be predicted from the respective properties of these regions and tracers: thus, regions of large size and greater V\n3\n″ (thalamus and striatum) generally showed a better reproducibility compared to regions of smaller size (midbrain) or V\n3\n″ (cortex). Tracers with higher V\n3\n″ ([\n11\nC]AFM and [\n11\nC]DAPA) behave better than tracers with lower V\n3\n″ ([\n11\nC]McN 5652 and [\n11\nC]ADAM), with [\n11\nC]DASB occupying an intermediate position.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOverall Evaluation\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamination of Table 14 shows that, for parameters evaluated in vivo, [\n11\nC]DASB and [\n11\nC]AFM emerge as superior radioligands. Compared to [\n11\nC]McN 5652, [\n11\nC]ADAM does not appear to provide a clear advantage as a PET imaging agent. However, [\n123\nI]ADAM is a very useful and advantageous SPECT radioligand compared to [\n123\nI]β-CIT. [\n11\nC]DAPA provides some advantage over [\n11\nC]McN 5652 in terms of V\n3\n″ and reproducibility, but these improvements are hampered by a relatively slower kinetic and longer required imaging time. [\n11\nC]DASB is a superior ligand compared to [\n11\nC]McN 5652, as it provides both higher V\n3\n″ and shorter imaging time. For studies in which measurement of limbic and cortical regions are not essential, such as in drug occupancy studies, [\n11\nC]DASB is clearly the tracer of choice among the ones tested here. In addition, [\n11\nC]DASB has already been evaluated in humans (Houle et al., 2000; Ginovart et al., 2001; Meyer et al., 2001), and the excellent qualities of this tracer observed in animal studies have already been confirmed in humans. On the other hand, [\n11\nC]AFM might offer distinct advantages for the measurement of SERT in regions of relatively low densities. [\n11\nC]AFM V\n3\n″ was significantly higher than all the other tracers evaluated here. The key factor to determine the usefulness of [\n11\nC]AFM in human studies will be the time required to reach time-independent estimate of V\nT\n. Another attractive feature of [\n11\nC]AFM is that this ligand can be radiolabeled with F-18. The use of [\n18\nF]AFM might make the issue of scan duration less critical, and thus make it possible to take full advantage of the higher V\n3\n″ offered by this ligand. In addition, [\n18\nF]AFM would make SERT imaging available in PET centers without an on-site cyclotron, given that the distribution network for F-18 labeled PET compounds is currently established. For all these reasons, further evaluation of [\n11\nC]AFM and [\n18\nF]AFM in humans is warranted.\n\n\n \nD. Conclusion\n\n\n \n \n \nFour newly developed SERT radioligands were evaluated and compared to the reference tracer [\n11\nC]McN 5652 under identical experimental conditions. Overall, [\n11\nC]ADAM and [\n11\nC]DAPA do not appear to present a clear advantage over [\n11\nC]McN 5652 as PET imaging agents. On the other hand, [\n11\nC]DASB, because of its fast kinetic, and [\n11\nC]AFM, because of its higher signal to noise ratio, appear to be superior radioligands for the imaging SERT in baboons using PET. Studies in humans comparing [\n11\nC]McN 5652, [\n11\nC]DASB and [\n11\nC]AFM are warranted to confirm the results of the present study.\n\n\n \n \nExperiment\n 4\n\n\nImaging Study in Baboons with [\n11\nC]AFM and [\n18\nF]AFM\n\n\n \n \n \nOne baboon was studied with both [\n11\nC]AFM and [\n18\nF]AFM. [\n11\nC]AFM was injected first (4.82 mCi, SA of 1240 Ci/mmol, mass of 1.05 μg) and scanned for 90 minutes. The animal was then injected with [\n18\nF]AFM (2.60 mCi, 425 Ci/mmol, 1.51 μg) and scanned for 90 minutes. Analysis of the input function and brain uptake was performed as described in the previous section. Table 15 shows the percent of plasma activity corresponding to the parent compound for each radiotracer. Arterial activity was corrected for parent fraction to form the input function. As expected, the input functions of the parent compound were similar for both tracers, with clearance of 31 and 54 L/hour for [\n11\nC] and [\n18\nF] labeled compounds, respectively.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTABLE 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent plasma activity corresponding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto the parent compound (same baboon).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime (minutes)\n\n\n[\n11\nC] AFM\n\n\n[\n18\nF] \nAFM\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n75.6%\n\n\n63.5%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n55.4%\n\n\n40.0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12\n\n\n21.4%\n\n\n21.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n9.4%\n\n\n8.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60\n\n\n6.4%\n\n\n5.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n90\n\n\n6.7%\n\n\n4.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe distribution (\nFIG. 16\n) and kinetics (\nFIG. 15\n) of brain regional uptake of [\n11\nC]AFM and [\n18\nF]AFM were also similar. Data were analyzed with a one tissue compartment model. Values of V\n3\n″ (\nFIG. 15B\n) were essentially the same for both tracers (for example, thalamus V\n3\n″ was 2.26 for [\n11\nC]AFM and 2.27 for [\n18\nF]AFM).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTaken together, results from experiments in both rats and baboon suggest that [\n18\nF]AFM behaves essentially the same as [\n11\nC]AFM in vivo. One of the main concerns when evaluating [\n18\nF]AFM in comparison to [\n11\nC]AFM was the presence of radiolabeled metabolites in the brain. This concern of significant contamination by radiolabeled metabolite can be excluded on the fact that V\n3\n″ in baboon was similar between both tracers (in case of significant brain penetration of radiolabeled metabolites following [\n18\nF]AFM injection, [\n18\nF]AFM V\n3\n″ should be reduced since “nonspecific binding” would be higher). These data indicated that even though the two tracers might produce different radiolabeled metabolites, these metabolites are not able to cross into the brain and confound the imaging signal.\n\n\n \nExperiment 5\n\n\nFurther Characterization of [\n18\nF]AFA, [\n18\nF]AFM, and [\n18\nF]AFE in Imaging Studies in Baboons and Comparison with their C-11 Labeled Counterparts\n\n\nImaging Data:\n\n\n \n \n \nScans with [\n11\nC]AFM, [\n18\nF]AFM, [\n11\nC]AFA, [\n18\nF]AFA, [\n11\nC]AFE, [\n18\nF]AFA were acquired on one adult male baboon. General scanning methods were as described in Huang et al. (2002). Injected dose and specific activities at time of injection are provided in Table 16.

Highest uptake was noted in midbrain, thalamus and striatum. Data were analyzed with a two-compartment model, using the metabolite-corrected arterial time-activity curve as input function. This analysis provided the regional distribution volumes (V\nT\n, mL/g).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe nonspecific distribution volume, measured as the distribution volume of the cerebellum (a region with negligible SERT density) was in a similar range for all tracers (10 to 30 mL/g, Table 16).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe specific to nonspecific partition coefficient, V\n3\n″, was calculated as the ratio of V\nT \nin the region of interest (ROI) to cerebellum V\nT \nminus one. V\n3\n″ provides a measure related to receptor parameters as follows:\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nV\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n″\n\n\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nB\n \n \n\n\nmax\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nV\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nK\n\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nwhere B\nmax \nis the maximal density of sites, V\n2 \nis the nonspecific distribution volume (equal to cerebellum V\nT\n) and K\nD \nis the in vivo affinity of the radiotracer for the target. V\n3\n″ in midbrain, thalamus, striatum, cingulate cortex, temporal cortex, parietal cortex, and occipital cortex are presented in \nFIG. 17\n. The parameter V\n3\n″ is the most important parameter to evaluate the suitability of a tracer to image the target of interest, as it is directly related to the signal to noise contrast.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRegional variations in V\n3\n″ for all tracer evaluated were consistent with regional variations in SERT density. Two observations appear to be supported by these data:\n\n \n \n \n1. For all tracers, V\n3\n″ measured with \n11\nC labeled compound and \n18\nF labeled compound were similar.\n \n2. Regional V\n3\n″ of [\n11\nC]/[\n18\nF]AFM were higher than those of [\n11\nC]/[\n18\nF]AFA and [\n11\nC]/[\n18\nF]AFE, presumably due to the higher affinity of AFM for SERT compared to the other two compounds.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nIn conclusion, all radiotracers appear to be suitable for imaging the SERT in the living brain. Among the radioligands evaluated, [\n11\nC]/[\n18\nF]AFM provides the highest signal to noise ratios and V\n3\n″ in all brain regions. Development of [\n18\nF]AFM and related radioligands should allow the emergence of PET radioligands that possess the dual features of superior in vivo imaging properties and feasibility for wide distribution and applications.\n\n\n \nREFERENCES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n1.
