Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIELD OF INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention relates to the prevention and treatment of muscle wasting disorders. More particularly, this invention relates to a method of treating, preventing, suppressing, inhibiting, or reducing the incidence of muscle wasting in a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder, by administering to the subject a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) compound and/or its analog, derivative, isomer, metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate, N-oxide, or any combination thereof.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nMuscle wasting refers to the progressive loss of muscle mass and/or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles, including the skeletal or voluntary muscles, which control movement, cardiac muscles, which control the heart (cardiomyopathics), and smooth muscles. Chronic muscle wasting is a chronic condition (i.e. persisting over a long period of time) characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass, weakening and degeneration of muscle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein degradation by catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation, an unusually low rate of protein synthesis, or a combination of both. Muscle protein catabolism, whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis, leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscle wasting is associated with chronic, neurological, genetic or infectious pathologies, diseases, illnesses or conditions. These include Muscular Dystrophies such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Myotonic Dystrophy; Muscle Atrophies such as Post-Polio Muscle Atrophy (PPMA); Cachexias such as Cardiac Cachexia, AIDS Cachexia and Cancer Cachexia, malnutrition, Leprosy, Diabetes, Renal Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cancer, end stage Renal failure, Sarcopenia, Emphysema, Osteomalacia, HIV Infection, AIDS, and Cardiomyopathy,\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, other circumstances and conditions are linked to and can cause muscle wasting. These include chronic lower back pain, advanced age, central nervous system (CNS) injury, peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury, chemical injury, central nervous system (CNS) damage, peripheral nerve damage, spinal cord damage, chemical damage, burns, disuse deconditioning that occurs when a limb is immobilized, long term hospitalization due to illness or injury, and alcoholism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn intact androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway is crucial for appropriate development of skeletal muscles. Furthermore, an intact AR-signalling pathway increases lean muscle mass, muscle strength and muscle protein synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscle wasting, if left unabated, can have dire health consequences. For example, the changes that occur during muscle wasting can lead to a weakened physical state that is detrimental to an individual's health, resulting in increased susceptibility to infraction and poor performance status. In addition, muscle wasting is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from cachexia and AIDS. Innovative approaches are urgently needed at both the basic science and clinical levels to prevent and treat muscle wasting, in particular chronic muscle wasting. The present invention is directed to satisfying this need.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention provides: 1) a method of treating a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder;

The term \"pharmaceutical product\" means a composition suitable for pharmaceutical use (pharmaceutical composition), as defined herein.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBiological Activity of Selective Androgen Modulator Compounds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs contemplated herein, the SARM compounds of the present invention as useful in treating, preventing, suppressing, inhibiting or reducing the incidence of muscle wasting disorders, as defined herein. An intact androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway is crucial for appropriate development of skeletal muscles. Furthermore, an intact AR-signalling pathway increases lean muscle mass, muscle strength and muscle protein synthesis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA muscle is a tissue of the body that primarily functions as a source of power. There are three types of muscles in the body: a) skeletal muscle -the muscle responsible for moving extremities and external areas of the bodies; b) cardiac muscle - the heart muscle; and c) smooth muscle - the muscle that is in the walls of arteries and bowel.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA wasting condition or disorder is defined herein as a condition or disorder that is characterized, at least in part, by an abnormal, progressive loss of body, organ or tissue mass. A wasting condition can occur as a result of a pathology such as, for example, cancer, or it can be due to a physiologic or metabolic state, such as disuse deconditioning that can occur, for example, due to prolonged bed rest or when a limb is immobilized, such as in a cast. A wasting condition can also be age associated. The loss of body mass that occurs during a wasting condition can be characterized by a loss of total body weight, or a loss of organ weight such as a loss of bone or muscle mass due to a decrease in tissue protein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe terms \"muscle wasting\" or \"muscular wasting\", used herein interchangeably, refer to the progressive loss of muscle mass and/or to the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles, including the skeletal or voluntary muscles which control movement, cardiac muscles which control the heart, and smooth muscles. In one embodiment, the muscle wasting condition or disorder is a chronic muscle wasting condition or disorder. \"chronic muscle wasting\" is defined herein as the chronic (i.e. persisting over a long period of time) progressive loss of muscle mass and/or to the chronic progressiveweakening and degeneration of muscle.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein breakdown or degradation, by muscle protein catabolism. Protein catabolism occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation, an unusually low rate of protein synthesis, or a combination of both. Protein catabolism or depletion, whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis, leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting. The term \"catabolism.\" has its commonly known meaning in the art, specifically an energy burning form of metabolism.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscle wasting can occur as a result of a pathology, disease, condition or disorder. In one embodiment, the pathology, illness, disease or condition is chronic. In another embodiment, the pathology, illness, disease or condition is genetic. In another embodiment, the pathology, illness, disease or condition is neurological. In another embodiment, the pathology, illness, disease or condition is infectious. As described herein, the pathologies, diseases, conditions or disorders for which the compounds and compositions of the present invention are administered are those that directly or indirectly produce a wasting (i.e. loss) of muscle mass, that is a muscle wasting disorder.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThese include but are not limited to Muscular Dystrophies; Muscle Atrophies; Cachexias ; malnutrition, Leprosy, Diabetes, Renal Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cancer, end stage Renal failure, Sarcopenia, Emphysema, Osteomalacia, HIV Infection, AIDS, or Cardiomyopathy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the muscle wasting disorder is due to an infectious disease such as enterovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes zoster, HIV, trypanosomiasis, influenze, coxsacke, infectious mononucleosis, Rickettsia, Trichinella, or Schistosomiasis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe muscular dystrophies are genetic diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of the skeletal or voluntary muscles that control movement. The muscles of the heart and some other involuntary muscles are also affected in some forms of muscular dystrophy. The major forms of Muscular Dystrophy are: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Becker Muscular Dystrophy, Limb-girdle Muscular Dystrophy, Facioscapulhumeral Muscular Dystrophy, Congenital Muscular Dystrophy, Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy, Distal Muscular Dystrophy and Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscular Dystrophy can affect people of all ages. Although some forms first become apparent in infancy or childhood, others may not appear until middle age or later. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is the most common kind of Muscular Dystrophy affecting children. Myotonic Dystrophy is the most common of these diseases in adults.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscle Atrophy is characterized by wasting away or diminution of muscle and a decrease in muscle mass. For example, Post-Polio Muscular Atrophy is a muscle wasting that occurs as part of the Post-Polio Syndrome (PPS). The Atrophy includes weakness, muscle fatigue, and pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAnother type of Muscular Atrophy is X-linked spinal-bulbar Muscular Atrophy (SBMA - also known as Kennedy\n'\ns Disease). This disease arises from a defect in the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome, affects only males, and its onset is in adulthood. Because the primary disease cause is an androgen receptor mutation, androgen replacement is not a current therapeutic strategy. There are some investigational studies where exogenous testosterone propionate is being given to boost the levels of androgen with hopes of overcoming androgen insensitivity and perhaps provide an anabolic effect. Still, use of supraphysiological levels of testosterone for supplementation will have limitations and other potentially serious complications.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCachexia is weakness and a loss of weight caused by a disease or as a side effect of illness. Cardiac Cachexia, i.e. a muscle protein wasting of both the cardiac and skeletal muscle, is a characteristic of congestive heart failure. Cancer Cachexia is a syndrome that occurs in patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies and is manifested by weight loss with massive depletion of both adipose tissue and lean muscle mass. Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Cachexia is a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) associated myopathy and/or muscle weakness/wasting that is a relatively common clinical manifestation of AIDS. Individuals with HIV-associated myopathy or muscle weakness or wasting typically experience significant weight loss, generalized or proximal muscle weakness, tenderness, and muscle atrophy.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSarcopenia is a debilitating disease that afflicts the elderly and chronically ill patients and is characterized by loss of muscle mass and function [\nNair K.S. Mayo Clin Proc 2000 Jan; 75 Suppl:S14-8\n]. It is well established that anabolic steroids can prevent and/or reverse losses in lean body mass (decrease in skeletal muscle mass) associated with age, disease and trauma injury [\nSheffield-Moore, Ann. Med. 32:181-186, 2000\n; \nBhasin, S. Mayo Clin Proc 2000 Jan; 75 Suppl:S70-5\n]. Further, increased lean body mass is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality for certain muscle-wasting disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, other circumstances and conditions are linked to, and can cause muscle wasting disorders. For example, studies have shown that in severe cases of chronic lower back pain, there is paraspinal muscle wasting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMuscle wasting is also associated with advanced age. It is believed that general weakness in old age is due to muscle wasting. As the body ages, an increasing proportion of skeletal muscle is replaced by fibrous tissue. The result is a significant reduction in muscle power, performance and endurance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nLong term hospitalization due to illness or injury, or disuse deconditioning that occurs, for example, when a limb is immobilized, can also lead to muscle wasting. Studies have shown that in patients suffering injuries, chronic illnesses, burns, trauma or cancer, who are hospitalized for long periods of time, there is a long-lasting unilateral muscle wasting, with a consequent decrease in body mass.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nInjuries or damage to the Central Nervous System (CNS) are also associated with muscle wasting disorders. Injuries or damage to the CNS can be, for example, caused by diseases, trauma or chemicals. Examples are central nerve injury or damage, peripheral nerve injury or damage and spinal cord injury or damage.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, alcoholism has been shown to be associated with muscle wasting disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs contemplated herein, this invention provides a class of compounds which are Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM) compounds. These compounds, which are useful in preventing and treating muscle wasting disorders are classified as androgen receptor agonists (AR agonists), partial agonists or androgen receptor antagonists (AR antagonists).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA receptor agonist is a substance which binds receptors and activates them. A receptor partial agonist is a substance which binds receptor and partially activate them. A receptor antagonist is a substance which binds receptors and inactivates them. As demonstrated herein, the SARM compounds of the present invention have a tissue-selective effect, wherein one agent may be an agonist, partial agonist and/or antagonist, depending on the tissue. For example, the SARM compound may stimulate muscle tissue and at the same time inhibit prostate tissue. In one embodiment, the SARMs which are useful in treating and preventing muscle wasting disorders are AR agonists, and are, therefore, useful in binding to and activating the AR. In another embodiment, the SARMs are AR antagonists, and are, therefore, useful in binding to and inactivating the AR. Assays to determine whether the compounds of the present invention are AR agonists or antagonists are well known to a person skilled in the art. For example, AR agonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to maintain and/or stimulate the growth of AR containing tissue such as prostate and seminal vesicles, as measured by weight. AR antagonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds inhibit the growth of AR containing tissue.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention can be classified as partial AR agonist/antagonists. The SARMs are AR agonists in some tissues, to cause increased transcription of AR-responsive genes (e.g. muscle anabolic effect). In other tissues, these compounds serve as competitive inhibitors of testosterone/DHT on the AR to prevent agonistic effects of the native androgens.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe SARM compounds of the present invention bind either reversibly or irreversibly to the androgen receptor. In one embodiment, the SARM compounds bind reversibly to the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the SARM compounds bind irreversibly to the androgen receptor. The compounds of the present invention may contain a functional group (affinity label) that allows alkylation of the androgen receptor (i.e. covalent bond formation). Thus, in this case, the compounds bind irreversibly to the receptor and, accordingly, cannot be displaced by a steroid, such as the endogenous ligands DHT and testosterone.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present invention provides a safe and effective method for treating, preventing, suppressing, inhibiting or reducing loss of muscle and/or muscle protein catabolism due to muscle wasting and is particularly useful for treating a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder. In one embodiment, the subject is a mammalian subject. In another embodiment, the subject is a human subject. In another embodiment, the subject is a male subject. In another embodiment, the subject is a female subject.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis invention provides the use of a composition and a pharmaceutical composition for treating a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder; for preventing a muscle wasting disorder; for treating, preventing, suppressing, inhibiting or reducing muscle loss in a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder; for treating, preventing, inhibiting, reducing or suppressing muscle wasting in a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder; and for treating, preventing, inhibiting, reducing or suppressing muscle protein catabolism in a subject suffering from a muscle wasting disorder by administering a selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) and/or its analog, derivative, isomer, metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product, hydrate, N-oxide, or any combination thereof; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, \"pharmaceutical composition\" means a \"therapeutically effective amount\" of the active ingredient, i.e. the SARM compound, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. A \"therapeutically effective amount\" as used herein refers to that amount which provides a therapeutic effect for a given condition and administration regimen.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical compositions containing the SARM agent can be administered to a subject by any method known to a person skilled in the art, such as parenterally, paracancerally, transmucosally, transdermally, intramuscularly, intravenously, intradermally, subcutaneously, intraperitonealy, intraventricularly, intracranially, intravaginally or intratumorally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered orally, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for oral administration, i.e. as a solid or a liquid preparation.

In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intraarterially, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intraarterial administration. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered intramuscularly, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for intramuscular administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered topically to body surfaces, and are thus formulated in a form suitable for topical administration. Suitable topical formulations include gels, ointments, creams, lotions, drops and the like. For topical administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are prepared and applied as solutions, suspensions, or emulsions in a physiologically acceptable diluent with or without a pharmaceutical carrier.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurther, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered as a suppository, for example a rectal suppository or a urethral suppository. Further, in another embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered by subcutaneous implantation of a pellet. In a further embodiment, the pellet provides for controlled release of SARM agent over a period of time.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the active compound can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see \nLanger, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n); \nTreat et al., in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez- Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989\n); \nLopez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327\n; see generally ibid).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein \"pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents\" are well known to those skilled in the art. The carrier or diluent may be a solid carrier or diluent for solid formuations, a liquid carrier or diluent for liquid formulations, or mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolid carriers/diluents include, but are not limited to, a gum, a starch (e.g. corn starch, pregeletanized starch), a sugar (e.g., lactose, mannitol, sucrose, dextrose), a cellulosic material (e.g. microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose), a cyclodextrin, an acrylate (e.g. polymethylacrylate), calcium carbonate, magnesium oxide, talc, or mixtures thereof.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor liquid formulations, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions or oils. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Examples of oils are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, and fish-liver oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nParenteral vehicles (for subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, or intramuscular injection) include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's and fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers such as those based on Ringer's dextrose, and the like. Examples are sterile liquids such as water and oils, with or without the addition of a surfactant and other pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants. In general, water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, and glycols such as propylene glycols or polyethylene glycol are preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Examples of oils are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, and fish-liver oil.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the compositions may further comprise binders (e.g. acacia, cornstarch, gelatin, carbomer, ethyl cellulose, guar gum, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, povidone), disintegrating agents (e.g. cornstarch, potato starch, alginic acid, silicon dioxide, croscarmelose sodium, crospovidone, guar gum, sodium starch glycolate), buffers (e.g., Tris-HCl., acetate, phosphate) of various pH and ionic strength, additives such as albumin or gelatin to prevent absorption to surfaces, detergents (e.g., Tween 20, Tween 80, Pluronic F68, bile acid salts), protease inhibitors, surfactants (e.g. sodium lauryl sulfate), permeation enhancers, solubilizing agents (e.g., glycerol, polyethylene glycerol), anti-oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite, butylated hydroxyanisole), stabilizers (e.g. hydroxypropyl cellulose, hyroxypropylmethyl cellulose), viscosity increasing agents(e.g. carbomer, colloidal silicon dioxide, ethyl cellulose, guar gum), sweetners (e.g. aspartame, citric acid), preservatives (e.g., Thimerosal, benzyl alcohol, parabens), lubricants (e.g. stearic acid, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate), flow-aids (e.g. colloidal silicon dioxide), plasticizers (e.g. diethyl phthalate, triethyl citrate), emulsifiers (e.g. carbomer, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate), polymer coatings (e.g., poloxamers or poloxamines), coating and film forming agents (e.g. ethyl cellulose, acrylates, polymethacrylates) and/or adjuvants.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are controlled release compositions, i.e. compositions in which the SARM compound is released over a period of time after administration. Controlled or sustained release compositions include formulation in lipophilic depots (e.g. fatty acids, waxes, oils). In another embodiment, the composition is an immediate release composition, i.e. a composition in which all of the SARM compound is released immediately after administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn yet another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in controlled release system. For example, the agent may administered using intravenous infusion, an implantable osmotic pump, a transdermal patch, liposomes, or other modes of administration. In one embodiment, a pump may be used (see Langer, supra; \nSefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987\n); \nBuchwald et al., Surgery 88:507 (1980\n); \nSaudek et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989\n). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used. In yet another embodiment, a controlled release system can be placed in proximity to the therapeutic target, i.e., the brain, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose (see, e.g., \nGoodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984\n). Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by \nLanger (Science 249:1527-1533 (1990\n).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compositions may also include incorporation of the active material into or onto particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polglycolic acid, hydrogels, etc, or onto liposomes, microemulsions, micelles, unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles, erythrocyte ghosts, or spheroplasts.) Such compositions will influence the physical state, solubility, stability, rate of \nin vivo\n release, and rate \nof in vivo\n clearance.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso comprehended by the invention are particulate compositions coated with polymers (e.g. poloxamers or poloxamines) and the compound coupled to antibodies directed against tissue-specific receptors, ligands or antigens or coupled to ligands of tissue-specific receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAlso comprehended by the invention are compounds modified by the covalent attachment of water-soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol, copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol, carboxymethyl cellulose, dextran, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyproline. The modified compounds are known to exhibit substantially longer half-lives in blood following intravenous injection than do the corresponding unmodified compounds (Abuchowski et al., 1981; Newmark et al., 1982; and Katre et al., 1987). Such modifications-may-also-increase-the-compound's--solebility-in-aqueous-solution, eliminate aggregation, enhance the physical and chemical stability of the compound, and greatly reduce the immunogenicity and reactivity of the compound.\n\nAs a result, the desired \nin vivo\n biological activity may be achieved by the administration of such polymer-compound abducts less frequently or in lower doses than with the unmodified compound.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe preparation of pharmaceutical compositions which contain an active component is well understood in the art, for example by mixing, granulating, or tablet-forming processes. The active therapeutic ingredient is often mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient. For oral administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are mixed with additives customary for this purpose, such as vehicles, stabilizers, or inert diluents, and converted by customary methods into suitable forms for administration, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard or soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. For parenteral administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are converted into a solution, suspension, or emulsion, if desired with the substances customary and suitable for this purpose, for example, solubilizers or other.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAn active component can be formulated into the composition as neutralized pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide or antibody molecule), which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, mandelic, and the like. Salts formed from the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor use in medicine, the salts of the SARM will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of the compounds according to the invention or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic: acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs defined herein, \"contacting\" means that the SARM compound of the present invention is introduced into a sample containing the enzyme in a test tube, flask, tissue culture, chip, array, plate, microplate, capillary, or the like, and incubated at a temperature and time sufficient to permit binding of the SARM to the enzyme.

Incubation methods are also standard and are known to those skilled in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another embodiment, the term \"contacting\" means that the SARM compound of the present invention is introduced into a subject receiving treatment, and the SARM compound is allowed to come in contact with the androgen receptor \nin vivo.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, the term \"treating\" includes preventative as well as disorder remitative treatment. As used herein, the terms \"reducing\", \"suppressing\" and \"inhibiting\" have their commonly understood meaning of lessening or decreasing. As used herein, the term \"progression\" means increasing in scope or severity, advancing, growing or becoming worse. As used herein, the term \"recurrence\" means the return of a disease after a remission.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein; the term \"administering\" refers to bringing a subject in contact with a SARM compound of the present invention. As used herein, administration can be accomplished \nin vitro,\n i.e. in a test tube, \nor in vivo,\n i.e. in cells or tissues of living organisms, for example humans. In one embodiment, the present invention encompasses administering the compounds of the present invention to a subject.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn one embodiment, the methods of the present invention comprise administering a SARM compound as the sole active ingredient. However, also encompassed within the scope of the present invention are methods for 1) treating a muscle wasting disorder; 2) preventing a muscle wasting disorder; 3) treating, preventing, suppressing, inhibiting or reducing muscle loss due to a muscle wasting disorder; 4) treating, preventing, inhibiting, reducing or suppressing muscle wasting due to a muscle wasting disorder; and/or 5) treating, preventing, inhibiting, reducing or suppressing muscle protein catabolism due to a muscle wasting disorder, which comprise administering the SARM compounds in combination with one or more therapeutic agents.

They should in no way be construed, however, as limiting the broad scope of the invention.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS SECTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect of Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMS) and testosterone on skeletal muscles in intact female rats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompound V (N-[4-nitro-3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]- (2S)-3-[4-(acetylamino) phenoxy]-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamide), is a selective androgen receptor modulator represented by the formula:\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompound V is a ligand for AR with potent binding affinity, exhibits tissue-selective androgenic and anabolic effects, and is orally bioavailable. Compound V is a powerful anabolic agent that maintains the mass of the levator ani in castrated male rats.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMyosin heavy chain (MHC) is the predominant protein in skeletal muscle encoded by a multigene family expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner [\nAdams G.R., Zeng S.A., Baldwin K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 276:R954-R961, 1999\n]. To further demonstrate the importance of compound V in muscle, the effects of this nonsteroidal anabolic agent directly in skeletal muscle by monitoring the expression of MHC subtypes using RT-PCR has been demonstrated. In steady state, mRNA expression usually parallels the pattern of MHC protein expression. Because transcription of MHC mRNA occurs in advance of MHC protein translation, and the increased sensitivity of RT-PCR compared to western blotting, rapid changes in mRNA expression can be detected and used to analyze the subtle dynamic effects of muscle anabolism [\nWright C., Haddad F., Qin A. X., Baldwin K.M. J. Appl. Phys. 83 (4):1389-1396, 1997\n].\n\n\n \n\n\nMethods:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nRat muscle tissue was harvested in 5 volumes of RNA later solution (Ambion, cat.# 7020) and stored at 4°C until used for RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated in the FastPrep FP120 instrument (Qbiogene) using RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion, cat # 1914) in combination with FastRNA green tubes (Qbiogene, cat.# 6040-600) at settings for time at 45 sec and speed at 6.5. 1 ug of total RNA was used for reverse transcription using Retroscript kit (Ambion, cat# 1710). The mixture was incubated at 42°C for 60 min, followed by 10 min at 92°C, and then chilled on ice and used in PCR reaction.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelatively quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze expression of MHC mRNA in rat musculus masseter (MM) and levator ani (LA). As an internal standard 18S ribosomal RNA was used (QuantumRNA classic 18S Internal Standard, Ambion, cat.# 1716). Linear range of PCR reaction for all primers as well as optimal ratio of 185 primers to competitors to achieve the same level of amplification as the genes of interest was determined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPrimers were obtained from IDT based on the recently published design (\nWright et al., J. Appl. Phys. 1997;83:1389\n), with the following sequence: 5'GAAGGCCAAGAAGGCCATC3'.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTo design a perfect match of upstream primers for the neonatal sequence, slight modifications of the above common primer was necessary (Table1). The optimal annealing temperature of these degenerate common primers was, however, unchanged, and they were used in the same manner as the common primer as 5'-oligonucleotides for PCR reactions. The 3'-oligonucleotides used in the PCR reactions were designed from the 3'-untranslated regions of each of the different MHC genes, where the sequences are highly specific for each MHC gene [Wright et al 1997]:\n\n \nTable 1. \nOligonucleotide primers used for PCR amplification reactions\n \n \n \n \nMHC\n\nsubtype\n \nCommon Primer\n \nAntisense Primer\n \n \n \n \nIIb\n \n5'GAAGGCCAAGAAGGCCATC3'\n \n5'GTGTGATTTCTTCTGTCACC3'\n \n \n \nIIx\n \n5'GAAGGCCAAGAAGGCCATC3'\n \n5'GGTCACTTTCCTGCTTTGGA3'\n \n \n \nneonatal\n \n5'GAAGGCCAAGAAGGCCATC3'\n \n5'GCGGCCTCCTCAAGATGCGT3'\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \n5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche, cat# 1146165), 200 µM of each dNTP (Invitrogen, cat.#R725-01), 0.2 µM each MHC primer (IDT), 1 µl of cDNA from reverse transcription reaction and 4 µl of 18S primers : competitors mixture were used in 50 µl PCR reaction. Amplification was carried out in PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research, Inc.) with an initial denaturation step of 3 min at 94°C, followed by optimized number of cycles for the MHC primer pair, with each cycle consisting of 45 sec at 94°C, 60 sec at 48°C, 90 sec 72°C, and a final step of 5 min at 72°C. PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis [20-µl aliquots of a 50-µl PCR reaction loaded on a 1.5% agarose gel (in 1x Tris-Acetate-EDTA buffer) containing 0.2µg/ml ethidium bromide] to visualize the PCR products. Gels were photographed under ultraviolet (UV) light using Polaroid instant film number 57 to generate an image of the gel. Pictures were scanned and the volume of the optical density (OD) of a DNA band was determined by the Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics), and the background was subtracted (so local background was directly proportional to the amount of DNA over a wide range). Intensity (volume of the OD) of the MHC band was divided by the intensity of the control fragment, thereby correcting for any differences in the efficiency of the PCR reactions. The content of each experimental group MHC gene was calculated as a percentage of the MHC value in the control group (Table 2).\n\n\n \nResults:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe masseter muscle dissected from untreated intact female rats was set as the control level (representing 100%) of MHC IIb expression (see histogram in \nFigure 1a\n). Intact female rats treated with androgens were evaluated against the untreated controls for the effect of treatment on MHC llb from masseter. The results indicate that testosterone propionate has a positive effect on masseter muscle where it increased transcription of MCH type llb to 142% of untreated control (\nFigure 1b\n). Compound V was found to have a similar effect where it increased level of MHC llb transript to 124% (\nFigure 1b\n). Actual untransformed data (PCR results) is shown in \nFigure 1a\n.\n\nIn these same rats, the levator ani was dissected and evaluated for the expression pattern of MHC family members. The data indicate that all animals treated with androgens (TP or Compound V) for a period of 14- and 28-days had a muscle present in the location expected for the levator ani, and further characterization of this tissue by RT-PCR demonstrates presence of MHC type llb and very little expression of MHC subtypes IIx and the neonatal isoform. The SDS-PAGE as well as immunoblotting with a MHC type ll specific antibody revealed a single band of apparent molecular weight of about 200 kDa. These results are consistent with the presence of a levator ani muscle [\nTalmadge R. J. and Roy R.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 75(5): 2337-2340, 1993\n].\n\n \nTable 2.

Intact male rats treated with androgens were evaluated against the untreated controls for the effect of treatment on MHC llb from masseter or gastrocnemius. The results indicate that testosterone propionate has a positive effect on masseter muscle where it increased transcription of MHC type llb to 120(±14)% of untreated control (\nFigure 2\n - Top). Compound V was also anabolic in muscle, with an increase in MHC type llb to 117(±13)% (\nFigure 2\n - Top). In gastrocnemius muscle, similar results were observed. Testosterone propionate has a positive effect on gastrocnemius muscle where it increased transcription of MHC type llb to 139(±47)% of untreated control (\nFigure 2\n - Bottom). Compound V was also anabolic in muscle, with an increase in MHC type llb to 162(±54)% (\nFigure 2\n - Bottom).\n\n\n \n\n\nConclusions:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThese results demonstrate that both the selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) as exemplified by compound V and TP have direct anabolic effects on the musculoskeletal system in intact female and male rats as measured bya net increase in the expression of mRNA for MHC. Additionally, treatment with these anabolic agents for a period of 14- and 28-days resulted in muscular hypertrophy of the levator ani. Testosterone has been recognized as an anabolic androgen for several decades. It has been demonstrated herein, that the selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) as exemplified by Compound V is an orally bioavailable nonsteroidal agent with tissue selective anabolic effects in male rats and which increases muscle mass. The selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) as described hereinabove, may be used to treat among other diseases or conditions catabolic syndromes of sarcopenia associated with aging or chronic illness, and sexual dysfunction in females.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacologic Activity and Tissue-Selectivity of Compounds V and VI in Rats of Varying Hormonal Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nPrevious studies by Applicants demonstrated that Compound V is a potent and efficacious selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) in castrated male rats. To provide a representative model of the vast majority of men that will eventually receive this drug, Applicants completed a preclinical study to compare the pharmacologic effects and tissue-selectivity of Compound V, Compound Vl - another potent SARM, and testosterone propionate (TP) in male rats of varying hormonal status. Male rats with normal testicular function (i.e., intact with no surgical manipulation) were included to examine the effects of Compound V on animals with normal blood levels of testosterone. Male rats that received unilateral orchidectomy (i.e., surgical removal of one testis) were included to examine the effects of Compound V on animals with slight androgen depletion. Male rats that received bilateral orchidectomy (i.e., surgical removal of both testes) were included to examine the effects of Compounds V and Vl on androgen-deficient animals.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nMethods:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds V and Vl were synthesized and characterized in the laboratory of Dr. Duane Miller at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan Biosciences (Indianapolis, lN). The animals were maintained on a 12-h cycle of light and dark with food and water available \nad libitum.\n All animal studies were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University, and conformed to the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH publication #85-23, revised 1985). Immature male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 187 to 214 g were randomly distributed into 9 groups of 5 animals. One day before the initiation of drug treatment, groups 4 through 6 and \ngroups\n 7 through 9 received unilateral or bilateral orchidectomy, respectively, via a midline scrotal incision. \nGroups\n 1 through 3 did not undergo surgery. All drugs given to animals were freshly prepared as solutions in polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG 300). \nGroups\n 4 and 7 received treatment with vehicle alone (i.e., PEG 300). Animals in \n \ngroups\n \n 3, 6, and 9 received testosterone propionate (TP, 0.5 mg/day) via implantation of subdermal osmotic pumps (Model 2002, Durect Corporation, Palo Alto, CA). Animals in \n \ngroups\n \n 2, 5, and 8 received Compound V or Compound VI (0.5 mg/day) via implantation of subdermal osmotic pumps. After 14 days of drug treatment, rats were weighed, anesthetized, and sacrificed. The ventral prostates, seminal vesicles, and levator ani muscle were removed and weighed. Osmotic pumps were also removed from animals to check for correct pump operation. The weights of all organs were normalized to body weight, and analyzed for any statistically significant differences between groups using single-factor ANOVA with the alpha value set a \npriori\n at p < 0.05. The weights of prostates and seminal vesicles were used as indices for evaluation of androgenic activity, and the levator ani muscle weight was used to evaluate the anabolic activity. Statistical analyses of parameters from complete blood count or serum chemical profiling, wherever applicable, were performed by single-factor ANOVA with the alpha value set a \npriori\n at p<0.05.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nResults:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAs shown in Table 3 and \nFigure 3\n, in intact animals, Compound V decreased the size of the prostate to 79% and, of that observed in control animals (\nFig 3A\n), with no statistically significant changes in the size of the seminal vesicles (\nFig 3B\n) or levator ani muscle (\nFig 3C\n). The pharmacologic effects and tissue selectivity of Compound V were more obvious in hemi-orchidectomized animals (Table 3 and \nFigure 4\n). Compound V decreased the size of the prostate (\nFig 4A\n) and seminal vesicles (\nFig 4B\n) to 75% and 79%, respectively, and increased the size of the levator ani muscle (\nFig 4C\n) to 108% of that observed in untreated hemi-orchidectomized animals. These observations demonstrate that Compound V acts as a partial agonist in prostate and seminal vesicles and as a full agonist in levator ani muscle. No adverse pharmacologic effects were observed. Similarly, as shown in Table 3 and in \nFigures 5\n and \n6\n, in castrated animals.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTable\n 3. \nComparison of androgenic and anabolic effects of Compound V and TP on intact, hemi-orchidectomized and castrated rats (% of intact control, n=5).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrgans\n\n\nControl\n\n\nCompound V\n\n\nTP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(0.5 mg/day)\n\n\n(0.5 mg/day)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIntact\n\n\n100.00 ± 13.13\n\n\n79.41 ± 9.32*\n†\n \n\n\n97.45 ± 10.82\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProstate\n\n\nHemi-\n\n\n86.42 ± 19.52\n\n\n74.69 ± 8.44*\n†\n \n\n\n98.57 ± 7.98\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCastrated\n\n\n7.19 ± 1.25\n\n\n32.55 ± 11.65*\n†‡\n \n\n\n76.78 ± 10.43*\n‡\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeminal\n\n\nIntact\n\n\n100.00 ± 18.84\n\n\n90.54 ± 12.10\n\n\n103.95 ± 13.23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVesicle\n\n\nHemi-\n\n\n102.93 ± 7.47\n\n\n78.55 ± 13.58\n†‡\n \n\n\n114.19 ± 23.81\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCastrated\n\n\n8.97 ± 1.23\n\n\n16.47 ± 5.21*\n†‡\n \n\n\n63.48 ± 17.05*\n‡\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIntact\n\n\n100.00 ± 12.69\n\n\n109.15 ± 14.68\n\n\n95.61 ± 9.34\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevator Ani\n\n\nHemi-\n\n\n92.94 ± 7.83\n\n\n108.10 ± 8.92\n‡\n \n\n\n98.63 ± 10.47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCastrated\n\n\n42.74 ± 5.22\n\n\n100.65 ± 10.86\n‡\n \n\n\n87.27 ± 10.25\n‡\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* p<0.05 compared to intact control group.\n\n\n†\n p<0.05 compared to TP of same surgical status (i.e., intact, hemi-orchidectomized, or castrate).\n\n\n‡\n p<0.05 compared to control group of same surgical status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA comparison of the androgenic and anabolic activities of Compound V and Compound VI is provided in Table 4.\n\n \n \nTable 4:\n \n \n \n \n \nTable 4 Comparison of Androgenic and Anabolic Activities of compounds VI and V TO TP\n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrgans\n \nTreatment\n \nE\nmax\n \n\n(% of Intact Control)\n \nRelative\n\nAfficacy\n \nED\n50\n \n\n(mg/day)\n \nRelative\n\nPotency\n \n \n \n \nAndrogenic\n \n \n \nTP\n \n120.6 ± 13.4\n \n1.00\n \n0.13 ± 0.03\n \n1.00\n \n \n \nProstate\n \nVI\n \n14.5 ± 0.7\n \n0.12\n \n0.42 ± 0.04\n \n0.31\n \n \n \n \n \nV\n \n35.2 ± 0.4\n \n0.29\n \n0.43 ± 0.01\n \n0.30\n \n \n \nSeminal\n \nTP\n \n70.0 ±18.8\n \n1.00\n \n0.12 ± 0.02\n \n1.00\n \n \n \nVesicle\n \nVI\n \n12.7 ± 3.1\n \n0.18\n \n0.38 ± 0.26\n \n0.32\n \n \n \n \n \nV\n \n28.5 ± 0.8\n \n0.40\n \n0.55 ± 0.02\n \n0.22\n \n \n \nAnabolic\n \nLevator\n \nTP\n \n104.2 ± 10.1\n \n1.00\n \n0.15 ± 0.03\n \n1.00\n \n \n \nAni\n \nVI\n \n74.9 ± 0.4\n \n0.72\n \n0.44 ± 0.01\n \n0.34\n \n \n \nMuscle\n \nV\n \n101.0 ± 1.0\n \n0.97\n \n0.14 ± 0.01\n \n1.07\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nConclusions:\n\n\n \n \n \nCompound V demonstrated potent and tissue-selective pharmacologic effects in intact, hemi-orchidectomized and castrated male rats. Compound V led to significant decreases in prostate weights in intact and hemi-orchidectomized animals, and was less effective than TP at increasing the weight of the prostate in castrated animals. Similar pharmacologic effects were noted in the seminal vesicles (another organ generally considered as a marker of androgenic effects), with the exception that Compound V had no effect on the weight of the seminal vesicles in intact animals. Compound V treatment led to significant increases in the weight of the levator ani muscle in hemi-orchidectomized and castrated animals. These effects were greater than those observed with TP. These data demonstrate the tissue-selective pharmacologic effects of Compound V. It is important to note that these effects were observed in the absence of any significant changes in plasma concentrations of FSH, LH and testosterone (not shown). In summary, these data show that Compound V elicits an optimal pharmacological profile in male animals, identifying it as the first member of a new class of orally bioavailable and tissue-selective SARMs.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacologic Activity and Tissue-Selectivity of selected halogenated Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators in Rats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds VI-X in Table 5 were synthesized and characterized in the laboratory of Dr. Duane Miller at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tissue-selectivity and pharmacologic effects of Compounds VI-X were determined as described above in Example 2.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 5 shows the chemical structures and binding affinities of Compounds VI-IX.

Compounds VI-IX all had an anabolic effect, increasing the weight of the levator ani muscle in a dose-dependent manner. Compounds VI, VIII I arid IX (\nFigures 7A, C and D\n, respectivetly) increased the weight of the levator ani muscle to values close to those of the intact controls. The effect of compound VII (\nFigure 7B\n) was even more pronounced ― increasing the weight of the levator ani muscle to values exceeding those of intact controls. There were no statistically significant changes in the sizes of the prostate or seminal vesicles. These data demonstrate the tissue-selective pharmacologic effects of Compounds VI-IX.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPharmacologic Activity and Tissue-Selectivity of Compound X in Rats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompound X (Table 6) was synthesized and characterized in the laboratory of Dr. Duane Miller at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe tissue-selectivity and pharmacologic effects of Compound X were determined as described above in Examples 2 and 3.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTable 6 shows the chemical structure and binding affinity of Compound X.
