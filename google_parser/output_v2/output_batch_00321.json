The disclosure of each prior application is considered part of and is incorporated by reference in the disclosure of this application.\n\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention relates to methods of treatment of certain metabolic diseases and the use of compounds and their prodrugs, and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds useful in treating such diseases. In particular, the invention relates to the use of compounds and compositions for the prophylaxis, management or treatment of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, and obesity through the inhibition of malonyl-coenzyme A decarboxylase (malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, MCD).\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nMalonyl-CoA is an important metabolic intermediary produced by the enzyme Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC) in the body. In the liver, adipocytes, and other tissues, malonyl-CoA is a substrate for fatty acid synthase (FAS). ACC and malonyl-CoA are found in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle tissue, where fatty acid synthase levels are low. The enzyme malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD, EC 4.1.1.9) catalyzes the conversion of malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and thereby regulates malonyl-CoA levels. MCD activity has been described in a wide array of organisms, including prokaryotes, birds, and mammals. It has been purified from the bacteria \nRhizobium trifolii \n(An et al., \nJ. Biochem. Mol. Biol. \n32:414-418 (1999)), the uropygial glands of waterfowl (Buckner, et al., \nArch. Biochem. Biophys \n177:539 (1976); Kim and Kolattukudy \nArch. Biochem. Biophys \n190:585 (1978)), rat liver mitochondria (Kim and Kolattukudy, \nArch. Biochem. Biophys. \n190:234 (1978)), rat mammary glands (Kim and Kolattukudy, \nBiochim. Biophys, Acta \n531:187 (1978)), rat pancreatic β-cell (Voilley et al., \nBiochem. J. \n340:213 (1999)) and goose (\nAnser anser\n) (Jang et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n264:3500 (1989)). Identification of patients with MCD deficiency lead to the cloning of a human gene homologous to goose and rat MCD genes (Gao et al., \nJ. Lipid. Res. \n40:178 (1999); Sacksteder et al., \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n274:24461 (1999); FitzPatrick et al., \nAm. J. Hum. Genet. \n65:318 (1999)). A single human MCD mRNA is observed by Northern Blot analysis. The highest mRNA expression levels are found in muscle and heart tissues, followed by liver, kidney and pancreas, with detectable amounts in all other tissues examined.\n\n\nMalonyl-CoA is a potent endogenous inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I), an enzyme essential for the metabolism of long-chain fatty acids. CPT-I is the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid oxidation and catalyzes the formation of acyl-carnitine, which is transported from the cytosol across the mitochondrial membranes by acyl carnitine translocase. Inside of the mitochondria the long-chain fatty acids are transferred back to CoA form by a complementary enzyme, CPT-II, and, in the mitochondria, acyl-CoA enters the β-oxidation pathway generating acetyl-CoA. In the liver, high levels of acetyl-CoA occurs for example following a meal, leading to elevated malonyl-CoA levels, which inhibit CPT-I, thereby preventing fat metabolism and favoring fat synthesis. Conversely, low malonyl-CoA levels favor fatty acid metabolism by allowing the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria. Hence, malonyl-CoA is a central metabolite that plays a key role in balancing fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation (Zammit, \nBiochem. J. \n343:5050-515 (1999)). Recent work indicates that MCD is able to regulate cytoplasmic as well as mitochondrial malonyl-CoA levels [Alam and Saggerson, \nBiochem J. \n334:233-241 (1998); Dyck et al., \nAm J Physiology \n275:H2122-2129 (1998)].\n\n\nAlthough malonyl-CoA is present in muscle and cardiac tissues, only low levels of FAS have been detected in these tissues. It is believed that the role of malonyl-CoA and MCD in these tissues is to regulate fatty acid metabolism. This is achieved via malonyl-CoA inhibition of muscle (M) and liver (L) isoforms of CPT-I, which are encoded by distinct genes (McGarry and Brown, \nEur. J. Biochem. \n244:1-14 (1997)). The muscle isoform is more sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition (IC\n50 \n0.03 μM) than the liver isoform (IC\n50 \n2.5 μM). Malonyl-CoA regulation of CPT-I has been described in the liver, heart, skeletal muscle and pancreatic β-cells. In addition, malonyl-CoA sensitive acyl-CoA transferase activity present in microsomes, perhaps part of a system that delivers acyl groups into the endoplasmic reticulum, has also been described (Fraser et al., \nFEBS Lett. \n446: 69-74 (1999)).\n\n\nCardiovascular Diseases: The healthy human heart utilizes available metabolic substrates. When blood glucose levels are high, uptake and metabolism of glucose provide the major source of fuel for the heart. In the fasting state, lipids are provided by adipose tissues, and fatty acid uptake and metabolism in the heart down regulate glucose metabolism. The regulation of intermediary metabolism by serum levels of fatty acid and glucose comprises the glucose-fatty acid cycle (Randle et al., \nLancet, \n1:785-789 (1963)). Under ischemic conditions, limited oxygen supply reduces both fatty acid and glucose oxidation and reduces the amount of ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation in the cardiac tissues. In the absence of sufficient oxygen, glycolysis increases in an attempt to maintain ATP levels and a buildup of lactate and a drop in intracellular pH results. Energy is spent maintaining ion homeostasis, and myocyte cell death occurs as a result of abnormally low ATP levels and disrupted cellular osmolarity. Additionally, AMPK, activated during ischemia, phosphorylates and thus inactivates ACC. Total cardiac malonyl-CoA levels drop, CPT-I activity therefore is increased and fatty acid oxidation is favored over glucose oxidation. The beneficial effects of metabolic modulators in cardiac tissue are the increased efficiency of ATP/mole oxygen for glucose as compared to fatty acids and more importantly the increased coupling of glycolysis to glucose oxidation resulting in the net reduction of the proton burden in the ischemic tissue.\n\n\nA number of clinical and experimental studies indicate that shifting energy metabolism in the heart towards glucose oxidation is an effective approach to decreasing the symptoms associated with cardiovascular diseases, such as but not limited, to myocardial ischemia (Hearse, “\nMetabolic approaches to ischemic heart disease and its management\n”, Science Press). Several clinically proven anti-angina drugs including perhexyline and amiodarone inhibit fatty acid oxidation via inhibition of CPT-I (Kennedy et al., \nBiochem. Pharmacology, \n52: 273 (1996)). The antianginal drugs ranolazine, currently in Phase III clinical trials, and trimetazidine are shown to inhibit fatty acid β-oxidation (McCormack et al., \nGenet. Pharmac. \n30:639 (1998), Pepine et al., \nAm. J. Cardiology \n84:46 (1999)). Trimetazidine has been shown to specifically inhibit the long-chain 3-ketoactyl CoA thiolase, an essential step in fatty acid oxidation. (Kantor et al., \nCirc. Res. \n86:580-588 (2000)). Dichloroacetate increases glucose oxidation by stimulating the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and improves cardiac function in those patients with coronary artery diseases (Wargovich et al., \nAm. J. Cardiol. \n61:65-70 (1996)). Inhibiting CPT-I activity through the increased malonyl-CoA levels with MCD inhibitors would result in not only a novel, but also a much safer method, as compared to other known small molecule CPT-I inhibitors, to the prophylaxis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.\n\n\nMost of the steps involved in glycerol-lipid synthesis occur on the cytosolic side of liver endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The synthesis of triacyl glycerol (TAG) targeted for secretion inside the ER from diacyl glycerol (DAG) and acyl CoA is dependent upon acyl CoA transport across the ER membrane. This transport is dependent upon a malonyl-CoA sensitive acyl-CoA transferase activity (Zammit, \nBiochem. J. \n343: 505 (1999) Abo-Hashema, \nBiochem. \n38: 15840 (1999) and Abo-Hashema, \nJ. Biol. Chem. \n274:35577 (1999)). Inhibition of TAG biosynthesis by a MCD inhibitor may improve the blood lipid profile and therefore reduce the risk factor for coronary artery disease of patients.\n\n\nDiabetes: Two metabolic complications most commonly associated with diabetes are hepatic overproduction of ketone bodies (in NIDDM) and organ toxicity associated with sustained elevated levels of glucose. Inhibition of fatty acid oxidation can regulate blood-glucose levels and ameliorate some symptoms of type II diabetes. Malonyl-CoA inhibition of CPT-I is the most important regulatory mechanism that controls the rate of fatty acid oxidation during the onset of the hypoinsulinemic-hyperglucagonemic state. Several irreversible and reversible CPT-I inhibitors have been evaluated for their ability to control blood glucose levels and they are all invariably hypoglycemic (Anderson, \nCurrent Pharmaceutical Design \n4:1 (1998)). A liver specific and reversible CPT-inhibitor, SDZ-CPI-975, significantly lowers glucose levels in normal 18-hour-fasted nonhuman primates and rats without inducing cardiac hypertrophy (Deems et al., \nAm. J. Physiology \n274:R524 (1998)). Malonyl-CoA plays a significant role as a sensor of the relative availability of glucose and fatty acid in pancreatic β-cells, and thus links glucose metabolism to cellular energy status and insulin secretion. It has been shown that insulin secretagogues elevate malonyl-CoA concentration in β-cells (Prentki et al., \nDiabetes \n45: 273 (1996)). Treating diabetes directly with CPT-I inhibitors has, however, resulted in mechanism-based hepatic and myocardial toxicities. MCD inhibitors that inhibit CPT-I through the increase of its endogenous inhibitor, malonyl-CoA, are thus safer and superior as compared to CPT-I inhibitors for treatment of diabetic diseases.\n\n\nCancers: Malonyl-CoA has been suggested to be a potential mediator of cytotoxicity induced by fatty-acid synthase inhibition in human breast cancer cells and xenografts (Pizer et al., \nCancer Res. \n60:213 (2000)). It is found that inhibition of fatty acid synthase using antitumor antibiotic cerulenin or a synthetic analog C75 markedly increase the malonyl-CoA levels in breast carcinoma cells. On the other hand, the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor, TOFA (5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid), which only inhibits at the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) level, does not show any antitumor activity, while at the same time the malonyl-CoA level is decreased to 60% of the control. It is believed that the increased malonyl-CoA level is responsible for the antitumor activity of these fatty acid synthase inhibitors. Regulating malonyl-CoA levels using MCD inhibitors thus constitutes a valuable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancer diseases.\n\n\nObesity: It is suggested that malonyl-CoA may play a key role in appetite signaling in the brain via the inhibition of the neuropeptide Y pathway (Loftus et al., \nScience \n288: 2379 (2000)). Systemic or intracerebroventricular treatment of mice with fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitor cerulenin or C75 led to inhibition of feeding and dramatic weight loss. It is found that C75 inhibited expression of the prophagic signal neuropeptide Y in the hypothalamus and acted in a leptin-independent manner that appears to be mediated by malonyl-CoA. Therefore control of malonyl-CoA levels through inhibition of MCD provides a novel approach to the prophylaxis and treatment of obesity.\n\n\nWe have now found a novel use for compounds containing thiazoles and oxazoles, members of which are potent inhibitors of MCD. The compounds tested both in vitro and in vivo inhibit malonyl-CoA decarboxylase activities and increase the malonyl-CoA concentration in the animal tissues. In addition, by way of example, selected compounds induce a significant increase in glucose oxidation as compared with the control in an isolated perfused rat heart assay (McNeill, \nMeasurement of Cardiovascular Function\n, CRC Press, 1997). Advantageously, preferred compounds embodied in this application have more profound effects in metabolism shift than the known metabolism modulators such as ranolazine or trimetazidine. The compounds useful for this invention and pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds are therefore useful in medicine, especially in the prophylaxis, management and treatment of various cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers and obesity.\n\n\nAdditionally, these compounds are also useful as a diagnostic tool for diseases associated with MCD deficiency or malfunctions.\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention provides methods for the use of compounds as depicted by structure I, pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, and methods for the prophylaxis, management and treatment of metabolic diseases and diseases modulated by MCD inhibition. The compounds disclosed in this invention are useful for the prophylaxis, management and treatment of diseases involving in malonyl-CoA regulated glucose/fatty acid metabolism pathway. In particular, these compounds and pharmaceutical composition containing the same are indicated in the prophylaxis, management and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and obesity.\n\n\nThe present invention also includes within its scope diagnostic methods for the detection of diseases associated with MCD deficiency or malfunctions.\n\n\nThe compounds useful in the present invention are represented by the following structure (1):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nWherein R\n1\n, R\n2\n, R\n3\n, X and Y are as defined below. Also included within the scope of these compounds are the corresponding enantiomers, diastereoisomers, prodrugs, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Other aspects of this invention will become apparent as the description of this invention continues. Hence, the foregoing merely summarizes certain aspects of the invention and is not intended, nor should it be construed, as limiting the invention in any way.\n\n\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe detailed description of the invention that follows is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise details disclosed. It has been chosen and described to best explain the details of the invention to others skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe compounds useful in the present invention are represented by the following formulae (I):\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein\n\n\nR\n1 \nand R\n2 \nare independently selected from hydrogen, hydroxyl, alkoxyl, phenoxyl, substituted phenoxyl, substituted C\n1\n-C\n12 \nalkyl, substituted C\n1\n-C\n12 \nalkenyl, substituted C\n2\n-C\n12 \nalkynyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl, aryl, or heteroaryl, or R\n1 \nand R\n2 \ntogether form a 5 to 7 membered ring with each other;\n\n\nR\n3 \nis selected from hydrogen, C\n1\n-C\n12 \nalkyl, substituted C\n1\n-C\n12 \nalkyl, phenyl, substituted phenyl, aryl or heteroaryl;\n\n\nX is C or N;\n\n\nY is S or O;\n\n\nits corresponding enantiomers, diastereoisomers or tautomers, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or a prodrug thereof in an pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier.\n\n\nPreferably, the compounds in the present invention are represented by the following formula (Ia and Ib):\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1\n, R\n3\n, X and Y are as defined above.\n\n\nMore preferably, the compounds in the present invention are represented by the following formula (Ic and Id):\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R\n1 \nand R\n3 \nare as defined above.\n\n\nCompositions\n\n\nThe compositions of the present invention comprise:\n\n \n \n(a) a safe and therapeutically effective amount of an MCD inhibiting compound I or II, its corresponding enantiomer, diastereoisomer or tautomer, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or a prodrug thereof; and\n \n(b) a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier.\n \n\n\nAs discussed above, numerous diseases can be mediated by MCD related therapy.\n\n\nAccordingly, the compounds useful in this invention can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions for use in prophylaxis, management and treatment of these conditions. Standard pharmaceutical formulation techniques are used, such as those disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa.\n\n\nA “safe and therapeutically effective amount” of a compound useful in the present invention is an amount that is effective, to inhibit MCD at the site(s) of activity, in a subject, a tissue, or a cell, and preferably in an animal, more preferably in a mammal, without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, or allergic response), commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, when used in the manner of this invention. The specific “safe and therapeutically effective amount” will, obviously, vary with such factors as the particular condition being treated, the physical condition of the patient, the duration of treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy (if any), the specific dosage form to be used, the carrier employed, the solubility of the compound therein, and the dosage regimen desired for the composition.\n\n\nIn addition to the selected compound useful for the present invention, the compositions of the present invention contain a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. The term “pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier”, as used herein, means one or more compatible solid or liquid filler diluents or encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration to a mammal. The term “compatible”, as used herein, means that the components of the composition are capable of being comingled with the subject compound, and with each other, in a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially reduce the pharmaceutical efficacy of the composition under ordinary use situations. Pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers must, of course, be of sufficiently high purity and sufficiently low toxicity to render them suitable for administration preferably to an animal, preferably mammal being treated.\n\n\nSome examples of substances, which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers or components thereof, are sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, and methyl cellulose; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; solid lubricants, such as stearic acid and magnesium stearate; calcium sulfate; vegetable oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and oil of theobroma; polyols such as propylene glycol, glycerine, sorbitol, mannitol, and polyethylene glycol; alginic acid; emulsifiers, such as the TWEENS; wetting agents, such sodium lauryl sulfate; coloring agents; flavoring agents; tableting agents, stabilizers; antioxidants; preservatives; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; and phosphate buffer solutions.\n\n\nThe choice of a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier to be used in conjunction with the subject compound is basically determined by the way the compound is to be administered.\n\n\nIf the subject compound is to be injected, the preferred pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier is sterile, physiological saline, with blood-compatible suspending agent, the pH of which has been adjusted to about 7.4. In particular, pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers for systemic administration include sugars, starches, cellulose and its derivatives, malt, gelatin, talc, calcium sulfate, vegetable oils, synthetic oils, polyols, alginic acid, phosphate buffer solutions, emulsifiers, isotonic saline, and pyrogen-free water. Preferred carriers for parenteral administration include propylene glycol, ethyl oleate, pyrrolidone, ethanol, and sesame oil. Preferably, the pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, in compositions for parenteral administration, comprises at least about 90% by weight of the total composition.\n\n\nThe compositions of this invention are preferably provided in unit dosage form. As used herein, a “unit dosage form” is a composition of this invention containing an amount of a compound that is suitable for administration to an animal, preferably mammal subject, in a single dose, according to good medical practice. (The preparation of a single or unit dosage form however, does not imply that the dosage form is administered once per day or once per course of therapy. Such dosage forms are contemplated to be administered once, twice, thrice or more per day, and are expected to be given more than once during a course of therapy, though a single administration is not specifically excluded. The skilled artisan will recognize that the formulation does not specifically contemplate the entire course of therapy and such decisions are left for those skilled in the art of treatment rather than formulation.) These compositions preferably contain from about 5 mg (milligrams), more preferably from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg, more preferably to about 500 mg, most preferably to about 300 mg, of the selected compound.\n\n\nThe compositions useful for this invention may be in any of a variety of forms, suitable (for example) for oral, nasal, rectal, topical (including transdermal), ocular, intracerebrally, intravenous, intramuscular, or parenteral administration. (The skilled artisan will appreciate that oral and nasal compositions comprise compositions that are administered by inhalation, and made using available methodologies.) Depending upon the particular route of administration desired, a variety of pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers well-known in the art may be used. These include solid or liquid fillers, diluents, hydrotropes, surface-active agents, and encapsulating substances. Optional pharmaceutically-active materials may be included, which do not substantially interfere with the inhibitory activity of the compound. The amount of carrier employed in conjunction with the compound is sufficient to provide a practical quantity of material for administration per unit dose of the compound. Techniques and compositions for making dosage forms useful in the methods of this invention are described in the following references, all incorporated by reference herein: Modern Pharmaceutics, Chapters 9 and 10 (Banker & Rhodes, editors, 1979); Lieberman et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets (1981); and Ansel, Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms 2d Edition (1976).\n\n\nVarious oral dosage forms can be used, including such solid forms as tablets, capsules, granules and bulk powders. These oral forms comprise a safe and effective amount, usually at least about 5%, and preferably from about 25% to about 50%, of the compound.

Glidants such as silicon dioxide can be used to improve flow characteristics of the powder mixture. Coloring agents, such as the FD&C dyes, can be added for appearance. Sweeteners and flavoring agents, such as aspartame, saccharin, menthol, peppermint, and fruit flavors, are useful adjuvants for chewable tablets. Capsules typically comprise one or more solid diluents disclosed above. The selection of carrier components depends on secondary considerations like taste, cost, and shelf stability, which are not critical for the purposes of the subject invention, and can be readily made by a person skilled in the art.\n\n\nPeroral compositions also include liquid solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and the like. The pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers suitable for preparation of such compositions are well known in the art.

Such compositions include, for example, lotions, creams, solutions, gels and solids. These topical compositions preferably comprise a safe and effective amount, usually at least about 0.1%, and preferably from about 1% to about 5%, of the compound. Suitable carriers for topical administration preferably remain in place on the skin as a continuous film, and resist being removed by perspiration or immersion in water. Generally, the carrier is organic in nature and capable of having dispersed or dissolved therein the compound. The carrier may include pharmaceutically-acceptable emollient, emulsifiers, thickening agents, solvents and the like.\n\n\nMethods of Administration\n\n\nThe compounds and compositions useful in this invention can be administered topically or systemically.

It is understood that these dosage ranges are by way of example only, and that daily administration can be adjusted depending on the factors listed above.\n\n\nIn all of the foregoing, of course, the compounds useful in the present invention can be administered alone or as mixtures, and the compositions may further include additional drugs or excipients as appropriate for the indication. For example, in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, it is clearly contemplated that the invention may be used in conjunction with beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, angiotensin receptor inhibitors, or known cardiovascular drugs or therapies. Hence, in this example, compounds or compositions useful in this invention are useful when dosed together with another active and can be combined in a single dosage form or composition.\n\n\nThese compositions can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, or phosphatidylcholines.\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n\nAs used herein, “alkyl” means a straight chain alkane, alkene, or alkyne substituent containing only carbon and hydrogen, such as methyl, ethyl, butyl, pentyl, heptyl and the like.

When a specific degree of unsaturation is preferred, said substituent is referred to as either “alkenyl” or “alkynyl”, denoting substituents containing —C═C— or —C≡C— linkages, respectively. The number of carbons may be denoted as “C\ni\n-C\nj\n-alkyl” wherein I and j refer to the minimum and maximum number of carbon atoms, respectively. Typically, alkyl groups will comprise 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 10, and more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms.\n\n\nAs used herein, “substituted alkyl” means a hydrocarbon substituent, which is linear, cyclic or branched, in which one or more hydrogen atoms are substituted by carboxy, hydroxy, alkoxy, cyano, nitro, carbonyl, aryl, carboxyalkyl, mercapto, amino, amido, ureido, carbamoyl, sulfonamido, sulfamido, or halogen. Preferred substituted alkyls have their alkyl spacers (i.e., portion which is alkyl) of 1 to about 5 carbons, and may be branched or linear, and may include cyclic substituents, either as part or all of their structure. Preferred examples of “substituted alkyls” include 4-carboxybutyl, pyridin-2-ylmethyl, and 1,3-thiazol-2-ylmethyl, benzyl, phenethyl, and trifluoromethyl. The term “substituted alkyl” may be combined with other art accepted terms. For example “substituted alkoxy” means alkoxy as understood in the art, wherein the alkyl portion of the substituent is substituted.\n\n\nAs used herein, “branched alkyl” means a subset of “alkyl”, and thus is a hydrocarbon substituent, which is branched. Preferred branched alkyls are of 3 to about 12 carbons, and may include cycloalkyl within their structure. Examples of branched alkyl include isopropyl, isobutyl, 1,2-dimethyl-propyl, cyclopentylmethyl and the like. The term “branched alkyl” may be combined with other art accepted terms. For example “branched alkoxy” means alkoxy as understood in the art, wherein the alkyl portion of the substituent is branched.\n\n\nAs used herein, “cycloalkyl” is a hydrocarbon substituent that is cyclic, and can be substituted or unsubstituted.

Hence “(alkylene)R\ni\n” is an alkyl diradical attached at one carbon and having substituent R\ni \nattached at another carbon, which may be one or more carbons away from the point of attachment. Alkylene can be linear, branched, or cyclic. Examples of alkylene include —CH\n2\n—, CH\n2\nCH\n2\n—, —(CH\n2\n)\n4\n—, -(cyclohexyl)-, and the like.\n\n\nAs used herein, “aryl” is a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic, i.e., Hückel 4n+2 rule applies, radical having a single-ring (e.g., phenyl) or multiple condensed rings (e.g., naphthyl or anthryl), which may contain zero to 4 heteroatoms. Hence the term “heteroaryl” is clearly contemplated in the term “aryl”. Preferred carbocyclic aryl, is phenyl. Preferred monocyclic heterocycles, i.e., heteroaryls, are 5 or 6 membered rings. Preferably, where the term “aryl” represents an aromatic heterocycle, it is referred to as “heteroaryl” or “heteroaromatic”, and has one or more heteroatom(s). Preferred numbers of such heteroatoms are from one to three N atoms, and preferably when “heteroaryl” is a heterocycle of five members, it has one or two heteroatoms selected from O, N, or S. Hence, preferred heterocycles have up to three, more preferably two or less, heteroatoms present in the aromatic ring. The skilled artisan will recognize that among heteroaryl, there are both five and six membered rings. Examples of “heteroaryl” include; thienyl, pyridyl, pyrimidyl, pyridazyl, furyl, oxazolyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, triazinyl, triazolyl, thiadiazolyl, and others, which the skilled artisan will recognize. In this definition it is clearly contemplated that substitution on the aryl ring is within the scope of this invention. Where substitution occurs, the radical is referred to as “substituted aryl”. Preferably one to three, more preferably one or two, and most preferably one substituent is attached to the aryl ring. Although many substituents will be useful, preferred substituents include those commonly found in aryl compounds, such as alkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, cyano, nitro, halo, haloalkyl, mercapto and the like. Such substituents are prepared using known methodologies. These substituents may be attached at various positions of the aryl ring, and wherein a given placement is preferred, such placement is indicated by “o,m,p-R\ni\n-aryl”. Thus, if substituent R\ni \nis attached at the para position of the aryl, then this is indicated as “p-R\ni\n-substituted aryl”.\n\n\nAs used herein, “amide” includes both RNR′CO— (in the case of R=alkyl, alkaminocarbonyl-) and RCONR′— (in the case of R=alkyl, alkyl carbonylamino-).\n\n\nAs used herein, “ester” includes both ROCO— (in the case of R=alkyl, alkoxycarbonyl-) and RCOO— (in the case of R=alkyl, alkylcarbonyloxy-).\n\n\nAs used herein, “halogen” is a chloro, bromo, fluoro or iodo atom radical.

These may be substituted or unsubstituted, and are attached to other parts of the molecule via any available valence, preferably any available carbon or nitrogen. More preferred heterocycles are of 5 or 6 members. In six-membered monocyclic heterocycles, the heteroatom(s) are from one to three of O, S, or N, and wherein when the heterocycle is five-membered, preferably it has one or two heteroatoms selected from O, N, or S.\n\n\nAs used herein, “heterocyclyl” means radical heterocycles.

When such radicals are combined, the skilled artisan will understand that there are no unsatisfied valences in such a case, but that specific substitutions, for example a bond for a hydrogen, is made. Hence certain radicals can be described as forming rings together. The skilled artisan will recognize that such rings can and are readily formed by routine chemical reactions, and it is within the purview of the skilled artisan to both envision such rings and the methods of their formations. Preferred are rings having from 3-7 members, more preferably 5 or 6 members. Compounds described herein may have cyclic structures therein, such as a ring R\n1 \nand R\n2\n. In that regard the skilled artisan recognizes that this method of description is routine in medicinal chemistry, though such may not rigorously reflect the chemical synthetic route. As used herein the term “ring” or “rings” when formed by the combination of two radicals refers to heterocyclic or carbocyclic radicals, and such radicals may be saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic. For example, preferred heterocyclic ring systems include heterocyclic rings, such as morpholinyl, piperidinyl, imidazolyl, pyrrolidinyl, and pyridyl.\n\n\nThe skilled artisan will recognize that the radical of formula:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nrepresents a number of different functionalities. Preferred functionalities represented by this structure include amides, ureas, thioureas, carbamates, esters, thioesters, amidines, ketones, oximes, nitroolefines, hydroxyguanidines and guanidines.

The artisan recognizes that such structures are clearly contemplated within the scope of this invention, although such resonance forms or tautomers are not represented herein. For example, the structures:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nclearly represent the same compound(s), and reference to either clearly contemplates the other. In addition, the compounds useful in this invention can be provided as prodrugs, the following of which serve as examples:\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nwherein R is a group (or linkage) removed by biological processes. Hence, clearly contemplated in this invention is the use compounds provided as biohydrolyzable prodrugs, as they are understood in the art. “Prodrug”, as used herein is any compound wherein when it is exposed to the biological processes in an organism, is hydrolyzed, metabolized, derivatized or the like, to yield an active substance having the desired activity. The skilled artisan will recognize that prodrugs may or may not have any activity as prodrugs. It is the intent that the prodrugs described herein have no deleterious effect on the subject to be treated when dosed in safe and effective amounts. These include for example, biohydrolyzable amides and esters. A “biohydrolyzable amide” is an amide compound which does not essentially interfere with the activity of the compound, or that is readily converted in vivo by a cell, tissue, or human, mammal, or animal subject to yield an active compound. A “biohydrolyzable ester” refers to an ester compound that does not interfere with the activity of these compounds or that is readily converted by an animal to yield an active compound. Such biohydrolyzable prodrugs are understood by the skilled artisan and are embodied in regulatory guidelines.\n\n\n\nCompounds and compositions herein also specifically contemplate pharmaceutically acceptable salts, whether cationic or anionic. A “pharmaceutically-acceptable salt” is an anionic salt formed at any acidic (e.g., carboxyl) group, or a cationic salt formed at any basic (e.g., amino) group. Many such salts are known in the art, as described in World Patent Publication 87/05297, Johnston et al., published Sep. 11, 1987 (incorporated by reference herein). Preferred counter-ions of salts formable at acidic groups can include cations of salts, such as the alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium), and alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium) and organic salts. Preferred salts formable at basic sites include anions such as the halides (such as chloride salts). Of course, the skilled artisan is aware that a great number and variation of salts may be used, and examples exist in the literature of either organic or inorganic salts useful in this manner.\n\n\nInasmuch as the compounds useful in this invention may contain one or more stereogenic centers, “Optical isomer”, “stereoisomer”, “enantiomer,” “diastereomer,” as referred to herein have the standard art recognized meanings (cf. \nHawleys Condensed Chemical Dictionary, \n11th Ed.) and are included in these compounds, whether as racemates, or their optical isomers, stereoisomers, enantiomers, and diastereomers.\n\n\nAs used herein, the term “metabolic disease”, means a group of identified disorders in which errors of metabolism, imbalances in metabolism, or sub-optimal metabolism occur. The metabolic diseases as used herein also contemplate a disease that can be treated through the modulation of metabolism, although the disease itself may or may not be caused by specific metabolism blockage. Preferably, such metabolic disease involves glucose and fatty acid oxidation pathway. More preferably, such metabolic disease involves MCD or is modulated by levels of Malonyl CoA, and is referred to herein as an “MCD or MCA related disorder.”\n\n\nPreparation of Compounds Useful in this Invention\n\n\nThe starting materials used in preparing the compounds useful in this invention are known, made by known methods, or are commercially available. It will be apparent to the skilled artisan that methods for preparing precursors and functionality related to the compounds claimed herein are generally described in the literature. The skilled artisan given the literature and this disclosure is well equipped to prepare any of these compounds.\n\n\nIt is recognized that the skilled artisan in the art of organic chemistry can readily carry out manipulations without further direction, that is, it is well within the scope and practice of the skilled artisan to carry out these manipulations. These include reduction of carbonyl compounds to their corresponding alcohols, reductive alkylation of amines, oxidations, acylations, aromatic substitutions, both electrophilic and nucleophilic, etherifications, esterification, saponification and the like. These manipulations are discussed in standard texts such as March Advanced Organic Chemistry (Wiley), Carey and Sundberg, \nAdvanced Organic Chemistry \nand the like.\n\n\nThe skilled artisan will readily appreciate that certain reactions are best carried out when other functionality is masked or protected in the molecule, thus avoiding any undesirable side reactions and/or increasing the yield of the reaction. Often the skilled artisan utilizes protecting groups to accomplish such increased yields or to avoid the undesired reactions. These reactions are found in the literature and are also well within the scope of the skilled artisan. Examples of many of these manipulations can be found for example in T. Greene and P. Wuts \nProtecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, \n2\nnd \nEd., John Wiley & Sons (1991).\n\n\nThe following example schemes are provided for the guidance of the reader, and represent preferred methods for making the compounds exemplified herein. These methods are not limiting, and it will be apparent that other routes may be employed to prepare these compounds. Such methods specifically include solid phase based chemistries, including combinatorial chemistry. The skilled artisan is thoroughly equipped to prepare these compounds by those methods given the literature and this disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIn Vitro MCD Inhibitory Assay:\n\n\n\nThe conversion of acetyl-CoA from malonyl-CoA was assayed using a modified protocol as previously described by Kim, Y. S, and Kolattukudy, P. E. in 1978 (\nArch. Biochem. Biophys \n190:585 (1978)). As shown in eq. 1-3, the establishment of the kinetic equilibrium between malate/NAD and oxaloacetate/NADH was catalyzed by malic dehydrogenase (eq. 2). The enzymatic reaction product of MCD, acetyl-CoA, shifted the equilibrium by condensing with oxaloacetate in the presence of citrate synthase (eq. 3), which resulted in a continuous generation of NADH from NAD. The accumulation of NADH can be continuously followed by monitoring the increase of fluorescence emission at 460 nm on a fluorescence plate reader. The fluorescence plate reader was calibrated using the authentic acetyl-CoA from Sigma. For a typical 96-well plate assay, the increase in the fluorescence emission (λ\nex\n=360 nm, λ\nem\n=460 nm, for NADH) in each well was used to calculate the initial velocity of hMCD. Each 50 μL assay contained 10 mM phosphate buffered saline (Sigma), pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween-20, 25 mM K\n2\nHPO\n4\n—KH\n2\nPO\n4 \n(Sigma), 2 mM Malate (Sigma), 2 mM NAD (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.786 units of MD (Roche Chemicals), 0.028 unit of CS (Roche Chemicals), 5-10 nM hMCD, and varying amounts of MCA substrate. Assays were initiated by the addition of MCA, and the rates were corrected for the background rate determined in the absence of hMCD.\n\n\nIsolated Working Rat Heart Assay Protocol\n\n\nIsolated working hearts from male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-350 g) are subjected to a 60-minute aerobic perfusion period. The working hearts are perfused with 95% O\n2\n, 5% CO\n2 \nwith a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution containing 5 mM glucose; 100 μU/mL insulin; 3% fatty acid-free BSA; 2.5 mM free Ca\n2+\n, and 0.4 to 1.2 mmol/L palmitate (Kantor et al., \nCirculation Research \n86:580-588 (2000)). The test compound is added 5 minutes before the perfusion period. DMSO (0.05%) is used as control.\n\n\nMeasurement of Glucose Oxidation Rates\n\n\nSamples were taken at 10-minute intervals for measurements of experimental parameters. Glucose oxidation rates are determined by the quantitative collection of \n14\nCO\n2 \nproduced by hearts perfused with buffer containing [U14]-Glucose (R. Barr and G. Lopaschuk, in “\nMeasurement of cardiovascular function\n”, McNeill, J. H. ed., Chapter 2, CRC press, New York (1997)). After the perfusion, the \n14\nCO\n2 \nfrom the perfusate is subsequently released by injecting 1 mL of perfusate into sealed test tube containing 1 mL of 9N H\n2\nSO\n4\n. The tube was sealed with a rubber stopper attached to a scintillation vial containing a piece of filter papers saturated with 300 μl of hyamine hydroxide. The scintillation vials with filter papers were then removed and Ecolite Scintillation Fluid added. Samples were counted by standard procedures as described above. Average rates of glucose oxidation for each phase of perfusion are expressed as μmol/min/g dry wt as described above.\n\n\nMeasurement of Fatty Acid Oxidation Rates:\n\n\nRates of fatty acid oxidation are determined using the same method as described above for glucose oxidation rate measurement using [\n14\nC]palmitate or by the quantitative collection of \n3\nH\n2\nO produced by hearts perfused with buffer containing [5-\n3\nH]palmitate (R. Barr and G. Lopaschuk, in “\nMeasurement of cardiovascular function\n”, McNeill, J. H. ed., Chapter 2, CRC press, New York (1997)). \n3\nH\n2\nO was separated from [5-\n3\nH]palmitate by treating 0.5 mL buffer samples with 1.88 mL of a mixture of chloroform/methanol (1:2 v:v) and then adding 0.625 mL of chloroform and 0.625 mL of a 2 M KCl/HCl solution. The sample is centrifuged for 10 min and aqueous phase was removed and treated with a mixture of 1 mL of chloroform, 1 mL of methanol and 0.9 mL KCl/HCl with a ration of 1:1:0.9. The aqueous layer was then counted for total \n3\nH\n2\nO determination. This process resulted in greater than 99.7% extraction and separation of \n3\nH\n2\nO from the palmitate. Average rates of fatty acid oxidation for each phase of perfusion are expressed as nmol/min/g dry wt after taking consideration the dilution factor.\n\n\nActive compounds are characterized by an increase in glucose oxidation and/or decrease in fatty acid oxidation as compared to the control experiments (DMSO). The compounds that caused statistically significant increases in glucose oxidation and/or decrease in fatty acid oxidation are considered to be active. Statistical significance was calculated using the Student's t test for paired or unpaired samples, as appropriate. The results with P<0.05 are considered to be statistically significant.\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n\nTo further illustrate this invention, the following examples are included.

A catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide (0.1 ml) was added and the mixture cooled to 0° C. under an atmosphere of Argon. After 20 minutes stirring at 0° C., oxalyl chloride (1.67 ml, 19.17 mmol) was slowly added to the reaction mixture, which was then allowed to warm to ambient temperature. This mixture was added slowly, after stirring 1 hour, to a 1 M solution of 6-isopropylamino-1,3-benzothiazole-2-thiol (2.16 g, 9.57 mmol) in anhydrous pyridine.

A pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of \nclaim 1\n and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or diluent. Description\n\n\n\n\nThis is the national phase application, under 35 USC 371, for PCT/US2005/045866, filed 16 Dec. 2005, which, claims the benefit, under 35 USC 119(e), of U.S. Provisional application No. 60/637,143, filed 17 Dec. 2004.\n\n\nFIELD OF INVENTION\n\n\nThe present invention is in the field of medicine, particularly in the treatment of obesity and diseases caused by or exacerbated by obesity. More specifically, the present invention relates to antagonists of melanin concentrating hormone useful in the prevention and treatment of obesity and related diseases.\n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\nThe affluence of the 1990's along with the exponential increase in food production particularly in Western and Asian economies has resulted in feed patters that lead to obesity. Obesity is defined as being excessively overweight. Excessive weight is generally characterized by excessive body fat because unused energy is stored in the adipose tissues as fat.\n\n\nObesity has associated with it, economic and social costs. Obese people, an increasing proportion of developed and developing societies, are regarded as having out of control feeding habits often associated with low self-esteem. Moreover, obese persons are more likely to have medical problems associated with or exacerbated by the excess body weight. Examples of medical conditions caused, exacerbated or triggered by excessive weight include bone fractures, pains in the knee joints, arthritis, increased risk of hypertension, atherosclerosis, stroke, diabetes, etc.\n\n\nMelanin concentrating hormone (MCH) is a 19 amino acid neuropeptide produced in the lateral hypothalamic area and zona incerta. Although MCH-expressing neurons project to numerous regions of the brain. MCH is processed from a larger pre-prohormone that also includes a second peptide, NEI, and possibly a third, NGE (Nahon, Crit Rev in Neurobiology, 8:221-262, 1994). MCH mediates its effects through at least two G protein-coupled receptors, MCHR1 and MCHR2 (Saito et al. Nature 400: 265-269, 1999; Hill et al., J Biol Chem. 276: 20125-20129, 2001). Both receptors are expressed in regions of the brain consistent with MCH neuronal projection and known MCH physiologic function (Hervieu et al., Eur J Neuroscience 12: 1194-1216, 2000; Hill et al., J Biol. Chem. 276: 20125-20129, 2001; Sailer et al., Proc Nat Acad. Sci. 98: 7564-7569, 2001).\n\n\nExtensive evidence exists to support the orexigenic activity of MCH. MCH mRNA is elevated in rodent models of obesity and in the fasted state (Qu et al., Nature 380: 243-247, 1996). Intra-cerebroventricularly administered MCH increases feeding and blocks the anorexic effect of α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (Ludwig et al., Am J Physiol 274: E627-E633, 1998). MCH knockout mice (MCH\n−/−\n mice) are lean, hypophagic and hypometabolic (Shimada et al., Nature 396: 670-674, 1998), while MCH over-expressing transgenic mice are obese and insulin resistant (Ludwig et al., J Clin Invest 107: 379-386, 2001). MCHR1\n−/−\n mice have recently been reported to be lean and hypermetabolic, indicating that the R1 isoform mediates at least some of the metabolic effects of MCH (Marsh et al., Proc Nat Acad Sci 99: 3240-3245, 2002).\n\n\nIn addition to its effects on feeding, MCH has been implicated in regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis through modulation of CRF and ACTH release (Bluet-Pajot et al., J Neuroendocrinol 7: 297-303, 1995). MCH may also play a role in the modulation of reproductive function (Murray et al., J Neuroendocrinol 12: 217-223, 2000) and memory (Monzon et al., Peptides 20: 1517-1519, 1999).\n\n\nThe current preferred treatment for obesity as well as Type II non-insulin dependent diabetes is diet and exercise with a view toward weight reduction and improved insulin sensitivity for diabetics.

mixture of enantiomers thereof.\n \n\n\nPreparing Compounds of the Invention\n\n\nScheme 1 shows a synthetic route for preparing a common intermediate VI generally utilized in the preparation of compounds of the invention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparation of the intermediate VI starts with the condensation of thioamide I and β-keto ester II as shown in step 1. This can be achieved in polar solvent (such as MeOH, EtOH or DMF) from about 2 to 24 hours (h) at a temperature range from about room temperature to 80° C. to give a thiazole of formula III.\n\n\nIn step 2, reduction of the ester III to the alcohol IV can be achieved using one of several methods well known in the literature. For example, ester III can be reduced with DIBAL (or other suitable reducing agent like LiAlH\n4\n, NaBH\n4\n, and LiBH4) in THF (or other aprotic solvent such as ether or toluene) from about 1 to 8 h at a temperature range from about −78° C. to 60° C. Compound IV is isolated by aqueous work-up and purified by means known in the art.\n\n\nAs shown in step 3, carboxylic acid V can be prepared from alcohol IV by dissolving in THF (or ether) at about −78° C., slowly treating with a solution of n-BuLi (or other suitable base such as LDA or HMDA) over about 2 to 4 hours, then treating with a solution of CO\n2 \n(g) in THF (or ether). Compound V is isolated by precipitation from a dilute aqueous solution and purified by means known in the art.\n\n\nThe use of a Dean-Stark trap accelerates the reaction by removing H\n2\nO as it is produced.\n\n\nStep 4 involves lactone formation to give VI using anhydrous conditions. For example, a solution of alcohol V in anhydrous toluene (or THF, benzene, etc.) is treated with an acid catalyst (ex. para-toluenesulfonic acid) and heated to reflux for 4 to 24 hours to cyclize to VI. The use of a Dean-Stark trap accelerates the reaction by removing H\n2\nO as it is produced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLactone VI can be elaborated to provide compounds of formula XIII as shown in Scheme 2. In step 5, a nitro compound of formula VII that contains a free OH or NH group is protected with an appropriate group, to give compound of formula VIII that can be removed later in the synthetic sequence. For example, 2-methoxy-4-nitro-phenol is protected as a silyl ether by dissolving the phenol in a polar solvent such as DMF or THF, treating with a base such as sodium hydride, and then adding triisopropylsilyl triflate (or similar silyl reagent like TBSCl, TIPSCl, or TBSOTf). The reactions is stirred within a temperature range of about RT to 50° C. for 1 to 24 hours then isolated via aqueous work-up and purified by means known in the art. Other protecting groups for an OH or NH group can be employed and are familiar to those skilled in the art (see Philip J. Kocienski, “Protecting Groups,” Thieme: New York 1994 or Theodora W. Green, “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis,” John Wiley and Sons: New York, 1981 for additional examples).\n\n\nIn step 6, a compound of formula VIII is prepared by reduction of the nitro group to give an amine of formula IX by treatment with 5-10% Pd/C under H\n2 \natmosphere (1 atm) in a suitable solvent (like THF, EtOAc, EtOH or MeOH) from about 2 to 24 hours at room temperature. Several other nitro reduction techniques known in the art can be employed.\n\n\nAmide formation, as shown in step 7, is accomplished using a typical Weinreb protocol (see Basha, Anwer; Lipton, M.; Weinreb, Steven M. Tetrahedron Letters, 1977, 48, 4171-4174). For example, amine IX is dissolved in an aprotic solvent (such as CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nor toluene) and treated with a 2-2.5M solution of Me\n3\nAl in hexanes. The resulting solution is stirred at a temperature from about 0° C. to room temperature for about 5 to 60 minutes, and then treated with lactone VI. The resulting solution is stirred at a range of between about room temperature and 110° C. for about 3 to 24 hours to give amide X which is isolated by aqueous work-up and purified by trituration with ether or by flash chromatography.\n\n\nIn step 8, lactam XI is prepared under Mitsunobu conditions (Maligres, P. E.; Waters, M. S.; Weissman, S. A.; McWilliams, J. C.; Lewis, S.; Cowen, J.; Reamer, R. A.; Volante, R. P.; Reider, P. J.; Askin, D. \nJ. Het. Chem. \n2003, 40 (2), 229-241). For example, amide X is dissolved in a suitable anhydrous solvent (ex. THF, CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, toluene, etc.) and treated with a trialkyl- or triarylphosphine (ex. Me\n3\nP, Bu\n3\nP, or Ph\n3\nP) and dialkylazo-dicarboxylate (ex. DEAD or DIAD) at a suitable temperature (about 0° C. to RT) for about 4 to 24 hours. Compound XI is isolated by aqueous workup and chromatographic purification.\n\n\nIn step 9, the protecting group that was installed in Step 5 is removed using conditions that are appropriate for the type of protecting group used to give compound of formula XII. For example, removal of a silyl ether, such as a triisopropylsilyl group, is achieved by dissolving the silyl ether in a polar solvent like THF or CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nand treating with a fluoride source such as nBu\n4\nNF or HF.pyridine. The reaction is stirred from about 15 minutes to 4 hours at a temperature within a range of about 0 to 50° C. and is isolated by aqueous work-up and purified by means known in the art.\n\n\nCompounds of formula XIII can be prepared by the alkylation of an NH or OH group (see step 10) by dissolving in a polar solvent (like THF, DMF, DMSO, and NMP) and treating with a base such as NaH or K\n2\nCO\n3 \nand an electrophile (e.g. alkyl halide, alkyl mesylate, or alkyl tosylate). The reaction is stirred within a range of about room temperature to about 100° C. from 4-24 hours and then isolated by aqueous work-up and purified by means known in the art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 3 shows an alternative route to compounds of formula XIII. In this approach, the alkylation of an NH or OH group occurs early in the synthetic sequence. For example, alkylation of VII as shown in Step 11 occurs under conditions similar to step 8 above to give compounds of formula XIV.\n\n\nIn step 13, the nitro group is reduced to an amine as described in step 5. Also, step 13 and 14 proceed under similar conditions as described in steps 7 and 8, respectively, to ultimately provide compounds of formula XIII.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchemes 4 and 5 show synthetic routes for preparing thiazole-pyridone compounds of the invention and/or precursors thereof.\n\n\nIn step 13 of scheme 4, pyridone XVII is prepared in one step by the oxidation of intermediate alcohol X. For example compound X is dissolved in a suitable polar solvent (e.g. CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, THF) and treated with an oxidizing reagent (e.g. Dess-Martin periodinane, pyridine.SO\n3\n, PDC, or under Swern-oxidation conditions). Oxidation conditions are abundantly known to those skilled in the art and can be found in \nComprehensive Organic Transformations\n, by R. C. Larock, VCH Publishers, 1989, p. 604-614. Dess-Martin periodinane is the reagent of choice for this transformation and the oxidation is performed at about 0° C. to room temperature from about 1 hour to 3 days. Pyridone XVII is isolated by aqueous workup and chromatographic purification.\n\n\nIn step 14, analogous to step 9 above, removal of the protecting group to reveal an NH or OH group is achieved under similar conditions and the compound of formula XVIII is isolated by aqueous work-up and purified by means known in the art.\n\n\nAlkylation of the OH or NH group of XVIII (step 15) can occur under basic conditions with an alkylating reagent, as described in step 10 above, or under Mitsunobu conditions to provide compounds of formula XIX.\n\n\nAlternatively, and as shown in step 16 of Scheme 5, intermediate XVI can be oxidized with the sidechain already installed using similar conditions as described in step 13 above to afford thiazole-pyridone compounds of formula XIX.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 6 shows a synthetic route for preparing compounds of the invention from an intermediate acetal wherein L\n1 \nis an alkylene of varying carbon chain lengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf groups A, B and D (Compound XIII) together define an acetal group (such as A=CH and B=D=OMe or OEt), then hydrolysis to an aldehyde group is performed according to conditions recognized by persons skilled in the art (Scheme 6). For example, in step 17 acetal XX is dissolved in a suitable solvent (e.g. THF, acetone, MeOH) and treated with water and an acid catalyst (e.g. p-toluenesulfonic acid) at reflux for about 4 to 24 hours to give aldehyde XXI. Reductive amination (step 18) is performed by dissolving the aldehyde XXI in dichloroethane or another suitable solvent such as for example, CH\n2\nCl\n2 \nor THF and treated with an 1° or 2° amine and a reducing reagent such as for example NaCNBH\n3\n, or NaBH(OAc)\n3\n. The mixture is stirred at about RT to 80° C. from about 30 min to 8 hours. Amines of formula XXII are isolated by aqueous workup and purified by means known in the art.\n\n\nScheme 7 shows an alternative synthetic route for preparing compounds of the invention and/or precursors thereof. In step 19, lactone VI is treated with a protected amine using conditions previously described in step 7 to give amide XXIII. In step 19, Lactam XXIV is prepared using conditions previously described in step 8. The lactam nitrogen is deprotected, as shown in step 21, using conditions consistent with the type of protecting group that is used. For example, a 3,4-dimethoxy benzyl group is removed under acidic conditions (e.g. p-toluene sulfonic acid or TFA) in a solvent such as toluene at a temperature range of RT to reflux for 0.5 to 4 h. Lactam XXIV is isolated by precipitation from water and purified by means known in the art.\n\n\nIn step 22, the lactam is coupled to an aryl bromide using catalytic cross-coupling conditions such as Buchwald arylation of an amide (see Yin, J.; Buchwald, S. J. \nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. \n2002, 124 (21), 6043-6048). For example, lactam of formula XXIV is coupled to bromide XXV (where P2 is a protecting group for an OH or NH group) using a base such as for example, Cs\n2\nCO\n3\n), a palladium reagent such as. Pd\n2 \ndba\n3\n, and a phosphine ligand such as Xantphos™ in a non-protic solvent (ex. dioxane, toluene, benzene etc.). The reaction is performed at a temperature range of about RT to reflux from about 3 to 24 h and is then isolated by aqueous work-up and purified by means known in the art.\n\n\nAs shown in step 23, the protecting group of XXVII is removed using conditions consistent with the type of protecting group that is used. For example, a silyl ether is removed using a Bu\n4\nNF. In addition, a p-toluene sulfonate ester is removed under basic conditions using for example, LiOH in 2:1 dioxane water, to afford a compound of formula XI.\n\n\nIn step 24, alkylation of the free NH or OH group of XII is achieved using conditions previously described in step 8 to afford a compound of formula XIII.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme 8 shows the preferred synthesis of substituted morpholines that are used as reagents in the synthesis of compounds of the invention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn step 25, the amino group of methallyl amine (XXVII) is protected with a benzyl group via a reductive amination. Amine XXVIII is dissolved in a polar aprotic solvent like and treated with benzaldehyde. The imine intermediate is then reduced with a reducing reagent like NaBH\n4 \nfor 10-24 hours at a temperature range of room temperature to 50° C. to give an amine of formula XXIX that is isolated by aqueous work-up and purified by means known in the art.\n\n\nIn step 26, an amine of formula XXIX is alkylated by treating with an epoxide (for example, isobutylene oxide) and Lewis acid such as LiBr at a temperature range from room temperature to 60° C. for 1 to 8 hours to give alcohol of formula XXX. The product is isolated by aqueous work-up and purified by means known in the art.\n\n\nIn step 27, the preferred method for forming the substituted morpholine is via halo-etherification methodology. In this approach, an alcohol of formula XXX is treated with iodine. The reaction is performed in a biphasic mixture of a nonpolar aprotic solvent, such as MTBE, and an aqueous basic solution (for example, 1M NaHCO\n3\n) for 12 to 24 h. The iodide of formula XXXI is then isolated by aqueous work-up and purified by means known in the art.\n\n\nIn step 28, the iodide is removed under reducing conditions to give the benzyl morpholine of formula XXXII. Typical conditions to remove an alkyl iodide group are to dissolve the iodide XXXI in a polar solvent such as DMSO and treat with a reducing reagent like NaBH\n4 \nfor 2 to 6 hours. Morpholine of formula XXXII is isolated by aqueous work-up and purified by means known in the art.\n\n\nIn step 29, the benzyl protecting group is removed under typical reductive conditions that are recognized by persons skilled in the art. For example, compound of formula XXXII is dissolved in suitable solvent (example THF, ETOH), treated with 3% palladium on activated carbon under hydrogen atmosphere that is pressurized up to 60 psi at 40° C. for up to 24 h. Morpholine of formula XXXIII is purified by means known in the art and can be isolated as the hydrochloride salt by treating with an HCl source (ex. 1.0M HCl in ether).\n\n\nDemonstration of Function\n\n\nIn order to demonstrate that compounds of the present invention have the capacity to bind to and inhibit the function of MCHR1, binding and functional assays were established. All ligands, radioligands, solvents and reagents employed in these assays are readily available from commercial sources or can be readily prepared by those skilled in the art.\n\n\nThe full-length cDNA for human MCHR1 was cloned from a human adult brain cDNA library (Edge Biosystems, Cat. 38356) by standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology employing the following primers: sense, 5′-GCCACCATGGACCT GGAAGCCTCGCTGC-3′; anti-sense, 5′-TGGTGCCCTGACTTGGAGGTGTGC-3′. The PCR reaction was performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 5 μl of a 10× stock solution of PCR buffer, 1 μl of 10 mM dNTP mixture (200 μM final), 2 μl of 50 mM Mg(SO\n4\n) (2 mM final), 0.5 μl of 20 μM solutions of each primer (0.2 μM final), 5 μl of template cDNA containing 0.5 ng DNA, 0.5 μl of Platinum Taq High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Gibco Life Technologies) and 36 μl of H\n2\nO. PCR amplification was performed on a Perkin Elmer 9600 thermocycler. After denaturation for 90 sec at 94° C., the amplification sequence consisting of 94° C. for 25 sec, 55° C. for 25 sec and 72° C. for 2 min was repeated 30 times, followed by a final elongation step at 72° C. for 10 min. The desired PCR product (1.1 Kb) was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the band was extracted from the gel by Geneclean (Bio101) following the manufacturer's instructions. Following extraction, the cDNA fragment was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen Corp) to confirm the identity and sequence.\n\n\nIn order to generate cell lines stably expressing MCHR1, the insert was then subcloned into the Xba I and Not I sites of pcDNA(+)-3.1-neomycin (Invitrogen). After purification by Qiagen Maxi-prep kit (QIAGEN, Inc.), the plasmid was transfected by Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) into AV12 cells that had been previously transfected with the promiscuous G protein G\nα15\n. The transfected cells were selected by G418 (800 μg/ml) for 10-14 days and single colonies were isolated from culture plates. The G418-resistant colonies were further selected for MCHR1 expression by measuring MCH-stimulated Ca\n2+\n transients with a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices).\n\n\nTypically, individual clones are plated out in 96-well plates at 60,000 cells per well in 100 μl of growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.5 mg/ml Zeocin, and 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin). After 24 hrs at 37° C., medium is removed and replaced with 50 μl of dye loading buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 25 mM HEPES, 0.04% Pluronate 127 and 8 μM Fluo3 Both from Molecular Probes)). After a 60 min loading period at room temperature, dye loading buffer is aspirated and replaced with 100 μl of HEPES/HBBS. Plate is placed in FLIPR and basal readings are taken for 10 sec, at which point 100 μl of buffer containing 2 μM MCH (1 μM final) is added and measurements are taken over 105 sec. To correct for variations between clones in numbers of cells per well, the MCH response is normalized to the response induced by epinephrine.\n\n\nBoth the \n125\nI-MCH binding and functional GTPγ\n35\nS binding assays employed membranes isolated from a clone designated as clone 43. Typically, cells from 20 confluent T225 flasks were processed by washing the monolayers in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraping the cells into same and re-suspending the cell pellet in 35 ml of 250 mM Sucrose, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, 24 μg/ml DNase I, and protease inhibitors (1 Complete® tablet, per 50 ml of buffer prepared, Roche Diagnostics). Alternatively, greater levels of cells could be generated by adapting cell growth to suspension culture in 20 L stirred vessel bioreactors. After incubation on ice for 5 min, cells were disrupted with 20-25 strokes of a Teflon/Glass homogenizer attached to an overhead motorized stirrer, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in Beckman Type 70.1 Ti rotor. The pellets were re-suspended in 250 mM Sucrose, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mM CaCl\n2\n, 1 mM MgSO\n4 \nand protease inhibitors by Teflon/Glass homogenization to achieve a protein concentration of ˜3-5 mg/ml (Pierce BCA assay with Bovine serum albumin as standard). Aliquots were stored at −70° C.\n\n\nBinding of compounds to MCHR1 was assessed in a competitive binding assay employing \n125\nI-MCH, compound and clone 43 membranes. Briefly, assays are carried out in 96-well Costar 3632 white opaque plates in a total volume of 200 μl containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mM CaCl\n2\n, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 5 μg of clone 43 membranes, 200 pM \n125\nI-MCH (NEN), 0.625 mg/ml of wheat germ agglutinin scintillation proximity assay beads (WGA-SPA beads, Amersham Inc., now GE Healthcare) and a graded dose of test compound. Non-specific binding is assessed in the presence of 0.1 μM unlabeled MCH. Bound \n125\nI-MCH is determined by placing sealed plates in a Microbeta Trilux (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences Inc.) and counting after a 12 hr delay.\n\n\nIC\n50 \nvalues (defined as the concentration of test compound required to reduce specific binding of \n125\nI-MCH by 50%) are determined by fitting the concentration-response data to a 4-parameter model (max response, min response, Hill coefficient, IC\n50\n) using Excel® (Microsoft Corp.). K\ni \nvalues are calculated from IC\n50 \nvalues using the Cheng-Prusoff approximation as described by Cheng et al. (Relationship between the inhibition constant (K\ni\n) and the concentration of inhibitor which causes 50% inhibition (IC\n50\n) of an enzymatic reaction, \nBiochem. Pharmacol., \n22: 3099-3108 (1973)). The K\nd \nfor \n125\nI-MCH is determined independently from a saturation binding isotherm. Exemplified compounds showed a Ki of <1 μM under the binding assay conditions.

Briefly, assays are carried out in Costar 3632 white opaque plates in a total volume of 200 μl containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl\n2\n, 10 μg/ml saponin, 1.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 mM NaCl, 3 μM GDP, 0.3 nM GTPγ\n35\nS, 10 nM MCH (approximately equal to EC\n90\n), 20 μg of clone 43 membranes, 5.0 mg/ml of wheat germ agglutinin scintillation proximity assay beads (WGA-SPA beads, Amersham Inc., now GE Healthcare) and a graded dose of test compound. The plates are sealed and left for 16-18 hrs at 4° C. After a 1 hr delay to allow plates to equilibrate to ambient temperature, bound GTPγ\n35\nS is determined by counting in a Microbeta Trilux (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences Inc).\n\n\nIC\n50 \nvalues (defined as the concentration of test compound required to reduce MCH-stimulated GTPγ\n35\nS binding by 50%) are determined by fitting the concentration-response data to a 4-parameter model (max response, min response, Hill coefficient, IC\n50\n) using Excel (Microsoft).

Vehicle consisted of 1% CMC and 0.25% PS-80 in water.\n\n\nAnimals were individually housed in a temperature regulated room (24° C.) with a reverse 12 hour light/dark cycle (dark 10:00/22:00). Water and food (Teklad 95217, Harlan, Wis.) were available ad libitum. Compounds were dosed orally once a day before onset of dark for 3 days. Daily food intake and body weight change were measured for the 3 day period. Exemplified compounds tested at 10 mg/kg showed reduction of 3 day cumulative body weight gain when compared with vehicle-treated controls. Specifically, a sample of observed 3 day cumulative body weight reduction, relative to control, is provided in Table 2 (below) for demonstration purposes only.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTABLE 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBody weight reduction @ 10 mg/Kg versus vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExample #\n\n\ncontrol.

The diseases, disorders or conditions for which compounds of the present invention are useful in treating or preventing include, but are not limited to, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis of coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral arteries, gastrointestinal disorders including peptic ulcer, esophagitis, gastritis and duodenitis, (including that induced by \nH. pylori\n), intestinal ulcerations (including inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and proctitis) and gastrointestinal ulcerations, neurogenic inflammation of airways, including cough, asthma, depression, prostate diseases such as benign prostate hyperplasia, irritable bowel syndrome and other disorders needing decreased gut motility, diabetic retinopathy, neuropathic bladder dysfunction, elevated intraocular pressure and glaucoma and non-specific diarrhea dumping syndrome. The diseases, disorders or conditions for which compounds of the present invention are useful in treating or preventing also include, stress related disorders including post traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, including alcohol and drug abuse, and nonpharamcologic disorders such as gambling, sex and internet related addictions. By inhibiting MCH activity the compounds of the present invention provide anorexic effects. That is, the compounds of the invention are useful as appetite suppressants and/or weight loss agents. The compounds of the invention may also be used in combination with other approved therapeutic agents for the treatment, prevention and/or amelioration of obesity and related diseases. In this format, the compounds of the present invention enhance the positive effects of such approved combination treatments while minimizing the side effects due to the potential requirement of lower doses of such combination compounds. Such combination therapies may be delivered individually or in a combined formulation. Examples of compounds useful in combination with a compound of formula I include weight loss agents (Meridia™, Xenical™), cholesterol lowering agents (such as for example lovastatin, simvastatin pravastatin, fluvastatin, and atorvastatin), glucose level control or modulating agents, nerve growth factor agonists (such as for example, axokine), cannabinoid CB-1 antagonist compounds (such as for example rimonanbant) and the like.\n\n\nIn treating non-human, non-companion animals, the compounds of the present invention are useful for reducing weight gain and/or improving the feed utilization efficiency and/or increasing lean body mass.\n\n\nFormulation\n\n\nThe compound of formula I is preferably formulated in a unit dosage form prior to administration. Therefore, yet another embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a compound of formula I and a pharmaceutical carrier.\n\n\nThe present pharmaceutical formulations are prepared by known procedures using well-known and readily available ingredients. In making the formulations of the present invention, the active ingredient (formula I compound) will usually be mixed with a carrier, or diluted by a carrier, or enclosed within a carrier which may be in the form of a liquid, tablet, capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the carrier serves as a diluent, it may be a solid, semisolid or liquid material which acts as a vehicle, excipient or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosol (as a solid or in a liquid medium), soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions and sterile packaged powders. One of skill in the art is aware of methods, reagents and conditions for preparing various standard formulations or can assess such information without undue experimentation. The compositions of the invention may be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient.\n\n\nDose\n\n\nThe specific dose administered is determined by the particular circumstances surrounding each situation. These circumstances include, the route of administration, the prior medical history of the patient, the pathological condition or symptom being treated, the severity of the condition/symptom being treated, and the age and sex of the recipient. However, it will be understood that the therapeutic dosage administered will be determined by the physician in the light of the relevant circumstances, or by the veterinarian for non-human recipients.\n\n\nGenerally, an effective minimum daily dose of a compound of formula I is about 20 to 200 mg. Typically, an effective maximum dose is about 200 to 1000 mg. The exact dose may be determined, in accordance with the standard practice in the medical arts of “dose titrating” the recipient; that is, initially administering a low dose of the compound, and gradually increasing the dose until the desired therapeutic effect is observed.\n\n\nRoute of Administration\n\n\nThe compounds may be administered by a variety of routes including the oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, topical, intravenous, intramuscular or intranasal routes. Ap referred route of administration is oral.\n\n\nCombination Therapy\n\n\nA compound of formula I may be used in combination with other drugs or therapies that have been approved for the treatment/prevention/suppression or amelioration of the diseases or conditions for which compounds of formula I are useful. Such other drug(s) may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of formula I. When a compound of formula I is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical unit dosage form containing such other drugs in addition to the compound of formula I is preferred. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that also contain one or more other active ingredients, in addition to a compound of formula I. Examples of other active ingredients that may be combined (upon approval) with a compound of formula I, and either administered separately or in the same pharmaceutical composition, include, but are not limited to:\n\n \n \n \n \n(a) insulin sensitizers including (i) PPARγ agonists such as the glitazones (e.g. troglitazone, pioglitazone, englitazone, MCC-555, BRL9653 and the like), and compounds disclosed in WO97/27857, 97/28115, 97/28137 and 97/27847; (ii) biguanides such as metformin;\n \n(b) insulin or insulin mimetics;\n \n(c) sulfonylureas such as tolbutamide and glipizide;\n \n(d) alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (such as acarbose);\n \n(e) cholesterol lowering agents such as\n        \n \ni.
