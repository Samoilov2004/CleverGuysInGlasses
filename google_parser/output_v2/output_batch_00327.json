No. 61/078,867 filed Jul. 8, 2008.\n\n\n \nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \n1. Technical Field\n\n\n \n \n \n \nto This invention relates to NHE-1 inhibitors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n2. Background Information\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe Na\n+\n/H\n+\n exchanger (NHE) is a protein that is expressed in many mammalian cell types. NHE is an integral membrane glycoprotein expressed ubiquitously in mammalian cells, and it is responsible for regulating intracellular pH, the concentration of intracellular sodium (NaI) and cell volume regulation by extruding protons from and taking up sodium ions into cells. Nine isoforms of this exchanger have been described: NHE-1 to NHE-9. NHE-1, the first isoform to be cloned, is expressed ubiquitously in the plasma membrane and is considered to be the cardiac-specific isoform. The inward gradient of Na\n+\n, produced mainly by the Na\n+\n/K\n+\n ATPase provides a constant driving force for H\n+\n extrusion and Na\n+\n influx through the NHE. NHE-1 is activated by growth factors and is expressed in several cell types, mainly in mammalian cardiomyocytes, platelets and on the basolateral membrane of renal tubules. Under normal physiological conditions, approximately 60% of the proton removal capabilities of the cardiac cell are accomplished via NHE-1, and NHE-1 carries about 50% of the Na\n+\n entering the cell. Activation of the exchanger results in (1) decreased intracellular H\n+\n (increase of pHi), (2) increased [Na\n+\n]\ni \nand (3) secondary to elevation of [Na\n+\n]i increased intracellular calcium ([Ca\n++\n]i) levels mediated by the Na\n+\n/Ca\n++\n-exchanger (NCX).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn cardiac ischemia, NHE-1 is activated by a decrease in intracellular pH. This results in an increase in intracellular Ca\n++\n levels as described above. Upon reperfusion, the intracellular/extracellular H\n+\n gradient increases, again activating NHE-1 and increasing Ca\n+\n levels. The increase of Ca\n++\n levels in ischemia/reperfusion results in cell injury, contributing to arrhythmia and cardiac tissue damage. Therefore, investigators were interested in discovering inhibitors of NHE-1. Several NHE-1 inhibitors have been reported in the literature and have demonstrated good activity in limiting ischemia/reperfusion injury in animal models (B. Masereel et al. An overview of inhibitors of Na\n+\n/H\n+\n exchanger. \nEur J Med Chem, \n2003, 38: 547-554). The efficacy of NHE-1 inhibitors in experimental studies on ischemia/reperfusion led to clinical trials for the evaluation of some of these agents for example, in high risk patients with coronary artery disease (R. W. Erhardt, GUARD during ischemia against necrosis (GUARDIAN) trial in acute coronary syndromes. \nAm J Cardiol, \n1999, 83: 23G-25G) and acute myocardial infarction (U. Zeymer et al., The Na\n+\n/H\n+\n exchange inhibitor eniporide as an adjunct to early reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction: results of the Evaluation of the Safety and Cardioprotective effects of eniporide in Acute Myocardial Infarction (ESCAMI) trial. \nJ Am Coll Cardiol, \n2001, 38: 1644-1650). Proof of concept was demonstrated for a cardiac protective effect of NHE-1 inhibitors in clinical studies such as these when acute treatment (up to 7 days) was begun early in an ischemic event in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Despite the salutary effects, all NHE-1 inhibitors that have advanced to Phase II and III clinical trials in acute indications (e.g., CABG) have failed to demonstrate any improvement in overall mortality due either to inadequate efficacy or the occurrence of serious adverse events. As a result, all disclosed NHE-I clinical development programs for acute therapy appear to have been terminated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore recent studies have suggested that inhibitors of NHE-1 may be beneficial as a chronic treatment to prevent structural and functional remodeling and increase survival in heart failure patients (M. Karmazyn, Role of sodium-hydrogen exchange in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure: a novel and promising therapeutic target. \nBasic Res Cardio, \n2001 96: 325-328).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCardiac hypertrophy is a major risk factor for cardiac death and commonly precedes the development of heart failure. Hypertrophy is the cellular response to an increase in biomechanical stress. Cardiac hypertrophy eventually normalizes the increase in wall tension, there by abrogating the initial stimulus. Prolonged hypertrophy however is associated with an increased risk for the development of arrhythmias and heart failure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore, prevention of development of hypertrophy may be beneficial. Recent evidence suggests that NHE-1 is important in cardiac growth and that its activity is augmented by hypertrophic factors such as alpha-adrenergic and beta1-adrenergic activation, endothelin-1, and angiotensin II which has led to the hypothesis that NHE-1 may be a downstream mediator of these factors and that inhibition would prevent or reduce cellular hypertrophy and the HF process (L. Fliegel and M. Karmazyn, The cardiac Na—H exchanger: a key downstream mediator for the cellular hypertrophic effects of paracrine, autocrine and hormonal factors. \nBiochem Cell Biol, \n2004, 82: 626-635). In addition, inhibition of NHE-1 also may prevent the increase in intracellular to Na\n+\n, Ca\n++\n and intracellular pH, all three parameters associated with cellular growth.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nNHE-1 has been implicated in different models of hypertrophy, such as post-infarction myocardial hypertrophy, “hypertensive” myocardium, aortic constriction-induced hypertrophy, and pacing-induced hypertrophy. Different models of hypertrophy and heart failure have demonstrated the effect of chronic in vivo inhibition of NHE-1 (see for example, S. Aker et al, Inhibition of the Na\n+\n/H\n+\n-exchanger attenuates the deterioration of ventricular function during pacing-induced heart failure in rabbits. \nCardiovasc Res, \n2004, 63: 273-282; A. Baartscheer et al., Chronic inhibition of Na\n+\n/H\n+\n-exchanger attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and prevents cellular remodeling in heart failure. \nCardiovasc Res, \n2005, 65: 83-92; L. Chen, et al., Inhibition and reversal of myocardial infarction-induced hypertrophy and heart failure by NHE-1 inhibition. \nAm J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol, \n2004, 286: H381-H387). The main focus of these studies was the development of hypertrophy and contractile function. It was found that chronic inhibition of NHE-1 attenuated development of cardiac hypertrophy and improved contractile performance, which was associated, in most of the studies, with less signs of heart failure. Also, it was found that the survival rate improved and that fibrotic structural changes and presence of apoptosis were decreased.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe above studies showed NHE-1 inhibition as a monotherapy provided extensive benefit in both structural and functional remodeling in various preclinical heart failure models, including many of the same models where ACE-I has also demonstrated a beneficial response. When treatments have been combined (NHE-1 inhibitor cariporide with ACE-I inhibitor ramapril), the benefit has been either additive or synergistic. For example, in post MI-rats, monotherapy with either cariporide or ramipril tended, but non-significantly, to decrease left ventricle dilation, whereas the combined treatment significantly reduced it. (H. Ruetten et al., Effects of combined inhibition of the Na\n+\n-H\n+\n exchanger and angiotensin-converting enzyme in rats with congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction. \nBritish Journal of Pharmacology, \n2005, 146: 723-731) Therefore, the beneficial effect of NHE-1 inhibition in addition to ACE-1 may have important clinical implications for patients with heart failure, particularly as the effect of NHE-1 inhibition may be independent of current treatment options. Studies such as those cited above support a role for NHE-1 in heart failure and provide a therapeutic rationale for the development of NHE-1 inhibitors that can be administered as a chronic to therapy.\n\n\n \nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nIt has been found that compounds of the present invention and certain derivatives thereof are inhibitors of the sodium proton exchanger

compound is defined by the structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention also relates to pharmaceutical preparations, containing as active substance one or more compounds of the invention, or the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, optionally combined with conventional excipients and/or carriers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention also include their isotopically-labelled forms. An isotopically-labelled form of an active agent of a combination of the present invention is identical to said active agent but for the fact that one or more atoms of said active agent have been replaced by an atom or atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number of said atom which is usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes which are readily available commercially and which can be incorporated into an active agent of a combination of the present invention in accordance with well established procedures, include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, e.g., \n2\nH, \n3\nH, \n13\nC, \n14\nC, \n15\nN, \n18\nO, \n17\nO, \n31\nP, \n32\n, \n35\nS, \n18\nF, and \n36\nCl, respectively. An active agent of a combination of the present invention, a prodrug thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of either which contains one or more of the above-mentioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms is contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes the use of any compounds of described above containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms may occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. Isomers shall be defined as being enantiomers and diastereomers. All such isomeric forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. Each stereogenic carbon may be in the R or S configuration, or a combination of configurations.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome of the compounds of the invention can exist in more than one tautomeric form.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes methods using all such tautomers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll terms as used herein in this specification, unless otherwise stated, shall be understood in their ordinary meaning as known in the art. For example, “C\n1-4\nalkoxy” is a C\n1-4\nalkyl with a terminal oxygen, such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy. All alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl groups shall be understood as being branched or unbranched where structurally possible and unless otherwise specified. Other more specific definitions are as follows:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCarbocycles include hydrocarbon rings containing from three to twelve carbon atoms. These carbocycles may be either aromatic or non-aromatic ring systems. The non-aromatic ring systems may be mono- or polyunsaturated. Preferred carbocycles include but are not limited to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexenyl, cycloheptanyl, cycloheptenyl, phenyl, indanyl, indenyl, benzocyclobutanyl, dihydronaphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, naphthyl, decahydronaphthyl, benzocycloheptanyl and benzocycloheptenyl. Certain terms for cycloalkyl such as cyclobutanyl and cyclobutyl shall be used interchangeably.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heterocycle” refers to a stable nonaromatic 4-8 membered (but preferably, 5 or 6 membered) monocyclic or nonaromatic 8-11 membered bicyclic or spirocyclic heterocycle radical which may be either saturated or unsaturated. Each heterocycle consists of carbon atoms and one or more, preferably from 1 to 4 heteroatoms chosen from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. The heterocycle may be attached by any atom of the cycle, which results in the creation of a stable structure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroaryl” shall be understood to mean an aromatic 5-8 membered monocyclic or 8-11 membered bicyclic ring containing 1-4 heteroatoms such as N, O and S.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nUnless otherwise stated, heterocycles and heteroaryl include but are not limited to, for example azetidinyl, furanyl, pyranyl, benzoxazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzimidazolyl, tetrahydropyranyl, dioxanyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyrrolyl, pyrrolidinyl, pyrrolidinone, imidazolyl, thienyl, thiadiazolyl, thiomorpholinyl, 1,1-dioxo-1λ\n6\n-thiomorpholinyl, morpholinyl, pyridinyl, pyridinone, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, triazinyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, purinyl, quinolinyl, Dihydro-2H-quinolinyl, tetrahydroquinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, quinazolinyl, indazolyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, benzofuranyl, benzopyranyl and benzodioxolyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “heteroatom” as used herein shall be understood to mean atoms other than carbon such as O, N, S and P.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn all alkyl groups or carbon chains one or more carbon atoms can be optionally replaced by heteroatoms: O, S or N, it shall be understood that if N is not substituted then it is NH, it shall also be understood that the heteroatoms may replace either to terminal carbon atoms or internal carbon atoms within a branched or unbranched carbon chain. Such groups can be substituted as herein above described by groups such as oxo to result in definitions such as but not limited to: alkoxycarbonyl, acyl, amido and thioxo.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “aryl” as used herein shall be understood to mean aromatic carbocycle or heteroaryl as defined herein. Each aryl or heteroaryl unless otherwise specified includes it's partially or fully hydrogenated derivative. For example, quinolinyl may include decahydroquinolinyl and tetrahydroquinolinyl, naphthyl may include its hydrogenated derivatives such as tetrahydranaphthyl. Other partially or fully hydrogenated derivatives of the aryl and heteroaryl compounds described herein will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs used herein, “nitrogen” and “sulfur” include any oxidized form of nitrogen and sulfur and the quaternized form of any basic nitrogen. For example, for an —S—C\n1-6 \nalkyl radical, unless otherwise specified, this shall be understood to include —S(O)—C\n1-6 \nalkyl and —S(O)\n2\n—C\n1-6 \nalkyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “alkyl” refers to a saturated aliphatic radical containing from one to ten carbon atoms or a mono- or polyunsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical containing from two to twelve carbon atoms. The mono- or polyunsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical containing at least one double or triple bond, respectively. “Alkyl” refers to both branched and unbranched alkyl groups. It should be understood that any combination term using an “alk” or “alkyl” prefix refers to analogs according to the above definition of “alkyl”. For example, terms such as “alkoxy”, “alkylhio” refer to alkyl groups linked to a second group via an oxygen or sulfur atom. “Alkanoyl” (or acyl) refers to an alkyl group linked to a carbonyl group (C═O).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe term “halogen” as used in the present specification shall be understood to mean bromine, chlorine, fluorine or iodine, preferably fluorine. The definitions “halogenated”, “partially or fully halogenated”; “partially or fully fluorinated”; “substituted by one or more halogen atoms”, includes for example, mono, di or tri halo derivatives on one or more carbon atoms. For alkyl, a nonlimiting example would be —CH\n2\nCHF\n2\n, —CF\n3 \netc.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nEach alkyl (or any term using an “alk” or “alkyl” prefix), carbocycle, heterocycle or heteroaryl, or the analogs thereof, described herein shall be understood to be optionally partially or fully halogenated.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the invention are only those which are contemplated to be ‘chemically stable’ as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. For example, a compound which would have a ‘dangling valency’, or a ‘carbanion’ are not compounds contemplated by the inventive methods disclosed herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe invention includes pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of compounds of formula (I). A “pharmaceutically acceptable derivative” refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester, or any other compound which, upon administration to a patient, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound useful for the invention, or a pharmacologically active metabolite or pharmacologically active residue thereof. A pharmacologically active metabolite shall be understood to mean any compound of the invention capable of being metabolized enzymatically or chemically. This includes, for example, hydroxylated or oxidized derivative compounds of the invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable salts include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of suitable acids include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, perchloric, fumaric, maleic, phosphoric, glycolic, lactic, salicylic, succinic, toluene-p-sulfuric, tartaric, acetic, citric, methanesulfonic, formic, benzoic, malonic, naphthalene-2-sulfuric and benzenesulfonic acids. Other acids, such as oxalic acid, while not themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal (e.g., sodium), alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium), ammonium and N—(C\n1\n-C\n4 \nalkyl)-4+ salts.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, within the scope of the invention is use of prodrugs of compounds of the invention. Prodrugs include those compounds that, upon simple chemical transformation, are modified to produce compounds of the invention. Simple chemical transformations include hydrolysis, oxidation and reduction. Specifically, when a prodrug is administered to a patient, the prodrug may be transformed into a compound to disclosed hereinabove, thereby imparting the desired pharmacological effect.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I may be made using the general synthetic methods described below, which also constitute part of the invention.\n\n\n \nGeneral Synthetic Methods\n\n\n \n \n \nThe invention additionally provides methods for making the compounds of formula I. The compounds of the invention may be prepared by the general methods and examples presented below, and methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art and reported in the chemical literature. Unless otherwise specified, solvents, temperatures, pressures, and other reaction conditions may be readily selected by one of ordinary skill in the art. Specific procedures are provided in the Synthetic Examples section. Starting materials used are either commercially available or easily prepared from commercially available materials by those skilled in the art. Reaction progress may be monitored by conventional methods such as thin layer chromatography (TLC) or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Intermediates and products may be purified by methods known in the art, including flash chromatography, HPLC or recrystallization. Amide bond formations may be carried out by standard coupling conditions well-known in the art (see, for example, M. Bodanszky, \nThe Practice of Peptide Synthesis \n(Springer-Verlag: 1984), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety), for example, by reacting a carbocylic acid and an amine in the presence of 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Racemic compounds of this invention may be prepared in enantiomerically pure or enriched form by methods known in the art, including separation using chiral HPLC, resolution using a chiral reagent or auxiliary, and other asymmetric synthesis methods known in the art. If certain functional groups are incompatible under the reaction conditions, protection/deprotection of these groups may be carried out using reagents and conditions readily selected by one of ordinary skill in the art (see, for example, P. G. M. Wuts and T. W. Greene, \nGreene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis \n(John Wiley & Sons: 2006), which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe methods described below and in the Synthetic Examples section may be used to to prepare the compounds of formula I.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the schemes below, R\n1\n-R\n3 \nand x shall have the meanings defined in the detailed description of formula I.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of formula I may be prepared as shown in Scheme 1. As illustrated in Scheme I, a Suzuki reaction with a benzoic acid ester (R′ is alkyl) (II) substituted with R\n2 \nand R\n3 \nand bearing a suitable leaving group in the 4-position such as a bromine or a triflate group and a N-protected tetrahydropiperidine (III) bearing a boronic ester group in the 4-position such as the 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl[1,3,2]dioxaborolan-2-yl group shown on III, in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as (Ph\n3\nP)\n4\nPd and a suitable base such as K\n2\nCO\n3 \nprovides intermediate IV. Reduction of the olefin, for example by treatment with hydrogen in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as Pd/C provides V. Hydrolysis of the ester provides carboxylic acid VI.

LCMS: 549.20 (M+H\n+\n).\n\n\n \nStep E: N-(4-Piperidin-4-yl-3-trifluoromethyl-benzoyl)-(N′-tert-butoxycarbonyl)-guanidine\n\n\n \n \n \nTo a solution of the product from Step D (3.11 g, 5.67 mmol) in ethanol (75 mL) under and argon atmosphere is added 20 wt % palladium(II) hydroxide on carbon (250 mg, 0.18 mmol, 50% wet) and the reaction is stirred under a hydrogen atmosphere for 16 hours. The resulting mixture is filtered through Celite and the solvent is removed in vacuo to afford a crude foamy solid. The crude solids are redissolved in dichlormethane to and trated with 1 N hydrogen chloride in ether (7 mL) and the resulting mixture is diluted with hexane. The resulting crude solid is triturated twice with dichloromethane and twice with ether to afford the desired product as a colorless solid (2.15 g, 84%). LCMS: 415.72 (M+H\n+\n).\n\n\n \nStep F: N-{4-[1-(Piperidine-3-carbonyl)-piperidin-4-yl]-3-trifluoromethyl-benzoyl}-guanidine\n\n\n \n \n \nTo a vial containing Piperidine-1,3-dicarboxylic acid 1-tert-butyl ester (32 mg, 0.14 mmol) is added 2-(7-aza-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (38 mg, 0.1 mmol) followed by N,N-dimethylacetamide (0.5 mL). The vial is shaken at room temp for ˜15 minutes. To a separate suspension of the product from Step E (40 mg, 0.089 mmol) in N,N-dimethylacetamide (0.5 mL) is added N-methylmorpholine (20 μL, 0.18 mmol) and the resulting solution is added to the carboxylic acid containing mixture. The mixture is then shaken at room temp for 16 hours. The resulting solution is filtered through an SPE cartridge containing 500 mg of basic alumina to remove the coupling reagent byproducts and any excess acid. The reaction vial is then rinsed with 10:1 N,N-dimethylacetamide:methanol (3×500 μL) and each rinse is used to wash the alumina plug. The resulting yellow solution is evaporated in the Genevac. The residue obtained is dissolved in dichloromethane (1 mL) and 20% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane (1 mL) is added. The resulting solution is shaken overnight at room temperature. The resulting mixture is evaporated and the residue is purified by HPLC to afford the desired product (23 mg, 60%).

using the assays described below.\n\n\n \n \nEvaluation of NHE-1 Inhibition (pHi)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nHT-29 cells resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% NEAA, and 1% Penn-Strep are seeded at 10,000 cells/well in collagen coated 384 well plates which are then incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. The next day, the medium is removed and the cells are dye (Invitrogen's BCECF) loaded for 30 minutes at 37° C., washed three times with an acid loading buffer (10 mM NH\n4\nCl, 1.8 mM CaCl\n2\n, 90 mM Choline Cl, 5 mM Glucose, 15 mM Hepes, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl\n2\n, adjusted to pH 7.5 with KOH) and further incubated at RT for 30 minutes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the end of the incubation, the buffer is removed and 5 uL of fresh acid loading buffer is added to each well to prevent the dessication of the cells. The plate is placed in a Hamamatsu FDSS6000 instrument and candidate compounds are added to the cells. The plates are read and the compound 1050's are calculated as measurements of the 50% inhibition of the intracellular pH recovery.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred compounds will have an 1050 of <400 nM.\n\n\n \n \nEvaluation of Functional Potency in Human Platelets (hPSA)\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBlood (Human) was collected into 10 ml K\n2 \nEDTA tubes (BD, #366643) at room temperature and centrifuged at 150 g for 10 minutes at room temperature and platelet rich plasma (PRP) that comprised the upper two-thirds of the plasma layer was used for the assessment of platelet swelling. The remaining plasma was further centrifuged at 1400×g to obtain platelet poor plasma (PPP). 24 μl test compounds(10×) and vehicle controls were added to 96 well plates to which 28 μl/well PRP was then added 172 μl/well of Propionate medium (PM), (sodium propionate 140 mM, HEPES 20 mM, glucose 10 mM, KCL 5 mM, MgCl\n2 \n1 mM and CaCl\n2 \n1 mM; pH6.7) was placed into 96 well plates to initiate platelet swelling. Platelet swelling was measured as a decrease in optical density at 680 mM measured ever 6 seconds over 5 mM using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices VMAX). Slope values were calculated and POC was calculated using the changes in slope from control values.\n\n\n \nTherapeutic Use\n\n\n \n \n \nAs can be demonstrated by the assays described above, the compounds of the invention are useful in inhibiting the NHE-1. Compounds of formula I are therefore useful in the treatment of acute responses to organ (e.g., myocardial, hepatic, cerebral) injury and are furthermore useful in the treatment of chronic post-infarct, hypertension-, and age-related responses resulting in the development of heart failure. They can be used in patients as drugs, particularly in the form of pharmaceutical compositions as set forth herein.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn another aspect of the invention, the present compounds my be useful in treating the following additional indications: acute and chronic inflammation in the lung caused by inhalation of smoke, endometriosis, Behcet's disease, uveitis and ankylosing spondylitis, pancreatitis, Lyme disease, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, septic shock, osteoarthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, psoriasis, graft versus host disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, restenosis following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, diabetes, toxic shock syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, acute and chronic pain, contact dermatitis, atherosclerosis, traumatic arthritis, glomerulonephritis, reperfusion injury, sepsis, bone resorption diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, stroke, thermal injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ injury secondary to trauma, dermatoses with acute inflammatory components, acute purulent meningitis, necrotizing enterocolitis and syndromes associated with hemodialysis, leukopherisis and granulocyte transfusion.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFinally, there is an ever growing body of evidence that different fields of cancer research, from etiopathogenesis, cancer cell metabolism and neovascularization, to multiple drug resistance (MDR), selective apoptosis, modern cancer chemotherapy and the spontaneous regression of cancer (SRC) all appear to have in common a pivotal characteristic, the aberrant regulation of hydrogen ion dynamics. Thus, cancer cells have an acid-base disturbance that is completely different than observed in normal tissues and that increases in correspondence with increasing neoplastic state: an interstitial acid microenvironment linked to an intracellular alkalosis. In addition, its anti-cytokine/anti-inflammation actions stated above added to the benefit in cancer. Therefore, a list of cancer indications include: breast cancer, colon/colorectal cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and prostate cancer\n\n\n \n \n \n \nBesides being useful for human treatment, these compounds are also useful for veterinary treatment of companion animals, exotic animals and farm animals, including mammals, rodents, and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor treatment of the above-described diseases and conditions, a therapeutically effective dose will generally be in the range from about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg/kg of body to weight per dosage of a compound of the invention; preferably, from about 0.1 mg to about 20 mg/kg of body weight per dosage. For example, for administration to a 70 kg person, the dosage range would be from about 0.7 mg to about 7000 mg per dosage of a compound of the invention, preferably from about 7.0 mg to about 1400 mg per dosage. Some degree of routine dose optimization may be required to determine an optimal dosing level and pattern. The active ingredient may be administered from 1 to 6 times a day.\n\n\n \nGeneral Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions\n\n\n \n \n \nWhen used as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the invention are typically administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Such compositions can be prepared using procedures well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one compound of the invention. The compounds of the invention may also be administered alone or in combination with adjuvants that enhance stability of the compounds of the invention, facilitate administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing them in certain embodiments, provide increased dissolution or dispersion, increased inhibitory activity, provide adjunct therapy, and the like. The compounds according to the invention may be used on their own or in conjunction with other active substances according to the invention, optionally also in conjunction with other pharmacologically active substances. In general, the compounds of this invention are administered in a therapeutically or pharmaceutically effective amount, but may be administered in lower amounts for diagnostic or other purposes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAdministration of the compounds of the invention, in pure form or in an appropriate pharmaceutical composition, can be carried out using any of the accepted modes of administration of pharmaceutical compositions. Thus, administration can be, for example, orally, buccally (e.g., sublingually), nasally, parenterally, topically, transdermally, vaginally, or rectally, in the form of solid, semi-solid, lyophilized powder, or liquid dosage forms, such as, for example, tablets, suppositories, pills, soft elastic and hard gelatin capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, or aerosols, or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable for simple administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical compositions will generally include a conventional to pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound of the invention as the/an active agent, and, in addition, may include other medicinal agents, pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, diluents, vehicles, or combinations thereof. Such pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers, or additives as well as methods of making pharmaceutical compositions for various modes or administration are well-known to those of skill in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs one of skill in the art would expect, the forms of the compounds of the invention utilized in a particular pharmaceutical formulation will be selected (e.g., salts) that possess suitable physical characteristics (e.g., water solubility) that is required for the formulation to be efficacious."
