It has been known that PGE\n2\n possesses cyto-protective activity, uterine contractive activity, a pain-inducing effect, a promoting effect on digestive peristalsis, an awakening effect, a suppressive effect on gastric acid secretion, hypotensive activity and diuretic activity and so on.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA recent study has proved existence of various PGE subtype receptors possessing a different physical role from each other. At present, four receptor subtypes are known and they are called EP\n1\n, EP\n2\n, EP\n3\n, and EP\n4\n (\nNegishi M., et al., J. Lipid Mediators Cell Signaling, 12, 379-391 (1995\n)).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is thought that EP\n4\n subtype receptor relates to inhibition of producing TNF-α and acceleration of producing IL-10. Therefore, the compounds which can bind on EP\n4\n subtype receptor are expected to be useful for the prevention and/or treatment of immunological diseases (autoimmune diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis, Sjoegren's syndrome, chronic rheumarthrosis and systemic lupus erythematosus \netc.,\n and rejection after organ transplantation \netc\n.), asthma, neuronal cell death, arthritis, lung failure, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary emphysema, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver damage, acute hepatitis, nephritis (acute nephritis, chronic nephritis), renal insufficiency, hypertension, myocardiac ischemia, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis, hemophagous syndrome, macrophage activation syndrome, Still's disease, Kawasaki disease, burn, systemic granulomatosis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, hypercytokinemia at dialysis, multiple organ failure, and shock \netc.\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also thought that EP\n4\n subtype receptor relates to protecting of mucosa. Therefore, the compounds which can bind on EP\n4\n subtype receptor are expected to be useful for the prevention and/or treatment of ulcer of gastrointestinal tract such as gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer \netc.\n and stomatitis. It is also thought that EP\n4\n subtype receptor relates to hair growth function. Therefore, the compounds which can bind on EP\n4\n subtype receptor are expected to be useful for the prevention and/or treatment of hair-disadvantaged and alopecia. Furthermore, it is also thought that EP\n4\n subtype receptor relates to maturation of cervix. Therefore, the compounds which can bind on EP\n4\n subtype receptor are expected to be useful for the promoter of maturation of cervix.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, the compounds which can bind on EP\n4\n subtype receptor also have an action of accelerating bone formation, so it is expected to be useful for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases associated with decrease in bone mass, for example,\n\n \n \n \n1) primary osteoporosis (e.g., primary osteoporosis followed by aging, postmenopausal primary osteoporosis, primary osteoporosis followed by ovariectomy \netc.\n),\n \n2) secondary osteoporosis (e.g., glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism-induced osteoporosis, immobilization-induced osteoporosis, heparin-induced osteoporosis, immunosuppressive-induced osteoporosis, osteoporosis due to renal failure, inflammatory osteoporosis, osteoporosis followed by Cushing's syndrome, rheumatoid osteoporosis \netc.\n),\n \n3) bone diseases such as bone metastasis of cancer, hypercalcemia, Paget's disease, bone loss (alveolar bone loss, mandibular bone loss, childhood idiopathic bone loss \netc.\n), osteonecrosis \netc.\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nBesides treatment of the above diseases, the present invention also includes a pharmaceutical composition for accelerating bone formation after bone operation (e.g., bone formation after fractures, bone formation after bone grafting, bone formation after operation of artificial joint, bone formation after spinal fusion and bone formation after the other operation for bone regeneration \netc.\n), or promoting treatment thereof, or alternative treatment for bone grafting.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt is also thought that EP\n4\n subtype receptor relates to induction of physiological sleeping and suppression of blood platelet aggregation, so such compounds are expected to be useful for the prevention and/or treatment of sleep disorder and thrombosis\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound which can bind an EP\n4\n receptor selectively do not have inducing pain which may be caused by EP\n1\n, uterine relaxation which may be caused by EP\n2\n and uterine contraction which may be caused by EP\n3\n, so they are thought to be agents having no effect on the above actions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the specification of United State Patent No.\n \n4,177,346\n \n, it is disclosed that the compound of formula (A)\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n(wherein Q\nA\n is selected from the group consisting of -COOR\n3A\n, tetrazol-5-yl and -

Therefore it is unproved that topical administration of the EP\n4\n receptor agonist is useful for treatment of diseases associated with bone experimentally.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFour PGE\n2\n subtype receptors possessing a different physical role from each other exist, and each subtype is called EP\n1\n, EP\n2\n, EP\n3\n, and EP\n4\n and has a different pharmacological action. So the compounds which can bind on EP\n4\n subtype receptor selectively and binds on the other subtype receptors weakly may be the drug with less side effect, because they show no any other activities. Therefore it is in need of finding the drug like this.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOn the other hand, a lot of compounds which have the EP\n4\n agonistic activity are found until now. However, all of them have a prostanoid skeleton, so it is thought that they influence circulatory system (e.g. blood pressure lowered or increasing of the heart rate), or cause side-effect such as diarrhea when they are administered by systemic administration such as oral administration or intravenous infusion. Therefore, they have significant problem that there is a limitation of the dose that can be administered safely.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a disease associated with EP\n4\n agonist, a lot of studies of diseases associated with decrease in bone mass have been done. It is also thought that systemic administration causes side-effects, so development of the drug with less side effects is expected. Finding a long-acting pharmaceutical which can be administrated topically is also expected.\n\n\n \nDISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present inventors have studied to find out the compounds which can bind on EP\n4\n subtype receptor specifically, and which have strong agonistic activity. Finally, the compounds of formulae (1-2) and (1-3) were found out to meet this purpose, and this invention was accomplished.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present inventors found out the compound which binds on both EP\n4\n and EP\n2\n subtype receptor. The compound which binds on both EP\n4\n and EP\n2\n subtype receptor is expected additive or multiplier effect when treatment of the disease associated with both subtype receptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe present inventors also thought that we can create the therapeutic agent (treatment of diseases associated with decrease in bone mass, particularly) with no side-effect in systemic administration if EP\n4\n agonist can be administered topically. We also conceived that we can create the therapeutic agent (treatment of diseases associated with decrease in bone mass, particularly) with no side-effect in systemic administration and with less frequency of administration if we can find the EP\n4\n agonist which can be a sustained release formulation and which can be administered topically.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nTherefore the present inventors made further investigation to solve the former purpose to find that the purpose of the present invention can be accomplished by using a sustained release formulation of the compound of formulae (I-1),

For example, the in vivo degradable polymer may be used in an amount of from about 0.2 to 10,000 times, preferably from about 1 to 1,000 times, more preferably from about 1 to 100 times (by weight) that of the physiologically active material.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of the process for the preparation of microspheric, microcapsuled and nanospheric preparations include submerged drying method (e.g., o/w method, w/o method, w/o/w method), phase separation method, spray drying method, granulation method by ulractritical fluid, and methods analogous thereto.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe submerged drying method (o/w method) and spray drying method will be further described hereinafter. (1) In the submerged drying method (o/w method), a solution of an in vivo degradable polymer in an organic solvent is prepared at first. The organic solvent to be used in the preparation of the microspheric, microcapsuled and nanospheric preparations preferably has a boiling point of 120°C or less. Examples of the organic solvent employable herein include halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g., dichloromethane, chloroform), aliphatic esters (e.g., ethyl acetate), ethers, aromatic hydrocarbons, and ketones (e.g., acetone). These compounds may be used in admixture of two or more at a proper ratio. Preferred among these organic solvents are dichloromethane and acetonitrile, particularly dichloromethane. The concentration of the in vivo degradable polymer in the organic solution depends on the molecular weight of the in vivo degradable polymer, the kind of the organic solvent, etc. but is normally predetermined to be from about 0.01 to 80% (v/w), preferably from about 0.1 to 70% (v/w), more preferably from about 1 to 60% (v/w).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound represented by formula (I-1), (I-2) or (1-3) is then added to and dissolved in the solution of the in vivo degradable polymer in an organic solvent thus obtained, optionally in combination with other pharmaceutical preparations. The amount of the compound represented by formula (I-1), (I-2) or (I-3) to be added optionally in combination with the other pharmaceutical preparations depends on the kind of the pharmaceutical preparations to be added, the action of the pharmaceutical preparations in osteogenesis, the duration of the action, etc. but is normally from about 0.001% to 90% (w/w), preferably from about 0.01% to 80% (w/w), more preferably from about 0.3 to 30% (w/w) as calculated in terms of concentration in the solution of in vivo degradable polymer in an organic solvent.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSubsequently, the organic solution thus prepared is added to an aqueous phase which is then processed by an agitator, emulsifier or the like to form an o/w emulsion. The volume of the aqueous phase during this procedure is predetermined to be from about 1 to 10,000 times, preferably from about 2 to 5,000 times, particularly from about 5 to 2,000 times that of the oil phase. An emulsifier may be added to the aqueous phase which is an external phase. As such an emulsifier there may be normally used any material capable of forming a stable o/w emulsion. Examples of the emulsifier employable herein include anionic surface active agents, nonionic surface active agents, polyoxyethylene castor oil derivatives, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose, lecitine, and gelatin. These compounds may be used in proper combination. The concentration of the emulsifier in the external aqueous phase is preferably from about 0.001% to 20% (w/w), more preferably from about 0.01% to 10% (w/w), particularly from about 0.05% to 5% (w/w).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe evaporation of the solvent which is an oil phase can be accomplished by any commonly used method. In some detail, the evaporation of the solvent may be effected at ordinary pressure or gradually falling pressure with stirring by an agitator, magnetic stirrer or the like or may be effected while the pressure is being adjusted using a rotary evaporator. The microspheric preparation thus obtained is then fractionated by centrifugal separation or filtration. The microspheric preparation is washed with a surface active agent solution, alcohol or the like several times to remove the free compound represented by formula (I-1), (1-2) or (1-3), optionally in combination with other pharmaceutical preparations, and the emulsifier from the surface thereof, again dispersed in distilled water or a dispersant containing a vehicle (e.g., mannitol, sorbitol, lactose), and then freeze-dried. In the aforementioned o/w method, the microspheric preparation may be prepared by a method involving the dispersion of the compound represented by formula (I-1), (I-2) or (1-3) in a solvent of an in vivo degradable polymer in an organic solvent, optionally in combination with other pharmaceutical preparations, i.e., s/o/w method.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n(2) In order to prepare the microspheric preparation by the spray drying method, an organic solvent or emulsion having the in vivo degradable polymer and the compound represented by formula (I-1), (I-2) or (I-3), optionally in combination with other pharmaceutical preparations, dissolved therein is sprayed into the drying chamber of a spray dryer (spray dryer) through a nozzle so that the organic solvent or water in the atomized droplets is evaporated in an extremely short period of time to prepare a microspheric preparation. Examples of the nozzle employable herein include two liquid nozzle, pressure nozzle, and rotary disc. It is useful to spray an organic solvent or an aqueous solution of an aggregation inhibitor (e.g., mannitol, lactose, gelatin) at the same time with the spray of o/w emulsion as necessary for the purpose of inhibiting the aggregation of microspheres. The microspheric preparation thus obtained is then put under reduced pressure optionally under heating to remove water and solvent therefrom.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nExamples of the film-like preparation include film-like material obtained by dissolving the aforementioned in vivo degradable polymer and compound represented by formula (I-1), (I-2) or (I-3), optionally in combination with other pharmaceutical preparations, in an organic solvent, and then subjecting the solution to evaporation to dryness and gelled material obtained by dissolving the aforementioned in vivo degradable polymer and compound represented by formula (I-1), (1-2) or (I-3), optionally in combination with other pharmaceutical preparations, in a proper solvent, and then adding a granulating agent (e.g., cellulose, polycarbonate) to the solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe microsphere, microcapsule and nanosphere of the invention may be used as they are. Alternatively, a spherical, rod-like, acicular, pelletized, film-like or cream-like pharmaceutical composition may be processed as a starting material to provide preparations in various forms.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, this preparation may be used as a parenteral for local administration (e.g., injection, solid agent such as embedding agent, pellet and powder, liquid agent such as suspension, ointment, etc. to be administered to intramuscular, subcutaneous, organic or articular site). For example, in order to make an injection from the microspheric preparation, the microspheric preparation is suspended with a dispersant, a preservative, an isotonic agent, a buffer, a pH adjustor, \netc.\n to make an aqueous suspension as a practical preparation for injection. Alternatively, the microspheric preparation may be dispersed with a vegetable oil optionally in admixture with a phospholipid such as lecitine or with a middle-chain aliphatic acid triglyceride (e.g., Mygliol-812) to make an oil suspension as an injection which can be practically used.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe particle diameter of the microspheric preparation may be arbitrary so far as it suffices the desired dispersibility and passage through syringe if the preparation is used as a suspension for injection. By way of example, the average particle diameter of the microspheric preparation is from about 0.1 to 300 µm, preferably from about 1 to 150 µm, more preferably from about 2 to 100 µm. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention is preferably in the form of suspension as mentioned above. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention is also preferably in particulate form. This is because the pharmaceutical composition gives less excessive pain to patients when administered through a syringe for use in ordinary hypodermic or intramuscular injection. It is particularly preferred that the pharmaceutical composition of the invention be in the form of injection. Examples of the method for rendering the microspheric preparation aseptic include method which is aseptic throughout the entire steps, method involving sterilization by gamma rays, and method involving the addition of preservative. However, the invention is not limited to these methods.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmaceutical composition of the invention can be used for the treatment of bone diseases in which the amount of bone is decreased because the compound represented by formula (I-1), (I-2) or (1-3), optionally in combination with other pharmaceutical preparations, can be gradually released normally for 1 week to 3 months, though depending on the kind and added amount of the in vivo degradable polymer. Among these bone disease treatments, the treatment of fracture often requires that the affected part be fixed and covered with a plaster bandage and the administration of pharmaceutical preparations be conducted only once rather than frequently. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical preparations thus administered are required to accelerate treatment continuously. Thus, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention is useful particularly in this treatment.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dose of the pharmaceutical composition of the invention depends on the kind, content and form of the compound represented by formula (I-1), (I-2) or (I-3), optionally in combination with other pharmaceutical preparations, the duration of release of pharmaceutical preparations, the animal to be administered, etc., but may be the effective amount of the compound represented by formula (I-1), (1-2) or (1-3), optionally in combination with other pharmaceutical preparations. When administered to fracture as a microspheric preparation, for example, one time dose for adult (weight: 50 kg) is from about 0.001 mg to 500 mg, preferably from about 0.01 mg to 50 mg as calculated in terms of effective component. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be administered once 1 week to 3 months in the aforementioned amount.\n\n\n \nBEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION\n\n\n \n \n \nThe following Reference Examples and Examples are intend to illustrate, but not to limit the present invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe solvents in parentheses at chromatographic separations section show the developing or eluting solvents and the ratios of the solvents used are indicated by volume.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nWithout special explanation, NMR data was determined in CDCl\n3\n solution.

(FEES lett., 364, 339-341 (1995\n)), CHO cells which expressed mouse EP\n4\n receptor sub-types were prepared, inoculated on a 24-well microplate at 10\n5\n cells/well, and incubated for 2 days for use in the experiment. Each well was washed with 500 µl of MEM (minimum essential medium), added 450 µl of an assay medium (MEM containing 1 mmol/L of IBMX and 1% BSA), and incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes. Then, 50 µl of a solution containing PGE\n2\n alone or PGE\n2\n and a test compound was added to start the reaction, which was conducted at 37°C for 10 minutes and terminated with addition of 500 µl of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v). The reaction mixture was once treated by freezing (-80°C) and thawing, and the cells were removed with a scraper and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 3 minutes to give a supernatant, of which the AMP concentration was determined with a cAMP assay kit. That is, a buffer solution provided for the [\n125\nI]cAMP assay kit (Amersham) was added to 125 µl of the above supernatant to be 500 µl, which was mixed with 1 ml of 0.5 mol/L tri-n-octylamine/chloroform solution to eliminate trichloroacetic acid contained in the chloroform layer. The aqueous layer as a sample was measured to determined the cAMP amount contained in the sample according to the method as described in an instruction provided in the [\n125\nI]cAMP assay kit.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe agonistic effect (EC\n50\n value) of the compounds of the invention was determined by calculating 50% productivity of cAMP when the maximum effect of PGE\n2\n alone was regarded as 100%.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result, the compounds of the invention were found to have a significant and potent activity as EP\n4\n receptor agonist.\n\n\n \n(iii) Inhibitive Effect for TNF-α Production\n\n\n \n \n \nIn male SD rats, LPS (10 µg/2 ml/kg) was injected through the tail vein, and after a lapse of 90 minutes the blood was collected in a heparinized condition from the abdominal vena cava to prepare the plasma. The amount of TNF-α in the plasma was determined by an ELISA kit (Rat TNF-α Immunoassay kit; Biosource). The compound of the invention was dissolved in an equimolar amount of 0.02 mole/L sodium hydroxide solution, diluted with distilled water, and orally given 30 minutes before administration of LPS. The concentration at which the production of TNF-α was inhibited by 50% was regarded as the effective concentration (IC\n50\n) when the plasma TNF-α concentration in a control group (LPS-treated but no compound given) was 100%. As a result, the compound of the invention showed a significant effect for inhibition of TNF-α production.\n\n\n \n(iv) Inhibitive Effect for Chronic Articular Rheumatism\n\n\n(1) Arthritis induced by collagen in rats\n\n\n \n \n \nExperiment was performed according to the method of \nOsterman et al. (Inflamm. Res., 44, 258-263\n). An inducing agent (an emulsion prepared by adding an equal volume of physiological saline and 2 equivalent volume of incomplete Freund adjuvant to 0.3% solution of type II collagen of bovine origin) 0.1 ml each was applied intracutaneously to the 4 sites of the back of a female DA/Slc rat. After a lapse of 1 week, the same inducing agent was further applied intracutaneously to the tail root to induce arthritis. At 27 days the limbs were scored responding to the degree of redness and edema and assessed as 30 was regarded as full scores. The compound of the invention was dissolved in an equimolar amount of 0.02 mole/L sodium hydroxide solution, diluted with distilled water, and orally given 3 times a day from the next day of the first administration of inducer.\n\n\n \nResult:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of the compound of the invention for collagen-induced arthritis in rats is shown in Table 122.\n\n \nTable 122\n \n \n \nCompound\n \nDose\n \nArthritic Score (Means±SE)\n \n \n \n \nExample 2\n \nvehicle\n \n24.6±1.0\n \n \n \n1000 µg/kg\n \n17.3±1.5*\n \n \n \nExample 3 (b)\n \nvehicle\n \n24.6±1.0\n \n \n \n300 µg/kg\n \n19.3±1.4*\n \n \n \nExample 3 (1)\n \nvehicle\n \n27.0±1.2\n \n \n \n100 µg/kg\n \n16.3±3.0*\n \n \n \nExample 3 (kk)\n \nvehicle\n \n23.4±3.0\n \n \n \n100 µg/kg\n \n11.9±3.6*\n \n \n \nExample 4 (h)\n \nvehicle\n \n27.0±1.2\n \n \n \n300 µg/kg\n \n9.8±1.9*\n \n \n \n \n \n*: p<0.05\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result, significant improvement of the condition of arthritis and inhibition of the increase of limb volume (edema) were recognized by administration of the compounds of the invention in comparison with those of a control group (distilled water was orally given 3 times a day).\n\n\n \n(2) Arthritis induced by cocktail antibodies in mice\n\n\n \n \n \nA cocktail of antibodies to type II collagen was intravenously applied to male DBA/1JNCrj mice at a dose of 2 mg/0.5 ml/mouse. After a lapse of 3 days, lipopolysaccharide was intraperitoneally applied at a dose of 25 µg/0.1 ml/mouse to induce arthritis. At 10 days the limbs were respectively scored responding to the degree of redness and edema and assessed as 4 was regarded as full scores. The compound of the invention was dissolved in an equimolar amount of 0.02 mole/L sodium hydroxide solution, diluted with distilled water, and orally given 3 times a day from 30 minutes before the administration of lipopolysaccharide.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result, significant improvement of the condition of arthritis and inhibition of the increase of limb volume (edema) were recognized by administration of the compounds of the invention in comparison with those of a control group (distilled water was orally given 3 times a day).\n\n\n \n(v) Effect on the promotion of osteogenesis 1\n\n\n \n \n \nFemale SD rats (11 weeks of age; average weight 271 g) were employed in 5 rats for each group. Rat was cut open at the lateral abdomen under anesthetization with pentobarbital to remove the ovary and then sutured. In a sham group, incision and suture were made but no removal of the ovary was made.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFrom 6 days after the surgical operation, the compound of the invention (dissolved in an equimolar amount of 0.02 mole/L sodium hydroxide solution, and diluted with distilled water) were orally give 3 times a day for 2 months. To the control group and the sham group was given physiological saline. After termination of the test, the animals of each group were killed and subjected to autopsy. The bone density of the cancellous region of left thigh bone was measured by means of an apparatus for measuring the bone density of peripheral bone (XCT-960A, Norland/Stratech).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs a result, the compound of the invention significantly increased the bone density when compared with a control group (no administration).\n\n\n \n(vi) Effect on the promotion of osteogenesis 2\n\n\n \n \n \nUsing beagle/CSK dogs of approximately 6 months of age, the effect on the promotion of osteogenesis can be examined.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compound of the invention was dissolved in physiological saline and orally administered over 4 weeks. To a control group was give an equal volume of physiological saline. After completion of the administration, the dogs were killed, subjected to autopsy, and the area and density of bone were measured.\n\n\n \n(1) Measurement of bone area\n\n\n \n \n \nThe removed thigh bone was fixed with 10% buffered formalin solution and cut in round slices perpendicularly to the bone axis in 10 mm width at the center position of 25 mm from the trochlear fossa; the surface near the epiphysis was photographed with a camera at a certain distance, and the picture was sent into a computer to measure the bone surface by image analysis.\n\n\n \n(2) Measurement of bone density\n\n\n \n \n \nThe sample of 1 cm in width used in (1) was taken radiographs in side view, and the picture was sent into a computer to measure the radiation dose per unit area in the area of a certain width to obtain the bone density (Micro Focus X-Ray Enlargement Camera System µFX-1000 (FUJTFILM)).\n\n\n \n(vii) Effect of accelerating cure of bone fracture 1\n\n\n \n \n \nThis can be achieved according to the method of \nMarkel et al. (J. Bone and Joint Surgery, 73A, 914-923, 1991\n). Using beagle/CSK dogs of approximately 6 months of age, the femoral tibia is fractured under anesthesia and taken radiographs periodically for 3 months to assess the progress of cure. Thus, the effect of accelerating cure of bone fracture can easily be judged. The compound of the invention is orally administered everyday. To a control group is given distilled water. When the effect of acceleration of cure is recognized, the tibia is removed and the bone density and strength can be measured to further assess quantitatively.\n\n\n \n(viii) Inhibitive effect for gastric ulcer\n\n\n \n \n \nTo SD rats was orally administered 20 mg/kg of indomethacin to induce gastric ulcer. After a lapse of 6 hours, the stomach was removed to measure the ulcerous area of mucosa. The compound of the invention was orally administered 30 minutes before administration of indomethacin. As a result, the compound of the invention significantly reduced the ulcerous area when compared to the control group (no administration).\n\n\n \n(ix) Effect of accelerating cure of bone fracture\n\n\n \n \n \nAccording to the methods of \nR. Sakai (Bone, 25, 191-196 (1999\n)), \nH. Kawaguchi (Endocrinology, 135, 774-781 (1994\n)) and \nT. Hoshino (J. Biomed Mater Res., 51, 229-306 (2000\n)), a bone fracture model was prepared with male IGS rats of 8 weeks of age. Hair of the left hind-limb of a rat was cut under anesthetization with pentobarbital Na, and Viccillin S 500 (500 mg potency) (Meiji Seika) was intramuscularly injected at a dose of 10 mg potency/100 µl distilled water/body. Then, the skin on the fibula (from the back of knee joint to tendo Achillis) was incised to ablate the muscular tissue and expose the fibula. The fibula was cut off approximately at the central position to make a fracture portion, which was then restored to its former condition, and the incised portion was closed by suture with disinfection by iodine tincture/disinfectant ethanol. After making the fracture portion and before closing the wound of operation, a physiological saline solution containing 0.2% Tween 80 microsphere (containing 0.3 mg/kg as an active drug; about 60 µl) prepared in Formulation Example 3(1) was added only once. In addition, Compound (1) as a control for comparison was infused continuously for 2 hours twice a day through a catheter attached to the carotid artery. This was made until the last day of the experiment. At the 21 st day of the experiment, the rats were subjected to euthanasia with CO\n2\n, and the connective tissue of the hind-limbs, including muscle, was eliminated to obtain both of the fibulae. The recovered fibulae were taken radiographs to assess development of the cure of fracture based on the presence of a fracture line and callus formation, and the density and strength of the bone around the fracture portion were measured.\n\n\n \n(1) Measurement of the bone density of the callus region using a micro focus X-ray enlargement camera system\n\n\n \n \n \nThe bone density of the callus region at the fracture position of the recovered fibula was measured referring to the reports of \nC. Matsumoto (Calcif Tissue Int, 55, 324-329 (1994\n)), \nKaoru Yamazaki (Nihon Rinsyo, 56, 1464-1468 (1998\n)), and \nKeiichi Nakagawa (Sentan Iryo, 4(6), (1996\n)). Radiophotographs were taken at 4 magnifications using a micro focus X-ray enlargement camera system (FUJIFILM)/imaging plate (BAS-IP MS 2025; FUJIFILM) in a radiation condition of 40 kV tube voltage, 100 µA tube current, and radiation time 5 seconds. During photographing, a phantom for quantitative analysis of bone salt for mice (Kyoto Kagaku Co.) was set together in order to make an analytical curve for measurement of bone density. The image was read by a Bio-imaging Analyzer BAS-1800 (FUJIFILM)/ Image Reader (FUJIFILM) and processed with an Image Gauge, ver.3.1.12 (FUJIFILM). Based on the fracture line (surface) as a callus region, the region of interest (hereinafter sometimes referred to as ROI) was set at the position of 3 mm in the remote direction (ankle) and in the proximal direction (knee) respectively to calculate the bone density of each ROI from the analytical curve obtained from the phantom for quantitative analysis of bone salt. The bone density of the callus region at the fracture side was calculated from the following equation and represented by means±standard error (mg/cm\n2\n). \n \n \nBone density in callus region\n \n=\n \n \n \n \nbone density in proximal callus region\n \n \n×\n \nA\n \n \n+\n \n \n \nbone density in remote callus region\n \n \n×\n \nB\n \n \n \n/\n \n \nA\n \n+\n \nB\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \nA represents the ROI area in the proximal callus region;\n \nB represents the ROI area in the remote callus region.\n \n\n\n(2) Measurement of the bone strength by a bending test at three points\n\n\n \n \n \nAccording to the report of \nT. Hoshino (J Biomed Mater Res., 51, 229-306 (2000\n)), a bending test at three points was performed. Using an Instron Universal Material Testing Machine Type 5544 (Instron Japan)/Merlin (Instron Japan; version 22043), fracture strength and energy absorption were measured in a condition of 2.5 mm/sec of bending rate and 10 mm of sample holder width. The bone strength data was calculated as relative strength of the non-fractured side versus the fractured side for the respective individuals and represented by means ± standard error (% of intact).\n\n\n \nResult:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe effect of accelerating cure of bone fracture when the fractured portion was treated only once with microsphere (containing 0.3 mg/kg as an active drug) prepared in Formulation Example 3(1) or a reference (physiological saline containing 0.2% Tween 80) is shown in Table 123.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of accelerating cure of bone fracture when the fractured portion was treated only once with microsphere (containing 1 mg/kg as an active drug) prepared in Formulation Example 3(3) or a reference (physiological saline containing 0.2% Tween 80) is shown in Table 123.\n\n \nTable 123\n \n \n \n \n \nBone Density (mg/cm\n2\n)\n \nFracture Strength (% of intact)\n \n \n \n \nFormulation Example 3(1)\n \n60.9±4.0\n \n149.8±12.4%\n \n \n \nReference (Control)\n \n39.8±2.7\n \n62.8±8.5%\n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nTable 124\n \n \n \n \n \nBone Density (mg/cm\n2\n)\n \nFracture Strength (% of intact)\n \n \n \n \nFormulation Example 3(3)\n \n51.6±3.8\n \n114.6±10.4%\n \n \n \nReference (Control)\n \n36.5±2.5\n \n55.3±5.7%\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe effect of accelerating cure of bone fracture when Compound (1) (50 ng/kg/min) and a reference (physiological saline) were administered intravenously for 2 hours twice a day for 21 days is shown in Table 125.\n\n \nTable 125\n \n \n \n \n \nBone Density (mg/cm\n2\n)\n \nFracture Strength (% of intact)\n \n \n \n \nCompound\n \n42.8±2.58\n \n30.4±12.4%\n \n \n \nReference (Control)\n \n35.2±1.91\n \n55.2±9.77%\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs clearly seen from Tables 123 and 124 in comparison with Table 125, the effect of accelerating cure of bone fracture when treated only once with microspheres which were prepared in Formulation Examples 3(1) and 3(3) were much higher than that of Compound (1) which was administered intravenously for 21 days.\n\n\n \n(x) Inhibitive effect on ulcerous colitis\n\n\n \n \n \n7% Sodium dextran sulfate aqueous solution (hereinafter abbreviated to as SDS) was given freely to male C57BL/6 mice.

The clinical score was calculated as the sum of diarrhea score (normal: 0; soft: 2; diarrhea: 4) and hematochezia (normal: 0; bleeding: 2; heavy bleeding: 4). At 10 days after taking of the SDS aqueous solution, the blood was collected from the vena cava under ethereal anesthesia in the presence of heparin, and the hematocrit value was measured by a hemocytometer. During a period of from 0 day to 10th day after taking of the SDS aqueous solution, the compound of the invention was orally administered twice a day at a dose of 10, 30, 100 or 300 µg/10 ml/kg. As a result, the compound of the invention showed a significant inhibitive effect on ulcerous colitis."
