Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates to imidazole derivatives of the general formula\n\n \n \n\nwherein\n\n \n \n \nR\n1\n \n \nsignifies halogen, lower alkyl, CF\n3\n, CF\n2\nH or cyano;\n \nR\n2\n \n \nsignifies lower alkyl;\n \nR\n3\n \n \nsignifies heteroaryl, selected from the group consisting of pyrimidinyl, pyridinyl, pyridazinyl, furanyl or pyrazinyl, which is optionally substituted by one, two or three substituents, selected from the group consisting of halogen, lower alkyl, lower alkyl-halogen, lower alkoxy, NR'R\" or by 1-morpholinyl, or by thiomorpholinyl, 1-oxo-thiomorpholinyl or 1,1-dioxo-thiomorpholinyl\n \nR', R\"\n \nare independently from each other hydrogen or lower alkyl;\n \nR\n4\n \n \nis hydrogen;\n \n\nas well as to pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.\n    \n \n \n \n \n \nWO 02/46166\n \n of which the Applicant is proprietor already discloses substituted imidazole derivatives as mGluR\n5\n antagonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has now surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Compounds of formula I are distinguished by having valuable therapeutic properties. They can be used in the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the central nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nGlutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays a unique role in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group, namely the ionotropic receptors, forms ligand-controlled ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) belong to the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein coupled receptors.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. According to their sequence homology, signal transduction mechanisms and agonist selectivity, these eight receptors can be sub-divided into three sub-groups:\n\n \n \n \nmGluR1 and mGluR5 belong to group I, mGluR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II and mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8 belong to group III.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nLigands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the first group can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as chronic and acute pain.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nOther treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are ischemia, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficiency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depressions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDisorders mediated full or in part by mGluR5 are for example acute, traumatic and chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and anxiety, depression, pain and drug dependency \n(\n \nExpert Opin.

This mixture is evacuated and backfilled with argon to remove oxygen from the solution. Triphenylphosphine and bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II)chloride are added and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for about 1 h. Copper(I)iodide and trimethylsilylacetylen are added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight. After purification the desired product of formula V is obtained.\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 2\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nSolution 1: The obtained compound of formula V, for example (3-chloro-phenylethynyl)-trimethyl-silane and 5-iodo-2-methyl-1H-imidazole (synthesis: \nM.D. Cliff, S.G. Pyne, Synthesis 1994, 681-682\n) are dissolved in dry THF and dry DMF. This mixture is evacuated and backfilled with argon to remove oxygen from the solution. Solution 2: Triphenylphosphine, bis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(II)chloride, copper(I)iodide and triethyl amine are dissolved in dry THF. This mixture was also evacuated and backfilled with argon to remove oxygen from the solution.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSolution 2 is heated to about 40 °C and solution 1 is added dropwise. The reaction mixture is heated to about 60 °C and tetrabutylammonium fluoride solution is added dropwise. The reaction is than stirred at room temperature overnight. After purification the desired product of formula II is obtained. This material which still contained tetrabutylammonium salts is used without any further purification for the next step.\n\n\n \n\n\nStep 3\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe compound of formula II, for example 4-(3-chloro-phenylethynyl)-2-methyl-1H-imidazole is dissolved in dimethyl formamide. Potassium carbonate and a compound of formula III, for example 2-chloro-pyrimidine are added and the reaction mixture is stirred at about 80 °C overnight. After work-up and purification the desired compound of formula I is obtained.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I can be manufactured readily according to methods known per se and taking into consideration the nature of the compound to be converted into a salt. Inorganic or organic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula I. Compounds which contain the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, for example sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or the like, basic amines or basic amino acids are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of acidic compounds.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, as already mentioned above, metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and can be used for the treatment or prevention of mGluR5 receptor mediated disorders, such as acute and/or chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders and memory deficits, as well as acute and chronic pain. Treatable neurological disorders are for instance epilepsy, schizophrenia, anxiety, acute, traumatic or chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia, Huntington's chorea, ALS, multiple sclerosis, dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficient functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, ethanol addiction, nicotine addiction, psychoses, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depression. Other treatable indications are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are especially useful as analgesics. Treatable kinds of pain include inflammatory pain such as arthritis and rheumatoid disease, vasculitis, neuropathic pain such as trigeminal or herpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy pain, causalgia, hyperalgesia, severe chronic pain, post-operative pain and pain associated with various conditions like cancer, angina, renal or billiay colic, menstruation, migraine and gout.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor binding experiments, cDNA encoding human mGlu 5a receptor was transiently transfected into EBNA cells using a procedure described by Schlaeger and Christensen [\nCytotechnology 15:1-13 (1998\n)]. Cell membrane homogenates were stored at -80°C until the day of assay where upon they were thawed and resuspended and polytronised in 15 mM Tris-HCl, 120 mM NaCl, 100 mM KCl, 25 mM CaCl\n2\n, 25 mM MgCl\n2\n binding buffer at pH 7.4 to a final assay concentration of 20 µg protein/ well.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSaturation isotherms were determined by addition of twelve [\n3\nH]MPEP concentrations (0.04-100 nM) to these membranes (in a total volume of 200 µl) for 1 h at 4°C. Competition experiments were performed with a fixed concentration of [\n3\nH]MPEP (2nM) and IC\n50\n values of test compounds evaluated using 11 concentrations (0.3-10,000nM). Incubations were performed for 1 h at 4° C.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAt the end of the incubation, membranes were filtered onto unifilter (96-well white microplate with bonded GF/C filter preincubated 1 h in 0.1% PEI in wash buffer, Packard BioScience, Meriden, CT) with a Filtermate 96 harvester (Packard BioScience) and washed 3 times with cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 buffer. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 µM MPEP. The radioactivity on the filter was counted (3 min) on a Packard Top-count microplate scintillation counter with quenching correction after addition of 45 µl of microscint 40 (Canberra Packard SA., Zürich, Switzerland) and shaking for 20 min.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor functional assays, [Ca\n2+\n]i measurements were performed as described previously by \nPorter et al. [Br. J. Pharmacol. 128:13-20 (1999\n)] on recombinant human mGlu 5a receptors in HEK-293 cells. The cells were dye loaded using Fluo 4-AM (obtainable by FLUKA, 0.2µM final concentration). [Ca\n2+\n]i measurements were performed using a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices Corporation, La Jolla, CA, USA). Antagonist evaluation was performed following a 5 min preincubation with the test compounds followed by the addition of a submaximal addition of agonist.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe inhibition (antagonists) curves were fitted with a four parameter logistic equation giving IC\n50\n, and Hill coefficient using an iterative non linear curve fitting software (Xcel fit).\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor binding experiments the Ki values of the compounds tested are given. The Ki value is defined by the following formula: \n \n \n \nK\n \ni\n \n \n=\n \nI\n \n⁢\n \n \nC\n \n50\n \n \n/\n \n \n1\n \n+\n \nL\n \n/\n \n \nK\n \nd\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nin which the IC\n50\n values are those concentrations of the compounds tested which cause 50 % inhibition of the competing radioligand ([\n3\nH]MPEP). L is the concentration of radioligand used in the binding experiment and the K\nd\n value of the radioligand is empirically determined for each batch of membranes prepared.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of the present invention are mGluR 5a receptor antagonists. The activities of compounds of formula I as measured in the assay described above are in the range of Ki < 160 nM.\n\n \n \n \n \n \nExample No.\n \nKi (nM)\n \nExample No.\n \nKi (nM)\n \nExample No.\n \nKi (nM)\n \nExample No.\n \nKi (nM)\n \n \n \n \n1\n \n63\n \n9\n \n11\n \n26\n \n94\n \n35\n \n39\n \n \n \n2\n \n28\n \n20\n \n11\n \n27\n \n130\n \n38\n \n99\n \n \n \n3\n \n31\n \n22\n \n60\n \n31\n \n88\n \n39\n \n9\n \n \n \n8\n \n157\n \n25\n \n32\n \n33\n \n66\n \n40\n \n68\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragées, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for Example, as such as carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragées and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following examples are provided to further elucidate the invention:\n\n\n \n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2-[4-(3-Chloro-phenylethynyl)-2-methyl-imidazol-1-yl]-pyrimidine\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n4-(3-Chloro-phenylethynyl)-2-methyl-1H-imidazole (200 mg, 0.92 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL dimethyl formamide.

Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present disclosure relates to piperazine derivatives useful as selective CCR5 antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds, and methods of treatment using the compounds. The disclosure also relates to the use of a combination of a CCR5 antagonist of this disclosure and one or more antiviral or other agents useful in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The disclosure further relates to the use of a CCR-5 antagonist of this disclosure, alone or in combination with another agent, in the treatment of solid organ transplant rejection, graft v. host disease, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, asthma, allergies or multiple sclerosis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe global health crisis caused by HIV, the causative agent of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), is unquestioned, and while recent advances in drug therapies have been successful in slowing the progression of AIDS, there is still a need to find a safer, more efficient, less expensive way to control the virus.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIt has been reported that the CCR5 gene plays a role in resistance to HIV infection. HIV infection begins by attachment of the virus to a target cell membrane through interaction with the cellular receptor CD4 and a secondary chemokine co-receptor molecule, and proceeds by replication and dissemination of infected cells through the blood and other tissue. There are various chemokine receptors, but for macrophage-tropic HIV, believed to be the key pathogenic strain that replicates \nin vivo\n in the early stages of infection, the principal chemokine receptor required for the entry of HIV into the cell is CCR5. Therefore, interfering with the interaction between the viral receptor CCR5 and HIV can block HIV entry into the cell. The present disclosure relates to small molecules which are CCR5 antagonists.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCCR-5 receptors have been reported to mediate cell transfer in inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, asthma and allergies, and inhibitors of such receptors are expected to be useful in the treatment of such diseases, and in the treatment of other inflammatory diseases or conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, solid organ transplant rejection and graft v. host disease.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nRelated piperazine derivatives which are muscarinic antagonists useful in the treatment of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease are disclosed in \n \nUS patents 5,883,096\n \n; \n \n6,037,352\n \n; \n \n5,889,006\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \nA-M. Vandamme et al., Antiviral Chemistry & Chemotherapy, 9:187-203 (1998\n) disclose current clinical treatments of HIV-1 infections in man including at least triple drug combinations or so-called Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (\"HAART'); HAART involves various combinations of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (\"NRTI\"), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (\"NNRTI\") and HIV protease inhibitors (\"PI\"). In compliant drug-naive patients, HAART is effective in reducing mortality and progression of HIV-1 to AIDS. However, these multidrug therapies do not eliminate HIV-1 and long-term treatment usually results in multidrug resistance. Development of new drug therapies to provide better HIV-1 treatment remains a priority.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present disclosure relates to the treatment of HIV comprising administering to a mammal in need of such treatment an effective amount of a CCR5 antagonist represented by the structural formula I:\n\n \n \n\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein\n\nR is R\n8\n-phenyl, R\n8\n-pyridyl, R\n8\n-thiophenyl or R\n8\n-naphthyl;\n\nR\n1\n is hydrogen or C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl;\n\nR\n2\n is R\n9\n, R\n10\n, R\n11\n-phenyl; R\n9\n, R\n10\n, R\n11\n-substituted 6-membered heteroaryl; R\n9\n, R\n10\n, R\n11\n-substituted 6-membered heteroaryl N-oxide; R\n12\n, R\n13\n-substituted 5-membered heteroaryl; naphthyl; fluorenyl; diphenylmethyl\n\n \n \n\nR\n3\n is hydrogen, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, C\n3\n-C\n10\n cycloalkyl, C\n3\n-C\n10\n cycloalkyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, R\n8\n-phenyl, R\n8\n-phenyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, R\n8\n-naphthyl, R\n8\n-naphthyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, R\n8\n-heteroaryl or R\n8\n-heteroaryl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl;\n\nR\n4\n, R\n5\n, R\n7\n and R\n13\n are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)-alkyl;\n\nR\n6\n is hydrogen, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl or C\n2\n-C\n6\n alkenyl;\n\nR\n8\n is 1 to 3 substituents independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl, C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkoxy, -CF\n3\n, CF\n3\nO-, CH\n3\nC(O)-, -CN, CH\n3\nSO\n2\n-, CF\n3\nSO\n2\n-, R\n14\n-phenyl, R\n14\n-benzyl, CH\n3\nC(=NOCH\n3\n), CH\n3\nC(=NOCH\n2\nCH\n3\n),\n\n \n \n\n-NH\n2\n, -NHCOCF\n3\n, -NHCONH(C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl), -NHCO(C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl), -NHSO\n2\n(C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl), 5-membered heteroaryl and\n\n \n \n\nwherein X is -O-, -NH- or -N(CH\n3\n)-;\n\nR\n9\n and R\n10\n are independently selected from the group consisting of (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, halogen, -NR\n17\nR\n18\n, -OH, -CF\n3\n, -OCH\n3\n, -O-acyl, -OCF, and -Si(CH\n3\n)\n3\n;\n\nR\n11\n is R\n9\n, hydrogen, phenyl, -NO\n2\n, -CN, -CH\n2\nF, -CHF\n2\n, -CHO, -CH=NOR\n17\n, pyridyl, pyridyl N-oxide, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, -N(R\n17\n)CONR\n18\nR\n19\n, -NHCONH(chloro-(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl), -NHCONH((C\n3\n-C\n10\n)-cycloalkyl(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl), -NHCO(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, -NHCOCF\n3\n, -NHSO\n2\nN((C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl)\n2\n, -NHSO\n2\n(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, -N(SO\n2\nCF\n3\n)\n2\n, -NHCO\n2\n(C\n1\n-C\n5\n)alkyl, C\n3\n-C\n10\n cycloalkyl, -SR\n20\n, -SOR\n20\n, -SO\n2\nR\n20\n, -SO\n2\nNH(C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl), -OSO\n2\n(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, -OSO\n2\nCF\n3\n, hydroxy(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, -CON R\n17\nR\n18\n, -CON(CH\n2\nCH\n2\n-O-CH\n3\n)\n2\n, -OCONH(C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, -CO\n2\nR\n17\n, -Si(CH\n3\n)\n3\n or -B(OC(CH\n3\n)\n2\n)\n2\n;\n\nR\n12\n is (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkyl, -NH\n2\n or R\n14\n-phenyl;\n\nR\n14\n is 1 to 3 substituents independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n) alkyl, -CF\n3\n, -CO\n2\nR\n17\n, -CN, (C\n1\n-C\n6\n)alkoxy and halogen;\n\nR\n15\n and R\n16\n are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl, or R\n15\n and R\n16\n together are a C\n2\n-C\n5\n alkylene group and with the carbon to which they are attached form a spiro ring of 3 to 6 carbon atoms;\n\nR\n17\n, R\n18\n and R\n19\n are independently selected from the group consisting of H and C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl; and\n\nR\n20\n is C\n1\n-C\n6\n alkyl or phenyl.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPreferred are compounds of formula I wherein R is R\n8\n -phenyl or R\n8\n-naphthyl, especially wherein R\n8\n is a single substituent, and especially wherein the R\n8\n substituent is in the 4-position.

Double nucleoside combinations may lead to HIV- resistance and clinical failure in many patients.\n\n\n6. Most data obtained with saquinavir and ritonavir (each 400 mg bid).\n\n\n7. Zidovudine, stavudine or didanosine.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nAgents known in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, transplant and graft v. host disease, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis which can be administered in combination with the CCR5 antagonists of the present disclosure are as follows:\n\n \n \n \nsolid organ transplant rejection and graft v. host disease: immune suppressants such as cyclosporine and Interleukin-10 (IL-10), tacrolimus, antilymphocyte globulin, OKT-3 antibody, and steroids;\n \ninflammatory bowel disease: IL-10 (see \n \nUS 5,368,854\n \n), steroids and azulfidine;\n \nrheumatoid arthritis: methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, steroids and mycophenolate mofetil;\n \nmultiple sclerosis: interferon-beta, interferon-alpha, and steroids.\n \n\n\n \n \n \nCertain compounds of the disclosure may exist in different isomeric forms (e.g., enantiomers, diastereoisomers, atropisomers and rotamers). The disclosure contemplates all such isomers both in pure form and in admixture, including racemic mixtures.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain compounds will be acidic in nature, e.g. those compounds which possess a carboxyl or phenolic hydroxyl group. These compounds may form pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Examples of such salts may include sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, gold and silver salts. Also contemplated are salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable amines such as ammonia, alkyl amines, hydroxyalkylamines, N-methylglucamine and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCertain basic compounds also form pharmaceutically acceptable salts, e.g., acid addition salts. For example, the pyrido-nitrogen atoms may form salts with strong acid, while compounds having basic substituents such as amino groups also form salts with weaker acids. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other mineral and carboxylic acids well known to those in the art. The salts are prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in the conventional manner. The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous NaOH, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate. The free base forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the acid and base salts are otherwise equivalent to their respective free base forms for purposes of the disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAll Such acid and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the disclosure and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the disclosure.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds of the disclosure can be made by the procedures known in the art, for example by the procedures described in the following reaction schemes, by the methods described in the examples below, and by using the methods described in \n \nWO96/26196\n \n and \n \nWO98/05292\n \n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe following solvents and reagents may be referred to herein by the abbreviations indicated: tetrahydrofuran (THF); ethanol (EtOH); methanol (MeOH); acetic acid (HOAc or AcOH); ethyl acetate (EtOAc); N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF); trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT); m-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA); triethylamine (Et\n3\nN); diethyl ether (Et\n2\nO); dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO); and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride (DEC). RT is room temperature, and TLC is thin-layer chromatography. Me is methyl, Et is ethyl, Pr is propyl, Bu is butyl, Ph is phenyl, and Ac is acetyl.\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n\nReagents and conditions: a: R\n4\nCH(OSO\n2\nCF\n3\n)CO\n2\nCH\n3\n, base (e.g., K\n2\nCO\n3\n); b: CICH\n2\nCOCI; c: NH\n3\n; d: NaBH\n4\n-BF\n3\n; e: N-Boc-4-piperidone, NaBH(OAc)\n3\n; f: CF\n3\nCO\n2\nH; g: acylation; h: N-Boc-4-piperidone, Ti(OPr-i)\n4\n, Et\n2\nAICN; i: CH\n3\nMgBr.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nScheme 1\n, a benzylamine (\n1\n), wherein R and R\n3\n are as defined above and R\n1\n is hydrogen, is converted via (\n2\n) and (\n3\n) to the diketopiperazine (\n4\n), wherein R\n4\n is as defined above, which is reduced to the piperazine (\n5\n). Depending upon the desired R\n6\n substituent, this is processed in two ways. Reductive amination gives (\n6\n), which can be deprotected to (\n7\n) and finally acylated to the compounds of formula IA wherein R\n5\n and R\n6\n are H; alternatively, a modified Strecker reaction on (5) gives the aminonitrile (\n8\n), which, after treatment with methyl Grignard to give (\n9\n), deprotection to (\n10\n) and final N-acylation affords the compounds of formula IB wherein R\n5\n is H and R\n6\n is methyl. Acylation of (\n7\n) and (\n10\n) is carried out under standard conditions, e.g., with a compound R\n2\nCOOH and reagents such as DEC and HOBT. Use of a chiral compound of formula 1, e.g., (S)-methyl 4-substituted benzylamine, and a chiral lactate in step \na\n, e.g., methyl (R)-lactate triflate, will result in chiral compounds of formulas IA and IB.\n\n \n \n\nReagents: j: oxaborazolidine, BH\n3\n; k: CH\n3\nSO\n2\nCl, base; I: CF\n3\nCO\n2\nH.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn \nScheme 2\n, the compounds are prepared by an alkylation process on a pre-formed piperazine derivative. For example, preferred compounds with the S,S stereochemistry may be obtained in this way by chiral reduction of a ketone (\n11\n) to the alcohol (\n12\n), activation as the mesylate, and displacement with inversion by treatment with a suitable piperazine, which may either be mono-protected, in which case final elaboration requires deprotection followed by the steps described in (\ne\n) - (\ng\n) in Scheme 1 to obtain IC, or may be elaborated prior to the displacement step, in which case the final steps are (\nf\n) and (\ng\n) (deprotection and acylation) as in Scheme 1 to obtain ID.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor compounds where R\n3\n and R\n1\n are each H, either the alkylation route of Scheme 2 or a reductive amination method as typified in Scheme 3 can be used.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nFor diaryl compounds, wherein R and R\n3\n are each aryl, an alkylation method as typified in Scheme 4 is preferrred.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nPiperazines of formula 14, especially those wherein R\n3\n is C\n2\n-C\n6\n alkyl or benzyl, may also be obtained by a process wherein the\n\n \n \n\nportion is introduced as shown above by an alkylation-decyanation sequence. The reaction is exemplified for compounds wherein R is CF\n3\nO-phenyl, R\n1\n is hydrogen, R\n3\n is ethyl and R\n4\n is methyl, but using appropriate starting materials, other compounds of formula 14 can be similarly prepared.\n\n \n \n\nReagents: m: BOC\n2\nO, base; n: R\n6\nMgBr; o: CCl\n3\nCO\n2\nH, NaBH\n3\nCN; p: CF\n3\nCO\n2\nH; q: NaBH\n4\n, BF\n3\n.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nAs shown in Scheme 6, compounds bearing an additional alkyl group at R\n5\n on the piperazine ring may be prepared from the diketopiperazine intermediates (\n4\n) of Scheme 1. (\n4\n) is activated by conversion to the N(t-butoxycarbonyl) compound (\n17\n); addition of a Grignard reagent and sequential reduction, deprotection and lactam reduction provides (\n21\n), which can be used to prepare compounds of formula I in the manner described for intermediate (\n5\n) in Scheme 1.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nMany piperazines wherein R is R\n8\n-phenyl (or their Boc derivatives) shown in Scheme 1 can be obtained from a common intermediate, wherein R\n8\n is I. Several examples are shown in the above scheme, wherein R\n8\n is converted to Cl, CN, -C(O)NH\n2\n, H, Ph and p-ClC\n6\nH\n4\nCH\n2\n-. Detailed procedures for these conversions are provided in the examples below. The resultant piperazine or BOC-piperazine is then treated as shown in Scheme 1.\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSome compounds of the disclosure may be obtained by a Mannich method, as shown in the specific example of Scheme 8.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCompounds useful in this disclosure are exemplified by the following preparative examples, which should not be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure.

After 10 min., a solution of 2M borane-methyl sulfide complex (3 ml; 6 mmol) in THF was added dropwise over 5 min. TLC at the end of 30 min. showed that the starting material had been converted to a more polar product. The reaction was quenched with about 5 ml of CH\n3\nOH carefully until effervescence stopped; volatiles were removed in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n and washed with 1N HCl, water, 10% NaHCO\n3\n solution and brine. Concentration in vacuo gave 2g of a yellow gum. Flash silica gel chromatography (FSGC) using 10-20% EtOAc in hexanes furnished the desired chiral alcohol (1.6 g; 84%) as a colorless oil. TLC\n\nR\nf\n = 0.6 in 25% EtOAc:hexanes.\n\n\n \nStep 2:\n To a solution of the product of step 1 (1.55g; 8.16 mmol) in 10 ml of CH\n2\nCl\n2\n cooled in an ice bath were added Et\n3\nN (2.3 ml; 16.32 mmol) and CH\n3\nSO\n2\nCl (0.87 ml; 10.6 mmol) to form a turbid white solution. The reaction was quenched with water and the organic product was extracted with CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, washing with water, 1N HCl, 10% NaHCO\n3\n solution and brine. Concentration in vacuo gave the chiral mesylate (2.1g; 96%) as a pale yellow oil. TLC R\nf\n = 0.6 in 25% EtOAc:hexanes.\n\n\n \nStep 3:\n A solution of the product of step 2 (2.1g; 7.8 mmol), the N-BOC protected 2(S)-methyl piperazine (1.56g; 7.8 mmol - prepared from the reaction of commercial 2(S)-methyl piperazine with N-(tert-butoxy-carbonyloxy)phthalimide) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine (1.34 ml; 8 mmol) in 14 ml of dry CN\n3\nCN were heated at reflux until TLC indicated complete disappearance of the mesylate (16 h). The reaction mixture was cooled to RT, diluted with CH\n2\nCl\n2\n (50 ml) and washed with water (3 x 100 ml) and brine. The organic extract was dried over solid MgSO\n4\n and then concentrated to obtain 2.8 g of a yellow gum. FSGC (20% EtOAc in hexanes) served to isolate the desired (S,S)-diastereomer (1.5g; 52%) and its benzylic epimer, the (R,S)-diastereomer (0.5g; 17%) for a combined 69% yield. TLC R\nf\n = 0.75 (S,S) and 0.56 (R,S) in 25% EtOAc:hexanes.\n\n\n \nStep 4:\n TFA (6 ml) was added to a solution of the product of step 3 in 12 ml of CH\n2\nCl\n2\n and the resulting yellow-orange solution was stirred at RT for 8 h. The reaction was quenched by adding 1N NaOH solution to adjust the pH to 10. Extractive work up in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n gave 1.1 g of a yellow syrup. FSGC using 10% CH\n3\nOH in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n removed the less polar impurity and gradient elution with 1 % Et\n3\nN in 10% CH\n3\nOH:CH\n2\nCl\n2\n was needed to elute the desired free amine of the (S,S) diastereomer. Yield = 0.9g (75%). TLC R\nf\n = 0.5 in 10% CH\n3\nOH:CH\n2\nCl\n2\n.\n\n\n \nStep 5:\n A colorless solution of the product of step 4 (0.9g; 3.3 mmol), 4-piperidinone (0.86g; 4.3 mmol), NaB(OAc)\n3\nH (1.05g; 4.95 mmol) and glacial AcOH (80 µl) in 8 ml of CH\n2\nCl\n2\n was stirred at ambient temperature for a day. TLC indicated absence of starting material. The reaction mixture was diluted with 50 ml of CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, washed with 1N NaOH solution, water (2 x) and brine. The CH\n2\nCl\n2\n extract was dried over anhydrous MgSO\n4\n and concentrated to obtain 1.7g of yellow oil. FSGC (25% acetone in hexanes) was used to isolate the pure product (1.3g; 86%) as a white foam.

The reaction was cooled to RT, diluted with EtOAc and saturated aqueous NaHCO\n3\n. The EtOAc layer was removed, washed with water, dried with brine and evaporated to give a crude oil which was purified by preparative plate chromatography (2000 µM silica plates; 8:1 hexanes: EtOAc eluant), to give, after isolation of the appropriate band, the cyano intermediate (0.2 g) in 77% yield.\n\n\n \nStep 2\n: The product of Step 1 (0.2 g) was dissolved in MeOH (1.5 ml) and HCl (4M solution in 1,4-dioxane; 2 ml) was added.

This crude intermediate (0.038 g) and the product of Example 8, Step 3 (65 mg; trihydrochloride form) were treated in the same fashion as Example 8, Step 4, using DMF (2 ml), HOBt (45 mg), DEC (60 mg) and diisopropyl ethyl amine (0.1 ml) to give, after isolation and purification, the free base form of \n8AO,\n which was converted to its HCl salt (45 mg) in 95% yield.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBAP:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \nStep 1\n: 2,6-Dimethyl-4-formyl benzoic acid (1.96 g) (see 8W) was dissolved in t-butanol (94 ml) and 2-methyl-2-butene (24 ml). A solution of NaClO\n2\n (6.89 g), NaH\n2\nPO\n4\n monohydrate (8.17 g) and water (45 ml) was added dropwise to the first solution.

After heating at reflux for 1.5 h, the reaction was cooled to RT, poured into saturated NH\n4\nCl aqueous solution and extracted with Et\n2\nO. After evaporation, the crude reaction mixture was chromatographed on silica gel, eluting with 4:1 hexanes:EtOAc, to give, after evaporation of the appropriate fractions, the methylamine intermediate (0.8 g) in 38% yield.\n\n\n \nStep 2\n: The product of Step 1 (0.12 g), THF (5 ml) and EtNCO (54 mg) were heated at reflux for 17 h.

This solution was treated with a solution of sodium hexa-methyl disilazide in THF (1M; 26 ml) followed after 5 min with neat allyl bromide (6 ml). Upon removal of the bath and letting the reaction mixture warm to RT (∼1h), it changed from a yellow solution to dark reddish brown solution. The reaction was quenched with saturated NH\n4\nCl solution and the product extracted with EtOAc, washed with water, brine and dried. Concentration in vacuo afforded a brown semi solid. FSGC of this material using 25% Et\n2\nO in hexane as eluant gave 2.5 grams (92%) of the desired product as an amber gum (TLC R\nf\n = 0.65, 0.6 for two overlapping spots).\n\n\nStep 3:\n A solution of the product of Step 2 (2.4g) in CH\n3\nOH was treated with 10% Pd/C (0.2g) and placed under a balloon of H\n2\n gas. After stirring at RT for 4 h, the catalyst was removed via filtration through celite. Concentration of the filtrate yielded an amber gum.\n\n\nThe α-propyl nitrile obtained above was dissolved in CH\n3\nCN (12 ml). Magnesium bromide etherate (2.1 g; 8.14 mmol) and sodium triacetoxy borohydride (3.44 g; 16.2 mmol) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred at RT overnight. The reaction was quenched with water and rendered basic with saturated NaHCO\n3\n. The organic products were extracted with EtOAc and processed to obtain - 2 g of crude material. FSGC (10-25% Et\n2\nO in hexane) served to isolate two diasteromeric products (1.7g total; 79% for two steps):\n\n(S, S)-Diastereomer (\nA\n): TLC R\nf\n = 0.6 (25% Et\n2\nO-Hexane). 0.9 g of a colorless gum.\n\n(R, S)-Diastereomer (\nB\n): TLC R\nf\n = 0.5 (25% Et\n2\nO-Hexane). 0.8 g of a colorless gum.\n\n\n\nStep 4\n: Removal of the BOC-protecting group from the intermediate A was accomplished by treatment with TFA in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n. The isolated free piperazine (0.68g; 2.3 mmol), N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-piperidinone (0.45g; 2.3 mmol) and Ti(OiPr)\n4\n ( 0.7 mL; 2.5 mmol) were dissolved in 10 ml of CH\n2\nCl\n2\n and stirred overnight. Et\n2\nAlCN (1M in toluene; 2.7 ml) was introduced into the reaction mixture and the resultant solution was stirred for a day. The reaction was diluted with EtOAc and quenched with water. Celite was added to aid in the filtration of titanium and aluminum salts. The biphasic filtrate was washed with water, brine and dried. Concentration in vacuo yielded 1.1 g of a yellow gum (TLC R\nf\n = 0.55 in 25% EtOAc-hexane).\n\nThe resultant ipso-cyano compound was dissolved in dry THF (8 ml) and treated with a solution of CH\n3\nMgBr (3M in Et\n2\nO; 6 ml) and stirred overnight at RT. The reaction flask was placed in a cold water bath and carefully quenched with saturated NH\n4\nCl solution. The organic product was extracted with EtOAc and washed with water and brine. Concentration to a crude product which was purified by rapid FSGC (10-25% EtOAc in hexane) gave the BOC-piperidinyl compound as a pale yellow gum (1.1 g; 100%). TLC R\nf\n = 0.6 in 25% EtOAc-hexane.\n\n\nStep 5:\n The BOC-protecting group on the piperidine nitrogen in the product of Step 4 was removed by treatment with TFA in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n. Basification with I M NaOH and processing in CH\n2\nCl\n2\n afforded the unprotected piperidine in 90% yield.

This assay utilizes membranes prepared from NIH 3T3 cells expressing the human CCR5 chemokine receptor which have the ability to bind to RANTES, a natural ligand for the receptor. Using a 96-well plate format, membrane preparations are incubated with \n125\nI-RANTES in the presence or absence of compound for one hour. Compounds are serially diluted over a wide range of 0.001 ug/ml to 1 ug/ml and tested in triplicates. Reaction cocktails are harvested through glass fiber filters, and washed thoroughly. Total counts for replicates are averaged and data reported as the concentration required to inhibit 50 percent of total \n125\nI-RANTES binding. Compounds with potent activity in the membrane binding assay are further characterized in secondary cell-based HIV-1 entry and replication assays.\n\n\n \n\n\nHIV-1 Entry Assay:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nReplication defective HIV-1 reporter virions are generated by cotransfection of a plasmid encoding the NL4-3 strain of HIV-1 (which has been modified by mutation of the envelope gene and introduction of a luciferase reporter plasmid) along with a plasmid encoding one of several HIV-1 envelope genes as described by \nConnor et al , Virology, 206 (1995), p. 935-944\n. Following transfection of the two plasmids by calcium phosphate precipitation, the viral supernatants are harvested on day 3 and a functional viral titer determined. These stocks are then used to infect U87 cells stably expressing CD4 and the chemokine receptor CCR5 which have been preincubated with or without test compound. Infections are carried out for 2 hours at 37 °C, the cells washed and media replaced with fresh media containing compound. The cells are incubated for 3 days, lysed and luciferase activity determined. Results are reported as the concentration of compound required to inhibit 50% of the luciferase activity in the control cultures.\n\n\n \n\n\nHIV-1 Replication Assay:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThis assay uses primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells or the stable U87-CCR5 cell line to determine the effect of anti-CCR5 compounds to block infection of primary HIV-1 strains. The primary lymphocytes are purified from normal healthy donors and stimulated \nin vitro\n with PHA and IL-2 three days prior to infection. Using a 96-well plate format, cells are pretreated with drug for 1 hour at 37 °C and subsequently infected with an M-tropic HIV-1 isolates. Following infection, the cells are washed to remove residual inoculum and cultured in the presence of compound for 4 days. Culture supernatants are harvested and viral replication measured by determination of viral p24 antigen concentration.\n\n\n \n\n\nCalcium Flux Assay:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCells expressing the HIV coreceptor CCR5 are loaded with calcium sensitive dyes prior to addition of compound or the natural CCR5 ligand. Compounds with agonist properties will induce a calcium flux signal in the cell, while CCR5 antagonists are identified as compounds which do not induce signaling by themselves but are capable of blocking signaling by the natural ligand RANTES.\n\n\n \n\n\nGTPγS Binding Assay:\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nA GTPγS binding assay measures receptor activation by CCR5 ligands.\n\nThis assay measures the binding of \n35\nS labeled-GTP to receptor coupled G-proteins that occurs as a result of receptor activation by an appropriate ligand. In this assay, the CCR5 ligand, RANTES, is incubated with membranes from CCR5 expressing cells and binding to the receptor activation (or binding) is determined by assaying for bound \n35\nS label. The assay quantitatively determines if compounds exhibit agonist characteristics by inducing activation of the receptor or alternatively antagonist properties by measuring inhibition of RANTES binding in a competitive or non-competitive fashion.\n\n\n \n \nChemotaxis Assay\n:\n\n\n \n \n \nThe chemotaxis assay is a functional assay which characterizes the agonist vs. antagonist properties of the test compounds. The assay measures the ability of a non-adherent murine cell line expressing human CCR5 (BaF-550) to migrate across a membrane in response to either test compounds or natural ligands (i.e., RANTES, MIP-1β). Cells migrate across the permeable membrane towards compounds with agonist activity. Compounds that are antagonists not only fail to induce chemotaxis, but are also capable of inhibiting cell migration in response to known CCR5 ligands.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe role of CC chemokine receptors such as CCR-5 receptors in inflammatory conditions has been reported in such publications as \nImmunology Letters, 57, (1997), 117-120\n (arthritis); \nClinical & Experimental\n \nRheumatology, 17 (4) (1999), p. 419-425\n (rheumatoid arthritis); \nClinical & Experimental Immunology, 117 (2) (1999), p.237-243\n (atopic dermatitis); \nInternational Journal of Immunopharmacology, 20 (11) (1998), p. 661-7\n (psoriasis); \nJournal of Allergy & Clinical Immunology, 100 (6, Pt 2) (1997), p.
