Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField of the Invention\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe present invention relates generally to novel chemical compounds and methods. More particularly, the invention provides novel amino pyrrolopyrazole compounds and their analogs, having protein kinase activity, and methods of synthesizing and using such compounds.\n\n\n \n\n\nBackground\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nProtein kinases are a family of enzymes that catalyze phosphorylation of the hydroxyl groups of specific tyrosine, serine, or threonine residues in proteins. Typically, such phosphorylation can dramatically change the function of the protein and thus protein kinases can be pivotal in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular process, including metabolism, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and cell survival. The mechanism of these cellular processes provides a basis for targeting protein kinases to treat disease conditions resulting from or involving disorder of these cellular processes. Examples of such diseases include, but are not limited to, cancer and diabetes.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nProtein kinases can be broken into two types, protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and serine-threonine kinases (STKs). Both PTKs and STKs can be receptor protein kinases or non-receptor protein kinases. PAK is a family of non-receptor STKs. The p21-activated protein kinase (PAK) family of serine/threonine protein kinases plays important roles in cytoskeletal organization and cellular morphogenesis (\nDaniels et al., Trends Biochem. Sci. 24: 350-355 (1999\n); \nSells et al., Trends Cell. Biol. 7: 162-167 (1997\n)). PAK proteins were initially identified by their interaction with the active small GTPases, Cdc42, and Rac, and their homology to yeast kinase Ste20 (\nManser et al., Nature 367: 40-46 (1994\n)). In addition to mediating the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and cell adhesion by Cdc42 and Rac (\nDaniels et al., Trends Biochem. Sci. 24: 350-355 (1999\n)), it was determined that some PAK proteins protect cells from apoptosis (\nGnesutta et al., J. Biol.

Chem. 274: 31119-31122 (1999\n)). Through these diverse functions, PAK proteins regulate cell proliferation and migration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe full-length PAK4 nucleic acid and amino acid sequences are disclosed in \n \nU.S. Patent No. 6,013,500\n \n and have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers AF005046 (mRNA) and AAD01210 (amino acid). Modulation of human PAK4 activity is reported to result in alterations in cellular processes affecting cell growth and adhesion. For example, overexpression of PAK4 in fibroblasts leads to morphological changes that are characteristic of oncogenic transformation through induction of anchorage-independent growth and inhibition of apoptosis (\nGnesutta et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:14414-14419 (2001\n); \nQu et al., Mol. cell.

Such \"contacting\" can be accomplished \n\"in vitro,\"\n i.e., in a test tube, a petri dish or the like. In a test tube, contacting may involve only a compound and a PK of interest or it may involve whole cells. Cells may also be maintained or grown in cell culture dishes and contacted with a compound in that environment. In this context, the ability of a particular compound to affect a PK related disorder, i.e., the IC\n50\n of the compound, can be determined before use of compounds \nin vivo\n with more complex living organisms is attempted.

Over-activity of a PK refers to either amplification of the gene encoding a particular PK or production of a level of PK activity which can correlate with a cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth disorder (that is, as the level of the PK increases, the severity of one or more of the symptoms of the cellular disorder increases). Under-activity is, of course, the converse, wherein the severity of one or more symptoms of a cellular disorder increase as the level of the PK activity decreases.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Treat\", \"treating\" and \"treatment\" refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a PK mediated cellular disorder and/or its attendant symptoms.

The observed or detected effect can be a change in cell phenotype, in the catalytic activity of a PK or a change in the interaction of a PK with a natural binding partner. Techniques for observing or detecting such effects are well-known in the art. The effect is selected from a change or an absence of change in a cell phenotype, a change or absence of change in the catalytic activity of said protein kinase or a change or absence of change in the interaction of said protein kinase with a natural binding partner in a final aspect of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Cell phenotype\" refers to the outward appearance of a cell or tissue or the biological function of the cell or tissue. Examples, without limitation, of a cell phenotype are cell size, cell growth, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell survival, apoptosis, and nutrient uptake and use. Such phenotypic characteristics are measurable by techniques well-known in the art.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\"Natural binding partner\" refers to a polypeptide that binds to a particular PK in a cell. Natural binding partners can play a role in propagating a signal in a PK-mediated signal transduction process. A change in the interaction of the natural binding partner with the PK can manifest itself as an increased or decreased concentration of the PK/natural binding partner complex and, as a result, in an observable change in the ability of the PK to mediate signal transduction.\n\n\n \n\n\nDetailed Description\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of formulas I-VII can be made following the synthetic routes in Scheme 1 and Scheme 2. In Scheme 1 and Scheme 2 and the descriptions following, \"BOC\", \"Boc\" or \"boc\" means N-tert-butoxycarbonyl, DCM means CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, DIPEA (also known as Hunig's base) means diisopropyl ethyl amine, DMA means N,N-dimethylacetamide, \"DMF\" means dimethyl formamide, \"DMSO\" means dimethylsulfoxide, Et means -CH\n2\nCH\n3\n, \"MTBE\" means methyl t-butyl ether, NMP means 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, TEA means triethyl amine, TFA means trifluoro acetic acid, THF means tetrahydrofuran. While schemes \n1\n and \n2\n and the description refer to compound \nI\n, schemes \n1\n and \n2\n and the description are equally applicable to compounds \nII, III, IV, V, VI\n and \nVII.\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 1 illustrates the synthesis of the intermediate \nI(H)\n used to make compounds of formula I. The amino group of the substituted amino acid \nI(A)\n is alkylated to give compound \nI(B).\n This can typically be done by treating compound \nI(A)\n with an alkylating agent in the presence of a base. An activated electrophilic double bond moiety is a commonly used alkylating reagent. A typical reaction condition of alkylating \nI(A)\n with an activated electrophilic double bond moiety Is to treat \nI(A)\n with the activated double bond moiety in the presence of a strong base. Subsequent aqueous work up affords compound \nI(B).\n The amino group of compound \nf(B)\n Is then protected with a boc group to give compound \nI(C).\n This can typically be done by treating compound \nI(B)\n with Boc agent in the presence of a base. A typical condition is to treat compound \nI(B)\n with (Boc)\n2\nO in the presence of Me\n4\nNOH in MeCN as a solvent. The carboxylic acid group of compound \nI(C)\n is then converted into a methyl ester of compound \nI(D).\n A typical condition of converting the carboxylic acid group into the methyl ester group is to treat \nI(C)\n with methyl iodide in DMF in the presence of a base. Compound \nI(D)\n then undergoes an intramolecular aldol condensation to give compound \nI(F).\n This can typically be done by treating compound \nI(D)\n with a strong base in an aprotic solvent. A typical condition is to treat compound \nI(D)\n with t-BuOK in toluene. Subsequent aqueous workup gives compound \nI(F)\n. Compound \nI(F)\n then undergoes a 2+3 cyclization with a hydrazine moiety to form compound \nI(G).\n A typical condition of the cyclization is to reflux compound \nI(F)\n with hydrazine and acetic acid in EtOH. The free base pyrazole nitrogen of compound \nI(G)\n is then acylated to give compound \nI(H).\n A typical condition of the acylation is to treat compound \nI(G)\n with chloro ethyl carbonate in THF.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nMore detailed synthetic conditions of Scheme 1 can be found in \n \nU.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0171357\n \n and \n \nPCT Publication WO 02/12242\n \n, the disclosure of which are incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nScheme 2 illustrates two routes through which compounds of formula I can be made from intermediate \nI(H).\n In the first route of Scheme 2, the ethyl ester protecting group of the pyrazole nitrogen of \nI(H)\n is cleaved to give compound \nII(A).\n This reaction can typically be carried out by treating the substrate \nI(H)\n with a base. A typical reaction condition is to reflux the substrate \nI(H)\n in dioxane and DCM in the presence of 2-3 equivalents of LiOH followed by aqueous workup. Compound \nII(A)\n undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an electrophilic R\n1\n moiety to give compound \nII(B).\n This nucleophilic reaction can be alkylation, acylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination, and many other reactions that can be carried out for the pyrazole amino group of compound \nII(A).\n A typical alkylation condition for the transformation of \nII(A)\n to \nII(B)\n is to react \nII(A)\n with R\n1\n-Cl in the presence of excess base, such as DMA and TEA at an elevated temperature of 80 - 140 °C, and optionally under microwave radiation. Subsequent aqueous workup gives compound \nII(B).\n The Boc group on the pyrrole nitrogen of compound \nII(B)\n is then removed to give compound \nII(C).\n This can typically be done by treating \nII(B)\n with a strong acid. A typical condition is to treat compound II(B) with 1:1 TFA : DCM at room temperature for two hours. Subsequent aqueous work up affords compound \nII(C).\n Alternatively, the transformation of compound \nII(A)\n to compound \nII(C)\n can be carried out in a single step. The alkylation of compound \nII(A)\n and the removal of the boc protecting group of the pyrrole nitrogen can be carried out in an one pot reaction. A typical reaction condition is to mix substrate \nII(A)\n with the alkylating reagent R\n1\n-Cl, excess DMA, one equivalent HCl, in dioxane at an elevated temperature and under microwave radiation. Compound \nII(C)\n then undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an R\n4\n electrophile to give compound \nI.\n The nucleophilic reaction can be alkylation, acylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination and other reactions that a secondary alkyl amine can carry out. An acylation reaction of compound \nII(C)\n can be carried out by reacting compound \nII(C)\n with an acylating R\n4\n moiety. A typical acylation reaction condition is to react \nII(C)\n with an isocyanate R\n4\n moiety in the presence of TEA at room temperature. Subsequent aqueous workup gives compound 1.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the second route of Scheme 2, the boc group on the pyrrole nitrogen is removed to give compound \nIII(A).\n The can typically be carried out by treating compound \nI(H)\n with a strong acid. A typical reaction condition is to treat compound \nI(H)\n with 4N HCl in dioxane and DCM. Subsequent aqueous workup affords compound \nIII(A).\n Compound \nIII(A)\n can then undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an R\n4\n electrophile give compound \nIII(B).\n Because the -NH\n2\n group attached to the pyrazole in compound \nIII(A)\n is less reactive than the pyrrole nitrogen of \nIII(A),\n the transformation of \nIII(A)\n to \nIII(B)\n can be carried out without protecting the pyrazole -NH\n2\n group of compound \nIII(A).\n The nucleophilic reaction carried out for this transformation can be an alkylation, acylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination. Relative mild reaction conditions are preferred to achieve the reaction selectivity. An acylation reaction of \nIII(A)\n to give \nIII(B)\n is carried out by treating compound \nIII(A)\n with an acylating reagent in the presence of base. A typical reaction condition is to mix compound \nIII(A)\n with excess of base, such as DIPEA in DCM and adding the resulting solution to an isocyanate at 0°C. The reaction mixture is held at 0°C for about two hours for the reaction to go complete. Subsequent aqueous workup gives compound \nIII(B).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nSelective acylation of the pyrrole nitrogen in the presence of the unprotected -NH\n2\n attached to the pyrazole to obtain compound \nIII(B)\n can also be done from compound \nI(H),\n through the intermediate of \nIII(D)\n. The pyrrole nitrogen of \nI(H)\n is deprotected and further acylated to give compound \nIII(D).\n This can be done by treating compound \nI(H)\n with a strong acid, reducing the reaction mixture to a residue and then reacting the residue with an acylating agent. A typical reaction condition is to treat compound \nI(H)\n with 4N HCl in dioxane at room temperature for two hours and subsequently remove all solvent. The residue is dissolved and basified by a base such as DIPEA. The resulting solution is then added to triphosgene at 0°C. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir at 0°C for an hour. Subsequent aqueous work up affords compound \nIII(D).\n The crude compound \nIII(D)\n then reacts with a nucleophile to give compound \nIII(B)\n. A typical reaction condition is to mix compound \nIII(D)\n with a R\n4\n nucleophilic amine moiety in the presence of a non-nucleophilic amine in DCM at room temperature. The reaction mixture is be held at room temperature for about two hours. Subsequent aqueous workup afford compound \nIII(B).\n \n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe ethyl ester protecting group on the pyrazole nitrogen of compound \nIII(B)\n is removed to give the free base compound \nIII(C).\n This can typically be done by treating compound \nIII(B)\n with a base. A typical reaction condition is to reflux compound \nIII(B)\n in dioxane and DCM in the presence of 2-3 equivalents of LiOH. Subsequent aqueous workup affords compound \nIII(C).\n Compound \nIII(C)\n then undergoes a nucleophilic reaction with an R\n1\n electrophile moiety. This nucleophilic reaction can be an acylation, alkylation, sulfonylation, reductive amination or one of many other reactions that an amine functionality carries out. A typical alkylation reaction condition is to treating compound \nIII(C)\n with an alkylating agent such as R\n1\n-Cl, in the presence of a base such as 2 equivalents of DMA, in a solvent such as NMP, the reaction mixture is then heated under microwave radiation to 140°C for hour hours.

This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenisation, or spray drying.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nCapsules (made, for example, from gelatin or HPMC), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as /-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA suitable solution formulation for use in an atomizer using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1µg to 20mg of the compound of the invention per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1µL to 100µL. A typical formulation includes a compound of the invention, propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nSuitable flavors, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for inhaled/intranasal administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for inhated/intranasat administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release using, for example, poly(DL-lactic-coglycolic acid (PGLA). Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nIn the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve which delivers a metered amount. Units in accordance with the invention are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or \"puff\" containing a desired mount of the compound of the invention. The overall daily dose may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the day.\n\n\n \n\n\nRectal/Intravaginal Administration\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention may be administered rectally or vaginally, for example, in the form of a suppository, pessary, or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, but various alternatives may be used as appropriate.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for rectal/vaginal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.\n\n\n \n\n\nOcular Administration\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronized suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, biodegradable (\ne.g\n. absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (\ne.g\n. silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nFormulations for ocular/aural administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted, or programmed release.\n\n\n \n\n\nOther Technologies\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nCompounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDrug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, \ni.e.\n as a carrier, diluent, or solubilizer. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in \n \nPCT Publication Nos. WO 91/11172\n \n, \n \nWO 94/02518\n \n and \n \nWO 98/55148\n \n, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.\n\n\n \n\n\nDosage\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nThe amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is typically in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 0.01 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.07 to about 7000 mg/day, preferably about 0.7 to about 2500 mg/day. In some Instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be used without causing any harmful side effect, with such larger doses typically divided into several smaller doses for administration throughout the day.\n\n\n \n\n\nKit-of-Parts\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nInasmuch as it may desirable to administer a combination of active compounds, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound in accordance with the invention, may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions. Thus the kit of the invention includes two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nThe kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically includes directions for administration and may be provided with a memory aid.\n\n\n \n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \nIn the following examples and preparations, \"BOC\", \"Boo\" or \"boc\" means N\n-tert-\nbutoxycarbonyl, DCM means CH\n2\nCl\n2\n, DIPEA or DIEA means diisopropyl ethyl amine, DMA means N,N-dimethylacetamide, \"DMF\" means dimethyl formamide, \"DMSO\" means dimethylsulfoxide, \"DPPP\" means 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, \"HOAc\" means acetic acid, \"IPA\" means isopropyl alcohol. \"MTBE\" means methyl t-butyl ether, \"NMP\" means 1-methyl 2-pyrrolidinone, TEA means triethyl amine, TFA means trifluoro acetic acid.\n\n\n \n\n\nSpecific examples:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1: 6,6-dimethyl-\nN-\n[trans-2-phenylcyclopropyl]-3-(thieno[3,2\n-d\n]pyrimidin-4-ylamino)-4,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,4\n-c\n]pyrazole-5(1\nH\n)-carboxamide.\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nPreparation of Compound 1a: \nN-\n(6,6-dimethyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4\n-c\n]pyrazol-3-yl)thieno[3,2\n-d\n]pyrimidin-4-amine\n.\n\n\n \n \n \nTo a stirring solution of \ntert-\nbutyl 3-amino-6,6-dimethyl-4,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,4\n-c\n]pyrazole-5(1H)-carboxylate (0.62g, 2.46 mmol) in DMA (3mL) was added 4-chlorothieno[3,2\n-d\n]pyrimidine(0.44g, 1.05eq) and 4N HCl solution in 1,4-dioxane (0.65ml, 1.05eq).

P33 (ACATATG TCC CATGAGCAGT TCCGGGCTGC CCTGCAGCT) and P34 (CTCA TGGGTGCTTC AGCAGCTCGG CTGCCGTGGC) were used as the 5' primer and 3' primer in PCR respectively. The PCR amplified product was cloned into Topo vector (Invitrogen Inc.), and verified by DNA sequencing. PAK4 KD was then subcloned into expression plasmid pET28a(+), pET24a(+), or pGST4.5. The recombinant plasmids containing PAK4 KD was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for recombinant protein expression. The production of PAK4 KD was induced at 27°C by the addition of IPTG into the cells. The cells were then harvested and lyzed for protein purification. Ni-NTA column (pET28a(+), pET24a(+)) and glutathione column (pGST4.5) were used for the purification. The purified protein was then subjected to thrombin to cleave the N-terminal tags that were inherited from the expression plasmids, and thus gave the PAK4 KD that were used for the Ki assay of this invention.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPAK4 kinase domain enzymatic assay conditions: the enzymatic activity of PAK4 KD was measured by its ability to catalyze the transfer of a phosphate residue from a nucleoside triphosphate to an amino acid side chain of a commercially available peptide (amino acid sequence EVPRRKSLVGTPYWM). The conversion of ATP to ADP accompanies the catalytic reaction. The PAK4 KD catalyzed production of ADP from ATP was coupled to the oxidation of NADH through the activities of pyruvate kinase (PK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The conversion of NADH to NAD\n+\n is monitored by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (e340 = 6.22 cm\n-1\nmM\n-1\n) using a Molecular Devices SPECTRAMAX 190 in conjunction with the Biomec FX. Typical reaction solutions contain 2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.35 mM NADH, 10 mM MgCl\n2\n, 1 mM DTT, 0.4mM peptide (EVPRRKSLVGTPYWM) 0.04 mM ATP, 1 units/mL PK, 1 units/mL LDH, 0.01% Tween 20 in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5. Assays are initiated with the addition of 25nM PAK4 KD. The PAK KD Ki of each compound of the invention (the inhibitor) was calculated based on multiple of Percent inhibition numbers of the inhibitor at different inhibitor concentrations. The peptide (amino sequence EVPRRKSLVGTPYWM) was purchased from American Peptide Company. NADH, MgCl\n2\n, HEPES, DTT, ATP and PK/LDH were purchased from Sigma. Tween 20 was purchased from Calbiochem.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nA sandwich ELISA method was used to measure the PAK4 kinase activity in whole cells. The level of PAK4-dependent phosphorylation of GEF-H1b can be determined by monitoring the binding of a phosphospecific antibody to GEF-H1b. A modified HEK 293 cell line is used in the bioassay and it has been engineered to overexpress both GEF-H1b and the kinase domain (KD) of PAK4. The KD of PAK4 is inducible in this cell line by tetracycline (Trex system, invitrogen). The name of this cell line has been designated TR-293-KDG. To establish a phosphorylation event on GEF-H1, cells are induced with doxycycline to express the PAK4 KD. Negative control wells do not receive induction. Candidate substance effect is measured as the ability to block this phosphorylation event.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nELISA plate was prepared by pre-coating the plates with a capture antibody (α-HA-tag mouse monoclonal anitibody), blocked with BSA, and washed in 0.1% tween 20 in tris-buffered saline (TBST). Tissue culture plates (precoated with poly-D-lysine) were seeded with TR-293-KDG cells. The TR-293-KDG Cells were induced to express the PAK4 KD with doxycycline overnight and subsequently & concomitantly treated with candidate substances or diluent for an additional 3-hour, continuous exposure. Cells were then lysed with a modified RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. The fresh whole cell lysates were then added to the ELISA plate for 2-hours. Between all subsequent steps plates were washed 4 times with TBST. Detection antibody (recognizing the phospho-specific eptitope on GEF-H1b) was added for 1 hour, followed by addition of an enzyme linked goat α-rabbit secondary antibody for 45 minutes. Color development of the enzyme-linked antibody was performed with a peroxidase substrate, ABTS (Moss, Inc.) with absorbance at 405nM read with a spectrophotometer after 30 minute incubation. EC50 values were calculated by sigmoid curve fitting using a four-parameter analysis.\n\n\n \n \n \n \nPAK4 Kinase Domain Ki data and PAK4 cellular assay EC50 data of the compounds of \nExamples 1-86:\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nEx. #\n \n \n \nKI data (uM)\n \n \n \nEC50 (nM)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n1\n \n \n0.041\n \n>2000\n \n \n \n \n2\n \n \n0.014\n \n36\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \n0.011\n \n16\n \n \n \n \n4\n \n \n0.11\n \n \n \n \n \n \n5\n \n \n0.22\n \n87\n \n \n \n \n6\n \n \n0.0028\n \n0.94\n \n \n \n \n7\n \n \n0.087\n \n>4000\n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n0.61\n \n \n \n \n \n \n9\n \n \n0.27\n \n>4000\n \n \n \n \n10\n \n \n0.12\n \n>4000\n \n \n \n \n11\n \n \n0.96\n \n \n \n \n \n \n12\n \n \n0.038\n \n78\n \n \n \n \n13\n \n \nN/A\n \n>4000\n \n \n \n \n14\n \n \n0.27\n \n \n \n \n \n \n15\n \n \n0.090\n \n500\n \n \n \n \n16\n \n \n0.076\n \n1267\n \n \n \n \n17\n \n \n0.77\n \n \n \n \n \n \n18\n \n \n0.34\n \n \n \n \n \n \n19\n \n \n0.19\n \n \n \n \n \n \n20\n \n \n0.090\n \n1199\n \n \n \n \n21\n \n \n0.24\n \n \n \n \n \n \n22\n \n \n0.72\n \n \n \n \n \n \n23\n \n \n0.14\n \n>4000\n \n \n \n \n24\n \n \n0.64\n \n \n \n \n \n \n25\n \n \n0.78\n \n \n \n \n \n \n26\n \n \n0.22\n \n \n \n \n \n \n27\n \n \n0.20\n \n \n \n \n \n \n28\n \n \n0.27\n \n \n \n \n \n \n29\n \n \n0.66\n \n \n \n \n \n \n30\n \n \n0.080\n \n968\n \n \n \n \n31\n \n \n0.020\n \n103\n \n \n \n \n32\n \n \n0.0035\n \n19\n \n \n \n \n33\n \n \n0.047\n \n618\n \n \n \n \n34\n \n \n0.021\n \n778\n \n \n \n \n35\n \n \n0.26\n \n262\n \n \n \n \n36\n \n \n \n \n>4000\n \n \n \n \n37\n \n \n0.27\n \n805\n \n \n \n \n38\n \n \n0.096\n \n1470\n \n \n \n \n39\n \n \n \n \n>4000\n \n \n \n \n40\n \n \n0.018\n \n98\n \n \n \n \n41\n \n \n0.024\n \n147\n \n \n \n \n42\n \n \n0.094\n \n610\n \n \n \n \n43\n \n \n0.45\n \n>4000\n \n \n \n \n44\n \n \n0.23\n \n>4000\n \n \n \n \n45\n \n \n0.025\n \n32\n \n \n \n \n46\n \n \n0.0072\n \n21\n \n \n \n \n47\n \n \n0.37\n \n401\n \n \n \n \n48\n \n \n1\n \n \n \n \n \n \n49\n \n \n0.16\n \n332\n \n \n \n \n50\n \n \n0.016\n \n340\n \n \n \n \n51\n \n \n0.018\n \n31\n \n \n \n \n52\n \n \n0.0035\n \n19\n \n \n \n \n53\n \n \n0.067\n \n1745\n \n \n \n \n54\n \n \n0.14\n \n \n \n \n \n \n55\n \n \n \n \n>4000\n \n \n \n \n56\n \n \n0.24\n \n570\n \n \n \n \n57\n \n \n0.94\n \n \n \n \n \n \n58\n \n \n0.014\n \n2.5\n \n \n \n \n59\n \n \n0.17\n \n2.4\n \n \n \n \n60\n \n \n0.040\n \n<3.9\n \n \n \n \n61\n \n \n0.022\n \n19\n \n \n \n \n62\n \n \n0.015\n \n15\n \n \n \n \n63\n \n \n0.02\n \n<3.9\n \n \n \n \n64\n \n \n0.003\n \n<3.9\n \n \n \n \n65\n \n \n0.68\n \n67.13\n \n \n \n \n66\n \n \n0.17\n \n<3.9\n \n \n \n \n67\n \n \n0.28\n \n20.\n \n \n \n \n68\n \n \n0.0067\n \n20\n \n \n \n \n69\n \n \n0.0019\n \n3.0\n \n \n \n \n70\n \n \n0.0088\n \n1.9\n \n \n \n \n71\n \n \n0.0052\n \n \n \n \n \n \n72\n \n \n0.016\n \n4.4\n \n \n \n \n73\n \n \n0.0016\n \n<3.9\n \n \n \n \n74\n \n \n0.0036\n \n<3.9\n \n \n \n \n75\n \n \n0.0052\n \n<3.9\n \n \n \n \n76\n \n \n0.0083\n \n<3.9\n \n \n \n \n77\n \n \n0.093\n \n69\n \n \n \n \n78\n \n \n0.33\n \n>4000\n \n \n \n \n79\n \n \n0.039\n \n<3.9\n \n \n \n \n80\n \n \n0.12\n \n20\n \n \n \n \n81\n \n \n0.084\n \n \n \n \n \n \n82\n \n \n2.5\n \n \n \n \n \n \n83\n \n \n0.058\n \n84\n \n \n \n \n84\n \n \n0.034\n \n455\n \n \n \n \n85\n \n \n0.10\n \n \n \n \n \n \n86\n \n \n0.055"
