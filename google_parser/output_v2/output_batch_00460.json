Description\n\n\n\n\n Heteroaromatic aryl triazole derivatives as PDE10A enzyme inhibitors \n\n\nField of the Invention \n\n\n The present invention provides heteroaromatic compounds that are PDE10A enzyme inhibitors, and as such are useful to treat neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising compounds of the invention and methods of treating disorders using the compounds of the invention. \n\n\nBackground of the Invention \n\n\n Throughout this application, various publications are referenced in full. The disclosures of these publications are hereby incorporated by reference into this application to describe more fully the state of the art to which this invention pertains. \n\n\nThe cyclic nucleotides cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic- guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) function as intracellular second messengers regulating a vast array of processes in neurons. Intracellular cAMP and cGMP are generated by adenyl and guanyl cyclases, and are degraded by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Intracellular levels of cAMP and cGMP are controlled by intracellular signaling, and stimulation/repression of adenyl and guanyl cyclases in response to GPCR activation is a well characterized way of controlling cyclic nucleotide concentrations (Antoni, F.A. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2000, 21, 103-132). cAMP and cGMP levels in turn control activity of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent kinases as well as other proteins with cyclic nucleotide response elements, which through subsequent phosphorylation of proteins and other processes regulate key neuronal functions such as synaptic transmission, neuronal differentiation and survival. \n\n\nThere are 21 phosphodiesterase genes that can be divided into 1 1 gene families. There are ten families of adenylyl cyclases, two of guanylyl cyclases, and eleven of phosphodiesterases. PDEs are a class of intracellular enzymes \n\n that regulate levels of cAMP and cGMP via hydrolysis of the cyclic nucleotides into their respective nucleotide monophosphates. Some PDEs degrade cAMP, some cGMP and some both. Most PDEs have a widespread expression and have roles in many tissues, while some are more tissue-specific. \n\n\nPhosphodieasterase 10A (PDE10A) is a dual-specificity phosphodiesterase that can convert both cAMP to AMP and cGMP to GMP (Loughney, K. et al. Gene 1999, 234, 109-1 17; Fujishige, K. et al. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999, 266, 1 1 18-1 127 and Soderling, S. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999, 96, 7071 - 7076). PDE10A is primarily expressed in the neurons in the striatum, n. accumbens and in the olfactory tubercle (Kotera, J. et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1999, 261, 551 -557 and Seeger, T.F. et al. Brain Research, 2003, 985, 1 13-126). Mouse PDE10A is the first identified member of the PDE10 family of phosphodiesterases (Fujishige, K. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1999, 274, 18438- 18445 and Loughney, K. et al. Gene 1999, 234, 109-1 17) and N-terminal splice variants of both the rat and human genes have been identified (Kotera, J. et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1999, 261, 551 -557 and Fujishige, K. et al. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999, 266, 1 1 18-1 127). There is a high degree of homology across species. PDE10A is uniquely localized in mammals relative to other PDE families. mRNA for PDE10 is highly expressed in testis and brain (Fujishige, K. et al. Eur J Biochem. 1999, 266, 1 1 18-1 127; Soderling, S. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999, 96, 7071 -7076 and Loughney, K. et al. Gene 1999, 234,109-1 17). These studies indicate that within the brain, PDE10 expression is highest in the striatum (caudate and putamen), n. accumbens and olfactory tubercle. More recently, an analysis has been made of the expression pattern in rodent brain of PDE10A mRNA (Seeger, T.F. et al. Abst. Soc. Neurosci. 2000, 26, 345.10) and PDE10A protein (Menniti, F.S. et al. William Harvey Research Conference 'Phosphodiesterase in Health and Disease', Porto, Portugal, Dec. 5-7, 2001 ). \n\n\nPDE10A is expressed at high levels by the medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the caudate nucleus, the accumbens nucleus and the corresponding neurons \n\n of the olfactory tubercle. These constitute the core of the basal ganglia system. The MSN has a key role in the cortical-basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop, integrating convergent cortical/thalamic input, and sending this integrated information back to the cortex. MSN express two functional classes of neurons: the Di class expressing Di dopamine receptors and the D\n2\n class expressing D\n2\n dopamine receptors. The Di class of neurons is part of the 'direct' striatal output pathway, which broadly functions to facilitate behavioral responses. The D\n2\n class of neurons is part of the 'indirect' striatal output pathway, which functions to suppress behavioral responses that compete with those being facilitated by the 'direct' pathway. These competing pathways act like the brake and accelerator in a car. In the simplest view, the poverty of movement in Parkinson's disease results from over-activity of the 'indirect' pathway, whereas excess movement in disorders such as Huntington's disease represent over-activity of the direct pathway. PDE10A regulation of cAMP and/or cGMP signaling in the dendritic compartment of these neurons may be involved in filtering the cortico/thalamic input into the MSN. Furthermore, PDE10A may be involved in the regulation of GABA release in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus (Seeger, T.F. et al. Brain Research, 2003, 985, 1 13-126). \n\n\nDopamine D\n2\n receptor antagonism is well established in the treatment of schizophrenia. Since the 1950's, dopamine D\n2\n receptor antagonism has been the mainstay in psychosis treatment and all effective antipsychotic drugs antagonise D\n2\n receptors. The effects of D\n2\n are likely to be mediated primarily through neurons in the striatum, n. accumbens and olfactory tubercle, since these areas receive the densest dopaminergic projections and have the strongest expression of D\n2\n receptors (Konradi, C. and Heckers, S. Society of Biological Psychiatry, 2001 , 50, 729-742). Dopamine D\n2\n receptor agonism leads to decrease in cAMP levels in the cells where it is expressed through adenylate cyclase inhibition, and this is a component of D\n2\n signalling (Stoof, J. C; Kebabian J. W. Nature 1981 , 294, 366-368 and Neve, K. A. et al. Journal of Receptors and Signal Transduction 2004, 24, 165-205). Conversely, D\n2\n receptor antagonism effectively increases cAMP levels, and this effect could be mimicked by inhibition of cAMP degrading phosphodiesterases. \n\n Most of the 21 phosphodiesterase genes are widely expressed; therefore inhibition is likely to have side effects. Because PDE10A, in this context, has the desired expression profile with high and relatively specific expression in neurons in striatum, n. accumbens and olfactory tubercle, PDE10A inhibition is likely to have effects similar to D\n2\n receptor antagonism and therefore have antipsychotic effects. \n\n\nWhile PDE10A inhibition is expected to mimic D\n2\n receptor antagonism in part, it might be expected to have a different profile. The D\n2\n receptor has signalling components besides cAMP (Neve, K. A. et al. Journal of Receptors and Signal Transduction 2004, 24, 165-205), wherefore interference with cAMP through PDE10A inhibition may negatively modulate rather than directly antagonise dopamine signaling through D\n2\n receptors. This may reduce the risk of the extrapyrimidal side effects that are seen with strong D\n2\n antagonism. Conversely, PDE10A inhibition may have some effects not seen with D\n2\n receptor antagonism. PDE10A is also expressed in Di receptors expressing striatal neurons (Seeger, T. F. et al. Brain Research, 2003, 985, 1 13-126). Since Di receptor agonism leads to stimulation of adenylate cyclase and resulting increase in cAMP levels, PDE10A inhibition is likely to also have effects that mimic Di receptor agonism. Finally, PDE10A inhibition will not only increase cAMP in cells, but might also be expected to increase cGMP levels, since PDE10A is a dual specificity phosphodiesterase. cGMP activates a number of target protein in cells like cAMP and also interacts with the cAMP signalling pathways. In conclusion, PDE10A inhibition is likely to mimic D\n2\n receptor antagonism in part and therefore has antipsychotic effect, but the profile might differ from that observed with classical D\n2\n receptor antagonists. \n\n\nThe PDE10A inhibitor papaverine is shown to be active in several antipsychotic models. Papaverine potentiated the cataleptic effect of the D\n2\n receptor antagonist haloperidol in rats, but did not cause catalepsy on its own (WO 03/093499). Papaverine reduced hyperactivity in rats induced by PCP, while reduction of amphetamine induced hyperactivity was insignificant (WO 03/093499). These models suggest that PDE10A inhibition has the classic \n\n antipsychotic potential that would be expected from theoretical considerations. WO 03/093499 further discloses the use of selective PDE10 inhibitors for the treatment of associated neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, PDE10A inhibition reverses subchronic PCP-induced deficits in attentional set-shifting in rats (Rodefer et al. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005, 4, 1070-1076). This model suggests that PDE10A inhibition might alleviate cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. \n\n\nThe tissue distribution of PDE10A indicates that PDE10A inhibitors can be used to raise levels of cAMP and/or cGMP within cells that express the PDE10 enzyme, especially neurons that comprise the basal ganglia, and the PDE10A inhibitors of the present invention would therefore be useful in treating a variety of associated neuropsychiatric conditions involving the basal ganglia such as neurological and psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and the like, and may have the benefit of not possessing unwanted side effects, which are associated with the current therapies on the market. \n\n\nFurthermore, recent publications (WO 2005/120514, WO 2005012485, Cantin et al, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 17 (2007) 2869-2873) suggest that PDE10A inhibitors may be useful for treatment of obesity and non-insulin dependent diabetes. \n\n\nWith respect to inhibitors of PDE10A, EP 1250923 discloses the use of selective PDE10 inhibitors in general, and papaverine in particular, for the treatment of certain neurologic and psychiatric disorders. \n\n\nWO 05/1 13517 discloses benzodiazepine stereospecific compounds as inhibitors of phosphodiesterase, especially types 2 and 4, and the prevention and treatment of pathologies involving a central and/or peripheral disorder. WO 02/88096 discloses benzodiazepine derivatives and their uses as inhibitors of phosphodiesterase, especially type 4 in the therapeutic field. WO 04/41258 discloses benzodiazepinone derivatives and their uses as inhibitors of phosphodiesterase, especially type 2 in the therapeutic field. \n\n Pyrrolodihydroisoquinolines and variants thereof are disclosed as inhibitors of PDE10 in WO 05/03129 and WO 05/02579. Piperidinyl-substituted quinazolines and isoquinolines that serve as PDE10 inhibitors are disclosed in WO 05/82883. WO 06/1 1040 discloses substituted quinazoline and isoquinoline compounds that serve as inhibitors of PDE10. US 20050182079 discloses substituted tetrahydroisoquinolinyl derivatives of quinazoline and isoquinoline that serve as effective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors. In particular, US 20050182079 relates to said compounds, which are selective inhibitors of PDE10. Analogously, US 20060019975 discloses piperidine derivatives of quinazoline and isoquinoline that serve as effective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors. US 20060019975 also relates to compounds that are selective inhibitors of PDE10. WO 06/028957 discloses cinnoline derivatives as inhibitors of phosphodiesterase type 10 for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological syndromes. \n\n\nHowever, these disclosures do not pertain to the compounds of the invention, which are structurally unrelated to any of the known PDE10 inhibitors (Kehler, J. et al. Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 2007, 77, 147-158 and Kehler, J. et al. Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 2009, 19, 1715-1725), and which have now been found by the inventors to be highly active and selective PDE10A enzyme inhibitors. \n\n\nCompounds comprising a -CH\n2\n-S- linker and where further HET-1 is either imidazo[1 ,2-a]pyridine or imidazo[1 ,2-a]pyrimidine are disclosed in publicly available chemical libraries. These compounds are therefore disclaimed. \n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may offer alternatives to current marketed treatments for neurodegenerative and/or psychiatric disorders, which are not efficacious in all patients. Hence, there remains a need for alternative methods of treatment. \n\n\nSummary of the Invention \n\n The objective of the present invention is to provide compounds that are selective PDE10A enzyme inhibitors. \n\n\nA further objective of the present invention is to provide compounds which have such activity, and which have improved solubility, metabolic stability and/or bioavailability compared to prior art compounds. \n\n\nAnother objective of the invention is to provide an effective treatment, in particular long-term treatment, of a human patient, without causing the side effects typically associated with current therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders. \n\n\nFurther objectives of the invention will become apparent upon reading the present specification. \n\n\nAccordingly, in one aspect the present invention relates to compounds of formula I: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwherein HET-1 is a heteroaromatic group of formula II containing from 2 to 4 nitrogen atoms: \n\n\n \n\n wherein Y can be N or CH, Z can be N or C, and wherein HET-1 may optionally be substituted with up to three substituents R7, R8 and R9 \n\n individually selected from H; d-Ce alkyl such as Me; halogen such as chlorine and bromine; cyano; halo(Ci-Ce)alkyl such as trifluoromethyl; aryl such as phenyl; alkoxy, such as methoxy, dimethoxy, ethoxy, methoxy-ethoxy and ethoxy-methoxy, and C1-C6 hydroxyalkyl such as CH\n2\nCH\n2\nOH, and wherein \n*\n denotes the attachment point, \n\n\n-L- is a linker selected from -S-CH\n2\n-, -CH\n2\n-S-, -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n- , -CH=CH-, and \n-c\n=\nc~\n ; R1 is selected from H; C1-C6 alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, 1 -propyl, 2-propyl, isobutyl; C1-C6 alkyl(C3-C8)cycloalkyl such as cyclopropylmethyl; C1-C6 hydroxyalkyl such as hydroxyethyl; CH\n2\nCN; CH\n2\nC(O)NH\n2\n; Ci-C\n6\n arylalkyl such as benzyl and 4-chlorobenzyl; and C1-C6 alkyl-heterocycloalkyl such as tetrahydropyran-4-yl-methyl and 2-morpholin-4-yl-ethyl; wherein Q is a phenyl, optionally substituted with 1 , 2 or three substituents or Q is a monocyclic 5-membered or 6-membered heteroaromatic group containing 1 or 2 heteroatoms, preferred Q is chosen among structures of the formula, wherein \"\n*\n\" denotes the attachment point: \n\n\n \n \n\n Wherein R2-R6 are each selected independently from H; C1 -C6 alkoxy such as methoxy; and halogen such as chlorine or fluorine; with the proviso that the compound is not 1 H-Benzimidazole, 2-[[(3-phenyl- 1 H-1 ,2,4-triazol-5-yl)thio]methyl]-; 1 H-Benzimidazole, 2-[[[3-(2-pyrazinyl)-1 H- 1 ,2,4-triazol-5-yl]methyl]thio]-; 1 H-Benzimidazole, 2-[[(3-phenyl-1 H-1 ,2,4- triazol-5-yl)methyl]thio]-; 1 H-Benzimidazole, 1 -ethyl-5-(1 -piperidinylsulfonyl)-2- [[[3-(2-thienyl)-1 H-1 ,2,4-triazol-5-yl]thio]methyl]-; 1 H-Benzimidazole, 6-methyl- 2-[[(3-phenyl-1 H-1 ,2,4-triazol-5-yl)thio]methyl]-; 1 H-Benzimidazole, 2-[[[3-(3- pyridinyl)-1 H-1 ,2,4-triazol-5-yl]methyl]thio]-; lmidazo[1 ,2-a]pyridine, 8-methyl- 2-[[(3-phenyl-1 H-1 ,2,4-triazol-5-yl)thio]methyl]-; lmidazo[1 ,2-a]pyridine, 6- chloro-2-[[[3-(2-thienyl)-1 H-1 ,2,4-triazol-5-yl]thio]methyl]-; 1 H-Benzimidazole, 2-[[[3-(4-pyridinyl)-1 H-1 ,2,4-triazol-5-yl]methyl]thio]-; lmidazo[1 ,2-a]pyridine, 6- methyl-2-[[(3-phenyl-1 H-1 ,2,4-triazol-5-yl)thio]methyl]-; 1 H-Benzimidazole, 2- [[[3-(2-pyridinyl)-1 H-1 ,2,4-triazol-5-yl]methyl]thio]-; lmidazo[1 ,2-a]pyridine, 6- chloro-2-[[(3-phenyl-1 H-1 ,2,4-triazol-5- yl)thio]methyl]-; 3H-lmidazo[4,5- b]pyridine, 2-[[(3-phenyl-1 H-1 ,2,4-triazol-5-yl)thio]methyl]-; or 1 H- Benzimidazole, 2-[[[3-(2-furanyl)-1 H-1 ,2,4-triazol-5-yl]methyl]thio]-; and tautomers and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and polymorphic forms thereof. \n\n\nIn separate embodiments of the invention, the compound of formula I is selected among the specific compounds disclosed in the Experimental Section herein. \n\n\nThe invention further provides a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use as a medicament. \n\n\nIn another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient. \n\n The invention further provides the use of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of a neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorder.

In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of this invention. \n\n\nTherapeutically effective amount \n\n\n In the present context, the term \"therapeutically effective amount\" of a compound means an amount sufficient to cure, alleviate or partially arrest the clinical manifestations of a given disease and its complications in a \n\n\ntherapeutic intervention comprising the administration of said compound. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as \"therapeutically effective amount\". Effective amounts for each purpose will depend on the severity of the disease or injury as well as the weight and general state of the subject. It will be understood that determining an appropriate dosage may be achieved using routine experimentation, by constructing a matrix of values and testing different points in the matrix, which is all within the ordinary skills of a trained physician. \n\n In the present context, the term \"treatment\" and \"treating\" means the management and care of a patient for the purpose of combating a condition, such as a disease or a disorder. The term is intended to include the full spectrum of treatments for a given condition from which the patient is suffering, such as administration of the active compound to alleviate the symptoms or complications, to delay the progression of the disease, disorder or condition, to alleviate or relief the symptoms and complications, and/or to cure or eliminate the disease, disorder or condition as well as to prevent the condition, wherein prevention is to be understood as the management and care of a patient for the purpose of combating the disease, condition, or disorder and includes the administration of the active compounds to prevent the onset of the symptoms or complications. Nonetheless, prophylactic \n\n\n(preventive) and therapeutic (curative) treatments are two separate aspects of the invention. The patient to be treated is preferably a mammal, in particular a human being. \n\n\nPharmaceutical compositions \n\n\n The present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one of the specific compounds disclosed in the Experimental Section herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. \n\n\nThe compounds of the invention may be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or excipients, in either single or multiple doses. The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents as well as any other known adjuvants and excipients in accordance with conventional techniques such as those disclosed in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19\nth\n Edition, Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1995. \n\n The pharmaceutical compositions may be specifically formulated for administration by any suitable route such as oral, rectal, nasal, pulmonary, topical (including buccal and sublingual), transdermal, intracisternal, intraperitoneal, vaginal and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intravenous and intradermal) routes. It will be appreciated that the route will depend on the general condition and age of the subject to be treated, the nature of the condition to be treated and the active ingredient. Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration include solid dosage forms such as capsules, tablets, dragees, pills, lozenges, powders and granules. Where appropriate, the compositions may be prepared with coatings such as enteric coatings or they may be formulated so as to provide controlled release of the active ingredient such as sustained or prolonged release according to methods well known in the art. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include solutions, emulsions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous and nonaqueous injectable solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders to be reconstituted in sterile injectable solutions or dispersions prior to use. Other suitable administration forms include, but are not limited to, suppositories, sprays, ointments, creams, gels, inhalants, dermal patches and implants. \n\n\nTypical oral dosages range from about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg body weight per day. Typical oral dosages also range from about 0.01 to about 50 mg/kg body weight per day. Typical oral dosages further range from about 0.05 to about 10 mg/kg body weight per day. Oral dosages are usually administered in one or more dosages, typically, one to three dosages per day. The exact dosage will depend upon the frequency and mode of administration, the sex, age, weight and general condition of the subject treated, the nature and severity of the condition treated and any concomitant diseases to be treated and other factors evident to those skilled in the art. \n\n The formulations may also be presented in a unit dosage form by methods known to those skilled in the art. For illustrative purposes, a typical unit dosage form for oral administration may contain from about 0.01 to about 1000 mg, from about 0.05 to about 500 mg, or from about 0.5 mg to about 200 mg. \n\n\nFor parenteral routes such as intravenous, intrathecal, intramuscular and similar administration, typical doses are in the order of half the dose employed for oral administration. \n\n\nThe present invention also provides a process for making a pharmaceutical composition comprising mixing a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. In an embodiment, of the present invention, the compound utilized in the aforementioned process is one of the specific compounds disclosed in the Experimental Section herein. \n\n\nThe compounds of this invention are generally utilized as the free substance or as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. One example is an acid addition salt of a compound having the utility of a free base. When a compound of formula I contains a free base such salts are prepared in a conventional manner by treating a solution or suspension of a free base of formula I with a molar equivalent of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. Representative examples of suitable organic and inorganic acids are described above. \n\n\nFor parenteral administration, solutions of the compounds of formula I in sterile aqueous solution, aqueous propylene glycol, aqueous vitamin E or sesame or peanut oil may be employed. Such aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. The aqueous solutions are particularly suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. The compounds of formula I may be readily incorporated into known sterile aqueous media using standard techniques known to those skilled in the art. \n\n Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous solutions and various organic solvents. Examples of solid carriers include lactose, terra alba, sucrose, cyclodextrin, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and lower alkyl ethers of cellulose. Examples of liquid carriers include, but are not limited to, syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, phospholipids, fatty acids, fatty acid amines, polyoxyethylene and water. Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include any sustained release material known in the art, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, alone or mixed with a wax. The pharmaceutical compositions formed by combining the compounds of formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier are then readily administered in a variety of dosage forms suitable for the disclosed routes of administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form by methods known in the art of pharmacy. \n\n\nFormulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, and optionally a suitable excipient. Furthermore, the orally available formulations may be in the form of a powder or granules, a solution or suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion. \n\n\nIf a solid carrier is used for oral administration, the preparation may be tabletted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form or it may be in the form of a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier will vary widely but will range from about 25 mg to about 1 g per dosage unit. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule or sterile injectable liquid such as an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspension or solution. \n\n\nThe pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be prepared by conventional methods in the art. For example, tablets may be prepared by \n\n mixing the active ingredient with ordinary adjuvants and/or diluents and subsequently compressing the mixture in a conventional tableting machine prepare tablets. Examples of adjuvants or diluents comprise: corn starch, potato starch, talcum, magnesium stearate, gelatin, lactose, gums, and the like. Any other adjuvants or additives usually used for such purposes such as colorings, flavorings, preservatives etc. may be used provided that they are compatible with the active ingredients. \n\n\nTreatment of Disorders \n\n\nAs mentioned above, the compounds of formula I are PDE10A enzyme inhibitors and as such are useful to treat associated neurological and psychiatric disorders. \n\n\nThe invention thus provides a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, as well as a pharmaceutical composition containing such a compound, for use in the treatment of a neurodegenerative disorder, psychiatric disorder or drug addiction in mammals including humans; wherein the neurodegenerative disorder is selected from the group consisting of Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia, alcoholic dementia or other drug-related dementia, dementia associated with intracranial tumors or cerebral trauma, dementia associated with Huntington's disease or Parkinson's disease, or AIDS-related dementia; delirium; amnestic disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder; mental retardation; a learning disorder, for example reading disorder, mathematics disorder, or a disorder of written expression; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; and age- related cognitive decline; and wherein the psychiatric disorder is selected from the group consisting of schizophrenia, for example of the paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated, or residual type; schizophreniform disorder; schizoaffective disorder, for example of the delusional type or the depressive type; delusional disorder; substance-induced psychotic disorder, for example psychosis induced by alcohol, amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, or phencyclidine; personality disorder of the \n\n paranoid type; and personality disorder of the schizoid type; and wherein the drug addiction is an alcohol, amphetamine, cocaine, or opiate addiction. \n\n\nThe compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be used in combination with one or more other drugs in the treatment of diseases or conditions for which the compounds of the present invention have utility, where the combination of the drugs together are safer or more effective than either drug alone.

LC-MS: m/z = 364.5 (MH\n+\n), t\nR\n = 1 .30 min, Method C. \n\n\nPharmacological Testing PDE10A enzyme \n\n\n Active PDE10A enzyme is prepared in a number of ways for use in PDE assays (Loughney, K. et al. Gene 1999, 234, 109-1 17; Fujishige, K. et al. Eur J Biochem. 1999, 266, 1 1 18-1 127 and Soderling, S. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999, 96, 7071 -7076). PDE10A can be expressed as full-length proteins or as truncated proteins, as long as they express the catalytic domain. PDE10A can be prepared in different cell types, for example insect cells or E. \n\n coli. An example of a method to obtain catalytically active PDE10A is as follows: The catalytic domain of human PDE10A (amino acids 440-779 from the sequence with accession number NP 006652) is amplified from total human brain total RNA by standard RT-PCR and is cloned into the BamH1 and Xho1 sites of the pET28a vector (Novagen). Expression in coli is performed according to standard protocols. Briefly, the expression plasmids are transformed into the BL21 (DE3) E. coli strain, and 50 ml_ cultures inoculated with the cells allowed to grow to an OD600 of 0.4-0.6 before protein expression is induced with 0.5mM IPTG. Following induction, the cells are incubated overnight at room temperature, after which the cells are collected by centrifugation. Cells expressing PDE10A are resuspended in 12 ml_ (50 mM TRIS-HCI-pH8.0, 1 mM MgCI\n2\n and protease inhibitors). The cells are lysed by sonication, and after all cells are lysed, TritonX100 is added according to Novagen protocols. PDE10A is partially purified on Q sepharose and the most active fractions were pooled. \n\n\nPDE10A inhibition assay \n\n\n A PDE1 OA assay may for example, be performed as follows: The assay is performed in 60 uL samples containing a fixed amount of the relevant PDE enzyme (sufficient to convert 20-25% of the cyclic nucleotide substrate), a buffer (50 mM HEPES7.6; 10mM MgCI\n2\n; 0.02% Tween20), 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 225 pCi of \n3\nH-labelled cyclic nucleotide substrate, tritium labeled cAMP to a final concentration of 5 nM and varying amounts of inhibitors. Reactions are initiated by addition of the cyclic nucleotide substrate, and reactions are allowed to proceed for one hr at room temperature before being terminated through mixing with 15 uL 8 mg/mL yttrium silicate SPA beads (Amersham). The beads are allowed to settle for one hr in the dark before the plates are counted in a Wallac 1450 Microbeta counter. The measured signal can be converted to activity relative to an uninhibited control (100 %) and IC\n5\no values can be calculated using the Xlfit extension to EXCEL. \n\n\nPhencyclidine (PCP) induced hyperactivity \n\n\n Male mice (NMRI, Charles River) weighing 20-25g are used. Eight mice are used in each group receiving the test compound (5 mg/kg) plus PCP (2.3 \n\n mg/kg) including the parallel control groups receiving the vehicle of the test compound plus PCP or vehicle injections only. The injection volumen is 10 ml/kg. The experiment is made in normal light conditions in an undisturbed room. The test substance is injected per oss 60 min before injection of PCP, which is administered subcutaneous. \n\n\nImmediately after injection of PCP the mice are placed individually in special designed test cage (20 cm x 32 cm). The activity is measured by 5X8 infrared light sources and photocells spaced by 4 cm. The light beams cross the cage 1 .8 cm above the bottom of the cage. Recording of a motility count requires interruption of adjacent light beams, thus avoiding counts induced by stationary movements of the mice. \n\n\nMotility is recorded in 5 min intervals for a period of 1 hour. The drug effect is calculated on the total counts during the 1 hour behavioral test period in the following manner: \n\n\n The mean motility induced by vehicle treatment in the absence of PCP is used as baseline. The 100 per cent effect of PCP is accordingly calculated to be total motility counts minus baseline. The response in groups receiving test compound is thus determined by the total motility counts minus baseline, expressed in per cent of the similar result recorded in the parallel PCP control group. The per cent responses are converted to per cent inhibition."

Additionally, this invention also relates to methods of preparation of substituted indolyl-piperidinyl benzylamines and intermediates therefor. \n\n\nDescription of the Art \n\n\n Mast cell mediated inflammatory conditions, in particular asthma, are a growing public health concern. Asthma is frequently characterized by progressive development of hyper-responsiveness of the trachea and bronchi to both immunospecific allergens and generalized chemical or physical stimuli, which lead to the onset of chronic inflammation. Leukocytes containing IgE receptors, notably mast cells and basophils, are present in the epithelium and underlying smooth muscle tissues of bronchi. These leukocytes initially become activated by the binding of specific inhaled antigens to the IgE receptors and then release a number of chemical mediators. For example, degranulation of mast cells leads to the release of proteoglycans, peroxidase, arylsulfatase B, chymase, and tryptase, which results in bronchiole constriction. \n\n\n Tryptase is stored in the mast cell secretory granules and is the major protease of human mast cells. Tryptase has been implicated in a variety of biological processes, including degradation of vasodilatory and bronchodilatory neuropeptides (Caughey, et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1988, 244, pages 133-137; Franconi, et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1988, 248, pages 947-951 ; and Tarn, et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol., 1990, 3, pages 27-32) and modulation of bronchial responsiveness to histamine (Sekizawa, et al., J. Clin. Invest., 1989, 83, pages 175- 179). \n\n\n As a result, tryptase inhibitors may be useful as anti-inflammatory agents (K Rice, P.A. Sprengler, Current Opinion in Drug Discovery and Development, 1999, 2(5), pages 463-474) particularly in the treatment of chronic asthma (M.Q. Zhang, H. \n\n Timmernnan, Mediators Inflamm., 1997, 1 12, pages 31 1 -317), and may also be useful in treating or preventing allergic rhinitis (S. J. Wilson et al, Clin. Exp. Allergy, 1998, 28, pages 220-227), inflammatory bowel disease (S.C. Bischoff et al, Histopathology, 1996, 28, pages 1 -13), psoriasis (A. Naukkarinen et al, Arch. Dermatol. Res., 1993, 285, pages 341 -346), conjunctivitis (A.A.Irani et al, J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 1990, 86, pages 34-40), atopic dermatitis (A. Jarvikallio et al, Br. J. Dermatol., 1997, 136, pages 871 -877), rheumatoid arthritis (L.C Tetlow et al, Ann. Rheum. Dis., 1998, 54, pages 549-555), osteoarthritis (M.G. Buckley et al, J. Pathol., 1998, 186, pages 67- 74), gouty arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, and diseases of joint cartilage destruction. \n\n\n In addition, tryptase has been shown to be a potent mitogen for fibroblasts, suggesting its involvement in the pulmonary fibrosis in asthma and interstitial lung diseases (Ruoss et al., J. Clin. Invest., 1991 , 88, pages 493-499). \n\n\n Therefore, tryptase inhibitors may be useful in treating or preventing fibrotic conditions (J.A. Cairns and A.F. Walls, J. Clin. Invest., 1997, 99, pages 1313-1321 ) for example, fibrosis, sceleroderma, pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, myocardial fibrosis, neurofibromas and hypertrophic scars. \n\n\n Additionally, tryptase inhibitors may be useful in treating or preventing myocardial infarction, stroke, angina and other consequences of atherosclerotic plaque rupture (M. Jeziorska et al, J. Pathol., 1997, 182, pages 1 15-122). \n\n\n Tryptase has also been discovered to activate prostromelysin that in turn activates collagenase, thereby initiating the destruction of cartilage and periodontal connective tissue, respectively. \n\n\n Therefore, tryptase inhibitors could be useful in the treatment or prevention of arthritis, periodontal disease, diabetic retinopathy, and tumour growth (W.J. Beil et al, Exp. Hematol., (1998) 26, pages 158-169). Also, tryptase inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of anaphylaxis (L.B. Schwarz et al, J. Clin. Invest., 1995, 96, pages 2702-2710), multiple sclerosis (M. Steinhoff et al, Nat. Med. (N. Y.), 2000, 6(2), pages 151 -158), peptic ulcers and syncytial viral infections. \n\n\n Such a compound should readily have utility in treating a patient suffering from conditions that can be ameliorated by the administration of an inhibitor of tryptase, e.g., mast cell mediated inflammatory conditions, inflammation, and diseases or disorders related to the degradation of vasodilatory and bronchodilatory \n\n neuropeptides, and have diminished liability for semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) metabolism. \n\n\n β-tryptase is located solely in mast cell granules as the most abundant serine protease and is released following stimulation of the IgE receptor by allergen. In experimental animals, β-tryptase release provokes inflammation and bronchoconstriction characteristic of human asthma. It is also thought to cause fibroblast activation and therefore to have a role in airways remodeling. Levels of β- tryptase are elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from asthmatic patients. Clinical proof-of-concept (bronchial allergen challenge) for asthma has been reported with an inhaled β-tryptase inhibitor (APC-366 - since terminated due to bronchial irritation), β-tryptase inhibitors have the potential to impact the symptoms and pathogenesis of a number of proinflammatory indications, in particular, asthma and potentially COPD. \n\n\n Benzylamine containing tryptase inhibitors, as one popular class of serine protease inhibitors, are also recognized as substrates for amine oxidases, especially SSAO. \n\n\n All of the references described herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. \n\n\n Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a series of substituted indolyl-piperidinyl benzylamines that are inhibitors of β-tryptase. \n\n\n It is also an object of this invention to provide processes for the preparation of the substituted indolyl-piperidinyl benzylamines as disclosed herein. \n\n\n Other objects and further scope of the applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description that follows. \n\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The present invention provides substituted indolyl-piperidinyl benzylamines of formula (I), and the stereoisomers, enantiomers, racemates and tautomers of said compounds and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as inhibitors of β- tryptase, and methods of using the compounds of formula (I) as pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of diseases and disorders. \n\n\n Thus in accordance with the practice of this invention there is provided a compound of formula (I): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (I) \n\n\n wherein \n\n\n R1 is F, CI, Br, OCH2CO2CH3, OCH\n2\nCONW1 W2, CH\n2\nOH or optionally \n\n\n substituted alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy or haloalkoxy; wherein W1 and W2 are independently H or alkyl; \n\n\n R2 is H, F, CI, Br, OH, CH\n2\nOH, alkyl or alkoxy; \n\n\n provided R1 and R2 are not H at the same time; and \n\n\n R3 is aryl or heteroaryl. \n\n\n This invention further includes various salts of the compounds of formula (I) including various enantiomers or diastereomers of compounds of formula (I). \n\n\n A further embodiment of the present invention relates to a method for inhibiting β-tryptase activity in a patient comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of an inhibitor of β-tryptase. \n\n\n Another embodiment of the present invention relates to a method for inhibiting β-tryptase activity in a patient comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I). \n\n\n Another embodiment of the present invention relates to a method for treating a patient suffering from a disease or disorder ameliorated by inhibition of β-tryptase comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I). \n\n\n In other aspects of this invention there are also provided various pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more compounds of formula (I) as well as their therapeutic use in alleviating various diseases which are ameliorated by inhibition of β-tryptase. \n\n DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n The terms as used herein have the following meanings: \n\n\n As used herein, the expression \"(Ci-C\n4\n)alkyl\" includes methyl and ethyl groups, and straight-chained or branched propyl, and butyl groups. Particular alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl and tert-butyl. Derived expressions such as \"(Ci-C\n4\n)alkoxy\", \"(C\nr\nC\n4\n)alkoxy(Ci-C\n4\n)alkyl\", or \"hydroxy(C\nr\nC\n4\n)alkyl\" are to be construed accordingly. \n\n\n As used herein, the expression \"(CrC\n6\n)perfluoroalkyl\" means that all of the hydrogen atoms in said alkyl group are replaced with fluorine atoms. Illustrative examples include trifluoromethyl and pentafluoroethyl, and straight-chained or branched heptafluoropropyl, nonafluorobutyl, undecafluoropentyl and tridecafluorohexyl groups. Derived expression, \"(Ci-C6)perfluoroalkoxy\", is to be construed accordingly. \n\n\n \"Halogen\" or \"halo\" means chloro, fluoro, bromo, and iodo. \n\n\n As used herein, \"patient\" means a warm blooded animal, such as for example rat, mice, dogs, cats, guinea pigs, and primates such as humans. \n\n\n As used herein, the expression \"pharmaceutically acceptable carrier\" means a non-toxic solvent, dispersant, excipient, adjuvant, or other material which is mixed with the compound of the present invention in order to permit the formation of a pharmaceutical composition, i.e., a dosage form capable of administration to the patient. One example of such a carrier is pharmaceutically acceptable oil typically used for parenteral administration. \n\n\n The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salts\" as used herein means that the salts of the compounds of the present invention can be used in medicinal preparations. Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of the compounds according to the invention or of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulfamic acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, hydroxymaleic acid, malic acid, ascorbic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, salicylic acid, cinnamic acid, 2- \n\n phenoxybenzoic acid, hydroxybenzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, benzoic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, malonic acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid. The acid metal salts such as sodium monohydrogen orthophosphate and potassium hydrogen sulfate can also be formed. Also, the salts so formed may present either as mono- or di- acid salts and can exist substantially anhydrous or can be hydrated. Furthermore, where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may include alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium or magnesium salts, and salts formed with suitable organic ligands, e.g. quaternary ammonium salts. \n\n\n The expression \"stereoisomers\" is a general term used for all isomers of the individual molecules that differ only in the orientation of their atoms in space. Typically it includes mirror image isomers that are usually formed due to at least one asymmetric center, (enantiomers). Where the compounds according to the invention possess two or more asymmetric centers, they may additionally exist as diastereoisomers, also certain individual molecules may exist as geometric isomers (cis/trans). Similarly, certain compounds of this invention may exist in a mixture of two or more structurally distinct forms that are in rapid equilibrium, commonly known as tautomers. Representative examples of tautomers include keto-enol tautomers, phenol-keto tautomers, nitroso-oxime tautomers, imine-enamine tautomers, etc. It is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures thereof in any proportion are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. \n\n\n As used herein, 'R' and 'S' are used as commonly used terms in organic chemistry to denote specific configuration of a chiral center. The term 'R' (rectus) refers to that configuration of a chiral center with a clockwise relationship of group priorities (highest to second lowest) when viewed along the bond toward the lowest priority group. The term 'S' (sinister) refers to that configuration of a chiral center with a counterclockwise relationship of group priorities (highest to second lowest) when viewed along the bond toward the lowest priority group. The priority of groups is based upon sequence rules wherein prioritization is first based on atomic number (in order of decreasing atomic number). A listing and discussion of priorities is contained in Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds, Ernest L. Eliel, Samuel H. Wilen and \n\n Lewis N. Mander, editors, Wiley-lnterscience, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. \n\n\n In addition to the (R)-(S) system, the older D-L system may also be used herein to denote absolute configuration, especially with reference to amino acids. In this system a Fischer projection formula is oriented so that the number 1 carbon of the main chain is at the top. The prefix 'D' is used to represent the absolute configuration of the isomer in which the functional (determining) group is on the right side of the carbon at the chiral center and 'L', that of the isomer in which it is on the left. \n\n\n In a broad sense, the term \"substituted\" is contemplated to include all permissible substituents of organic compounds. In a few of the specific embodiments as disclosed herein, the term \"substituted\" means substituted with one or more substituents independently selected from the group consisting of (Ci-C6)alkyl, (C\n2-\n C\n6\n)alkenyl, (Ci.C6)perfluoroalkyl, phenyl, hydroxy, -CO\n2\nH, an ester, an amide, (C C\n6\n)alkoxy, (CrC\n6\n)thioalkyl, (CrC\n6\n)perfluoroalkoxy, -NH\n2\n, CI, Br, I, F, -NH-lower alkyl, and -N(lower alkyl)\n2\n . However, any of the other suitable substituents known to one skilled in the art can also be used in these embodiments. \n\n\n \"Therapeutically effective amount\" means an amount of the compound which is effective in treating the named disease, disorder or condition. \n\n\n The term \"treating\" refers to: \n\n\n (i) preventing a disease, disorder or condition from occurring in a patient that may be predisposed to the disease, disorder and/or condition, but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; \n\n\n (ii) inhibiting the disease, disorder or condition, i.e., arresting its development; and \n\n\n (iii) relieving the disease, disorder or condition, i.e., causing regression of the disease, disorder and/or condition. \n\n\n Thus, in accordance with the practice of this invention there is provided a compound of formula (I): \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (I) \n\n\n wherein \n\n\n R1 is F, CI, Br, OCH2CO2CH3, OCH\n2\nCONW1 W2, CH\n2\nOH or optionally \n\n\n substituted alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy or haloalkoxy; wherein W1 and W2 are independently H or alkyl; \n\n\n R2 is H, F, CI, Br, OH, CH\n2\nOH, alkyl or alkoxy; \n\n\n provided R1 and R2 are not H at the same time; and \n\n\n R3 is aryl or heteroaryl. \n\n\n This invention further includes various salts of the compounds of formula (I) including various enantiomers or diastereomers of compounds of formula (I). As noted hereinabove and by way of specific examples hereafter all of the salts that can be formed including pharmaceutically acceptable salts are part of this invention. As also noted hereinabove and hereafter all of the conceivable enantiomeric and diastereomeric forms of compounds of formula (I) are part of this invention. \n\n\n In one of the embodiments, there is provided the compounds of formula (I) wherein R1 is F, CI, Br, OCH\n2\nCO\n2\nCH\n3\n, OCH\n2\nCONW1 W2 or CH\n2\nOH. \n\n\n In another embodiment of this invention there is also provided a compound of formula (I), wherein R2 is H, F, CI, Br, OH or CH\n2\nOH. \n\n\n In yet another embodiment of this invention there is also provided a compound of formula (I), wherein \n\n\n\n\n \n\n wherein \n\n\n R4 is alkyl optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from hydroxy, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, optionally substituted aryl and heteroaryl, or optionally substituted heteroaryl; and\n\n\nR5 is H, halo, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, alkyl, amido, carboxyl, ureyl, sulfonyl amido, sulfonyl urea, alkyl optionally substituted by one or more groups selected from hydroxy, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl. \n\n\n In yet another embodiment of this invention there is also provided a compound of formula (I), wherein R3 is indolyl that is optionally substituted. \n\n\n In a further aspect of this invention the compounds encompassed by the scope of this invention without any limitation may be enumerated as shown in the Examples section. All of these compounds may also include corresponding salts wherever possible including the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. \n\n\n This invention describes a novel alternative scaffold which can be used to generate a series of compounds with beta tryptase inhibitory activity. Based on the structure activity relationship (SAR) of piperidinyl benzylamines several P4 groups were chosen to determine whether this conformationally restricted scaffold would orient the P4 and P1 groups such that the molecules would have utility as beta tryptase inhibitors. \n\n\n The compounds of this invention can be synthesized by any of the procedures known to one skilled in the art. Specifically, several of the starting materials used in the preparation of the compounds of this invention are known or are themselves commercially available. The compounds of this invention and several of the precursor compounds may also be prepared by methods used to prepare similar compounds as reported in the literature and as further described herein. For \n\n instance, see R. C. Larock, \"Comprehensive Organic Transformations,\" VCH publishers, 1989. \n\n\n It is also well known that in various organic reactions it may be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, such as for example, amino groups, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice and known to one of skilled in the art, for example, see T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts in \"Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry\" John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1991 . For example, suitable amine protecting groups include without any limitation sulfonyl (e.g., tosyl), acyl (e.g., benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl) and arylalkyl (e.g., benzyl), which may be removed subsequently by hydrolysis or hydrogenation as appropriate. Other suitable amine protecting groups include trifluoroacetyl [-C(=O)CF\n3\n] which may be removed by base catalyzed hydrolysis, or a solid phase resin bound benzyl group, such as a Merrifield resin bound 2,6-dimethoxybenzyl group (Ellman linker) or a 2,6-dimethoxy- 4-[2-(polystyrylmethoxy)ethoxy]benzyl, which may be removed by acid catalyzed hydrolysis, for example with TFA. . \n\n\n In another aspect of this embodiment, a specific disease, a disorder or a condition that can be prevented and/or treated with the compound of this invention include, without any limitation the following: ., joint inflammation, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, gouty arthritis, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and other chronic inflammatory joint diseases. Other embodiments of physiological conditions that can be treated by the present invention include physiological conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), COPD exacerbations, joint cartilage destruction, ocular conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, allergic rhinitis, interstitial lung diseases, fibrosis, sceleroderma, pulmonary fibrosis, acute macular degneration, macular degeneration, wet macular degeneration, liver cirrhosis, myocardial fibrosis, neurofibromas, hypertrophic scars, various dermatological conditions, for example, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, \n\n\nmyocardial infarction, stroke, angina and other consequences of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, as well as periodontal disease, diabetic retinopathy, tumor growth, anaphylaxis, multiple sclerosis, peptic ulcers, and syncytial viral infections. \n\n As described hereinbelow by way of specific examples, the compounds of formula (I) bind to the β-tryptase and demonstrate the ability to inhibit it. The compound of formula I possesses tryptase inhibition activity according to tests described in the literature and described hereinafter, and which test results are believed to correlate to pharmacological activity in humans and other mammals. In addition the compound in formula one is a prodrug of a compound that possesses in- vitro typtase activity according to test described in the literature. Thus, in a further embodiment, the present invention is directed to the use of formula I or a composition comprising it for treating a patient suffering from, or subject to, a condition that can be ameliorated by the administration of an inhibitor of tryptase. For example, the compound of formula I is useful for treating an inflammatory disease, for example, joint inflammation, including arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritic condition such as rheumatoid spondylitis, gouty arthritis, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis or other chronic inflammatory joint disease, or diseases of joint cartilage destruction, ocular conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, allergic rhinitis, interstitial lung diseases, fibrosis, sceleroderma, pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis, myocardial fibrosis, neurofibromas, hypertrophic scars, various dermatological conditions, for example, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, myocardial infarction, stroke, angina or other consequences of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, as well as periodontal disease, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, acute macular degeneration, wet , macular degeneration, tumor growth, anaphylaxis, multiple sclerosis, peptic ulcers, or a syncytial viral infection. \n\n\n According to a further feature of the invention there is provided a method for the treatment of a human or animal patient suffering from, or subject to, conditions which can be ameliorated by the administration of an inhibitor of tryptase, for example conditions as hereinbefore described, which comprises the administration to the patient of an effective amount of compound of the invention or a composition containing a compound of the invention. Therefore, the compounds of this invention may have utility in the treatment of diseases or conditions ameliorated by inhibition of β-tryptase. Accordingly, the differential activities of these compounds may allow for utility to ameliorate multiple disease states as specifically enumerated above. \n\n Thus in one aspect of this invention there is provided a method of treating a disease in a patient, said disease selected from the group consisting of ., joint inflammation, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, gouty arthritis, traumatic arthritis, rubella arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and other chronic inflammatory joint diseases. Other embodiments of physiological conditions that can be treated by the present invention include physiological conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), COPD exacerbations, joint cartilage destruction, ocular conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, allergic rhinitis, interstitial lung diseases, fibrosis, sceleroderma, pulmonary fibrosis, acute macular degneration, macular degeneration, wet macular degeneration, liver cirrhosis, myocardial fibrosis, neurofibromas, hypertrophic scars, various dermatological conditions, for example, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, \n\n\nmyocardial infarction, stroke, angina and other consequences of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, as well as periodontal disease, diabetic retinopathy, tumor growth, anaphylaxis, multiple sclerosis, peptic ulcers, and syncytial viral infections; comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I). \n\n\n One of skill in the art readily appreciates that the pathologies and disease states expressly stated herein are not intended to be limiting rather to illustrate the efficacy of the compounds of the present invention. Thus it is to be understood that the compounds of this invention may be used to treat any disease caused by the effects of β-tryptase. That is, as noted above, the compounds of the present invention are inhibitors of β-tryptase and may be effectively administered to ameliorate any disease state which is mediated all or in part by β-tryptase. \n\n\n All of the various embodiments of the compounds of this invention as disclosed herein can be used in the method of treating various disease states as described herein. As stated herein, the compounds used in the method of this invention are capable of inhibiting the effects of β-tryptase and thereby alleviating the effects and/or conditions caused due to the activity of β-tryptase. \n\n\n In another embodiment of the method of this invention, the compounds of this invention can be administered by any of the methods known in the art. Specifically, the compounds of this invention can be administered by oral, intramuscular, subcutaneous, rectal, intratracheal, intranasal, intraperitoneal or topical route. \n\n Finally, in yet another embodiment of this invention, there is also provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound of formula (I), including enantiomers, stereoisomers, and tautomers of said compound and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or derivatives thereof, with said compound having the general structure shown in formula (I) as described herein. \n\n\n As described herein, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention feature β-tryptase inhibitory activity and thus are useful in treating any disease, condition or a disorder caused due to the effects of β-tryptase in a patient. Again, as described above, all of the preferred embodiments of the compounds of this invention as disclosed herein can be used in preparing the pharmaceutical compositions as described herein. \n\n\n Preferably the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are in unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, auto-injector devices or suppositories; for oral, parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. Alternatively, the compositions may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection. An erodible polymer containing the active ingredient may be envisaged. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from 0.1 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. Flavored unit dosage \n\n forms contain from 1 to 100 mg, for example 1 , 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 mg, of the active ingredient. The tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate. \n\n\n The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone or gelatin. \n\n\n The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered by any of the methods known in the art. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered by oral, intramuscular, subcutaneous, rectal, intratracheal, intranasal, intraperitoneal or topical route.

Inhibition of this catalytic activity may be measured by the in vitro enzyme assay and the cellular assay. \n\n\n Tryptase inhibition activity is confirmed using either isolated human lung tryptase or recombinant human beta tryptase expressed in yeast cells. Essentially equivalent results are obtained using isolated native enzyme or the expressed \n\n enzyme. The assay procedure employs a 96 well microplate (Costar 3590) using L- pyroglutamyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine-para-nitroanilide (S2366: Quadratech) as substrate (essentially as described by McEuen et. al. Biochem Pharm, 1996, 52, pages 331 - 340). Assays are performed at room temperature using 0.5mM substrate (2 x K\nm\n) and the microplate is read on a microplate reader (Beckman Biomek Plate reader) at 405 nm wavelength. \n\n\nMaterials and Methods for Tryptase primary screen (Chromogenic assay) \n\n\n Assay buffer \n\n\n50 mM Tris (pH 8.2), 100 mM NaCI, 0.05% Tween 20, 50 μg/mL heparin. \n\n\n Substrate \n\n\n S2366 (Stock solutions of 2.5 mM). \n\n\n Enzyme \n\n\n Purified recombinant beta Tryptase Stocks of 310 μg/mL. \n\n\nProtocol (Single point determination) \n\n\n • Add 60 μΙ_ of diluted substrate (final concentration of 500 μΜ in assay buffer) to each well \n\n\n • Add compound in duplicates , final concentration of 20 μΜ, volume 20 μΙ_\n\n\n• Add enzyme at a final concentration of 50 ng/mL in a volume of 20 μΙ_ \n\n\n· Total volume for each well is 100 μΙ_ \n\n\n • Agitate briefly to mix and incubate at room temp in the dark for 30 minutes\n\n\n• Read absorbencies at 405 nM \n\n\nEach plate has the following controls: \n\n\n Totals : 60 μΙ_ of substrate, 20 μΙ_ of buffer (with 0.2% final concentration of \n\n\n DMSO), \n\n\n 20 μΙ_ of enzyme \n\n\n Non-specific: 60 μΙ_ of substrate, 40 μΙ_ of buffer (with 0.2% DMSO) \n\n\nTotals: 60 μΙ_ of substrate, 20 μΙ_ of buffer (No DMSO), 20 μΙ_ of enzyme\n\n\nNon-specific: 60 μΙ_ of substrate, 40 μΙ_ of buffer (No DMSO) \n\n\nProtocol (ICm and K, determination) \n\n\n The protocol is essentially the same as above except that the compound is added in duplicates at the following final concentrations: 0.01 , 0.03, 0.1 , 0.3, 1 , 3, 10 \n\n μΜ (All dilutions carried out manually). For every assay, whether single point or IC50 determination, a standard compound is used to derive IC50 for comparison. From the IC\n50\n value, the K, can be calculated using the following formula: K, = IC\n50\n/(1 + [Substrate]/K\nm\n). \n\n\nThe compounds of this invention display beta-Tryptase inhibition in the range of 1 μΜ to <1 nM. \n\n\nBiological Activity \n\n\n The compounds of this invention display Ki values in the range of 1 μΜ to <1 nM as shown in Table 1 below. \n\n\n TABLE 1 \n\n\n EXAMPLE # Tryptase Ki (nM) \n\n\n 1 47 \n\n\n 2 234 \n\n\n 3 109 \n\n\n 4 1303 \n\n\n 5 96, 56 (8923:1 1 ) \n\n\n 6 20 \n\n\n 7 139 \n\n\n 8 35 \n\n\n 9 203 \n\n\n 10 175 \n\n\n 1 1 56 \n\n\n 12 26 \n\n\n 13 75 \n\n\n 14 83 \n\n\n 15 18 \n\n\n 16 97 \n\n\n 17 37 \n\n\n 18 40 \n\n\n 19 94 \n\n\n 20 19 \n\n\n 21 28 \n\n\n 22 390 \n\n\n 23 42 \n\n\n 24 98 \n\n\n 25 672 \n\n\n 26 306 \n\n\n 27 164 \n\n28 538\n\n\n29 331\n\n\n30 50\n\n\n31 306\n\n\n32 1280\n\n\n33 >10 uM\n\n\n34 1013\n\n\n35 8.6\n\n\n36 1 150\n\n\n37 87\n\n\n38 66\n\n\n39 10\n\n\n40 25\n\n\n41 62\n\n\n42 123\n\n\n43 850\n\n\n44 51\n\n\n45 753\n\n\n46 94\n\n\n47 56, 59\n\n\n48 125\n\n\n49 291\n\n\n50 241\n\n\n51 54\n\n\n52 49\n\n\n53 289\n\n\n54 96\n\n\n55 72\n\n\n56 9\n\n\n57 54\n\n\n58 108\n\n\n59 32\n\n\n60 22\n\n\n61 17\n\n\n62 22\n\n\n63 46\n\n\n64 39\n\n\n65 1 1\n\n\n66 164\n\n\n67 12\n\n\n68 35\n\n\n69 400\n\n\n70 21\n\n\n71 49\n\n\n72 13\n\n\n73 7\n\n\n74 26\n\n\n75 59\n\n\n76 21 1\n\n\n77 57 \n\n78 117 \n\n\n 79 935 \n\n\n 80 961 \n\n\n 81 224 \n\n\n82 6 \n\n\n 83 5 \n\n\n 84 22 \n\n\n 85 9 \n\n\n 86 80 \n\n\n87 207 \n\n\n 88 239 \n\n\n 89 11 \n\n\n 90 396 \n\n\n 91 20 (71954 nM; 892328 nM) 92 90 \n\n\n 93 160 \n\n\n 94 21 \n\n\n 95 44 (892315 nM, 719D 47 nM)\n\n\n96 18 \n\n\n97 28 \n\n\n 98 147 \n\n\n 99 25 \n\n\n 100 17 \n\n\n 101 11 \n\n\n102 22 \n\n\n 103 41 \n\n\n 104 204 \n\n\n 105 100 \n\n\n 106 149 \n\n\n107 315 \n\n\n 108 15 \n\n\n 109 142 \n\n\n 110 1260 \n\n\n 111 1017 \n\n\n112 998 \n\n\n 113 656 \n\n\n 114 526 \n\n\n 115 390 \n\n\n 116 746 \n\n\n117 756 \n\n\n 118 832 \n\n\n 119 180 \n\n\n 120 3 \n\n\n 121 99 \n\n\n122 44 \n\n\n 123 50 \n\n\n 124 8 \n\n Although the invention has been illustrated by certain of the preceding examples, it is not to be construed as being limited thereby; but rather, the invention encompasses the generic area as hereinbefore disclosed.
