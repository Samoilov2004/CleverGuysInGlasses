Description\n\n\n\n\n Uses of Natriuretic Peptide Constructs \n\n\nCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION \n\n\n This application claims priority to and the benefit of the filing of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/362,302 entitled \"Uses of Natriuretic Peptide Constructs\", filed April 21 , 2010, and the specification and claims thereof are incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n\n\nField of the Invention (Technical Field): \n\n\n The present invention relates to uses of natriuretic peptide constructs which include a plurality of amino acid residues and one or more ring-constrained amino acid surrogates and optionally one or more prosthetic groups, for the prophylaxis or treatment of airway diseases, including but not limited to acute asthma and COPD. \n\n\nBackground Art: \n\n\n The natriuretic peptide system has been extensively explored since the identification of the human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) sequence and gene structure in 1984. ANP is sometimes also called \"ANF\", or atrial natriuretic factor. ANP is part of the natriuretic peptide system, which in humans involves an ANP gene, which through differences in post-translational processing results in both ANP and urodilatin, a gene which produces BNP, or brain natriuretic peptide, and a gene which produces CNP, or c-type natriuretic peptide. ANP, urodilatin, BNP and CNP are each ring structures, with a 17 amino acid loop formed by a cysteine-cysteine disulfide linkage. ANP, urodilatin, BNP and CNP are closely related, differing by some five or six amino acids within the ring, though the N- and C-terminal tails are substantially different. \n\n\n There are three known natriuretic peptide receptors called natriuretic peptide receptors A, B and C (NPRA, NPRB and NPRC). NPRA and NPRB are linked to guanylyl cyclases, while NPRC is a G-protein linked clearance receptor. ANP, BNP and CNP are the primary endogenous mammalian natriuretic peptides identified to date. However, there are a number of non-mammalian natriuretic peptides that have been identified and may have therapeutic application in mammals. Human ANP is also referred to as wild-type human ANP, hANP, ANP(1-28) and ANP(99-126) (the later referring to the relevant sequence within proANP(1 -126), which is normally cleaved at Arg\n98\n - Ser\" in the C-terminal region during secretion). \n\n\n Human ANP and BNP, including human BNP made by recombinant means, have been described as potentially having application in the treatment of asthma and related diseases, presumably through a mechanism related to increased guanylyl cyclase production, which in turn catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), resulting in increased cGMP levels. See, for example, Leuchte, H.H.; Michalek, J. et al., \"Preserved pulmonary vasodilative properties of aerosolized brain natriuretic peptide,\" Pulmonary Pharmacology & Therapeutics 22:548-533 (2009); Matera, M.G.; Calzetta, L. et al., \"Relaxant effects of brain natriuretic peptide in nonsensitized and \n\n passively sensitized isolated human bronchi,\" Pulmonary Pharmacology & Therapeutics 22:478-482 (2009); and Hamad, A. M.; Clayton, A. et al., \"Guanylyl cyclases, nitric oxide, natriuretic peptides, and airway smooth muscle function.\" Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 285:973-983 (2003). \n\n\n There are reports in the literature of human studies involving administration of human ANP and human BNP, such as by intravenous administration of BNP (Akerman, M. J.; Yaegashi, M. et al., \"Bronchodilator Effect of Infused B-Type Natriuretic Peptide in Asthma.\" Chest 130:66-72 (2006)), intravenous administration of ANP (Fluge, T.; Fabel, H. et al., \"Urodilatin (Ularitide, INN): a potent bronchodilator in asthmatic subjects.\" Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 25:728-36 (1995)), and inhaled ANP (Angus, R. M.; Millar, E. A. et al., \"Effect of inhaled atrial natriuretic peptide and a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor on histamine induced bronchoconstriction.\" Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 151 :2003-2005 (1995). \n\n\n There are, however, no reports of studies for treatment of asthma or related indications with compounds with natriuretic peptide functions, but which have increased resistence to enzymatic degradation, increased circulation half life, increased bioavailability, increased efficacy, prolonged duration of effect and combinations of the foregoing compared to human ANP or human BNP. While some reports have utilized an inhibitor, such as a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, in combination with human ANP (see R. Angus et al., cited above), no reports have utilized compounds with the desired pharmacological properties. \n\n\n Notwithstanding the large number of compounds that have been developed, none have been commercialized for the prophylaxis or treatment of airway diseases, including but not limited to acute asthma and COPD, and no natriuretic peptide compositions are reported to be in in active clinical development for the prophylaxis or treatment of airway diseases, including but not limited to acute asthma and COPD. There is a substantial need for products with improved characteristics, including improved potency, half-life, modes of administration, bioavailability or prolonged duration of effect, which products are effective for one or more airway disease therapeutic indications. \n\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION \n\n\n In one aspect the invention provides a method of prophylaxis or treatment of airway diseases, including but not limited to acute asthma and COPD, by administration of a pharmaceutically effective amount of a construct which binds to a receptor for a natriuretic peptide, including but not limited to a receptor for ANP, BNP, CNP, sCP, DNP, TNP-a, TNP-b or TNP-c, wherein such construct includes a plurality of amino acid residues and at least one amino acid surrogate of the general formula I: \n\n\n\n\n\nwhere R and R' are each independently H or a natural or unnatural amino acid side chain moiety or derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety; x is 1 or 2; Y is CH\n2\n or C=0; W is CH\n2\n, NH or NR\"'; Z is H or CH\n3\n; n is 0, 1 or 2; J is -C(=0)- unless the surrogate is at the C-terminus position of the construct, in which case J is -H, -OH, -C(=0)-OH, -C(=0)-NH\n2\n or a C-terminus capping group; Q is a bond unless the surrogate is at the N-terminus position of the construct, in which case Q is -H or an amine capping group; R\"' is an acyl, a Ci to d\n7\n linear or branched alkyl chain, a C\n2\n to Ci\n9\n linear or branched alkyl acyl chain, a C-i to C-I7 linear or branched omega amino aliphatic, or a C-i to C\n17\n linear or branched omega amino \n\n aliphatic acyl; optionally at least one prosthetic group covalently bonded to a reactive group in a side chain of at least one of the amino acid residues, to an amine capping group where the surrogate is at the\n\n\nN-terminus position of the construct, or to a C-terminus capping group where the surrogate is at the C- terminus position of the construct; and the carbon atoms marked with an asterisk can have any stereochemical configuration .

In another particularly preferred aspect, where two or more of Aaa\n1\n to Aaa\n15\n are amino acid surrogates the amino acid surrogates are not contiguous, which is to say that each amino acid surrogate is separate from each other amino acid surrogate by at least one amino acid residue being interposed therebetween in the primary sequence. \n\n\n In yet another preferred embodiment, in the construct of formula I II at least one of Aaa\n3\n, Aaa\n5\n,\n\n\nAaa\n6\n, Aaa\n7\n, Aaa\n9\n, Aaa\n10\n, or Aaa\n12\n is an L- or D-isomer of Ala, preferably an L-isomer of Ala. \n\n\n In a particularly preferred embodiment, the construct of formula I II is a natriuretic receptor-specific construct of formula IV: \n\n Hept-C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (SEQ ID NO:3) (IV), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the construct of formula IV. \n\n\n In yet another embodiment, the invention provides methods for the prophylaxis or treatment of airway diseases, including but not limited to acute asthma and COPD, utilizing a construct of formula III further comprising one or more non-peptide bonds. Non-peptide bonds may be employed to decrease the susceptibility of a construct of the invention to degradation, such as improving the in vivo stability of constructs towards tryptic-like proteases by replacing the native peptide bond before each Lys or Arg residue with a non-peptide bond, such as an isostere of an amide, a substituted amide or a \n\n\npeptidomimetic linkage. In one specific embodiment, native peptide bonds are replaced with peptide bonds having a reversed polarity. In general, any non-peptide bond may be employed, and may be utilized between any two residues. A non-peptide bond includes bonds in which the carbon atom participating in the bond between two residues is reduced from a carbonyl carbon to a methylene carbon, such as a non-peptide bond -CH\n2\n-NH- or its isostere -NH-CH\n2\n-, or the use of other bonds such as -CH\n2\n-S-, -CH\n2\n-O-, or -C(=0)-CH\n2\n- or an isostere of any of the foregoing, or -CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n- or -CH=CH-. In general, non-peptide bonds include an imino, ester, hydrazine, semicarbazide, oxime, or azo bond. \n\n\n The constructs defined above may include one or more prosthetic groups. Prosthetic groups may be employed to modulate the residence time in circulation, to modulate bioavailability, modulate immunogenicity of constructs, or the like. In general, prosthetic groups \"modulate\" by increasing the residence time, bioavailability or the like, as the case may be, but prosthetic groups may optionally decrease residence time, bioavailability or the like. A \"prosthetic group\" thus includes any compound conjugated, such as by a covalent bond, to a construct of any formula, for purposes of improving pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic properties of the construct. Preferred prosthetic groups include polymeric groups, comprising repeat units which in turn comprise one or more carbon and hydrogen atoms, and optionally other atoms, including oxygen atoms. Such polymeric groups are preferably water- soluble polymers, and are preferably poly(alkylene oxide), polyvinyl pyrrolidone), polyvinyl alcohol), polyoxazoline or poly(acryloylmorpholine). A preferred poly(alkylene oxide) is poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). In addition to PEG, other poly(alkylene glycol) polymers may be employed, such as \n\n\npoly(propylene glycol) and poly(butylene glycol). \n\n\n In one embodiment, the prosthetic group is one or more PEG polymers covalently bound to a reactive group of the construct. The PEG polymer, or other prosthetic group, may be covalently bound to a reactive group on the side chain of one or more amino acid residues, or may be covalently bound to a reactive group on an amino acid surrogate. Such reactive groups of an amino acid surrogate may include a group covalently bound, directly or through one or more intermediates, to Q or J, or may include a reactive group forming a part of R or R'. \n\n\n If PEG is employed as the prosthetic group, the PEG polymer may have a molecular weight of from about 200 MW to about 50000 MW. The PEG polymer may be linear, and if linear, may be monofunctional, with a reactive group at one end and a non-reactive group at the other end, \n\n homobifunctional, with the same reactive group at each end, or heterobifunctional, with a different reactive group at each end. Alternatively, the PEG polymer may be branched, having generally a \"Y\"-shaped configuration, multi-armed, such as with two, three, four or eight arms, or other configurations known in the art. The PEG polymer preferably has at least one derivatized reactive group for linking to one or more defined groups on the construct of formula III, preferably by means of a covalent bond. The derivativized reactive group may link to, for example, an amine, hydroxyl, thiol, or carboxyl group on a construct, including on a terminal group of an amino acid residue, on a side chain of an amino acid residue, on a Q group of a surrogate, on a J group of a surrogate, or on an R or R' group of a surrogate. \n\n\n The PEG polymer preferably has, at one end, an end-cap group, such as a hydroxyl, alkoxy, substituted alkoxy, aleknoxy, substituted alkenoxy, alkynoxy, substituted alkynoxy, aryloxy or substituted aryloxy. The PEG polymer further preferably has, at at least one other end, a derivatized reactive group. In one embodiment, the PEG polymer is a linear or branched polyether with a terminal hydroxyl group, such as a monomethoxy PEG, which is derivatized with a linking group, such as an amine, maleimide or carboxylic acid. The available reactive groups of the construct dictate the derivatized linking group employed on the PEG polymer. Thus, in one embodiment, the N-terminal amine of the construct is employed, using a carboxylic acid derivatized PEG. In another embodiment, the C-terminal amine of the construct is employed, again using a carboxylic acid derivatized PEG. In yet another embodiment, if a Lys residue or homolog thereof is present in the construct, either the a or ε amino group thereof may be employed, again using a carboxylic acid derivatized PEG. Maleimide derivatized PEG may be employed with either a reactive thiol or hydroxyl group on the construct. Similarly, amine derivatized PEG may be employed with a reactive carboxyl group on any terminal group or side chain of an amino acid residue, on a Q group of a surrogate, on a J group of a surrogate, or on an R or R' group of a surrogate. \n\n\n Thus, in one aspect, PEG is activiated with one or more electrophilic groups and may be employed for coupling to amino groups of the construct, including coupling to an ε amino group of a side chain or an N-terminal or C-terminal amine. Representative electrophilic reactive groups include succinimidyl omethylbutanoate and other omethylbutyric acid esters, as disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,672,662 and 6,737,505, and may be be used with proteins, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2004/0235734. Alternatively, succinimidyl propionate may be employed as a reactive group, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,567,662, or N-hydroxysuccinimide may be employed with a branched PEG, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,932,462. The teachings of each of the foregoing patents and patent applications are incorporated by reference as if set forth in full. \n\n\n In another aspect, PEG polymers are provided with one or more reactive aldehyde groups, and employed for coupling to a terminal primary amine, such as an N-terminal or C-terminal amine. In another aspect, PEG polymers are provided with one or more thiol-reactive groups, such as a maleimide, ortho- pyridyldisulfide, or thiol group, and are employed for coupling to a reactive thiol in the construct of formula III, such as a reactive thiol in a cysteine side chain or a reactive thiol in a Q group of a construct. \n\n\n In one aspect, any of the methods, conjugates or schemes as disclosed in International Patent Publication No. WO 2004/047871 , or any reference cited therein, may be employed with the constructs of this invention. The teaching of the foregoing patent applications is incorporated by reference as if set forth in full. \n\n\n In general, some form of chemical modification may be employed to make an active PEG derivative with a reactive group. The reactive group may be an active carbonate, an active ester, an \n\n aldehyde, or tresylate. In part, the reactive group of the PEG determines the amino acid terminal group or side chain moiety to which the PEG derivative is bound. In general, site specific PEGylation is preferred, in part because the resulting construct is homogeneous, minimizing loss of biological activity and reducing immunogenicity. \n\n\n In one embodiment, the PEG has a molecular weight of from about 200 MW to about 50,000 MW, more preferably from about 2,000 MW to about 20,000 MW. In another embodiment, monomethoxy PEG, such as of the formula CH\n3\n-0(CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-0)n-CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-OH or CH\n3\n-0(CH\n2\n-CH\n2\n-0)n-H, where n is any integer from 2 to about 1200, is employed, preferably derivatized with an amine, maleimide or carboxylic acid linking group. \n\n\n In another embodiment, the prosthetic group, such as PEG, is conjugated to a construct by means of an enzymatically labile linker as described in Veronese FM and Pasut G. Pegylation, \n\n\n\"Successful approach to drug delivery.\" Drug Discovery Today 10: 1451 -1458 (2005), and the methods disclosed therein are incorporated here by reference. \n\n\n In another embodiment, the prosthetic group employed is a polymer with both a lipophilic moiety and a hydrophilic polymer moiety, as disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,359,030 and 5,681 ,81 1. In a related embodiment, the prosthetic group employed is an oligomer conjugate with a hydrophilic component, such as a PEG polymer, and a lipophilic component, such as a branched fatty acid or alkyl chain, linked by a hydrolyzable bond, such as an ester bond, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,309,633. In another related embodiment, the prosthetic group employed is an oligomer that includes poly(propylene glycol), and preferably at least two poly(propylene glycol) subunits, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,858,580. The teachings of each of the foregoing patents and patent applications are incorporated by reference as if set forth in full. \n\n\n In yet another embodiment, the teachings of U.S. Published Patent Application 2004/0203081 are incorporated here by reference, including specifically teachings relating to prosthetic groups, referred to in such application as \"modifying moieties,\" attached to various natriuretic compounds, and specifically oligomeric structures having a variety of lengths and configurations. In a related embodiment, the teachings of International Patent Publication WO 2004/047871 are incorporated by reference, including teachings related to \"modifying moieties\" attached by means of \"modifying moiety conjugation sites\" to natriuretic molecules binding to NPRA, it being understood that similar methods could be employed with natriuretic molecules binding to other natriuretic receptors. \n\n\n Certain terms as used throughout the specification and claims are defined as follows. \n\n\n The \"construct\" and \"amino acid residue sequences\" employed in this invention can be a) naturally-occurring, b) produced by chemical synthesis, c) produced by recombinant DNA technology, d) produced by biochemical or enzymatic fragmentation of larger molecules, e) produced by methods resulting from a combination of methods a through d listed above, or f) produced by any other means for producing peptides or amino acid sequences. \n\n\n By employing chemical synthesis, a preferred means of production, it is possible to introduce various amino acids which do not naturally occur into the construct, modify the N- or C-terminus, and the like, thereby providing for improved stability and formulation, resistance to protease degradation, and the like, and to introduce one or more amino acid surrogates into the construct. \n\n\n The term \"peptide\" as used throughout the specification and claims is intended to include any structure comprised of two or more amino acids, including chemical modifications and derivatives of \n\n amino acids. The amino acids forming all or a part of a peptide may be naturally occurring amino acids, stereoisomers and modifications of such amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically modified amino acids, and the like. The term \"peptide\" also includes dimers or multimers of peptides. A \"manufactured\" peptide includes a peptide produced by chemical synthesis, recombinant DNA technology, biochemical or enzymatic fragmentation of larger molecules, combinations of the foregoing or, in general, made by any other method. \n\n\n The term \"amino acid side chain moiety\" used in this invention, including as used in the specification and claims, includes any side chain of any amino acid, as the term \"amino acid\" is defined herein. This thus includes the side chain moiety present in naturally occurring amino acids. It further includes side chain moieties in modified naturally occurring amino acids, such as glycosylated amino acids. It further includes side chain moieties in stereoisomers and modifications of naturally occurring protein amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically synthesized amino acids, derivatized amino acids, constructs or structures designed to mimic amino acids, and the like. For example, the side chain moiety of any amino acid disclosed herein is included within the definition. A \"derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety\" as hereafter defined is included within the definition of an amino acid side chain moiety. \n\n\n The \"derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety\" is a modification to or variation in any amino acid side chain moiety, including a modification to or variation in either a naturally occurring or unnatural amino acid side chain moiety, wherein the modification or variation includes: (a) adding one or more saturated or unsaturated carbon atoms to an existing alkyl, aryl, or aralkyl chain; (b) substituting a carbon in the side chain with another atom, preferably oxygen or nitrogen; (c) adding a terminal group to a carbon atom of the side chain, including methyl (-CH\n3\n), methoxy (-OCH\n3\n), nitro (-N0\n2\n), hydroxyl (-OH), or cyano (- C≡N); (d) for side chain moieties including a hydroxy, thiol or amino groups, adding a suitable hydroxy, thiol or amino protecting group; or (e) for side chain moieties including a ring structure, adding one or ring substituents, including hydroxyl, halogen, alkyl, or aryl groups attached directly or through an ether linkage. For amino groups, suitable amino protecting groups include, but are not limited to, Z, Fmoc, Boc, Pbf, Pmc and the like. \n\n\n The \"amino acids\" used in embodiments of the present invention, and the term as used in the specification and claims, include the known naturally occurring protein amino acids, which are referred to by both their common three letter abbreviation and single letter abbreviation. See generally Synthetic Peptides: A User's Guide, G. A. Grant, editor, W.H. Freeman & Co., New York (1992), the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference, including the text and table set forth at pages 1 1 through 24. An \"amino acid\" includes conventional a-amino acids and further includes β-amino acids, a, a- disubstituted amino acids and N-substituted amino acids wherein at least one side chain is an amino acid side chain moiety as defined herein. An \"amino acid\" further includes N-alkyl a-amino acids, wherein the N-terminus amino group has a C-i to C\n6\n linear or branched alkyl substituent. It may thus be seen that the term \"amino acid\" includes stereoisomers and modifications of naturally occurring protein amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically synthesized amino acids, derivatized amino acids, constructs or structures designed to mimic amino acids, and the like. Modified and unusual amino acids are described generally in Synthetic Peptides: A User's Guide, cited above; Hruby V. J., Al-obeidi F., Kazmierski W., Biochem. J. 268:249-262 (1990); and Toniolo C, Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 35:287-300 (1990); the teachings of all of which are incorporated herein by \n\n reference. In addition, the following abbreviations, including amino acids and protecting and modifying groups thereof, have the meanings given: \n\n\n Abu gamma-amino butyric acid \n\n\n 12-Ado 12-amino dodecanoic acid \n\n\n Aib alpha-aminoisobutyric acid \n\n\n 6-Ahx 6-amino hexanoic acid \n\n\n Amc 4-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexane car \n\n\n 8-Aoc 8-amino octanoic acid \n\n\n Bip biphenylalanine \n\n\n Boc t-butoxycarbonyl \n\n\n Bzl benzyl \n\n\n Bz benzoyl \n\n\n Cit citrulline \n\n\n Dab diaminobutyric acid \n\n\n Dap diaminopropionic acid \n\n\n Dip 3,3-diphenylalanine \n\n\n Disc 1 ,3-dihydro-2H-isoindolecarboxyli \n\n\n Et ethyl \n\n\n Fmoc fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl \n\n\n Hept heptanoyl (CH\n3\n-(CH\n2\n)\n5\n-C(=0)-) \n\n\n Hex hexanoyl (CH\n3\n-(CH\n2\n)\n4\n-C(=0)-) \n\n\n HArg homoarginine \n\n\n HCys homocysteine \n\n\n HLys homolysine \n\n\n HPhe homophenylalanine \n\n\n HSer homoserine \n\n\n Me methyl \n\n\n Met(O) methionine sulfoxide \n\n\n Met(0\n2\n) methionine sulfone \n\n\n Nva norvaline \n\n\n Pgi phenylglycine \n\n\n Pr propyl \n\n\n Pr-i isopropyl \n\n\n Sar sarcosine \n\n\n Tie tert-butylalanine \n\n\n Z benzyloxycarbonyl \n\n\n In the listing of constructs according to the present invention, conventional amino acid residues have their conventional meaning as given in Chapter 2400 of the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure, 8\nth\n Ed. Thus, \"Nle\" is norleucine; \"Asp\" is aspartic acid; \"His\" is histidine; \"Arg\" is arginine; \"Trp\" is tryptophan; \"Lys\" is lysine; \"Gly\" is glycine; \"Pro\" is proline; \"Tyr\" is tyrosine, \"Ser\" is serine and so on. All residues are in the L-isomer configuration unless the D-isomer is specificed, as in \"D-Ala\" for D-alanine. \n\n\n A single amino acid, including stereoisomers and modifications of naturally occurring protein \n\n amino acids, non-protein amino acids, post-translationally modified amino acids, enzymatically synthesized amino acids, derivatized amino acids, an a, a-disubstituted amino acid derived from any of the foregoing (i.e. , an a, a-disubstituted amino acid wherein at least one side chain is the same as that of the residue from which it is derived), a β-amino acid derived from any of the foregoing (i.e. , a β-amino acid which other than for the presence of a β-carbon is otherwise the same as the residue from which it is derived) and the like, including all of the foregoing, is sometimes referred to herein as a \"residue.\" \n\n\n An \"a, a-disubstituted amino acid\" includes any a-amino acid having a further substituent in the a- position , which substituent may be the same as or different from the side chain moiety of the a-amino acid. Suitable substituents, in addition to the side chain moiety of the a-amino acid, include Ci to C\n6\n linear or branched alkyl. Aib is an example of an a, α-disubstituted amino acid . While a, α-disubstituted amino acids can be referred to using conventional L- and D-isomeric references, it is to be understood that such references are for convenience, and that where the substituents at the a-position are different, such amino acid can interchangeably be referred to as an a, a-disubstituted amino acid derived from the L- or D- isomer, as appropriate, of a residue with the designated amino acid side chain moiety. Thus (S)-2-Amino- 2-methyl-hexanoic acid can be referred to as either an a, a-disubstituted amino acid derived from L-Nle or as an a, a-disubstituted amino acid derived from D-Ala. Whenever an a, a-disubstituted amino acid is provided, it is to be understood as including all (R) and (S) configurations thereof. \n\n\n An \"N-substituted amino acid\" includes any amino acid wherein an amino acid side chain moiety is covalently bonded to the backbone amino group, optionally where there are no substituents other than H in the a-carbon position. Sarcosine is an example of an N-substituted amino acid . By way of example, sarcosine can be referred to as an N-substituted amino acid derivative of Ala, in that the amino acid side chain moiety of sarcosine and Ala is the same, methyl . \n\n\n The term \"amino acid surrogate\" includes a molecule disclosed herein which is a mimic of a residue, including but not limited to piperazine core molecules, keto-piperazine core molecules and diazepine core molecules. Unless otherwise specified, an amino acid surrogate is understood to include both a carboxyl group and amino group, and a group corresponding to an amino acid side chain, or in the case of an amino acid surrogate of glycine, no side chain other than hydrogen. Thus an amino acid surrogate includes a molecule of the general formula of formula I or I I given above. An amino acid surrogate further includes molecules of any of the following structures, it being understood that for convenience such structures are given as the isolated surrogate, not including any protecting group and not bound by one or two peptide bonds to one or two amino acid residues forming a part of a construct of the in \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere R, R', x and the asterisks are as defined for the surrogate of formula I . An amino acid surrogate further includes molecules of any of the following structures, again it being understood that for convenience such structures are given as the isolated surrogate, not including any protecting group and not bound by one or two peptide bonds to one or two amino acid residues forming a part of a construct of the invention: \n\n \n\n\n where R, R', x and the asterisks are as defined for the surrogate of formula I. For purposes of synthesis, either the carboxyl group or the amino group of any amino acid surrogate is preferably protected by a protecting group, such that it is not reactive while the protecting group is present, and similarly any reactive group forming a part of R or R' may similarly be protected by a protecting group. It will be appreciated that the surrogates of the present invention have more than one asymmetric center, and therefore are capable of existing in more than one stereoisomeric form. Some of the compounds may also exist as geometric isomers and rotamers. Furthermore, some compounds of the invention may also have conformational axial chirality resulting in atropisomers. The invention extends to each of these forms individually and to mixtures thereof, including racemates. In one aspect, surrogate isomers may be separated conventionally by chromatographic methods or by use of a resolving agent. In another aspect, individual surrogate isomers, or enantiomerically pure surrogates, are prepared by synthetic schemes, such as those disclosed herein or variants of such schemes, employing asymmetric synthesis using chiral intermediates, reagents or catalysts. \n\n\n The term \"C-terminus capping group\" includes any terminal group attached through the terminal ring carbon atom or, if provided, terminal carboxyl group, of the C-terminus of a construct. The terminal ring carbon atom or, if provided, terminal carboxyl group, may form a part of a residue, or may form a part of an amino acid surrogate. In a preferred aspect, the C-terminus capping group forms a part of an amino acid surrogate which is at the C-terminus position of the construct. The C-terminus capping group includes, but is not limited to, -(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-OH, -(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-C(=0)-OH, -(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-OH, -(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-C(=0)-N(v\n1\n )(v\n2\n), -(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-C(=0)-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-N(\nVl\n )(v\n2\n), -(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-0-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-CH\n3\n, -(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-C(=0)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-CH\n3\n, \n\n\n-(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-C(=0)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-N(\nVl\n )(v\n2\n), -(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-C(=0)-N-((CH\n2\n)\nm\n-N(\nVl\n )(v\n2\n))\n2\n, \n\n\n-(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-C(=0)-NH-CH(-C(=0)-OH)-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-N(\nVl\n )(v\n2\n), \n\n\n-C(=0)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-NH-C(=0)-CH(N(\nVl\n )(v\n2\n))((CH\n2\n)\nm\n-N(\nVl\n )(v\n2\n)), or \n\n\n-(CH\n2\n)\nn\n-C(=0)-NH-CH(-C(=0)-NH\n2\n)-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-N(v\n1\n )(v\n2\n), including all (R) or (S) configurations of the foregoing, where v-i and v\n2\n are each independently H, a C-i to C\n17\n linear or branched alkyl chain, m is 0 to 17 and n is 0 to 2; or any omega amino aliphatic, terminal aryl or aralkyl , including groups such as methyl, dimethyl , ethyl , propyl, isopropyl, butyl , isobutyl, pentyl, hexyl, allyl, cyclopropane methyl, hexanoyl, heptanoyi , acetyl , propionoyi, butanoyi, phenylacetyl, cyclohexylacetyl, naphthylacetyl , cinnamoyi, phenyl, benzyl, benzoyl , 12-Ado, 7 -amino heptanoyi, 6-Ahx, Amc or 8-Aoc, or any single natural or unnatural o amino acid, β-amino acid or a, a-disubstituted amino acid, including all (R) or (S) configurations of the foregoing , optionally in combination with any of the foregoing non-amino acid capping groups. In the foregoing , it is to be understood that, for example, -C(=0)-NH-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-NH- C(=0)-CH(N(\nV1\n )(v\n2\n))((CH\n2\n)\nm\n-N(\nVl\n )(v\n2\n)) is: \n\n\n \n\n The term \"N-terminus capping group\" includes any terminal group attached through the terminal amine of the N-terminus of a construct. The terminal amine may form a part of a residue, or may form a part of an amino acid surrogate. In a preferred aspect, the N-terminus capping group forms a part of an amino acid surrogate which is at the N-terminus position of the construct. The N-terminus capping group includes, but is not limited to, any omega amino aliphatic, acyl group or terminal aryl or aralkyl including groups such as methyl, dimethyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, hexyl, allyl, cyclopropane methyl, hexanoyl, heptanoyi, acetyl, propionoyl, butanoyl, phenylacetyl, cyclohexylacetyl, naphthylacetyl, cinnamoyl, phenyl, benzyl, benzoyl, 12-Ado, 7 -amino heptanoyi, 6-Ahx, Amc or 8-Aoc, or alternatively an\n\n\nN-terminus capping group is -(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-NH(v\n3\n), -(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-CH\n3\n, -C(=0)-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-CH\n3\n, -C(=0)-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-NH(v\n3\n), -C(=0)-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-C(=0)-OH, -C(=0)-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-C(=0)-(v\n4\n), -(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-C(=0)-OH, -(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-C(=0)-(v\n4\n), \n\n\n C(=0)-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-0(v\n3\n), -(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-0(v\n3\n), C(=0)-(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-S(v\n3\n), or -(CH\n2\n)\nm\n-S(v\n3\n), where v\n3\n is H or a d to C\n17\n linear or branched alkyl chain, and v\n4\n is a C-i to C\n17\n linear or branched alkyl chain and m is 0 to 17. \n\n\n A phenyl ring is \"substituted\" when the phenyl ring includes one or more substituents \n\n\nindependently comprising hydroxyl, halogen, alkyl, or aryl groups attached directly or through an ether linkage. Where the phenyl ring is so substituted, the amino acid residue may be referred to as substituted, as in substituted Phe, substituted HPhe or substituted Pgl. \n\n\n The term \"alkene\" includes unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain one or more double carbon- carbon bonds. Examples of alkene groups include ethylene, propene, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"alkenyl\" includes a linear monovalent hydrocarbon radical of two to six carbon atoms or a branched monovalent hydrocarbon radical of three to six carbon atoms containing at least one double bond; examples thereof include ethenyl, 2-propenyl, and the like. \n\n\n The \"alkyl\" groups specified herein include those alkyl radicals of the designated length in either a straight or branched configuration. Examples of alkyl radicals include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, hexyl, isohexyl, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"alkynyl\" includes a linear monovalent hydrocarbon radical of two to six carbon atoms or a branched monovalent hydrocarbon radical of three to six carbon atoms containing at least one triple bond; examples thereof include ethynyl, propynal, butynyl, and the like. \n\n\n The term \"aryl\" includes a monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon radical of 6 to 12 ring atoms, and optionally substituted independently with one or more substituents selected from alkyl, haloalkyi, cydoalkyi, alkoxy, alkythio, halo, nitro, acyl, cyano, amino, monosubstituted amino, disubstituted amino, hydroxy, carboxy, or alkoxy-carbonyl.

Examples of omega amino aliphatics include 7'-amino-heptanoyl and the amino acid side chain moieties of ornithine and lysine. \n\n\n The term \"heteroaryl\" includes mono- and bicyclic aromatic rings containing from 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl are monocyclic heteroaromatic rings; examples thereof include thiazole, oxazole, thiophene, furan, pyrrole, imidazole, isoxazole, pyrazole, triazole, thiadiazole, tetrazole, oxadiazole, pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, and the like. Bicyclic heteroaromatic rings include, but are not limited to, benzothiadiazole, indole, benzothiophene, benzofuran, benzimidazole, benzisoxazole, benzothiazole, quinoline, benzotriazole, benzoxazole, isoquinoline, purine, furopyridine and thienopyridine. \n\n\n An \"amide\" includes compounds that have a trivalent nitrogen attached to a carbonyl group (-C(=0)-NH\n2\n), such as for example methylamide, ethylamide, propylamide, and the like. \n\n\n An \"imide\" includes compounds containing an imido group (-C(=0)-NH-C(=0)-). \n\n\n An \"amine\" includes compounds that contain an amino group (-NH\n2\n). \n\n\n A \"nitrile\" includes compounds that are carboxylic acid derivatives and contain a (-CN) group bound to an organic group. \n\n\n The term \"halogen\" is intended to include the halogen atoms fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, and groups including one or more halogen atoms, such as -CF\n3\n and the like. \n\n\n The term \"composition\", as in pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a construct of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. \n\n\n The term \"EC\n50\n\" is intended to include the molar concentration of an agonist which produced 50% of the maximum possible response for that agonist. By way of example, a construct which, at a concentration of 72 nM, produces 50% of the maximum possible response for that construct as determined in a cGMP assay, has an EC\n50\n of 72 nM. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with an EC\n50\n determination is in nanomoles (nM). \n\n\n The term \"Ki (nM)\" is intended to include the equilibrium receptor binding affinity representing the molar concentration of a competing compound that binds to half the binding sites of a receptor at equilibrium in the absence of a competitor. In general, the Ki is inversely correlated to the affinity of the compound for the receptor, such that if the Ki is low, the affinity is high. Ki may be determined using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff (Cheng Y., Prusoff W. H., Biochem. Pharmacol. 22: 3099-3108, 1973): \n\n\n EC50 \n\n\n Ki : \n\n\n [ligand]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere \"ligand\" is the concentration of ligand, which may be a radioligand, and K\nd\n is an inverse measure of receptor affinity which produces 50% receptor occupancy. Unless otherwise specified, the molar concentration associated with a Ki determination is nM. \n\n\n The chemical naming protocol and structure diagrams used herein employ and rely on the chemical naming features as utilized by the ChemDraw program (available from Cambridgesoft Corp., \n\n Cambridge, Mass.). In particular, certain compound names were derived from the structures using the\n\n\nAutonom program as utilized by Chemdraw Ultra or ISIS base (MDL Corp.). In general, structure diagrams do not depict hydrogen atoms associated with carbon atoms other than in terminal groups and other special circumstances. \n\n\n Certain structure diagrams and drawings herein, such as those included in Tables 1 and 2, depict constructs composed of amino acid surrogates and amino acid residues, with the surrogates identified by structure diagrams and the amino acid residues identified by a three letter abbreviation. Unless otherwise specified, it is understood that the bond between the surrogate and residue, or between the residue and surrogate, or between a surrogate and residues on both the N-terminus and C-terminus side thereof, is a conventional peptide bond, -C(=0)-NH- or, in the case where the peptide bond is to the ring nitrogen on the N-terminus of the surrogate, -C(=0)-N-. In general, in the depiction of such bonds the atoms of the amino acid surrogate are depicted (e.g., -C(=0)- or -N), but atoms of the amino acid residue are not depicted. \n\n\n Formulation and Utility \n\n\n The constructs disclosed herein can be used for both medical applications and animal husbandry or veterinary applications. Typically, the construct, or a pharmaceutical composition including the construct, is used in humans, but may also be used in other mammals. The term \"patient\" is intended to denote a mammalian individual, and is so used throughout the specification and in the claims. The primary applications of this invention involve human patients, but this invention may be applied to laboratory, farm, zoo, wildlife, pet, sport or other animals. \n\n\n The methods and uses disclosed herein may be employed for the prophylaxis or treatment of airway diseases, including but not limited to acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). \n\n\n Airway diseases include any inflammatory pulmonary condition, disease or syndrome. Exemplary inflammatory pulmonary conditions include infection-induced pulmonary conditions such as those associated with viral, bacterial, fungal, parasite or prion infections; allergen induced pulmonary conditions; pollutant induced pulmonary conditions such as asbestosis, silicosis, or berylliosis; gastric aspiration induced pulmonary conditions, immune dysregulation, genetically induced inflammatory pulmonary conditions such as cystic fibrosis, and physical trauma induced pulmonary conditions, such as ventilator injury. These inflammatory pulmonary conditions also include asthma, emphysema, bronchitis, COPD, sarcoidosis, histiocytosis, lymphangiomyomatosis, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, chronic lung disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, community-acquired pneumonia, nosocomial pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, sepsis, viral pneumonia, influenza infection, parainfluenza infection, human metapneumovirus infection, respiratory syncitial virus infection and aspergillus or other fungal infections. \n\n\n In one aspect, there is provided a method for the treatment of an airway diseases that results from or is related to COPD, also known as chronic obstructive airway diseases, including but not limited to diseases characterized by the pathological limitation of airflow in the airway that is not fully reversible, such as for example chronic bronchitis, emphysema, pneumoconiosis, pulmonary neoplasms and other lung disorders. This method may be employed to treat COPD which is not responsive, or not adequately responsive, to treatment with existing drugs, such as with a bronchodilator, a corticosteroid, an expectorant or a methylxanthine, typically delivered by means of an inhaler or a nebulizer. Alternatively, \n\n the method of this invention, and the uses of the constructs herein, may be used to treat COPD without regard to whether the COPD is responsive, or adequately responsive, to treatment with existing drugs. \n\n\n In another aspect, there is provide a method for the treatment of asthma, including acute asthma, brachial asthma, pediatric asthma, severe asthma or chronic asthma, which is not responsive, or not adequately responsive, to treatment with a beta-agonist. Thus the patient may, by way of example and not limitation, have asthma that is not responsive, or not adequately responsive, to a conventional \"rescue inhaler\" or other inhalation device device delivering a beta-agonist such as albuterol (VENTOLIN®,\n\n\nPROVENTIL®), formoterol (FORADIL®), levalbuterol (XOPENEX®), metaproterenol (ALUPENT®), pirbuterol (MAXAIR®) or salmeterol (SEREVENT®). \n\n\n In a related aspect, there is provide a method for the treatment of asthma, including acute asthma, brachial asthma, pediatric asthma, severe asthma or chronic asthma, which is not responsive, or not adequately responsive, to treatment with a drug, substance or method intended to treat or alleviate symptoms of any form of asthma. Thus the patient may, by way of example and not limitation, have asthma that is not responsive, or not adequately responsive, to an anticholinergic agent, typically intended to enhance beta-agonist effectiveness, such as ipratrpium (ATROVENT®) or tiotropium (SPIRIVA®). Alternatively, the patient may, by way of example and not limitation, have asthma that is not responsive, or not adequately responsive, to an inhaled or systemically-administered corticosteroid, such as inhaled corticosteroids such as beclomethasone (QVAR®), budesonide (PULMICORT®), flunisolide \n\n\n(AEROBID®), fluticasone (FLOVENT®) or triamcinolone (AZMACORT®). Alternatively, the patient may, by way of example and not limitation, have asthma that is not responsive, or not adequately responsive, to a leukotriene inhibitor such as montelukast (SINGULAIR®), zafirlukast (ACCOLATE®) or zileuton (ZYFLO®). Alternatively, the patient may, by way of example and not limitation, have asthma that is not responsive, or not adequately responsive, to a methylxanthine such as theophylline (THEO-24®, THEO- DUR®). Alternatively, the patient may, by way of example and not limitation, have asthma that is not responsive, or not adequately responsive, to a mast cell inhibitor, such as cromolyn sodium (INTAL®) or nedocromil (TILADE®). Alternatively, the patient may, by way of example and not limitation, have asthma that is not responsive, or not adequately responsive, to a monoclonal antibody that binds to human immunoglobulin E such as Omalizumab (XOLAIR®). Alternatively, the patient may, by way of example and not limitation, have asthma that is not responsive, or not adequately responsive, to a combination of one or more of the foregoing and a beta agonist, including but not limited to combination therapy drugs such as ADVAIR® (fluticasone and salmeterol) and SYMBICORT® (budesonide and formoterol). \n\n\nAlternatively, the patient may, by way of example and not limitation, have asthma that is not responsive, or not adequately responsive, to a combination of two or more of the foregoing. \n\n\n The methods and uses disclosed herein may further be used for the treatment of any airway disease, condition or syndrome for which induction of anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular, renal, and/or endocrine effects are desired. Thus the constructs disclosed herein may be employed to cause desired vasodilation in a patient. \n\n\n Salt Form of Constructs. The constructs of this invention may be in the form of any \n\n\npharmaceutically acceptable salt. The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable salts\" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic or organic bases and inorganic or organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic bases include salts of aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc, and \n\n the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, Ν,Ν'- dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethyl-morpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine, and the like. \n\n\n When the construct of the present invention is basic, acid addition salts may be prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids, including inorganic and organic acids. Such acids include acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, carboxylic, citric, ethanesulfonic, formic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, malonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, propionic, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, p- toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, and the like. Acid addition salts of the constructs of this invention are prepared in a suitable solvent from the construct and an excess of an acid, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, trifluoroacetic, citric, tartaric, maleic, succinic or methanesulfonic acid. The acetate salt form is especially useful. Where the constructs of embodiments of this invention include an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts may include alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts, or alkaline earth metal salts, such as calcium or magnesium salts. \n\n\n In addition, Applicants have advantageously discovered that certain salt forms of the peptide constructs of the invention, including pamoate, octanoate, decanoate, oleate, stearate, sodium tannate and palmitate salt forms, have an increased circulation half-life, in some cases doubled, versus the corresponding acetate salt form. These salt forms are particularly well-suited for administration by subcutaneous injection or intramuscular injection, especially for chronic treatment, due to the reduced frequency of dosing that may be achieved as a result of the longer half-lives. While not being limited by theory, it is believed the increased half-life is related to a decrease in solubility in comparison to the acetate salt form. The increased half-life salt forms of the peptide constructs of the invention may be manufactured by any method including, for example, ion exchange, mixing a solution of an acetate salt form of a construct with disodium pamoate to form a pamoate suspension, or use of the desired salt during the final purification step(s) in the manufacture of the constructs. \n\n\n Pharmaceutical Compositions. Another embodiment of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition that includes a construct of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier may be a liquid formulation, and is preferably a buffered, isotonic, aqueous solution. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers also include excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as hereafter described. \n\n\n The constructs of the several embodiments of the present invention may be formulated or compounded into pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one construct of this invention together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, including excipients, such as diluents, carriers and the like, and additives, such as stabilizing agents, preservatives, solubilizing agents, buffers and the like, as may be desired. Formulation excipients may include polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, hydroxy cellulose, acacia, polyethylene glycol, manniton, sodium chloride and sodium citrate. For injection or \n\n other liquid administration formulations, water containing at least one or more buffering constituents is preferred, and stabilizing agents, preservatives and solubilizing agents may also be employed. For solid administration formulations, any of a variety of thickening, filler, bulking and carrier additives may be employed, such as starches, sugars, fatty acids and the like. For most pharmaceutical formulations, non- active ingredients will constitute the greater part, by weight or volume, of the preparation. For pharmaceutical formulations, it is also contemplated that any of a variety of measured-release, slow- release or time-release formulations and additives may be employed, so that the dosage may be formulated so as to effect delivery of a construct of this invention over a period of time. For example, gelatin, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and/or other cellulosic excipients may be included to provide time- release or slower-release formulations, especially for administration by subcutaneous and intramuscular injection. \n\n\n In general, the actual quantity of constructs administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending on the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired. \n\n\n In practical use, the constructs can be combined as the active ingredient in an admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, for example, oral, parenteral (including intravenous), urethral, vaginal, nasal, dermal, transdermal, pulmonary, deep lung, inhalation, buccal, sublingual, or the like. In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets. \n\n\n Constructs may be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active peptides may be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxy-propylcellulose. Dispersions may also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. These preparations may optionally contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. Lyophilized single unit formulations may also be utilized, which are reconstituted, such as with saline, immediately prior to administration, and thus do not require a preservative. \n\n\n The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include, for example, sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders, such as lyophilized formulations, for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that it may be administered by syringe. The form must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol, for example glycerol, propylene glycol or liquid polyethylene glycol, suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. \n\n\n Constructs as disclosed herein may be in an aqueous solution, such as a solution including saline, citrate or other common excipients or preservatives, with delivery by means such as use of a nebulizer. The constructs may also be in a dry or powder formulation, with delivery by means of a powder transport system such as a dry powder inhaler. \n\n In one aspect the methods and uses include administration of a construct directly into an airway or the lung. Intrapulmonary administration may be performed by means of a metered dose inhaler, including a device allowing self-administration of a metered bolus of a construct of this invention when actuated by a patient during inspiration. A metered dose inhaler can comprise the construct in solution in a pressurized canister that contains a propellent. Any of a variety of propellents can be employed, including hydrofluoroalkane propellants utilized with metered dose inhalers and similar devices. \n\n\n Alternatively, either dry powder inhalation or nebulized aerosols may be employed, which release a dose of the compound as either a powder aerosol or an aerosol created from an acqueous formulation.\n\n\nDry powder inhalers can be activiated upon inhalation by the patient. Nebulizers may employ compressed air or oxygen to form a jet, or may utilize a high frequency ultrasonic wave to form a vapor mist. \n\n\n In one aspect, the construct may be in a dried and particulate form, for example particles between about 0.5 and 6.0 μιη, such that the particles have sufficient mass to settle on the lung surface, and not be exhaled, but are small enough that they are not deposited on surfaces of the air passages prior to reaching the lung. Any of a variety of different techniques may be used to make dry powder \n\n\nmicroparticles, including but not limited to micro-milling, spray drying and a quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization. With micro-particles, the constructs may be deposited to the deep lung, thereby providing quick and efficient absorption into the bloodstream. Further, with such approach penetration enhancers are not required, as is sometimes the case in transdermal, nasal or oral mucosal delivery routes. Any of a variety of inhalers can be employed, including propellant-based aerosols, nebulizers, single dose dry powder inhalers and multidose dry powder inhalers. Common devices in current use include metered dose inhalers, which are used to deliver medications for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the like. Preferred devices include dry powder inhalers, designed to form a cloud or aerosol of fine powder with a particle size that is always less than about 6.0 μιη. \n\n\n If in an aqueous solution, certain constructs of the present invention may be appropriately buffered by means of saline, acetate, phosphate, citrate, acetate or other buffering agents, which may be at any physiologically acceptable pH, generally from about pH 4 to about pH 7. A combination of buffering agents may also be employed, such as phosphate buffered saline, a saline and acetate buffer, and the like. In the case of saline, a 0.9% saline solution may be employed. In the case of acetate, phosphate, citrate, acetate and the like, a 50 mM solution may be employed. In addition to buffering agents, a suitable preservative may be employed, to prevent or limit bacteria and other microbial growth. One such preservative that may be employed is 0.05% benzalkonium chloride. \n\n\n It is also possible and contemplated that the construct may be in a dried and particulate form. In a preferred embodiment, the particles are between about 0.5 and 6.0 μιη, such that the particles have sufficient mass to settle on the lung surface, and not be exhaled, but are small enough that they are not deposited on surfaces of the air passages prior to reaching the lung. Any of a variety of different techniques may be used to make dry powder microparticles, including but not limited to micro-milling, spray drying and a quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization. With micro-particles, the constructs may be deposited to the deep lung, thereby providing quick and efficient absorption into the bloodstream. Further, with such approach penetration enhancers are not required, as is sometimes the case in transdermal, nasal or oral mucosal delivery routes. Any of a variety of inhalers can be employed, including propellant-based aerosols, nebulizers, single dose dry powder inhalers and multidose dry \n\n powder inhalers. Common devices in current use include metered dose inhalers, which are used to deliver medications for the treatment of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the like.\n\n\nPreferred devices include dry powder inhalers, designed to form a cloud or aerosol of fine powder with a particle size that is always less than about 6.0 μιη. \n\n\n Microparticle size, including mean size distribution, may be controlled by means of the method of making. For micro-milling, the size of the milling head, speed of the rotor, time of processing and the like control the microparticle size. For spray drying, the nozzle size, flow rate, dryer heat and the like control the microparticle size. For making by means of quick freeze aerosol followed by lyophilization, the nozzle size, flow rate, concentration of aerosoled solution and the like control the microparticle size. These parameters and others may be employed to control the microparticle size. \n\n\n Any of a variety of dry powder inhalation formulations and compositions may be employed. This includes, by way of example and not limitation, the systems and methods as disclosed in U.S. Patents 7,521 ,068, 7,803,404 and 7,794,754, U.S. Patent Application Publication 201 1/0079318 and International Patent Publication No. WO 2009/088553; microparticle or nanoparticle compositions as disclosed in International Patent Publication Nos.

In one embodiment, there is providing a method which includes administering an amount sufficient to inhibit, reduce or decrease progression, severity, frequency, probability, duration or prevent one or more adverse physiological or psychological symptoms caused by or associated with a chronic or acute condition, disorder or disease caused by or associated with undesirable or abnormal lung or airway inflammation, asthma, or a respiratory, interstitial, or pulmonary disease or disorder. In particular aspects, a condition, disorder or disease is allergic asthma, an acute asthmatic episode, airway constriction, or lung or airway inflammation, or a respiratory, interstitial, or pulmonary disease or disorder. \n\n\n Invention treatment methods include providing a given subject with an objective or subjective improvement of the condition, disorder or disease, a symptom caused by or associated with the condition, disorder or disease, or the probability or susceptibility of a subject to the condition or a symptom caused by or associated with the condition, disorder or disease. In various embodiments, treatment reduces, decreases, inhibits, delays, eliminates or prevents the probability, susceptibility, severity, frequency, or duration of one or more symptoms caused by or associated with the condition, disorder or disease. In a particular aspect, a method inhibits, reduces or decreases the probability, severity, frequency or duration of a subject from having an acute asthmatic episode (e.g., an acute asthmatic episode caused by an allergen, allergic asthma or exercise). In another particular aspect, a method reduces the probability, severity, frequency or duration, or delays, halts, or prevents, airway constriction. In additional aspects, treatment improves or increases airway dilation. In further aspects, a treatment improves asthma, reduces or inhibits lung or airway inflammation, or reduces or inhibits a symptom caused by or associated with a respiratory, interstitial, or pulmonary disease or disorder. \n\n\n Candidate subjects for methods of the invention include mammals, such as humans. Candidate subjects for methods of the invention also include subjects that are in need of treatment, e.g., any subject \n\n that may benefit from a treatment. Candidate subjects for methods of the invention therefore include subjects that have or are at risk of having a condition, disorder or disease caused by or associated with asthma, lung or airway inflammation, or a respiratory, interstitial, or pulmonary disease or disorder. In particular aspects, a subject has been diagnosed as having asthma, lung or airway inflammation, or a respiratory, interstitial, or pulmonary disease or disorder, or is at risk of having asthma, lung or airway inflammation, or a respiratory, interstitial, or pulmonary disease or disorder. \n\n\n Routes of Administration. One preferred route of administration of a construct for prophylaxis or treatment of airway disease is by administration directly into an airway or the lung. By way of example,\n\n\nIntrapulmonary administration may be performed by means of a metered dose inhaler, a device allowing self-administration of a metered bolus of a construct of this invention when actuated by a patient during inspiration. Both dry powder inhalation and nebulized aerosols may be employed for administration into an airway or the lung. \n\n\n If a construct for prophylaxis or treatment of airway disease is systemically administered, it may be administered by injection, and the injection may be intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or other means known in the art. The constructs of this invention may further be formulated by any means known in the art, including but not limited to formulation as tablets, capsules, caplets, suspensions, powders, lyophilized preparations, suppositories, ocular drops, skin patches, oral soluble formulations, sprays, aerosols and the like, and may be mixed and formulated with buffers, binders, excipients, stabilizers, anti-oxidants and other agents known in the art. In general, any route of administration by which the constructs of this invention are introduced across an epidermal layer of cells may be employed. Administration means may thus include administration through mucous membranes, buccal administration, oral administration, dermal administration, inhalation administration, pulmonary administration, nasal administration, urethral administration, vaginal administration, and the like. \n\n\n In one aspect, a construct of this invention is administered by means of a time-release injectable formulation, such as a construct of this invention in a formulation with a PEG, poly(ortho ester) or PLGA polymer. In another aspect, a construct of this invention is administered by means of an automated delivery device providing subcutaneous delivery, either continuous or intermittent. Any of the foregoing methods and formulations are particularly applicable for treatment of chronic conditions or syndromes, including airway diseases such as asthma or COPD. \n\n\n Therapeutically Effective Amount. In general, in the methods and uses of this invention the actual quantity of a construct administered to a patient will vary between fairly wide ranges depending upon the mode of administration, the formulation used, and the response desired. The dosage for treatment is administration, by any of the foregoing means or any other means known in the art, of an amount sufficient to bring about the desired therapeutic effect. Thus, a therapeutically effective amount includes an amount of a construct or pharmaceutical composition of this invention that is sufficient to induce a desired effect, including but not limited to inhibition of airway reactivity, inhibition of airway inflammation or airway remodeling. \n\n\n Methods of the invention can be practiced by administration or contact with any dose amount, frequency, delivery route or timing of a construct as disclosed herein. In particular embodiments, a subject is administered or contacted construct as disclosed herein one, two, three, four or more times hourly, daily, biweekly, weekly, monthly or annually. In additional embodiments, an amount administered is about 0.00001 mg/kg, to about 10,000 mg/kg, about 0.0001 mg/kg, to about 1000 mg/kg, about 0.001 mg/kg, to \n\n about 100 mg/kg, about 0.01 mg/kg, to about 10 mg/kg, about 0.1 mg/kg, to about 1 mg/kg body weight, one, two, three, four, or more times per hour, day, biweekly, week, month or annually. In further embodiments, the amount administered is less than about 0.001 mg/kg, such as between about 0.0001 and 0.0005 mg/kg, administered one, two, three, four, or more times per hour, day, biweekly, week, month or annually. In particular aspects, the amount is administered substantially contemporaneously with, or within about 1 -60 minutes, hours, or days of the onset of a symptom caused by or associated with asthma, lung or airway inflammation, or a respiratory, interstitial, or pulmonary disease or disorder. \n\n\n Combination Therapy \n\n\n It is also possible and contemplated that the methods and uses of this invention include use of constructs in combination with other drugs or agents. In certain embodiments, an effective amount of one or more constructs is administered in combination with an effective amount of one or more therapies used for preventing, treating, managing, or ameliorating asthma. Non-limiting examples of therapies for asthma include anti-cholinergics (e.g., ipratropium bromide and oxitropium bromide), beta-2 agonists (e.g., albuterol (PROVENTIL® or VENTOLIN®), bitolterol (TOMALATEL®), fenoterol, formoterol, isoetharine, metaproterenol, pibuterol (MAXAIR®), salbutamol, salbutamol terbutaline, and salmeterol, terbutlaine (BRETHAIREL®)), corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, beclomethasone dipropionate (VANCERIL® or BECLOVENT®), triamcinolone acetonide (AZMACORF®), flunisolide (AEROBID®), and fluticasone propionate (FLOVENT®)), leukotriene antagonists (e.g., montelukast, zafirluckast, and zileuton), theophylline (THEO-DUR®, UNIDU® tablets, and SLO-BID® Gyrocaps), and salmeterol (SEREVENT®), cromolyn, and nedorcomil (INTAL® and TILADE®)), IgE antagonists, IL-4 antagonists (including antibodies), IL-5 antagonists (including antibodies), PDE4 inhibitors, NF-Kappa-B inhibitors, IL-13 antagonists (including antibodies), CpG, CD23 antagonists, selectin antagonist (e.g., TBC 1269), mast cell protease inhibitors, tryptase kinase inhibitors (e.g., GW-45, GW-58, and genisteine), \n\n\nphosphatidylinositide-3' (PI3)-kinase inhibitors (e.g., calphostin C), other kinase inhibitors (e.g., staurosporine), C2a receptor antagonists (including antibodies), and supportive respiratory therapy, such as supplemental and mechanical ventilation. In certain embodiments, the method comprises \n\n\nadministration of an effective amount of a construct in combination of one or more supportive measures to a subject to prevent, treat, manage, or ameliorate asthma or one or more symptoms thereof. Non-limiting examples of supportive measures include humidification of air by ultrasonic nebulizer, aerolized racemic epinephrine, oral dexamethasone, intravenous fluids, intubation, fever reducers (e.g., ibuprofen and acetametaphine), and antibiotic, anti-viral, or anti-fungal therapy (i.e., to prevent or treat secondary respiratory infections). \n\n\n In general a construct of this invention, including the construct of formula IV, may be used in combination with a long acting beta agonist, a short acting beta agonist, a long acting muscarinic antagonist, a short acting muscarinic antagonist, a bifunctional muscaricic antagonist and beta agonist, or a corticosteroid. In one aspect, a construct of this invention, including the construct of formula IV, is formulated with one of the foregoing in a formulation adapted for administration directly into an airway or the lung, such as by inhalation therapy. Thus by way of example a construct of formula IV can be combined with one or more of an inhaled corticosteroid, an inhaled muscarinic antagonist or an inhaled beta agonist. In another aspect, a construct of this invention, including the construct of formula IV, is formulated with one of the foregoing in a formulation adapted for parenteral administration. Thus by way of example a construct of formula IV can be combined with one or more of a parenteral form of a steroid, \n\n such as hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, for administration by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous means. \n\n\n Synthetic Methods of Amino Acid Surrogates \n\n\n The following examples of methods of synthesis of amino acid surrogates utilized in the invention are intended to be exemplary, and it is to be understood that variations thereon may be undertaken by one of skill in the art, and such variations are intended to be included herein. \n\n\n Method A: (2-Fmoc-amino-3- R'-0-propylamino)-2-substituted acetic acid methyl esters (10) were prepared by reductive amination of Fmoc O-protected serinal (9) with a-amino esters (2), using either sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride as the reducing agent. The Fmoc O- protected serinal (9) required for the reductive amination was prepared according to method D, either by reduction of the ester (12) by di-isobutylaluminun hydride, by oxidation of Fmoc O-protected serinol (13) with Dess-Martin periodinane, or by reduction of the Fmoc O-protected serine Weinreb amide (14) with lithium aluminum hydride. The preferred method for the preparation of Fmoc O-protected serinals (9) was the reduction of the Weinreb amide analog. (2-Fmoc-amino-3- R'-0-propylamino)-2-substituted acetic acid methyl esters (10) were then N and O deprotected, cyclized, and Fmoc protected to give 3-substituted 6- hydroxymehyl-piperazin-2-ones (6), which were then oxidized to the final product as described in method A. \n\n\n The protecting group (R') on the hydroxyl group of Fmoc-O-protected serinal (9) used in the synthesis depends on the nature of the side chain R of the amino ester. When R contained no functional groups, the side chain of Fmoc serine was protected as the \nf\nBu ether. When R contained functional groups, the side chain of Fmoc serine was protected as the trityl ether. \n\n\n Method A \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod B \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n (11) (14) (9) \n\n\n Method B: Synthesis of various Fmoc-O-protected serinals (9).

The reaction mixture was then poured over 500 mL of water, and the solid filtered. The solid was redissolved in 800 mL of ethyl acetate, and washed with 1 x 200 mL of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated. No purification was required. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Synthesis of Fmoc-O-R' serinol (13): To a solution of 10.0 mmol of Fmoc O-R' serine (1 1 ) in 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, kept at -20 °C under nitrogen, was added 1.77 mL (12.7 mmol) of triethyl amine, followed by the slow addition of 1.57 mL (12.0 mmol) of isobutylchloroformate. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, and then poured slowly over an ice-cold solution of 3.77 g (99.6 mmol) of sodium borohydride in 10 mL of water, keeping the temperature below 5 °C. The reaction was stirred at 0 °C for 15 minutes, and then quenched with 1 N hydrochloric acid solution. The reaction mixture was diluted with 100 mL of ethyl acetate, and the layers separated. The organic layer was washed with 2 x 25 mL of 1 N hydrochloric acid solution, 2 x 25 mL of water, dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated.

Such conventional procedures include, for example, any solution phase procedure permitting a condensation between the free alpha amino group of an amino acid residue having its carboxyl group or other reactive groups protected and the free primary carboxyl group of another amino acid residue having its amino group or other reactive groups protected. In a preferred conventional procedure, the constructs of this invention may be synthesized by solid-phase synthesis and purified according to methods known in the art. The amino acid surrogates of the present invention may be incorporated into constructs of this invention by methods substantially similar to or identical to those employed with residues. Any of a number of well-known procedures utilizing a variety of resins and reagents may be used to prepare the constructs of this invention. \n\n\n The process for synthesizing the constructs may be carried out by a procedure whereby each amino acid or amino acid surrogate in the desired sequence is added one at a time in succession to another amino acid residue or amino acid surrogate or by a procedure whereby peptide fragments with the desired amino acid sequence, which may include one or more amino acid surrogates, are first synthesized conventionally and then condensed to provide the desired construct. The resulting construct is cyclized to yield a cyclic construct of the invention. \n\n\n Solid phase peptide synthesis methods are well known and practiced in the art. In such methods the synthesis of constructs of the invention can be carried out by sequentially incorporating the desired amino acid residues or amino acid surrogates one at a time into the growing peptide chain according to the general principles of solid phase methods. These methods are disclosed in numerous references, including Merrifield R.B., Solid phase synthesis (Nobel lecture). Angew. Chem. 24:799-810 (1985) and Barany et al., The Peptides, Analysis, Synthesis and Biology, Vol. 2, Gross E. and Meienhofer J., Eds. Academic Press, 1-284 (1980). \n\n\n In chemical syntheses of constructs, reactive side chain groups of the various amino acid residues or amino acid surrogates are protected with suitable protecting groups, which prevent a chemical reaction from occurring at that site until the protecting group is removed. Also common is the protection of the alpha amino group of an amino acid residue or amino acid surrogate while that entity reacts at the carboxyl group, followed by the selective removal of the alpha amino protecting group to allow a subsequent reaction to take place at that site. Specific protecting groups have been disclosed and are \n\n known in solid phase synthesis methods and solution phase synthesis methods. \n\n\n Alpha amino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, including a urethane-type protecting group, such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyl, such as p- chlorobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-bromobenzyloxycarbonyl, p-biphenyl- isopropoxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Moz); \n\n\naliphatic urethane-type protecting groups, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, isopropoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl. Fmoc is preferred for alpha amino protection. \n\n\n Guanidino groups may be protected by a suitable protecting group, such as nitro, p- toluenesulfonyl (Tos), Z, pentamethylchromanesulfonyl (Pmc), adamantyloxycarbonyl, \n\n\npentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (Pbf), Fmoc and Boc. Pbf is one preferred protecting group for Arg. Other preferred protecting groups include Z, Fmoc, and Boc. It is to be understood that particularly guanidino protecting groups may be cleaved and removed during the synthetic process, or may alternatively not be cleaved or removed, in which event the side chain with the protecting group forms a derivative of an amino acid side chain moiety as defined herein. Particularly where the protecting group is labile, and may be removed by some mechanism in vivo upon administration to a patient, the construct becomes a \"prodrug\", which is to say a construct that is a drug precursor which, following administration to a patient, is converted to the desired drug form in vivo via some chemical or physiological process (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to physiological pH or through enzyme action is converted to the desired drug form). \n\n\n The constructs of the invention described herein can be prepared using solid phase synthesis, either manually or by means of an automated peptide synthesizer, using programming modules as provided by the manufacturer and following the protocols set forth by the manufacturer, or by \n\n\nmodifications of the manufacturers's protocols to improve the yield of difficult couplings. \n\n\n Solid phase synthesis is commenced from the C-terminal end of the construct by coupling a protected a-amino acid, a-amino acid surrogate or a-amino alcohol mimetic to a suitable resin. Such starting material is prepared by attaching an oamino-protected amino acid or oamino-protected amino acid surrogate by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin or a 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin, by an amide bond between an Fmoc-Linker, such as p-[(R, S)-o[1-(9H-fluor-en-9-yl)- methoxyformamido]-2,4-dimethyloxybenzyl]-phenoxyacetic acid (Rink linker) to a benzhydrylamine (BHA) resin, or by other means well known in the art, such as by attaching an oamino-protected alcohol mimetic to 3,4-dihydro-2/-/-pyran-2yl-methanol linker attached to chloromethyl polystyrene resin. Fmoc-Linker- BHA resin supports are commercially available and generally used when feasible. The resins are carried through repetitive cycles as necessary to add amino acids sequentially. The alpha amino Fmoc protecting groups are removed under basic conditions. Piperidine, piperazine, diethylamine, or morpholine (20-40% v/v) in Ν,Ν-dimethylformamide (DMF) may be used for this purpose. \n\n\n Following removal of the alpha amino protecting group, the subsequent protected amino acids or amino acid surrogates are coupled stepwise in the desired order to obtain an intermediate, protected peptide-resin. The activating reagents used for coupling of the amino acids in the solid phase synthesis of the peptides are well known in the art. After the construct is synthesized, if desired, the orthogonally protected side chain protecting groups may be removed using methods well known in the art for further derivatization of the construct. \n\n\n Reactive groups in a construct can be selectively modified, either during solid phase synthesis or \n\n after removal from the resin. For example, constructs can be modified to obtain N-terminus modifications, such as acetylation, while on resin, or may be removed from the resin by use of a cleaving reagent and then modified. Methods for N-terminus modification, such as acetylation, or C-terminus modification, such as amidation or introduction of an N-acetyl group, are known in the art. Similarly, methods for modifying side chains of amino acids are well known to those skilled in the art of peptide synthesis. The choice of modifications made to reactive groups present on the construct will be determined, in part, by the characteristics that are desired in the construct. \n\n\n The construct are, in one embodiment, cyclized prior to cleavage from the resin. For cyclization through reactive side chain moieties, the desired side chains are deprotected, and the construct suspended in a suitable solvent and a cyclic coupling agent added. Suitable solvents include, for example DMF, dichloromethane (DCM) or 1 -methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Suitable cyclic coupling reagents include, for example, 2-(1 H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1 ,1 ,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 2-(1 H- benzotriazol-1-yl)-1 , 1 ,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy- tris(dimethylamino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (BOP), benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy- tris(pyrrolidino)phosphoniumhexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), 2-(7-aza-1 H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1 , 1 ,3,3- tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TATU), 2-(2-oxo-1 (2H)-pyridyl)-1 ,1 ,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TPTU) or N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole (DCCI/HOBt). \n\n\nCoupling is conventionally initiated by use of a suitable base, such as Ν,Ν-diispropylethylamine (DIPEA), sym-collidine or N-methylmorpholine (NMM). \n\n\n Following cleavage of constructs from the solid phase following synthesis, the construct can be purified by any number of methods, such as reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP- HPLC), using a suitable column, such as a d\n8\n column. Other methods of separation or purification, such as methods based on the size or charge of the construct, can also be employed. Once purified, the construct can be characterized by any number of methods, such as high performance liquid \n\n\nchromatograph (HPLC), amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and the like. \n\n\n Constructs of the present invention with a substituted amide derivative C-terminus, typically an N- alkyl group, are prepared by solid phase synthesis commenced from the C-terminal end of the construct by coupling a protected alpha amino acid or amino acid surrogate to a suitable resin. Such methods for preparing substituted amide derivatives on solid phase have been described in the art. See, for example, Barn D.R., Morphy J.R., Rees D.C. Synthesis of an array of amides by aluminum chloride assisted cleavage of resin-bound esters. Tetrahedron Lett. 37, 3213-3216 (1996); DeGrado W. F. Kaiser E. T. Solid-phase synthesis of protected peptides on a polymer bound oxime: Preparation of segments comprising the sequences of a cytotoxic 26-peptide analogue. J. Org. Chem. 47:3258-3261 (1982). Such starting material can be prepared by attaching an alpha amino-protected amino acid or amino acid surrogate by an ester linkage to a p-benzyloxybenzyl alcohol (Wang) resin by well known means. The peptide chain is grown with the desired sequence of amino acids or amino acid surrogates, the product cyclized and resin-treated with a solution of appropriate amine and aluminum choride (such as methyl amine, dimethyl amine, ethylamine, and so on) in dichloromethane. The resulting amide derivative construct is released in solution from the resin. The resin is filtered and the amide derivative construct recovered by concentration of solvent followed by precipitation with ether. The crude construct is dried and remaining amino acid side chain protective groups cleaved using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in the presence of water and triisopropylsilane (TIS). The final product is precipitated by adding cold ether and \n\n collected by filtration. Final purification is by RP-HPLC using a d\n8\n column. \n\n\n In one preferred method, the constructs of formula III are synthesized by the following methods.\n\n\nEach of the constructs has one or two amino acid surrogates based on a keto-piperazine structure. The amino acid surrogates are synthesized as described above. The constructs are synthesized using Fmoc chemistry. A manual synthetic approach is used for couplings immediately before and after incorporation of the keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate. \n\n\n The following protocol was employed to attach an amino acid surrogate to resin, such as where the amino acid surrogate was in a terminal position. Rink amide resin (loading at 0.3 mmol/g, Advanced\n\n\nChemTech) was allowed to swell in DMF for 30 minutes. Fmoc deprotection of the resin was \n\n\naccomplished using 20% piperidine/DMF for 20 minutes. Coupling of the resin with the selected Fmoc- protected keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate (2 eq) was accomplished by overnight incubation in DMF with PyBop (2 eq) and DIEA (4 eq). If following Kaiser testing a positive result was obtained, the coupling reaction was conducting a second time. Acetylation was carried out using Ac\n2\n0 (10 eq) and pyridine (20 eq) in DMF. \n\n\n The following protocol was employed to attach a keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate to peptide- resin. Coupling was carried out by mixing Fmoc-protected keto piperzine amino acid surrogate (2 eq), TBTU (2 eq) and DIEA (4 eq) in DMF and allowing to incubate overnight, again with a repeat of the coupling reaction if a positive Kaiser test obtained. Acetylation was carried out using Ac\n2\n0 (10 eq) and pyridine (20 eq) in DMF. \n\n\n The following protocol was employed to couple an Fmoc-protected amino acid to a keto- piperazine amino acid surrogate on solid phase. In most instances at least two coupling cycles were needed, and frequently three cycles were employed. In a typical cycle Fmoc-protected amino acid (4 eq) was mixed with HOAt (4 eq) and DIC (4 eq) in DMF. The resulting mixture was then mixed overnight in a SPE tube with a keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate attached directly or through intermediates to resin. \n\n\n Couplings between amino acids that were not directly adjacent to a keto-piperazine amino acid surrogate in the sequence were conducted using standard protocols for solid phase peptide synthesis. The following protecting groups were employed: Boc for Lys and Orn, f-Butyl for Tyr and Ser, Trityl for Cys and His, O-f-Butyl for Asp and Pbf for Arg. \n\n\n Constructs were cleaved from resin employing a mixture of TFA/thioanisole/phenol/H\n2\n0/DTT/TIS (87.5/2.5/2.5/5/2.5/1 1 ) (5 mL) for 3 hours. The resulting material was filtered and precipitated from cold ether under freezing conditions for one hour. Precipitated cysteinyl peptide was washed with cold ether at least three times before being use in an oxidation step. \n\n\n For cyclization to form disulfide bonds via air oxidation, crude cysteinyl construct was dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile and water. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 7-8 using 5% NH\n4\nOH. The resulted solution was stirred slowly with 150 mg granular activated carbon for 2 days. Completion of cyclization was confirmed by LC-MS analysis before proceding to the next process step. After cyclization, solid carbon was filtered from solution. The filtrate was lyophilized or dried in a speed-vac to obtain crude cyclic construct. \n\n\n Certain constructs of the invention, where the surrogate is bound to resin or other peptide solid support and is at the C-terminal position, may be synthesized by means of the following scheme. The following scheme is exemplified by synthesis of the construct of formula IV, but it is to be understood that substantially similar methods may be employed for any construct wherein the surrogate is bound to resin \n\n or other peptide solid support. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Surrogate (7) is prepared by the scheme of method A above, or any alternative method. Fmoc protected Sieber amide resin was treated by swelling 23.8 g (0.63 mmol/g substitution, 15 mmol) of the resin in 200 mL of a 1 :1 mixture of dimethylformamide and dichloromethane for 45 minutes, followed by filtering and washing with 2 x 125 mL of dimethylformamide. The washed resin was then deprotected with 2 x 125 mL of 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide for 15 minutes, filtered, and washed with 4 x 125 mL of dimethylformamide. \n\n\n A solution of 21 .5 g (MW = 717, 30 mmol) of Fmoc-protected surrogate (7) in 160 mL of dimethylformamide was added to the deprotected Sieber amide resin as prepared above, followed by 15.6 g (MW = 520.3, 30 mmol) of solid PyBop, and 10.4 mL (MW = 129.25, d = 0.742, 60 mmol) of diisopropylethylamine, followed by another 40 mL of dimethylformamide. The mixture was agitated overnight with nitrogen bubbling. The resin was filtered, and washed with 4 x 130 mL of \n\n\ndimethylformamide, capped with 150 mL of capping solution consisting of a 3:2:1 solution of \n\n\ndimethylformamide:acetic anhydride:pyridine for 30 minutes, filtered, and washed with 4 x 130 mL of dimethylformamide to provide surrogate (7) complexed to resin. \n\n\n The resulting Fmoc-protected surrogate (7) complexed to resin was deprotected with 2 x 130 mL of 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide for 15 minutes, filtered, and washed with 4 x 130 mL of dimethylformamide to yield surrogate (7) complexed to resin. A solution of 27.6 g of Fmoc-Tyr-(tBu)-OH (60 mmol, 4 eq.) in dimethylformamide (200 mL) was added to surrogate (7) complexed to resin, followed by a solution of 24.8 g of HCTU (60 mmol, 4 eq.), and 20.8 mL (120 mmol, 8 eq.) of \n\n\ndiisopropylethylamine in DMF to a final volume of 200 mL and coupled overnight with nitrogen bubbling. The resulting Fmoc-Tyr-(tBu)-surrogate (7)-resin was isolated by filtration and washed with 2 x 130 mL of dimethylformamide. In order to ensure complete coupling, the product was again treated with a solution of 27.6 g of Fmoc-Tyr-(tBu)-OH (MW = 459.6, 60 mmol, 4 eq.) in dimethylformamide to a final volume of 200 mL followed by a solution of 24.8 g of HCTU (60 mmol, 4 eq.), and diisopropylethylamine (20.8 mL, 120 mmol, 8 eq.) in DMF to a final volume of 200 mL and coupled overnight with nitrogen bubbling. The resin was filtered, and washed with 2 x 130 mL of dimethylformamide. HPLC and LC/MS showed that coupling between surrogate (7)-resin and Fmoc-Tyr-(tBu)-OH was complete. \n\n\n The resulting Fmoc-Tyr-(tBu)-surrogate (7)-resin was then capped with 150 mL of capping solution as above for 30 minutes. The resin was then filtered, washed with 4 x 130 mL of \n\n dimethylformamide, 4 x 130 mL of dichloromethane, 2 x 130 mL of MeOH, 2 x 130 mL of diethyl ether, and dried under vacuum to give 36.7 g. \n\n\n Thereafter each succeeding amino acid may be coupled. Before the coupling of the first amino acid, resulting Fmoc-Tyr-(tBu)-surrogate (7)-resin was swollen for 45 minutes with 200 mL of a 1 :1 solution of dimethylformamide:dichloromethane. Each amino acid (Fmoc-AA-OH) was coupled by repeating the following cycle. The terminal amino acid residue was deprotected with 2 x 125 mL of 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide for 15 minutes, filtered and washed with 4 x 125 mL of \n\n\ndimethylformamide. The beads were checked by ninhydrin test. A solution of Fmoc-AA-OH (60 mmol, 4 eq.) in dimethylformamide to a final volume of 200 mL was added to resin, followed by a solution of HBTU (60 mmol, 4 eq.), and (120 mmol, 8 eq.) of N-methylmorpholine in DMF to a final volume of 200 mL \n\n\n [concentration of Fmoc-AA-OH = 150 mM solution] and coupled for 30 minutes with nitrogen bubbling\n\n\n(coupling reaction checked by ninhydrin test). When the ninhydrin test was negative, the resin was filtered, and washed with 4 x 130 mL of dimethylformamide. \n\n\n After all amino acids had been coupled, the resin was washed with 4 x 130 mL of \n\n\ndichloromethane, 4 x 130 mL of methanol, 4 x 130 mL of diethyl ether, and dried under vacuum to give product. The weight increase was quantitative. \n\n\n 100 mL of cleavage reagent consisting of a 81 .5:5:5:5:2.5: 1 solution of trifluoroacetic \n\n\nacid:phenol:thioanisole:water:DDT:triisopropyl silane was added to 32 g (~ 6.4 mmol) of the following linear construct: \n\n\n\n\n\n The suspension was allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes and then filtered. \n\n\nAnother 100 mL of cleavage reagent was added to the resin, allowed to stand for 5 minutes, and filtered. This process was repeated. \n\n\n The resulting resin was then washed with 2 x 40 mL of trifluoroacetic acid. The filtrates were combined and stirred for 2.5 hours at room temperature, and then concentrated under reduced pressure to ~ 100 mL volume. Cold diethyl ether (1.5 L, pre-cooled to -20 °C) was added to the filtrate, and then placed in the freezer (-20 °C) for 1 hour, filtered through a sintered glass funnel, and the solids washed with 3 x 200 mL of cold diethyl ether, and then dried under vacuum for 1 hour with the solids triturated every 15 minutes to make sure solvent was removed efficiently. The following construct was obtained (15.4 g) (103% overall crude yield): \n\n\nHept-Cys-His-Phe-D-Ala-Gly-Arg-D-Nle-As \n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The above construct (15.4 g, 6.4 mmol) was dissolved in 16 L of 30% acetonitrile in water. The pH was adjusted to 8.4 using a solution of 5% ammonium hydroxide. Pulverized activated carbon (15.4 g) was added, and the suspension stirred overnight. The carbon was removed by filtration through celite. The celite was washed 3 x 100 mL 50% acetonitrile in water. The filtrates were combined, diluted with water to a final concentration of 10% acetonitrile, and loaded in the column for purification. Purification of \n\n the trifluoroacetate salt of the resulting construct was performed under the following conditions: \n\n\n Column: Luna d\n8\n, 10 μ, 50 x 33 mm \n\n\n Flow: 70 mL/minute \n\n\n Solvent A: water containing 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid \n\n\n Solvent B: acetonitrile containing 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid \n\n\n Gradient: 5% solvent B for 5 minutes \n\n\n 26% B to 52% B in 30 minutes \n\n\n The pure fractions were combined and lyophilized to give the purified trifluoroacetate salt of the construct. Dowex SBR, LCNG-OH resin (450g) was suspended in 2 L of water, and gently stirred for 15 minutes, allowed to stand for 15 minutes, and then decanted. The procedure was repeated, and then 0.5 L of water added, and the slurry transferred into a 6 x 60 cm column. The water was drained, washed with 4 L of water, and ions exchanged with 6.5 L of 20% acetic acid solution. The resin was allowed to stand at room temperature overnight, and then washed with water until the pH of the filtrate was ~ 4 (8 L of water used). The trifluoroacetate salt of the above construct (1 1.1 g), as prepared above, was dissolved in 80 mL of water, and loaded to the ion exchange resin, and eluted with water. Fractions containing 79-1 were combined, and 20% acetic acid solution was added to adjust the final concentration to 5% acetic acid, and then lyophilized. The construct of formula IV (10.4 g) was obtained: \n\n\nHept-C \n2\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Similar methods may be employed with any construct where the surrogate is bound to resin or other peptide solid support and is at the C-terminal position. \n\n\n Optional PEGylation of the peptide constructs of the invention may be performed in any manner, such as those described below. \n\n\n PEGylation of reactive amine groups, such as lysine or ornithine side chains, an omega amino aliphatic in position Aaa , or an amine group in J of an amino acid surrogate at Aaa \n5\n, was accomplished by dissolving 0.005 mmol purified construct in 2 mL of dimethylsulfoxide, followed by the addition of 55.5 mg (0.01 1 mmol, 2 eq) of PEG-5K-OSu (5,000 Da MW methoxy-PEG with a succinimidyl propionate reactive group), with 17.7 μί (0.13 mmol, 20 eq.) of triethyl amine then added, and the slightly cloudy solution stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. Excess PEG-5K-OSu was quenched by the addition of 7 \\}L (0.1 1 1 mmol, 10 eq.) of ethanol amine, and the reaction stirred overnight. \n\n\n PEGylation of reactive carboxyl groups, such as Asp or Glu side chains or a terminal carboxyl at\n\n\nAaa\n15\n on either a residue or surrogate, is accomplished by coupling PEG-NH\n2\n (PEG-amine), to the construct containing a carboxylate group in the side chain of Asp or Glu or at the C-terminus. The peptide construct (0.005 mmol) is dissolved in DMSO (2 mL), followed by the addition of 55.5 mg (0.01 1 mmol, 2 eq) of PEG-NH\n2\n and HOBt (0.01 mmol). The coupling is started by the addition of 0.0055 mmole of coupling reagent N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDAC). The slightly cloudy solution stirred at room temperature overnight. The PEGylated peptide construct is then purified by HPLC. \n\n\n PEGylation of reactive thiol groups, such as Cys or Hcys side chains or a thiol group in Q of an amino acid surrogate at Aaa\n1\n , is accomplished by treating the peptide construct in DMSO with PEG- \n\n methyl-maleimide reagent (SunBio, Orinda, California) overnight. The PEGylated peptide construct is then purified by HPLC. \n\n\n Following PEGylation, the resulting crude mixture was then purified by HPLC, yielding a PEG derivatized construct including one or more amino acid surrogates. \n\n\nIn Vitro and In Vivo Test Systems \n\n\n Selected constructs were tested in assays to determine binding and functional status. The following assays were employed. \n\n\n Cell culture. A cDNA clone that encodes for human natriuratic peptide receptor A (NPRA) was purchased from Bio S&T Inc. (Montreal, Quebec). The cDNA clone was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and transfected into HEK-293 cells. Stable clones were selected by culture of cells in the presence of G418 sulfate. Expression of NPRA was examined by binding of [ \n25\nl]-atrial natriuretic peptide ([ \n25\nI]-ANP) to membrane homogenates prepared from clonal cell lines. HEK-hNPRA cells were maintained in culture at 37 °C in 5% C0\n2\n in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, G418 sulfate (300 pg/mL) sodium glutamate (0.29 mg/mL), penicillin (100 units/mL) and streptromycin (100 ug/mL). \n\n\n Competitive binding assay. A competitive inhibition binding assay was performed using crude membrane homogenates prepared from HEK-hNPRA cells. To prepare membrane homogenates, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 15 minutes at 4 °C in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 + 5 mM EDTA). Cells were transferred from plates to polypropylene tubes and homogenized. Homogenates were centrifuged at 25,000 x g for 20 minutes. Pellets were resuspended in buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 1 mM EDTA, homogenized and centrifuged at 25,000 x g for 20 minutes. Pellets were resuspended in buffer consisting of 100 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and 10 mM MgCI\n2\n and stored at -80 °C until needed. On the day of an assay, homogenates were thawed and homogenized. Binding of [ \n25\nI]-ANP was carried out in buffer containing 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCI, 2 mM CaCI\n2\n, 5 mM MgCI\n2\n, 0.1 % BSA and 1 mM 1 , 10-phenanthroline. Homogenates (1 -10 pg protein/well) were incubated with [ \n25\nI]-ANP (25-30 pM) and increasing concentrations of competing ligands in Millipore filter plates for 120 minutes at 4 °C. Assays were stopped by addition of cold wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline) followed by filtration using a vacuum manifold. Bound radioactivity was determined using a gamma counter. Non-specific binding was defined by binding of [l \n25\n]-hANP to non-transfected HEK293 membranes. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism\n®\n curve-fitting software. \n\n\n General method for determination of EC\n50\n. Functional evaluation of constructs was performed by measuring the accumulation of intracellular cGMP in HEK-293 cells that express recombinant hNPR-A. HEK-NPRA cells were harvested by washing and centrifugation in Cell Dissociation Buffer (Gibco, Life Technologies). Pelleted cells were resuspended in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) containing 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCI\n2\n, 200 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM 1 , 10-phenanthroline and BSA (0.5 mg/mL). Following centrifugation, cells were resuspended in the above buffer supplemented with 0.5 mM 3- isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Cells (~2 x10\n5\n/well) were added to each well of a 96-well plate and incubated for 15 minutes at 37 °C. Following the pre-incubation period, cells were incubated for an additional 15 minutes in the presence of increasing concentrations of constructs. The reaction was terminated by lysis of the cells with temperature shock. The reaction plate was incubated in a dry ice/ethanol bath for 15 minutes followed by incubation at 90 °C for 10 minutes. Accumulation of cGMP was measured using the cGMP Flashplate RIA (Perkin-Elmer). Data analysis and EC\n50\n values were \n\n determined by using nonlinear regression analysis with GraphPad Prism\n®\n software. \n\n\n Determination of mass and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. The mass values of PEG- conjugated constructs were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (positive ion mode) using alpha- cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) as matrix. Methanol was used for sample preparation in construct to matrix ratios of 1 : 10, 1 :20 and 1 :30. Alternatively other matrices such as, sinapinic acid (SA) and 2, 5- dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), and solvents such acetonitrile - 0.1 % aqueous TFA can be used for sample preparation. Other determinations of mass values were made using a Waters MicroMass ZQ device utilizing a positive mode. For consructs that were not PEGylated, mass determinations were compared with calculated values and expressed in the form of mass weight plus two divided by two ((M+2)/2), unless otherwise specified. \n\n\n Proton NMR data was obtained using a Bruker 300 MHz spectrometer. The spectra were obtained after dissolving constructs in a deuteriated solvent such as chloroform, DMSO, or methanol as appropriate. \n\n\n HPLC measurements were made using a Waters Alliance HT with a YMC Pack Pro C\n18\n column (4.6 x 50 mm, 3 μ) eluted at 1 mL/minute in a step-wise procedure. Solvent A (water containing 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid v/v) and solvent B (acetonitrile containing 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid v/v) were used as mobile phases. For analysis of keto piperazine intermediates, the column was equilibrated with 10% B and then B was increased to 90% over a period of 8 minutes. For analysis of peptides, the column was equilibrated with 2% B and then B was increased to 90% over a period of 8 minutes. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 1 \n\n\n The construct of formula IV having the following structure was synthesized as described above: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The resulting construct had formula of C\n82\nH-i27N2702oS2 as the anhydrous, counter-ion free peptide and a molecular weight of 1875.22, determined as the average mass of the anhydrous, counter-ion free peptide. In the solid state form, the construct is a white to off-white solid with acetate as the associated counter- ion. The specific rotation of the construct as a 1.0% solution in water at 25°C was found, after correction for construct content, to be: \n\n\n [a£\n5\n = -26.9°. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 2 \n\n\n A formulation of the construct of formula IV was made for pharmaceutical use. The construct of formula IV was used in the acetate salt form. The formulation was dispensed into a vial which was stoppered and sealed, with each vial containing: \n\n\n 1 mg of the construct of formula IV, based on peptide weight net of acetate 1.181 mg succinic acid, NF \n\n\n 47.0 mg mannitol, USP \n\n\n 1 N NaOH, USP, as needed to adjust pH \n\n\n 1 N HCI, USP, as needed to adjust pH \n\n Water for injection, to 1 ml_ volume \n\n\n The pH of the final product was adjusted to pH 5.75 ± 0.05 with 1 N NAOH or 1 N HCI, as required. The resulting solution was filtered through a sterile 0.22 micron filter prior to vialing, and was stored at 5 °C until used. \n\n\n An alternative formulation of the construct of formula IV was made for pharmaceutical use, similar to the formulation above, but additionally including between about 0.02 mg and 0.06 mg of disodium pamoate, such that the resulting solution was a pamoate suspension. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 3 \n\n\n In a human clinical trial of a subcutaneously administered formulation in which the construct of formula IV was the active pharmaceutical ingredient, the half life of the construct of formula IV was determined to be approximately 3 hours. The construct of formula IV lead to a mean peak increase in plasma cGMP concentration of 1.7 ng/mL at a dose of 0.3 Mg/kg of the construct of formula IV as a single, subcutaneous injection. \n\n\n Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the plasma samples was extracted using a protein precipitation method. cGMP and internal standard, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), were separated using a HPLC technique and detected by an Applied Biosystems API-4000 liquid \n\n\nchromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) with turbo-ion spray ionization (electrospray) in positive ion mode. Positive ions were detected in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with \n\n\nPrecursor→Product ion pairs of 346.3→152.1 for cGMP, and 330.0→136.3 for cAMP. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 4 \n\n\n Natriuretic peptide receptor binding affinity (expressed as K,) of the construct of formula IV (0.01 nM - 1 μΜ) was evaluated using 3 human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell lines expressing recombinant human, dog, or rat NPRA. The K, values of the construct of formula IV for human, dog, and rat NPRA were 1 , 41 , and 10 nM, respectively (Table 1 ). \n\n\n Table 1 \n\n\n Comparison of Affinity (K,) and Functional Potency (cGMP Generation; EC\n50\n and E\nmax\n) of the Construct of Formula IV for Human, Dog and Rat NPRA (Expressed in HEK Cell Lines). \n\n\n Results are given as Mean + Standard Deviation. \n\n\n Binding Function (cGMP) \n\n\n Receptor \n\n\n Ki (nM) n ^max \n\n\n ECso (nM) n \n\n\n (% of ANP response) \n\n\n Human NPR-A 1 ± 1 45 2 ± 4 94 + 8 51\n\n\nDog NPR-A 41 ± 26 6 3 ± 1 94 + 1 1 5\n\n\nRat NPR-A 10 ± 3 4 14 ± 9 98 + 7 47 \n\n\n As shown in Table 2, selectivity of the construct of formula IV for NPRA versus the other natriuretic peptide receptors, NPRB and NPRC, were determined in in binding studies in HEK cell lines. The construct of formula IV had a K, of 7 + 1 nM (n=4) for human NPRC, which is believed to be primarily a clearance receptor, and which is approximately a 7-fold lower affinity than for NPRA. The construct of formula IV was without effect (in concentrations up to 10 μΜ) in NPRB functional assays (cGMP generation; n=8). \n\n Table 2 \n\n\n Comparison of Affinities (K,) and Functional Potencies (cGMP Generation; EC\n50\n and Emax) of the construct of formula IV, hANP (human ANP) and hBNP (human BNP) for hNPRA (human NPRA), hNPRB (human NPRB) and hNPRC (human NPRC) (expressed in HEK cell lines). \n\n\n Results are given as Mean + Standard Deviation. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The natural natriuretic peptides, hANP and hBNP, have equivalent or higher affinity, respectively, for NPRC than NPRA, as compared to the construct of formula IV, which is 7-fold lower. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 5 \n\n\n Endogenous natriuric peptides, such as hANP, hBNP and hCNP, are rapidly degraded by neutral endopeptidase (NEP). The reported human plasma half-life for hANP, hBNP and hCNP is about 2 minutes, 20 minutes and 2 minutes, respectively (Potter, L.R., Yoder, A.R., Flora, D.R., et al. \"Natriuretic peptides: their structures, receptors, physiologic functions and therapeutic applications.\" Handbook Exp. Pharmacol. 191 :341 -366 (2009)). A comparison was made between the sensitivity of the construct of formula IV and ANP to metabolism by human NEP (hNEP) (substrate concentration 50 μΜ). After 2-hour exposure to hNEP solution at 37°C, there was minimal degradation of the construct of formula IV (92% remaining; n=5). In contrast, under these conditions ANP was about 90% degraded after 60 minutes and 100% after 2-hours (n=4). Similarly, for CNP there was 39% remaining after 60-min incubation with hNEP, and 1 % after 2-hours (n=1 ). Results are shown in FIG. 1 ; results in FIG. 1 are expressed as the percent of the starting material, and are either the mean of 1 -5 experiments or, where error bars are shown, are the mean + standard deviation. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 6 \n\n\n The construct of formula IV (0.1 nM - 10 μΜ) produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of guinea pig trachea precontracted with the muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol, with an IC\n50\n of 42.7 nM (n=3). The maximum relaxation elicited by the construct of formula IV was 83.6% of that produced by the positive control, beta2 receptor agonist, salbutamol, as shown in FIG. 2. hBNP (0.1 nM - 10 μΜ) also produced a concentration-dependent relaxation of precontracted guinea pig trachea, with an IC\n50\n of 10.7 nM, and a maximum relaxation that was 90.3% of that produced by salbutamol (n=3), as shown in FIG. 2. The potency difference between BNP and the construct of formula IV in this assay (hBNP is about 4-fold more potent) is similar to the differences in binding affinities (hBNP has about 5-fold higher potency) in guinea pig lung preparations. Results in FIG. 2 are expressed as mean + SEM; n=3. \n\n EXAMPLE 7 \n\n\n Male Wistar rats weighing 250 + 20 g were used. The animals were sacrificed by C0\n2\n overexposure and 3 tracheal rings are isolated from each animal. The tracheal ring tissue was placed under 1 g tension in a 10 mL bath containing Krebs solution pH 7.4 and indomethacin (2.8 μΜ) at 37° C and submaximal tonic contraction was induced by 1 μΜ carbachol after a 45 minute equilibration period. Relaxation in tracheal rings pre-contracted with carbachol (set as 100% control response) was tested with the construct of formula IV in varying concentrations to determine inhibition of contraction. At a concentration of 0.1 μΜ, the construct of formula IV resulted in inhibition of contraction (relaxation) of 6%, at a concentration of the construct of formula IV of 1 μΜ resulted in inhibition of contraction (relaxation) of 10%, and at a concentration of the construct of formula IV of 10 μΜ resulted in inhibition of contraction (relaxation) of 19% (all percentage values are an average of triplicates). \n\n\nEXAMPLE 8 \n\n\n The relaxant effects of the construct of formula IV were examined in a novel human precision-cut lung slice preparation method (Cooper, P.R. and Panettieri, R.A. \"Steroids completely reverse albuterol- induced \n2\n-adrenergic receptor tolerance in human small airways.\" J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2008;122:734- 740 (2009)). Assessment in tissues from 4 human lungs demonstrated that the construct of formula IV (0.1 nM - 100 μΜ) produced a potent, concentration-dependent but small relaxation of tissues precontracted with carbachol (1 μΜ), as shown in FIG. 3). The IC\n50\n (of the maximum relaxation induced by the construct of formula IV) for the construct of formula IV was 32 nM and the maximum relaxation, obtained at 1 μΜ, was 22% of the contractile response to carbachol. hBNP (0.1 nM - 100 μΜ) also relaxed precontracted human lung preparations with an IC\n50\n of 1.3 μΜ, and a maximal relaxation 23% of the carbachol-induced contractile response (n=2). Thus, the construct of formula IV is 30-fold more potent and as effective as the natural ligand, hBNP, in relaxing this in vitro human lung preparation. Isoprenaline (100 μΜ), the full beta\n2\n-receptor agonist, produced about 75% relaxation of carbachol-induced contraction. FIG. 3 depicts comparison of the relaxant effects of the construct of formula IV and hBNP in human lung slice preparations contracted with carbachol. The results are the Mean + SEM from at least 4 sections from 4 (construct of formula IV) or 2 (hBNP) separate lungs. EXAMPLE 9 \n\n\n Using the methods of Example 8, it was found that the construct of formula IV (10 μΜ; n=4) potentiated the relaxant effects of isoproterenol in human lung preparations precontacted with carbachol, whereas hBNP (10 μΜ; n=3) had no such effect, as shown in FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B. FIG. 4A shows the effect of the construct of formula IV on human lung preparations precontacted with carbachol, while FIG. 4B shows the effect of hBMP on human lung preparations precontacted with carbachol. Isoproterenol- mediated broncho-dilatation was 88.2 ± 3.4% in the absence of the construct of formula IV (10 μΜ) and 108.5 ± 5.0% in its presence (n = 4; P = 0.04). \n\n\nEXAMPLE 10 \n\n\n Studies were conducted with intratracheal (IT) delivery of the construct of formula IV in \n\n\nanesthetized guinea pigs (Dunkin Hartley) challenged with the muscarinic receptor agonist, methacholine. The construct of formula IV (1-1000 μg/kg, IT, n=6) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the \n\n bronchocon stridor response evoked by aerosol challenge with methacholine (10 pg/mL) challenge, as shown in FIG. 5A through FIG. 5F. For doses of 10, 100 and 1000 pg/kg (FIGS. 5C, 5D and 5C, respectively) a significant (P < 0.05) maximum inhibition of 43 ± 4%, 63 ± 5% and 70 ± 3%, respectively, was observed after 15 minutes pretreatment with construct of formula IV. The inhibition was maintained for all doses after the 60 minute pretreatment time. The duration of action of 10 g/kg and 100 g/kg doses of the construct of formula IV was explored (FIGS. 4C and 4D). For both doses the inhibition extended to 120 minutes post-administration, although it was reduced, with inhibitory effect absent after\n\n\n240 minutes pretreatment. Administration of the positive control beta\n2\n-receptor agonist, salbutamol (1000\n\n\nMg/kg, IT, n=6) significantly inhibited (by 87%) the bronchoconstrictor response evoked by methacholine (10 Mg/mL) challenge, reaching a maximum inhibition of 87 ± 2% after 15 minutes (FIG. 4F). \n\n\nEXAMPLE 1 1 \n\n\n A patient with an acute asthma attack or COPD is administered a formulation including the construct of formula IV, including a formulation such as described in Example 2, by means of \n\n\nsubcutaneous injection. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 12 \n\n\n A patient with an acute asthma attack or COPD is administered a formulation including the construct of formula IV, including a formulation such as described in Example 2, by means of inhalation of a nebulized solution. \n\n\nEXAMPLE 13 \n\n\n A patient with an an acute asthma attack or COPD is administered a formulation including the construct of formula IV by means of a drug powder inhaler. \n\n\nThe preceding examples can be repeated with similar success by substituting the generically or specifically described reactants and/or operating conditions of this invention for those used in the preceding examples. \n\n\n Although the invention has been described in detail with particular reference to these preferred embodiments, other embodiments can achieve the same results.
